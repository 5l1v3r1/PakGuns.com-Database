These are recognizable as the Roof prism have straight barrels ( the objective lense and the eye piece are in line) and the Porro have bulging sides and are heavier and bulkier the eye piece and the objective lens are not in a straight line.\nThe porro is a very old design but it is brighter, and takes a lot of punishment without being damaged when dropped or mishandled, and even if not of a top make it is usable; on the other hand the Roof Prism are lighter, less bulkier but very difficult to properly collimate with the result these are not really usable unless of  a top maker. These can be damaged easily as if dropped these can easily go out of collimation. The very top makers are how ever very robust and as bright and comfortable to use as a good quality porro. Good quality binoculars of both types by top makers are are nearly as expansive or twice as expansive as a new rifle. \nTo judge the quality of a bincular one has to examine it closely, pick up a bino and hold it at an arms length and look at the eye piece, you will see the eye piece will appear black with a small bright circle,  the bright circle is known as the EXIT PUPIL.\nThis is the effective area through which you see.\nWe will go through some definations so the young hunters are with us. The Eye Piece is the lens next to the eye when you view through a bino.\nThe OBJECTIVE lens is the one at the far end of the bino.\nThe figures 8x 40 mean; Magnification is 8 times and the Diameter of the objective lens is is 40 mm.\nFigures 6-24 x50 would be on a zoom bino which means the magnification is zoom able from 6 to 24 times and the obj lens dia is 40 mm.\nNow if you divide the obj lens dia by the magnification you will get the diameter of the EXIT PUPIL, also the exit pupil should be round and sharp otherwise you can tell it is of poor quality and some lense or prism is mis aligned.\nNow in low light the human eyes pupil dailates to about 7mm so if you want to use your bino in low light you can not take advantage of a bino which is say 10x30 as the exit pupil would be only 3 mm and  your eye would be 7 mm and you will find it very hard to use  due to black circles interfaring with your vision.\nIn low light a bino with 7x50 is ideal along with 8x56, and the 7x42 or the 10x40 a good compromise as the binos with larger objective lenses are heavier and bulkier.\nAll binos appear to be the same in bright light when you view through these for a short while. I wish you do not experience the murderous headache that follows after using a poor quality or out of collimation bino in the field as one glasses for hours looking for Ibex or Urial and only a few minutes is enough to ruin your day.\nIn the field one can handle only a 10 x bino that also sitting down and resting ones fore arms, easier to use are 7 or 8 x anything bigger than 10 will be unsteady .\nI think I will touch other aspects later.\nAll experienced hunters will use binos with a magnification of 6 or 7 or 8 and 10 in case of mountain hunting in mostly bright light. \nAnimals move during low light early in the morning or late evening that is when these figure stand out.         \nI would like to suggest that keep magnification on the lower side and the size of the objective lens around 40 mm or more.\nThen there are the sharpness, resolution,colour correctness and other aspects I will submit later', 0, 1, '119.154.57.8', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2413, 61487),

One should shoot him twice, at least, or "tap" him twice, which grew into the phrase, "double tap."\n\nI was trained in law forcement to shoot twice and then assess.  The proverbial "double tap"  and assess.  But even that has fallen into disfavor with LE.  Officers would shoot twice, stop shooting, and get hurt or killed because even after being shot twice sometimes the threat hadn''t stopped.\n\nAnother thing happened to the double tap- it became a speed contest.  Everyone seeing how fast they could draw and shoot two shots.  If you look at both IPSC/USPSA and IDPA style sport shooting you will see that each target has to be shot twice (except for steel targets which will fall down).  This is the direct decendent of the "double tap."\n\nThe problem with too much speed is loss of accuracy.  People stopped aiming two shots. When this guy states, the double tap is a "two well aimed shots with very little time between," he is absolutely correct:\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbg2s2bfjhw[/url]\n\nThough there is truth in the statement, "any shot which hits him, is good for me and bad for him;" there is also truth in the fact that some guys will not stop just because you shot off his earlobe.  So our shots will always need to be, "aimed."\n\nHowever, "aiming" is term which is different from "sighting."  Sighting refers to using the sights, but not all shots have to be aimed with the sights, they can be aimed by pointing the forearm at the threat in very close distances.  It can also be aimed by extending the arms in a two handed grip and seeing the gun imposed upon the threat.  \n\nPlease allow me to make clear- it is dependent upon how close the threat is and how well you can shoot.  If the threat is more distant, you will need use the sights.  But it is possible to hit an 8" circle out to 11 yards without "sighting" and only "aiming."  In these videos I shot a Glock 17 from which the sights were removed. I simply aimed the gun through orientation of the firearm on the target:\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ymH3qcHPA[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K89okVqEjEQ[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDNW9BL-UmE[/url]\n\nSorry, I got off track there.\n\nBack to the "double tap."  As I was saying the double tap fell out of favor because officers shot twice, stopped... and were hurt or killed because they ceased trying to stop the threat.\n\nCurrently law enforcement in the U.S. is being taught to shoot until the threat has stopped, and to shoot only as fast as can make accurate hits.  Often this is qualified as an 6" - 8" circle in the center or upper center chest.  \n\nIn slang terms, "you pour bullets into the threat" until the threat stops or turns away or drops the weapon.  It may mean one shot, or three or thirteen.  Whatever it takes to stop the threat.\n\nThere is a saying which goes along with this understandin: "if I''m justified in shooting him once, I am justified in shooting him a bunch of times."  \n\nIt''s part of the reason why you hear about American cops shooting a person a whole bunch of times- they were justified because the threat had not stopped being a threat.\n\nRemember:\n\nIf the threat is close, you can shoot faster/aim with less confirmation.  As the distance to the threat increases you have to shoot slower/have more confirmation.\n\n[img]http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/7237/29163048jb7.jpg[/img]\n\nIf you introduce movement (your movement to avoid a knife, the threats movement, or both) you will need to "aim" more.\n\nBut you shoot until the threat is stopped.\n\nWhen my wife and I practice she will shoot the target up to 5 times with her Kahr CW9.\n\nThe shoot until the threat has stopped philosophy has already been warped into how many shots can one shoot in a single second.  If you search you tube you will see some people who are posting videos that they can fire, 4, 5, 6 or more shots in a single second.', 0, 1, '69.148.197.108', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2483, 61820),

There is no guarantee that the gun fight you find yourself in will be anything like you imagined or what you trained for, but fast accurate shooting always helps.\n\nI''ve heard the following stated:  Situations dictate tactics, tactics dictate techniques, techniques dictate nothing.\n\nYou deal with the reality of the situation first, decide what tactic you will employ, and use the proper technique for that tactic.\n\nAnother mentality is to, "have a lot of tools in your tool box."  I know it sounds a little cliche.\n\nIt means don''t just be able to shoot accurate at 25 meters, be able to shoot fast and accurate at 7 meters. Be able to shoot accurately and fast while moving to the rear and obliques. Be able to draw fast and shoot rapidly at a target right on top of you.

In fact, it can be done in less than 1 minute! But for this you need to have at your disposal a cartridge type laser boresighter corresponding to the caliber of ammo your gun fires. Insert it into the chamber and bolt your rifle. Now target anything at the distance you wish to zero your sight at and adjust the knobs of your sight, both the X and Y so that the red dot that you see within your sight overlaps the red dot being emitted from your barrel! Your sight is now zeroed at this distance! I did this with a 9mm handgun, a friend of mine had the laser cartridge and we zeroed in the gun without a single fire. The manual way, if you do not have a laser boresighter is a bit more complicated and tricky. You need a  solidly grounded bipod for this to mount your gun onto. Now after determining the desired distance you wish your gun zeroed in to, it would best to use a target board to fire at. First fire would be the genuine line and length of your gun-barrel. Now look through your scope and aim at the hole on the target board that your first bullet made and fire again. Measure the distance in inches between the two shots and start adjusting your scope accordingly. Usually one click in either direction, both of X and Y, moves the aim of the scope about 1/4 of an inch. The whole process should be over in less than 15 shots if you work persistently. Yet, I must say the laser boresighter, if available, is best and easiest way to deal with this matter. You won''t even need to step out of your house, it can be done in the backyard even! As regards your last question, Eutech and Aimpoint are the best of red dot scopes available abroad, even used by U.S army. Prices of these start from around $400 to $700.

I had to ask him twice, whether if he meant the whole set or a single cartridge and he told me that he was charging 20000 for each of the rounds in the set! Thus 1 lakh for the whole set of 5, the original price of which would not be more than 100-150 U.S dollars, if possible to have imported directly or via somebody returning from abroad.

The manufacturer may be of one opinion, me another and someone else of a thrid opinion.  \n\nOne option is to not truly zero it (meaning the bullet hits the red laser dot.  \n\nInstead "zero" at 15 yards so that the red dot is 1" below the point of impact if the laser is 1" below the bore.  Or the red dot is 1" to the 4 o''clock of point of impact if that is where the laser is placed.   \n\nAt 15 to 25 yards you really can''t tell a 1" difference anyways.  But if you "zero" for 5 yards, at 10 yards it is 1" off at 15 yards it is 2" off, at 20 yards it is 3" off and 25 yrds it is 4" off, which is two times the difference for than the non-zero.   \n\nWhat''s 4" ?? I don''t know, maybe a miss, maybe not, which is the point.

Sometimes (rarely) it means inside a "darkened" place like and alley or poorly lit space.  \n\nThis isn''t surprising given that criminals like the dark as it hides them and makes identifying them more difficult.\n\nBut diminshed light does not mean total darkness.

And note how the lighting on and inside your home and others affects your ability to see a potential threat or identity a weapon. Lights shining in your eyes from behind the threat are bad for you and good for him.  The revearse is true, if the light is behind you it illuminates him, your sights, and makes it difficult for him see what you are doing.  A really bright flashlight is a great aid.

Wearing eye protection is a must. The lizards also fly away with the pellet and land at a considerable distance. At distances using open sights this airgun is adequate enough for the task. If i has got a higher powered airgun the ricochet would have been lethal and the risk of over kill significant. I can safely use it at my home in karachi as i know the airgun''s limit. If i had a more powerful airgun i would not have been as comfortable using it inside the house or outside in city environment.\n\nIt is proven by hadith that it is ok to kill house lizards.

Now, as far as your red dot sight is concerned, Denovo 87 is quite right that most of these available over here have no magnifying factor, mostly just 1x and rarely just 2x, not enabling you to conveniently target distant objects. Secondly, I''m not quite sure they would be able to retain zero settings for too long, when used for the heavier calibers, for this you would need as I stated earlier the Eotech and Aimpoint types, which are far more expensive and also hard- getters. One option could be that you went for a good quality illuminated reticle scope with a magnifying factor. It depends, what you want to use it for, if Ibex hunting, than definetely 1x or 2x wouldn''t serve your purpose at all. If you need the sure-shot aiming capability just for SD purpose, another good option is to have your gun mounted with \na reasonably good quality laser sight. The ones for rifles are larger in size than the ones for handguns and they are pretty accurate. Excellent hip-fire plinking! No aim, no need to bring your gun to shoulder position! Just point and shoot! My latest addition is the more rare one with green colored laser beam, clearly visible in even broad daylight! In fact, to some extent, they even can be used for hunting purposes. If you want to google it up, type LXGD JG-4 laser sight, which is red, and LXGD JG-10, which is the one with green laser.

Then they wonder why they can''t hit anything. The easy answer is, they''re out of sync. \nThis problem is easily corrected with some pre-season shooting practice. A dove field is one of the best possible training grounds for waterfowl hunters. Doves present the same relative angles and distances as ducks and geese, shooters get to practice these shots repeatedly. Shooting sporting clays is another practice option. \n\n[u][b]DUCK SHOOTING[/b][/u]\nWhen a flight of ducks comes into the decoys, many hunters shoot...at the flight! They don''t single out one bird, and concentrate strictly on it. An incoming flight of ducks is 95 percent air. This is why you need to lock in on one bird, and stay with it until it drops. Don''t "flock shoot." Don''t switch targets. Don''t let the excitement of the moment shatter your focus.\nTake the last or highest bird in an incoming fight. When ducks or geese are about to land, most hunters focus on the closest, lowest, easiest shot, and two or more hunters wind up shooting at the same bird. Instead, take a trailer with the first shot. Then your shotgun will be in the right plane to shoot flaring birds on the second and third shots. Also, you''ll have the satisfaction of knowing you downed birds that no other hunters were shooting.\n\n\n[b]DUCK SHOOTING PACKAGES.[/b]\nMany hunters from Pakguns.com forum, asked me about duck shooting packages.\nHunting Masters going to restart duck shooting services; with effect from 3rd week of October 2009.\nShooting spots should be downstream Head Marala, upstream Head Khanki, upstream Head Qadar Abad, and upstream Head Rasool. \n[u][b]SERVICES[/b][/u]\n1.

Time plus accuracy are more important. A not very well placed shot may not stop the threat but can buy you some time for a second shot. A well placed double tap with 9mm JHP or .357 Magnum will for sure, in most of the cases, stop the threat.\n\n2. Regarding practicing at close ranges, I have following to offer.\nUsually the administration does not allow to practice so close to targets as other members may inadvertently start shooting from 25 Yards thus endangering the security of members. Secondly at such a close range, if the stop butt is very close to target, the bullets may ricochet and endanger the firer. Yes if the stop butt is away then it may be possible. But for short ranges located in cities with no bullet arrestor at the top increases the ricochet chances if you pitch the target quite far away from the stop butt. And in some cases a head shot at a target pitched away from the stop butt, fired from a shorter height firer, may go straight in air or hit the top most area of stop butt thus favoring a ricochet.

I will not recommend giving it to youngsters until they develop a sense of responsibilty and maturity of thinking.\n\nWhat i mean is that one has to treat it with respect just like anyother firearm. If you dont treat it with respect it can cause you and your loved ones around you irreparable harm.\n\nWhile handling it make sure the safety is always ON only just before you shoot turn it OFF, Never point it at anyone or anything that you dont want to shoot at even if it is empty, while loading keep your finger away from the trigger and safety ON otherwise if fired in that position the barrel can hit you with tremendous force in the face or if you happen to put your finger at the break point (where the barrel breaks from the frame) can result in cut fingers. \n\nI am right handed, to load i place the Buttplate at my hip region and with gun pointed at an angle to my body using my left hand (grasping the solid end of the frame, no where near the trigger) and the Safety ON. I then grasp the end of the barrel with my right hand and load it. Then i put the pellet in using my right hand and then return the barrel to the earlier position again using right hand. All this time the gun is held solidly against my body with my left hand. In this position if the gun was to fire my right hand would have controlled the barrel hitting my face and during this entire action my fingers are no where near the breaking part that might have caused them to be cut in two.\n\nNow that the gun is loaded always point it in a direction where if the pellet was to be fired no harm would be done. You have to make a habit of using your brain quite often. You have to think each time before shooting at an intended target. You have to always plan for what if the pellet does not hit the target and what will happen if it hits the target. You should know ahead of taking your shot what will happen. For example when i shoot i look at what is behind the target (a mud wall or a concrete wall or a brick wall or a tree or a bush, a rubber tire) these are just a few examples and all will give different results like the mud wall will absorb the pellet in itself, the concrete wall will cause it to ricochet at tremendous speed, the brick wall will cause less speed ricochet, a tree if it is hard wood will cause tremendous high speed ricochet, a bush will let the pellet pass (now what is behind the bush?), a rubber tire will again cause high speed ricochet. \n\nNow with the speed and type of ricochet expected we will have to predict the angle of deflection. It is just like putting a ball in a hole at a game of pool or snooker. Remember Newtons law every action has an equal and opposite reaction. For example you hit a concrete wall at an angle of 45 degree from the left side it will deflect the pellet with speed towards the right at an angle of 45 degree. So you understand if you fire at the wall standing in front of it the pellet will come flying towards you (what if it hits you in the eye?).\n\nAllah swt has given you only one set of eyes so always wear eye protection. Not the ordinary glasses but polycarbon glasses. They are tough and will not shatter they are also used in bullet proof glass as layers. I got mine from Shaheen traders for Rs.1,500.\n\nAlso always make sure the people around you know you are shooting and ask them to move over if you feel the pellet can come there way.\n\nNow i hope you understand why this low powered air rifle when compared to gamo shadow is best for use inside home, and in city. The limit of ricochet can be judged and the possibility of overkill minimised. Overkill is if the pellet does not hit the target it can travel at lethal speed and hit something behind it like a man passing on the road. Or the pellet can pass right through the targets body and hit something behind again at lethal speeds.\n\nNow if i had the same gun in .17 caliber instead of .22 the pellet would have generated more speed therefore the possibility of high speed ricochets and overkill would have been more.\n\nAlso .22 is more suitable for hunting because .17 pellet is only useful if you make a head shot. if you take a body shot the pellet will either pass through and the animal will run away or if you are lucky the pellet will hit a bone. With .22 a head shot will work and the body shot will put the animal in a state of shock and you will have time to put another pellet into it. Also it will penetrate and stay inside the body of the victim.\n\nANOTHER IMPORTANT THING LEAD IS POISONOUS, can cause CANCER and IMPOTENCY.

I think by mistake you posted the thread twice, so may be the moderators can adjust it.\n\n\nSyed Sahib, I went through the complete package rather your complete site but failed to find a single mention about your service charges. No where you mentioned about any price. I do not think that most of our hunting /  safari companies or for that matter any company gives the  prices. Could you tell why? I mean it is some business secret? But if it is so then if you go on the sites of say South African, Ugandan, Kenyan even Namibian companies, they mention the price tag for the hunt including the services. So I believe it is nothing to do with a strategy :)\n\nThen why our companies are being too secretive? Is it some local marketing tactics, which I fail to understand or our companies'' price tags are so negotiable that they do not want to mention them (because of a later embarrassment) or they want to fleece people or what is the issue? I am not referring to your mail''s last para about Pak Guns hunters. I can understand why you wrote that. I am asking it from general public''s point of view. Any visitor touching your site will see all those beautiful pictures less the estimates. I hope I have not hit the "Achilles Heels"  :)[/quote]\n\n\nDear Malik Sahib,\n\nYour question is very good and important. Main reason is, other than Iran Turky, Aazerbaijan China, and Pakistan but only few more states are the natural hunting grounds. But in USA, Scotland, Africa & Australia is offering hunting at private ranches and normally they are feeding and caring to the game by artificial ways. \n\nMany game tags are designed for solo hunts or with non hunter group members. For these country hunter is having wide range of choice and contacts of many service providers matching with their budgets. But here is nothing.\nSo, they can easily define tag price, Tag prices are same, but price can be fluctuate according to services.\n\nIn Pakistan  Ibex, Urial, Markhore Blue Sheep tag prices are not secret but services charges by outfitters are the main secrets. Every out fitter is not a good hunter; outfitters are depending upon good guides in Pakistan. But every good hunter can become a good outfitter.\n\nFor Ibex , Urial & Markhor any body can become good host or agent if he is having little bit outdoor life experience, and become good business man in this field if he is having reasonable capital amount with basic knowledge of proceedings.\n\nVery few hunters are coming direct to Pakistani outfitters normally local out fitters are dealing with an agents (middle men), so by this way prices are high for hunters and outfitters are earning big profits.\n\nLocal out fitters are avoiding to the local hunters, because outfitter is earring big profit from foreigner comparatively local client. For example for the Wild Boar Driven hunt Price is 2800.USD to 3400.USD per hunter, normally recommended group size is 6 to 9 hunter, with minimum 5 hunting days.\nBut for the same services and the method of hunt you can’t earn this good amount, so why outfitter will deal with locals?\n\nBut Hunting Masters is is different we are working for promotion of local market.\nSecondly, technically problem is, for Wild Boar, Partridge, Duck shoot and for spotlight hunts we can’t publish exact prices for local or for foreigner, prices always stand for the required services and according to the number of joining members.\n\nWe can publish recommended group sizes, but prices will be different according to packages.\nSo, an easy way to get exact prices, first you send your requirements for the services,, duration of hunt and joining members. \n\nBest regards.\n\nSyed Ali Fazroq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.128.217', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2514, 62396),

And like the 6.5x55, it became a popular hunting cartridge world-wide. The 7x57 is another one of those well balanced cartridges that seems to kill game better than its paper specifications suggest that it should. Or maybe it is just that most of us fail to realize that increasing the velocity and power of a .284 inch bullet much beyond 7x57 levels gets us into the realm of rapidly diminishing returns. The longer .280 Remington and other similar capacity cartridges actually add little killing power, but their increased recoil and muzzle blast make it seem as if they do.\n\nThe truth is that the 7x57 has proven itself adequate for even the world''s biggest game under the right circumstances. The same WDM Bell that I wrote about in the section on the 6.5x55, famous slayer of African elephants for their ivory, used the 7x57 extensively. He appreciated the light recoil, accuracy, and deep penetration of the 175 grain FMJ 7mm bullet, and felt that the combination made a superb cartridge for executing elephants with precisely placed brain shots.\n\nFor the North American deer hunter, or the hunter of similar size game world-wide, the 139-145 grain bullets factory loaded to about 2700 fps make a good choice. These give the 7x57 a reasonably flat trajectory and hit plenty hard enough for most North American big game. Hornady offers a Light Magnum load that gives their 139 grain SP bullet a MV of 2950 fps. This makes the 7x57 an effective long range cartridge.\n\nThe 7x57, like many of the sensible cartridges, is under loaded by the major ammo companies in deference to the old military rifles that are still out there in the hands of the public. The official industry pressure for the 7x57 is 46,000 cup. 7x57 cartridges for modern rifles can be safely loaded to 50,000 cup, and this allows reloaders to drive the popular 139-140 grain bullets at about 2800 fps.\n\nFor large game like elk and moose, the 150-160 grain bullets are probably preferable, and these can be driven to velocities in the 2600-2700 fps range. The Norma factory load drives a 150 grain bullet at a MV of 2690.\n\nThe very heavy 175 grain bullets (SD .310) offer more penetration than is probably required for any North American game, but can be driven to about 2500 fps. The factory loads take this weight bullet to 2440 fps.\n\nModerate recoil makes for accurate shooting, and this has always been the 7x57''s forte. According to my Rifle Recoil Table, the 140 grain bullet at 2700 fps in an 8 pound rifle generates about 12.5 ft. lbs. of recoil energy. At 2800 fps the 140 grain bullet fired in the same rifle kicks with about 14 ft. lbs. of energy, still under the 15 ft. lb. level that allows most riflemen to do their best shooting.\n\nConsidering its all-around performance (including trajectory, killing power, and recoil) the 7x57 is nearly an ideal 7mm cartridge.

That''s for sure 99percemt of pb weapons are smuggled and not legally imported in the cou\ntry so I believe people have no option until either govt clearly bans weapons pb for everbody even politicians or make import or local sale through POF wah legal .\nWe know that pb mostly assault rifles and smg which are assault and not defence. \nOne will rarely find npb weapons tampering of no.', 0, 1, '58.65.153.233', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2503, 62479),

Shortly afterwards the director told me the man had brought out a Night Hawk Custom and a Wilson CQB.  He was letting people inspect and even shoot a few rounds through them.\n\nI quickly followed him to another part of the range and engaged him in conversation which I quickly turned to the two guns he had with him\n\nI recently read an article on the Night Hawk Custom T3, which was the same model he had with him.  I was really looking forward to fondling the T3 since the article so fawned over the T3.\n[url]http://www.nighthawktactical.com/T3_ultimate.html[/url]\n[img]http://www.nighthawktactical.com/t3/t3-uccp.jpg[/img]\nNow the pictures on the webpage are gorgeous.

I thought the black grips original to the T3 looked better.\n\nI shot it.  Oh, yes you bet I did!\n\nI was a bit dissappointed.  I humbly accept that such a statement sounds arrogant, but the trigger wasn''t great, a bit heavy and just kind of... unpleasant.  It was accurate.  It also was sort of displeased with the recoil.  Not that it was snappy or hard or twisted or such, I suspect that I am very used to the recoil of a full sized 1911.\n\nI appreciated the small and subtle but present magwell.\n\nNext the owner afforded me the chance to shoot the Wilson CQB.  \n[url]http://www.wilsoncombat.com/p_cqb_compact.asp[/url]\n[img]http://www.wilsoncombat.com/handguns/cqb_compact/large/12.jpg[/img]\n\nThis gun was also very accurate, the trigger was much better than the T3.  The recoil felt better, maybe it was a matter of spring weight or frame to slide fit.  Now if it had a magwell it would be about perfect.\n\nBoth guns fired a magazine without hiccup.  \n\nI reciprocated and let the owner fire my Kimber.

Neither the kid, nor the Glock were in the wrong. What was wrong was the person and the way he was carrying said gun.\n\nMr Skeeter, the following is generalized, not related specifically to Glock. Would I be right in saying that something which works for military and law enforcement may not necessarily be the best for civilian carry?[/quote]\n\n\nI totally agree that something which works well for LEAs may not work necessarily well for the civilians. There is nothing wrong with being a civilian, its just the training which matters. While most of the civilian gun enthusiasts at this forum may be more cautious and expert than an average LEA person but thats not true for all the civilians carrying arms. It would be better to have a chambered round with safety on rather than chambering the one at need or carrying a chambered weapon. I would also submit that unlike most LEAs, a civilian may not encounter a gun battle or there are very less chances, if I may put in these words, except for (GOD forbids) an HD / SD situation. Now you do not carry a loaded or even a chambered weapon at your house. Lets be practical guys. So for a person at home and trying to ward off a threat it is hardly an issue that the weapon is chambered or not. He has time. And if he is woken with a gun pointing towards his head, a chambered weapon is also as useless or as good as is a non chambered one. That is a hard fact. Most of us have never fired at a human being and I sincerely wish such a situation should not arise, however, if some one has fired he will bear me out that it takes more than a chambered weapon to fire at a human being. \n\nNot withstanding the last argument, I have always propagated revolvers for HD.

Such a deflection of bullet constitute a true ricochet". \n\nRicochet is phenomenon of a low rather than high velocity. This is because high velocity bullets such as .223 caliber travelling at 2800fps have a propensity to fragment upon impact rather than be deflected. This of course depends on the bullet design and composition, substrate composition and other variables like  bullet shape, velocity (and distance), target material and the angle of incidence. Steeper the angle less chances of ricochet. In rare cases, ricochets can return to the shooter. This occurs when the object struck possesses enough resistance to withstand the impact of the bullet, and whose surface is perpendicular to the shooter. Some bullets are designed to deform at the nose, which is the main reason for the bullet ricocheting at such an extreme angle and returning in the shooter''s direction.\n\nRicochets are often more common with low power calibers such as .22 or .177 calibre, which can have trouble penetrating some materials, although a ricochet can occur with any caliber.', 0, 1, '111.68.99.100', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2533, 62919),

The incident follows a series of scandals surrounding American use of private contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe raid on two offices of the Inter-Risk company is especially sensitive because of a slew of recent rumors and media reports that U.S. embassy expansion plans in Pakistan include hiring the security firm formerly known as Blackwater.\n\nThe U.S. says there is no truth in the reports, but they have resonated with the many Pakistanis familiar with allegations that Blackwater employees were involved in unprovoked killings of Iraqi civilians.\n\nPolice official Rana Akram said that two Inter-Risk employees were arrested and being questioned. He said authorities were also seeking the company''s owner, a retired Pakistani army captain.\n\nReporters were shown the weapons – 61 assault rifles and nine pistols – that were seized by dozens of police from the sites in pre-dawn raids in the capital, Islamabad.\n\nU.S. Embassy spokesman Rick Snelsire said the U.S. contract with Inter-Risk to provide security at the embassy and consulates took effect this year. It is believed to be the first U.S. contract for the firm, Snelsire said. He did not know how long the contract was for or what it was worth.\n\n"Our understanding is they obtained licenses with whatever they brought into the country to meet the contractual needs," he said. "We told the government that we had a contract with Inter-Risk."\n\nA man who answered the phone number listed for the company and identified himself as Riaz Hussain said a raid had occurred, but gave no more information.\n\nAccording to Inter-Risk''s Web site, it was first formed in 1988 and offers wireless home alarm systems as well as security guards and other services.\n\nThough the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad does have American security staff, much of the work is done by local workers. At checkpoints and gates leading to the embassy compound, for instance, Pakistani security guards inspect vehicles and log in visitors.\n\nScandals involving private contractors have dogged the U.S. in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nIn Washington on Friday, the Commission on Wartime Contracting heard testimony about another contractor – ArmorGroup North America – involving alleged illegal and immoral conduct by its guards at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan.\n\nEarlier this year, the Iraqi government refused to grant Xe Services – the new name for what was once Blackwater – an operating license amid continued outrage over a 2007 lethal firefight involving some of its employees in Baghdad, although the State Department has temporarily extended a contract with a Xe subsidiary to protect U.S. diplomats in Iraq.\n\nMany of the recent rumors in Pakistan have been prompted by U.S. plans to expand its embassy space and staff. Among the other unsubstantiated stories the U.S. denies: that 1,000 U.S. Marines will land in the capital, and that Americans will set up a Guantanamo-style prison.\n\nThe U.S. says it needs to add hundreds more staff to allow it to disburse billions of dollars in additional humanitarian and economic aid to Pakistan. The goal is to improve education and other areas, lessening the allure of extremism.\n\nPakistani reporters, anti-U.S. bloggers and others have repeatedly alleged that the U.S. is using Xe, and the issue continues to pop up in major newspapers despite U.S. Embassy denials. Xe Services officials could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. has signed a contract worth up to $18.3 million with DynCorp International, another U.S.-based security firm, according to federal records online.\n\nSome analysts say Islamist and other opposition groups may be planting the stories in the Pakistani press and blogs to portray Pakistan''s government as an American lackey.\n\nPakistani political analyst Talat Masood said Inter-Risk''s association with America "will increase the apprehensions that existed that the Americans are engaged in clandestine activities," and that the raid shows "the Pakistan government is asserting itself."\n\nThe U.S. considers stability in Pakistan critical to helping the faltering war effort in neighboring Afghanistan, and has pressed Pakistan to crack down on extremism on its soil. Al-Qaida and Taliban fighters are believed to use Pakistan''s northwestern regions bordering Afghanistan as hide-outs from which to plan attacks on Western troops in Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan has launched offensives against militants, but has also relied on some local militias to help fend off the Pakistani Taliban. Some of these militias share the same aims as the Taliban in Afghanistan, but disagree with targeting the Pakistani government.\n\nOn Saturday, one pro-government militia leader said the army had asked him to stop fighting the Pakistani Taliban. Turkistan Bhitani told The Associated Press that he and 24 aides surrendered their weapons to the army in the northwestern city of Dera Ismail Khan and that he had asked 350 of his men to do so as well.\n\nPakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, however, said he knew nothing of such an arrangement.\n\nAlso Saturday, a bomb at a security checkpoint in the northwestern region of Dara Adam Khel killed at least two people, local government official Aslam Khan said. He said police are still investigating if it was a suicide attack and determining the identity of the victims. Taliban fighters in Pakistan''s northwestern regions bordering Afghanistan frequently target security checkpoints.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lori Hinnant in Kabul, Riaz Khan in Peshawar and Ishtiaq Mahsud in Dera Ismail Khan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at: [url]http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/19/interrisk-company-uscontr_n_292249.html?page=2&show_comment_id=31308336#comment_31308336[/url] [/quote]\n\n\n\n[url]http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8265042.stm[/url]\n\n\n[quote]US embassy security firm raided  \n \nPolice allege that no licences were produced for the seized weapons \nPolice in Pakistan say they have raided the offices of a private security firm hired by the US embassy in Islamabad.\n\nThe offices of the Inter-Risk company were entered and around 70 weapons were seized and two personnel arrested. \n\nOfficials in Pakistan allege that the haul of 61 assault riffles, nine pistols and ammunition were unlicensed. \n\nIt follows allegations that the US is using the security firm once known as Blackwater. The US embassy in Islamabad denies it has any contract with them. \n\nThe media in Pakistan have reported that the US embassy in Islamabad was involved in hiring the firm Xe services, formerly known as Blackwater, a company which was embroiled in allegations of civilian killings while hired to protect US diplomats in Iraq. \n\nA spokesman for the US embassy, Rick Snelsire, has confirmed a contract with Inter-Risk exists and said that "It is our understanding they [Inter-Risk] obtained licenses [for] whatever they brought into the country to meet their contractual needs." \n\nThe US has denied it uses Xe services in Pakistan. \n\nA senior police official, Rana Akram, said that two Inter-Risk employees were detained and are being questioned. They were now seeking the company''s owner, a retired Pakistani army captain, the official added. \n\nPolice have denied any connection between the raid on Inter-Risk and the US embassy, but said they were working to protect foreigners living in the Islamabad and increasing vigilance ahead of the Muslim feast which marks the end of Ramadan.

I would like to visit their factory, but I keep delaying.  STI enjoys a stellar reputation for building great guns.  Their STI Single Stack and Sentinel Premier models are equivilent of the Kimber Supermatch II.  You will see a a lot of STI in competition and I believe that is quiet testimony to the quality and dependability of their products.

STI''s are- and they run and win.\n\nI can''t offer you much insight in to Ed Brown.  I have some of his after market products.  When a part breaks on my Kimber I replace it with an Ed Brown (if you shoot a lot, you will break parts, it just happens).

It has fixed chokes.\nAs far as Turkish O/U is concerned, I have Apollo, with five chokes, 28" barrel, single trigger and wooden stock. I have not used it much. Couple of rounds fired for skeet shooting. May be less than a box of 25. Since I,m good with my Baikal hence I did not practice much on this gun.

DSA owner (Mr. Nooruddin) replied: we use imported 4140 steel virgin bars for barrel making where NFAC owner Haji Majeed Gul replied: we use the best steel available in the market for our barrels and get it by melting old tyre rods and u know how strong a tyre-rod is.

Baikal''s patterns are absolutely fine as per standards and i''m absolutely amazed how casually people accuse Baikal''s pattern to be sub standard. I think this "baikal pattern is crap" myth is totally blown out of propotions. remember when somebody (experienced) says Baikal''s patterns are not impressive it means that on the open side of chokes its fine but on the tighter chokes it lack uniformity and density that is desired. all these problems can be easily fixed with aftermarket chokes available through Trulock, Clonial arms and carlson''s chokes. GUESS WHAT, AND DONT TELL THIS TO ANYONE (dont want to hurt the myth spreaders), COME CLOSE! "NOT EVERY BAIKAL SUFFERS FROM THIS ISSUE".\n\nu see, pattern is a tough cookie to crack, too many variables working for and working against the right pattern. even type of shotgun cartridges, load, cartridge length, choke type, barrel length and even the temperature of the barrel can give strange results. I''ve had same type of cartridges give totally different results. i''m sure u get my point.\n\n\nso, coming back to the track. go for a semi auto if u want and Baikal is absolutely fine. a 26inch (most approprite length for ur use) barrel baikal MP153 is as good as it gets in ur budget range. 28 inch will do too, infact I prefer 28 but people find 28inch a bit heavier for patridge hunting. if u want more fancy appearence then Hatsan Escort. but remember with fancier turkish offerings ur basically compromising on durability and reliablity.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.151.195', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2560, 63721),

MEANING: WD40 will not stay in ur weapon for long. it will evaporate as the weapon heats up, it will burn and leave carbon/ash which will further gumup ur weapon and will cause it to wear prematurely, something that can easily be eliminated with a speciality firearm lubricant.\n\nif u want to get the best homemade recipe, search the forum for Pakguns cleaner and if u want the best home made lubricant (best not because its homemade) kindly search for Pakguns lubricant.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s.

I hope mr 12 bore will be able to derive some information out of this data.\n\nIf i remember it correctly, there are three main categories of slugs, the hollow base ones (foster) the wad stabilized (brenneke) and the sabot slugs.\nthe most accurate of them all are sabot slugs which use a sabot to increase the projectile velocity ( a technique used in armor piercing rounds where increasing the charge and the bore of the projectile s not an option, so the velocity is increased by using a smaller bore sharp penetrating projectile weighing less hence increasing muzzle velocity. This projectile is sealed in the bbl using a sabot ) It has a similar trajectory to other slugs but sabot slugs result in tighter groups and high energy retention / transfer (to the target) properties. One thing that i couldn''t understand was that riffled slugs had muzzle velocity of 1750 fps where sabot ones had 1450 fps avg. This goes against all the standard rules and didnt make any sense to me.

Move carefully through their environment. \nDo not attract large predators by leaving food lying around your camp.\n Carefully survey the scene before entering water or forests.\n\n\nWalk carefully and watch where you step. Step onto logs rather than over them before looking and moving on. \n\nLook closely when picking fruit or moving around water. \n\nDo not tease, molest, or harass snakes. Snakes cannot close their eyes. Therefore, you cannot tell if they are asleep. Some snakes, such as mambas, cobras, and bushmasters, will attack aggressively when cornered or guarding a nest. \n\nUse sticks to turn logs and rocks. \n\nWear proper footgear, particularly at night. \n\nCarefully check bedding, shelter, and clothing. \n\nBe calm when you encounter serpents. Snakes cannot hear and \nyou can occasionally surprise them when they are sleeping or sunning. \nNormally, they will flee if given the opportunity. \n\nUse extreme care if you must kill snakes for safety. Although it is not common, warm, sleeping human bodies occasionally attract snakes. \n\n\n\nTicks can carry and transmit diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever common in many parts of the United States. Ticks also transmit the Lyme disease. \n\n[u][b]Mosquitoes[/b][/u]\n\nMosquitoes may carry malaria, dengue, and many other diseases. \n\n[u][b]Flies[/b][/u]\n\nFlies can spread disease from contact with infectious sources. They are causes of sleeping sickness, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery. \n\n[u][b]Fleas[/b][/u]\n\nFleas can transmit plague. \n\n[u][b]Lice[/b][/u]\n\nLice can transmit typhus and relapsing fever. \nThe best way to avoid the complications of insect bites and stings is to keep immunizations (including booster shots) up-to-date, avoid insect-infested areas, use netting and insect repellent, and wear all clothing properly.\n\nIf you get bitten or stung, do not scratch the bite or sting, it might become infected. Inspect your body at least once a day to ensure there are no insects attached to you. If you find ticks attached to your body, cover them with a substance, such as Vaseline, heavy oil, or tree sap, that will cut off their air supply. Without air, the tick releases its hold, and you can remove it. Take care to remove the whole tick. Use tweezers if you have them. Grasp the tick where the mouth parts are attached to the skin. Do not squeeze the tick''s body. Wash your hands after touching the tick. Clean the tick wound daily until healed.', 0, 1, '203.82.55.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1858, 64009),

Do not squeeze or grasp the stinger or venom sac, as squeezing will force more venom into the wound. Wash the sting site thoroughly with soap and water to lessen the chance of a secondary infection. \nIf you know or suspect that you are allergic to insect stings, always carry an insect sting kit with you. \nRelieve the itching and discomfort caused by insect bites by applying--\nCold compresses. \nA cooling paste of mud and ashes. \nSap from dandelions. \nCoconut meat. \nCrushed cloves of garlic. \nOnion. \n\n[u][b]Spider Bites and Scorpion Stings [/b][/u]\n\nThe black widow spider is identified by a red hourglass on its abdomen. Only the female bites, and it has a neurotoxic venom. The initial pain is not severe, but severe local pain rapidly develops. The pain gradually spreads over the entire body and settles in the abdomen and legs. Abdominal cramps and progressive nausea, vomiting, and a rash may occur. Weakness, tremors, sweating, and salivation may occur. Anaphylactic reactions can occur. Symptoms begin to regress after several hours and are usually gone in a few days. Threat for shock. Be ready to perform CPR. Clean and dress the bite area to reduce the risk of infection. An antivenin is available. \nThe funnelweb spider is a large brown or gray spider found in Australia. The symptoms and the treatment for its bite are as for the black widow spider. \nThe brown house spider or brown recluse spider is a small, light brown spider identified by a dark brown violin on its back. There is no pain, or so little pain, that usually a victim is not aware of the bite. Within a few hours a painful red area with a mottled cyanotic center appears. Necrosis does not occur in all bites, but usually in 3 to 4 days, a star-shaped, firm area of deep purple discoloration appears at the bite site. The area turns dark and mummified in a week or two. The margins separate and the scab falls off, leaving an open ulcer. Secondary infection and regional swollen lymph glands usually become visible at this stage. The outstanding characteristic of the brown recluse bite is an ulcer that does not heal but persists for weeks or months. In addition to the ulcer, there is often a systemic reaction that is serious and may lead to death. Reactions (fever, chills, joint pain, vomiting, and a generalized rash) occur chiefly in children or debilitated persons. \nTarantulas are large, hairy spiders found mainly in the tropics. Most do not inject venom, but some South American species do. They have large fangs. If bitten, pain and bleeding are certain, and infection is likely. Treat a tarantula bite as for any open wound, and try to prevent infection. If symptoms of poisoning appear, treat as for the bite of the black widow spider. \nScorpions are all poisonous to a greater or lesser degree. There are two different reactions, depending on the species: \n•	Severe local reaction only, with pain and swelling around the area of the sting. Possible prickly sensation around the mouth and a thick-feeling tongue. \n•	Severe systemic reaction, with little or no visible local reaction. Local pain may be present. Systemic reaction includes respiratory difficulties, thick-feeling tongue, body spasms, drooling, gastric distention, double vision, blindness, involuntary rapid movement of the eyeballs, involuntary urination and defecation, and heart failure. Death is rare, occurring mainly in children and adults with high blood pressure or illnesses. \n\n\n[u][b]Snakebites [/b][/u]\n\nSnakebites \nThe chance of a snakebite in a survival situation is rather small, if you are familiar with the various types of snakes and their habitats. However, it could happen and you should know how to treat a snakebite. Deaths from snakebites are rare. More than one-half of the snakebite victims have little or no poisoning, and only about one-quarter develop serious systemic poisoning. However, the chance of a snakebite in a survival situation can affect morale, and failure to take preventive measures or failure to treat a snakebite properly can result in needless tragedy. \nThe primary concern in the treatment of snakebite is to limit the amount of eventual tissue destruction around the bite area. \nA bite wound, regardless of the type of animal that inflicted it, can become infected from bacteria in the animal''s mouth. With nonpoisonous as well as poisonous snakebites, this local infection is responsible for a large part of the residual damage that results. \nSnake venoms not only contain poisons that attack the victim''s central nervous system (neurotoxins) and blood circulation (hemotoxins), but also digestive enzymes (cytotoxins) to aid in digesting their prey. These poisons can cause a very large area of tissue death, leaving a large open wound. This condition could lead to the need for eventual amputation if not treated. \nShock and panic in a person bitten by a snake can also affect the person''s recovery. Excitement, hysteria, and panic can speed up the circulation, causing the body to absorb the toxin quickly. Signs of shock occur within the first 30 minutes after the bite. \nBefore you start treating a snakebite, determine whether the snake was poisonous or nonpoisonous. Bites from a nonpoisonous snake will show rows of teeth. Bites from a poisonous snake may have rows of teeth showing, but will have one or more distinctive puncture marks caused by fang penetration. Symptoms of a poisonous bite may be spontaneous bleeding from the nose and anus, blood in the urine, pain at the site of the bite, and swelling at the site of the bite within a few minutes or up to 2 hours later. \nBreathing difficulty, paralysis, weakness, twitching, and numbness are also signs of neurotoxic venoms. These signs usually appear 1.5 to 2 hours after the bite. \nIf you determine that a poisonous snake bit an individual, take the following steps: \n•	Reassure the victim and keep him still. \n•	Set up for shock and force fluids or give an intravenous (IV). \n•	Remove watches, rings, bracelets, or other constricting items. \n•	Clean the bite area. \n•	Maintain an airway (especially if bitten near the face or neck) and be prepared to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or CPR. \n•	Use a constricting band between the wound and the heart. \n•	Immobilize the site. \n•	Remove the poison as soon as possible by using a mechanical suction device or by squeezing. \nDo not-- \n•	Give the victim alcoholic beverages or tobacco products. \n•	Give morphine or other central nervous system (CNS) depressors. \n•	Make any deep cuts at the bite site. Cutting opens capillaries that in turn open a direct route into the blood stream for venom and infection. \nNote: If medical treatment is over one hour away, make an incision (no longer than 6 millimeters and no deeper than 3 millimeter) over each puncture, cutting just deep enough to enlarge the fang opening, but only through the first or second layer of skin. Place a suction cup over the bite so that you have a good vacuum seal. Suction the bite site 3 to 4 times. Use mouth suction only as a last resort and only if you do not have open sores in your mouth. Spit the envenomed blood out and rinse your mouth with water. This method will draw out 25 to 30 percent of the venom. \n•	Put your hands on your face or rub your eyes, as venom may be on your hands. Venom may cause blindness. \n•	Break open the large blisters that form around the bite site. \nAfter caring for the victim as described above, take the following actions to minimize local effects: \n•	If infection appears, keep the wound open and clean. \n•	Use heat after 24 to 48 hours to help prevent the spread of local infection. Heat also helps to draw out an infection. \n•	Keep the wound covered with a dry, sterile dressing. \n•	Have the victim drink large amounts of fluids until the infection is gone.', 0, 1, '203.82.55.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1858, 64014),

Attaining 3000 ft/lbs in 12g at 50 yards ????,  For argument if you achieve the ME 3000 ft/lbs at 50 yards, I think you are missing the Recoil factor.\n\nLet’s take the example of Remington Buckhammer loads claim the most impressive ballistics of the bunch. The 12 gauge 2 3/4" load has a MV of 1550 fps and ME of 2935 ft. lbs. at Muzzle. The 50 yard figures are 1320 fps and 2177 ft. lbs. its kick like a donkey\n\nThe reason the slugs have so much recoil is simple physics......conservation of momentum: Mass Projectile x Velocity Projectile = Mass Gun x Velocity of Gun.\n\nA 12 ga (28gams= 432grains) slug and a 30.06 both have nearly 3000 ft - lbs of energy at muzzle. \n\nLet''s use the 2.75" 1.25 oz 1550 FPS slugs by Remington ......1.25 oz = 547 Grains! That is three times the weight of a heavy 180 grain 30.06...... And the 1550 FPS velocity is still 57% of the 30.06 at 2700 FPS.\n\nSo a 12 gauge slug and a 30.06 have the same energy.....but in the momentum department, the slug has 547 x 1550 = 848,000 vs 30.06 at 180 x 2700 = 486,000........848,000 / 486,000 = 1.75X.\n\n In your case slug (28g/432g) to Attaining 3000 ft/lbs in 12g at 50 yards , the velocity should be around 2400 FPS plus at muzzle: 432g x 2400FPS=1,036,800= 2.1X\n\nThe slug will give 2.1 times the recoil if the two GUNS are of the SAME weight. So, when you think of high powered slugs.....think of shooting a nearly double barrel 30.06 with both  barrels firing at the same time! enough energy to lift a man.\n\nIll rather stick to the Slug weight than to the velocity. Ill go for tried and tested moulds which can be loaded in our S shells and enjoy shooting.\n\nI would have simply order one of the cheapest moulds available from LEE Precision. 12g 1oz and 7/8oz available just for $27 with hollow base and a KEY DRIVE stabiles the slug. Other option is Lyman, which make hollow base and Sabot slug moulds they cost around $100.\n\nThe difference is Lee moulds are made of aluminum alloy and the other is made of iron. Both works well and fit standard shotgun wads and star crimped.\n\nPLEASE NOTE ANY SLIGHT CHANGE IN AMMO CAN INCREASE THE PREASURE TO DANGERIOUS LEVELS', 0, 1, '116.71.152.121', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1209, 64090),

Astigmatism  is an optical defect in which vision is blurred due to the inability of the optics of the eye to focus a point object into a sharp focused image on the retina. This may be due to an irregular or toric curvature of the cornea or lens. There are two types of astigmatism: regular and irregular. Irregular astigmatism is often caused by a corneal scar or scattering in the crystalline lens and cannot be corrected by standard spectacle lenses, but can be corrected by contact lenses. Regular astigmatism arising from either the cornea or crystalline lens can be corrected by a toric lens. A toric surface resembles the surface of an American football or a doughnut where there are two regular radii, one smaller than another. This optical shape gives rise to regular astigmatism in the eye. The first spectacle lenses that corrected astigmatism were made in Philadelphia in 1841. The refractive error of the astigmatic eye stems from a difference in degree of curvature refraction of the two different meridians (i.e., the eye has different focal points in different planes.) For example, the image may be clearly focused on the retina in the horizontal (sagittal) plane, but not in front of the retina in the vertical (tangential) plane. Astigmatism causes difficulties in seeing fine detail, and in some cases vertical lines (e.g., walls) may appear to the patient to be tilted. The astigmatic optics of the human eye can often be corrected by spectacles, hard contact lenses or contact lenses that have a compensating optic, cylindrical lens (i.e. a lens that has different radii of curvature in different planes), or refractive surgery\n\nAnd the doctor says about \n\n[u][b] Astigmatism[/b][/u]. Although astigmatism is the most common vision problem, most people don''t know what it is.\n\nAstigmatism may accompany farsightedness or nearsightedness. Usually it is caused by an irregularly shaped cornea (called corneal astigmatism). But sometimes lenticular astigmatism results from an irregularly shaped lens, which is located behind the cornea.\n\nEither kind of astigmatism can usually be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery\n\nAnother simple answer is \n\nAstigmatism means that the cornea is oval like a football instead of spherical like a basketball.  Most astigmatic corneas have two curves – a steeper curve and a flatter curve.  This causes light to focus on more than one point in the eye, resulting in blurred vision at distance or near.  Astigmatism often occurs along with nearsightedness or farsightedness.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsS4Xdr.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '111.68.99.100', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2578, 64140),

Introduced at the latest IWA expo in Nuremberg, Germany, this standard .9x19mm-Parabellum semi-automatic handgun is a prototype coming from a factory called "Daudsons Armoury", known as DSA, and located in Peshawar, Pakistan (see them at: [url]http://www.daudsons.org/);[/url] despite of its location, and the nature of the products displayed on its website, DSA operates with newest, state-of-the-art CNC machineries, and doesn''t manufactures only civilian weapons but it''s also a HUGE Pakistani defense contractor: at the IDEAS 2002 asian defence expo, DSA introduced the "AGL-40", a reliable 40mm automatic, belt-fed grenade launcher that ressembles to a rogue copy of the US-made MK-19 (there''s a picture of the DSA AGL-40 at: [url]http://www.pakdef.info/ideas2002/).[/url] \n\nThe design of this "DSA-9" pistol is evidently ripped off from a notorious Austrian product engineered by a man called Gaston... in fact it is a knock-off from the GLOCK 19. It is a mix of several generations'' Glock models, the trigger guard is different, but the slide will be probably made of metal instead than polymer, at least when the gun will enter production. No other news about this gun are available by now, except that this pistol has already been "coveted" by the Pakistani government as a possible widespread Paki Military/LE service pistol for the near future. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts10rSL0][img]http://www.postimage.org/Ts10rSL0.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '58.65.160.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2584, 64286),

Introduced at the latest IWA expo in Nuremberg, Germany, this standard .9x19mm-Parabellum semi-automatic handgun is a prototype coming from a factory called "Daudsons Armoury", known as DSA, and located in Peshawar, Pakistan (see them at: [url]http://www.daudsons.org/);[/url] despite of its location, and the nature of the products displayed on its website, DSA operates with newest, state-of-the-art CNC machineries, and doesn''t manufactures only civilian weapons but it''s also a HUGE Pakistani defense contractor: at the IDEAS 2002 asian defence expo, DSA introduced the "AGL-40", a reliable 40mm automatic, belt-fed grenade launcher that ressembles to a rogue copy of the US-made MK-19 (there''s a picture of the DSA AGL-40 at: [url]http://www.pakdef.info/ideas2002/).[/url] \n\nThe design of this "DSA-9" pistol is evidently ripped off from a notorious Austrian product engineered by a man called Gaston... in fact it is a knock-off from the GLOCK 19. It is a mix of several generations'' Glock models, the trigger guard is different, but the slide will be probably made of metal instead than polymer, at least when the gun will enter production. No other news about this gun are available by now, except that this pistol has already been "coveted" by the Pakistani government as a possible widespread Paki Military/LE service pistol for the near future. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts10rSL0][img]http://www.postimage.org/Ts10rSL0.jpg[/img][/url][/quote]', 0, 1, '59.103.215.193', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2584, 64924),

Pure lead doesn’t work and to convert into alloy has to go under lot of process.\n\nPlease forgive me “PakGuns Expert Panel” if I were you I would have not tried it, experimenting in developing mould for 12g Slug / velocity. Attaining 3000 ft/lbs in 12g at 50 yards ????,  For argument if you achieve the ME 3000 ft/lbs at 50 yards, I think you are missing the Recoil factor.\n\nLet’s take the example of Remington Buckhammer loads claim the most impressive ballistics of the bunch. The 12 gauge 2 3/4" load has a MV of 1550 fps and ME of 2935 ft. lbs. at Muzzle. The 50 yard figures are 1320 fps and 2177 ft. lbs. its kick like a donkey\n\nThe reason the slugs have so much recoil is simple physics......conservation of momentum: Mass Projectile x Velocity Projectile = Mass Gun x Velocity of Gun.\n\nA 12 ga (28gams= 432grains) slug and a 30.06 both have nearly 3000 ft - lbs of energy at muzzle. \n\nLet''s use the 2.75" 1.25 oz 1550 FPS slugs by Remington ......1.25 oz = 547 Grains! That is three times the weight of a heavy 180 grain 30.06...... And the 1550 FPS velocity is still 57% of the 30.06 at 2700 FPS.\n\nSo a 12 gauge slug and a 30.06 have the same energy.....but in the momentum department, the slug has 547 x 1550 = 848,000 vs 30.06 at 180 x 2700 = 486,000........848,000 / 486,000 = 1.75X.\n\n In your case slug (28g/432g) to Attaining 3000 ft/lbs in 12g at 50 yards , the velocity should be around 2400 FPS plus at muzzle: 432g x 2400FPS=1,036,800= 2.1X\n\nThe slug will give 2.1 times the recoil if the two GUNS are of the SAME weight. So, when you think of high powered slugs.....think of shooting a nearly double barrel 30.06 with both  barrels firing at the same time! enough energy to lift a man.\n\nIll rather stick to the Slug weight than to the velocity. Ill go for tried and tested moulds which can be loaded in our Shaheen shells and enjoy shooting.\n\nI would have simply order one of the cheapest moulds available from LEE Precision. 12g 1oz and 7/8oz available just for $27 with hollow base and a KEY DRIVE stabiles the slug. Other option is Lyman, which make hollow base and Sabot slug moulds they cost around $100.\n\nThe difference is Lee moulds are made of aluminum alloy and the other is made of iron. Both works well and fit standard shotgun wads and star crimped.\n\nPLEASE NOTE ANY SLIGHT CHANGE IN AMMO CAN INCREASE THE PREASURE TO DANGERIOUS LEVELS[/quote]\n\nYou have a very valid point. I dont think the desired energy levels are possible without decreasing the weight of the slug substantially (to balance high velocity in the momentum equation and keep the recoil constant), and increasing the muzzle velocity using a sabot design. To add onto that, the design will have to have really good balistics in order to retain the ME at 50 yrds plus.\nAny ways, my point is that the task is difficult nonetheless doable, and yes "trade offs" do and will, always, exist.', 0, 1, '202.163.71.194', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1209, 65155),

They may replace lost decoys with the oversized decoys a few at a time, but the smaller dikes still have a lot of wear left in them. They''re too valuable to toss.\n\nBut the important thing is to study hunters'' decoy ideas and tactics and see how they relate to your situation. There are effective ways to add motion – judiciously - without going overboard. \n\nThere are times when fine-tuning a spread to a particular species is as simple as adding some wood duck or pintail decoys. Painting a few mallard decoys flat black might increase a spread''s visibility.\n\nToo many hunters just toss out their decoys, hide and start calling.

Nitro Cards were originally used by black powder shot gunners to seal between the powder and the shot. Today in hand loading they are used as a fine-tuning spacer wad inside the shot cup. They can be added to any modern load where the shot cup is sitting too low for a proper crimp. Nitro cards are replaced by plastic over powder.\n \nThe term filler is a shock absorbing wads connects the disc and cup in the form of pairs  erected on either side of the axis of the shell.\n\nAmmo manufacturers still offer variations of this type of wads.\n\n\nPlastic wads are a single column wad with all the properties three wads. The simple fact the plastic wad one piece unit cup type plastic over-powder wads seals the powder gases much batter than nitro- card wads thus more efficient in powder usages and easy to use and produce the best all- round result. The filler is built in plastic wads, the spring type between over -powder wad and shot cup works as shock absorber.\n \n\nHOW CAN AN EXPERIENCED GUY SUCH AS URSELF CAN FIT A LARGER DIAMETER SLUG IN A SMALLER DIAMETER SHOTCUP BY PLACING \nFILLER WADS UNDER IT.  Do explain. we have a lot to learn from ur experience.\n\nThe fired shell cases available are high base cases they are strong because of thicker base wad and carry low brass heads. Plastic wads available here are of three types. The one is only plastic over- powder and filler wads for SG. The other two wads are for 31g & 24g have 2.2mm difference in total length but main difference between them is in filler and cup size. It''s very simple; I tied to explain in my pervious post 11. The Lee slug fits in skeet wads with slight adjustment and gives perfect star crimp. This mould has absolutely no issues in seating in the wad with a proper reloading press.\n\nI have not casted any other slug but John have reloaded few. A friend came to John with his very old 12 gauge Remington Express slugs, all were misfired. John reloaded them only using 26 grams Remington sabot. They were loaded with old type wads. It was time consuming to use 3 wads, so John  simply took 24grams wads, cut the cup for the shot shell and use the remaining wad (2 cm) as over-powder and filler and end result an excellent star crimp. They were around 43 in total, he was quite happy , since he has used all of them. \n\nWhat about the useless "moulds" with you\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '116.71.174.24', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1209, 65526),

I reloaded them only using 26 grams Remington sabot. They were loaded with old type wads. It was time consuming to use 3 wads, so I simply took 24grams wads, cut the cup for the shot shell and use the remaining wad (2 cm) as over-powder and filler and end result an excellent star crimp.

OOPS! same words. i''m sorry. cant think of any at the moment. Ok! how about next time u load some. take a vernier caliper and measure the OD of lee slug then measure the ID of a No. 4 shaheen Shotcup or trap load. then tell me do they fit?\n\nI guess I could just give u the numbers (difference in diameters) but then again u already know them. right?\n\nbro, we can have like a gazillion solutions to a problem however one must stick to his objectives and find a solution around it. thats what i''m doing here. I know I can just order pre-made slugs, I know I can use lee slugs with standard remington or winchester wads. heck! if i try hard enough I can probably find factory slugs 0.689inch diameter (u probably know the reason why this size is important). but whats the fun in that? why not solve the problem with the stuff available at hand? this project is not to prove to anybody else that I can make slugs. or to design a better slug that beats the foreign made slugs.

Change in summer/winter MV being new thing to me & lot of other members needs more explanation, would you please?[/quote]\n\nyes why not, the little i know I would tell Sir but a bit more explanation is appreciated by some of the professionals from this forum.\n\nSir your question indirectly touches a different aspect, subject discussed above rather was Super sonic nature of a bullet and effect of Weather/Temperature on it.\n\nOR we can simply say that; Change of weather/temperature does 2 different things:\n1- Alter the bullet''s Super Sonic threshold\n2- alters Muzzle Velocity/Muzzle Energy\n\n\n1- Alter the bullet''s Super Sonic threshold: Sound has different speeds in different medium. i.e water, air, other material etc. In atmoshpere, speed of sound is affected by the molecular dextarity. Change in temperature changes the molecular movement of air components. Thus change in temperature affects the travelling speed of sound in the air. Also we know that a bullet will be supersonic once it reaches velocity greater than that of sound. Thus different weather/temperatures will either increase or decrease the threshold of super sonic nature of the bullet. The same I have discussed in the above post regarding 9mm''s supersonic nature.\n\n2- alters Muzzle Velocity/Muzzle Energy: Change in Temperature/Weather changes the Interior Ballistics(refers to things going on inside the cartridge/primer). Rise of temperature will increase the flash point and speed of powder burning, as well as increase the same in primer. This will result in rise of pressure inside the cartridge. Thus finally affecting the (MV) and (ME) of a bullet. NOTE: Magnitude of it depends on type of powder being used, nearly all primers and powders are affected however.\n\nAlso for clearing the point, velocity of a standard 9mm round can be increased by putting it up in afternoon Sunlight in mid July for an hour.. BUT...... 9mm is less tolerable to minor changes in terms of interior ballistics(Experts please correct me if Iam wrong)due to case capacity. Therefore any hotter load once heated up in Sun can make excessive pressures resulting in blown out primer or case rupture and even a KB. \n~~~~(Please Never Ever Sunbath your ammunition for the sake of doing it)~~~~', 0, 1, '119.152.92.158', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2615, 65826),

Ammonia is known for attacking steel, i agree the concentration is very crucial for this to happen but when buying from a store in loose packaging its still a little risky and doubtful as to the concentrate level. Though you have clearly warned to ensure cleaning the barrel from any traces, i feel it is pertinent to point out the dangers of not being careful otherwise someone could ruin a perfectly good weapon by being a little casual with its use. \n\nHope you don''t mind the  warning, its not meant to criticize your efforts but some source for this formula would also be nice to authenticate the formula. \n\nAgain please do not be discouraged or disappointed, its just a concern.\n\nregards[/quote]\n\nBro, why would I ever mind anything that u say. I totally understand and fully appreciate constructive critisizm. Kindly allow me to clear your concerns.\n\n1. Ammonia doesnt actually attack steel/iron as its PH is too low to cause any harm.\n\n2. Ammonia does however promote rust on metal as it is severely hygroscopic (absorbs moisture), therefore its absolutely necessary to totally remove any residual ammonia solution from the bore. if u read "directions" u''ll see that i''ve insisted on washing the barrel afterwards with running tap water, since ammonia is highly soluble in water (ammonia solution ;) ), washing it with water (even momentarily) will totally remove any traces of it.\n\n3. As far as quoting sources is concerned, Sir its public knowledge/Information and with public knowledge, citing sources is not necessary. how its public knowledge, well......, ammonia is being used to clean copper fouling from barrels for over hundred years. infact if u google it u''ll find many homemade recipes (such as this one but with slight differences) using ammonia solutions in similar concentrations.\n\n4. as far as testing is concerned, kindly contact Dr. Zakir he''ll concur that I tested the solution on his barrel (and many of friends barrels) before posting. infact, a test barrel (7.62 TT) was soaked in straight ammonia solution for more than 10 hours just to see if it causes any harm. only after seeing satisfactory results I posted it here.\n\n5. as far as buying from a lose packing is concerned, remember I insisted on buying from lose packing as 1. lower ammonia content in the ammonia solution 2. only janitor''s ammonia solution is available in lose packing as industrial grade ammonia is very expensive and only available in fixed properly sealed packing of 1-2.5 litres. one more thing: even the janitors ammonia that i''ve used is diluted with liquid dish washing soap.\n\nI hope it addresses any of your concerns. I do however appreciate everyone of them.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.190.212', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2640, 65896),

We imagined that and built it – the result is the revolutionary KZ  and KZ Compact.\n\n The KZ is not like any other composite frame firearm. The KZ is what happens when you combine the science and technology of Kevlar-reinforced polymer with the art, engineering, and experience of Wilson Combat®. The KZ is setting the standard for polymer-frame pistols in performance, reliability, and accuracy - just like every Wilson. \n\nWe''ve permanently bonded a stainless steel insert with all the critical wear areas - pin holes, feed ramp, frame rails, etc - in a Kevlar-reinforced polymer frame for excellent strength and durability. Wilson Combat’s® design gives you two rounds more than a standard 1911 with a grip that is actually narrower, and an empty weight of only 34 ounces for full-size - the kind of benefit you want in a carry pistol, on the range, or in a tactical situation. And since it''s a Wilson Combat® firearm, we custom build it for you the way you order it: Tactical Combat sights or adjustable sights, single side Tactical safety or ambidextrous safety, full size or compact, even a light mount. The standard features are what you expect from Wilson - a precision fitted and installed stainless steel barrel, extended tactical thumb safety, our High-Ride beavertail grip safety, and Wilson Combat Tactical sight system with tritium inserts. And the best standard feature of any firearm in the world - Wilson Combat''s® maximum satisfaction lifetime promise of unparalleled customer service. \n\nA top shooter recently visited Wilson Combat and had his first experience with the KZ. "Build me one of these in a .40, and I can campaign with it," he told us. The KZ delivers that kind of confidence - and isn''t that what firearms are supposed to do?\n\n Whether you''re looking for your first Wilson, or your next Wilson - the KZ may well be the best value in our line of weapons.

(58504, 2006, 0, 'Ata', 554, '', 1254732184, 'If you want to judge with some degree of certainty how a particular bullet will perform on game within a certain velocity range, the surest method is to test it yourself.\n\nHandgun hunters who use specialty pistols such as Thompson/Center''s Encore and Contender often must use bullets designed for velocities outside the range of those generated by handguns of these types. Cartridges designed for revolvers produce higher velocities in the closed breeches and longer barrels of these specialty pistols, and bullets must be selected carefully to ensure that they do not come apart on impact at these higher velocities. \n \nThe author tested these Barnes TSX 6.8mm bullets in wet newspapers at various velocities to determine maximum effective range on deer-size game. The TSX is an excellent bullet at rifle velocities, but as it turned out it was not the best choice for the slower velocities of the 6.8mm SPC in a handgun.\n\nBy contrast, even the 14- and 15-inch barrels in use now with the T/C handguns produce considerably less velocities with rifle cartridges than the bullets may have been designed for, and care must be taken to ensure that the bullets will expand properly, especially at longer ranges.\n\nWhile there is a plethora of information and terminal test data available on self-defense handgun loads, little is offered on handgun hunting loads. Some bullet manufacturers offer basic information on expansion characteristics and optimum velocities, but if you want to judge with some degree of certainty how a particular bullet will perform on game within a certain velocity range, the surest method is to test it yourself.\n\nLow-Cost Bullet Testing\nBallistic gelatin is used by experts in both the private and government sectors to test and compare bullet expansion and penetration. Gelatin is fairly expensive, though, and it''s time-consuming to use correctly. The handgun hunter can fare quite well with less expensive and easier methods. \n\nWe do not need to meet exact scientific standards. The goal of the handgun hunter is simply to compare various bullets and determine within a reasonable margin of error which best suits his needs. All we truly need to know is whether the bullet will expand at the impact velocities likely to occur and how well it will remain intact and penetrate at these velocities.\n\nThere are two simple and time-honored methods for testing bullets in your backyard or at the range. One is to test in water, using containers of some type lined up in a row of sufficient length to stop the bullet. I use one-gallon milk and water jugs that I save as they are emptied. The other method is to soak newspapers in water until they are thoroughly saturated. While neither method will always tell you exactly how a bullet will perform in flesh, both will allow you to compare one bullet to another and set some standards of performance that, with experience, will allow you to predict a bullet''s performance on game with a fair degree of accuracy.\n\nTest at impact velocities\nSome backyard ballisticians only test at near muzzle velocity. This is a mistake. To accurately guesstimate how a bullet will perform downrange it must be tested at downrange velocities. This can be done by setting up the tests downrange and firing at various distances--easy enough if you have a couple-hundred-yard range in your backyard, but it can be a hassle at a public range.\n\nI prefer to down-load ammo to match downrange velocities. I set up a chronograph in front of the test medium and record velocities and document recovered bullet samples as I reduce the load in increments until I have tested from muzzle velocity to an impact velocity matching the longest distance I am likely to shoot. Any ballistic software program can be used to calculate downrange velocities. (A note of caution: When reducing loads drastically, be sure a suitable powder is used that is safe for reduced loads.\n\nA concern when using bottleneck rifle cartridges in handguns is that velocities can be fairly low even a couple of hundred yards downrange. Some rifle bullets only expand completely above 2,100 fps. When you start the bullet out at short barrel velocities of perhaps 2,400 to 2,600 fps, the bullet doesn''t have to travel far to drop below velocities required for optimum expansion. This is why lighter rifle bullets with thinner jackets often work best at handgun velocities.\n\nEvaluating the results\nTesting bullets in any substance is not an exact science. Water, wet newspapers and gelatin offer consistent resistance throughout the bullet''s path. Animals do not. But you can learn a lot from testing if you know what to look for. \n\nBasically, you are looking for three things. Does the bullet expand completely? Does it retain weight and penetrate sufficiently? And at what point does expansion occur?\n\nJudging expansion is easy. Either the bullet expands or it doesn''t. You can measure the expanded bullet with calipers, and if expansion is twice the bullet diameter, smile and be happy. You can also weigh the expanded bullet and determine the amount of retained weight. As much as high weight retention is touted by some, I have found that some weight loss is not only acceptable but desirable for certain game. \n\nWith medium game such as whitetail deer, handgun bullets that expand rapidly and shed some weight just seem to kill quicker in my experience. You still need enough retained weight to penetrate reliably, but do not get hung up on searching for 95 to 100 percent weight retention. High weight retention is, of course, desirable on larger, tougher game to ensure deep penetration.\n\nYou can judge how quickly and at what point a bullet expands by looking at the wound channel in wet newspapers. You can judge this to a lesser degree in water jugs. I number the jugs and then examine each after shooting. The jug with the most damage is where the most expansion occurred. This is usually the first jug, but it may be the second or third if the bullet is designed for slower expansion. You can also look at entry and exit holes on each jug and get a good idea of how much the expanded bullet diameter was at those points.\n\nJudging whether the bullet provides enough penetration is the most difficult aspect of testing. Here is where a control bullet is most useful. If you have a bullet that has performed well for you on the game, fire it into the test medium at various downrange velocities and use it as a benchmark upon which to judge other bullets.\n\nThe ultimate test of any bullet is how it performs on game. The main advantage of testing bullets before you go hunting is to eliminate bullets that are clearly not suited to the task. If a bullet will not expand in water jugs or wet newspaper at a given velocity, it likely will not expand in game at that velocity. Likewise, if the bullet breaks apart in these substances it will almost surely break up on game, especially if bone is hit.\n\nTesting your bullets is easy and a lot of fun and could prevent a lost wounded animal. If you test a variety of bullets on an ongoing basis you will gain experience as to how various bullets perform and will become more adept at judging a bullet''s potential based on these tests.', 0, 1, '124.29.242.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2652, 66036),

When a  bulletcase has more gunpowder loaded, it gives the projectile more power which gives higher velocity, and with higher velocity, higher energy! Thus, it would outdo a target much quicker than standard ammo. The more p''s the more power. However, bear in mind that not ALL guns can handle the increased gas pressure within the chamber! In normal guns, the increased power would lead to a quicker wear n tear, at times after consistent shooting and say after a few thousand rounds, all depending upon your care of your gun, may necessitate parts replacement, i.e recoil springs, etc. Additionally, your gun may jam occasionally. Also, remember controlling ability of the gun, whilst using +p ammo is adversely affected due to higher recoil! One must practice further to make shot placement better with this ammo. In my opinion, this is a defensive round, and if you''ve a gun that can handle it, only use it for SD, after practicing a few mags to get used to the recoil and judge your shot placement. I would not suggest it for routine practice/range shooting. Additionally, I would say, if your gun is not +p ammo specified, better go for the JHP ammo for SD, if you need increased power. Though JHP does NOT offer more pressure than standard ammo, it''s "flowering" feature leads to greater internal damage and thus more stopping power! I would however add, that in my opinion, our local P.O.F 9mm rounds have, to some extent, a + p factor added to them, if not the ordinary one, then at least the one for sten-guns that they produce, owing to which many users often feel jams with their guns, be it due to FTE or FTF!

I wanted to apply for my NPBs. He asked for about the average market price, and I paid him full advance.\n\nAbout two months later, I inquired. Nothing. I kept inquiring, and instead of giving me a real status, it was one Topi after another. What bothered me the most was the continuous, perpetual and circular lies that these people call business.\n\nWhat would have been more appropriate was him telling me that licences are closed. He never did. He kept saying next week. Then stopped picking up the phone, or answering emails or phone. Pathetic and unprofessional.\n\nI usually respect elders unconditionally, but his father sitting on the same desk was no different.\n\nDuring this time, I also asked to see weapons that he may have. Most of them were used, diesel serviced, local blued, oil washed weapons. I acted aloof to see how far he will stretch to screw his customer. A taurus with 500 rounds he says has only fired one clip, a Zastava recond (re-blued) he says is new.\n\nHe is also the Sarasilmazz agent supposedly. Hence, he tries to push it all the time. Kindly be careful on what you buy. Usually, when you ask them, when is the consignment coming, its one or two days, or tomorrow. Other than that, most of the pistols he showed me looked pretty, chromed barrels, machined receivers, BUT, look at the barrel thickness, look at the finish of megazines. Real poor in my opinion. I will stick with Taurus Brazil (Tore Ass to some) over the Turkish crap anytime. Stoeger is the only exception, where I have visited the factory, and know what materials they use. \n\nAs for my revenge, and I went to his shop and I told him what he is worth on his face. I believe not many are this confrontational, but I just cannot put up with liars and cheats.\n\nOverall, Lotia and specifically Azhar Bandukwala is a specific no no.

Using magnum pro pellet, I ''accidently'' broke the glass of the lamp post at 20 yards. My bad.\n\nHowever, my personal experience (which I really find surprising) is that both mine and my brother''s accuracy at 20 yards with Gamo Match Pellets (using scope) is 90%, while with the Gamo Magnum Pro it''s around 50% - 60%.

If we want to get a certain terminal energy say 3000 lb/ft with a projectile of 24grm at 50m the only variable at our hand that we can play with is velocity. This velocity can easily be calculated. Now peoblem will be to measure the exact ammount of suitable powder to acheive that velocity for a 24grm projectile. The only tricky part could be the chamber pressure if the charge is too much.\n\nSo, will the gun be able to handle that charge??? :|\n\nAnother thing can also be tricky, we increase projectile weight by say 10% the recoil of the gun increases by 20% similerly we increase velocity by 10% again recoil increases by 20%.

"The Russians will eventually bring in the rouble to the basket of currencies," a prominent Hong Kong broker told The Independent. "The Brits are stuck in the middle and will come into the euro. They have no choice because they won''t be able to use the US dollar."\n\nChinese financial sources believe President Barack Obama is too busy fixing the US economy to concentrate on the extraordinary implications of the transition from the dollar in nine years'' time. The current deadline for the currency transition is 2018.\n\nThe US discussed the trend briefly at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh; the Chinese Central Bank governor and other officials have been worrying aloud about the dollar for years. Their problem is that much of their national wealth is tied up in dollar assets.\n\n"These plans will change the face of international financial transactions," one Chinese banker said. "America and Britain must be very worried. You will know how worried by the thunder of denials this news will generate."\n\nIran announced late last month that its foreign currency reserves would henceforth be held in euros rather than dollars. Bankers remember, of course, what happened to the last Middle East oil producer to sell its oil in euros rather than dollars. A few months after Saddam Hussein trumpeted his decision, the Americans and British invaded Iraq.\n\nRelated article: Econoblog: The markets have spoken on the future of the dollar\n\nRead more from the Independent.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------', 0, 1, '110.37.10.112', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2688, 66881),

Now think about the verticle component of velocity of both bullets. imagine they are both fired from a point say, 45degrees to the horizontal... It is common sense then that the heavier slug (here the magnum) will be accelerated more towards the ground due to gravity. Thus meaning that the projectile drops to the ground significantly earlier than the light magnum.

I am not claiming to be the world’s best husband – far from it. But one thing I can attest to is that I am always trying to be better for my lady. I never forget that our relationship is something that needs to grow and change and be worked on. \nIn this post I am going to tell you all the most important things I know about being a good husband, boyfriend or life partner. Some of these I figured out myself, others I learned by trying to do the opposite of what my father did. \n\n[b]The role that always changes[/b]\n\nThe first thing that you need to know if you want to be a good husband is that things change. Your partner changes, you change, your life situation changes. And because these changes take place without warning you constantly need to evolve as a man and as a partner. If you aren’t willing to change who you are (or think you are) then you are going to run into trouble in your relationship.\n\nThat being said, being a good husband is not about bending to your wife’s every whim. Not at all. In fact, she wouldn’t like it if you did that. A good woman will always want you to be true to yourself and to do what makes you happy. But she will expect you to change when change is required, and rightly so. \nThe reason I wrote “become” instead of “be” in the title is because this is a role that is always changing. The job is never finished. The good husband, boyfriend or life partner will always see that there is work to be done on his relationship and his self. Please take this to heart.\n \n[b]How to become a better husband, boyfriend or life partner[/b]\n\nI would like to share some tips with you now in the hope that they will impact your relationship in some positive way. Sadly I have not had that many great male role models in my life so my idea of what a husband should or should not do is something that is constantly changing. If anyone out there knows better than me or has some insight into what a husband really is I would love to read your comments. \n\n[b]1. Learn to listen, but not just to her words[/b]\n\nOne of the best things my life partner has taught me (indirectly) is that a man needs to listen to a woman on many levels, not just her speech. By the time she has to tell you to do something you have often already missed several hints that she has been giving you. If you want to be a good husband you need to learn what these hints are. \nTake the dishes as a really simple example. My mother used to cook dinner ever single night for my father, my brother and me and every single night my father would “forget” to help with the dishes. Now my mother never asked him to help because she knew he was tired from work but she quietly would have loved him to offer his help as thanks for a lovely meal. After dinner she would always be grumpy. On the odd occasion that dad did help with the dishes she would be a different woman; happy engaging and gentle. \nBeing a good husband means listening, not just to her words, but to her more quiet signals. Every woman is different and communicates in different ways and as her best friend it is your job to figure them out.\n \n[b]2. Suggest and create excellent communication habits[/b]\n\nAfter reading the first point you might be thinking, “why can’t she just tell me what she wants?” That is fine. If you have spent a lot of time talking to your wife and creating a relationship where she can openly ask you to do something without feeling like she is nagging then that is excellent. Wait for her to tell you. Mostly, however, your wife will say she shouldn’t HAVE to ask you, you should just do it. This is where communication comes in.\n \nBecoming a good husband means creating excellent communication habits. Sometimes this is hard. Sometimes in the heat of anger you won’t want to communicate. But a good husband tries to. A good husband will find out why you have got to the point of getting angry and create a solution. Let’s look at an example, again borrowed from my father and mother. \nSay you go out on Thursday night with your friends for a beer after work. Your wife is at home cooking dinner and as such it would be nice if you got home by 7.30pm to eat together. But it doesn’t always work out like that and sometimes you don’t get home until late. When you get home you wonder why she is grumpy and you ask her things like, “what’s wrong?” and “did you have a bad day?” which only makes things worse. At the end you give up, yell at her and go to bed. \nNo solution. \n\nA better way to do things is to use your brain and find out what is eating at her. Does it happen every Thursday? Yes. Well then perhaps it has something to do with the beers after work. Okay, now we are getting somewhere. Next you should sit her down on a nice Sunday afternoon and ask her whether you had upset her by being late for dinner. If she says “yes” then apologize and then promise to communicate with her better the next time (i.e. phoning if you are going to be late). Also, gently suggest that she be more open with her feelings because you would never intentionally upset her. \nOpening the communication and creating good communication habits will save your marriage. Be creative. Don’t say “what’s wrong woman” and expect her to tell you and then be cool with it. Take some responsibility and create a solution. If my father did this I imagine their relationship would have worked out a lot differently. This has a lot to do with how much he respected my mother. \n\n[b]3. Don’t lose your sense of individuality[/b]\n\nThis is not something that you ever get told by your parents but it is something that is so important I had to write about it. Don’t lose your sense of individuality. Don’t become one of those couples that merges into one. A marriage is not a melding of two people; it is two individuals coming together. If you lose that individuality you lose something special. \nQuite often I see people get together and then give up their hobbies, past times and interests because they are all absorbed in their partner. Within a few months or years the relationship is over (or in chaos) because they are bored with each other. They gave up their individuality. \nThere is a quote in Buddhism that says, “If you spend enough time with a person you will see only their faults. Even if you were with the Buddha himself you would find something not to like“. This happens in relationships when you give up your individuality and just live as if you were one person. Remember, when you first met each other you had other things going on (reading, sports, music, poetry, friends, etc.) and this is partly why you were attracted to each other. So why give them up? \nSometimes it is hard to keep your hobbies and past times going because work is so full on and you hardly get to see each other but you must try. You must make a concerted effort to spend time apart every week and do something for yourselves. You will be much happier as a couple if you do. \n\n[b]4. Never hit, swear at or yell at your wife[/b]\n\nIt might seem obvious to some people but other people seem to miss the memo. It is never okay to hit, swear at or yell at your wife. If you get to a point where you find that yelling is the only answer then you have made a mistake somewhere along the line and need to go back and fix it up. \n\nSometimes I go out with my mates and talk about our partners and wives. Inevitably one of them will bring up “fights with the missus” and talk about how sometimes you need to yell at your wife to assert your authority. My internal reaction to this is always “no you don’t”. She is not a dog that needs to be trained by showing your dominance. She is your life partner, your best friend and your lover. Hitting, swearing and yelling are forms of degradation and not fit for this person. \nFor all the men out there who think that yelling is necessary I understand where you are coming from. I know the place you are in, I have been there. But I would like to offer you a quote that has stood by me through thick and thin with my lady. This quote was offered to me by my yogi friend when we were discussing marriage back in India.\n\n“The real measure of a man is by how quickly he gets angry.”\nYou will not show your dominance by yelling at your wife. All you will show her is that you have a weak will and a low level of patience. Then man she would really respect is the one that can stand up for himself without resorting to bullying. The real man is one who can keep his calm in battle, sport and love. Please think about this. \n\n[b]5. Show creative leadership[/b]\n\nNow before you start sending me nasty emails, I do not not think that the male is the leader in the relationship. I am well aware that men and women are equals and have always thought this to be the case. One thing I have learned, however, is that your partner will love you all the more (and find you more attractive) when you can show creative leadership in the relationship. Let’s look at an example. \n\nYou have both had a big day, just arrived home and are pretty hungry for dinner. But there is nothing in the pantry. Quite often you will both sit around umming and ahhhing and thinking about what to have. Should we get take away or should be be good and cook? However, instead of sitting around and wondering, a creative leader would make an assertive decision and then get it done. No fuss. No mucking around. Just action. \n\nScientifically speaking women are programmed to like this behavior as it shows strength and survival skills. But more than that is takes away a layer of stress. If you can show some creative leadership when she isn’t feeling at her best she will really appreciate the input. It might be dishes, a conversation over dinner, the color of the new paint or a solution for a problem she is having. Once you start doing this for her you will notice how often she has been doing it for you!\n\n[b]6. Love her, but not just with words[/b]\n\nA big theme in this post is that you must be a husband in more than just words. Words are empty if they are no backed up with meaning and action. The same is true of love. You could tell her that you love her 1000 times a day but it means absolutely zero if you then turn around and ignore her. \nA good husband will find new ways to love his wife. He will listen to her stories, ask her about her day, value her input in the house and in your life and always make sure she feels that appreciation. Tell her how much you admire her actions and who she is becoming as a woman. But don’t do it if you do mean it; make sure the words have meaning. If you can find a way to connect the words with an action that shows you are serious she will love you forever. \n\n[b]7. Don’t beg for sex, create the moment[/b]\n\nA real man will never have sex with his wife when she doesn’t want to. Unfortunately, sex is such a big part of a relationship if problems start to occur the relationship can get a bit rocky. One piece of advice that I can give you is that a good sexual partner creates the circumstances for enjoyable sex, he never asks or begs for it. If she isn’t into it then you need to be patient.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nBeing a good husband, boyfriend or life partner is something that is constantly evolving. You cannot just sit back, do nothing and hope for it all to work out for the best. Try to love her with more than just words, be creative and create some really clear communication habits. And never hit her. Ever.', 0, 1, '124.29.242.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2702, 67249),

"Congratulate the other person for doing such a great job of communicating the idea and tell your boss what a great job this person did of helping bring your idea to life." \n\n[b]3. Ask others for support[/b]\n"Ask others to speak to [your] idea at an anticipated meeting, particularly if you think there might be some pushback," McClarie says. That way, people will refer to the idea as yours. "''Well, (idea-stealer), that''s an interesting point; Charmaine and I were speaking about this last week.'' At that point, the idea has been unstolen." \n\n[b]4. Think beyond the idea[/b]\n"Over a century ago, someone had the idea of turning a horse carriage into an automobile.

Interesting enough, normal walking lets us achieve all three. In fact, walking may be man''s best medicine for slowing the aging process. First, it works almost every muscle in the body, improving circulation to the joints and massaging the blood vessels (keeping them more elastic). Walking also helps us maintain both our muscle mass and metabolism as we age. It also keeps us young in spirit. For anyone out of shape or unathletically inclined, walking is the no-stress, no-sweat answer to lifelong conditioning.\nAll it takes is a little time, common sense and a few guidelines. Unfortunately, there''s a lot of misinformation floating around regarding fitness walking, weight-loss and dieting. Walking is one of the best exercise for strengthening bones, controlling weight, toning the leg muscles, maintaining good posture and improving positive self-concept. People who diet without exercising often get fatter with time. Although your weight may initially drop while dieting, such weight loss consists mostly of water and muscle. When the weight returns, it comes back as fat. To avoid getting fatter over time, increase your metabolism by exercising daily.\n\nTo lose weight, it''s more important to walk for time than speed. Walking at a moderate pace yields longer workouts with less soreness - - leading to more miles and more calories spent on a regular basis.\nHigh-intensity walks on alternate days help condition one''s system. But in a waking, weight-loss program, it''s better to be active every day. This doesn''t require walking an hour every day. The key is leading an active life-style 365 days a year.\nWhen it comes to good health and weight loss, exercise and diet are interrelated. Exercising without maintaining a balanced diet is no more beneficial than dieting while remaining inactive.\n\nThe national research council recommends eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Fruits and vegetables are the ideal diet foods for several reasons. They''re relatively low in fat and calories, yet are often high in fiber and rich in essential vitamins and minerals. Remember that rapid weight-loss consists mostly of water and muscle - - the wrong kind of weight to lose. To avoid this, set more reasonable goals, such as one pound per week.\n\nCarbohydrates are high-octane fuel. They provide energy for movement and help raise internal body metabolism. They''re also satisfying. The key is not adding high-fat toppings to your carbohydrates.\n\nIt''s everyday habits which define our weight and body composition.

We just need to," when the client is trying to keep costs down and avoid an overly ambitious project scope.\n\n[b] Drink the Kool-Aid[/b]  \nDefinition: To enthusiastically perform a task or follow a leader without knowing how this may affect you or to buy the "company line" without question. In business, you may hear someone say, "He drank the Kool-Aid," when  he means, "He has been thoroughly trained in the program and we have his unconditional support," or "He is on board with our strategy." In political commentary, it is used to imply that people who disagree with you have been brainwashed or are under the influence of drugs.\n\n[b] Going native[/b]  \nDefinition: This is what happens when a consultant stops acting like a consultant and starts thinking he is part of the client organization. If you aren''t willing to go somewhere else, go ahead and apply for a permanent job. You aren''t providing the same value you were in the beginning.\n\n[b] Greenfield instance[/b]  \nDefinition: Clean, new installation of an application without customizations, configuration or data. When a brand-new application is installed, it is a "greenfield instance" until the consultants and programmers go in and start messing it up with configurations and code changes.\n\n[b] Holistic[/b]  \nDefinition: A big-picture view or a solution that includes upstream and downstream impacts. Whatever it means, it''s a great consulting word and we use it a lot.\n\n[b] Paradigm[/b]  \nDefinition: The perspective or view you have of a situation. For example, "When ownership of our order fulfillment project moved from operations to sales, it caused a paradigm shift that resulted in a whole new project strategy and approach."\n\n[b] Running in parallel[/b]  \nDefinition: Processing normal operating data through two systems simultaneously to compare performance and output. When a client is feeling particularly paranoid about a new system that his consultants have developed or implemented, even after exhaustive testing and training, we will sometimes recommend running the new system in parallel with the old for a short period.\n\n[b] Straw man[/b] \nDefinition: First draft of a solution or proposal intended to provoke discussion. It is an object, document, person or argument that temporarily stands in for and is intended to be "knocked down" by something more substantial.\n\n[b] Talking to the dog[/b] \n \nDefinition: Thinking it through by talking it through out loud. You''ll often hear engineers and programmers say that they finally solved a problem by talking to the dog.\n\n[b] Use case [/b] \nDefinition: A particular circumstance or situation in which the solution would be used. For example, when designing a system, the engineer will refer to all the use cases that have been documented to determine if his solution would be effective in each situation.\n\n[b] White paper[/b]  \nDefinition: An authoritative report or guide published to share technical or business information, particularly related to solving common problems.

DSA product line is powder coated whereas that monstrosity had enamel paint all over it, enamel paint yar. need I say more?\n6. one of the pieces which they showed us had bent front bead. OK I understand its a prototype but then again some say (apparently not DSA people i''m afraid) that a prototype reflects final product.\n7. it was heavy as a tree trunk, unbalanced, extremely nose heavy and my first thought was WOW! THIS HEAVY WITH SHORT BARREL, CANT IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT WOULD WEIGH WITH A LONGER BARREL.\n8. color cased trigger and bolt on a semi auto: what is that, darra humor?\n\nnow as far actual performance is concerned, I couldnt, simply couldnt. cause I''ve seen far better quality darra made clones.\n\nI''ve talked to Mr. Nooruddin on the phone and as always he is a thorough gentleman and immediately apologized for it. He said that he has been preoccupied with his family lately (the disappearence of his brother Mr. Hakimuddin) and did not give attention to this project.

Maybe go near 100yds.\n\nOr maybe I should instead get myself a .22LR like Abu Al Hawl had planned, which is actually the reason why I bought the Shadow in the first place.

The strike appeared to be a warning to the military that its planned offensive on the insurgents'' stronghold along the Afghan border would be met with attacks against targets across Pakistan.\n\nThe government said the assault on the headquarters, which followed a bloody market bombing and a suicide blast at a U.N. aid agency in the past week, had strengthened its resolve to push into South Waziristan — a mountainous region home to al-Qaida leaders where security forces have been beaten back by insurgents before.\n\nThe spasm of violence was confirmation that the militants had regrouped despite recent military operations against their forces and the killing of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in a CIA drone attack in August. His replacement vowed just last week to step up attacks around the country and repel any push into Waziristan.\n\nArmy spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said "four or five" assailants were holding between 10 and 15 troops hostage in a building close to the main gates of the complex in Rawalpindi, a city near the capital, Islamabad. No senior military or intelligence officials were among those being held, he said.\n\nAbbas said special forces had surrounded the building. "They will decide how and when to act," he said, declining to comment on whether authorities had attempted to talk to the hostage takers or whether they had made any demands.\n\nNo group claimed responsibility, but authorities were sure that the Pakistani Taliban or an allied Islamist militant group were behind it.\n\nLate Saturday, sporadic gunfire was heard coming from the complex.\n\nIn its brazenness and sophistication, the assault resembled attacks in March in the eastern city of Lahore by teams of militants against the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team and a police training center, which the insurgents took over for 12 hours before security forces retook it.\n\nSaturday''s attack began shortly before noon when the gunmen, dressed in camouflage military uniforms and wielding assault rifles and grenades, drove in a white van up to the army compound and opened fire, Abbas and a witness said.\n\n"There was fierce firing, and then there was a blast," said Khan Bahadur, a shuttle van driver who was standing outside the gate of the compound. "Soldiers were running here and there," he said. "The firing continued for about a half-hour. There was smoke everywhere. Then there was a break, and then firing again."\n\nAfter a 45-minute gunfight, four of the attackers were killed, said Abbas.\n\nHe initially told the Geo television news channel that the assault was over and the situation "under full control."\n\nBut more than an hour later, gunshots rang out from the headquarters compound, and Abbas then confirmed that other gunmen had eluded security forces and slipped into the compound. The city is filled with security checkpoints and police roadblocks.\n\n"We are trying to finish it (the siege) at the earliest, clear the area of terrorists and restore complete control," Abbas said.\n\nAbbas said six soldiers were killed, included a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel, and five wounded, one critically.\n\nPakistani media said the Taliban had claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nA police intelligence report in July obtained by the Associated Press on Saturday warned that members of the Taliban along with Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group based in the country''s Punjab province, were planning to attack army headquarters after disguising themselves as soldiers. The report was given to the AP by an official in the home affairs ministry in Punjab''s home department. \n\nOfficials said Saturday they had raided a house in the capital where the attackers were believed to have stayed. They found military uniforms and bomb-making equipment. \n\nThe United States has been pushing Pakistan to take strong action against insurgents using its soil as a base for attacks in Afghanistan. The army has previously been unwilling to go into Waziristan with significant force, but has likely been emboldened by its successes against the militants in the Swat Valley earlier this year and the killing of Baitullah Mehsud. \n\n"I want to give a message to the Taliban that what we did with you in Swat, we will do the same to you there (in Waziristan), too," said Interior Minister Rehman Malik. "We are going to come heavy on you." \n\nMilitants regularly attack army bases across the country and bombed a checkpoint outside the army compound in Rawalpindi two years ago — one of several major bombings to hit the garrison city in recent years. But rarely have the Taliban mounted an armed assault in the city involving multiple fighters. \n\nSaturday''s siege followed a car bombing that killed 49 on Friday in the northwestern city of Peshawar and the bombing of a U.N. aid agency Monday that killed five in Islamabad. The attacks showed the militants are capable of striking a range of targets across the country. \n\nThe man who attacked the U.N. office was also wearing a security forces'' uniform and was granted entry to the compound after asking to use the bathroom. \n\nIslamist militants have been carrying out nearly weekly attacks in Pakistan, but the sheer scale of Friday''s bombing in Peshawar — which killed nine children — pushed the government to declare it would take the fight to the lawless tribal belt along the border where al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden may be hiding. \n\nAny operation in Waziristan will be very difficult. Militants are believed to have 10,000 well-armed fighters there, and winter will arrive in one month''s time and could bog down troops. The army must also ensure that insurgents do not regroup elsewhere in the northwest, including Swat. \n[/quote]', 0, 1, '69.155.117.39', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2729, 68105),

I was joking around with a female friend, and two guys drove up, heard part of the combination and decided to make trouble.  They got out of the car and one pulled a bat.

I was moving so it was galncing blow but it still hurt.  I turned and grabbed the club then I realized I had turned my back on a guy with a bat so I spun the gun around putting him between me and the guy with the bat.  Then punched him knocking him down.

The pistol grip was very comfortable for a person like me having big palms. There were holes for night sights but werent there as this was not the production model......... They told me that two south african engineers were recruited to make this design. They also told me that there pistol underwent test and trial in some foreign country and came out to be successful.

For the home defender, center mass shots will be more than enough. Now, the combat accuracy required for both these cases is quite different. IMHO, the SWAT guy needs quite a bit more accuracy than the civilian, though both are in a state of combat.\n\nIt may have been a pointless rant, but the question, once again, is: how does one define [i]combat accuracy[/i]?[/quote]\n\nKage Fox has asked a great question.\n\nI am not a pro, but I have an opinion/observation.\n\nCombat accuracy used to mean a rifle which fired 4 MOA or less.  For nations fielding an infantry man he need a rifle that would group shots within 4" at 100 yards.  It had nothing to do with the shooters ability, only the rifle''s accuracy.  A sniper rifle had to better 1 MOA for comparison.\n\nHandguns also had a level of acceptable accuracy, which was something like 3" at 25 yrds.  For a rifle the equivilent would be 12 MOA.  Again, this is soley the guns accuracy, nothing to do with the shooter.\n\nHowever, when handgun fighting came into vogue, the term combat accuracy appeared to morph into a something refering to the shooter being able to shoot X number of shots in Y seconds in a group no more than Z inches at A distance.  One writer on a gun blog defined it as 5 shots in 5 seconds in 5 inches at 5 feet.\n\nSome definitions are not quite so precise, such as: "Any hit on the adversary that effects change in the adversary in regards to the OODA loop." Which is how Roger Phillips of Suarez International defined it.\n\nOne large US based shooting school defines it along the line of draw and hit the thorasic cavity with two shots in 1.5 seconds at 5 yards.  I think they define the area as an 8" circle.\n\nI tend to think 5" is too small and 5 seconds too slow when the threat is only 5 feet away.  I also think any shot which makes the threat stop to think a bit too esoteric.  I advocate speed w/o misses over all else.  \n\nA 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper cover''s vital organs on almost every man when held over his upper center cest, portrait like.  If you are hitting that, you are both hurting (likely lethally) and mentally affecting the threat.  The time?  I dunno, as fast as you can?  What distance, no idea either.  \n\nThe biggest problem is that defining combat accuracy as it has morphed into refers to a shooters ability and not the firearms ability and the time demand must be fluid in consort with the distance.  As the distance increases the time requirement must increase.\n\nMaybe the solution is to stop using the term, "combat accuracy" since that officially refers to a inherit mechanical accuracy and coin a more accurate term for a shooters ability to survive a deadly threat.

Note I''ve deliberately excluded the 92fs, knowing well that indeed it is a sharp shooting one.

It is a lesson for all who have contempt / scorn for others. \n \nA NICE ONE !!\nOnce upon a time in China , a girl named Li-Li got married & went to live with her husband and mother-in-law. \nIn a very short time, Li-Li found that she couldn''t get along with her mother-in-law at all. Their personalities were very different, and Li-Li was angered by many of her mother-in-law'' s habits. In addition, she criticized Li-Li constantly. \nDays passed, and weeks passed. Li-Li and her mother-in-law never stopped arguing and fighting. But what made the situation even worse was that, \naccording to ancient Chinese tradition, Li-Li had to bow to her mother-in-law and obey her every wish. All the anger and unhappiness in the house was causing Li-Li''s poor husband great distress.\n\nFinally, Li-Li could not stand her mother-in-law'' s bad temper and dictatorship any longer, and she decided to do something about it. Li-Li went to see her father''s good friend, Mr. Huang, who sold herbs. She told him the situation and asked if he would give her some poison so that she could solve the problem once and for all.\n\nMr. Huang thought for awhile, and finally said, "Li-iL, I will help you solve your problem, but you must listen to me and obey what I tell you."\n\nLi-Li said,"Yes, Mr. Huang, I will do whatever you tell me to do. "Mr. Huang went into the back room, and returned in a few minutes with a package of herbs. He told Li-Li, "You can''t use a quick-acting poison to get rid of your mother-in-law, because that would cause people to become suspicious. Therefore, I have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body. Every other day prepare some delicious meal and put a little of these herbs in her serving. Now, in order to make sure that nobody suspect you, when she dies, you must be very careful to act very friendly towards her. "Don''t argue with her, obey her every wish, and treat her like a queen." Li-Li was so happy. She thanked Mr. Huang and hurried home to start her plot of murdering her mother-in-law. \nWeeks went by, and months went by, and every other day, Li-Li served the specially treated food to her mother-in-law. She remembered what Mr. Huang had said about avoiding suspicion, so she controlled her temper, obeyed her mother-in-law, and treated her like her own mother.\n\nAfter six months had passed, the whole household had changed. Li-Li had practiced controlling her temper so much that she found that she almost \nnever got mad or upset. She hadn''t had an argument with her mother-in-law in six months because she now seemed much kinder and easier to get along with.\n\nThe mother-in-law'' s attitude toward Li-Li changed, and she began to love Li-Li like her own daughter. She kept telling friends and relatives that Li-Li was the best daughter-in- law one could ever find. Li-Li and her mother-in-law were now treating each other like a real mother and daughter. Li-Li''s husband was very happy to see what was happening. \nOne day, Li-Li came to see Mr. Huang and asked for his help again She said, "Dear Mr. Huang, please help me to keep off the poison from killing my mother-in-law. She''s changed into such a nice woman, and I love her like my own mother. I do not want her to die because of the poison I gave her."\n\nMr. Huang smiled and nodded his head. "Li-Li, there''s nothing to worry about. I never gave you any poison. The herbs I gave you were vitamins to\nimprove her health. The only poison was in your mind and your attitude toward her, but that has been all washed away by the love which you gave to her."\n\nHAVE YOU REALIZED that how you treat others is exactly how they will treat you? There is a wise Chinese saying: "The person who loves others will also be loved in return." God might be trying to work in another person''s life through you. \n\nSend this to your friends and spread the POWER OF LOVE.\n\nRemember, if you delete this mail nothing will happen. No one will die or fall sick. But... if you tell this True Story  to others you may change their life. \nAfter all you have got nothing to lose but a lot to gain.

As I told U about my friend working for Glock. I asked him the same question. He replied that Glock''s research there is a good reason for using a plastic guide rod. When the gun is fired the guide rod comes under a great pressure while recycling as the barrel moves a bit to reward while the slide goes all the way back and is pushed back to complete the recycle process on the strength of the guide rod and the spring. In this process the guide rod while being seen on a microscopic video camera indicates that the guide rod almost half bends over. With the passage of time metal fatigue factor can bring more wear & tear. While Plastic guide rod has more flexibility and tendency to bear this recycling stress/fatigue and it performs well under extreme pressure during recycling process.\n\nAs I told my friend that I got after market Steel guide rod with spring and I am intended to u use this instead of Glock Factory plastic guide rod. Don’t do that, he said if u wana use it just for a change then its fine but he recommended me not to do so as Glock has it''s research and if they are not opting for a steel guide rod then there is a reason behind it.

Even in cases of robbery where firearms have been involved by the defender, forensic investigations do follow, and it would not be a pleasant situation whatsoever that they reveal the BG only had a knife, an iron bar or other kind of minor hardware on him and he was shot to death by you!

While with a Gamo Pro Magnum the first shot is all that is required, it is amazing to note that Pro Magnum is as accurate as Match in an air rifle. For indoor use go for Match for outdoor use go for Pro Magnum.

Best would be, if a fresh CERTIFICATION LETTER could be issued to the holder, duly signed by the most senior officer of the department, confirming the genuinty and proper data entries in the record, so that one at least has a proof that on receiving the license one did the effort of going to that relevant dept. for the check.

I will try to answer them by playing the devils advocate. \n\nPersonally I would also like to shoot an intruder but lets look at it closely. Do we think there would be no legal implications for shooting a thief (in Pakistan if you are simply witness to a crime, you are treated as the suspect, unfortunate but true, thus this is more serious case). \n\nWe shoot the thief to death and his lawyer claims that his client robbed 10-20-50-X number of homes and hurt no one. He should have been punished for robbing and not punished by death. \n\nI will aim to answer all your posts to see if we are only ruled by emotion or reason as well. Please also note that my goal is to secure some answers backed by law so that should a situation arise we know that we are protected under the law. \n\nLets start with ay_be_why \n\nThe lawyer’s point of view would really help. Topak are you there? Some have been known to get people scot free. Does any one remember the OJ Simpson case!!!!\n\n@MHMalik\n\nThanks for the information I will search for self/ home defense threads as well.\n\n@Basharat\n\nIn our quest for what to do with a robber I came to know the difference between a ‘choar and dakku’. The first just wants to rob and the second robs with intent to hurt/kill etc. \n\nComing to your comment and only playing the devils advocate. Do you think there will be no repercussions of shooting a thief? (In our relatives case we just found out that 4 houses were robbed and no one was hurt. The thief was there just to get cash and mobiles the common denominator in all 4 houses). So let’s assume that this terrible petty thief who has robbed 3 houses without hurting anyone and now comes to yours and you shoot him. Where do you stand in the court of law? Topak what is your view? \n\nYour suggestion about a guard dog is a good one! Most people who own a gun and are on this forum I assume are not squeamish about using guns. But we should also do the right thing so that we are protected under law. \n\n@AK47\nFirst of all congratulations on becoming the LORD OF WAR. Interesting title. Reminds me of the Last Samurai. I am sure you have seen the movie if not it is a must watch keeping in view the movies theme which revolves around the modernization of weapons, tradition and society in ancient Japan. You have nailed this one. I am interesting in the legal reputations/formalities. The mistake is mine, I should have titled this post ‘Do you shoot and thief and what are our rights under law in all intruder shooting scenarios.” \n\nBy the way I too am not squeamish but would like to do the right thing as a responsible citizen of the country. \n\n@KageFox\n\nI would generally agree with your statement supposing all other things remain constant. \n\n@CougarMan\n\nI would agree with keeping a dog as I personally like them. But there are 2 issues here. Dogs need to be trained only to eat from the master ( and that is an issue if you are a frequent traveler) and not take food from strangers. I lost a dog like this as a kid. Our dog was poisoned. Secondly some people may not be comfortable with a dog in their house due to religious reasons. \n\n@Conceal Carry\n\nNice nick. On a totally different note I have a topic on Smallest guns. If you have any ankle carry suggestions I would love to hear them. \n\nComing to your answer I agree with you that both Islamic and state law allow you to defend your life and our family and loved ones. But the thief who has robbed you and did not hurt you and your family (should he be shot or not) What will the law do here. \n\nI also agree that a thief will carry some sort of weapon lets say a knife but a thief aims to steal and use it only if confronted. His aim is to get money and valuables and leave. Normally he would not like to kill you unless you confront him or if he has a personal grudge with you in which case you have every right to shoot him. Because then you are in your right to shoot him as he has taken the law into his own hands and came with intent to KILL and not to steal. \n\n@KageFox, \n\nAgreed the thief is not there to have tea but he might be there to take cash without harming you unless required/confronted etc. And yes can take him down, in which case a tranquilizer gun comes to mind. But do we shoot him to death?\n\n@Sensei, \nYes if he intends to harm your family we shoot him and we are protected. But in this case we should be able to demonstrate to the court without a shadow of doubt that the intent was to harm your family. Personal vendetta etc. \n\n@A55kika,\nYes but how would the law look at this. Shooting on instincts alone…\n\n@pkjunaidb\nIn one word only INTERESTING. What if you are asleep and robbed and the thief is about to escape without hurting you do you still shoot him to death. In the head and chest thereafter and groan as a member has explained earlier?????\n\nGentlemen, I look forward to your comments and reasons.

Gamo Pro Magnum on the other hand ricochets a bit more but it is LETHAL during hunting for example lizards and rats.

While with a Gamo Pro Magnum the first shot is all that is required, it is amazing to note that Pro Magnum is as accurate as Match in an air rifle. For indoor use go for Match for outdoor use go for Pro Magnum.

Well, according to your post, it seems like license holders have no option, apart from covering themselves up with genuine demand note copies.

(61301, 2079, 60549, 'khakiMB', 1318, '', 1255500423, 'Gentlemen, \n\nWe have made progress since yesterday. We are talking about intent….and thus the plot thickens Dr. Watson!!!\n\nReplies are in order of mails\n\n@Omer571\nFirstly thank you for sharing with us the hadith, I too hope that none of us are ever put in a situation like this. And if we are we should be prepared. \n\nFurthermore you have asked the million dollar question. Do we really know if the intruder is a thief, rapist or a murderer… The honest answer is that we do NOT know. He may well be a thief, or a rapist or a murderer and may also be all of the above. So how do we make that an educated judgment call? I my view the following things come to mind, which are only my opinion and I will let you make your own choice which should be also vetted by Law. Any news from Topak?\n\n1.	If the intruder threatens our life or that of our loved ones he should be shot (if we are in that position).\n2.	If the thief has come to steal and is doing so without waking you up he is mostly only interested in stealing and nothing more that that. (This was the case when the robbers came and stole from our family. \n3.	If the intruder comes in the only thing he does is to wake you up with a life threat than he is most likely the most dangerous kind possibly looking for some revenge. In which case he might not be alone. There may be a few of them… may no one be ever put in that situation. \n\nThese are not the only scenarios and every situation may be different with its set of permutations and combinations. What we can do is to be prepared. My personal aim would be to raise an alarm before such a threatening situation is presented. A good alarm system. Which does not have to be expensive… it could be a \n\n1.	A dog in the house\n2.	Sensors which turn the lights on\n3.	Window and door sensors\n4.	Point of entry in your house should be minimized. Doors which are normally not used should be secured to the best of your ability. \n5.	A very inexpensive system is multiple bells on door knobs. They start clinging as soon as the knob is turned. \n6.	And if the bells or what ever your alarm system rings make sure to fire some shots in the air. If the intruder still tries to break in you know his intent is serious and you might have to take the required action. \n\nPlease remember to lock your doors with multiple locks if possible, in which case the thief will have to break the door, which would clearly show his intent and it will also give you the extra few seconds to arm your self and protect your loved ones. Drills with your family to take them to a secure location in you rooms/house should be rehearsed regularly. If you do not have such a secure location maybe today you may want to think of creating one. The aim is for you to take your family to safety in seconds inside your identified space of your room/house. Secondly in this space you should be protected from fire and it should be a position from were your firing view is unobstructed. In my case it is a walk in closet reinforced by concrete I still have to work on the firing position. Your home construction will also play a role in identifying this space.\n\nThe robbers who came to the family house only went in the rooms which were not locked. Their intent was clear to steal money and cash they were not interested in a confrontation. But I am sure if a confrontation did occur they would have been armed. \n\nGentlemen, one more thing. We are told that if a situation such as this arises on the road and the robbers ask for your car one is advised to give it without a fight. Statistics show that your chances are better to give valuables and cash on the road rather than putting up a fight. Usually road robbers operate in gangs. They come on both driver and passenger sides and have back up which comes in only when required. We are all grown men here you may make your own judgment call. \n\nI could have given this advice in the beginning, but I wanted to know how we all react as a society. Unfortunately the pendulum is tilted towards firing to death, which is what would be required only if the situation calls for it. A thief who is only there to rob and he makes that clear by not disturbing you will attack if he is aggravated. Be safe, be wise and use your guns only when required to protect your family and loved ones. My views may differ from yours and they are only views. They have no legal bearing or otherwise. The only two things which I can tell you with certainty is that I pray for all our safety may you all be safe and in peace. And the second thing I can tell you is that after all this discussion we still don’t know the exact legal /police implications. \n\n@Sohail, \nInteresting grading system\n\n@Zubair 723\nHope we are not in that situation\n\n@Naveed_Pk\nThis is the first time I have seen the X+ system, interesting. \n\n@KageFox, \nThe intruder has no right on your possession or valuables, only you have right over that. The discussion here is to determine if he only steals your valuables what are the legal implications if you shoot him. Only a discussion to determine what the law would do.\n\n@Sensei, \nI am not the authority to tell you what to do, like you I am here to find out what should be done. One thing is suggested above we should all take the necessary precautionary measures to give us time to protect our family.

I don''t know what FP has in mind but an official seminar on gun safety delivered by the Police would focus on key messages such as Not to have one in the pipe to keep safe from ND in any case to actually advising against the use of weapons in the first place.\n\nAs far as actual weapons training is concerned again there are two options:\n\n1. At PNS Karsaz I can talk to the OIC and i think he can arrange a session on basic shooting for members and guests from one of the instructors there. Again this would be basic safety and just basic shooting style and instruction\n\n2. At the Police Elite Training School in Razzakabad again a small session can be arranged but this would perhaps only be a demo for a large group.\n\nFor proper weapons trainibg I doubt that any of the govt organisation Police, PN (Shooting Range, SSGN or Marines), Army etc would accomodate a large group. On an individual basis maybe possible with pvt contacts.\n\nFP, what do you think? Maybe a new topic or an initiaitive undertaken by some of the better connected members.[/quote]\n\nSalams Nazeer bhai, I 100% second your suggestion about getting our members (especially total newbies like me, who have never held a firearm in their life) to take a basic safety course in handling a pistol and basic shooting techniques.\n\nIn fact there was a post which I replied to in this forum about basic training course offered by National Arms in Karachi. This place is located near Agha''s supermarket in Clifton, Karachi. Their training institution is called National Arms academy. Someone suggested that they do Executive training, but the cost is quite steep. About 12-15K for individuals. If you have a group then probably 10K. Anyways, I approached these guys last week and they said they don''t offer any for the time being, but they will contact me later. Gave them my business card, but they were not very enthusiastic and did not give me a price quote right away.\n\nDoes someone know the Chief Executive of National Arms and can arrange a 2-3 day course at reasonable rate for our members (especially total rookies like me)?. If someone can do that, I would like to join.\n\nNazeer, I would love if u could arrange with the OIC at the Karsaz range the basic safety and shooting course. I don''t mind if he also charges a reasonable amount. If you can arrange this, I would be more that greatfull to you bro. Count me in. If something comes up, pls email me at "abbas_exec@yahoo.com.\nThanks bro. I want to keep a firearm for my personal safety, but I want to be well versed practically with firearms particularly PISTOLS.\n\nWhat do u say?.

But there is hope many times the judiciary (when independent) has taken the right decision. In fact in most cases if the Judge is honest and you are fighting a case backed by law the decision will go in your favor. \nI still question if we can shoot someone dead and that is up to us (talking about an intruder entering the house). I believe that motive has to be established. \n\nIf we can establish that the intruder was there to cause bodily harm inclusive of death then we have a case. If however the petty thief whose motive was to steal alone then we may be charged with second degree murder. Remember the burden of proof is on us now. Again this is my observation and it is not backed by law so all lawyers are requested to let us know if this understanding is correct or not. This brings us to how motive is established. (Again my assumption) If the thief is going about the house and he is only stealing whatever he can find without confronting you then he is mostly only interested in stealing. If however the thief is aggressive and makes that known by breaking your door in and threatening your life with death along with your loved ones then we can establish that he was there to harm you and you are justified in killing him. This brings us to the final question the thief was in your house he has taken your valuables without harming you or your family what do you do. Do you shoot him in the leg????

Yeah, the TA+RA22/23/28 are in top 5 muscle cars ever produced by Japanese. Secondly, when it comes with ''Gran Turismo'' edition, that''s what adds a true muscle to that generation :)\n\nLuckily, most of it''s parts were all originals and that''s why I''m restoring it to the most-original state. Parts availability in Pakistan is of course an issue, but Australian market''s quite comfortingly welcoming, so its sort of a non-issue in Red Storm''s case. Yeah, the Blue Devil would have to await a couple of imports, but it''s turn is far away at the moment!\n\nThe stock TA22 weighed 1120KG with engine, transmission and everything in it. That 2T (original/stock) engine was made much of solid steel for those days (35+) years back, alloy wasn''t considered an affordable option in much of the then hot rods. The 1JZ is much light weight as most of it''s parts are made of light weight alloy as it is, yet again, a GT booster ;) A TA22 with a 1JZ and it''s huge turbo and its transmission weight 1040KG i.e. 80KG lesser than the stock! We have an opposite case here. Fortunately, my contractor is not a mechanic, he''s one highly educated pro who thinks tech and talks physics. Of course, it costs me way more than that of typical mechanics, but would definitely pay on track :)\n\nI respect your suggestion but I''m more into muscles and old-school hot rods, KP Starlet wouldn''t be an option for a guy like me for it''s way too non-impressive a ride.\n\nMoreover, a 3SGTE is one small motor too, there''s no comparison to a V6 1JZ GTE VVT-i 24 Valve Dohc Turbo because the 3SGTE and that too it''s latest generation produces 260HP (at 6500RPM: a long long time after stretching the machine closer to the boost-cut limits) stock with the max torque of 310NM that too at the higher RPMs. Whereas a 1JZ GTE VVT-i''s non-tuned/stock motor produces 280HP at lower RPMs which is stretchable upto 700HP while the initial and unstretchable torque being 379NM and that too at 2400RMP! Taken to 700HP (650wheels HP) with just a couple of additions which are cheap to go (incl. traction management), the torque goes to 480-to-550NM at 2400-to-3000RPM. Even the fastest ever edition of Mitsubishi Evolution (Evolution VIII) behaves like a baby-girls before (and much-behind) a 1JZ powered Supra ;) ( [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnf6aGacx8k[/url] )\n\nThat''s the reason I''m putting in 1JZ''s latest generation. You might have given a look at the engine I imported; it''s only 23000km driven and just like brand new, it was ''the best'' engine but of course, earned at a higher bid. But anyway, quality is never cheap too.\n\nPlease don''t take it as I totally disapprove your suggestions. I actually respect when someone as enthusiastic as I am shows a serious concern :)', 0, 1, '115.186.33.250', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2782, 70113),

But my humble advice u have got a fabulous cars project going on that is okay . U r new motor 1jzgte is is 23000 km that sounds like music to my ears . BUt dont believe to much in that 700 bhp figure . We live in pakistan and they way to go is fast.but reliable . 700 bhp with stock internals is stretching the envelope to the limit . NOw the goras do that coz they have standalone fuels managment system , Fully programmable ecU, a higher octane fuel .and last but not the least they have professional turbo specialists to tune their cars on a rolling road . See on a turbo charged application more power means u have to turn on the boost .NOe as long as u dont go more then 20 to 30 % of incremental boost it is fine > Probably then u will need a a fuel cut defender. But from then onwards the problem really grow exponentially . See ur stock turbo charger is not that efficent coa toyota didnt want it to be that way . The turbo has it efficent range within which it operates . when u wind up the boost it starts overreving and as a result starts to transfer heat into the the compressor side . as result u r intake temperature starts to rise . U r  stock intercooler will not cool the intake charge so either u go for a bigger intercooler or a desi tareeka water spray on it . But for 650 at the wheels with stock internals woosh i guess Formula one tech staff might manage it with 3 to 4 on board computers . For us mortals to have a reliable 650 bhp 1jzgte u have to spend alot more on the engine the the engine itself , computers , intercooler piping . throttle body . a biger turbo charger and the list goes on . So Brother i dont know the mechanic u have hired . But generally they quote out of this world figure of BHP . hey brother i guess i proving to be a pain in the neck for u appologies for that .:lol:.

Its when you mix the two and come to the center dividing line where things always get messy.  Over all things are really messy and greyish when it comes to guns in US.  Its one of the top agendas during elections following abortion.  Most of the gun control laws are passed by the Handgun Control Inc. headed up by Sarah Brady (Brady Bill), She is the wife of one of the staff members of Ronald Reagan.  When Ronald Reagan was shot, her husband was shot in the head during the attack, although he has survived, talks and barely walks, his wife went made it a mission in life to go after gun owners no matter how.  She succeeds whenever there is a Democratic Pres. and fails when a Rep. President is elected.  The High Capacity PERMANENT Ban Bill is currently in the house awaiting passage.  More than likely it will pass into law and all highcapacity mags will be banned in the US forever.  Hence the buying frenzy in the US.  And although one has the right to keep and bear arms in the US.  There are many ways around this to control guns.  One of the oldest has been the NFA whereby PB weapons are taxed and then issued a stamp.  The BATF simply refuses to issue the stamp and hence you can''t own that weapon because its illegal.  Title 18 USC is a very picky penal code.\n\nIn Canada, also a gun loving country which up until 2002 didn''t require a license or permits for guns - took a dive into the deep end of gun control mainly due to biker gang violence coming from across the border from US.  They first had an amnesty law in which all firearms PB and NPB were registered.  Then they basically issue you an id which can be had when you enroll in a gun club, take firearms courses, and pass.  You are then issued a PAL upon which you can then go about purchasing weapons.  They have computerized their system and are very quick in processing.\n\nIn Switerzerland... Well what can I say, been there several times... hmmm its a gun lovers paradise.  Its the ONLY country in the world that has the most lenient gun laws and its people/government promote gun ownership.  They even have a week during every year when they all come out and walk around parading with various weapons.

In 1982, Kennesaw Georgia passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in their home, exempting those with criminal records or religious objections. Yet, after the law went into effect in 1982, there have been only three murders: two with knives (1984 and 1987) and one with a firearm (1997).Seven months after it took effect, the residential burglary rate dropped 89%, vs. 10.4% statewide. Crime against persons plummeted 74 percent compared to 1981, and fell another 45 percent in 1983 compared to 1982. And it has stayed impressively low. \nIn addition to nearly non-existent homicide, the annual number of armed robberies, residential burglaries, commercial burglaries, and rapes have averaged, respectively, 1.69, 31.63, 19.75, and 2.00 through 1998. \n\nWith all the attention that has been heaped upon the lawful possession of firearms lately, you would think that a city that requires gun ownership would be the center of a media feeding frenzy.

Kennesaw proves that the presence of firearms actually improves safety and security. This is not the message that the media want us to hear. They want us to believe that guns are evil and are the cause of violence. The facts tell a different story. \n\nWhat is even more interesting about Kennesaw is that the city''s crime rate decreased with the simple knowledge that the entire community was armed.

Halbrook\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Europe June 4, 1999\n\nIn 1994, when the U.S. Congress debated whether to ban "assault weapons," a talk show host asked then-Senator Bill Bradley (New Jersey), a sponsor of the ban, whether guns cause crime. The host noted that, in Switzerland, all males are issued assault rifles for militia service and keep them at home, yet little crime exists there. Sen. Bradley responded that the Swiss "are pretty dull." \n\nFor those who think that target shooting is more fun than golf, however, Switzerland is anything but "dull." By car or train, you see shooting ranges everywhere, but few golf courses. If there is a Schuetzenfest (shooting festival) in town, you will find rifles slung on hat racks in restaurants, and you will encounter men and women, old and young, walking, biking and taking the tram with rifles over their shoulders, to and from the range. They stroll right past the police station and no one bats an eye. (Try this in the U.S., and a SWAT Team might do you in.) \n\nTourists-especially those from Japan, where guns are banned to all but the police-think it''s a revolution. But shooting is the national sport, and the backbone of the national defense as well. More per capita firepower exists in Switzerland than in any other place in the world, yet it is one of the safest places to be. \n\nAccording to the U.N. International Study on Firearm Regulation, England''s 1994 homicide rate was 1.4 (9% involving firearms), and the robbery rate 116, per 100,000 population. In the United States, the homicide rate was 9.0 (70% involving firearms), and the robbery rate 234, per 100,000. England has strict gun control laws, ergo, the homicide rate is lower than in the U.S. However, such comparisons can be dangerous: In 1900, when England had no gun controls, the homicide rate was only 1.0 per 100,000. \n\nMoreover, using data through 1996, the U.S. Department of Justice study "Crime and Justice" concluded that in England the robbery rate was 1.4 times higher, the assault rate was 2.3 times higher, and the burglary rate was 1.7 times higher than in the U.S. This suggests that lawfully armed citizens in the U.S. deter such crimes. Only the murder and rape rates in the U.S. were higher than in England. The small number of violent predators who commit most of these crimes in the U.S. have little trouble arming themselves unlawfully. \n\nThe U.N. study omits mention of Switzerland, which is awash in guns and has substantially lower murder and robbery rates than England, where most guns are banned. \n\nHere are the figures: The Swiss Federal Police Office reports that in 1997 there were 87 intentional homicides and 102 attempted homicides in the entire country. Some 91 of these 189 murders and attempts involved firearms. With its population of seven million (including 1.2 million foreigners), Switzerland had a homicide rate of 1.2 per 100,000. There were 2,498 robberies (and attempted robberies), of which 546 involved firearms, resulting in a robbery rate of 36 per 100,000. Almost half of these crimes were committed by non-resident foreigners, whom locals call "criminal tourists." \n\nSometimes, the data sound too good to be true. In 1993, not a single armed robbery was reported in Geneva. \n\nNo one seems to be looking at the Swiss example in the U.S., however. Congress is stampeding to pass additional firearm restrictions in response to the events of April 20, when two students used guns and bombs to murder a dozen classmates and a teacher in Littleton, Colorado. Yet in 1996, a man who legally owned guns under England''s strict regulations went on a rampage, murdering 16 children and a teacher in Dunblane, Scotland. Parliament then banned all handguns and most rifles. \n\nBut there have been no school massacres in Switzerland, where guns and kids mix freely. At shooting matches, bicycles aplenty are parked outside. Inside the firing shelter, the competitors pay 12-year-olds tips to keep score. The 16-year-olds shoot rifles with men and women of all ages. In fact, the tourist brochure "Zurich News" recommends September''s Knabenschiessen (boy''s shooting contest) as a must-see: "The oldest Zurich tradition . . . consists of a shooting contest at the Albisguetli (range) for 12 to 16 year-old boys and girls and a colorful three-day fun-fair." The event has been held since 1657, and attracts thousands of teenage participants and spectators. \n\nWhile many shoot for sport, all males aged 20 to 42 are required by militia system regulation to keep rifles and/or pistols at home. In addition, gun shops abound. Yet firearms are rarely used in crime. Homicide is tied to a willingness to resort to violence, not the mere presence of guns. The prevalence of firearms in the home and the participation of youth in shooting matches bind youth to adults and discourages a generation gap. \n\nBy contrast, homicide rates are highest in the underdeveloped countries, many of which ban private firearm possession. In some, private murder does not compare to the genocidal murder committed by governments against their unarmed subjects. \n\nIn America, firearms take on a sinister reputation from the nightly news and violent movies. But in Switzerland, firearms symbolize a wholesome, community activity. The typical weekend shooting festival brings out the entire family. Beside the range is a huge tent where scores or hundreds of people are eating, drinking, and socializing. \n\nWith cantonal and rifle club banners fluttering in the wind, the melody of rifle fire blends with Alpine music and cow bells. Since its founding in 1291, Switzerland has depended on an armed populace for its defense. William Tell used a crossbow not only to shoot the apple from his son''s head, but also to kill the tyrant Gessler. For centuries, the cantonal republic defeated the powerful armies of the European monarchs. Machiavelli wrote in 1532: "The Swiss are well armed and enjoy great freedom." \n\nThis coincidence has not escaped the notice of those who oppose liberty. \n\nMonarchist philosopher Jean Bodin, writing in 1606, denounced free speech and arms possession by commoners. Subjects must be disarmed to prevent democratic sedition, he said. The Swiss proved, Bodin wrongly averred, that arms bearing was "the cause of an infinite number of murders." \n\nThe Swiss militia model, however, preserved democracy and held Europe''s despots at bay. In fact, it inspired the rebellious American colonists. John Adams praised the democratic Swiss Cantons, where every man was entitled to vote on laws and to bear arms. Patrick Henry, another American Founding Father, lauded the Swiss for maintaining their independence without "a mighty and splendid President" or a standing army. \n\nThe Swiss influence is clear in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Today, it has become fashionable to hate this orphan of the Bill of Rights. \n\nHowever, a quick glance at history shows that tyrannical governments kill far more than do private criminals. But first, governments must disarm their victims. In 1933, the Nazis seized power via massive search-and-seizure operations for firearms against "Communists," i.e., all political opponents. In 1938, during the Night of the Broken Glass, they disarmed the Jews. When the Nazis occupied Europe in 1939-41, they proclaimed the death penalty for any person who failed to surrender all firearms within 24 hours. \n\nThere may be various reasons why the Nazis did not invade Switzerland, but one of those reasons is that every Swiss man had a rifle at home. For this we have no better record than the Nazi invasion plans, which stated that, because of the Swiss shooting skills, Switzerland would be difficult to conquer and pacify. European countries occupied by the Nazis had strict gun controls before the war, and the registration lists facilitated confiscation of firearms and the execution of their owners. \n\nBy being able to keep out of both world wars in part through the dissuasive factor of an armed populace, Switzerland demonstrates that civilian firearm possession may prevent large numbers of deaths and even genocide. The Holocaust never came to Switzerland, the Jewish population of which was armed just like their fellow citizens. In the rest of Europe, what if there had been not just one, but two, three, or many Warsaw Ghetto Uprisings? \n\nTraditionally, the Swiss Cantons had few firearm regulations. The first federal firearms law was recently enacted. Certain firearm purchases require a permit, and others do not. On retirement, every soldier may keep his rifle or pistol. Surplus assault rifles may be purchased by any Swiss citizen from the Military Department. \n\nThe bottom line is one of attitude. Populations with training in civic virtue, though armed, do not experience sensational massacres or high crime rates. Indeed, armed citizens deter crime. Switzerland fits this mold. Similarly, America''s lawful "gun culture" is peaceful. Sadly, some of its subcultures are not.', 0, 1, '58.65.157.94', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 214, 70419),

I meant that such a precious weapon which is beautifully engraved can be afforded by only a very wealthy individual. And if it is given as a gift to somebody (who other wise can not afford it) he will more often than not sell it as was done by the General (without even firing a single bullet - probably for the fear of its value depreciation) and the next party as well (who so ever it is) also wants to sell it for a handsome price.

The aforementioned three Taurus pistols have a proven reliability record, and will be more than enough. Other options include the Stoeger Cougar, the Baikal Viking and the CZ999.

Young blood has a tendency to carry them and then talking of CC, implying smaller weapons with less power, aiming to do what? What are you up to? Brother you are not in law protection where you come across BG quite frequently and you carry a bigger gun with a smaller CC as back up. Remember, only use the weapon as a last resort. Your life is more important than any other worldly thing, honour not withstanding. If you are mugged on gun point don,t do any silly move unless you are sure that you have a chance. The guy mugging you is more jittery and under pressure than what you are. He can pull the trigger on any unexpected move on your part as he feels endangered. HD is a separate issue where you are in your house and have an early warning of intruders with time, house protection and awareness on your side. This may not happen on road once you are vulnerable and surprised. Remember, once a weapon is drawn there is no turning back. So be sure of your weapon, your capabilities and wait for appropriate time. Don,t be emotional and my humble opinion is don,t carry the weapon. Keep it at your place.

As is obvious, 9mm ammo is quite cheaper, compared to the .45 ACP. More experienced members can give you an idea of cost difference per round. \n\nWith that out of the way, you have two options if you want a Taurus in .45. The 1911 Dr Zakir mentioned is a very good option, very popular among 1911 aficionados these days. There''s also the 24/7 in .45, which is reported to perform better in .45 than in 9mm. \n\nIf you decide that .45 is not for you and wish to go for a 9mm for home defence and range work, your best bet would be the Taurus PT99 (adjustable sights), though other options are PT92 & PT917 (fixed sights). If you are into concealed carry, you could also consider the Taurus PT909. The Taurus 24/7 in 9mm is known to have reliability issues with more than a few members. Last, but not least, you could look around for the Taurus PT809.

Its like Russian Belarus (nick named Roosi) tractor. Its big & ugly but the monster is strong enough in its hydraulics that it can jack itself up unlike any other in the market.\n\n[b]Weight[/b] Feels & it is slightly heavier than synthetic finished O/Us. Its taken as an advantage to absorb a portion of kick that cumulates to mild bruises after a days shoot without a padded jacket.\n\n[b]Finish[/b] Not a refined or finely finished gun in any way. I was looking for something that I could refer to as ''delicate'' or ''flimsy'' but couldn''t find any. Parts of the gun look like as if they are made for a battlefield rather than casual sports shooting. Thick & solid. It takes more effort to breech open the gun than to open the main gate of my house.

All posts are being answered in order of appearance since my last post. \n\n@psychiatrist-1\nI concur. And I am with you on almost everything you say. Moving forward we still need to establish what the law has to say. \n\n@StevenCline, \n\nThank you for defining the difference between burglary, theft, robbery (aggravated robbery). I am not sure if Texas also follows a variant of common law, if Texas was a state in Pakistan you would have answered some of my questions. By the way when I visited Texas it reminded me of home (Peshawar). There is a very strong gun culture there. Another similar habit was the love for red meat, I have yet to have a bigger stake. \n\nAnd yes Basharat is the only one who has come close to defining the law, questions of motive, intent, and in your terms can we shoot a burglar, thief or robber here in Pakistan? Burden of proof issues? A new member and a professor of law has joined. He might be able to give a detailed explanation of intruder entry. The night day shooting is also interesting. Thank you and Basharat for your contribution to the thread. However the law here is a bit more complicated that is why we are still discussing it and everyone has their own interpretation of the law. I wish it was black and white and we have ended the discussion much earlier. \n\n@Enigmatic Desires, \n\nThe system of justice is what we also need to develop so that we can also reap the benefits of a good system in our own country. Unfortunately we are party to the systems failures; in this case we can not blame it entirely on the system. But I would not mind living in Texas for a few weeks every year. ?\n\n@Zubair723 and Omer 571\n\nUnfortunate but true. And when it comes to our homes we take other decisions. I pray for all your safety at the commercial markets. I wish we stood strong along side the brave and no one would be able to threaten them. \n\n@KageFox, \nIndeed the system works well in Saudi Arabia. They used to leave their shops open during prayers. Strong law is a powerful deterrent\n\n@Zubair723, \n\nSmart comment.

In Karachi for instance, there are people whom indulge in this stupidity at Eid, when Pakistan wins a cricket match, on weddings, 14 august, birthdays, public shows of power and an uncountable number of other occasions.\n\n Truth be told, there is no fun in firing in the air, and still if someone feels that the cannot help themselves (which is very very sad) they should at least use blanks. It goes without saying that the man in the incident is subject to extreme stupidity which resulted in probable loss of his life, however, we need to take a moment to think about where all of those bullets fell. Numerous people could have died due to bullets "from unknown directions" coming and hitting them. This guy was lucky to have people know that he was brutally murdered, others may not have that privilege. This tragedy comes around due to a complete and absolute disregard of responsibility; Education comes much later on. Knowing not to fire bullets in the air is common sense. Something that these people lack greatly.\n\nPeople stand up today and say that these people were stupid. You are all right! But sadly, at the end of the day, some of us turn around and do the same things over again, whether it be in public gatherings or within the vicinity of our homes. I just pray for the day that people like this will get some kind of a grasp on how to be responsible and be a better citizen of our beloved Pakistan. \n\nAstughfirullah', 0, 1, '119.155.11.197', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2744, 70837),

Darra I would like to remind you all IS a welcoming place for those who want to do business only.  If a person wants drugs, women, get someone killed or kidnapped, AND hide from the law... then this is the WRONG PLACE to be.

When one visits one keeps their political and religious views to themselves.  Stick to business - look at guns, guns (with nec. documentation), eat tikkas and leave.  \n  \nIf one has ALL legal license(s) like me (I always travel with my license(s) and/or DEPO issued NOC) and visits there for the purpose of LEGAL purchase, there is no problem.', 0, 1, '203.99.48.111', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2815, 70891),

Beretta have not yet published anything yet, but from what I have read, their new autoloader shotgun, Xplor UNICO A400, it is a refinement of the Beretta Xtrema 2 and 391.[/i]\n\n[i] \nBeretta Xplor - It is Green!\nOver the weekend I was searching for photos of the new shotgun, and even emailed my contact at Beretta USA, but all I could find was some pretty boring images taken by Beretta showing it being shot from a distance. For some reason Beretta made all the journalists who attended the launch to agree not to publish any photos before November. I believe the photo above is legit. An Italian online store published it, only to take it down soon after (presumably after realizing they were not allowed to publish it). I have blurred out their name so that they do not get into any trouble.[/i]\n\n[i]Onto the shotgun itself ...[/i]\n\n[i]The shotgun will come chambered in a 3" version and 3.5" super-magnum version. It optionally features the new kick-off^3 (that is kick-off-cubed, for those of you who do not use spreadsheets) recoil reduction system stock. Two hydraulic dampers in the stock (the return spring is forward of the receiver, not in the stock) and another damper, maybe mercury or a spring mechanism, in the forend.[/i]\n\n[i]Jim Shepherd reports:[/i]\n\n[i]With our barrels plugged for only three shots, I didn''t get to try the four-shot speed, but I did empty my three shots at a rate I didn''t think possible-and aimed, not simply fired. That''s apparently due the test gun''s using Beretta''s new "Kick-Off" recoil reduction system. Along with a new Micro Core recoil pad, dual hydraulic dampers in the butt and a third to reduce recoil peak from the bit of the bolt against the receiver, it absolutely reduced the impact of a long day''s shooting.[/i]\n\n[i]Maybe the first recoil damper is inserted into the magazine, which would explain why they were not allowed more than three rounds loaded into the magazine? I don''t really know, I am guessing.[/i]\n\n[i]It uses a new gas system called the Beretta BLink. The name is a reference to its speed. Weighing in at 6.6 lbs, it is very light and slightly lighter than the Benelli Vinic.[/i]\n\n[i]James Marchington, of Sporting Shooter magazine (UK), published a scan of the specifications ...[/i]\n\n[i]Specifications	\nGauge	12 gauge\nChamber	3" or 3.5" (both will shorter cartridges)\nCapacity	Unknows\nReceiver	Aluminum\nFinish	Adonized color.

We used the Piranha in Islamabad before the GTG for around a 100 rounds and I did not clean it purposely, shot about 100 plus rounds again though it yesterday for a total of 200 + without any cleaning what so ever and am happy to report that not a single FTF occurred. The Piranha compact was also fired for about 100 rounds and has the same reliability report. \n\nThe Piranha is a fantastic gun, the grips are nice, sights marvelous and the recoil and the balance very decent. The trigger although OEM could be mistaken for custom and pull is very crisp at around 3.5 pounds. The accuracy report you will see below. I would rate it *ideal* for range use and can and will pull it''s own weight against pistols 10 times it''s price in all categories. If I was a competition shooter I would prefer this over anything else I own.\n\nThe Piranha Compact is a very good gun as well. Frankly I think I should not have been testing a full frame pistol vs a compact on the same day but it still did not disappoint. For it''s size it''s great shooter. My piece was shooting a bit low, I thought it was me perhaps but I had more experienced shooters try with the same result. The recoil however was much more noticeable when firing against a full frame pistol, it will take most shooters off guard on the first few shots. The sound is very pleasant, unlike the Stoeger which to me sounds like a .30 TT. The combat grips make the pistol great to hold and will make sure the pistol will stay firmly in your hand in all situations.

[/quote]\n\nPlease remember that my definitions are based on US law and Texas in particular.  They may not be the definitions in Pakistan.\n\n[quote]I am not sure if Texas also follows a variant of common law, if Texas was a state in Pakistan you would have answered some of my questions. By the way when I visited Texas it reminded me of home (Peshawar). There is a very strong gun culture there. Another similar habit was the love for red meat, I have yet to have a bigger stake. [/quote]\n\nYes, meat is good, big thick steaks even better!\n\n[quote]And yes Basharat is the only one who has come close to defining the law, questions of motive, intent, and in your terms can we shoot a burglar, thief or robber here in Pakistan? [/quote]\n\nPlease remember and consider well that I am NOT a lawyer, I am only opining on the clearly written statutes:\n\n[u][b]Concerning shooting a burglar[/b][/u] (someone who forcibly enters a habitation to commit a theft or other crime).  Then this part of Pakistan appears to give lawful justification to use deadly force:\n\n[quote]103.    "When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death:\nThe right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in Section 99, to the voluntary Causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:-\n\nSecondly:     House-breaking by night;\n\nFourthly:     Theft, mischief or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not exercised."\n[/quote]\n\n103 "Secondly" appears to me to say, if a person breaks into your home at night you are justified in using deadly force against him.  If I were in Pakistan and someone forced open a door or window at night and entered my home, I would shoot them.\n\n103 "Fourthly" may also give me justification to use deadly force (shoot) if there were other circumstances which reasonably cause me fear I would be killed or very badily hurt if I didn''t use shoot the housebreaker.  One possible example may be the house-trespasser who is much larger than me and does not flee my home when caught, or even advances on me.  Or is closing on a sword hanging on the wall or the gun safe.  If he gets to the sword or guns I would be in a lot of trouble.\n\n[u][b]Concerning "theft" or shooting a thief.[/b][/u]  I am presumming the definition of theft is simply taking from someone without permission.  I saw nothing in the 103 part of the law that which would jsutify shooting a thief.  If someone in Pakistan were to take my bicycle and ride off on it, I would not use deadly force (shoot) the thief to stop the crime he committing or stop the theft of my bicycle.\n\n[u][b]Concerning shooting a robber:[/b][/u]  The 103 law is also very clear, it says\n\n[quote]103.    "When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death:\nThe right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in Section 99, to the voluntary Causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:-\nFirst:     Robbery;[/quote]\n\nThe only question is how is "Robbery" defined by Pakistan''s law?  If you intend to justify shooting a person under the provision of stopping a robbery, then you would be very wise to know what a robbery is in Pakistan.  You would not want to be wrong in believing an act is robbery when it is not.\n\nJust to share, in the US, Robbery is often defined a crime against a person, not a crime against property.  This because the criminal is threatening a person in order to steal from him.  Deadly force is justified most often because of the threat directed at the person, not because the robber is taking property.\n\nOften times a person is justified in using deadly force to stop a robbery not because a robbery was being committed but because the robber was threatening a person with a knife or a gun to get the property.  The threat with a knife or gun (or bat or brick or bottle) is what made deadly force justified.\n\n[quote]Burden of proof issues? [/quote]\n\nGreat question- I don''t know.  A lawyer should definately be sought on this question.  In some US States the Prosecutor has the burden to prove that a burglar WAS NOT being committed, or a robbery was not being committed, while in others the person claiming justification/self-defense has the burden of proving he was being robbed or his home was being broken into at night. (How is, "night" defined by Pakistan law?)\n\n[quote]A new member and a professor of law has joined. He might be able to give a detailed explanation of intruder entry. The night day shooting is also interesting. Thank you and Basharat for your contribution to the thread. However the law here is a bit more complicated that is why we are still discussing it and everyone has their own interpretation of the law. I wish it was black and white and we have ended the discussion much earlier.

I have never shot STI, kimber but shot Sig 220, 226. All the sigs are accurate but are less natural pointing guns than glock with more muzzle flip. so quick accurate repeat shot has to be mastered. The most important thing in a self defence handgun is the gun relaiability which matters first and accuracy comes second. Glock is utterly reliable haveing natural pointability. I shot both HK & Glock many times and found that in quick reflex shooting, glock is a winner. HK vs Glock (9mm) with respect to price i suggest glock is the choice. I rather like HK .45 USP, though i have shot HK MARK 23 (potentialy accurate) because of the relatively thinner grip from the Glock 21, HK .45 USP feels and shoot better.

I have personally verified it from dealers and seen different batches of it to give this statement. Every different batch of POF ammo coming out is of different color and quality. Case buldges are much likely to be observed in every 1 outa 5 round. Wherether you believe it or not! I would recommend to do a marketing research on it. What we are calling as fake POF is.. actually the original POF.\n\nstandard, +p and +p+ are well explained with regards to SAAMI specs.. Only +p+ is all commercial american thing if you are really into it. Standard 9mm is around 37,400psi on average which ranges as much as to 42000psi under SAAMI SPECS which marks it +p then BUT still under limit of its spec.  +p+ even further exceeds it. +p+ are actually commercial terms vastly used to market ammunition to power crazy people who want to add more power type of chronic thingy going on in their minds and to raise their curosity by classifying it to only L.E. 9mm is already a very high pressure round and a non-magnum caliber. Its case capacity has already took it to its limits. So only slight can be done and played with it. The term PROOF LOAD is known term in this regards. This type of ammo is used to proof test barrels chambers and firearm functioning limits and to testify its strength. Proof load by SAAMI spec is 49000psi approx. Many of these +p+ marketers exceed the pressure, bordering somewhere near to proof loadings. +p+ from different manufacturers under their different ammunition brands do not set a scale by which you could compare these. Some may define  +p+ as 43000psi and on an other brand of ammo from same company may mark +p+ at 47k psi. Its by all means a commercial hoopla.\n\nAs skeeter sb mentioned some pistols on their performance regarding +p+ consumption. Nearly each and every firearm maker advertise its weapon to stay within the SAAMI SPEC of which the max is +p (42000psi). Any weapon beyond that would wear or function erratically. Glock are no exception. \nyou can check it on glock world - [url]http://www.glockworld.com/content.aspx?Ckey=gwa_9mm[/url]\n\n[quote]POF advertises its mkII at 1110 or 1115 or so fps. Which by all means does not take it much to a high powered 9mm. Its a standard round as per their disclosed statistics. unlike US M882 ball 9mm ammo which is a high powered 9mm and stays competent with several commercially so called +p+ ammo reaching up to 1230fps. This round is being fired all day long from M92 today in military trainings and shootouts(left aside the XM9 trial days where 92s malfunctioned on low count rounds due to faulty slides and Marine using them extensively with Proof Loads exceeding 50,000psi) These stories are availble on the internet anyway. [/quote]\nI appologize for above information, actually i mixed up p1Z with p2Z ammo in POF 9mm brand. p2Z is infact rated on 1290+ fps and is obviously +p or even +p+. No doubt its the most powerful 9mm ammo available in Pakistan pricewise. Its more powerful than chinese norinco, russian wolf brand and american eagle ammo. \n\n[quote]@Skeeter60 Sir if you could please chronograph MkII loading for us Pakguns? and also weigh the supposedly 115grain loadings to proove against the data they have provided on their website? and also please confirm the availability of MKI. Have they merged both standard pistol and subgun ammo as one?[/quote]\nSkeeter sb are actually right.

One of the USPs is with a dealer and you are more than welcome to inspect corrosion on the slide, slide release and other nooks and crannies.\n\nSigs (recent models, older models had a k-kote finish) & HKs have a nitron finish on them making them rust resistant and not rust proof. Glock on the other hand comes with a tennifer finish. Teflon and tennifer are known to penetrate into metals giving them more strength and durability making their extrior rust proof. Tennifer again doesnt wear out that easily as compared to nitron or parkerization. In Pakistan these pistols come at such a high price most of us treat them as their children. Even the ones who carry regularly carefully take them out of the box , tuck them in a nice holster come back home and put them back into a box.

AND....... do our PG hunters recommend this gun as someone''s first hunting gun?[/b][/quote]\nWell i have no experience with bolt actions but have accompanied friends to buy them so i have an idea regarding the costs and brands available. If you consider bolt actions, there are very few bolt actions available in the resonable price range and are mostly available in .243 and 7mm. The most preferred is 7mm but have no clue why. There are 3 brands in the reasonable price range that i know of they being Parker Hale (Local assembled by GM Dosul but Barrel and Bolt are imported), BSA England (Local assembled by GM Dosul but Barrel and Bolt are imported) and the CZ Brno. \nPrices are as follows:\nParker Hale 7mm - 26k\nBSA England 7mm - 28k\nCZ Brno 7mm or .243 - 50k\nI have no idea about other brands but if you are considering a bolt action in the 100k range then the best bet you have is the CZ Brno considering its price, finishing and reliability. There are absolutely no issues with the Parker Hale and BSA, they are good for starters and are very good low budget rifles. The only problem that i came to know of, was that it is very difficult to put on a scope on them. The CZ on the other hand is a complete package. The ammo for 7mm costs around 185-200rs. per piece. I have no clue about the Grains for this bullet but the brand is Winchester, for ammo. Our member Sohail bhai has bought a CZ Brno and our member Moin bhai bought a Parker Hale or BSA.

Info regarding NIB as well as used will be appreciated.[/color][/b]\n\n[b]Moreover, from some old posts by our hunters, I picked up that new Parker-Hale 7mm (GM Dosul Pakistan assembled) are available in KHI, LHR and ISB in the range of 30k - 35k. My question is, has anyone recently seen one of these PHs in KHI...... AND....... do our PG hunters recommend this gun as someone''s first hunting gun?[/b][/quote]\nWell i have no experience with bolt actions but have accompanied friends to buy them so i have an idea regarding the costs and brands available. If you consider bolt actions, there are very few bolt actions available in the resonable price range and are mostly available in .243 and 7mm. The most preferred is 7mm but have no clue why. There are 3 brands in the reasonable price range that i know of they being Parker Hale (Local assembled by GM Dosul but Barrel and Bolt are imported), BSA England (Local assembled by GM Dosul but Barrel and Bolt are imported) and the CZ Brno. \nPrices are as follows:\nParker Hale 7mm - 26k\nBSA England 7mm - 28k\nCZ Brno 7mm or .243 - 50k\nI have no idea about other brands but if you are considering a bolt action in the 100k range then the best bet you have is the CZ Brno considering its price, finishing and reliability. There are absolutely no issues with the Parker Hale and BSA, they are good for starters and are very good low budget rifles. The only problem that i came to know of, was that it is very difficult to put on a scope on them. The CZ on the other hand is a complete package. The ammo for 7mm costs around 185-200rs. per piece. I have no clue about the Grains for this bullet but the brand is Winchester, for ammo. Our member Sohail bhai has bought a CZ Brno and our member Moin bhai bought a Parker Hale or BSA. So they would be the best people to get a complete insight about these rifle''s.[/quote]\n\nThank you for the market sample.', 0, 1, '115.186.108.32', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2836, 71959),

Hence it is no surprise that politicians, the affluent and other elites in Karachi are moving about the metropolis with heavily armed guards in plain clothes.\n\nSome of these gunmen are armed with sophisticated weapons that do not belong to the city streets. What is perhaps more disturbing is that the city’s police force appears to be reluctant to confront these individuals. The display of even licensed weapons by persons in plain clothes is not allowed under the law, unless approved by the home ministry. Yet such permission is generally not thought necessary as policemen do not want to risk ‘offending’ the person being guarded. No one is above the law and when the country’s precarious security situation is considered, no one should feel offended when asked to provide identification or legal documents, especially keeping in mind the lethal weapons in question.\n\nNevertheless, the need for armed guards for politicians and public figures who need extra security is justified. Karachi’s total sanctioned police force is 29,000 officers, which is wholly inadequate to provide protection to its citizens, let alone special security cover for public figures. But politicians and lawmakers should set an example. Is it not possible for their gunmen to conceal their weapons especially in public? Here we must look at security arrangements for public figures in foreign countries. Foreign security agents of various countries arguably do a much better job of protecting public figures than their Pakistani counterparts, and without brandishing heavy weapons in public. Discretion is the better part of valour. The scourge of guns in this city cannot be eliminated without public figures taking the lead. Maintaining personal security is one thing. Illegally displaying weapons to establish one’s status in society is quite another.\n\nSource: [url]http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/14-gun-culture-zj-03[/url]', 0, 1, '110.37.78.45', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2879, 72163),

Because if the decocker is faulty, it can result in a fatal accident...[/quote]\n\nbhai jan.. as far as 92 clone is concerned, when we push the safety DOWN in safe condition.. first of all the striker knob that comes between the firing pin and hammer rotates up, further pushing of safety lever presses the lever located on right side just between the grip and slide on the frame which releases the sear to bring hammer down. \nThis type of safety design is very safe indeed, there is left no physical connection between hammer and firepin as the striker knob(dont know the proper term Beretta use to define this feature) that lies between hammer and pin rotates and moves up... but yes fire-pin block can be a tricky thing as it functions intrenally. If you have your firepin changed or remade, make sure it is milled properly with all necessary cuts and grooves, as these cuts are responsible for the firepin block to function properly. This block rises up when you fully press the trigger and protrudes out the slide on a 92FS. As per design, copied glocks are more prone to failure regarding internal trigger related safeties. I have a copied SIGP226 which never failed on its decocking function, but one can imagine if decocking a copied SIG might put the hammer down all the way on the firepin instead of keeping it on a predefined constant distance.

Hence it is no surprise that politicians, the affluent and other elites in Karachi are moving about the metropolis with heavily armed guards in plain clothes.\n\nSome of these gunmen are armed with sophisticated weapons that do not belong to the city streets. What is perhaps more disturbing is that the city’s police force appears to be reluctant to confront these individuals. The display of even licensed weapons by persons in plain clothes is not allowed under the law, unless approved by the home ministry. Yet such permission is generally not thought necessary as policemen do not want to risk ‘offending’ the person being guarded. No one is above the law and when the country’s precarious security situation is considered, no one should feel offended when asked to provide identification or legal documents, especially keeping in mind the lethal weapons in question.\n\nNevertheless, the need for armed guards for politicians and public figures who need extra security is justified. Karachi’s total sanctioned police force is 29,000 officers, which is wholly inadequate to provide protection to its citizens, let alone special security cover for public figures. But politicians and lawmakers should set an example. Is it not possible for their gunmen to conceal their weapons especially in public? Here we must look at security arrangements for public figures in foreign countries. Foreign security agents of various countries arguably do a much better job of protecting public figures than their Pakistani counterparts, and without brandishing heavy weapons in public. Discretion is the better part of valour. The scourge of guns in this city cannot be eliminated without public figures taking the lead. Maintaining personal security is one thing. Illegally displaying weapons to establish one’s status in society is quite another.\n\nSource: [url]http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/14-gun-culture-zj-03[/url][/quote]', 0, 1, '59.103.192.33', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2879, 72564),

It''s the male ego thing and one reason I prefer female students to men.  I think the man is wrong to presume that woman can''t carry what he might carrying.  I fully acknowledge that the unique women one man is thinking of may not be capable of carrying what he is carrying; but the broad brush should not be used.\n\nInstead, we should apply the same criterion for choosing a gun for a woman as we would for a man.  In no particular order, those criterion are:\n\n- size of hands\n- strength of forearms and wrists\n- sensitivity to recoil\n- desired caliber\n- desired capacity\n- method of carry/concealment\n\nOf these, the one that most dictates the gun is not size of hands, strength of forearm and wrists, or even sensitivity to recoil... which is what most people consider first, but instead it is [u][b]method of carry/concealment.[/b][/u]\n\nWomen tend to have wider hips and they abhore any method of dress that accents their hip girth.  You all well know that the best place to carry a gun is strong side, at hip level, but to do so increases hip girth.  When they cover the gun with clothing hip girth increases again.  The result is women often don''t wish to carry guns on their hips, they prefer a gun in a shoulder carried purse or bag. \n\nWhen they go to a firearm carried in a purse bag, it can (but not always) affect the size of the gun carried.  Usually the woman wishes to carry a smaller firearm which is lighter.  It weighs less, it doesn''t deform the shape of the purse or bag as badly.\n\nMy opinon is that [b][u]desired caliber[/u][/b] is largely irrelevent.  Any .380, 9mm, .357 Sig, .40 S&W or .45 auto cartridge will do.  From my readings on PakGuns it appears 9mm is most readily available and it works wonderfully in stopping a threat (I know).\n\nAlso for consideration are the .32 and .22lr.  I know I am a rebel when I suggest this.  But .22lr and .32 have been killing people for a respectable period of time.  More important than caliber is accuracy.  When the bullet is placed where it should be, threats are stopped.  Learn to shoot, the bullet will do it''s job.\n\n[u][b]Hand size[/b][/u] is important, but because an incorrect finger placement or inability to correctly place the trigger finger on the trigger is very detrimental.  We must consider handsize if our woman has unusually small hands.  So far I have not run into many women with hands so small that a Beretta, Glock, Sig, etc was too large for them.  Interestingly the 1911 is a nicely sized grip for most people.\n\n[u][b]Capacity[/b][/u] is of some concern, but only minorly and women must simply be ready to accept the reality that as they insist on more cartridges they must accept a large gun in some fashion and more weight.\n\nNow we get to the three concerns most men first think of when choosing a gun for a female: strength, hand size, and recoil sensitivity.\n\nWhile most men assume that women prefer 9mm to .40 or .45 due to [u][b]recoil sensitivity[/b][/u], my experience has shown me that women tend to prefer the .45''s push over the 9mm snap.  This is the result of what''s known as impulse.  9mm tend to achieve a higher velocity faster than the .45.  The length of the energy spike and it''s amplitude can be measured.  The 9mm tends to be a shorter higher graph than the .45''s logner, lower graph.   I know it is counter intuitive, but it is what I have observed and other instructors report as well.  Regardless, recoil is always subjective.  What we conclude on a board means nothing if the women shooting says, "I don''t like it."   \n\nOnly once have I encountered a woman who was so recoil sensitive she couldn''t shoot 9mm - .45.\n\nPlease also consider that as the gun get''s smaller and lighter, often it results in nasty recoil.  I returned a Glock 27 because it was simply too unpleasant to shoot.\n\nAnd, only once have I encountered a woman who lacked the [u][b]wrist/forearm strength[/b][/u] to handle 9mm - .45. Interestingly enough I have also encountered one male. Proper grip on the gun is more important than the strength of the hands.\n\nSo I can suggest the 1911 for many women, if you can find one in 9mm that''s even better.\n\n[quote]I own a glock 26 which I find very convinient, easy to shoot and handle and it fits my hands very well. As for the bigger pistols i cannot even manage to load them because the spring is soooo hard.[/quote]\n\nThe spring will loosen up over time.\n\n[quote]Is there a handgun in big bores which is better than a glock 26?[/quote]\n\nDefine better?', 0, 1, '144.160.98.31', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 730, 72695),

The .308 serves police and military marksmen, Palma competitors, F-Class shooters, and deer-hunters equally well. The .308 Win delivers superb accuracy along with outstanding barrel life--it''s not unusual for a .308 barrel to return 5,000+ rounds of accurate service. Along with excellent factory-loaded ammo, a huge selection of bullets and powders is available for the .308 Winchester reloader. Loading for the .308 Win is relatively easy. The round is not finicky and great powder and projectile combinations are well-known.\n\nAnd if you want "out of the box" precision in a factory rifle, the .308 Win is hard to beat. While it may not be the "ulimate" 1000-yard cartridge or short-range paper-puncher, the .308 remains one of the best cartridges in the modern arsenal, with versatility that few other calibers can match. As a "do-it-all" cartridge that can take game, win shooting matches, and defend against foes, the .308 Winchester has few rivals.\n\n[b]Preferred Brass[/b]\n\nFor a 6BR, there is one clear choice in brass--Lapua, with Norma the only real second choice. For the .308 Winchester, choice of brass is not so simple. Most of the .308 Win precision shooters we''ve interviewed do prefer Lapua brass, but others are very happy with Norma, Winchester, Hornady Match and even Remington. Black Hills uses Winchester-made brass for its match ammo, which is capable of .5 MOA or better in many rifles. The main advantage of Lapua brass is consistency and quality. Case-wall thickness is very uniform and most lots have shown less variation in weight than other headstamps. But Winchester brass performs very well in the .308. And, at $24/100, Winchester costs 40% less than Lapua brass. Even if you can potentially get more loadings out of a Lapua case, Winchester brass offers more bang for the buck. You''ll find a lot of once-fired Federal Gold Medal Match brass available. While it tends to shoot accurately, we''ve found GMM brass is relatively soft compared to Lapua or Winchester, so the primer pockets tend to loosen up after just three or four reloadings.\n\nIn addition to commercial brass, many .308 Win shooters reload boxer-primed military cases such as Lake City, IMI, and Hirtenberger. The Lake City Match brass is pretty good. Some lots have been excellent. The standard Lake City fodder is inferior to Winchester. IMI brass has a reputation for being strong, but we advise you only to purchase it new. Some used lots of IMI brass from Israel have been defective. If you are looking for ultimate accuracy, IMI will probably disappoint you, though it''s good for gas guns that are tough on cases.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about military brass is that the internal capacity will probably be less than commercial .308 Win brass, because military brass often has thicker webs or casewalls. Montana Marine reports his fire-formed milsurp cases hold 56 grains of H20 on average compared to 58 grains for fire-formed Winchester. Given the reduced capacity of military brass, you should reduce posted max loads by 1.5 grains when loading with Lake City or most other milsurp brass. However, the IMI MATCH brass is closer to commercial brass in internal case capacity (ICC). Kevin Beggs reports: "Fired, my IMI Match brass runs with an ICC of 55.0gr and bumping the shoulder back .001" will net me an ICC average of 54.0gr. LAPUA runs an average of 54.4gr and Federal runs an average of 54.3gr ICC."\n\n[b]Match Bullets[/b]\n\nWhat you see below is just a fraction of the quality 30-caliber match bullets available to .308 shooters. Figure there are at least twenty projectiles you might consider. Still, with such a large selection, nearly all the competitors we interviewed were using one of five bullets: 155 Berger, 155 Lapua Scenar, 155 Sierra MK, 168 Sierra MK, or 175 Sierra MK. A few guys have had good luck with the 168gr Amax (.475 BC), and some guys like to shoot the heavy 185gr Bergers (.569 BC), 185gr Scenars (.521 BC), or 190gr SMKs (.533 BC) at 1000 yards, but the vast majority of .308 shooters are running the 155s, or the 168 or 175 Sierras. Among the 155s, John Whidden has had great success with the Bergers seating them well in the lands. The Lapua 155 has an impressive .508 BC (and you can see that it is even longer than a 175 MK), and you can launch it much faster than a 168- or 175-grainer. Between the 168 SMK (.488 BC) and 175 SMK (.505 BC), most shooters seem to think the slippery 175 is a better bullet overall and it definitely has an edge at longer distance--less drop and less windage. We suggest, in developing initial loads for your .308, that you focus on one of these five projectiles, and then maybe try a few Amaxs or the heavier SMKs. Sierra will start selling a new 210gr SMK early next year. It''s probably a little heavy for a .308, but it should work very well in a 300WM or 30-06.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s1.postimage.org/YEdti.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Hunting Bullets[/b]\n\nThe major bullet manufacturers, Barnes, Hornady, Nosler, Sierra, Speer, and Swift provide a wide variety of hunting bullets in .308 caliber with weights ranging from 100 grains or so to 240 grains. For smaller game and varmints, the Sierra 110gr Varminter bullet has proven very accurate. For deer-sized game, a bullet in the 150-grain range (such as the Swift Scirocco) running 2850+ fps is very effective. Reader M700 tells us: "Something that is deadly accurate and has fast expansion gets my vote for mid-longish range deer hunting. Say either a Nosler Ballistic Tip or a Sierra SPBT GameKing. Both have the reputation for fast expansion and excellent accuracy. With a decent .308 Win you can boot the 150 up to around 2900 fps and get excellent accuracy as well as deadly on-game performance." The Hornady 165gr SST, with its excellent .447 BC, is another good choice for longer-range shots on deer. For Elk and large game, select a heavier, controlled-expansion bullet such as the 180gr Nosler Partition.\n\n[b]Factory Loaded Match Ammo[/b]\n\nOne of the great things about the .308 Win is the availability of high-quality factory-loaded ammo. Using 168gr Federal Gold Medal Match this editor managed to coax a .75-moa group from a FAL clone with iron sights. Many shooters who don''t have the time to reload shoot GMM or Black Hills exclusively, and they hold their own in tactical competitions. Jacob Gottfredson, noted writer for Precision Shooting, told us that he often uses Black Hills match ammo in competition: "In tactical matches, an extra quarter-MOA of accuracy (from handloads) won''t make you a winner if you can''t range the targets and dope the wind. You could shoot 175gr Black Hills the whole match and easily end up with a trophy". Along with Federal and Black Hills, Lapua makes truly outstanding .308 match ammunition fitted with 155gr, 167gr, or 185gr Scenar bullets. The Lapua ammo is capable of shooting under half-MOA in a good rifle. It costs about $25.00 per box of 20 from Grafs.com. For great prices on Federal GMM ($16/20 for 168s) go to OutdoorMarksman.com.\n\nSo which factory ammo is the best? Chances are you should try Black Hills, Federal and Lapua and let your gun decide. SniperCentral.com recently conducted a Match Grade Ammo Comparison test, including M118 LR, used by U.S. military snipers. The tester concluded: "The Federal Gold Medal Match is still the standard by which all other match ammo is judged. How they can get such good accuracy and consistency from such mass produced ammo is a mystery to me. Black Hills match grade ammo is right up there with Federal, is just as consistent, and in my particular rifle, is just as accurate, though I cannot say its any MORE accurate than Federal. It''s a good alternative, with the price per box about $2 cheaper than Federal. The HSM ammo is the cheapest of them all by a large margin (about $5 cheaper then Black Hills, and about $7 cheaper then federal per box). But it''s also not nearly as accurate. You can expect the same accuracy as M118, and it makes a good replacement for those that cannot get M118."\n\n[b]Choosing the Right Powder and Load Testing[/b]\n\nFor the 160-175 grain boattails used by the majority of .308 shooters, you want a powder of medium burn rate that gives close to 100% load density. The "classic" .308 load for 168gr SMKs is IMR 4064 with Federal primers. However, these days Varget is probably slightly more popular. Lot variance has frustrated Varget users, however. Jerry Tierney has had to tweak his .308 Palma Varget load up to two full grains to maintain optimal velocity. Tech Note: If you use QuickLOAD, we suggest you select data for ADI 2208 rather than Hodgdon Varget. This, we''ve found, will give more realistic numbers.\n\nIn addition to Varget and IMR 4064, a half-dozen or more other powders work extremely well in the .308 case: AA 2460, BLC-2, IMR 4895, Reloader 15, Ramshot TAC, VV N150, and VV N540. Some folks are seeing a little more velocity with RL15 than with Varget, but Varget is still less temperature sensitive--important if you''re running near max. Most of the guys we know shooting the Sierra or Lapua 155s are using Varget. For Sierra''s 110gr Varminter and other light bullets, you can use a faster-burning powder such as Benchmark or VV N135. In general, the .308 seems to achieve its best accuracy with case-filling loads running pretty stout pressures. For safety''s sake, always start at least 10% below recommended maximums, and watch for pressure signs carefully. Often you can be over-pressure even without tell-tale signs on the primer cup. One trick we use is to take a shell-holder to the range. After firing a test case, if you have difficulty sliding it into the shell-holder, the web has expanded excessively, meaning your pressure is too high. For a good selection of "safe" loads, click on the Sierra icon to download Sierra''s .308 Winchester Load Map.\n\nWhen choosing a load to test, keep in mind that seating depths can make a HUGE difference in pressure. Remember that seating bullets into the lands can raise pressures but moving 0.020" or more AWAY from the lands can also raise pressures, because you are reducing the effective case capacity. Many readers ask us "should I jam or jump my bullets." There is no right answer for every gun. For every guy getting great results at .015" jam, there is another guy doing well with a 0.025" jump. In general, most popular .308 match bullets (Bergers excepted) are tolerant of jump. This is certainly true of the 168 and 175 SMKs. So don''t worry that you may be sacrificing a great deal of accuracy by loading to mag length, even if that puts you pretty far from the lands.\n\n[b]Primers[/b]\n\nWe wish we could say something definitive about primers--but the truth is both Federals and CCIs are winning their share of matches. Federal 210m, and CCI BR2s have both proven accurate with all the most popular propellants for match ammo. We can say that if you have experienced issues with cratering and primer piercing, go with the CCIs. They have a harder cup. Among other primers, WLRs are used in Black Hills match ammo and they perform admirably. Russian primers are the newest thing to hit the market, and by all indications they work as well or better than the best domestic primers (so long as the rather hard Russian cups are firmly seated to proper depth). Note, Russian primers are currently distributed by PMC and retailed in PMC boxes. However, PMC will not import them after the first of the year. AccurateShooter.com has been informed that a large, well-known foreign ammunition company will take over importation of the Russian primers and they should be readily available by the second quarter of 2006.\n\n[b]Reloading and Die Selection[/b]\n\nReloading for the .308 is straight-forward. The cartridge is very forgiving and performs exceptionally well with a wide variety of powders and bullets. Different applications require different tools and techniques, however. Those shooting semi-auto "gas guns" such as the M1A and FN-FAL clones should full-length size after each firing. Palma shooters, who need to be at near-max pressures to be competitive, should use the strongest brass available and should pay special attention to seating depths. At high pressures, Palma shooters can also benefit from body-sizing or full-length sizing after each firing.\n\nFull-length Sizing (Body and Neck): The problem with full-length sizing is that virtually all commercial dies reduce the neck diameter much more than necessary. This results in excessive neck tension and can make bullets difficult to seat smoothly. There are two good solutions to the problem, and neither is very expensive.\n\n1. Purchase a Forster .308 full-length sizing die. Measure a loaded round with a bullet seated, and note the outside neck diameter. Then send your die to Forster and for $10 (plus shipping) Forster will hone the neck to the dimension you specify. For bolt guns, we suggest .002" under the neck diameter of a loaded round. For gas guns, go .003" under. Total cost is about $45.00, including the die.\n\n2. Hornady can make you a custom full-length sizing die for about $75.00 plus shipping. Just send them a few fired cases and a reamer print (if you have it). They can create a die that gives you ideal neck tension, as well as just the right amount of sizing at the shoulder and web. Call Hornady and ask for Lonnie Hummel. Scott Parker recently had a die like this made and he reports: "Average runout for 65 rounds was .0004". All 65 rounds showed less than .001" runout."\n\nNeck Sizing Only: If you are not working your brass too much with very hot loads, you can probably get by with neck-sizing only. Bushing dies are convenient and allow you to adjust tension as easily as swapping in a new bushing, but this can contribute to build-up of brass at the neck-shoulder junction. If you do neck-size only, you should experiment with the bushing position. Some shooters get best results only sizing one-half to two-thirds of the neck. Another inexpensive option is the Lee Collet Die. This works by squeezing the neck around a metal mandrel that extends down into the case. Collet dies can produce very low run-out, they don''t cause brass build-up at the neck-shoulder junction, and they are inexpensive. However, it is somewhat difficult to precisely control the amount of tension and the collet''s fingers can leave marks on your brass. Still, some .308 shooters swear by the Lee die.\n\nNeck-Sizing with Optional Body Sizing: Most .308 shooters can get away with neck-sizing only for a while, but after 4-5 firings extraction becomes difficult. Then it''s time to size the brass. An inexpensive Redding body die is the way to go. Getting just the right amount of sizing is the hard part--you want to just size the case enough so that it feeds and extracts easily. With some presses, the ram must be set to "cam-over" in order to size the case enough. This means you must first set the bottom of the die to touch the shell-holder, then screw it down a little further, 1/8th turn at a time.\n\n[b]Barrel Length and Twist Rate[/b]\n\nYou''ll see a wide range of barrel lengths and twist rates on precision .308 Win rifles. At one end of the spectrum, a tactical shooter who needs a compact, quick-handling rifle, may select a 20" barrel. The popular Rem 700 LTR (Light Tactical Rifle) features a 20" fluted barrel. On the other hand, Palma shooters, who need to keep a 155-grain bullet supersonic at 1000 yards, normally opt for barrels 30-32" in length. The extra length also provide a longer sight radius--a big benefit when using iron sights. A shorter barrel definitely delivers less velocity, all other factors being equal. With most powder/bullet combinations, you can figure an additional 25-30 fps per inch going from 20 to 25 inches. From 25 to 30 inches, add an extra 17-20 fps. From 30-33 inches you may pick up 15-17 fps or so, with appropriate powders. \n\nA 1:10" twist rate will let you shoot the popular medium and heavy 30-caliber bullets up to the 210-grainers from Berger and Sierra (provided your barrel delivers enough velocity for the heavy bullets). A ten-twist can also work well with the lighter projectiles. John Whidden, who won the recent U.S. Palma Team Trials, has had great success shooting 155gr Bergers with a Broughton 10-twist 5C barrel. A 1:11" twist, found on many factory rifles, is a good compromise. Palma competitors using the Sierra or Lapua 155s have favored 1:12" or 1:13" twist rates, with the theory being that a slower twist rate may offer better velocity since there is less friction in the barrel. A 1:13" twist is fine for deer hunters who prefer a 150gr-class bullet moving 2850-2900 fps.\n\n[b][color=red].308 Win vs. 7.62x51--The Straight Scoop[/color][/b]\n\n[color=red]Before we go much further, we want to address the oft-posed question "Are the .308 Winchester and 7.62x51 NATO one and the same?" The simple answer is no. There are differences in chamber specs and maximum pressures. The SAMMI/CIP maximum pressure for the .308 Win cartridge is 62,000 psi, while the 7.62x51 max is 50,000 psi. Also, the headspace is slightly different. The .308 Win "Go Gauge" is 1.630" vs. 1.635" for the 7.62x51. The .308''s "No-Go" dimension is 1.634" vs. 1.6405" for a 7.62x51 "No Go" gauge. That said, it is normally fine to shoot quality 7.62x51 NATO ammo in a gun chambered for the .308 Winchester (though not all NATO ammo is identical). Clint McKee of Fulton Armory notes: "[N]obody makes 7.62mm (NATO) ammo that isn''t to the .308 ''headspace'' dimension spec. So 7.62mm ammo fits nicely into .308 chambers, as a rule." You CAN encounter problems going the other way, however. A commercial .308 Win round can exceed the max rated pressure for the 7.62x51. So, you should avoid putting full-power .308 Win rounds into military surplus rifles that have been designed for 50,000 psi max. For more information on this interesting topic, read the following articles: Gun Zone''s 30 Caliber FAQ; Cruffler.com Technical Trivia, June 2001; and last, but not least, Steve Redgwell''s .308 vs 7.62x51 Analysis, which really provides a definitive explanation. Reloaders should also note that military ammo often is made with a thicker web. Consequently the case capacity of 7.62x51 brass is usually less than that of commercial .308 brass. You may need to reduce recommended .308 Winchester loads by as much as 2 full grains, if you reload with military 7.62x51 brass, such as Lake City or IMI.[/color]\n\n[b]SOURCE:[/b] [url]http://www.6mmbr.com/308Win.html[/url]\n\nCartridge price 7.62x51 (G3) (KHI): Rs. 35 to Rs. 50', 0, 1, '110.37.1.187', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2930, 73446),

This was done only after extensive testing confirmed the high tech Polymer parts showed superior wear characteristics and self lubricating properties. We feel these parts are a better choice in their intended usage then the originals, predominately due to the fact that the operating nature of these parts is that the surface finish wears with extended use. That is "silver color" starts to show through on blued steel parts. Polymer parts do not exhibit finish wear with extensive use. Some of the Polymer parts that may see high stress loads are reinforced by overmolding a steel subassembly. You will find that all current produced pistols have polymer guide rods, triggers, safety levers, hammer spring caps / lanyard loops, magazine bottom plates and followers." \n\n[u][b]End result of all research[/b][/u]\nIt''s not the rod you have to worry about, it''s the spring. As the spring wears and slowly loses its tension it absorbs less and less of the recoil. Which means that over time the frame of the gun has to absorb more and more recoil. This can eventually cause the frame to crack.\n\nbut Stoeger/Beretta have metal frame...it was, after all, designed for a .40 cal in the first place.\n\nBottom line...if you are going to carry a weapon for self defense, do youself a favor and do not intentionally make it unreliable by changing OEM parts with after-market" add-ons :/', 0, 1, '119.152.55.33', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 42, 73478),

The recognition of the right of private defence is simply a recognition of the importance of the instinct of self preservation for the well-being of human society. Self-defence is the nature''s oldest law. It is based on the law of necessity of self preservation. The right of self-defence conferred by section 96, P. P. C. is to the effect that every person has a right to hold his ground manfully and not to run away like a coward. The only consideration is that a person threatened with danger of injury should not exceed the limits fixed by the law. This, of course, depends upon reasonable apprehension of danger to the person under the particular circumstances of the case. It is reasonable apprehension of danger to the body and not the actual injuries received that should judge the justification of the act of the accused. The reasonableness of the apprehension is a question of fact which depends upon the weapon used, the manner of using it, the nature of assault or other surrounding circumstances. If people armed with lethal weapons were permitted to enter the abode of peaceful citizens to commit criminal trespass and at the same time occupants were not given complete right of defence to repel it with force, then it will tantamount to conceding to the law of jungle. The defiant and head-strong members of society will set at rampage and no body will be safe in his house and the very golden concept that one''s house is his castle will be destroyed.

It''s excellent inherent accuracy led to it being extremely popular for decades as a bench rest round and a varminting cartridge. The .222 was eventually surpassed in 1975 by the 6mm PPC, a very popular bench rest cartridge, but although falling out of favour slightly, the .222 is still around. The .222 case provided the basis for the .223 Remington (which largely led to the .222 falling out of favour), the .221 Fireball and the new .204 Ruger. The .222 Remington typically fires a 55 grain bullet at 3,100 FPS generating 1,200 foot pounds energy.\n\n\n\n\n [b]5.45x39[/b]The 5.45x39 was introduced into service in 1974 for the new AK-74 assault rifle. Over the next few years it replaced the 7.62x39 cartridge as the standard Soviet assault weapon cartridge. The new bullets were lighter so the rifles produced less recoil allowing more accurate fire than the previous 7.62 bullets. The bullets in this cartridge are of unusual design. The main core of the bullet is made of mild steel with a copper jacket. Behind the pointed tip of the bullet is a small air gap with a small amount of lead covering the front of the steel core. Upon impact, the lead expands because of the steel core following it. This allows the bullet some grip and splits open the copper jacket allowing the core to penetrate the target. In 1987 a steel rod in the original 7N6 bullets was hardened to 60 HRC. In 1992 the size of the steel penetrator was increased and the lead plug in front of it discarded. This bullet was designated the 7N10 "improved penetration". In 1994 the 7N10 design was improved by filling the air space with lead. The 7N22 armour-piercing bullet, introduced in 1998, has a sharp-pointed steel penetrator and retaining the soft lead plug in the nose for jacket discarding. The recent 7N24 "super-armour-piercing" bullet has a penetrator made of tungsten carbide. Reloading supplies for 5.45x39 are generally not available and milsurp ammo is berdan primed and has a dark red lacquer sealing the bullet and the primer to waterproof the round. It typically propels a 56 grain bullet at 2,850 FPS giving 1,000 foot pounds energy.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsuF35i][img]http://s2.postimage.org/uF35i.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nFrom Left to Right\n .22-250 ,7.62x39 ,6mm PPC ,.204 Ruger ,.223 Ackley Improved ,[b].222 Remington[/b] ,.223 Remington ,[b]5.45x39[/b] ,.17 Remington ,.221 Remington Fireball ,.17 Remington Fireball ,.22 Hornet .', 0, 1, '111.92.128.206', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2691, 73484),

Reason, for safety was that in the mid 80s to early 90s many police officers in US - were in fact shooting themselves in the knee or foot because they were drawing the weapon with their finger on the trigger - and this was because prior to the Glock begining era most of the weapons on the market were or had the cocked and locked feature - called condition one.  Most officers carried S&W 645, Colts, and even the older Berettas with the safeties in the frames were condition one.

Regards[/quote]\n\n\nwelcome here Haider Sb,   i didn''t get your exact means .....   are you looking for any specific ammo for 10 gauge?  although 10gauge is not a regular/ common gauge in shotguns here in Pakistan but in other countries they are using it as it is more powerful than 12 gauge and so its have very hard recoil as well ....... anyway below is an advertisement along with a photo of a classic 10 gauge shell ...\n\n[b]An early shotgun shell....... [/b]\n\nThis is a 10 gauge ''conical base'' shotgun shell, made by the Saint Louis Patent Shell Manufacturing Company of Saint Louis, Missouri. The company was incorporated in 1875, for the purpose of producing shotgun shells based on the patent of David E. Williams. His patent #108,543 covered a shell with a conical chamber in the base, formed of coiled paper and extending about an inch up the inside of the shell. The advantages gained from this design, according to the 1876 James Bown & Company advertisement shown below, are that ''a large saving is effected in the quantity of powder required, and the recoil is consequently much lessened''. Another obvious benefit would be the strengthening of the hull where it meets the front edge of the brass base. This coupled with the reduced loads would allow the shooter to get more reloads out of a case before the hull began to separate from the base. The Saint Louis Patent Shell Manufacturing Company went out of business in 1881, due most likely to their inability to establish a niche in a market dominated by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company and the Union Metallic Cartridge Company. These shells sold for $1.50 per hundred in10 gauge and $1.25 per hundred in12 gauge. Anyone run across a full box or two of these anytime recently?  \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1du6H9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1du6H9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1du9bi][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1du9bi.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '58.65.160.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2771, 73916),

From inexpensive break open single shots to ultra pricey doubles and everything in between. The average sportsman or person using a shotgun for personal security will likely be seen with either a pump action or auto loading design. We will be discussing the types of shotguns and their uses in more detail in future articles.\n\n[b]Gauges of modern shotguns:[/b]\n\nThe 10 gauge has a nominal bore diameter of .770 inch. It is the largest bore shotgun currently manufactured and for which factory ammunition is available. Its history goes back to before the turn of the 20th century. Although the 12 gauge is much more popular than the 10 gauge the 10 has increased in popularity in recent years due to the mandating of non lead shot for waterfowl hunting. Since the non lead shot is less effective the larger 3 ½ inch magnum loads of the 10 gauge makes up for the difference.\nThe 12 gauge has a nominal bore diameter of .729 inch. It is the most popular gauge shotgun outselling all the other gauges combined. The 12 gauge is the jack of all trades of shotguns. Whether being used to shoot sporting clays, waterfowl or hunting deer it is the all around choice for shotgunners. Being the most popular gun it also has the most offering of ammunition. Every ammunition manufacturer makes several loading of the 12 gauge. \n\nThe 16 gauge is becoming more and more obsolete as every year passes. With a nominal bore diameter of .662 inch it is not a light and handy as the 20 gauge but can’t compete with the 12 gauge on the high end especially when non lead shot is required.\n\nThe 20 gauge is the second most popular gauge after the 12 gauge. With a nominal bore diameter of .615 inch it is widely used for sporting clays and skeet shooting. 20 gauge ammunition is very plentiful and each manufacturer ha several offerings. The popularity of this gauge is derived form it’s being a low recoil shotgun that works well at shotgun games. In the field especially with non lead shot it is not the best choice for actual hunting. \n\nThe smallest shotgun bore currently available is the .410. Unlike other shotguns which are designated by gauge, an old world measurement indicating how many lead balls of bore diameter equal a pound of weight, the .410 directly refers to the bore diameter. The .410 is really too light for any meaningful role as a hunting weapon. It is also not a good choice to break sporting clays as the shot pattern is thin and weak. About the only purpose for this size is as a training weapon for introducing people to shotgunning due to its very light recoil. Not that birds or clays can’t be dispatched with the .410, but it is a short range weapon requiring very good shooting skills to be used effectively. This of course contradicts its best use as a training weapon for the inexperienced.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s4.postimage.org/UIpHS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1dzWm9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s4.postimage.org/UIJF0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1dA7PS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1dAwMi.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '58.65.160.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2771, 73920),

There was one in black for 22k and this I paid 28k, Its slightly lighter than the other clones I saw at the shop. I am interested in changing the grips along with the silver screws as well. There are many clones in the market and hard to tell which one is better, but there were some differences in the finishing of the 22k clones. This seems to be of a better quality and finish so I purchased it. back in the UK and USA you can only dream of owning a weapon after so many checks. So in Pakistan one can acquire a weapon and yes I did manage to get the all Pakistan licence.

We all are agreed on it. Hence if the barrel life for DAP round is 9k, its defnintely much more for normal (P) rounds that all of us mostly use in our handguns. Only 9mm P rounds have very less damage to barrel groves as compared to DAP ammunation. I hope this will clear the point.\n\nMoreover, CF98.NP42 have fully supported chambers.

"Russian" refers to the supposed country of origin of the game and roulette to the element of risk-taking and the spinning of the revolver''s cylinder being reminiscent of spinning a roulette wheel.\nThe form of the game can be as varied as the participants or their motives (displays of bravado, boredom, suicide, etc.), but typically a single round is placed in a six-shot revolver resulting in a 1/6 (or approximately 16.67%) chance of the revolver discharging the round. Regardless of any player''s position in the shooting sequence, his initial odds are the same as for all other players.\n\nMost of the legends abound regarding the invention of Russian roulette are, predictably, set in Russia or occur among Russian soldiers.\n\nIn one legend, 19th-century Russian prisoners were forced to play the game while the prison guards bet on the outcome. In another version, desperate and suicidal officers in the Russian army played the game to impress each other.', 0, 1, '119.153.2.72', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2961, 74263),

(66237, 2255, 0, 'Basharat', 60, '', 1256794725, 'I have noticed a trend in Karachi, that most people think that the Glock series of Pistols is the end all and be all of handguns.  I have also noticed that most of these people have very little knowledge of fire arms (I am not referring to the fine members of this distinguished forum but people I''ve observed in person).  In my opinion the Glock is and excellent handgun (although it would not be my first choice) however saying it''s the best can not be justified (least of all by people who have very little experience with firearms).  \n\n"the best" is really personal preference in combination with what your pocket will allow (I am dead against the use of credit cards for any purchase I believe you should buy things the old fashioned way save up till you can afford it). \nFor example, I''m a shikari (raised on lee Enfield and mosin nagant) by virtue of my family and background and a gun enthusiast for the same reason.  The standard handgun that each and every member of my family has some variant or the other of the Tokarev pistol.  It’s cheap, it never jams and the round is more potent than the 9mm.  \n\nPersonaly my top 3 favorites are\n1.	 .45 1911\n2.	7.62 x 25 TT\n3.	Sig 226 (or the Norinco clone)\nGlock makes a good pistol (although not one of my favorites), H&K, Springfield, Taurus, even Ruger.\n\nIn my opinion the 9mm is not a very effective round.  And the .40 although it has most of the performance characteristics of the .45 is unfortunately not a .45.  These rounds are expensive in Pakistan and that might be a reason for their lack of popularity.  \n\nI don''t recommend guns to people who aren''t familiar with them and I find the “fashion” of having a glock or any hand gun for that matter revolting. So before anyone goes out and buys a gun and does some irreparable damage to themselves or to another person ask yourself the following questions:  \n\nDo you have any children living in your home?\n(if you do, what do you do with this gun when you''re not home? When they have friends over?)\n\nWhen you''re not home, where do you store the pistol? The magazine? the ammunition? (when your pistol is stored it must be unloaded the magazine must be removed and the rounds must be removed from the magazine)\n\nIf the purpose of the handgun is HD/SD do you have it in you to shoot someone? (if you are in a life threatening situation and are incapable of shooting the threat your weapon may very well be turned against you by those who mean to do you harm so your weapon will do more harm than good)\n\nCan you shoot someone and kill them? (same logic as the previous point)\n\nI have seen and heard of several cases over the last many years where a well meaning parent bought a pistol, hid it from the children and came home to a dead child. Or their husband got angry and shot the wife or the gun went of by mistake etc. accidents with a firearm can be life altering if not fatal.\n\nHave you ever shot a handgun before? (do you know correct gun safety, do you know correct maintenance, basically what good is it if you can’t use it)\n\nCan you shoot and kill someone? (Notice I''ve asked this before? Many people say they can, but really can''t, if you can’t the gun will be a liability to your safety)\n\nIf the gun is locked anywhere, (safe, drawer, lock box, nightstand) it is of no value when someone breaks in.\n\n\nCan you wake up from a dead sleep, find your pistol, find your magazine, load it, find the intruder, identify that it''s not "one of your own" and place a well shot round in the chest in the dark with your heart rate at about 160 beats per minute and your breathing nearly out of control, and not through your Childs bedroom wall?\n\nIf you must have a gun at home, I recommend a  pump shotgun.\n\nIf you can''t actually shoot someone, or had problems with any of the questions above, I REALLY recommend a thick lathi. They''re easy to get, easy to maintain, have more than one use, most people CAN hit someone, they make a nice cracking sound when you hit someone with it, and they hurt like hell.\n\nI Guess what i''m trying to say is a gun is not "cool" it''s not "sexy" it''s a very serious piece of equipment so please treat it as it deserves.', 0, 1, '58.181.101.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2976, 74787),

Industrial strength is only available in fixed packeging and with a price tag of around 2K-3K rupees.\n\n[b]Directions for use:[/b]\n\nfirst clean the barrel of any powder/carbon fouling then wet a piece of cloth with the Pakguns Copper Solvent and run it through the bore, let is sit for five minutes and run a clean piece of cloth through the bore. Repeat if necessary. after cleaning, wash the barrel with tap water to remove any traces of ammonia left in the bore. dry the barrel, remove any traces of water and lubricate with gun oil.\n\nDo give it try, ur barrels will come out nice and clean, as if never used. they say removing copper fouling increases accuracy. not to me, cause i''m a bad shot to begin with. :)\n\n[b]Regards.[/b][/quote]', 0, 1, '119.155.98.168', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2640, 75029),

Just take a close look at the pictures, yeah I mean CLOSE look. Only the GRIP is special and the gun is in stainless steel. No more. No additional functions, no safeties, no different mechanism! It''s just a beautified Serbian TT, that''s it! If there is too much hassles with the import, just get me the grips somehow, and I''ll turn the M-57 into a lux, by having it chromed by some real professional! Waqas, it''s worth a thought, isn''t it? Ask the Miss, if we could get the grips, somehow, if the gun itself is overly priced and import not possible.

I wish to be short, you''re right most people consider the Glock as symbol of status, in as much as our people normally as a trend go for Corolla in cars, Sony in TV''s and Nokia with mobiles! This doesn''t mean that Corolla is the best car in the world, Samsung wouldn''t show you good movies, or that SE would make you a bad phone! It''s just a trend we''ve adopted, in aping each others! Our people normally do not know the actual requirement for which an item is needed, or the specifications of it, they just gotta have what the neighbor has! Or what the rival or friend has! As far as 30 cal vs 9mm is concerned, U.S army could have chosen the .30 over the 9mm, when they replaced the .45 as a sidearm! U.S manufacturers could even make much better looking TT''s , even more advanced and sophisticated, if it had been more TISSUE DAMAGING than the 9mm! I don''t quite agree that the .30 necessarily would be more powerful or harmful than the 9mm, in spite of greater muzzle velocity. It just has more "penetrative power", hence the hole in above picture. If the steel above could have had "feelings", which part of it do you think would be more "hurting", the "holed" or the seriously indented one? The TT ammo was literally meant to be armor piercing and before the WW2 was vastly used by the russians for quick, brutal killings of resistant non-armed peasants, who would refuse the communist state taxes from hard earned agri yields. etc! With "brutal" is meant headshots, multiple shots, just get the job done! Finally, the 12 gauge you suggest, has a lot more potential of serious accidental harm than the handgun, in my opinion!

Let me give you an example....\n\nMy friends elder brother who lived in the middle east recently moved to Pakistan. When I met him, he asked me about guns as my friend told him about my interest in firearms. He wanted to buy a weapon as according to him "Mulk kai halaat itnay kharab hein kai i am even scared to go out" .... Instantly, I told him to get a SD weapon, a pistol preferably ... But what I had to hear in response was unbearable. \n\nFirst of, he said that he didn''t believe in "License". According to him, he was always lead to believe that weapons are like fruit in Pakistan. You don''t need a license for it. And immediately, he said that "Yaar koi Glock Shlock laina hai menay, kitnay ka ata hai? 50 hazaar ka aajaye ga?" ....\n\nWell you can imagine how frustrated I must be by that time. I told him that don''t even THINK of buying an illegal weapon. And told him the "Actual" price of Glock and the guy had the nerve to argue with me that I''m wrong. :P\n\nAnyway, it''s one of those things where the general awaam knows about the "Famous" things like for example, ask any common man to name a fighter jet and they''ll instantly say "F-16". Not Mirage, Not F-7P, Not JF-17, F-6 which are all serving with our air force (F-6 is retired though). Anyway, that''s all there is to it.

Recommending Type III and above for the .30 is a joke.[/quote]\n\nSince I know a little bit about armour, both soft and hard, I could write pages about this comment. However, I would just make a general observation that NIJ Level III is quite easily defeated by .38 (.30 Tokarev) shot, a 90 degree interaction or a 45 degree interaction. 9mm interaction with armour depends on many many factors, but generally a IIIA standard should stop a 9mm para round. Whenever introduce plate armour, carbide or ethylene, we go in a completely different type of situation then just kevlar deflection.\n\nGelatin tests show that both our .30 or 9mm has similar damage to soft tissue, I am talking FMJ rounds only here.\nIf you really want these to be SD/HD, buy HP or JHPs for better energy transfer.\n\nOtherwise, Basharat sahab a very nice article. Indeed, as a nation we are addicted to an F-16, and we love our labels. However, do you own a Glock? On the lighter side, do you have any anything against the gun?\n\nI am a a guilty glock ghareeb, and I honestly do not carry it around, or show it at every party, or mention it.
