I used it on a shoot two days back, and I noticed it was not cycling properly. it would eject the fired cartridge, but but not load  the new cartridgeinto the breach. The new cartridgewould come up, but the bolt wouldnt close shut, pushing the cartridge all the way into the chamber.  This happened about 5 times during 70  odd shots. \r\n\r\n So when I returned home, I disassembled the and found a lot of fouling inside it. The piston was extremely dirty, and the rest of the internals werent too clean either. So I first sprayed it WD 40, and used an old tooth brush too loosen the black gunk. Then I sprayed carb cleaner to blast way even the smallest speck of fouling, after I which I sprayed WD 40 again and let the gun drip dry. This process I repeated 2 hours later until it was absolutely clean, and the lightly oiled the moving parts, and friction areas with Hoppes gun oil. \r\n\r\nThen yesterday, I used the gun again, firing another 60 cartridges, and once again it failed to cycle properly, and on three occasions I had to pull back the bolt to load the new cartridge.  On my return home, I opened up the gun once again, and saw that the fouling was minimal. \r\n\r\nNow the question that comes to my mind is that, why is this gun not cycling properly?  I have been using local Eley cartridges in it. and I used them last year too without any issues. \r\n\r\nDo you think its because of the cartridges, or am I doing something wrong, or is there something wrong with the gun.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your feedback, especially the gurus of shotguns such as Denovo, 12gauge and numerous other gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThank you!', 1, 0, '182.178.16.40', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The kind of a shotgun which is easily adaptable to field use as well as sporting use such as skeet.\r\n\r\nAfter a detailed discussion I convinced him that it is pointless to convert a sporting gun into a field only gun. why would somebody buy a Corolla and spend some more money on to it only to convert it into a Mehran? The best modification goal should be to make it a dual purpose shotgun.\r\n\r\nNow when we think of a field shotgun what is the first thing that comes to mind? weight, right? and what is the first thing that hits you when you pick up a Baikal Sporting? its weight, am i right?\r\n\r\nThere you go, we now have a mission or a goal (take your pick:) ). Our goal here is to reduce the weight of a Baikal IZH27-EM-1C "Sporting" to such a level that it can be used for upland as well as sporting purposes with only a slight level of difficulty in either scenario.\r\n\r\nOur goal was to convert this 8.6Lbs beast into an under 8Lbs gun. In simple terms, the mission was to (weight wise) convert a Baikal Sporting into a Baikal field model.\r\n\r\n[B]This is what we did But first a Disclaimer as usual:[/B]\r\n\r\n[B][I]The following content is for informational purposes only.

(294416, 9637, 294299, 'GUNFREAK', 2660, '', 1346593607, '[QUOTE=Salman_Ahmed;294299]Is this the Post you were referring to ? \r\nTrue Hirtenberger L7A1 is pretty rare stuff (only 10,000 cases released to the public, and much of that not allowed for import into the US), and the Pakistanis also COUNTERFEITED Hirtenberger L7A1 as well (which is probably what you''ve seen)....\r\n\r\nA little cut-and-paste fu:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHirtenberger has produced two types of SMG ammunition. Both were developed on request for the British Ministry Of Defence:\r\n\r\nL7A1- This ammunition was produced between 1990 and 1992. Many samples exceed the NATO maximum chamber pressure specification for small arms, which is 50,000 PSI (345 MPa). For this reason, the British MOD ceased to use it. It was replaced with:\r\n\r\nL12A1- This ammunition is substantially similar, but uses a slightly reduced charge in order to stay under the 50,000 PSI NATO maximum pressure specs.\r\n\r\nBoth of these rounds feature a 124-grain FMJ ball bullet, and produce a maximum velocity of about 1,500 fps.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, these rounds were not designed for arctic conditions, nor were they developed for the Sterling SMG. They were designed for use in H&K MP5 series SMGs. Although they were undoubtedly tested under arctic conditions, the use of the term "adverse conditions" in its designation is more euphemistic than anything else.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the commercial availability of these rounds, the MOD released 12 million rounds of L7A1 ammunition as surplus. Since the ammunition is packaged in a 1,200 round case, this means that 10,000 cases were released. Since HP refuses to sell this ammunition to the public, and only produced L7A1 in 1990, 1991, and 1992, and only for the British contract, that means that the entire world''s supply consists of 10,000 cases.\r\n\r\nLikewise, within several months of release, BATF banned the importation of the ammunition, due to its being unsafe for use in handguns. This second fact makes the ammunition even more rare in the United States.\r\n\r\nIf offered this ammunition for sale, view the offer skeptically, as the above-mentioned facts limit the actual availability of such ammunition- and likewise, a considerable amount of the ammunition imported into the United States has undoubtedly been fired already by its owners.\r\n\r\nBeware of attempts to sell ammunition which is falsely advertised as " Hirt SMG ammo ". Many dealers, either due to ignorance or fraudulence, will sell standard Hirtenberger ammunition and claim that it is the SMG rounds.\r\n\r\nL7A1 ammunition can be identified by its headstamps:\r\n\r\n''HP'' (for Hirtenberger Patronen)\r\n''90'', ''91'', or ''92'' (year of production)\r\n''L7A1'' (ammunition type)\r\nNATO proof mark (a circle with a cross inside)\r\n\r\nIf the headstamp doesn''t contain "L7A1", it is NOT the SMG rounds.\r\n\r\nSome forgeries of this ammunition have been produced in other nations (particularly in Darra, Pakistan, where many forgery firearms and ammunition are produced for the black market). The easiest way to tell that the ammunition is forged, is the absence, or poor application, of a red sealant ring around (and slightly onto) the primer.\r\n\r\nAny ammunition marked "L12A1" is either a forgery or stolen, since HP produces it exclusively for British MOD.\r\n\r\nThe only other manufacturers of "SMG" ammunition (to my knowledge) are:\r\n\r\nIsrael Military Industries (IMI), who produce the ammunition packaged in either plain brown boxes or boxes with the " UZI " logo. These rounds are black-tipped, but the black tip designates them only as high-pressure, not specifically as SMG rounds; and\r\n\r\nRemington, who have produced a 9mm SMG round loaded with a standard JHP (not Golden Saber) bullet. Any company advertising Remington SMG Golden Sabre rounds is falsely advertising.\r\n\r\nNote that Remington only produces the SMG rounds on a per-request basis, and only for government agencies. Likewise, IMI produces the SMG ammunition rarely (mostly for Israeli and American military contracts) and very few samples of it are in circulation in the US, mostly in the hands of collectors.\r\n\r\nSMG-specific rounds are NOT SAFE to fire in any handgun. There are a few handguns designs which can tolerate it SPARINGLY, but I do not recommend this practice. Remember, the SAAMI maximum chamber pressure for 9mm +P rounds is 38,500 PSI, and the NATO maximum chamber pressure for small arms, including rifles, is 50,000 PSI. SMG-specific rounds meet or exceed the 50,000 PSI mark.\r\n\r\nNote also that SMG rounds are likewise unsafe to fire in many submachineguns, and virtually all pistol-cartridge carbines, since both are usually engineered for 9mm pistol ammunition. Only a very few models of carbines and submachine guns are suitable for firing the ammunition in; if in doubt, contact the manufacturer and ask them about the use of L7A1 ammunition in their guns."\r\n\r\nFound this info on the net.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.uzitalk.com/forums/showthread.php?66853-Any-L7A1-Ammo-Still-Around[/url][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nTHIS IS .32 Hirtenberger HP packing:\r\n[IMG][IMG]http://i1063.photobucket.com/albums/t511/gunfreak2/09c2ed49.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]', 1, 0, '119.160.10.222', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Since I have all but given up hope of getting my hands on a used CF 98. I have now turned my attentions on  local copies.  (I will be sharing a detailed review on local handguns later on)\r\nFirst port of call:\r\n\r\n[b]Javed Armoury[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\nWillys 52 told me about this dealer and I decided to check him out. He had a Zigana F asking 28k and a local Betty clone asking 24k. His Zigana sport looked so like the real thing that I mistook it for an original turk. He informed me that iwas a clone and he was asking for 24k for it. The local betty (matt black) looked nice but he said Zafar-Alam betties wil be coming in the next lot a few weeks later. \r\n\r\nI made a mental note to visit him but I am really not sure if it would be Zafar alam or just another gun that he would claim is a zafar alam.. (After I had expressed my interest in the betty in the window  he said it’s a made-to-order) weapon.)\r\n\r\nI then turned my attention too the AK lookalike shotguns in the market. They looked pretty well made asking price was 24k.. So I looked around some more and he got a tad frustrated. Aap ko lena kia hai (What is it that you want to buy) I guess I was behaving a bit like Ahmed 82 here.  And I know how annoying that can be.. So I left. \r\n\r\nBut in the imortal words of Arnold SWhaz-whatisname “I will be back” No wait. I guess that was General Eisenhower.\r\n\r\n[b]Five Star Arms Company..[/b]\r\n\r\nThis chap showed me a betty clone for 25k and said he will give a lifetime warranty for its barrel. Claiming it wlil not explode. However if its barrel were to explode then the warranty would be the last thing on my mind since I will have other more important things to worry about, therefore I did not give it much thought. He had no idea who had made it though.  Also showed me the Ziggy sports. But refused to tell me the price. He had figured out that I had been doing the rounds of the market and wanted to know what I had been offered.  (If he wanted to know what his competitors were selling he should do it the old fashioned way and get himself a spy). He said he does not do any paperwork. Which means I have to run around and get the weapon registered and try and get a 144 permit on my own.  When I dared ask about the shotguns he plucked the Ziggy from my hand, put away the box and immersed himself in paperwork. I realized I should go. \r\nI left.\r\n\r\nNext day I went to the market with fellow members Zaheer and Usama. And I would request them to add anything that I might have missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe met up at [b]Pioneer Arms[/b] Lucky Star Branch. While they were busy talking to Adeel Bhai I was oogling the display case. It has A Glock, A Cf 98, a few ziggies and betties and a sigma along with other goodies.. I got a proper shock when deel Bhai told me they were all copies.. Copies they may be but pretty neat ones. Asking price for most of em were 24k or there about. However Adeel bhai told me that I should not trust the decockers of local weapons. \r\n\r\n[b]Next we all went to Shangai Arms:[/b]\r\n\r\nWe had an interesting chat with Irfan bhai the dealer there. He did not have much to show except some really really neat Shotguns and a few TTs. He also said that new stock will be coming in the next few weeks. He had a Yes an HONEST-TO-GOODNESS Veper 12 MOLOT Clone. At last a  Vepr at an affordable price. So far the only one in the market.   They checked out a few other pieces but heck.. The world tends to lose focus when I cradle a Vepr in my arms. \r\nIt was a prototype though which is why he did not have any more of em around.. And as such the display piece. Unlike the Ak-47s and some werd shapes that I have never seen before that were going for 17k final  he offered the vepr for 20k. He could see how difficult it was for me to put her down.  His version of the Vepr had small accessory rails on both the sides as well. I saw  a drum mag with a capacity of 12 rounds. He told me that yes it can be modified to fit the Vepr. He said that he will take my shotgun as a gift if I buy the Vepr without paying anything for it. I do not like giving gifts to people I don’t know.\r\nAnother person I will definitely be visiting once his fresh stock comes though.\r\n\r\nWe then left for Zaheer Bhai’s home. Where he showed us the rest of his arsenal and treated us to some scrumptious samosas and rolls. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot Zaheer bhai! \r\n\r\nAfterwards,  we left for Usama’s placefor a cup of Tea where he ‘cured’ me of my near pathological terror of all handguns without external decockers courtesy his CZ P07 Duty.  I now think that guns without decockers are neat too. Just not as neat as guns with decockers. \r\nAfterwards, when I was leaving we found to our consternation that I had a flat tire. And my Jack was lost. I would have been in a pretty pickle indeed had Usama Bhai not helped me procure one and indeed helped changed the tire in spite of his bad back. \r\n\r\nThree Cheers for Usama Bhai.

In such kind of tunes, some better made springs and guides than OEM spring and guieds are fitted.  \n\nThem smoothes the short cycle.

But here it will become too long story.\n\nI dont have the chrono to measure FPS.  One I got it from a friend for a few days.  But now I dont have.  Neither I can afford to purchase it right now.\n\nProper measuring of FPS can only be done through chrono.

Secondly lot of different types of Bretta clone and there is no such thing as first or second genration in Bretta clones. \n\nYes you can change your weapon on your license as many times as you want but you have to get it register at arms branch every time you sell your old weapon and buy the new one. Although its a easy process to do so on booklet license and very very hard and hectic process on MOI card license.\n\nYou can apply for as many licenses as yo want, as the license from Islamabad is under Nadra now it will take a little time even if you get the approval in no time.\n\nLastly if you are still interested in the Bretta clone here is the link that will give you all the details\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?78-Pakistani-Beretta-Clone-(Detailed-Pictures)&highlight=Bretta+92fs+clone[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nThanx dear, how much is cf98 ? is it original in local market ?\n\n[QUOTE=Trigger_happy78;294792]Welcome to Pakguns bro. Ok i don''t have much experience with beretta clone. I don''t like local clones, i think they''re dangerous, and that''s what i''ll advise you too. But if you do want one only look for Beretta 92fs clone made by POF. There is a review of it here. As Laino bro suggested go for a CF98 instead. 2)You can change your weapon on the lic as many times as you want.\n3) The effective range of Original 92FS is well above 50M, but the effective range of the clones depends on the quality of the barrel. \n4) You can apply for as many lic as you want.

Both the guards will be civil with a local TT or pump action. You can get exarmed forces guards, ssg even with imported weapons also. It all depends on how much one wants to spend.\nPersonal speaking I trust myself only when it comes to security; while keeping a low profile having my own gun with 144 permit would do the job. Hiring a guard is like exposing yourself to danger. Once you hire the guards you will have to keep them because you have already exposed yourself. This SHUSHKA is not good at all, it in fact is a very dangerous thing to do.\nI also agree to my brothers that in majority of the cases guards are untrained. \nTo me an untrained guard armed with weapon himself is a security threat. Unfortunately what the Govt doesn''t realize is that security has become an industry. Everywhere in the civilized world verification of individuals/citizens is state''s responsibility. There are numerous issues those need to be addressed by the Govt which effects the end user directly.\nJust see for yourself we at least have a medical, theory and a practical test to get a driving license but don''t have to pass any exam to get a WEAPON license.

First zeroed at about 30 meters with Armscor Subsonic that gave one inch above the bull at 80 meters with Armscor high velocity ammo. So, the rifle was fine-tuned at 80 meters with Armscor High Velocity at the bull.

Maybe i lack vision , but the only part of the story that made an impact on me was the Humble way of Life of Prophet (PBUH ), which even though we hv been told of many time, i personally keep forgetting and End up indulging myself in this Rat race Of Money/material posessions = happiness.\r\n\r\n2. Certain things abt this story i can''t digest :[b]All of these are directed at the reporter of this Udru Piece which was originally published in Urdu Times, Mumbai, as far as my limited internet search could tell me. [/b] \r\n\r\nThis Article includes No names Of the Author''s Or Reporter''s or references to source material. Credibility? \r\n\r\nNow lets get something Straight : This Article seems to suggest that Isreal , a country, whose neighbours had a stated Aim to remove it from the world map , was discussing whether or Not to buy arms ? had already fought 3 wars with those same countries, and needed convincing to buy weapons ? sounds totally reasonable to me (not)\r\n\r\nThe American resupplying Effort in that war was partly AID, not bought as suggested by the article.\r\nFor reference : the actual issue wasnt Whether or not to buy weapons:\r\n[url]http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/9565.html[/url]\r\nEarly on Yom Kippur day, in the hours between the Mossad&#8217;s war alert and the actual outbreak of fighting, Golda Meir, who admitted that she did not know what a division was, had to make two critical military decisions. Her major military advisors, Defense Minister Dayan, Israel''s most prominent war hero, and Chief of Staff Gen. David Elazar, disagreed with each other over whether Israel should launch a pre-emptive air attack against the Arab forces and whether it should order a general mobilization of all its reserves. Elazar proposed both these moves. Dayan, who was still not convinced the Arabs would attack, rejected them. The two battle-scarred generals left it the 75-year-old grandmother to decide between them. Falling back on common sense and political instincts, she backed Elazar on full mobilization and backed Dayan in ruling out a pre-emptive strike. The Americans, she noted, opposed pre-emptive strikes and Israel might be needing American materiel and political support, she said. Retrospectively, both her decisions proved correct. Although visibly pained by the high casualties, she bore up well during the war. She let her generals manage the fighting but whenever her intervention was needed her judgement proved sound.\r\n\r\nThen-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger later confirmed Meir''s assessment by stating that if Israel had launched a pre-emptive strike, Israel would not have received "so much as a nail".\r\n\r\nSimilarly the article suggests she said this : Your doubt are well founded, but if we win this war, and defeat the Arabs, history will remember us as the victors, and in history, once a community is know as the victor, it forgets how many eggs they ate and how many times they had food. Whether there was jam, honey, butter on the table, and how many holes they had in their shoes. Or whether the sheaths of their swords were new or old!

Maybe some1 can help me understand.[/QUOTE]\n\nAgree. We need to check the authenticity/veracity of what is narrated. At times, people have even made up ahaadeeth to suit their own purposes. We should be wary of that and cite sources (and context) when narrating something as important as hadeeth or an element of sunna''.\n\nFurther, even if upon investigation we come to the conclusion that what is stated is, indeed, correct, we need to examine things in their context. What the prophet said and did has to be considered in context (and, not in isolation) in order to draw lessons for ourselves.\n\nThe lessons that I draw (and there may be many others) from the quoted narrative is that the Holy Prophet (SAWS) lived a simple life. That he did not consider it appropriate to accumulate wealth and, therefore, had few possessions (amongst which were his weapons).\n\nHowever, the fact that he had few possessions and that his weapons were amongst those few possessions, should not be taken as an automatic affirmation of the (and, here I am borrowing from macroeconomic theory) "guns versus butter model". \n\nThe Holy Prophet (SAWS), through what he said and how he lived his life, in addition to other things, also underscored the importance of feeding the poor and educating ourselves. \n\nSo, yes, indeed, defense has to be catered to but, equally, we must educate our children, provide health facilities to care for the sick, and feed our poor. \n\nAnd, to understand things we must look at religion and the examples set by the Holy Prophet (SAWS) in totality rather than taking isolated incidents or quotations (i) without investigation and (ii) without context.\n\nThere are other things to note here, as well. From what we see on TV (of Arab and our own rulers'' lifestyles), and from what is narrated in the Golda Meir story, it seems that Golda Meir lived more simply (for e.g., she made tea for her visitor, herself) than the followers of the Holy Prophet (SAWS). \n\nAlso, if the story is true, then we must appreciate Golda Meir''s propensity to learn good things even from those she disagreed with in terms of religious beliefs. And, we may consider the following excerpt from a Forbes magazine article ([URL]http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/05/india-higher-education-oped-cx_prg_0813education.html[/URL]) to assess if there may be something we could learn from Israel in terms of the importance of education and the fact that they did not choose guns over all else but also gave education top priority:\nQUOTE\nIndia''s real infrastructure problem--with no solution in sight--is not airports or electricity; it is the virtual nonexistence of graduate education and research in information and other crucial technologies. Consider this for starters: The U.S. produces about 1,400 Ph.D.s in computer science annually and China about 3,000. By stark comparison, India''s annual computer science Ph.D. production languishes at roughly 40. That number is about the same as that for Israel, a nation with roughly 5% of India''s population size. \nUNQUOTE \nLastly, some less illustrious proponents of "guns versus butter" - just to give us all some fruit for thought:\n\nIn a speech on January 17, 1936, Minister of Propaganda [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels"]Joseph Goebbels[/URL] stated: "We can do without butter, but, despite all our love of peace, not without arms. One cannot shoot with butter, but with guns." Sometime in the summer of the same year, [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring"]Hermann Göring[/URL] announced in a speech, "Guns will make us powerful; butter will only make us fat."\n\nSo, in conclusion, I would humbly suggest that we discuss weapons and weapons related stuff on Pakguns and avoid subjects, which may be perfectly good subjects to discuss elsewhere, but which may detract from the specific purpose and objectives of this site. Religion and politics are very important parts of our lives but there is a time and place for everything. Feel free to start a new forum (the domain [URL="http://www.Paklives.com"]www.Paklives.com[/URL] is already taken, though) but, if you wish to avoid sermons from me, pls stick to the objectives of Pakguns on this forum :-) \n\nWa''assalam', 1, 0, '116.71.49.22', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(296207, 9688, 0, 'Moeen', 704, 'CARACAL CARACAL CARACAL F Review/Project...', 1347004640, 'Salam All,\n \nCaracal, Caracal, Caracal is all I have been hearing lately from everyone.  Then here on PG a new thread called the Caracal Club...  I had seen and checked out this gun about three to four years ago.  The so called official agents for Caracal then wanted somewhere in the neighborhood of about 3500/usd for a piece.  I laughed and stated to them back then - its not a Glock and nor will it ever be.  Sooo, having said that should the next logical statement be that the gun is no good?  Absolutely not, it is a great gun, its ergonomic grip feel is better than most.  The trigger though smooth initially has a longer take to ignition than some others but then those some others out there in the market were imported with high powered springs.  Anyways, I am not going to dwell on whose better. \n \nA while back I was bored with nothing to do so I decided to make this Caracal F my project.  I wanted to go out and buy and then see what all the hype is really about.  Why the Caracal F?  I have always been a fan of full size pistols.  Anyone will tell you that in SD or for sporting purpose world - size matters.  Caracal F in my opinion is small enough as is and there shouldn''t be a need to go smaller.  I can holster and hide the Caracal well as I can many other handguns with ease hence I am Big & Sexy... lolz.\n \nAfter two days of ownership and dry firing, I realized that the trigger on Caracal can be made better and more smoother.  I started to search out You Tube websites to see if there have been any dis-assembly videos done on this gun, I found one but not too detailed.  I did pay attention to the parts in the video which stated that some items need to be installed properly for working.\n \nI also noticed that I didn''t like the rear sight set-up.  This has been my biggest peeve with this gun.  I don''t like being told that this is it about anything, I like options.  And when it comes to sights, there should always be options.  So the rear sight had to go.  So what sight should go on it as there are no custom sight manufacturers out there who make stuff for this gun?  Although, accurate, its a combat gun, if Caracal manufactured a sports version then an adjustable sight would be perfect; however, this is meant for combat and  a fixed sight will have to suffice.  I decided on a clear-wide/deep notch fixed sight.  Why?  As one starts to age, the vision also goes, that so called "I can see the target, front sight and the rear sight clearly at the same time" also begins to deteriorate.  A person can only focus on one thing at a time and when we are young, our focus on these three things is very quick giving the impression that everything is seen clearly.  As we age, this back and forth focus slows down.  This is why we are told to always leave the target and the rear sight blurred and focus only on the front sight.  Also the light bars one see between the front and rear sight need to be more pronounced.  Most combat guns don''t have the clear light bars, most competition guns do whether its for fast shooting or for target shooting.  I needed to address this issue for me.\n \nLastly, I wanted to work on the grip.  I am wondering why with all the funding Caracal has over any other company(s) who all started out small - would they make a grip which has the same problem as most other polymer guns out there...  traction on the grip.  In humid climates, the hand slips and slides.  I see many at the range re-adjusting their hand/grip after each shot.  There are many option(s) (textures) this company could have and should have chosen to make the grip texture more aggressive meaning anti-slip.\n \nHmmm, what else?  Well, nothing, Caracal is a great gun and there is nothing else for the average user to worry about or dwell over.  I wish there where more options for Caracal not only in production but also in parts accessories.  I guess all is due in time.  The lines are very rounded and lean giving it a nice look and feel.\n \nI couldn''t wait anymore for the right day so on the fourth day of ownership, I decided to go ahead and take the slide apart.  After three hours or so, I decided to proceed and work on the frame parts... including the grip.  I was done with the slide, frame and grip by about 2am.  The sight work required milling and was a task for another day.  The trigger was tried out the very next day as I couldn''t wait.  Glockcohlic was there, and saw me shoot plates over and over again, single handed, at 25 meters.  Yes, that last sentence is correct.  Aside from that, I had three instances where the gun had FTF, that problem was solved by polishing the inner lips of the magazine towers.\n \nCaracal is a great gun.  It should not be compared with other guns.  Just like other guns its trying to find its own place in the market.  If it was made just like a Glock or S&W or a better example is the 1911, then and only then would you compare it to the other.  I was thinking about doing a proper shootout between a first gen Glock and the Caracal F for comparison but after going through it realized its not necessary, one cannot compare apples to oranges - those who think they can should visit me for a lecture.\n \nUAE has come up with a good concept.  I would like to see them add to it.  There should be a longer slide model with adjustable sights (plain black).  It would be great to see a Compensator target model.  I would like to see the trigger safety changed - its the same as Glock... wobbly.  It should have been more like the Steyr M9 design - thick as like the custom triggers offered for Glock to eliminate play.  I know its originally designed to be a strict combat pistol but I am not talking about the Caracal F now I am talking about the theoretical models which if made CAN and WILL exceed in civilian sales over military sales.  Certain items need to go as there is no need for them as I say they are just gimmicks and they are the cocked indicator and the color coding grip strip.  Caracal also does need to update their service quality, I sent them an email over two months ago regarding a part and have yet to receive a reply.   Yet again, I will state its a great gun.\n \nOkay, my hand are now hurting, its been a looong time since I typed so much at one time.  I will let my video and pictures do the teaching/talking.  I apologize for the poor picture quality thanks to I phone.  AND if anyone at Caracal management does see my video and likes it - I would like to have them send me TWO fiber optic front sights as gift along with those nice black Caracal logo t-shirts (xxl please), my email address is [EMAIL="paradigms67@hotmail.com"]paradigms67@hotmail.com[/EMAIL] for further correspondence... lolz.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1001.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1012.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[video=youtube_share;ei6-1Sqb1rI]http://youtu.be/ei6-1Sqb1rI[/video]', 1, 1, '115.186.153.239', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Following  may be interesting for you.\n\nRegards,\n\nUmair Bhaur\n[B]\n\nFollowing is an extract from one of my American expert with some modifications[/B]\n\nRam driven rifles can be good hunters. \n\nThey normally do not achieve the reliability, consistency and accuracy a good  metal-springed gun can.  \n\nThere are TOO MANY variables in the shot cycle when using several  O Rings, one valve, and lubricants that are "finicky" with temperature  and pressure. \n\nJust feel the difference  between summer and winter?\n\nSo taking a few shots now and then (as in hunting or  plinking) is OK. Taking 10,000 to 30,000 shots per year is a no-no for gas ram. \n\nIf a metal spring breaks you  usually get some reduction of power, some sounds tell you that something  is wrong, but you can still shoot. When a Ram dies, that''s it. It  is a catastrophical failure. Some of them may be re-built, but not all  of them. Many die overnight. \n\nIF you have a rammed  rifle in your collection of 5 or more  airguns and you use it more or less regularly for hunting or plinking,  they are OK. \n\nIf you shoot ONLY ONE gun, then you''re better off with a steel-springed rifle. \n\n[B]From an other airgunner[/B]\n\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]I had one in a  Patriot for a time. I prefer the coil spring over the ram if you are  willing to tune the gun. The ram is a tune in a box as far the spring  goes. You will still get forward recoil just no buzz just a solid thunk.  They will not give you a velocity increase. They are also quite  expensive and they do need replacement after a time. Mine leaked down  after about 5 years[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]\n\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3][B]extract from one of my American expert with some modifications[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]Gas Rams, Gas  Springs and Gas Struts are all the same. Some of them are Air/Gas shock  absorbers, so they will have a controlled leak in them with the spring  and the means to return to stable operation after a while. \n\nWe need to remember that the first TRULY SUCCESSFUL Gas Ram was made in  Argentina, some 25-27 years ago and that it was only Theoben''s bullying  (in no small measure aided by the Falklands War outcome) that got the  Argentinians to stop making their version. \n\nSo, they have been here for a long time. \n\nWhat is different now are the materials. Seals are better, shafts are  better, lubricants are better, gases are more controlled. So that makes a  difference. And, if anything, that is what is truly patentable. Most  other aspects wouldn''t stand a chance in an international patent court. \n\nYou also need to ALWAYS bear in mind that 90% of the airguns sold, get  used a few times when they are new and then get put away and not used  for a substantial amount of time. Sometimes decades. VERY VERY VERY few  really get used the way we use ours. So manufacturers also bank on that.  Something may fail, but only when used and by then the warranty will  have expired or the paperwork lost. \n\nThere are commercial GasSprings manufacturers that make GasRams suitable  for most airguns [U][B]without a center stem. OUR problem with the Diana  layout is that all pistons, to my knowledge, have a center stem and it  is very difficult to make a Reliable, Hollow, Gas Ram. I am not saying  it is impossible, just very difficult. But, who knows?[/B][/U] it MAY be just  around the corner. \n\nGas Rams have a "novelty" factor. They also have a marketing behind  them. Who has read of the new silicone steel wires that are now used in  the metal spring''ed guns? I bet that only a handful. And what about  the newer and even better materials? Some of them even having Niobium,  Aluminum, Copper, Molybdenum, Vanadium and even rare earths as minute  percentages in their alloys? \nWe can now alloy steel with things that would not have dreamed of a decade ago. \n\nPersonally, having owned a few Gas-Rammed rifles, I would not go back to  them. They are hard to cock, they are not reliable, they are not  efficient (A Diana-52 needed 45# of cocking effort instead of the 35# that  it requires with a metal spring to provide the same Muzzle Energy; An RX-2 needed  controlling and re-filling to get back to specs every quarter). So, I do  not see a reason for them. The "leave it cocked crowd" can certainly  have my sympathies and my best encouragement to improve on their  field-craft. But, not for me, thanks.  \n\nFor NOW. \n\nAs materials get more advanced and as mechanizing and fitting become  more and more perfect, I may still find someone to make a GOOD Gas Ram. \n\n\n\n\n\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=Arial][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT]', 1, 0, '182.178.116.129', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But I think when You got a good Spot For partridges, Ducks Ect...... Than You Can Get good Bag Even With Desi Guns Or Sunshine Cartridges Too. I have believe In It. Actually In My Opinion True Hunting sports Guns Are S*S or over Under. Still A large Numbers of Good hunters In Europe Specially Like to Shoot Birds With Fix Chokes Side By Side or Over Under. Even Bretta Auto Loaders mother Land is In Europe. USA Is The Country Where Most common Wing shootings guns are Auto loaders.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nMasroor sb, u r lucky indeed to have seen those kind of waterfowl waves back in 1988 and around. Since when have these birds become this scanty as we see nowadays during migration especially. \r\n\r\nMigration times should not affect those waves as all ducks HAVE to pass our routes and then reach Sind waters....BUT this does not happen now. Now either too high flights are seen passing over your blinds or, few days (very few) available for those ideal duck migration and decoying. By that, I don''t mean no duck shooting opportunity now... I have had some really good shooting myself in the last few years including last season too, but, situations are quite competitive and dicey now... DICEY meaning they can shift either way anytime unexpectedly - in b/w khawari & a good shoot.\r\n\r\nYes, reason for autoloaders in USA is: steel shot and magnum etc cartrgs for waterfowling, & even turkey hunting. Thats where the real advantage of repeater is. Europeans are as I know more into upland, grouse, quail, pheasant. In USA there is a duck/geese craze both which require semis. No harm with semis actually. But the pleasure of shooting a classic SxS English for example with fixed (say 1/4 & 1/2) chokes and double trigger is matchless. But Masroor sb, who will pay 10 lacs plus for such guns nowadays and go into hunting areas which have additional security problem always. These classic guns are beyond one''s budget in general, if bought new. Majority in use are inherited by hunters from their seniors. So the world is shifting to practicality & economies of scale with soaring labor costs and that has a certain cost to it. Even in England and Europe, these so called classics (SxS, NIB) are afforded by Lords/Nobility there, not the commoner. But then there is another issue ....What is the weapon one is so used to firing since childhood? You would have been using a SxS since start probably. I have been using for example autoloaders since start (Remington 1100 at early age, then Ber A303 & then Teknys)... How can a person so used to the feel of a single sighting plane since childhood, suddenly adapt to double guns such as SxS even if he does. So, there is another angle to it too.\r\n\r\nAlso, the gunfit issue??? SxS or O/U unless properly fitted to a shooter especially LOP/DAC/DAH/Cast...will create problems with one''s shooting espec at flushing game which essentially requires the perfect gunfit. Aya#4 or Aya#2 e.g. have a certain fixed dimensions. Except the LOP, nothing can be changed whereas majority of repeaters have shims etc for that purpose. So, not every classic SxS even if available at a good price will fit perfectly too. Thats a real problem. \r\n\r\nIf one is looking for a classic SxS (European/English) with fixed chokes (1/4 & 1/2), sidelock or boxlock, ejector, NIB or slightly used mint condition, 26" or 28" barrel, neutral balance or slight fwd weight bias, LOP 14.25", Cast Off 1/4", DAC 1.5", DAH 2.4-2.5", weight 6.25-6.75 lbs at a reasonable price, what are the options for a shooter?', 1, 0, '110.36.199.128', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Sounds very frustrating but I know the score back home aswell. Talking about the UK, I actually work for the world''s biggest and a globally established security firm. Instead of disclosing my role or going into too much details lets talk about the Security Officers and Security Industry in the UK in general.\n\n People working within the Security Industry in the UK must go through very strict screening and vetting process. Anybody applying for a job must do proper training in order to obtain a Security Industry Authority Licence or known as the "SIA License", and then there are different types of that License each individual has to do the appropriate training according to their roles they wish to undertake etc. The training for the SIA License entails different units which are taught during the course and one must pass atleast 4 solid exams in order to obtain an SIA License. The main units contain topics like, UK Security Laws and regulations, other related Laws, Conflict Management, Physical Intervention/ Self Defence, Different types of equipments I.e types of Fire Extinguishers and Fires, Chemicals, Maunual Handling, Types and Methods of Communications etc. \n\n A CRB check or a Criminial Record Buereu is also a must requirement. This is to check their previous criminal record or history. Any one that has any previous criminal convictions are often denied an SIA License, depending on the nature of offence and how long ago it took place. One of my friends who went to school with me had a conviction for ABH (Actual Bodily Harm) but was stil granted a license because the offence took place when he was a young teenager and still at school so It was just a school fight but now he is a responsible grown up and since then has never been in trouble with the Law. but incase of any serious offences like Robberies, Burglaries, Rape etc, one will not get an SIA license. \n\nOnce the SIA License is granted they can then start applying for jobs. When a company for example our company is interested in you after reveiwing your application you ar then called for a properface to face interview where you are grilled with many different questions and scenarios by asking things like what would you do in this situation that situation, or how would you handle a situation where your colleague might be under attack or their might be an emergency etc. Then customer handling questions, Cummunication Skills both written and verbal, Role Plays daccording to different circumstances and situations, Smell Test (where they make you smell a lemony smelling object and something else and ask you which one was what, they do that so they know when you are working somewhere on a site and incase if there is a gas leak or fire smoke so you can notice it imediately, Data Protection Act questions etc and many more are asked. There are sometimes hundreds of candidates and only 1 or 2 positions but you have to fight your way in and then they only select the one who they think is the most suitable for the role taking their previous experiences into account. \n\nAfter the interview their previous record is checked via a CRB check or a  (Criminal Record Bureu), also all your previous employers are contacted for previous employment reference. You then also need to give two prsonal references outside work too and have to put down all the previous addresses you had lived at during the past 5 to 10 years. Once you are successful you receive a phone call or a letter informing you of the interview outcome and folowed by a contract to sign and send back via the post and an induction day is also arranged. Then once you start work further training takes place and the first 6 months is your probation period where your learning skills the way you do your duties, customer service skills and punctuality etc is closely monitored, should they not be happy with you, the probation can be extended for another 3 months, If you improve you are made permanent, if not then its a hand shake and bye bye. \n\nA regular criminal check is carried out on all workers each year, and if you are convicted of any offences outside work you will stil lose your job even if that had nothing to do with your job or work place but because of the fact you now have a criminal record they still dont want you no more. It happend a colleague of mine 2 weeks ago. A fight outside work or whatever it was took place 2 years ago and he must have been charged/ convicted but he kept quiet about it so he did get away with it for a year or two but a recent CRB check during his promotion revealed that incident so he lost his SIA licence hence the job too but when you loose your license you can no longer work for any security industry in the UK. \n\nThis is what a British (Security Industry Authority) License looks like.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]12427[/ATTACH]\n\nAll Security Officers in our company have to be First Aid Trained. Our Training First Aid Certificate is valid for 3 years, after 3 years you are sent for a refresher or a renewal course to Warrington or Glasgow, you get put in the Holiday inn hotel or other top class hotels for 4 Days all inclusive, incl your travel cost, meals, taxies breakfasts everything. The First Aid Training is quiet intensed you do non stop role plays on dummy patients I.e giving them CPR''s, Using Defiblerators, practise bandage techniques to use on heavily bleeding casualties or dealing with imputated body parts, shock treatments, calling for help or emergency services etc. There is also an exam at the end of the course which you to pass. You only get two chances, If you fail twice you fail the course and then you can no longer continue to do the job that you are doing as you have to be First Trained so you automatically lose your job too. \n\nYou also get physical intervention training when training for the SIA License but UK Security Officer or even the Police Officers dont carry any guns. Except the Armed Response Unit, they only come when there is a need for it I.e if the attacker has a gun or an offensive weapon like a sword etc. No TT''s or Pumps are given to any one working within the Security Industry in the UK.', 1, 0, '90.193.158.136', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nThey continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one evening when they''re driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: "Roger, do you realize that, as of tonight, we''ve been seeing each other for exactly six months?"\r\n\r\nAnd then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he''s been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I''m trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn''t want, or isn''t sure of.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months.\r\n\r\nAnd Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I''m not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I''d have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward ...I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: ...so that means it was ...let''s see ...February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer''s, which means ...lemme check the odometer ...Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here...\r\n\r\nAnd Elaine is thinking: He''s upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I''m reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that''s it. That''s why he''s so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He''s afraid of being rejected.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: And I''m gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don''t care what those morons say, it''s still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It''s 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a goddamn garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600. \r\n\r\nAnd Elaine is thinking: He''s angry. And I don''t blame him. I''d be angry, too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can''t help the way I feel. I''m just not sure.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: They''ll probably say it''s only a 90-day warranty. That''s exactly what they''re gonna say, the scumballs. \r\n\r\nAnd Elaine is thinking: Maybe I''m just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I''m sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty I''ll give them a damn warranty. I''ll take their warranty and stick it right up their ....\r\n\r\n"Roger," Elaine says aloud.\r\n\r\n"What?" asks Roger, startled.\r\n\r\n"Please don''t torture yourself like this," she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. "Maybe I should never have ...Oh God, I feel so....." (She breaks down, sobbing.)\r\n\r\n"What?" says Roger, totally perplexed.\r\n\r\n"I''m such a fool," Elaine sobs. "I mean, I know there''s no knight. I really know that. It''s silly. There''s no knight, and there''s no horse."\r\n\r\n"There''s no horse?" says Roger.\r\n\r\n"You think I''m a fool, don''t you?" Elaine says.\r\n\r\n"No!" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.\r\n\r\n"It''s just that ...It''s that I ...I need some time," Elaine says.\r\n\r\n(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) "Yes," he says.\r\n\r\n(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) "Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?" she says.\r\n\r\n"What way?" says Roger.\r\n\r\n"That way about time," says Elaine.\r\n\r\n"Oh," says Roger. Still hoping he''s on the right track he responds, "Yes."\r\n\r\n(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Roger," Elaine says.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," says Roger.\r\n\r\nThen he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it''s better if he doesn''t think about it. (This is also Roger''s policy regarding world hunger.)\r\n\r\nThe next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine''s, will pause just before serving, frown, and ask: "Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?"', 1, 0, '76.125.99.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Made some mistakes too. Many new ideas & concepts crossed my mind as well.\n \nWhat I learnt during the due course was, it is always practical, efficient & economical to use a bone stock vehicle without any modification for restoration, modification or upgrade projects. As, the vehicles dimensions are not tempered with. Main body structure & frame stands in their original lines. Therefore, balancing body panels while denting & putting bolt-on components, may it be original parts, body panels or aftermarket (vehicle specific) accessories is a piece of cake.\n \nThe vehicle mentioned above that went thru some modifications & upgrades already would have been a sheer waste of time & money spent already on that machine.\n \nHence I decided to get a stock & unaltered vehicle in genuine condition. Where to find one? Yup, the Pakistan Army auctions. As we know, they are the least used, least abused & absolutely unaltered vehicles available here. Even after almost 3 decades in service, the structural & design integrity of these vehicles is just perfect. Except those that get involved in accidents and are rare cases.\n \nSo, in quest of finding a better specimen for resto-mod, I ended up buying three auctioned FJ40 over a period of few months. By the time, the work on the first one had already started and the third being the best in condition, I sold out the 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] vehicle as it was.\n \nPlan was to restore one of the vehicles to absolutely factory specs and make it look as close stock as possible. That would have been my prized vehicle (like a collection thing) as I love this shape. But while it was taking shape, my uncle (father-in-law as well) requested (ordered) that vehicle to be transferred to his possession as he also likes them very much. Though I knew he will never drive it as I wouldn&#8217;t have, and it proved true later on, I had to give it away. Now it stands in his garage covered.\n \nThe second vehicle was my hobby vehicle and I had some plans queued for it. So, eventually build-up process of both vehicles started somewhere in 2011.\n \nI have summarized most background details that are scattered on different built threads on Pakwheels & IJC for my dear fellow readers.\n \nHere is the link to the 1[SUP]st[/SUP] vehicle build-up that is in stock specs. :\n \n[URL="http://www.pakwheels.com/forums/4x4-clubs-off-roaders-suv/152067-2-more-fj-40s"]Pakwheels &#8211; 2 more fj 40s[/URL]\n\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]12463[/ATTACH]\n\n\nAnd here is the one for my favorite Trail Cruiser:\n \n[URL="http://www.pakwheels.com/forums/4x4-clubs-off-roaders-suv/172676-toyota-fj40-trail-cruiser-build-up"]Pakwheels &#8211; Toyota FJ40 Trail Cruiser Build-up[/URL]\n\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]12464[/ATTACH]\n[I][B]Sincere note[/B]: This is the best time to get hands on auctioned Toyota Land Cruiser 40 series vehicles as most or all of them have been auctioned by Pakistan Army & because of abundant supply of them in the market, the prices & choices are at their best.

As Gamo stamps they''re name on Chinese scopes they get good ones of invariant quality as even Al Sayad sells them.

It is so good that there is no need of much amendment so I reproduce some part of it.\n\n[U]"Open rear sights came into use centuries ago. Nothing fancy -  just a spring steel ramp with a sliding stepper to elevate or lower the  common V/U opening. The only usable/meaningful improvement was a slider  ramp with about twenty graduations for indication of elevation setting -  not a precise mechanism, in most cases requiring a screwdriver for  adjustment.\n \nCompetition shooters have long known the benefits that peep sights offer  - refined adjustment of 1/4 MOA (1/4 inch at 100 yrds) or even finer  adjustment capability. Add to this the even more important necessity -  repeatability. You can move the elevation/windage knobs up and down and  be able to come back to the original setting, if needed. This  exceptional benefits is derived from the fact that these sights are the  micrometer-type, based on precisely threaded screws that are used to  move the elevation and windage directions. Repeatability of of this  level is not available in optical sights - no matter if they cost  thousands of dollars. You can have the optical manufacturers claim  debunked by asking if their elevation/windage is based on precise  threaded screws.\n \nOpen sights require alignment of rear sight to the front sight and both  sights in turn to the target. With peep sight you only need to align the  front sight to the target and pull the trigger. With a peep sight, the  eye instinctively centers itself in the peep hole - thus requiring only  the alignment of the front sight to the target.\n \nMany rifles come drilled and tapped to accept commercial peep sights.  Sights are also available for receiver bases that are customarily used  for mounting optical sights. Over the years I have used Lyman and  Williams peep sights with delight. Try a rifle with peep sight. Shift  the elevation/windage knob just one click and see the resulting minute  impact point movement on the target. You will be impressed what a peep  sight has to offer."[/U]\n\nBased on my personal experience, I recommend all those airgunners who do not have access to good airgun rated scopes to use peep sights.  \n\nYou really do not need to purchase expensive peeps rather you can make home made peep in just a few hundred rupees.\n\nIt will give you consistantly the accuracy which a 3x to 4x scope can give.\n\nHere are some pics for your interest.[ATTACH=CONFIG]12473[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]12474[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]12473[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]12474[/ATTACH]\n\nRegards,\n\nUmair Bhaur', 1, 0, '119.154.98.229', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If its a .22lr it may last longer. \n\nAirguns have the worst recoil for any scope and any scope which is not airgun rated is bound to damage no matter how expensive it may be (I''ve read people destroying their leupolds, redfield and bushnells etc on an airgun, especially diana airguns).\n\nDid you mount the rings/base correctly? They need to be well aligned and both of the same shape and size so the scope is perfectly fitted.\n\nDid you at any point turned the elevation knob to either of its extremes, and shot a couple of rounds?? If yes, then you may have disturbed the inner scope tube. What happens is when you fully relax the elevation knob, it does not apply adequate pressure on the scope tube and it relaxes; then if you fire some shots the relaxed tube is prone to move within the scope hence hampering your accuracy. On the other hand If you fully tighten the elevation knob it may put excessive pressure on the tube, hence damaging it.\n\nDoes you airgun have a barrel droop issue?? try shimming if you suspect it to be a drooper (many break barrel springers are droopers). Google to find out more about barrel droop n shimming.\n\nHope it helps, if not change the scope immediately and wait for those centerpoint ones to be back in stock', 1, 0, '110.37.20.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Although the Caracal one might be more robust/efficient it is at times erratic.\n6). The belly of the slide / firing pin area should be covered / enclosed and ideally the firing pin should be easily removable like the CZ Shadow.\n7). The trigger assembly needs to be made more resilient to sand and specially mud. It needs to be protected.\n8). Quality of stamping on the Slide could be improved.\n9).

They''re not wrong, but that method has its drawbacks. In a stress situation, fine motor skills evaporate.

I had my firearm on me; no one knew but one of the guys. So when the topic started, we all were talking which lead to my stupidity of saying that I had one on me at the moment, I was asked to show it. I resisted and made excuses but didn''t do it properly. Finally, I took it out, took out the mag, checked to see if it was empty, locked back the slide, and gave it to the guy who had started the topic. He checked it, gave to the guy next to him and he gave it to the next guy. Now you see, three guys handled the weapon, anyone could''ve silently slipped-in a round in the chamber, you never know! Now the third guy who had the weapon put it to one''s balls and fired. I went breathless! I immediately took it from him. I was so stupid that I again handed it to the first guy. Took it from him again, checked if it was empty, put the safety on, put the mag in, and holstered it.\n\nNow this is something that one should never do, take out one''s weapon to show it to his friends, and that too at a public place. You see, now all those people know I have weapon and where I keep it, and you never know who might get any "bright ideas", including the so-called "friends". Now I''m scared; because I go to that place alot and people can easily spot you if you''re a regular.\n\nMy first point in this thread is, never take out your weapons while with friends unnecessarily.\n\nMy second point was to ask for advice about if I shpuld go to that place again and act like everything is normal, or should I "disappear" for some time for people to forget this episode where they found out that "this" guy carries a firearm? And also, should I avoid seeing this group of friends for some time so that they also forget about this for the same reason?\n\nI would like feedback from all, especially seasoned and trained army and police personnel because they are "trained" in every aspect.\n\nThank you all.\n\n\nAs-Salaam Alaikom!', 1, 1, '182.178.7.16', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When I am in Pak[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana] I never leave home without my handgun no matter wherever I go. Not that I am scared, but it has rather turned more into a habit now. And I did notice one thing that exposing or flashing your weapon in front of your friends, or even cousins or so called relatives, intentionally or unintentionally, in most cases it achieves nothing but an unwanted &#8220;high profile&#8221; . The so called friends andeven some relatives could be quite hypocritical. They''ll often make you feel asif you doing something very wrong by carrying a gun but they''ll often do it themselves. [/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]\nIn future It is best to keep your weapon or gun concealed for many different reasons. Forexample to keep a low profile and plus also the last thing you want or need is let your enemy or a BG, Dacoit or whoever know that you are armed, because Godforbid If someone is planning something against you and they mean business, they will do it anyway but the only difference will be is that they''ll come well prepared for younknowing the fact that you are armed. I am not referring to you directly but just giving you a general example. In any kind of defense scenario whether its SD or HD Youshould always surprise and shock your enemy with an unexpected surprise that they are not expecting and are not prepared for, that&#8217;s when you get one overthem.\n\nAlso passing your gun around, people usually tend to have a habbit of fiddling around with the gun once they have it in their hands, like un-necessary blow backs, chambering/ de-chambering it playing with the hammer and trigger etc which could be a major safety threat and could often lead to major incidents. I know its hard telling them not to do so because you dont want to upset them, thinking they might get offended. so best not to hand it over or take it out in the first place. \n\nAs far as today&#8217;s story is concerned, to me it sounds minor, so do not worry about it. Inshallah you&#8217;ll be alright. Don&#8217;t let this affect your confidence. Try to avoid going to that place unnecessary for the next few days or so if you can and if the gun topic ever comes into a conversation again just say you sold your weapon or gave it away to someone, and in future try to keep your weapon concealed and do participate in the gun gossip but try to control your excitement if possible and do not to admit or confess to carrying or having a gun on you.

Strange laws by Wildlife Dept itself...... bird is actually being beaten through this netting ..... and mayhem is about gunning ...hahaha!\n\nAny views or info on that by hunters (the legality of elec tape MINUS netting)??[/QUOTE]\n\nToday I was with a wildlife watcher and asked the same question, he told me that electronic tape is not allowed even if you purchase the 10k permit, also fixed nets that we usually see on the hunting sight are also not allowed, only live bulara  is allowed and netting is allowed but not the fixed netting\n\n@Afzaal bro\n\nIt must be Sindh, because havnt heard any body getting in double figure this year in Punjab', 1, 1, '39.45.100.146', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

That elec tape (call) is not allowed technically nor are fixed nets, and both things are commonly seen everywhere in Punjab, under the very nose of department ;) as both forms are the only methods to either catch/lure these birds on ground. This new fact - fixed nets (not being allowed) is strange again. The reason obvious - to have max leverage in negotiating with netters/shooters by department. \r\n\r\nThe best solution for game (QUAIL) preservation is : to allow shooting a generous qty of birds per gun with elec tape (call) w.e.f Aug mid onwards on any day of week & ban use of nets alltogether, either fixed or mobile types. Why the dept does not technically ban that netting on paper is again as strange to me as anything. WHO sets these absurd policies from year to year ... is indeed a mystery. In Spain or some European countries, this is called developing quail hunting sites thru electronic game calls. Use of nets severely penalized there and only shotgunning (sport shooting) is allowed for Common Quail (same quail which comes here).\r\n\r\nBut lets see, how the Punjab quail bags go this time in face of torrential showers everywhere here.

Just wondering how come alot of these people who can afford one have private guards with them in their cars etc then? Is that even legal then? Cos I know some friends who are industrialists and their sons often have 2 privately hired security guards in the car when they go on long journeys.

For example start posting positive regarding any gun and within next few days prices of that gun will start increasing with dealers. That is what i m thinking at the moment i may be right and may be wrong. Other members Please comment.[/QUOTE]\n\nDamn Atif Bhai!! U have something there..

Pls point the gun in a safe direction throughout all this.\n\nLastly, pls remember to keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot and to use good quality ear muffs and eye protection.\n\nGood luck.\n\nPS Though, some people swear by it, may I suggest that you consider cleaners other than WD 40.', 1, 0, '119.155.15.57', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

For a few days only, the pakar was good, but suddenly rains started again, and pakar dropped drastically. Sind is at peak nowadays since 1st Sep. But Sind cant be compared to Punjab due to various reasons, game wise.\n\nStrange phenomenon !!! That elec tape (call) is not allowed technically nor are fixed nets, and both things are commonly seen everywhere in Punjab, under the very nose of department ;) as both forms are the only methods to either catch/lure these birds on ground. This new fact - fixed nets (not being allowed) is strange again. The reason obvious - to have max leverage in negotiating with netters/shooters by department. \n\nThe best solution for game (QUAIL) preservation is : to allow shooting a generous qty of birds per gun with elec tape (call) w.e.f Aug mid onwards on any day of week & ban use of nets alltogether, either fixed or mobile types. Why the dept does not technically ban that netting on paper is again as strange to me as anything. WHO sets these absurd policies from year to year ... is indeed a mystery. In Spain or some European countries, this is called developing quail hunting sites thru electronic game calls. Use of nets severely penalized there and only shotgunning (sport shooting) is allowed for Common Quail (same quail which comes here).\n\nBut lets see, how the Punjab quail bags go this time in face of torrential showers everywhere here. Sind shooters are indeed having a good time at least since a day or two back.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks Brother For Your detail analysis. I agree all this.

I had some good experience with A303 Sporting (it had same mid bead and a different front white ivory bead).\nBaikal O/U''s are v good guns (both field and sp) but weight is tooo much 7.9 lbs (sp model). Thats the only drawback for upland. I like Sporting model particularly. But when you are carrying approximately 8 lbs shotgun all day in field walking up and down mountains in salt ranges or in Attock or Khushab, for partridge, isn''t that weight a bit too much to lug around with? I would certainly prefer around 6.5-6.75 lbs weight, max being 7 lbs.\n\n[B]Nice input you gave about a friend''s Marocchi...what observation do you have about its KICK (recoil) in field? At partridge, one fires roughly 2 boxes of cartridges in a day on average. So that should not be a problem with recoil. If one was to use that on occassional skeet (as hobby), that wd certainly hurt the shoulder. What r your views on partridge shooting regarding its kick/recoil?[/B][/QUOTE]\n\nbrother, weight does matter in the tough terrains, and Baikal is not helping in terms of weight but in such conditions drop downing/falling chances are increased. And baikal really does not mind if it happen. \nMarochi o/u is very very good in terms of weight. easy to quick mount and carrying all the day for upland.

I just do not like hard and mushy triggers. your trigger job made hell of a difference when compared to stock caracal''s trigger.\r\n\r\n2. fixed rear sight: no drift adjustment possible without drifting the front sight. with your modification of cutting a standard glock dovetail, a world of possibilities have opened up. now we can install any glock rear sight on a caracal plus the rear sight setup is now drift adjustable. what I liked the most about your modification is that it looks like a standard factory job with high finish.\r\n\r\n3. bad grip: personal preference, the rear of the grip digs into the knuckle of my hand. plus the rear of the grip (beavertail) is not deep enough to offer any significant benefit.\r\n\r\nWHAT I LIKED THE MOST:\r\n\r\nBro, I just have to have those sights installed on my handgun, my laptop, my cellphone, my wrist watch. better yet, can you install one on me? i willing to go under surgery.\r\n\r\nthese are probably the best fixed/combat sights I have ever seen. the sight picture is just too clear and easy on the eyes.\r\n\r\nhere are the pictures that I took while the cat was away:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic6.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic7.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic9.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic10.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Moeen%20Bhai%20Caracal/Pic11.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '39.47.61.203', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0);

Competitive skeet is still probably being carried out with #9 (24g) as thats Olympic Skeet standard. #9 (31-31gms) is the best quail cartrg IMO (for the smaller quail, Common Quail) & for practicing skeet to improve upland shooting too. Earlier, when I used to do competitive skeet, I tried using #9 (skeet version, 24g) for quail..that messed up the semi-autos with soot and also due to lesser pellets and lesser velocity in #9, the #8 used to outperform it. Thats why your vote in favor for it. Otherwise I have always believed #9 (field load, 31-32 gms) is the best cartrg for our quail and occassional practice at skeet range.\r\n\r\nMigratory quail (our specie) when it arrives in Aug-Sep, it has negligible fat content and when it goes back in say April, it is the size of a see-see (per say). At that time, #8 would be better, but during arrival, its such a small bird and feeble, that birdshooter is right...you can kill it with a pebble...figuratively speaking.

As far as design issue is concerned, any imported picture from net can be copied and modified for the particular boat design, but one critical aspect is ...the height of tyres in trailer has to be equal to those in 4x4 vehicle, and the trailer horizontal to the ground when travelling.

As with All striker fired pistols, I managed to lower the trigger pull weight; however, the mushyness never went away - that will require a trigger pre/post adjustment screws on the trigger.  And as I found out yesterday, this gun is not right for the big handed people like yourself (12Gauge bhai is over 6feet tall AND MashAllah his hands are big like him) - I saw your thumb knuckle was being poked by the so called non existing beavertail.  We also yesterday found out that the ambidexterous mag release is BETTER design on the CZ999 as it doesn''t require a sharp tip to stick out of the magazine body hence it cannot snag on clothing.

Competitive skeet is still probably being carried out with #9 (24g) as thats Olympic Skeet standard. #9 (31-31gms) is the best quail cartrg IMO (for the smaller quail, Common Quail) & for practicing skeet to improve upland shooting too. Earlier, when I used to do competitive skeet, I tried using #9 (skeet version, 24g) for quail..that messed up the semi-autos with soot and also due to lesser pellets and lesser velocity in #9, the #8 used to outperform it. Thats why your vote in favor for it. Otherwise I have always believed #9 (field load, 31-32 gms) is the best cartrg for our quail and occassional practice at skeet range.\n\nMigratory quail (our specie) when it arrives in Aug-Sep, it has negligible fat content and when it goes back in say April, it is the size of a see-see (per say). At that time, #8 would be better, but during arrival, its such a small bird and feeble, that birdshooter is right...you can kill it with a pebble...figuratively speaking. And yes, starlings, common snipes can also be ideally taken with it (new #9) which will give give better spread, pellets, coverage for these skeet sized birds.[/QUOTE]\n\nBrother.\nyour analysis stand very logical. Early quails are smaller and weaker and surely #9 (31grm) is wise choice. Since quails are not coming in sufficient nos in our region, I dont have much experience abt that. \n\nI personally rate #8 best for early turtle doves and then later on as the season progresses they become weary and spooky. Than #6 is the best choice, Besides shorter and denser patterns and groups tend to drop the birds dead instead of lingering on and crippled ones.\n\nRecently first time I used #7Super on doves, they are really awesome. the increased velocity and more pallets really help alot. Took down few birds from unbelievable heights.  Actually since March Super and XL are on special discounted rate at Wah Industries i.e. 925/Box.

Therefore got to avail the opportunity.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n7 super is a gr8 duck cartrg too. And labairs are very tough and give longer ranges like ducks so they need almost same cartrg as ducks (#6 regular or 7 super). Small quail cannot be compared to labair and even 8# bursts it many times in air totally destroying the bird if shot from relatively lesser range.

These are just some I have reported. This guy is someone trying to spoil forum environment repeatedly and seems he is on some deliberate agenda to create such an atmosphere... and I have been ignoring this guy repeatedly too for last many posts. Record can be searched further in database.\r\n\r\nSince last warning few days back, he resorted to indirect rude posting rather than directly addressing to me. Thats a tactic which some people use here which indeed looks obnoxious as well as cheeky.\r\n\r\nToday I had pressed report button since 2 hours. Then posted a reply here in the last post after waiting for that long, in a moderate way. I avoided harsh words and comments like he did. Actually these posts from GUNFUN have been here on thread since 11am today without any provocation to him by me or other member... I had been in a normal conversation with someone else (maybe Liano). But, the posts by him were not deleted since morning. I think if my earlier (few days back report msg) message is recalled, I stated that this guy GUNFUN should be warned strictly or better banned as his posting style is rude and unnecessary conflict oriented. It looks he does it deliberately, without any regard to forum environment. A simple netting and legislation debate was going on ...that too with some other hunters here ...and he turned it into a brawl-like situation by unnecessarily using foul language & direct accusations. The "legislation" comment here at thios post I have reported, is also addressed indirectly to me because I had been conversing with Liano or others about netting on massive scales and solution about heavy penalties and possible imprisonment on pattern of Western countries. That legislative talk was not addressed to him....nor does he iunderstand I know it clearly as he is not into hunting nor understands any ground facts...BUT just keeps on budging mischievously for fun''s sake with disregard to forum decorum or resulting uncomfortable environment. I fail to understand his deliberate behaviour. \r\n\r\nHere, I wanted to highlight such small details which normally go un-noticed, so that such guys are watched at the "right time", than waiting for a conflict oriented situation to emerge and create a bad taste among members which neither I like nor others whom I know like here.\r\n\r\nKindly see all his posts here. After that last warning to him few days back by a MOD, he has been addressing rude words indirectly here which I have ignored time and again. The record is here too. I believe he shd have been shown the door here today on his last few posts. \r\n\r\nI request that he should be banned permanently after today''s provocative and offensive posts he unnecessarily addressed. I remember that a member "HaroonNazir" was permanently banned for saying just a small sentence to a Karachi hunter Ahmed Sultan that: "Why hunt in so large a quantity...that is butchery in my opinion" (something like that he said) after seeing Ahmed''s 500-700 quails shot in Sind last September. These posts by GUNFUN today & earlier are much more abusive and rude than that.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nFrancolino.[/quote]\r\nPost: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?7377&p=297035#post297035]Waterfowls and Upland hunting 2011-2012[/url]\r\nForum: Hunting\r\nAssigned Moderators: N/A\r\n\r\nPosted by: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?5418-GunFun]GunFun[/url]\r\nOriginal Content: [quote]i really don''t understand why members waste their time discussing their own ideas of hunting legislation-have you nothing better to do in your spare time?! nobody here, even as a self-proclaimed hunter, can change these laws. i certainly don''t read these views with any interest whatsoever, as you should legally continue with your sport/hobby, instead of trying to portray yourself as the ultimate hunter who knows all!\nanyway, happy hunting brothers and respected members.[/quote]', 1, 0, '110.36.199.128', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

As far as design issue is concerned, any imported picture from net can be copied and modified for the particular boat design, but one critical aspect is ...the height of tyres in trailer has to be equal to those in 4x4 vehicle, and the trailer horizontal to the ground when travelling.

I am gonna buy a camcorder this weekend and put it up on a tripod, turn it on and leave it the entire session, maybe then I will again slowly get used to it - I can cut the video series accordingly then.

Record can be searched further in database.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]Since last warning few days back, he resorted to indirect rude posting rather than directly addressing to me. Thats a tactic which some people use here which indeed looks obnoxious as well as cheeky.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]Today I had pressed report button since 2 hours. Then posted a reply here in the last post after waiting for that long, in a moderate way. I avoided harsh words and comments like he did. Actually these posts from GUNFUN have been here on thread since 11am today without any provocation to him by me or other member... I had been in a normal conversation with someone else (maybe Liano). But, the posts by him were not deleted since morning. I think if my earlier (few days back report msg) message is recalled, I stated that this guy GUNFUN should be warned strictly or better banned as his posting style is rude and unnecessary conflict oriented. It looks he does it deliberately, without any regard to forum environment. A simple netting and legislation debate was going on ...that too with some other hunters here ...and he turned it into a brawl-like situation by unnecessarily using foul language & direct accusations. The "legislation" comment here at thios post I have reported, is also addressed indirectly to me because I had been conversing with Liano or others about netting on massive scales and solution about heavy penalties and possible imprisonment on pattern of Western countries. That legislative talk was not addressed to him....nor does he iunderstand I know it clearly as he is not into hunting nor understands any ground facts...BUT just keeps on budging mischievously for fun''s sake with disregard to forum decorum or resulting uncomfortable environment. I fail to understand his deliberate behaviour. [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]Here, I wanted to highlight such small details which normally go un-noticed, so that such guys are watched at the "right time", than waiting for a conflict oriented situation to emerge and create a bad taste among members which neither I like nor others whom I know like here.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]Kindly see all his posts here. After that last warning to him few days back by a MOD, he has been addressing rude words indirectly here which I have ignored time and again. The record is here too. I believe he shd have been shown the door here today on his last few posts. [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Geneva]I request that he should be banned permanently after today''s provocative and offensive posts he unnecessarily addressed. I remember that a member "HaroonNazir" was permanently banned for saying just a small sentence to a Karachi hunter Ahmed Sultan that: "Why hunt in so large a quantity...that is butchery in my opinion" (something like that he said) after seeing Ahmed''s 500-700 quails shot in Sind last September.

So I passed the shop and looked back, the name of the shop was Point Blank; I was right. So I ordered something to eat and went back to the gun shop.\r\n\r\nThe dealers were all very nice and well-behaved people and started conversations by very polite Salaams. They main guy''s dealing was very honest too. He had Stoeger for 65 and CZ Duty for 105, unbargained. He said he had it for 65k because he has got fresh inventory and obviously then he had bought it at higher prices. When I checked the Stoeger, it really was a new piece, its printing was shiny new, ink was dark and not faded like all the rest. The piece was over all very very good, I must say. His CZ 999 was also new and its finishing was intact while its finishing does not last more than 6 months I think.

Safety, as mentioned, [I]ambidextrous[/I].\n[/B][/COLOR]\nCapacity is 10+1. Enough for me.\n\nI found the recoil spring to be a bit long when decompressed, and it has to be compressed in quite a lot when  reinserting it. I wasn''t happy about a plastic guide rod, however, but that''s probably in by CZ for now, can''t say.\n\n\n[SIZE=5][B][COLOR=#ff0000]Background/Ballistics:[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]\n\n\nI''ve always disdained copypasting the net since everything is just a few clicks away, and there''s quite some literature out there, explaining the .40 cal and it''s ballistic impact.\n\n\nThe rough and brief facts as I''ve derived on the caliber itself are - [I]and may be corrected by respectable seniors[/I] - as follows:\n\n\n[B]The .40 S/W caliber was developed in the aftermath of the Miami incident and as a special requirement by the US law enforcement agencies, with the view to have something that could resemble the performance of FBI''s reduced length, blasty 10mm auto ammo.The shortening of the 10mm''s cartridge in length reduced the powder load and cruise of the fare from 1300-1400 fps to roughly 1000 fps with a 180 grained fireball of the .40 S%W. [/B]\n\n[B]S&W and Winchester jointly developed the round and it''s a derivative of the 10mm auto, also referred to as 10mm Kurz (short).\n \nThe round''s cross sectional dia in plain milimeters measures 10.16mm and the round is therefore a medium between the .45 ACP and the 9mm, travelling almost the velocity of the 9, carrying though a 40-50% heavier projectile as standard loads, the most popular being the 180 grained, but with options like 160 and 200 grains as well. \n\nThe idea is simple: No or insignificant compromise on the velocity as compared to the 9mm, yet with an increased delivery load for higher terminal impact. How higher? Well, don''t ask me, only a surviving sucker would know better to tell the tale.\n [COLOR=#ff0000]\n[I]To me it was not the choice for any "super gun" as such, but merely an add up item to serve the versatility in collection calibers.[/I][/COLOR][/B]\n\n[B]The 180 grained .40 S&W round leaves the muzzle at roughly 1000 fps. The lighter ones, i.e 160 grained, may be almost at par with the common 9mm round''s velocity, 1200 to 1300 fps.[/B]\n\n[B]Conversely, the .40 S&W round is swifter than the .45 Auto''s 230 grains subsonic 850 fps MV, and course must have a reduced level of "felt recoil" as well.[/B]\n\n Hence, it''s a medium between the other two popular calibers and vastly in use today by the US LEA''s as assigned service calibre, and with a popularity on the rapid gain within civilian use as well.\n\nIt''s deemed a nicely adequate and effective defensive round to get the job done, but I shall not dwell upon this further, as it is respected Skeeter Sir''s and other senior respectable member''s domain and expertise.\n \nPersonally, I''ve just always been of the opinion, that provided you can control the wild forces of recoil and not compromise on the shot placements, [I]bigger is always better[/I]!\n\n Enough on the caliber for now, and I believe a CZ-75B too does not request for any big words, it''s a "[I]CZ-The-legend"[/I], and it''s supposed to behave like one. \n\n I am reserving the next 2 posts for filling in the pending range affair, as not to have this review scattered around.\n \nUpcoming news here, from the popping of the cherry affair, will be focused on following important factors about the .40 S&W 75B, since it''s a 1.st timer here - [I]probably[/I] - and with no back-up [I]logistics[/I]:\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]1) Accuracy.[/B][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]2) Target reacquistion in quick successives.

Yet these bullets should only be restricted to 200 yds only for Urial and Sindh Ibex.\n\nThe 22-250 is one of the great Varmint cartridges and is very good for long range shots on small game like jackals , chinkara etc. I t can reach 4300 ft per sec with 40 gr bullets and upto 3950 ft /sec with 52 gr bullets, with the 55 gr and 60 gr bullets it can reach 3775 and 3625 ft/sec and these can be used on game the size of Urial and Sindh Ibex upto 300 yds.

"\r\n\r\nRef: REPORTING ABOVE PART IN THIS POST\r\n\r\nAbove part is again objectionable and a 100% lie, concocted and typical twisting of facts that this member is posting here despite a warning by Admin. He is trying to portray ''criticism of netting'' as ''attacks on poor people''! How absurd....twisting facts to his advantage. And ''knowledge and education'' part....we know that policy changes and appointing right people at jobs in wildlife dept is the key to change. He is throwing hollow arguments everywhere without any knowledge that too in an arrogant tone, hitting indirectly again.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows it is the landlords (big and small) who set up netting addas at various places in their lands via their men. Only a land owner (mostly big ones) do this sort of stuff as a 12V battery, tape caller, amp, 4 speakers, poles, expensive large nets etc are involved as part of purchase and above all, permission to instal nets in peoples'' lands or local landlords mostly do it themselves. We all know also that this slogan above used by this guy GUNFUN is either deliberate or he does not know anything about ground facts at all. In both cases, he needs to control his urge to interfere unecessarily in such arguments, or he needs to show humility in asking & correct his attitude. From the very first post he has made in this section, its clear he has a certain immaturity and attitude problem which is causing such confrontations and irresposible communicatioin with members including me twice.\r\n\r\nI would therefore recommend a ban on this person, or minimum a last warning with deletion of this part from his post. Otherwise, the forum should should give us prerogative to reply to such crazy people with attitude problems.\r\n\r\nThank you.[/quote]\r\nPost: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?7377&p=297831#post297831]Waterfowls and Upland hunting 2011-2012[/url]\r\nForum: Hunting\r\nAssigned Moderators: N/A\r\n\r\nPosted by: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?5418-GunFun]GunFun[/url]\r\nOriginal Content: [quote][QUOTE=Masroor;297726]Nice Say dear.

As the place was new for me and both of them were unknown to me I was doubtful If they are telling the truth or lie, I thought what would I do If they run away with my cell phone as there was a wide open area behind the restaurant with fields and crops, I admit that I don&#8217;t have a much running stamina. when they saw the doubts on my face they offered that they can pay for a phone call. I told them I don&#8217;t need any payment and handed over my cell phone to one of the guy thinking that Allah Malik Hai lets see what happens, He made a call for couple of minutes and walk to a distance from me while the other was standing with me, I made myself alert and ready for any kind of worst circumstances. He finally ended the call and returned my cell phone to me with a bundle of thanks, both of them were thanking me so humbly that I got ashamed of  my previous doubts about them. Although I took a sigh of relief when my cell phone reached in my hand. And then I felt satisfied that I have helped someone in need, otherwise I would have a guilt in my heart if I would have not let them make a phone call.\n   \n  I left the restaurant and continued my travelling and after about 5 to 6 hours I received a call and the calling person was asking me to talk with the same guys I met at the restaurant. I told the calling person that the guys were not with me I met them at a restaurant and they were on their own way. The person who was calling told me that they are waiting for those guys as the dead body has to be buried before its dark. It proved that the guys I met at the restaurant were telling the truth and their need to make a call was genuine not fake.\n   \n  The moral of the story is that Its not all the time we use to meet the cheaters but sometime we use to meet the people who are really needy and their problems are also genuine not fake, But all of us hesitate to help them because of some of the cheaters and bad guys.

The only option available in other market was  Chinese Imported TT, not Zastava and Other Choices.\n\nWhen I purchased this TT, I had 4 choices:\n\n1- Local TT @ 12k\n2- Chinese TT @ 25k\n3- Zastava Serbia Made @ 45k\n4- Zigana P9 TT Turkey made @ 50k (I got this @ 47k with little bargaining)\n\nThe best looking TT was the Turkey Made, the others has the same look and feel like the local TT, that''s why I purchased the best option available.\n\nThanks to [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?1081-Mani"][B]Mani[/B][/URL], [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?2493-Nazim-Sahib"][B]Nazim Sahib[/B][/URL], [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?592-Topak"][B]Topak[/B][/URL], [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?4659-polyglot80"][B]polyglot80[/B][/URL], [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?7661-chohan"][B]chohan[/B][/URL], [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?7646-alinazier"][B]alinazier[/B][/URL]\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nCh.

It could have gone into the Legal section or the dealer section. I;s rather the mods decide where to park it. For now I am submitting it here.\r\n\r\nZain Bhai if I have omitted anything please help me out a bit by adding anything that is missing:\r\n\r\nRecently Zain bhai came to Karachi on a 2 day visit. We decided to make the most of it. \r\n\r\nOn the morning of the first day we went to the Home department where we met the In charge of the Computerised arms license section. We had an informal chat with him over a cup of tea and he helped clear a lot of misconceptions. \r\n\r\nHe told us that new computerized SHD lics are being made, however they are issued only through the instructions of the CM and the Home Sec.  I.e. only special contacts of these 2 gentlemen. The department is not processing applications on its own of people who simply apply. Whether on their own or though dealers. \r\n\r\nHe further stated that virtually all popular B.A rifles are NPB here. And as regards semi autos, only .22s are allowed. \r\n\r\nThere have been reports that 5.54 NATO has been declared NPB in semi-auto. Indeed I have learnt that a number of dealers are offering an’ upgrade’ of the usual NPB lic to include these as well. \r\n\r\nHe categorically stated that the department does not consider the 5.54 to be NPB at all even in semi-auto. The Home secretary has the power to issue a special permit that will be attached to the lic and would enable a person to purchase the weapon. However such permits are essentially permits and not licenses and they can easily be canceled as and when the incumbent HS will be transferred. \r\n\r\nI also asked him about shooting ranges on private property. He said that he had no idea since no private property owner in the city limits had come to enquire about the laws governing such ranges. \r\n\r\nLater we visited other dignitaries and then headed for Point blank which we failed to find and then we went to DAAD where he had tea with Hannan. He showed us a lot of nice stuff. \r\n\r\nTaurus 809 80k\r\n\r\nGlock 4 Gen 385k\r\n\r\nCZ 100 (used) 60k-50k (tag and final price)\r\n\r\nCaracal F 78k-72k (Tag & Final Price)\r\n\r\nColt .45 Gold plated and engraved (American army model made in 1913) 170k\r\n\r\nColt. 45 Silver placed and engraved (Amarican army model made in 1919) 160k\r\n\r\nTaurus 809c 82k\r\n\r\nTaurus 917c 78k\r\n\r\n\r\n.32 revolver 7 shot Arminius used 20k\r\n\r\n.32 revolver 6 shot Taurus used 30k\r\n\r\n.32 revolver 6 shot Rossi used 40k\r\n\r\nWalter .22 used 50k \r\n\r\nAssortment of switchblades from 7.5 to 2.5k\r\n\r\nTo my everlasting dismay he had sold a used CF for 28k only last week. (Apparently he was the 4 or 5th dealer who sold the weapon only a few days before I wanted to buy it)\r\nBut he has promised he might find me a similar piece next week. Hope springs eternal etc etc. \r\n\r\nZain Bhai bought some sort of telescopic sight from him for 10k which I hope fits his Brno and does not suffer the tragic fate of its predecessor mounts. \r\n\r\nThe next day we went to the local Police Station to do something about my purloined all Pak MOI Green Back. I managed to get it back from the lawyer who had taken it after promising to have it cancelled. Once again Courtesy Zain bhai who was kind enough to send my details to the MOI who informed us that the license was intact. Apparently it had been lying in the Lawyer’s drawer since last year!\r\n\r\nNevertheless we did file a report in the station and took a copy ourselves since the license had not been in my possession for over a year. Thanks to a few phone calls again courtesy Zain bhai, the police were extremely polite and courteous and offered us tea and cold drinks and made the report in 5 minutes flat. \r\n\r\nLater on we met a few more people and went for Tea and then he left for Larkana again. I am happy to have re-gained possession of my long lost MOI and to have gained such a nice friend…', 1, 1, '119.155.28.75', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

These are some personal observations of friends including me. Every employee there is some ''sifarishi'' of some influential and thus transfers and postings of inefficient men deployed there is also an issue. As far as feeding area thing is concerned, the habitat where ducks feed at night there is vast and even with ''dib & feeding pockets'' vanished from suroundings, the pond reserve area''s large expanse of feeding waters are there year round. The only thing is to let those ducks stay disturbance free (from shotgun firing and nets) after migration waves hit waters there - so that daytime movements of these ducks are seen at regular water channels of rivers and back channels & non reserve areas where game is allowed, upstream and downstream of barrage. Note: For this same reason, it is a crime in West to fire at waterfowl when they are feeding during those post sunset or pre dawn hours.

These 2 factors have destroyed that game area. \n\nFirst factor''s reasons I would like to ask myself from knowledgeable shikaris of that belt like Masroor sb, and the second factor is self-explanatory i.e. deals with ''dept'' after which it is allowed to carry on. Obviously the fish contractors'' men (fishermen ''sindhis'' as they are called there, like at Chashma barrage reserve game area), do that after striking a deal with the ''sacred cows'' deputed by Deptt there. These are some personal observations of friends including me. Every employee there is some ''sifarishi'' of some influential and thus transfers and postings of inefficient men deployed there is also an issue. As far as feeding area thing is concerned, the habitat where ducks feed at night there is vast and even with ''dib & feeding pockets'' vanished from suroundings, the pond reserve area''s large expanse of feeding waters are there year round. The only thing is to let those ducks stay disturbance free (from shotgun firing and nets) after migration waves hit waters there - so that daytime movements of these ducks are seen at regular water channels of rivers and back channels & non reserve areas where game is allowed, upstream and downstream of barrage. Note: For this same reason, it is a crime in West to fire at waterfowl when they are feeding during those post sunset or pre dawn hours.

Your Observations Are Very right. I have already many time Highlights  these things here.

He immediately checked the chamber after seeking my permission to handle and surprisingly kept his fingers away from the trigger all the time. Being curios I promptly asked “As per my knowledge you never even had an Air Gun in your life how come you know about the safety principles of Firearms. He replied “Pakguns”.

I hunker down (learnt that in 19 yrs married life)…but she can’t peep into my heart, can she?.            My 4yr son wants to lay hands on this new toy ….I had to bribe him with a light emitting noisy contraption….. I hate it’s sound already (the battery is proving to last longer than my nerves - unpredictable Chinese stuff). My friends… I see the envy in their eyes and gleefully let em caress it. But on the range I am the Boss and I own it.\n\nA year or so back I was comparing some 9MMs for buying off the market, including NP-22, CF-98 and Cougar Stoeger 8000. While on the range I got opportunity to fire a few mags off someone’s duty G-19 (dunno which model). I was really impressed on my first attempt and that too rapid fire at 25M. Comparatively my two bit intro feeling about these weapons was; NP-22: Good but bit wayward (later shot a lot and got used to it quite well), Stoeger: excellent/good balance and weighty (I liked the feel), CF-98: I’ve had better (LOL)….. Requires getting used to, stiff when new, awkward safety...... but excellent Bang 4 the Buck. \n\nEventually I got a duty NP-22 and kept yearning for the G-19. A year and a half’s research followed with countless hours on Pakguns, going through numerous foreign gun reviews and comparisons and finally....... I homed on this gun. Mighty real effort and running around of six months …. getting the correct paper work and the permits, visit to the land of Glocks on the other side of the world and a lot of coordination later…… Yippee……I am the proud owner of a GLOCK 19 Gen 4.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nsalam, Congrats on ur purchase. brother can u please write in detail how you imported the gun yourself ?', 1, 1, '39.47.251.190', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I have been overdue with this survey for almost a month now. \n\nI had been trying to find some Taurus copies that look so like the real thing they are scary. Down to the same boxes and even plastic packing, warranty cards, manuals etc. \n\nI found them last month at [b]Shahid arms and Watch Company[/b] a very small and nondescript shop on M.A Jinnah road. The owner had oodles of clones. He showed me Taurus&#8217;s both black and white for around 38k NO bargains whatsoever. He said they are a darned sight better then the Cheap CF 98s the Chinese have flooded the market with.   When I insisted that the CF is still better value for money. He showed me a first copy. Round 28k non-negotiable.  The copy was very very good. No doubt about it down to the green manual in sealed plastic packing. They had thought of everything. The only give away was the ridiculously stiff control lever. Now Cf levers tend to be stiff&#8230;.. but this was ridiculous!!!!!Who ever made it, went overboard in the &#8216;stiffness&#8217; department. Over all the place is expensive. They don&#8217;t do licenses or permits or PS entry. \n\nA week later I went to the market with Zaheer bhai.  He wanted to sell his Turk Shotguns.  We went to [b]Huffaz Corporation[/b] where we were offered pretty low prices. I asked the prices of different products and found out that most of em were at least 10 to 15% higher than some other dealers.\n\nSo we decided to try one of my old hangouts. [b]Ali Muhammad and Sons[/b].  Adnan offered to buy the Turks at the price we asked for. I have never seen a dealer do that before&#8230; I like the guy he respects his customers. \n\nHowever later on when I went there with Muddasir Bhai they offered to extend his 144 permit. Nasir said that it will be ready in 1 day. But it took them 6 days to do it. Nasir did offer to waive the charges though.  \nThe biggest problem with dealing with A M & S is that they don&#8217;t pick their phones specially Nasir. \nApparently he was not taking his employer&#8217;s calls all that much himself. Therefore, they got rid of him. \n\nFrom then onwards we went to [b]Royal Arms lucky star[/b] (Right next to the wine shop). I had been trying to trace the origin of those Taurus copies. It turned out that the brothers Habibullah and Asadullah have introduced them in the market and they were charging 32k each per clone. And 34k for the SS version.  They also had a Girsan 30k and a 909 31K. I have been looking at clones and collecting data for a comprehensive review for some time. But I have never ever seen such well made and packaged clones in my life!\n\nHowever paying in the 30s for what are essentially knock offs is just plain wrong&#8230; When U can get a slightly used CF for the same price.\nThey also had AK 47 type shotguns. Available in the market for around 20k or so. They offered the same at  34k. They had some sort of Grip on it. The gun had the legend &#8220;Gift for u&#8221; printed on the receiver. \nI guess it was the proximity to the wine shop&#8230;..\n\nThen it was on to Mr. Abdul Ghani at [b]New Pak Shaheen Armoury[/b]. I asked him for a used CF 98. And he offered me one for 37k (Just bout the last possible price for an NIB piece)\n\nIt was FAKE. And not a good one either. The weapon, the control  lever, the box ugh! Zaheer bhai saw that its hammer was twisted. .. It was a used piece all right. A FAKE used piece .. for 37K!!! He then proceeded to show me a local Stoeger Cougar. Claimed its amazing..yadda yadda yadda. I decocked it. And the decocker stuck!. He tried it. It was broken&#8230; We decided we had seen enough. We left. \n\nThen on to [b]Decent Arms[/b]. I met Sher Zaman there. He is supposedly the manufacturer of the Taurus Copies. Since I had not bought his Taurus Copies at 32k. he decided to convince me to buy his Beretta copy at 32k. Opened it and showed me the barrel. Claimed that its metallurgy was 2nd to none.  4045 steel barrel. Wire cut hammer. And what&#8217;s more his Zagana copies were used by the DHA Security force after being cleared by the Pak Army itself! He was willing to let me have the ziggy at the paltry sum of 34k. \nVery nice of him really.  But we really could not accept his &#8216;kindness&#8217; so we left. \n\nMeanwhile I and Muddasir Bhai went to [b]Ansari Arms[/b]. While he was looking for .22 rifles. I amused myself with their revolver collection. I saw an interesting looking worn out Euasta for 12k tag price.\n\nI tried it. It was broken. So I tried it again. It was still broken. But the dealer said it&#8217;s not. I decided not to argue and we left.', 1, 1, '116.71.34.207', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The NATO Stock Number\n\nCountries that participate in the NCS follow common standards and techniques to assign NSNs to items of supply in their defense inventory. The National Codification Bureau (NCB) within each country centrally assigns their national NSNs. The assignment of an NSN fixes the identity of each distinctive item of supply. All NSNs are uniform in composition, length, and structure. Each is represented by a 13- digit number, which can be divided into 3 unique parts:\n\n\nthe first four digits are the NATO Supply Classification (NSC) code, which relates the item to the group and class of similar items\n\nthe next two digits indicate the assigning NCB code (each country has its own two-digit NCB code-the United States uses "00" and "01")\n\nthe final seven digits are assigned sequentially and have no inherent significance. However, this number relates to one and only one item of supply within the codifying country.\n\nWithin NATO, the NCS currently contains 16 million active NSNs (about 7 million U.S. and about 9 million assigned by other NATO countries). The items represented range from hand grenades to guided missiles, from propeller blades to space vehicles, and from soap dishes to washing machines.[/quote]\n\n2.

(300042, 2289, 67113, 'baybaymaham', 8485, 'New in arms &amp; forum  want your guidace', 1347957693, '[QUOTE=Abbas;67113]Salams, a lot of the friends that come here to PakGuns are relatively new to the world of firearms and are thinking about or have recently got a new license and are looking for the right right gun to buy for their SD or HD (Self Defense, Home Defense) needs. Many new threads are opened everyday about the topic and it gets repetitive and the information becomes less useful over time. \n\nI would like to suggest a couple of guns for the first time users in various price ranges and a mini one line review of the suggested firearm. Details and discussion on any of them can be found by clicking the search button on our panel bar and typing the desired gun name i.e Glock or CF98.\n\nTo start off with I would like to say that the most important thing when keeping a gun for self defense is knowing how to use it properly. All guns are useless and counter productive if the shooter does not have a reasonable level of proficiency in the use of the firearm. Proficiency only happens by firing atleast 200 to 300 rounds in a controlled environment like a range and at a target. Once you are hitting a head size target at 10 to 25 feet you are good to go since in 90 % of the cases that is the maximum distance your gun will be used for defensive shooting.\n\nMost people new to firearms do not understand what calibers are and what difference it makes. In a nutshell calibers are difference sizes of bullets, .22 being small, 9mm being average and .45 being large. The difference it makes to [B][U]New Users[/U][/B] is that generally the larger the bullet, the higher the recoil and lower the accuracy of the second shot. I suggest selecting 9mm as a caliber for your defense needs. It''s like Goldilocks porridge not too hot, not too cold and just right ;) \n\nIn the world of firearms and defense the most important thing is reliability and all the weapons listed here have proven their worth by multiple tests. Ofcourse the more you spend the more reliable firearm you will get. \n\n\nIn 9mm there are several guns available in the market in varying price ranges. A suggested few are:\n\nIn the Rs. 30,000 price range there is the [B]CF-98[/B].\n\n[IMG]http://www.leverarms.com/Pistol%20Images/Norinco%20CF98.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIt is made in China and is a decent medium size light weight gun. It is quite accurate and probably the best you can buy around Rs. 30,000.\n\nIn the Rs. 45,000 price range, your options open up quite a bit and there is the [B]CZ 999, the Canik 55 and the Stoeger Cougar 8000. [/B]\n\n[B]CZ 999:[/B]The CZ is a great gun, extremely accurate and well made. You cannot go wrong with it. It is a high quality copy of the SIG 226 pistol which retails for around Rs. 350,000. It is made in Serbia. \n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/cz999-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Canik 55:[/B] This is my personal favorite. It''s a clone of the CZ75 B and is the most accurate sub Rs. 100,000 pistol I have ever fired. Very high quality copy. Made in Turkey. I got mine for just under Rs. 40,000.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik552.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Stoeger Cougar:[/B] Probably one of the most discussed pistols at PakGuns, this pistol is very highly regarded by all for it reliability and size. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik555.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Taurus PT 99[/B]. If you are a fan of Beretta and large shiny objects appeal to you ;) I suggest looking no further than the PT 99 by Taurus. It is one of the best pistols of the world in any price range. Very high quality piece and one of my favorites. I have shot over 4000 rounds though my pistol and it''s still brand new. Very accurate too. The only drawback is the size, it is a large frame pistol and not really comfortable to carry around. Very highly recommended. Price Around 54 K.\n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/taurus_pt99.jpg[/IMG]\n\nApart from these guns, nothing in my opinion can be justified because of the insane prices. The only gun that I would recommend spending more money on is either the Glock 17 or the Glock 19. The 17 sells for around Rs. 225,000 currently and the 19 for Rs. 250,000. The difference between the two is that the 17 is larger and more accurate and the 19 is smaller and slightly less accurate than the 17. The reason you pay a much higher cost is reliability and durability. Glock is absolutely the most reliable handgun in the world and it will last multiple lifetimes.\n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/glock17.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nA closing note on magazine capacity ammunition type and durability.\n\nBoys will be boys and every manufacture that makes products aimed at men will stress "more is better" but that is not necessarily always the case. Although a 20 round magazine will get "wow''s" from your friends, more rounds in your magazine will make your weapon larger and heavier. For most situations you do not practically need anything above 13 or 15. Infact that is excessive as well, what you can''t do in the first 5 shots you aren''t going to do in the next 20. So if the handgun you are choosing has a magazine capacity of 13 or 15 you are good to go. If you feel you need more rounds, then that''s what the extra magazine is for. \n\nAmmunition type. For target shooting and practice you use normal 9mm rounds which cost around Rs. 35 (POF, CHINESE). For Self defense however you use "Hollow Points". These bullets are specifically designed for defensive purposes and will expand upon impact thus having a higher probability of knocking your target down. They cost around Rs. 65 to Rs. 250 depending upon make. I would suggest atleast firing a box of 50 rounds of hollow points though your gun to make sure they work well before loading your magazines with them.\n\nDurability. Most people will go on and on about barrel life and forging technology and yada yada. Yawn.... :rolleyes: \n\nA gun will last "FOREVER" if maintained properly. You must clean your gun within 24 hours of use or it starts to get damaged. Barrel life is nonsense and is of no concern to 99 % of the people. Ammunition is so expensive that if we take the CF 98 whose barrel under the worst conditions still lasts 3000 rounds then that means you fired about Rs. 100,000 worth of ammunition though a Rs. 30,000 gun. Not very probable, if someone has that much money to spend on ammo then I''m sure they will buy a better gun first.\n\nAnd last but not least remember that if you own a firearm you are a grownup and a responsible individual. Anger, Machoism and Irresponsible behavior have no place in the life of an firearm owner. Before you own firearms these three things should be ingrained in your psyche. \n\n\n1). EMPTY OR LOADED, NEVER EVER POINT YOUR GUN AT ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DESTROY.\n\n2). ALWAYS ALWAYS KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER TILL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THE TARGET.\n\n3). NEVER CARRY/USE A GUN UNLESS YOU NEED TO.\n\n\nHope this little write up helps all our new brethren to the wonderful world of Firearms ! If anyone has any question I and all PakGunners will answer them gladly. No question is too basic or foolish, we are all learners here.[/QUOTE]\n\nI need your guidance, I am about to get my arm provincal license (KARACHI)within a week and looking at purchasing a handgun 9mm pistol.

A lot of factors will affect the choice of pellet for long distance shooting.  to name a few;  it depends on how much muzzle velocity the airgun produces! Ideally the more ME it generates the more energy the pellet carries hence greater chances of retaining energy at longer distances. If you have a medium powered airgun, a heavier pellet will drop more therefore the scope will need to be adjusted accordingly and you will NEED a scope with mil-dots to judge and accurately hit your target at variable distances; and a lighter pellet will be more prone to be affected by wind etc at distances beyond 70 yards so again you''ll need a good scope and a good hand to shoot :) \n\nTo put it simply if you have an airgun that spits out pellets in excess of 800 fps use heavier pellet (between 16-19 grain) from AirArms, JSB or H&N. For medium powered airgun (between 680-750 fps) go with medium weight pellets (13-15 grains) here you have a relatively wide choice of pellets e.g. RWS, Crosman, JSB, and H&N.

I guess Hunter1 party shot quite a handful. Gr8 shooting for them. \n\nWe also took a chance despite bad weather reports. We had an invitation for Saturday and Sunday at two different areas. First day I could not go due to commitments here. And our friends (three guns) had a gr8 quail day. Shot 97 (retrieved) in morning shoot. No rain however on Sat.\n\nThinking that it would be dry on Sunday as well, we went to a second area and district in morning but were surprised to find that just an hour or two before dawn, light to moderate rains slashed the area and small pools of water were seen around pattis. However with the help of a few pointers, we managed to scan the small bushes and shrubs....shot about 40. Then immediately moved to another patti nearby where there were some nice fields too, but lesser standing water. Again the dogs (real good ones) got us another 59-60. The total was about 100 shot in a morning with four guns.\n\nSeeing the black clouds and drizzle which had already started during the last hour or more of the second beat, we then headed for the vehicles and drove back. [Pics wd be posted soon]\n\nHad it been a drier and sunny weekend, the quail potential would have been much better, and the bag would have been double that, as only 50% of the birds flew, rest kept sitting in moisture laden conditions, preferring not to fly. Currently, now that water is in fields everywhere after the heavy Sunday/Monday downpur, lets see whether any more of the quail action remains. We hope that we would manage to get 2 more quail shoots out of the fall season, subject to rains.\n\nHappy quail hunting to all ![/QUOTE]\n\nVery Nice <excellent Hunting Dear.

Although its a simple place where you can discuss whats in the shop. Now the matter has reached to integrity of my father name Peerzada Sajid Majeed and his business. People not knowing the facts are putting baseless allegations. We are in Arms & Ammunition business Since 1961 and are in import business since 1978. I don''t need to give clarifications. But you are better known that to build a good pool of guns and variety you have exchange some of your guns and usually it is done as a wise act to get the maximum variety. Everything stopped at the rates at the thread but it never went to forward as it has gone now. I have already told my client and clearing agent to stop posting threads. But the matter is, I am only getting one answer and you better know it. I ask you to either lift my permanent ban so that I can give logical answers and quit this all up. I have no concern with what one does in the market. I am limited to my business. Alhamadulillah people have firm belief on our dealing. The second option is that delete this thread immediately as this thread may lead to some misconception & build a big lava inside that when burst will cause alot of damage[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#333333][FONT=Arial].

In the price, I also got a stupid Tasco 4x20 (junk) which the dealer was selling for 150 each.\n\nRecoil: That''s what I love the most about it, it''s almost non-existent. No problem for any scope, you can use the plain cheapo mounts that come with the scope and mount it. I used this scope on the same mount on my Diana 350F, and after just 3 shots the setup slid off.\n\nThe gun is void of any manual safety yet the trigger is annoying enough to compensate for that.\nSling swivels are attached to the stock, but you don''t really need to sling it.\n\nThe open sights are non-adjustable to a great extent. The stock has some nice pattern and colors, but there was a crack near the trigger guard ever since I bought it. It seemed heavier than the Chinese break barrels I was previously using. The trigger was hard (some 8lbs, a guess) and barrel breaking effort was tough as well, but this smoothed just in a few shots - until I got the spring changed, it''s gotten alot stiffer now, and the trigger....don''t ask.\n\nScoping the gun makes it a whole lot accurate and it makes 1-1.5 groups at 10-15yds. I had a Busnell Banner 3-9x40 on mine, shot some doves with this setup. When the gun was new, I shot some doves and crows out to 30yds and considered that a looong range with airguns back then.\n\nThe power, when new, was 550-600fps...... it would only break lighter glass bottles with rightly placed shots ad that ability faded as the shot count went into hundreds.\nThe power is extremely inconsistent, goes down from some 12fpe to 3fpe in 1000 shots or less (my experience). After every 100 shots or so there is a significant reduction is power. Also the sound of the airgun is louder than the power. \nIt would be rendered a dove hunting gun uptill 500 shots or so, as in my case.\nAfter that, doves would be injured as close as 5-10yds and the twang was just soooo low. The pellet wouldn''t  even enter a Dalda cooking oil tin at 5 feet.\n\nThe gun got rusted, got it removed, now it''s rusted again..... it''s somehow prone to rusting.\n\nSo last year I got the spring changed, the gunsmith charged 500rs for a Chinese Diana 27 spring and labor. I didn''t shoot it much though as I didn''t have any spare scope and it was shooting haywire with open sights. So finally I took it out from hibernation a few days ago.\n\nI chrono-ed it with 14.3gn Crosman Premiers, and it averaged 5.5fpe. That''s nothing, but still the spring has a loud twang. Also what I noticed is that after getting the spring changed somehow the trigger pull has really gone wild, some 10-12lbs.... I have difficulty shooting it even with 2 or 3 fingers. I used 2 fingers, still it took some 2-3 seconds and 5x the effort of a Diana. This caused shifting in POI as the gun moved quite a bit.\n\nAnyhow, I attached a Chinese 2-6x32AO scope which I had, unused, lying around since long. Attaching took just a minute or so, zeroing, around 15minutes - as initially it wasn''t shooting great groups due to the extra hard, annoying trigger.\n\nThen finally I settled on this 1.25in group at 13-15yds using H&N wadcutters, scope at 6xmag.\nIt''s a good group for a 4500rs gun and good for dove hunting. At present, I would be able to shoot them at 15-20yds max with proper placement. But I''m looking for a spring replacement now with a minimum of 12fpe.\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/zgun012_zps4e4fb8b9.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/zgunz013_zps44711eef.jpg[/IMG]\n\nOpinion: It''s not something you should be wasting your money on, [B]Except the following:[/B]\n.It''s for a child/begginer\n.You''re just looking for a cheap practice gun.\n.You want to shoot doves in your garden and can afford having the spring replaced every 500 shots.\n\nOverall, I had no fun shooting it mainly due to the trigger and low power.', 1, 1, '119.73.6.2', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I like it here.  So I was always looking to purchase a license in Punjab for manufacturing.  Then I could have promised extreme quality.  But we can''t have everything in life sooo I am moving on and the way I see it - its not only my loss but everyones.  I will no longer be working on any new projects uptill or until I can''t get a license of my own so I can do everything under my own roof.  I regret ever having to have done what I did so far.  Should have invested in the purchase of a shop in Jinnah Super and it would have made me much more money and given me more satisfaction rather than what I went through with the project.\nSorry.[/QUOTE]\n\nMoeen i m sorry dear, as i m a business student too return on capital investment is always at 1st place, please share you location may be i can do some thing for you.', 1, 1, '175.110.73.23', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

All shotgun barrels respond same way i.e. become hotter, if repeated firing is done without proper gaps. And...reasons for slower mechanism are:\r\n- Jammed or dirty recoil spring (inside stock) due to oil, moisture and dirt accumulation (recommended cleanup from gunsmiths after every 500-1000 cartrg rounds).\r\n- Lack of proper cleaning of all other routine maintenance parts (piston, bolt assembly, trigger group, magazine, mag shaft etc .. best cleaner is Gun Scrubber, BF CLP, Brunox)\r\n- Lack of proper oiling at critical parts such as rails on which bolt assembly moves etc & general wiping of all surface areas with a lightly oiled cloth. Here, a high viscosity gun oil prefereably with Teflon is recommended (best are Rem-Oil which has Teflon and Slip 2000 which is the best if available).\r\n\r\nSo.....mechanisms of all semiautos function OK if above routine is followed.

I''ve not read other member''s comments and thoughts on this incident yet but just to make afew quick comments immediately after reading the story, Unfortunately these are the kind of threats we have to put up with now adays. Apart from spending sometime in the Royal Territorial Army and further undertaking work placements with the Met Police here in Yorkshire, I now work for the UK''s largest Security Company. As part of my job I have been going undertaking and been attending various different trainings, including the "Conflict Management" training which is probably the most important one out of all the subjects because thats where we are trained on how to tackle and deal with different hostile situations and conflicts in the most appropriate manner with the best outcome.\n From my own experience the way you handled this situation was the best possible solution. Because being a winner in such scenarios doesn’t always mean the other side being brought down or dead etc, but they say that the tough ones are always the calm ones who stay calm, immediately carries out a quick Dynamic Risk Assesment and then immediately tackle the situation without lashing out or losing control. You quickly assessed the situation or threat, then immediately responded in a way that prevented a potentially deadly attack without any one being hurt or killed and did not lose your calm. \n In that scenario legally you would have been in your rights to shoot the perpetrator if you wanted to because most Laws in every country state that if someone threatens your life with an offensive weapon and you feel your life is in danger you can respond and use necessary force required to stop or prevent the strike. Shooting him could have been justified in the court of law because he was about to pull a loaded gun at you, and that would have been enough to  justify you firing at him as self-defense but you did not do so and the way you handled it was even better. It takes a real man to keep his feet on the ground and do what you did in such scenarios. Well Done.\n\nNow lets talk abit about the other man or the potential attacker. \nOne minor possibility is that the driver driving the Merc could have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs as he failed to stop in the time required for him to break and stop at a safe distance on a traffic light. Because the use such substances slow down your reaction or response time. \nBut in my opinion there is a big possibility that this attack was pre planned. Mugging or robbing someone at the gunpoint is not the only way fraudsters, thieves, muggers, Robbers and Dacoits use to loot or rob people but many other different tactics are also used and this could have been one of them. May be he had stolen the car from somewhere, or maybe he had snatched it from someone at teh gunpoint in a different area and then planned this whole scenario to go, find a victim, bump his car into them from behind, and then try all what he tried with you to make some money.\n\nEven though in this case his plan backfired at him as in this case his chosen target or the victim (YOU) turned out to be a lot more clicked on than him which he most likely never expected but in other cases there are chances that he would have succeeded in his plan because in most circumstances most of our general public out there walk around un-armed and if it was some poor or naive working class citizen who do not want any trouble he would have just said ok brother I will pay you money etc simply because they don’t want trouble, or being involved in such cases on the legal side, and no trips to Police stations or courts, or no physical fights so often most people would just pay on the spot to avoid any further trouble and then these b*strds (excuse my language) become more and more confident and continue to do so. From what I can gather he was just a thief in a stolen Merc, also in most cases a man who genuinely owns such a car will probably not react or behave in the manner he was behaving.\n\nHe may have not made it obvious on the scene but believe me it was a nasty surprise for him. I bet you he never expected such a response, to him from your first look when you came out of your car was just a random yuppy in the suit with the money who he thought he is going to show is his TT to, pointing at him and you were going to start shaking pleading for your life begging on your knees saying please sir take the money, take the car and let me go. Lol. If anything it turned round to be the other way round.\nOne of my friends recently visited me here in UK from Peshawar and told me a story about his older brother that once his elder brother who I also know was driving his car in Peshawar and had his cell phone on the front passenger seat. All of sudden some guy on a motorcycle hit his cars back bumper from behind, he stopped the car, got out of his car started walking towards the guy on the motor cycle behind him and while he was walking another guy on another motorcycle quickly stopped near his front passengers side door, quickly grabbed the mobile phone from the front passenger seat and both guys on both motorcycles fled. \n\nAfew hints and tips to the fellow PGs, Always keep your doors locked when driving around especially at night time and if somebody bump into your vehicle from behind. DO NOT come out of your car straight away. Keep your doors locked, look around, quickly assess the situation and then decide whether it’s safe to come out or not. If not, and if necessary to flight, then do not be ashamed or hesitate to press your foot down and fly. DO NOT TRY TO BE A HERO. That’s what they say here in the British Police training. We back home, meaning in Pakistan often bring “ghairath” into everything little thing and try to employ this word “ghairath” or pride in the wrong places simply where there is no need.\n\nGod Bless us All.[/QUOTE]\nGood assesment sir....indeed we have to learn how to discern the howlers from the stalkers....thats where conflict management comes in.', 1, 0, '182.186.101.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Second, this discussion is [B]strictly limited[/B] to whether a gun owner should carry a gun chambered or not; in no way is this a discussion about when to shoot, or what the legal repercussions of an active shooting are, etc. Therefore, [B]please be polite[/B] and, agree or disagree, do express your thoughts on the matter.[/I]\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was on the receiving end of a very passionate lecture about the horrors and pitfalls of carrying a gun chambered. The "lecturer" was a very senior and experienced firearms enthusiast who even cited a few unfortunate examples of why a chambered gun is a liability with potentially fatal consequences. According to the gentleman, people who carry chambered are [B]"highly irresponsible, pumped up yahoos and wanna-be Rambo''s who have absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions!"[/B] Strong words indeed! So strong, in fact, that I was completely stunned into silence by the tone and "logic" that was being used to vilify carrying a chambered firearm.\n\nInitially, I had decided to let the matter go; after all, it was just one opinion (albeit a very strong one) and I was free to disagree and ignore it. But realizing the seniority of the gentleman gave me pause in my dismissal of his point of view, and I started thinking about what he had said. Going over the entire "lecture" in my mind, I realized that the gentleman''s entire anti-chambered argument was based, ultimately, on the premise that a typical gun owner is simply not competent enough to carry a chambered gun. In other words, a typical gun owner is irresponsible and is incapable of being trusted to carry a chambered firearm (which, by the way, is how the rest of the world carries a firearm). So that got me thinking: what is it exactly about us Pakistanis that makes us utterly unable to follow a few simple gun safety rules while the rest of the world continues to do so without hesitation? Could it be that, since the gun safety rules were written in English, our understanding of the gora''s language is extremely lacking? Or perhaps we still adhere to our rebellious ways against the colonialist gora and his damnable rules? Or maybe we just simply don''t care?\n\nI racked my brain for almost a week but just couldn''t figure it out. So then I tried a different approach; I tried to examine the various points of the gentleman''s argument and see if they hold any logical merit. In that I was met with with a measure of success.\n\nThe following are the salient points of the anti-chambered debate and my side of the argument.\n\nMind you, I am writing this because of the great respect I have for the gentleman.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n1) A CHAMBERED GUN IS DANGEROUS[/B][/COLOR]\nSuppose one day you come home from a long day at the office. You''re tired, hungry and can''t wait to get some sleep. So you get home, rush up to your bedroom, put your chambered pistol on the night stand and jump into the shower. A few moments later, your 5-year old son strolls into your room and sees your gun. He picks it up and starts playing with it, thinking it''s a toy. Suddenly his finger slips on to the trigger, and he squeezes...\n\nSurely, for many of us, this is possibly the worst nightmare we can imagine. The question that begs to be asked is, where exactly does the blame for such a tragedy lie? The gun? The child? The chambered round? No, on all accounts. [B]The real blame lies at your feet, the irresponsible gun owner.[/B] Whether you have children or not, or even if you live completely alone, the cardinal principle of firearms is that [B]guns are dangerous objects and, as such, need to be treated with the utmost care and respect.[/B]\n\nWe''ve all heard of multiple incidents where a gun owner, while cleaning his gun, accidentally shot himself. Apparently the hapless victim did not clear his gun properly. So, in these unfortunate instances, where does the blame lie? The gun? The cleaning equipment? The chambered round, perhaps? Again, the answer is no on all accounts. [B]The actual blames lies with the irresponsible gun owner who did a sloppy job of clearing his gun.[/B]\n\nOh, and a piece of advice; by ejecting the magazine and racking the slide a couple of times does [B]NOT[/B] mean that you''ve safely cleared your gun! Instead, you also need to [B]physically[/B] ensure that the gun is clear by [B]locking back the slide, looking through the ejection port to make sure that there is no magazine in the gun and then sticking your pinky finger into the chamber to make sure that there''s no round in the chamber either.[/B] And please, for the love of God, [B]don''t point the gun at anybody or anything you''re not willing to shoot![/B]\n\n[B]Remember, nothing in this world will kill you faster than complacency.[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n2) RACKING THE SLIDE TAKES NO TIME[/B][/COLOR]\nTell me, what''s faster & requires less of an effort; [B]racking the slide or pulling the trigger?[/B]\n\nNo matter how fast you are, no matter how quick your draw, the trigger finger will [B]ALWAYS[/B] be infinitely faster than the racking arm. I have personally come face to face with a loaded gun, and the [B]ONLY[/B] reason I''m sitting at home, happily typing away at my keyboard this very instant, is because by the time the jackass racked his slide, my chambered gun was pointing straight at his face [B](even though he drew his gun first!)[/B].\n\nSure, you can say that I have a personal bias in favor of a chambered gun. [B]Considering that I''m alive because of a chambered gun, hell yeah I''m biased![/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n3) A CHAMBERED GUN CAN GO OFF ANYTIME[/B][/COLOR]\nWhat part of [B]"Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target"[/B] is so difficult to understand?\n\nIf, for some inexplicable reason, you find yourself constantly & needlessly fondling the trigger, then either get a gun with a manual safety [B](and keep the safety on at all times!)[/B] or, better still, [B]you stay as far away from guns as possible![/B]\n\nThis argument point, however, once more underscores the fact that [B]the chambered gun is considered "dangerous" simply because of an utter lack of respect for the gun safety laws!\n[/B]\nMy grandfather once told me, [B]the day you don''t respect your gun, is the day your gun will kill you.[/B]\n\n[B]\n[COLOR=#ff0000]4) A CHAMBERED GUN IS ONLY CARRIED ON A BATTLEFIELD OR IF YOU HAVE "ENEMIES"[/COLOR][/B]\nUnfortunately, we live in a society where the rule of law is nonexistent. Not a day goes by when we don''t read or hear about the lawless chaos that is prevalent in our world. If a [B]law-abiding citizen carries a weapon for the sole purpose of self-defense,[/B] then he must do so under the premise that [B]he might be required to use that weapon at any given moment, in the least amount of time.[/B]\n\nIf we accept that such are the times in which we live, then why are we so reluctant to accept the fact that carrying and deploying a chambered firearm has become a survival necessity? Soldiers carry chambered firearms in a war zone because [B]they may be required to use their firearms at a moment''s notice.[/B] Considering the poor law & order situation in which we live today, [B]how is our situation any different?[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n5) YOU''RE AN ARM CHAIR EXPERT, YOU DON''T KNOW ANYTHING[/B][/COLOR]\nThis term, which has become so en vogue lately, not surprisingly has [B]absolutely no bearing[/B] on the "to chamber or not to chamber" debate.\n\nFor example, if I were to put forward theories on the extractor design of a Mauser Kar98, I would rightfully be labelled an [B]"arm chair expert".[/B] Why? Because I don''t have any [B]experience[/B] with a Kar98.\n\nHowever, unlike the various technicalities of a particular firearm, [B]common sense[/B] requires [B]no[/B] lifetime experience. In fact, [B]a simple mind capable of making logical deductions is all that is needed to make sound judgements. Ergo, the "arm chair expert" just might be the one talking sense.[/B] \n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]6) I''M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE CARRYING A CHAMBERED GUN[/B][/COLOR]\nThis is actually a very understandable point. When I first started carrying a gun, I used to do so with [B]a round in the chamber and the safety on;[/B] I did so because I wanted to [B]get used to carrying a firearm and stay safe as I grew in confidence.[/B] At no point did I [B]ever[/B] consider carrying [B]unchambered[/B] because it just didn''t make sense to me. [B]A round in the chamber is the natural state of an "active" gun.[/B] If you''re not comfortable carrying a chambered firearm, then I personally suggest you start carrying your firearm with the safety on; atleast that will give you a peace of mind and you will slowly gain confidence with your chambered gun.\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]7) PEOPLE WHO CARRYING CHAMBERED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE[/B][/COLOR]\nThis statement has [B]never[/B] made sense to me; [B]how can the state of your self-defense weapon determine the level of your responsibility?[/B] That''s like saying just because I drive a Ferrari, I''m more liable to over-speed and break every single traffic rule in the book!

They were asked to unchamber depending on the setting and activity. There was no immediate threat that could not be handled by an unchambered weapon.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear friend, here is what I don''t understand about that situation, why would you make him remove the chambered round only?\nSince you''ve already stated that [quote]There was no immediate threat that could not be handled by an unchambered weapon.[/QUOTE]That means you admit that a situation could arise needing a firearm to be deployed, but your willing to presume that a chambered round(or the lack of it) will not Effect the outcome of the scenario.\nHere is my problem with that \n1. You are suggesting that Either a chambered weapon is somehow Inherently more dangerous than an un-chambered one ( i.e weapons can discharge on their own) or you don''t trust the operator . However either way the presumption is guns can be made more safe, by un-chambering the round.\nIF you take the firearm alone, a chambered modern firearm is no more dangerous than an un-chambered one, Guns simple don''t / can''t let off rounds on their own. ( I''m presuming you understand why that is, or maybe you don''t believe that statement is true)\nThat leaves the situation that you don''t trust the operator, in that case shouldn''t you ask them to disarm. ( if I don''t trust someone''s driving, I don''t let them drive )    \n\n2.[quote]Now if I was in Libya or an extremely violent situation I would definitely carry a chambered weapon, no doubt about it. But carrying one in the tube to a social function does not make a lick of sense to me.[/quote]\nSo let me get this Straight: you admit that if you actually needed to ''use your firearm'' in an ''extremely violent'' situation  carrying Chambered is better ( would be your mode of carry ) [b]Do people become more reliable/dependable ( safe operator''s ) , or do guns become inherently more Safe in such ''violent situations''?[/b] that to me doesn''t make any sense.\nSince no-one really know''s where and when our enemies ( thieves, robber''s, kidnappers, terrorists, religious nut job''s ) may show up, souldn''t you always be carrying a firearm in a ready to use state.\n\n[B]Efficiency in general describes accomplishment of or ability to accomplish a job with a minimum expenditure of time and effort. It is often used with the specific purpose of relaying the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome effectively with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.[/B]\n\nHere''s my opinion: People tend to believe Firearms themselves are Inherently Dangerous ( they hv a mind of their own and can shoot people on their own).\nHowever scientifically and objectively, a Chambered handgun is no more Dangerous than an UNchambered one.\nA chambered Firearm is Just a more Efficient tool at its intended purpose. \nStick to the 4 laws of firearm safety and and in most cases even if you mistakenly by-pass one, the other 3 will keep you safe (i.e you pressed the trigger but the gun was pointed in a safe direction ....no dmg done thankfully etc etc )\nCarry as you please, But learn to carry as Efficiently as you can ( if it takes you more than 5-10 sec''s to deploy you firearm , you need more practice and you need to look into or change your mode/ method of carry )\n\n@ OP  AHnab I agree with you pretty much All the way .', 1, 0, '182.177.140.161', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Second, this discussion is [B]strictly limited[/B] to whether a gun owner should carry a gun chambered or not; in no way is this a discussion about when to shoot, or what the legal repercussions of an active shooting are, etc. Therefore, [B]please be polite[/B] and, agree or disagree, do express your thoughts on the matter.[/I]\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was on the receiving end of a very passionate lecture about the horrors and pitfalls of carrying a gun chambered. The "lecturer" was a very senior and experienced firearms enthusiast who even cited a few unfortunate examples of why a chambered gun is a liability with potentially fatal consequences. According to the gentleman, people who carry chambered are [B]"highly irresponsible, pumped up yahoos and wanna-be Rambo''s who have absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions!"[/B] Strong words indeed! So strong, in fact, that I was completely stunned into silence by the tone and "logic" that was being used to vilify carrying a chambered firearm.\n\nInitially, I had decided to let the matter go; after all, it was just one opinion (albeit a very strong one) and I was free to disagree and ignore it. But realizing the seniority of the gentleman gave me pause in my dismissal of his point of view, and I started thinking about what he had said. Going over the entire "lecture" in my mind, I realized that the gentleman''s entire anti-chambered argument was based, ultimately, on the premise that a typical gun owner is simply not competent enough to carry a chambered gun. In other words, a typical gun owner is irresponsible and is incapable of being trusted to carry a chambered firearm (which, by the way, is how the rest of the world carries a firearm). So that got me thinking: what is it exactly about us Pakistanis that makes us utterly unable to follow a few simple gun safety rules while the rest of the world continues to do so without hesitation? Could it be that, since the gun safety rules were written in English, our understanding of the gora''s language is extremely lacking? Or perhaps we still adhere to our rebellious ways against the colonialist gora and his damnable rules? Or maybe we just simply don''t care?\n\nI racked my brain for almost a week but just couldn''t figure it out. So then I tried a different approach; I tried to examine the various points of the gentleman''s argument and see if they hold any logical merit. In that I was met with with a measure of success.\n\nThe following are the salient points of the anti-chambered debate and my side of the argument.\n\nMind you, I am writing this because of the great respect I have for the gentleman.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n1) A CHAMBERED GUN IS DANGEROUS[/B][/COLOR]\nSuppose one day you come home from a long day at the office. You''re tired, hungry and can''t wait to get some sleep. So you get home, rush up to your bedroom, put your chambered pistol on the night stand and jump into the shower. A few moments later, your 5-year old son strolls into your room and sees your gun. He picks it up and starts playing with it, thinking it''s a toy. Suddenly his finger slips on to the trigger, and he squeezes...\n\nSurely, for many of us, this is possibly the worst nightmare we can imagine. The question that begs to be asked is, where exactly does the blame for such a tragedy lie? The gun? The child? The chambered round? No, on all accounts. [B]The real blame lies at your feet, the irresponsible gun owner.[/B] Whether you have children or not, or even if you live completely alone, the cardinal principle of firearms is that [B]guns are dangerous objects and, as such, need to be treated with the utmost care and respect.[/B]\n\nWe''ve all heard of multiple incidents where a gun owner, while cleaning his gun, accidentally shot himself. Apparently the hapless victim did not clear his gun properly. So, in these unfortunate instances, where does the blame lie? The gun? The cleaning equipment? The chambered round, perhaps? Again, the answer is no on all accounts. [B]The actual blames lies with the irresponsible gun owner who did a sloppy job of clearing his gun.[/B]\n\nOh, and a piece of advice; by ejecting the magazine and racking the slide a couple of times does [B]NOT[/B] mean that you''ve safely cleared your gun! Instead, you also need to [B]physically[/B] ensure that the gun is clear by [B]locking back the slide, looking through the ejection port to make sure that there is no magazine in the gun and then sticking your pinky finger into the chamber to make sure that there''s no round in the chamber either.[/B] And please, for the love of God, [B]don''t point the gun at anybody or anything you''re not willing to shoot![/B]\n\n[B]Remember, nothing in this world will kill you faster than complacency.[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n2) RACKING THE SLIDE TAKES NO TIME[/B][/COLOR]\nTell me, what''s faster & requires less of an effort; [B]racking the slide or pulling the trigger?[/B]\n\nNo matter how fast you are, no matter how quick your draw, the trigger finger will [B]ALWAYS[/B] be infinitely faster than the racking arm. I have personally come face to face with a loaded gun, and the [B]ONLY[/B] reason I''m sitting at home, happily typing away at my keyboard this very instant, is because by the time the jackass racked his slide, my chambered gun was pointing straight at his face [B](even though he drew his gun first!)[/B].\n\nSure, you can say that I have a personal bias in favor of a chambered gun. [B]Considering that I''m alive because of a chambered gun, hell yeah I''m biased![/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n3) A CHAMBERED GUN CAN GO OFF ANYTIME[/B][/COLOR]\nWhat part of [B]"Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target"[/B] is so difficult to understand?\n\nIf, for some inexplicable reason, you find yourself constantly & needlessly fondling the trigger, then either get a gun with a manual safety [B](and keep the safety on at all times!)[/B] or, better still, [B]you stay as far away from guns as possible![/B]\n\nThis argument point, however, once more underscores the fact that [B]the chambered gun is considered "dangerous" simply because of an utter lack of respect for the gun safety laws!\n[/B]\nMy grandfather once told me, [B]the day you don''t respect your gun, is the day your gun will kill you.[/B]\n\n[B]\n[COLOR=#ff0000]4) A CHAMBERED GUN IS ONLY CARRIED ON A BATTLEFIELD OR IF YOU HAVE "ENEMIES"[/COLOR][/B]\nUnfortunately, we live in a society where the rule of law is nonexistent. Not a day goes by when we don''t read or hear about the lawless chaos that is prevalent in our world. If a [B]law-abiding citizen carries a weapon for the sole purpose of self-defense,[/B] then he must do so under the premise that [B]he might be required to use that weapon at any given moment, in the least amount of time.[/B]\n\nIf we accept that such are the times in which we live, then why are we so reluctant to accept the fact that carrying and deploying a chambered firearm has become a survival necessity? Soldiers carry chambered firearms in a war zone because [B]they may be required to use their firearms at a moment''s notice.[/B] Considering the poor law & order situation in which we live today, [B]how is our situation any different?[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n5) YOU''RE AN ARM CHAIR EXPERT, YOU DON''T KNOW ANYTHING[/B][/COLOR]\nThis term, which has become so en vogue lately, not surprisingly has [B]absolutely no bearing[/B] on the "to chamber or not to chamber" debate.\n\nFor example, if I were to put forward theories on the extractor design of a Mauser Kar98, I would rightfully be labelled an [B]"arm chair expert".[/B] Why? Because I don''t have any [B]experience[/B] with a Kar98.\n\nHowever, unlike the various technicalities of a particular firearm, [B]common sense[/B] requires [B]no[/B] lifetime experience. In fact, [B]a simple mind capable of making logical deductions is all that is needed to make sound judgements. Ergo, the "arm chair expert" just might be the one talking sense.[/B] \n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]6) I''M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE CARRYING A CHAMBERED GUN[/B][/COLOR]\nThis is actually a very understandable point. When I first started carrying a gun, I used to do so with [B]a round in the chamber and the safety on;[/B] I did so because I wanted to [B]get used to carrying a firearm and stay safe as I grew in confidence.[/B] At no point did I [B]ever[/B] consider carrying [B]unchambered[/B] because it just didn''t make sense to me. [B]A round in the chamber is the natural state of an "active" gun.[/B] If you''re not comfortable carrying a chambered firearm, then I personally suggest you start carrying your firearm with the safety on; atleast that will give you a peace of mind and you will slowly gain confidence with your chambered gun.\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]7) PEOPLE WHO CARRYING CHAMBERED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE[/B][/COLOR]\nThis statement has [B]never[/B] made sense to me; [B]how can the state of your self-defense weapon determine the level of your responsibility?[/B] That''s like saying just because I drive a Ferrari, I''m more liable to over-speed and break every single traffic rule in the book! Responsibility lies with the [B]human operator[/B] and [B]NOT[/B] the inanimate object! [B]YOU[/B] are responsible for [B]all [/B]your actions! [B]YOU[/B] are accountable for the use & misuse of your firearm! If you suffer from a bout of temporary insanity or blinding rage, even an [B]unloaded[/B] gun is dangerous in your hands!\n\nThe first rule of gun ownership is to have a [B]very balanced mindset[/B] and to [B]be completely aware of the consequences of your actions.[/B][B] In no way can you make a logical defense of irresponsible actions by simply saying that a "chambered round made me do it!"[/B] If you''re going to own (let alone carry) a firearm, then [B]accept the great responsibility that comes with it![/B]\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]CONCLUSION[/B][/COLOR]\nI own & carry a gun strictly for protecting my life and the lives of my loved ones. I carry a chambered gun whenever I leave the house and I have a chambered gun next to my bed when I go to sleep. I have no enemies, yet my own chambered gun once saved my life from a random instance of sheer terror. Law-abiding citizens all over the world carry their defense weapons chambered; I really can''t figure out why we are so reluctant to do so! I''ve said this on numerous occasions that "a round in the pipe" is the proper way of carrying a self-defense firearm, and I hope I''ve managed to get my point across.

I can write all night long discussing game theory models with you but I would rather cut to the chase, you are a smart man. here we go:\r\n\r\nmost handgun related incidents occur (A) when the victim is never aware of the situation. if you are not aware, you might as well carry a hand grenade with the pin between your teeth, it would be a futile exercise. or (B) when the victim is fully aware of the situation. in that case, you can even wrap the gun in stretch film (burlap if you prefer otherwise) and would still have time to be ready to face that threat.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]3) A CHAMBERED GUN CAN GO OFF ANYTIME\r\nWhat part of [B]"Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target"[/B] is so difficult to understand?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, if exercising caution is a universally practiced idea/concept then why do all potentially hazardous machinery/tools have dead man safties/switches?\r\n\r\nwhy do some cars constantly beep every few seconds (till your head explodes) if you dont wear seat belt? is this me or the manufacturer thinks that all drivers are prone to mistakes. its the human condition bro. everybody is prone to mistakes. its not all about knowing gun safety laws.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]7) PEOPLE WHO CARRYING CHAMBERED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE[/B][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nNo!

I know most modern firearms have drop safeties but you know what they say: if something can go wrong, it will.\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\nlet me disagree here , This mindset is the actual problem, people still believe that firearms can discharge by dropping , etc, when they hv been tested and proven to be incapable of that for a long time now ( long guns are an exception ) or Firearms with a round in the chamber are dangerous because they can ''on their own '' go off for one reason or the other. \nThe only thing that has been over stated in that regard is the saying ''if something can go wrong, it will .... in reality though it rarely ever does ( or else we would all have cleft lips and extra appendages )   \nIts Mechanically improbable for a weapon to discharge, that carries a firing pin block with out the trigger being pulled.( this is now a scientific Fact) But for some reason People, generally Older shooter''s stick to their convictions.( Sorta like the Steel vs plastic guns debate, never mind the fact that from Nasa space shuttles to modern car''s everything is now moving in the direction of the composite material ) \nIs there a remote /freak accident possibility ? Yeah , pretty much the same possibilities of the Brakes of you car completely Failing ( that would imply you should always drive your car under 20 miles an hour, in-case your brakes fail, under 20 will ensure that if you pull your foot off the gas, the car will roll to a stop), or you getting hit bit by a meteor ( carry an umbrella ? )\nNow can Some1 pls tell me how many cases of Brake failures are reported every year in modern cars? or meteor showers ? Also the same group of people believe de-cocker''s are also unsafe, I have never heard, of a Sig discharging a round due to de-cocker failing.\n\nlet me State for the benefit of all once again : for all practical reasons Modern firearms can''t discharge on their own , without some1 pressing the trigger.\nThere was this Story on the interweb''s about a bullet falling off the table and going Boom. I guess an unchambered gun with rounds in a mag is unsafe too [ extrapolating that (ill)logic] \n\n[quote]you are taking this advise out of context bro. Ofcourse racking a slide takes time. it is not possible in this universe to perform an action without sometime associated with it, now matter how small.\n\nhowever in its true form "racking the slide takes no time" means that whatever you can achieve by simply turning the safety off before pointing the gun at your target, you can also achieve the same by racking the slide and pointing the gun at the target.

Second, this discussion is [B]strictly limited[/B] to whether a gun owner should carry a gun chambered or not; in no way is this a discussion about when to shoot, or what the legal repercussions of an active shooting are, etc. Therefore, [B]please be polite[/B] and, agree or disagree, do express your thoughts on the matter.[/I]\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was on the receiving end of a very passionate lecture about the horrors and pitfalls of carrying a gun chambered. The "lecturer" was a very senior and experienced firearms enthusiast who even cited a few unfortunate examples of why a chambered gun is a liability with potentially fatal consequences. According to the gentleman, people who carry chambered are [B]"highly irresponsible, pumped up yahoos and wanna-be Rambo''s who have absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions!"[/B] Strong words indeed! So strong, in fact, that I was completely stunned into silence by the tone and "logic" that was being used to vilify carrying a chambered firearm.\n\nInitially, I had decided to let the matter go; after all, it was just one opinion (albeit a very strong one) and I was free to disagree and ignore it. But realizing the seniority of the gentleman gave me pause in my dismissal of his point of view, and I started thinking about what he had said. Going over the entire "lecture" in my mind, I realized that the gentleman''s entire anti-chambered argument was based, ultimately, on the premise that a typical gun owner is simply not competent enough to carry a chambered gun. In other words, a typical gun owner is irresponsible and is incapable of being trusted to carry a chambered firearm (which, by the way, is how the rest of the world carries a firearm). So that got me thinking: what is it exactly about us Pakistanis that makes us utterly unable to follow a few simple gun safety rules while the rest of the world continues to do so without hesitation? Could it be that, since the gun safety rules were written in English, our understanding of the gora''s language is extremely lacking? Or perhaps we still adhere to our rebellious ways against the colonialist gora and his damnable rules? Or maybe we just simply don''t care?\n\nI racked my brain for almost a week but just couldn''t figure it out. So then I tried a different approach; I tried to examine the various points of the gentleman''s argument and see if they hold any logical merit. In that I was met with with a measure of success.\n\nThe following are the salient points of the anti-chambered debate and my side of the argument.\n\nMind you, I am writing this because of the great respect I have for the gentleman.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n1) A CHAMBERED GUN IS DANGEROUS[/B][/COLOR]\nSuppose one day you come home from a long day at the office. You''re tired, hungry and can''t wait to get some sleep. So you get home, rush up to your bedroom, put your chambered pistol on the night stand and jump into the shower. A few moments later, your 5-year old son strolls into your room and sees your gun. He picks it up and starts playing with it, thinking it''s a toy. Suddenly his finger slips on to the trigger, and he squeezes...\n\nSurely, for many of us, this is possibly the worst nightmare we can imagine. The question that begs to be asked is, where exactly does the blame for such a tragedy lie? The gun? The child? The chambered round? No, on all accounts. [B]The real blame lies at your feet, the irresponsible gun owner.[/B] Whether you have children or not, or even if you live completely alone, the cardinal principle of firearms is that [B]guns are dangerous objects and, as such, need to be treated with the utmost care and respect.[/B]\n\nWe''ve all heard of multiple incidents where a gun owner, while cleaning his gun, accidentally shot himself. Apparently the hapless victim did not clear his gun properly. So, in these unfortunate instances, where does the blame lie? The gun? The cleaning equipment? The chambered round, perhaps? Again, the answer is no on all accounts. [B]The actual blames lies with the irresponsible gun owner who did a sloppy job of clearing his gun.[/B]\n\nOh, and a piece of advice; by ejecting the magazine and racking the slide a couple of times does [B]NOT[/B] mean that you''ve safely cleared your gun! Instead, you also need to [B]physically[/B] ensure that the gun is clear by [B]locking back the slide, looking through the ejection port to make sure that there is no magazine in the gun and then sticking your pinky finger into the chamber to make sure that there''s no round in the chamber either.[/B] And please, for the love of God, [B]don''t point the gun at anybody or anything you''re not willing to shoot![/B]\n\n[B]Remember, nothing in this world will kill you faster than complacency.[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n2) RACKING THE SLIDE TAKES NO TIME[/B][/COLOR]\nTell me, what''s faster & requires less of an effort; [B]racking the slide or pulling the trigger?[/B]\n\nNo matter how fast you are, no matter how quick your draw, the trigger finger will [B]ALWAYS[/B] be infinitely faster than the racking arm. I have personally come face to face with a loaded gun, and the [B]ONLY[/B] reason I''m sitting at home, happily typing away at my keyboard this very instant, is because by the time the jackass racked his slide, my chambered gun was pointing straight at his face [B](even though he drew his gun first!)[/B].\n\nSure, you can say that I have a personal bias in favor of a chambered gun. [B]Considering that I''m alive because of a chambered gun, hell yeah I''m biased![/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n3) A CHAMBERED GUN CAN GO OFF ANYTIME[/B][/COLOR]\nWhat part of [B]"Gun Safety Rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger till your gun is pointing at the target"[/B] is so difficult to understand?\n\nIf, for some inexplicable reason, you find yourself constantly & needlessly fondling the trigger, then either get a gun with a manual safety [B](and keep the safety on at all times!)[/B] or, better still, [B]you stay as far away from guns as possible![/B]\n\nThis argument point, however, once more underscores the fact that [B]the chambered gun is considered "dangerous" simply because of an utter lack of respect for the gun safety laws!\n[/B]\nMy grandfather once told me, [B]the day you don''t respect your gun, is the day your gun will kill you.[/B]\n\n[B]\n[COLOR=#ff0000]4) A CHAMBERED GUN IS ONLY CARRIED ON A BATTLEFIELD OR IF YOU HAVE "ENEMIES"[/COLOR][/B]\nUnfortunately, we live in a society where the rule of law is nonexistent. Not a day goes by when we don''t read or hear about the lawless chaos that is prevalent in our world. If a [B]law-abiding citizen carries a weapon for the sole purpose of self-defense,[/B] then he must do so under the premise that [B]he might be required to use that weapon at any given moment, in the least amount of time.[/B]\n\nIf we accept that such are the times in which we live, then why are we so reluctant to accept the fact that carrying and deploying a chambered firearm has become a survival necessity? Soldiers carry chambered firearms in a war zone because [B]they may be required to use their firearms at a moment''s notice.[/B] Considering the poor law & order situation in which we live today, [B]how is our situation any different?[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]\n5) YOU''RE AN ARM CHAIR EXPERT, YOU DON''T KNOW ANYTHING[/B][/COLOR]\nThis term, which has become so en vogue lately, not surprisingly has [B]absolutely no bearing[/B] on the "to chamber or not to chamber" debate.\n\nFor example, if I were to put forward theories on the extractor design of a Mauser Kar98, I would rightfully be labelled an [B]"arm chair expert".[/B] Why? Because I don''t have any [B]experience[/B] with a Kar98.\n\nHowever, unlike the various technicalities of a particular firearm, [B]common sense[/B] requires [B]no[/B] lifetime experience. In fact, [B]a simple mind capable of making logical deductions is all that is needed to make sound judgements. Ergo, the "arm chair expert" just might be the one talking sense.[/B] \n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]6) I''M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE CARRYING A CHAMBERED GUN[/B][/COLOR]\nThis is actually a very understandable point. When I first started carrying a gun, I used to do so with [B]a round in the chamber and the safety on;[/B] I did so because I wanted to [B]get used to carrying a firearm and stay safe as I grew in confidence.[/B] At no point did I [B]ever[/B] consider carrying [B]unchambered[/B] because it just didn''t make sense to me. [B]A round in the chamber is the natural state of an "active" gun.[/B] If you''re not comfortable carrying a chambered firearm, then I personally suggest you start carrying your firearm with the safety on; atleast that will give you a peace of mind and you will slowly gain confidence with your chambered gun.\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]7) PEOPLE WHO CARRYING CHAMBERED ARE IRRESPONSIBLE[/B][/COLOR]\nThis statement has [B]never[/B] made sense to me; [B]how can the state of your self-defense weapon determine the level of your responsibility?[/B] That''s like saying just because I drive a Ferrari, I''m more liable to over-speed and break every single traffic rule in the book! Responsibility lies with the [B]human operator[/B] and [B]NOT[/B] the inanimate object! [B]YOU[/B] are responsible for [B]all [/B]your actions! [B]YOU[/B] are accountable for the use & misuse of your firearm! If you suffer from a bout of temporary insanity or blinding rage, even an [B]unloaded[/B] gun is dangerous in your hands!\n\nThe first rule of gun ownership is to have a [B]very balanced mindset[/B] and to [B]be completely aware of the consequences of your actions.[/B][B] In no way can you make a logical defense of irresponsible actions by simply saying that a "chambered round made me do it!"[/B] If you''re going to own (let alone carry) a firearm, then [B]accept the great responsibility that comes with it![/B]\n\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]CONCLUSION[/B][/COLOR]\nI own & carry a gun strictly for protecting my life and the lives of my loved ones. I carry a chambered gun whenever I leave the house and I have a chambered gun next to my bed when I go to sleep. I have no enemies, yet my own chambered gun once saved my life from a random instance of sheer terror. Law-abiding citizens all over the world carry their defense weapons chambered; I really can''t figure out why we are so reluctant to do so! I''ve said this on numerous occasions that "a round in the pipe" is the proper way of carrying a self-defense firearm, and I hope I''ve managed to get my point across.

I have been thinking that instead of selling the PG merchandise at a cost how about we promote a sense of association instead of sense of ownership by selling them at discount?\r\n\r\nwhat I am trying to say is that instead of promoting the idea that members are buying an item/cap, we give an impression that they are becoming part of something.\r\n\r\nhow about we base price the black caps at 400/each. that is we give discount of 100 in the base price. then we add Option B shipping charges to it. now total price per cap of the back one comes at 400 plus 150 = 550.\r\n\r\nwith that, we add a premium of 100 to the base price of orange cap. now base price of the orange cap would be 600. add shipping 150 and we''ll have 750 price per cap.\r\n\r\nwhy I am doing this is because, we are using black caps to promote sense of association whereas since the orange cap (high visibility hunter orange) is very very very hard to come by and the ones that are available at hunting stores in extremely limited quantity usually cost somewhere in the vicinity of 4-5K. so any member who is exclusive looking for a hunting cap would be more than happy to pay 750 rupees for a tool/cap. similar principle we saw at work while selling PG shooting/hunting vests. we gave them higher quality at half the market price. it promoted association by way of cash savings and better quality. same can be our pitch here. we have special high visibility cloth that was specifically colored in limited quantity as per our specifications. the cloth has been thoroughly tested, it will not stretch out and lose its shape, the bill will stay in its shape even during the rigors of hunt and the color will not fade, wash after wash. the cloth is cotton poly blend specially formulated to withstand wash after wash.\r\n\r\nanyways, am I making any sense?

You are suggesting that Either a chambered weapon is somehow Inherently more dangerous than an un-chambered one ( i.e weapons can discharge on their own) or you don''t trust the operator . However either way the presumption is guns can be made more safe, by un-chambering the round.\nIF you take the firearm alone, a chambered modern firearm is no more dangerous than an un-chambered one, Guns simple don''t / can''t let off rounds on their own. ( I''m presuming you understand why that is, or maybe you don''t believe that statement is true)\nThat leaves the situation that you don''t trust the operator, in that case shouldn''t you ask them to disarm. ( if I don''t trust someone''s driving, I don''t let them drive )    \n\n2.\nSo let me get this Straight: you admit that if you actually needed to ''use your firearm'' in an ''extremely violent'' situation  carrying Chambered is better ( would be your mode of carry ) [B]Do people become more reliable/dependable ( safe operator''s ) , or do guns become inherently more Safe in such ''violent situations''?[/B] that to me doesn''t make any sense.\nSince no-one really know''s where and when our enemies ( thieves, robber''s, kidnappers, terrorists, religious nut job''s ) may show up, souldn''t you always be carrying a firearm in a ready to use state.\n\n[B]Efficiency in general describes accomplishment of or ability to accomplish a job with a minimum expenditure of time and effort. It is often used with the specific purpose of relaying the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome effectively with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.[/B]\n\nHere''s my opinion: People tend to believe Firearms themselves are Inherently Dangerous ( they hv a mind of their own and can shoot people on their own).\nHowever scientifically and objectively, a Chambered handgun is no more Dangerous than an UNchambered one.\nA chambered Firearm is Just a more Efficient tool at its intended purpose. \nStick to the 4 laws of firearm safety and and in most cases even if you mistakenly by-pass one, the other 3 will keep you safe (i.e you pressed the trigger but the gun was pointed in a safe direction ....no dmg done thankfully etc etc )\nCarry as you please, But learn to carry as Efficiently as you can ( if it takes you more than 5-10 sec''s to deploy you firearm , you need more practice and you need to look into or change your mode/ method of carry )\n\n@ OP  AHnab I agree with you pretty much All the way .[/QUOTE]\n\nFirstly, when asking someone to unchamber a weapon I usually dont let them point it at my face and enjoy. The precaution taken when unchambering a round should be clear to all that visit this website. Whether they follow those rules or not is something I would leave upto them. Everyone that I interact with ranks and files in one category when around loved ones. When I am visiting a picnic spot by the lake in the States with no wildlife or dakaits why would anyone have a chambered weapon? I do not live in a violent surrounding or have enemies. The only enemy that day would be an accidental discharge no matter how low the probability of that happening is. My defense doctrine revolves around unchambered weapon to be chambered when danger is present. I do not think I will get in a quick draw with a BG. \n\nMaybe it is different for people who say that chambered is the way to go. My philosophy to trust metal and springs might be different than yours, dosnt mean that yours is wrong. It just means it is just another way to do things. I am not a paranoid person, but I am realistic as well. You could go through the list and answer the questions yourself as well. \n\n1) What is the probability of any chambered weapon going off?\n2) What are the leading causes of chambered weapons going off?\n3) What is the probability of "your" chambered weapon going off?\n4) What is the probability of someone elses chambered weapon going off?\n5) What is the probability of an unchambered weapon going off?\n6) How long does it take you to rack the slide?\n\nI wish I could explain better but since I am not arguing with you I just tried to explain how other people go on with their lives successfully without having to deal with a life altering mechanical failure. Everyone I meet does not present their weapons for inspection or if it has a decocker present.

Why don''t you consider upgrading his designation, because a lot of new members on PG including me don''t give a shit to a new member with only 71 posts.

And every 1 has a right to their opinion, I Hope I am not coming across as being rude, and I apologize before hand, if some one felt I was being disrespectful.\n\n[QUOTE=forcetrip;302736] When I am visiting a picnic spot by the lake in the States with no wildlife or dakaits why would anyone have a chambered weapon? I do not live in a violent surrounding or have enemies. The only enemy that day would be an accidental discharge no matter how low the probability of that happening is. My defense doctrine revolves around unchambered weapon to be chambered when danger is present. I do not think I will get in a quick draw with a BG. \n[/QUOTE]\nSir I can whole heartedly respect that, You live in a place where you "Believe" you are Safe. You hv no enemies and your surroundings are non-violent. If in such a condition, the only "Enemy" is an AD, Why carry a Firearm in the first place. This is the same logic Anti gun lobbyists use.\nI think the problem is this illusion of Safety we live in.\nAgain I''m repeating Myself here : If I carry a firearm( meaning I am open to the possibility of bad things happening to good people ) , I would prefer to carry it in the most Efficient ( and still safe method) as I can, Chambered Modern handguns are as a matter of Fact as safe as a completely unloaded Firearm with no magazine in it. They are Functionally Inert for all purposes un-less Made to fire by intentionally pulling the trigger ( and/ or disengaging a safety before hand )  \n            \n[QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;302738]\nAn after literally years of discussions and debates. I am at peace with my solution as regards my primary CC weapon. Took delivery today.[/QUOTE]\nED bro, so now you carry a weapon with no external safety, de-cocker, loaded chamber indicator and you still feel its safe to carry.\nI''m not sure if this weapon has a ''Transfer bar'' . is it Drop safe? Will you be carrying this by leaving the top cylinder in front of the hammer empty. How many rounds does that leave you with.  \nHow are Glocks, caracal, CZ''s more [b]Inherently[/b] unsafe than this setup .\nHowever thanks for Bringing the Revolver into this discussion, for hundreds of years people carry revolvers Loaded and ready to go with a steady trigger pull, how are auto pistols more unsafe when they are ''Mechanically'' made to hv at-least 3 safeties minimum.\nPeople who would find themselves in frequent confrontations used to cut out the front of the trigger guard to make their firearm even more Efficient. [b] Modern Locked and loaded/ chambered Firearms are simply more Efficient while Still being insanely Safe (more safe than their predecessors ). That''s what Ahnab was trying to say in essence and I concur [/b]  \nSo your recent purchase has me confused. So did you reconsider you original stance?\nAgain however pls let me restate : Modern firearms are Very Safe irrespective of the Carry conditioning. You should be more concerned about getting hit by lightening.\n\nOn a side note on mindset : People that Believe that their firearms are in a ''safe condition'' , in some cases Behave like baboons with them, pointing and playing with them more Often than those that believe they are ready to go , This is entirely my observation.\nLoaded/ unloaded, Chambered/unchamebred, External safeties/no external safety are all entirely irrelevant , The Four Rules of firearm safety will generally keep you and you surroundings safe from an AD/ND while keeping your firearm Fully functional for its intended purpose. That''s simply what I believe, and I know Of no Firearm instructor that teaches keeping Empty chambered firearms for SD and carry.\n\nLack of training, or safe methods of carry ( unchambered/unloaded)  are not mutually exclusive to Safety Rules for handling firearms, in fact imo they are irrelevant if you Follow the four rules.\nIf a 2 year old can be taught not to mess around with Electrical outlets, and a 4-5 year old can be taught not to Run with Scissors/knives/pencils while holding them pointed towards the sky.

The logic behind empty chamber firearms is to Prevent a ND. \nAgain the parking sensor''s don''t Fit becuz I actually cannot see my bumpers while parking, and I appreciate those things.

That''s just how they work , similarly a gun wont work unless you pull the trigger.\nThe fire extinguisher pin is also meant to make it operational, not much different from an external safety on a firearm. \nin all honestly Sir with all due respect, I  understand what your implying, But an empty chambered weapon is not an Additional safety ( scientifically and empirically ) ,  in my opinion it is just a Disability like the Old Russian TT 30 / mak pouch holsters, a bad disabling design.      \n\nP.S I do fancy cars :) appreciate you noticing that, that single comment for some reason brought a smile to my face :)', 1, 0, '182.177.140.161', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When I leave the house, I don''t expect to walk into a situation where one minute I''m enjoying a latte and the next minute I''m trading rounds with a BG. However, that''s kinda exactly what happened to me in January this year. You can read all about it here:\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?8193-Walk-with-Humility-but-carry-a-Big-Stick[/URL]!\n\nAnd regarding the story about the soldier who accidentally shot his friend, the culprit was the brain-dead soldier himself, not the gun or the chambered round. No matter how you look at it, the ultimate responsibility lies with the shooter who, for whatever reason, managed to break practically every single gun safety rule out there.\n\nOwning a gun, let alone carrying one, is a tremendous responsibility.\n\nI think carrying a self-defense gun chambered is the ideal condition considering you never know what kind of nasty surprises life is going to throw your way.\n\nAs I had mentioned in my post, nothing will get you killed faster than  complacency; the day you stop respecting your gun, is the day your gun  will kill you.[/QUOTE]\n\nThat is my point exactly. I cannot vouch for anyone but myself and my firearm. With multiple people having loaded firearms it is just better to take a step down on preparedness. It is definitely a give some take some initiative. I dont increase the risk to my life getting shot by a BG to a certain amount than I save for an unwarranted accident be it by human error or mechanical failure. I understand everyone''s point as to how they would like to react in a confrontation but many of us are well versed in keeping our witts and returning fire from an unchambered gun just as well as a chambered one. Again that is a personal preference and people who come to our family occasions follow those rules or they could feel safer by not coming. Plus the soldier story just happened today so thought it was worth mentioning. Brain dead people are everywhere, this happened by someone who has been knocked the gun rules repeatedly.

Naveed bhai was kind enough to take time from his busy schedule and  we started looking for saiga. There were only two pieces available in  the market and the shopkeepers were charging very high prices. So we  ended up buying this gun. Because only these two guns are available in  Pakistan with removable mags, we have to compare them with each other.  Although there is no comparison of Saiga with Akdal [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/images/smilies/smile.png[/IMG].  Saiga 12 is way out of its league. The Akdal Mka1919 comes in a cheap  cardboard box and the packing is very un impressive.

(303101, 9853, 302486, 'Abbas', 1, '', 1348680420, '[QUOTE=Ahnab;302486]\nA couple of weeks ago I was on the receiving end of a very passionate lecture about the horrors and pitfalls of carrying a gun chambered. The "lecturer" was a very senior and experienced firearms enthusiast who even cited a few unfortunate examples of why a chambered gun is a liability with potentially fatal consequences. According to the gentleman, people who carry chambered are [B]"highly irresponsible, pumped up yahoos and wanna-be Rambo''s who have absolutely no regard for the consequences of their actions!"[/B] Strong words indeed! So strong, in fact, that I was completely stunned into silence by the tone and "logic" that was being used to vilify carrying a chambered firearm.[/QUOTE]\n\nI plead [B]guilty[/B] to being the lecture delivering senior member in question ;) and I''m happy my words were that strongly received by you brother to make you think about them and start this thread so we can all have a positive and constructive discussion on the topic.\n\nI would like to start off by saying that [B]PakGuns was made to promote SAFE & EDUCATED[/B] gun use. This is the entire theme of our forum. Firearm collecting, firearms maintenance, firearm discussion, shooting, hunting and even our most prized asset of community is ALL [B]secondary [/B]to the core concept on this forum which is [B]SAFE & EDUCATED[/B] use of firearms. \n\nWhat I was trying to explain to friends at the range the other day was in short the following:\n\n1). [B]No matter how experienced, you are human. Accidents will happen[/B]. You can be the # 1 shooter, firearms expert in the world but the day will come more than once when you are physically tired or unwell or your mind is preoccupied and that is the day the mistake will be made. You just have to ''forget'' [U][I][B]once[/B][/I][/U] and that once might well be the last mistake you make.\n\n2). [B]Owning a firearm does not give you a licence to kill[/B]. A lot of brothers tell me stories that this guy came to snatch my cell or wallet and I reached for my gun. I give them a "are you insane look?". There is NEVER NEVER any reason to EVER kill another human being. [B]Period[/B]. The only reason to threaten someone''s life is when they are putting your and your family''s life in immediate danger and even in that situation the [B]PRIMARY[/B] purpose of your firearm is to get you and your loved ones to safety. \n\n3). [B]The "I''m proficient enough to ''pop a cap in the B.G''s a$$'' mentality". [/B]I have time and again stressed that breaking bricks or target shooting at the range does [B]NOT[/B] make a person a professional self defence expert. The bricks or the targets don''t shoot back nor are they providing you with the emotions required to train yourself for self defence shooting. When fear of death and adrenaline are doing a Ussain Bolt in your veins then all your shooting experiance goes out the window. The same hands that shoot X''s at 25m won''t be able to hit a human sized target at 10m. Point being the odds are higher that you will miss (and unintentionally shoot something else) than hit in a SD setting. Please look stats from any shooting incident or skirmish or even wars and try to compare the number of bullets fired with the number of injuries or fatalities, it will give you your odds of success. \n\n4). [B]A Chambered round is not dangerous and you can become experts by reading. [/B]\n\n;)\n\nI really don''t have much to say about the above, my usage of the words "Arm Chair Experts" does make some brothers wince but rest assured it is not directed at anyone personally. My definition of an ArmChair Expert is someone who instead of going out and getting some real life experience sits on the internet, reads a dozen forums and websites and forms an opinion based on what other people are saying. I once received a lengthy talk on self defence shooting and I was impressed enough to ask the brother how many rounds had he shot perfecting his skill and the reply was zero, he had never shot a gun in his life. This is your stereotypical ArmChair expert, all talk and no experience and no substance. It''s the same as having read a book on driving or playing a flight simulator and thinking they are fit to drive or fly. \n\n5). [B]Racking the Slide takes too long. [/B]If you cannot spare a quarter of a second to rack the slide then you should''t be shooting at something in the first place. Where do you think your bullet is going to land if you plan to dedicate 1/4 of a second to target acquisition ? Please try something practical, draw your gun to shoot from your conceal carry position a couple of times, time yourself when you''re racking the slide to first shot vs putting the safety on fire to first shot. Done right and without bias, it will be the same. \n\n6). [B]I have the Safety on, so it''s safe[/B] Any manufactured item comes with a warranty which after a certain time runs out. The warranty itself means if this product fails to perform in the desired manner within x time frame we will repair/replace it. Everything ''can'' fail, (which is why warranty''s exist) I would just rather not trust my life to a piece of metal. If your firearm malfunctions that means your warranty has run out. ;)\n\nThere are quite a few friends who like to carry ''one in the pipe''. It''s fine by me, my job is to recommend something which minimizes the risk a firearm poses to them, their loved ones & the unfortunate passer-by. [B]Please don''t let Paranoia overshadow responsibility[/B]. \n\nI would like to repeat for the record that the [B]SAFE AND EDUCATED[/B] firearms ownership that [B]PakGuns [/B]promotes [B]DEMANDS [/B]that a weapon must [B]only[/B] be carried chambered when the threat is immediate.

I hv a Model 31-1 Smith and Wesson Snubby and its Double action pull is a steady light , I am not sure how many pounds but its lighter than the Double action pull of the CZ 999 by quite a bit, and the hammer isn''t that hard either. Are you sure there is nothing wrong with the springs or something. \nAlso if its that hard, won''t you end up squeezing the trigger pretty hard and putting shots off target ?\n\n[u]Back on topic : [/u]  \nHere is what I still don''t understand (Atleast in my case, can''t say about ED bro''s revolver ) My S&W revolver is more than 40 years old design and does not hv a Hammer block safety i.e it isn''t drop safe, has no manual safety and/or decoker , with a steady pull of the trigger , its ready to go at all times, This is the way historically people hv carried revolvers [b]Far more Often and regularly[/b] than people carry semi auto''s now-a-days and people somehow even now people are of the opinion that a double action pull is Safer than all the mechanical safeties a modern semi auto comes with\n( the Glock has 3 Safeties ) .\nQuestion to ED bro, what if She had dropped it, while touching it ? \nThat to me is a society that is now obsessed with safety( from aggressive pat downs''s at international airports to simple things as excessive administration of antibiotics for all and everything) , it is a good thing, as long as it does not limit effectiveness and efficiency ( and some other stuff which will take this debate in an entirely political- social side )\n[QUOTE=Abbas;303101] \nWhat I was trying to explain to friends at the range the other day was in short the following:\n\n1). [B]No matter how experienced, you are human. Accidents will happen[/B]. You can be the # 1 shooter, firearms expert in the world but the day will come more than once when you are physically tired or unwell or your mind is preoccupied and that is the day the mistake will be made. You just have to ''forget'' [U][I][B]once[/B][/I][/U] and that once might well be the last mistake you make. [/quote]\n\nYes and No, in my opinion, accidents generally are associated with\n1. Lack of discipline( ignoring the 4 laws, because you are too cool to obey laws, keeping your finger on the trigger etc etc ) ,\n2. Lack of consistency (carrying and storing the fire-arm in variable states , and not hving a disciplined approach to unloading and loading a firearm etc etc    \n3.Lack of training.( pretty self explanatory)\n4. Lack of practice after Training. ( Anything that is an Acquired Skill , you will lose proficiency in it with out practice.)\n\nA new (shooter/driver/engineer/doctor/lawyer) is more likely to make mistakes than Older experienced counterpart.(statistically, this does not mean all new people will make mistakes, they Are more likely to make basic mistakes)\n\nFor experienced people : Its when they become Complacent or proud things start to Fall apart.\n \nSimply Jumbling all those into one Statement and rolling it out as  matter of Fact is a little harsh in my opinion.\n\nSince I Fancy car''s here comes another car example, No matter how tiered/ pre-occupied you are, you always end up pulling the keys out of the ignition switch and locking the Doors or your car, this is mostly a subconscious act ( muscle memory if you will )\nIf you Have , trained and practised sufficiently,hv some discipline in your life and you not afflicted by a god complex, you can go through your whole life without any  incident, that is entirely my belief.        \n  \n[Quote]2). [B]Owning a firearm does not give you a licence to kill[/B]. A lot of brothers tell me stories that this guy came to snatch my cell or wallet and I reached for my gun. I give them a "are you insane look?". There is NEVER NEVER any reason to EVER kill another human being. [B]Period[/B]. The only reason to threaten someone''s life is when they are putting your and your family''s life in immediate danger and even in that situation the [B]PRIMARY[/B] purpose of your firearm is to get you and your loved ones to safety. \n\n3). [B]The "I''m proficient enough to ''pop a cap in the B.G''s a$$'' mentality". [/B]I have time and again stressed that breaking bricks or target shooting at the range does [B]NOT[/B] make a person a professional self defence expert. The bricks or the targets don''t shoot back nor are they providing you with the emotions required to train yourself for self defence shooting. When fear of death and adrenaline are doing a Hussain Bolt in your veins then all your shooting experiance goes out the window. The same hands that shoot X''s at 25m won''t be able to hit a human sized target at 10m. Point being the odds are higher that you will miss (and unintentionally shoot something else) than hit in a SD setting. Please look stats from any shooting incident or skirmish or even wars and try to compare the number of bullets fired with the number of injuries or fatalities, it will give you your odds of success. [/quote]\n\nI agree to some extent with that, I can understand people making tall claims about how proficient they are or will be in blah blah situation. Those are simple ego boosters to deflect the anxiety people feel when they think of such situations. I personally doubt any1 is cold blooded.\n[u]However: as Abbas bhai quoted:" even in that situation the [B]PRIMARY[/B] purpose of your firearm is to get you and your loved ones to safety."\nOne of those ways is ''Neutralizing the threat'', only the person wearing those shoes can make that judgement on the best course of action.[/u]\n\n[b]Concluding my thoughts[/b]on Points (of Abbas bro''s post) 1 , 2 and 3 ,they have no bearing on the Chambered round or an empty chambered handgun, they are simply matter''s of training and mindset of the individual. \nPlease get some training, Buy a training video if you can''t afford to take classes outside of Pakistan, and then practice what you hv seen/learnt.', 1, 0, '182.177.201.199', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Xplor Unico has some really good improvements technologically like RECOIL SPRING CHANGED POSITION, STEELIUM MATERIAL BARREL, ROTATING LOCKING BOLT, BETTER MAGAZINE CAP, BETTER WEIGHT (1/4 LBS LESS), KickOff3 RECOIL & MECHANICAL STRESS DAMPER.\r\n\r\nI especially like the new feature (i.e. relocation of recoil spring) which doesn''t let dirt etc accummulate in the stock-receiver junction like previous models in which you have to take the gun after every 500-1000 rounds or so to gunsmith and get the recoil spring out from stock and get it cleaned to avoid jamming and to maintain a fluid, crisp, low recoil ejection. Secondly the KO3 recoil damper is a v good feature in Xplor. I think there are advantages with this new innovation rather than downside.

[B]A Chambered round is not dangerous and you can become experts by reading. [/B]\n\n;)\n\nI really don''t have much to say about the above, my usage of the words "Arm Chair Experts" does make some brothers wince but rest assured it is not directed at anyone personally. My definition of an ArmChair Expert is someone who instead of going out and getting some real life experience sits on the internet, reads a dozen forums and websites and forms an opinion based on what other people are saying. I once received a lengthy talk on self defence shooting and I was impressed enough to ask the brother how many rounds had he shot perfecting his skill and the reply was zero, he had never shot a gun in his life. This is your stereotypical ArmChair expert, all talk and no experience and no substance. It''s the same as having read a book on driving or playing a flight simulator and thinking they are fit to drive or fly.[/quote] \n\nLet me just state something that was written in Oxford handbook of clinical medicine  and I''m paraphrasing : If your nurse , OTA ( operation theatre assistant) has some opinion about something, Always Listen to what they hv to say, Assess the new information, and they  proceed accordingly. \nThe point is simple, New information is knowledge, and it can''t hurt to get it where ever and how ever it comes to you.\nArmchair experts are driven by '' the best information'' gather it from around the interweb, and present it , I can appreciate that, and trolls are just trolls , sometimes the armchair experts can become a little rigid and appear trollish , but that is a separate thing.\n\nHowever the next logical step of this armchair debate vis-a-vis self defence will be (what I encountered with a cousin of mine)[b] who made you the expert , have you ever been in a gun battle?[/b] so this Armchair thing doesn''t stop.\nInformation is pertinent to everything.Defensive firearm training is Different from firing thousands of rounds down range trying to hit bulls eye at 25 meters.You said that yourself. Simply dismissing people because they lack credentials in your opinion is again a bit harsh, you hv a brain , what seems logical to you , use it and apply it in your life, if it works , adopt it, otherwise dump it like a bad habit.\n \nRegarding the chambered Firearm : I have not been in a gun fight, and IA I hope I never will have to , But I was lucky enough to take an introductory Firearm training class in the US. [b] People that Train people in defensive Firearms and have experience, Insist that carrying Chambered is EFFICIENT [/b] [u]A modern Chambered handgun is Functionally Inert. Know the Four rules , practice and follow them religiously, and carry in a  ready state.[/u]\nI know of no Popular or unpopular Commercial firearm instructor that tells students to keep their Carry weapons empty chambered.( these people don''t count as armchair experts)       \n\n[quote]5). [B]Racking the Slide takes too long. [/B]If you cannot spare a quarter of a second to rack the slide then you should''t be shooting at something in the first place. Where do you think your bullet is going to land if you plan to dedicate 1/4 of a second to target acquisition ? Please try something practical, draw your gun to shoot from your conceal carry position a couple of times, time yourself when you''re racking the slide to first shot vs putting the safety on fire to first shot. Done right and without bias, it will be the same. [/quote]\n\n[b]Since you brought up the body alarm reaction in a previous post : the sympathetic system ( Fright, flight , fight system ) That same system also causes sweating, what if your injured ( one handed racking) or bloody with all those variable things that could happen, do you really want to add racking a slide to the equation? With slippery hands( atleast), bloody hands or just one hand in worst case scenario?[/b] \nThe point simply for carrying chambered is to simplify things( while still being effectively as safe as modern un-chambered firearm) for when shit hits the fan. That''s the same reason why I hate leather /nylon holsters with clips/buttons, whole Covers and Valcro for retention. The more complex things get the less likely it gets to repeat them under stress.\nAlso the action of racking probably doesn''t take that much more time ( it takes time, it simple isn''t the same), but add getting to the slide, racking, reacquiring the grip after that excessive movement and punching out to target , that whole process adds up. It takes time. \nIf you hv an apple isomething , get "shot timer" its free, and test yourself , whatever way you practice, get things down to 2 sec''s or less from draw to presentation to Click ( dry fire only at first ) . I''m pretty sure android has one too.  \n\n[quote] 6). [B]I have the Safety on, so it''s safe[/B] Any manufactured item comes with a warranty which after a certain time runs out. The warranty itself means if this product fails to perform in the desired manner within x time frame we will repair/replace it. Everything ''can'' fail, (which is why warranty''s exist) I would just rather not trust my life to a piece of metal. If your firearm malfunctions that means your warranty has run out. ;)\n\nThere are quite a few friends who like to carry ''one in the pipe''. It''s fine by me, my job is to recommend something which minimizes the risk a firearm poses to them, their loved ones & the unfortunate passer-by. [B]Please don''t let Paranoia overshadow responsibility[/B]. \n[/QUOTE]\n\nhere comes another car analogy : On reversible lanes ( traffic goin both ways ) how concerned are people of the incoming vehicle having an incapacitated driver, brakes failing, axle breaking etc etc. Statistically we are all much much much more likely to get into a road accident then ever get shot. So how come Most Pakistanis insist on not wearing seat-belts or helmets ?\nHow come some people that carry guns smoke, You are insanely more likely to die of the cigarette than a bullet, and mind you it wont be quick and easy either. \nMy point is simple : Mechanical failures on Well maintained Modern equipment Are Freak event''s, they simply don''t happen to warrant overly cautious approach.\nIn my Opinion : A Broken Firearm is Dangerous. Period.  it has nothing to do with a Chambered Round , or an un-chambered round \nmost polymer and metal of the Firearm with out live the user twice over.\n\nRegarding the " I hv a safety, its safe " Again Sir thats where the Four laws come in.\n[b] Safe handling, and learning to safely handle a Firearm is not mutually exclusive to ''making'' firearms Safe [/b]\nbad habits are born out of this callous approach of I am carrying un-chambered so , I can fiddle with  the trigger all I want, in fact I can play with it, point it at my friends nut''s, Check the barrel from the muzzle end ( I''ve seem or heard of these things )[/quote]', 1, 0, '94.205.80.193', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

After achieving Optical center, your gun will hit about 5 inches low at 25 yards\n5. Now you will need a drooper mount or adjustable one piece lockdown mount\n6. Keep the stock screws properly tight (not over tight)\n7. Without touching the optical centre, your gun should hit the target at the most 1.5 inches away from the point of aim\n8. For that much adjustment you should use the scope''s horizental and vertical adjustments.\n9. Zero your gun at 30 yards\n10. What is the parallax of your scope?\n11.

After repetitive usage with mouse loads (such as 24g), they would malfunction & get damaged. The gun has to be RATED for certain loads you use. Both these have a SELF ADJUSTING gas mechanism though, 1oz loads and up for Maxus, and 1-1/8 oz loads and up for SX3.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, I would rate A303 as the best Beretta semi auto for hunting, better than any Browning or Benelli or Beretta, even though it does not have a self adjusting mech (it is made for only 1 oz to 1-1/8 oz loads) & neither 3" magnum capability. The Beretta AL390 is the most preferred gas semiauto in Argentina high volume shooting, not even AL391 or Xplor, due to lesser plastics in that model like A303. ''Lesser plastics'' means lesser technopolymers. \r\n\r\nThese are personal choices when it comes down to choosing Maxus or Urika etc etc. But, technologically, Xplor UNICO does have certain technological innovations. Shooting comfort, ease of swing and handling in field ... is another issue ... and a very subjective one.\r\n\r\nXPLOR UNICO TECH ADVANTAGES WHICH CAN''T BE IGNORED:\r\n\r\n- Rotating bolt (locking type) does NOT let gases escape and hence all gas pressure is used inside mechanism to move bolt etc, hence higher bolt speed which is then helpful to drive mouse loads i.e. all load cycling ability. This is also the reason for BLINK system i.e. fastest cycling and bolt speed in any Beretta semiauto.\r\n- The KickOff is a pretty expensive accessory...installing it on any other Beretta would make it infeasible product Vs price pt of view. Besides how will you achieve the ideal 14.25" stock length when installing KO in Urika 2 for example?KO does tame MUZZLE FLIP when firing repeatedly at covies (upland) or flocks (waterfowl)...is helpful when firing 36 grams Shaheen Super or other high velocity loads. Even normal 31 gms loads by Shaheen seem like firing an airgun. KickOff mitigates recoil by 60% as claimed by Beretta and KickOff3 lessens recoil by a further 10%  \r\nbesides absorbing mechanical stress (KO3). That point about KO3 is very important for me .... mitigating and absorbing mech stress on bolt and internal parts as well as receiver .... saves the receiver from peening. Thus LONGTERM LIFE of the firearm is enhanced.\r\n- Lastly and v importantly, the RECOIL SPRING has been relocated which does NOT let dirt etc accumulate in the stock  recoil spring like previous models (AL391,A303,A304 etc) and the gun becomes lesser prone to jamming.\r\n- Another important feature is use of material STEELIUM in barrel. Steelium is also being used now in some army high  firing weapons by experts here in pakistan. Reason: it is a much tougher, much durable and better material for firearm  metallurgy and also expensive.\r\n- Mag cap is jam proof in Xplor whereas I have had my Teknys mag cap jam after hunting few times. You have to oil it  repeatedly to avoid jamming issues.\r\n\r\nDespite all these technical advantages or innovations, still one cannot say that Xplor Unico would be the most preferred hunting firearm by certain individual because as said, hunting firearms are very INDIVIDUAL choices. My top choice is A303, yours Maxus Hunter. But still, tons of Xplor Unicos are rolling successfully in market here in Pakistan with very good field results. A close friend who has been using Teknys Optima for years just bought Xplor Unico with KO and is  \r\nimmensely happy with the results in the few quail openers.\r\n\r\nI dont think Maxus beats Xplor BLINK technology in speed of cycling. I have not had great reviews about Maxus from guys who have used it in field. But as I said, these hunting firearms are individual choices. A Beretta never fails you in  \r\nfield ... & the patterns are just SUPERB ... thats what I have experienced since many years.', 1, 1, '110.36.199.128', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I  admit it''s easy to get quite passionate when putting forth our  respective views during a heated debate, but as I had mentioned in the  disclaimer of my first post, feel free to express your points of view  but kindly do so in a civil manner. Thanks! :)\n\n@Abbas\nI do agree completely with the [B]intention[/B]  behind all the points you put forward, however I feel as if your  arguments based less on the inherent "flaws" of human beings and more to  do with a general lack of respect for a firearm. Although I completely  agree that an unfortunate majority of gun owners here in Pakistan are  uneducated to the discipline of gun safety, I think it''s in general unfair  to categorize [B]all[/B] gun owners as irresponsible. For example, just because somebody carries a chambered firearm for self-defense does [B]NOT [/B]mean  that he/she is a hothead prone to shooting at a whim, nor does it fill  the the operator''s head with grandiose visions of being the next version  of Chuck Norris!

Gun folks always say "Guns dont kill people, its people who kill people". That sentence could not have been more correct. I would consider myself as people, and human error is 99% of gun related deaths. I would never feel comfortable vouching for another human being''s mental state or the equipment he carries, and not vouching means immediate family members who carry weapons as well. There was another gentleman on this forum who posted his unforeseen firearm discharge within his house. I do not think I would have the courage to face my children as their primary threat even in an accident. What I would do is condition myself to be better in a state on diminished preparedness. Practice makes perfect. \n\nWell I also have to be honest with you, I dont roam around the whole city unnecessarily but I also do not live within my walls either. I do travel to a lot of shady areas like Katti Pahari and Mangho Peer (marble shopping), but I stay within safe limits with my weapon unchambered or chambered according to the threat level I can ascertain. The rest is practically out of my hands, I have drawn successfully before and God willing I will do it again. But on a personal level we need to find out the cause of such paranoia by some members. If you are not in the armed services or at war with someone, then I find this heightened sense of people coming to steal your money is to be more like flies getting a whiff of the honey. If you would rather have an ego problem to roam around in super flashy cars and make a banner out of your iphone, rolex and your armani glasses, no amount of weapons and guards will save you from the inevitable. You shooting down a BG will only make the rest or others prepare better next time. Killing a BG is practically like signing your death warrant in this country. This should be explained to people who live in two sides of the world.

He had a lot of questions about airguns, which by the grace of God were answered to his complete satisfaction.\n\nI too think that we should leave this topic now and let the shipment reach.\n\nI wonder why most people are interested in this topic while I have also initiateed some equally important posts relating to Tuning of Airguns and replacing of springs and pistons.\n\nI have also offered free of cost help in this respect to help the young airgunners in our country.\n\nGood pellets are very important but well tuned gun is not less important.\n\nThanks dear for taking time to bring facts to this forum.\n\nRegards', 1, 0, '119.154.218.68', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If you see Benelli site, semi autos clearly state 70mm shell and 32grams loads as minimum requirement. 32g up to 56g or super magnum cartrgs like 64g are no problem for most high end semis by Benelli. But on the lower end, there is certainly a cap on which grams cartrg the gun will reliably cycle. The shaheen regular is neither actually 31g as claimed nor exactly 70mm in length (if I am not wrong). At least the earlier loads had that problem. Even last year a friend tested the grams in regular 31g Shaheen #8 and #6 - it was around 28g-29g on scale. Therefore we see problems with regular Shaheen cartrg in almost all Benellis. THIS IS EXACTLY THE BEAUTY OF A BERETTA SEMI AUTO (that I was talking about - never fails in field - whatever the load or cartrg length or grams - grams ALL-LOAD flexibilty with only model 390 and later ones).\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand, certain good inertia guns, like Franchi Raptor, state they can reliably cycle 24g-56g loads, then they will. We just have to confirm from manuals and gun tech dept of that company via phone/email.

Its an Italian made [B]Marocchi First-E "Deluxe" O/U Shotgun[/B]. This particular model in the lesser known Marocchi lineup is built for upland hunting where a each pound of weight saved matters. This shotgun follows a basic format that can be seen in several other makers from the same Italian gunmaking heartland as Marocchi.\r\n\r\n[B]Some specs:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. Barrel Length = 28 inches, chrome lined\r\n2. Weight = 2.8kg or 6.16lbs\r\n3. Interchange Chokes  = 5\r\n5. Trigger = Single selective mechanical trigger\r\n6. Rib = 6mm straight\r\n7.

The country that makes Ferraris and Ducatis.\r\n\r\nThe wood to metal finish is great. comparable to any quality Italian shotgun. the aluminum receiver is also nicely finished. one is amazed at the quality that this shotgun is offering in its price range.\r\n\r\nas far as engraving is concerned. It represents a minimalist approach with gilded birds.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic04.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThats a safety/barrel selector switch. the safety is non automatic. that means breaking the gun open (or closing it) will not engage it and the user would not be bothered by constantly toggling the safety switch after each shot. the safety and control lever work as expected. nice smooth movement. the control lever did felt a little hard to open but closing the gun back up was absolute pleasure.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic05.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nis this me or everything on this gun just lines up absolutely straight? don''t you love it when that happens?\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic06.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOur member hunter468 (after going a few rounds) inspecting primer strikes.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic07.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nbeautiful and clean checkering. looks like laser work. quiet many shotgun manufacturers are resorting to laser checkering these days as it produces clean and high definition checkering while reducing production costs and time. the forend is also shaped pretty nice. offering a firm grip without stretching the hand in an awkward position.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic08.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\njust look at that checkering. :) I was a little skeptical at first about the black trigger guard but it totally goes along with the black accented control levers on this shotgun.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic09.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nhmm.... somebody is having fun at the trap range. ;)\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic10.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nstrong and authoritative ejection. the hulls are thrown quiet a distance away. the ejectors cannot be turned into manual extractors.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Marocchi%20First%20E%20Deluxe/Pic11.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI loved the mechanical trigger on this one as I couldn''t tell any difference in the trigger pull between the first and second barrel.

I always wanted PakGuns to showcase that Pakistani''s are cultured and lately these threads are derailing the whole impression. Regardless of what is happening in our country, I don''t want to highlight what goes on (negatively) in my home to the entire world. \n\nI''m bardashting this "Curse of the Chambered Round" thread with a heavy heart keeping the right of everyone to voice their opinion otherwise this thread is encouraging people to sheer stupidity.

Someone is going to end up shooting himself by reading his point of views.\n\nThe whole Omkhan incident and the Ahnab Incident were prime examples of insanity I''m talking about. I was going to tear OmKhan (btw he''s a hardcore SA/Hamza cheerleader) a new one back then as well when his thread started but the guy was injured and almost mortally wounded so I kept my peace.. in Ahnab''s pulling a gun out incident Skeeter sahib jumped in cowboy style and encouraged him on his extremely foolish and completely idiotic behaviour (pulling a loaded gun out on the main road and pointing it at a kids face)..  I again kept quiet out of respect for Skeeter shahib but we seriously need to discourage this kind of behaviour on our forums. This is foolishness !

I would rather chamber the round in a controlled environment so that I can double check that the round has chambered properly rather than trust myself and my gun in a shtf moment. What if a malfunction were to happen while you were, under the stress of about to lose your life, trying to get a round chambered within the time frame of a couple of seconds? \r\n2. Most firearm malfunctions occur during the process of cycling of the gun ( from failure to seed to double feeds) adding the manual racking May increase the chances of the gun failing to work when your life depended upon it.\r\n3. What if one of your hands/arms was restrained in some way and you have to draw/rack/fire with one hand? You might be carrying/holding your child, your arm might be injured. Have you trained racking a slide while wearing shalwar Kameez.   Since the premise here in previous posts has been most firearm owners are not proficient enough, racking a slide is un-necessary complexity.   \r\n4. In a modern handgun, keep your dang booger picker out of the trigger guard (and everything else out of the trigger guard) and the gun will not go off ( that is how they are designed), unless it is broke , then you need to get it fixed anyway.\r\n5. You may not have enough time or stealth to be able to rack a semi-auto in the event you need to use it. Adrenaline( in a stressful condition) as pointed out by Abbas bro in a previous post Makes your hands sweaty and slippery, add to that the warm weather in Pakistan in general. \r\nIf a certain method is more likely to cause failure ( both mechanical and human) Under stress and in a wide variety of scenario''s, then there might be need to change it or modify it.\r\nMaybe these points seem like childish rants to some or arguments for the sake of arguments. However Most of these are reasons for carrying chambered as advised by All modern firearm instructors ( you are free to follow or ignore their opinion) , most LEA agencies and Military units including the Israeli''s, and sadly by most bad guys too.\r\nThey Key to everything is Train and Practice, practice, practice ( dry firing does not cost extra ).', 1, 0, '199.58.84.7', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Welcome back. \n\nI''m going to say a few things beyond Ahnab''s initial carry a round in the chamber debate. I deem all PakGuns members like brothers hence advise them to the best of my ability.\n\nThe point I was simply trying to make is, experience or skill has nothing to do with bad luck. No one can be alert or ''on duty'' 24/7, it can happen to anyone. I am just suggesting to give the bad luck a 5 % chance to happen rather than 100%. I myself carry chambered but only when I think I might require my firearm. \n\nWith due respect to the brothers above, I certainly don''t agree with pulling a firearm out in the middle of a road and pointing it at a kids face for a traffic accident nor trying to out shoot a chambered / pointed gun. In my opinion both brothers were by the Grace of God [B]insanely lucky[/B] (may Allah (swt) always keep them and their families safe). \n\nIn the first case Omkhan almost died, in the second scenario Ahnab might have had to pull the trigger and spend the rest of his life in jail for manslaughter. Point I am making is, there is a time to pull out your firearm, a traffic accident in my humble opinion is not one of them. If Ahnab God forbid had to pull the trigger he would have prayed for the time when he had the opportunity to sell everything he owned to have paid for repairs for the other guy''s car instead even though it was completely the other guys fault. The ensuing problems he and his family would have faced would not have been worth anything he owned. \n\nA firearm enthusiast needs to be a more humble and forgiving human being than his peers. The power to kill should also be accompanied by an increased sense of humanity and ''when'' to act otherwise one is thinking like a criminal.\n\nWe are not from LEA''s, we''re civilians. My approach towards firearms and when to pull out a gun surprises many people as they expect that I should be the flag bearer for machismo which comes with firearms but unfortunately even at my relatively young age I''ve had more experiences and incidents than most people have in a life time. I just prefer not to share them and put it behind me. What I prefer to do however is to recommend to others what I have learnt after going though a couple of scenarios. \n\nSuffice it to say I did not drive a B6 level Mercedes for 12 years of my life without need ;)', 1, 0, '94.205.80.193', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The decision was made by all to call it a day and to leave back for DG Khan.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]We all started our journey back in four vehicles. When we reached Khar after crossing Rakni and Fort Monroe at about 12:30 pm, we were told by the locals that due to land slide the whole road at Fort Monroe has been washed away. I was of the opinion that we should proceed to the washed away road and cross it by foot; our vehicles can be left at Khar and we will hire other transportation means on the other side of the land slide. However, the rest of the party decided that we should adopt the road back to Baikar and then onwards to Marri and Rajanpur and then further to DG Khan. Now the challenges at hand were (1) no cell reception, (2) roads may have been washed away (3) threats of attacks by outlaws in that area (4) Not enough food or water. We left Khar at about 1:00 pm and reached Baikar at 6:30pm. It was a perfidious journey and I won’t be able to do justice to its treacherousness by just explaining it in simple words. lol. We got stuck at several places where the muddy road was as narrow as 15 feet wide with sliding rocks on one side and a steep drop of almost 300 feet on the other side. Our vehicles were slipping and skidding all over the place. The Jeep Cherokee was a blessing in disguise as we used it as a Tractor to retrieve the other three stuck vehicles from the mud.

In the morning (Monday Sept 10, 2012) the discussion erupted again as to which route to adopt to get out of that area. The option of Marri-Rajanpur-DG Khan was out of the question as the latest intel stated that the flash floods were flowing through a ravine which was very deep and our vehicles could not cross it. Now the other three options were as following:[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000]1. Baikar – Rakni – Loralai – Zhob – DI Khan – Kohat- Peshawar/Islamabad[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000]2. Baikar – Rakni – Zhob -- Danasar – DI Khan – Kohat- Peshawar/Islamabad[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000]3. Baikar – Rakni – Kashmor – DG Khan[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000]Now the question remained which route to adopt as all three of them were very long and we could not afford to lose any more time and there were possibilities of road blocks and flash flooded ravines on all these routes. We were without cell reception so we left Baikar at 10:30am and in about one hour we reached an elevated spot where Warid-The-Great got us through with our families and other sources who could let us know the status of the vehicular commute on these routes.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]From our sources (which included my father’s old pals in Zhob & also the PA of IGFC Balochistan) we received very mixed information about these routes as some said that the roads were blocked and others stated that only 4x4 vehicles could pass through and that too very difficultly. Once we reached Khar after crossing Rakni, I again presented my idea of crossing the land slide portion on foot. In a very reluctant manner, my idea was accepted and we proceeded towards the spot where the mountain had collapsed at Fort Monroe road. I have to say that the scene at the land slide was truly horrifying. There was a 500 meters portion of the road which was completely swept down 400 feet from the spot where we were standing. There were 3 fully loaded cargo trucks which had also been swept down to the bottom of the ravine and interestingly they were on their fours J and were completely intact. We were told that the land slide started very slowly, the crew jumped out of the vehicles saving their lives, however, the trucks slid-down with the earth and reached the bottom, intact J. (That would have been something interesting to see).[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]Now at this stage all of us had our backpacks and other stuff including the shotguns, pistols and the ammunition. J. The fun part was that we were supposed to take along all this stuff; however we left behind the shotgun rounds in the vehicles. The plan was that the vehicles would reach DG Khan if the road is repaired soon (which I doubted because in my opinion the repair would take at least two weeks) and the other option was to adopt any of the above mentioned routes if they are cleared earlier. We started our descent down the ravine with our backpacks and weapons and were able to cross that portion in almost an hour. (If I were able to share the videos, you would have noticed that a man was taking his motorbike down the rocky cliff, which was truly a marvelous feat J.) We walked through the slippery rocks, muddy tracks, thorny bushes, a stream and then in the end, a gradual ascent. Well, it was tough but one heck of fun-time. lol[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]On the other end of the land slide, we boarded a van and started off for DG Khan. When we neared DG Khan, we were told that the floods have entered the city and the only way in to the city is through the Airport road- Chotti and onwards to Rajanpur road. So the journey which was supposed to take 15 minutes from that point onwards, took almost 1.5 hours. By the grace of almighty Allah, we reached DG Khan at 11:30pm. In the morning, Tuesday Sept 11, 2012, we saw the flood water in the city area.

It was fun.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012875.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012876.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]Crony Results:[/B] (to simplify, only Gamo Pro Magnum Results will be listed)\r\n\r\n1. Gamo Shadow 1000: 670 fps\r\n2. Diana 45: 645 fps\r\n3. Hatsan Mod 125: 900 fps\r\n\r\nif you look at the numbers alone, both Hatsan and Gamo gave outstanding performance. however power alone isn''t everything as I found out later when we proceeded towards accuracy comparison.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012860.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nhere is our specially designed target for airguns with back stop (courtesy of Raja Yasir Sb.). setting up took less than a minute. it was fairly windy day as evident by the swinging trees in the background.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012859.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA measuring tape confirmed our distance to target which we decided should be 40 yards.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012865.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nYasir sb. struggling to see the target the cheapo (counterfeit) Gamo scope.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012870.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRaja Yasir sb installing a quality scope on Hatsan that he brought along.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012871.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nthe scope took like forever to zero. the biggest limiting factor was the airgun''s inherent inaccuracy.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012874.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012876.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nYasir sb putting the Gamo through its paces.', 1, 1, '39.47.82.211', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I guess the manufacturer blindly pursued power in this air rifle instead of accuracy. the rifle is heavy, ill balanced and poorly finished. metal work looked more like Darra made than Turkey made. bluing on the barrel was less than satisfactory as well. The trigger was good for a budget oriented airgun. the first thing that ones notices is the recoil on this thing. it practically jumps all over the place once the trigger is pressed. I would say, I wasn''t a bit impressed by this air gun. what looks like a nicely grained wooden furniture is in fact, plastic.\r\n\r\n[B]Gamo Shadow-1000:[/B] way better finished than its Turkish counterpart. each and every control/action was way more refined (from cocking effort to the trigger and safety). power was adequate and it easily competed with a gun that probably costs twice as much. infact, the airgun was equipped with a cheap Gamo (clone) scope. Raja Sb was of the view that this gun''s performance will significantly improve using a quality scope with much clearer view/reticle. I guess in its price range, there is just no comparison between Gamo and Hatsan. Gamo is a much better airgun any day of the week and twice on Sundays.\r\n\r\n[B]Diana 45:[/B] way better gun. a quick look easily reveals what makes a diana a diana. higher finish, refined controls/actions, sweet trigger.\r\n\r\n[B]Final Thoughts:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Airguns/30092012884.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nif you are on a tight budget and want a decent airgun with adequate power and accuracy then go for Gamo Shadow 1000. in its price range, its pretty hard to beat. more power than Diana 45, weighs less and offers comparable accuracy.\r\n\r\nif sheer power is your thing and you are willing to miss even the broad side of a barn for that then by all means get your self a Hatsan. in power department atleast it will not disappoint.\r\n\r\nif you want an airgun that you can probably pass on to your next generation then get a Diana. in simple words, buy a diana and expect nothing but the best.\r\n\r\n[B]Winner: (in terms of Best Bang for Buck)[/B]\r\n\r\nall three of us agreed that Gamo Shadow 1000 represents the best bang for buck in its price range.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\np.s.
