He showed me one.. wont sell it for a paisa less then 36k. Only this Winamax had no manual safety and when I pointed out the legend etched on the frame “Pak made Mouser” he told me the same thing. That the importers had asked the Chinese to put the “made in Pakistan” label to promote Pakistani Products\r\n\r\n (Sigh) I had to squeeze back tears at the sheer love these people had for Pakistan… Imagine taking high quality imports and trying to sell em as DA knock offs..

And as such, the gun (and especially the trigger) requires a break in period of almost 300-350 rounds. The break in especially required in order to smooth out the trigger bar channel and the firing-pin block cylinder. My own Piranha''s trigger has become [B]much[/B] crisper after her break in.\n\n2) Agreed. The sights are, at best, simple "glow in the dark". They''re more suited for low-light conditions and are, in all honesty, absolutely useless in complete darkness.\n\n3) This is [B]VERY[/B] surprising to read. I''ve closely seen both the Scorpion and the Viking, and the Piranha''s finish is [B]infinitely[/B] better; the slide fit is perfect (the Scorpion, on the other hand, rattles if shaken), there are no burrs or factory marks (unlike the Viking which sports them like a slew of tattoos). Actually, as far as finish goes, my only complaint with the Piranha would be the "paint job"; wish it was more sturdy and "scratch proof", so to speak.\n\n4) This, I guess, is as much a functional feature as a preference. The Piranha, as I mentioned earlier, is a clone of the CZ75B. And the CZ75B is considered as one of the most accurate combat pistols in the world because it''s [B]not[/B] nose-heavy. First, by having the center-of-gravity of the gun at the grips, the operator is able to acquire/reacquire a target more quickly and is able to hold a straight line of aim at the target more easily. Second, shifting aim and general manipulation is easier if the weight of the gun is centered at the grip (where the operator''s hands are). The only downside is that the gun has more comparative muzzle-flip than a gun that''s nose-heavy.', 1, 1, '111.68.105.254', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Its pretty accurate, has a steel frame so it''ll last you a lifetime. It comes with 3 mags(mostly anyways, depending on your dealer). \r\n\r\nThe disadvantages are all related to HD/SD i guess. First there''s trigger, very light and has no firing pin block. The other thing that I do not like about it is the fiber optic front sight. For these reasons I would go for an SP-01 or the SP-01 Tactical, which I guess aren''t that readily available as the Shadow and the Phantom(I think there''s a member who owns a plain SP-01, and Denovo Sir owns a Phantom).

They have channels to allow water to go through when the striker moves forward to strike the primer of the bullet. If water is not allowed to go through without resistance, the striker will move slower and could result in a light strike on the primer, and there could be a misfire.\n\nSo, with the maritime spring cups you have a better chance of shooting reliably under water. One thing to be careful about, water is much denser than air of course, so the sound of the shot is very loud (denser medium, less attenuation of sound amplitude at the same distance). Do NOT submerge your head while shooting underwater, unless you have hearing protection. You could damage your hearing with just a couple of shots.\n\nDue to the water being denser than air, the bullet will not go very far. I don''t know the exact range, but I have seen people do videos on youtube and the bullet did not even travel the full length of the swimming pool where they were doing this experiment.\n\nApologies for resurrecting an old thread, but being a new member I really really wanted to post and discuss something :D', 1, 1, '101.50.89.17', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Some are thinking even russian guns are better. I own Perazzi, Beretta and browning. Also turkish made huglu. Now thinking to buy Akus made webley trap gun. I can say Turkish made guns are even better than cheap series Beretta 686 guns. Akus makes 7 pin side by sides. Which are better than 471 series berettas. Brand of Beretta can let you feel happy but Just consider joints quality, wood quality, workmanship. Good quality Turkish guns are far better than baikals. I havent seen a wood grade 5 baikal... I dont know Pakistans tax rates but since we import from Pakistan without custom tax it should be same for Turkish products to Pakistan.

It is fired in converted S&W K-22 revolvers. It is based on the K-Hornet wildcat cartridge, but there is also a 224 Kay-Chuk Jr., which is the standard 22 Hornet case trimmed back slightly. This cartridge is noted as being the inspiration for the Remington 22 Jet cartridge.\n\nThe idea of a high-velocity 22 handgun appealed to no small number of handgun hunters. What they wanted was light recoil combined with flat trajectory. The 224 Kay-Chuk accomplished this better than any previous handgun cartridge and, in fact, is superior to the actual velocity developed by the S&W 22 Jet revolver. A light 37-grain bullet designed by the late Kent Bellah, a noted writer and firearms authority, is usually used with 11 grains of powder #2400 producing a muzzle velocity of 1903 fps and muzzle energy of 308 fpe. He did much to introduce the Harvey-designed zinc base half-jacketed revolver bullets. The 224 Kay-Chuk is one of the most effective small game and varmint cartridge available for the handgun. Unfortunately, it''s a wildcat, hence not available on an over-the-counter, commercial basis. It has a straight body and sharp shoulder, unlike the long taper of the 22 Jet.

The PT92/99 is another good option, but even though I own a Beretta 92, I think the Browning Lock Breach principle is more robust than the Beretta''s (or should I say Walther P-38''s) locking lug.\r\n\r\nThe CZ-999 is a very good handgun, but it is not an exact copy of the 226. I think it is one of the best budget options in Pakistan, but I would still rate the CZ 75B higher because its all steel(but since your friend wants it for HD so it should not be an issue). As far as carrying goes, its still the best option due to its slim profile. \r\n\r\nWith all respect to other opinions, I think the CZ 75B is the best of all the CZ''s, simply because its what made them famous, and all the rest are based on it. Another thing, if you all look at the CZ usa site, you''ll notice that they have reduced the frame length of the Shadow. This actually proves that frame length has nothing to do with accuracy. The Shadow is accurate simply because it does not have the firing pin safety hence a better trigger, but that makes it a range gun. If one wishes to go for a range gun, then he can chose between the Shadow or the CZ 85 Combat.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.185.69.204', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(275675, 9128, 275147, 'PakistanFirst', 5092, '', 1340427407, 'A friend of mine tuned his 34 with non-factory spring and non-factory guide. He told me that he shot his 34 only a few times when he decided to redo his rifle. He is sending me the original parts he took out his rifle that I will use in my 34P.\n \nWhen I took the piston out of the chamber of my 34P, I found the internals bone-dry. I cleaned all parts. I closely examined the spring, guide and the seal. I found the spring bent in several places. The guide was loose within the spring. I examined the seal with a magnifying glass. It appeared to be in excellent condition. All the same, I will replace the seal also.\n \nA word of caution - the cocking slot and the slot in the piston have sharp edges. You may also find sharp edges if you have a metal spring guide. Remove these sharp edges with a small file.\n \nThere is debate about honing or not honing the cylinder. I opted to hone mine. I have a brake cylinder hone that has been with me for 40 or more years. I replaced the old stones with new 400 grit stones. The brake hone has adjustment for tension. Due to the design of this type of hone it can only be rotated past the cocking slot. Since the original stem of the hone is short, I used a rubber tubing to make an extension to reach the deep end of the cylinder.\n \nEven 400 grit is very abrasive when used dry. I read and followed the hint of another airgunner who immersed the cocking tube in big bucket of water and used an electric drill to rotate the hone with a back-and-forth motion for a cross-hash pattern. Such a pattern retains lubricants on the wall of the bore in which the piston travels. For this reason it is advisable not to have a mirror finish in the cylinder. If you plan to use a brake cylinder hone, pay attention and do not rotate the hone to a point where it may get stuck in the cocking slot and damage the gun and even injure you.\n \nIf you do not have a brake cylinder hone, you can use a wood dowel on which you wrap wet-dry emery cloth and do the honing by hand. You can use a PVC pipe with cut along the its length to hold the emery cloth. It is advisable to use water or some other agent for a finer finish in the bore. Make sure the cocking tube is thoroughly cleaned to remove any abrasive particles that may be in the bore.\n \nEssential lubricant for tuning is moly paste (molybdenum disulfide).  An air rifle attains very temperatures when it is fired. You may have seen someone’s air rifle “smoking” after being fired.  This “smoking” effect is called  “dieseling”. It can ruin an airgun. Any ordinary grease or oil in the chamber when compressed in airgun will ignite just like the mechanism as in a diesel engine - combustion by means of compressions.  Do not use any regular automotive grease in the compression chamber.\n \nI got my 60% paste from a Honda dealer. It is rated for temperature up to 400 degrees celcius for moving parts and 815 degrees for non-moving parts. Do not use any paste that is rated lower than 50%.  Use very thin coating of this paste around the edges of the seal, front bearing surface of the piston and the skirt portion of the piston. Wrap a paper towel on a dowel and apply very thin layer of moly paste on it. Now lubricate the piston tube with the dowel. Very carefully guide the piston in the cylinder so as not o cut or damage the seal. Use moly paste to lubricate any metal-to-metal contacts - the pivot bolt and the bolt washers come to mind.\n  \nI calculated the spring length (4.428 inches) when fully compressed. I did this by counting the number of turns in the spring and the thickness of the wire of the spring. I measured the available space inside the piston  (4.438 inches). I subtracted the compressed spring thickness from the available piston space. This gave me remaining space of (4.438-4.24) of 0.158 inch. I subtracted the thickness of the spring guide thrust washer (0.026 inch) from 0.158 with a balance of 0.132 inch space in the piston. My 34P did not have thrust washer in front of the spring. By adding a thrust washer in front of the spring I had remaining space (0.132-0.026) of 0.106 inch. This is sufficient space in the piston to cock the trigger.\n \nExamine the ends of the springs. If they are not smooth, bring them to a polish. I use my knife sharpening stone for this process. Stick a screwdriver near each end of the spring and remove any sharp inner ends. Polished spring ends help to lessen vibrations.\n\nAt times you may hear airgun making a “twang” sound. This noise comes about when the expanding spring hits the wall of piston. To dampen this noise use very viscous grease around outer edges of the spring. You can use NLGI (National Lubricating Grease Institute) Grade 4 grease. This grease is similar to the viscosity of the tar used in building roads. At times this grade of grease in our airgunning hobby is called “spring tar” as it is used on airgun springs.\n \nI will not touch the trigger assembly as I find the “feel” ok.\n  \nI hope the above is of some help.', 1, 1, '75.140.20.253', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0);

My first introduction to a tuned gun was an FAC rated HW80 tuned by a famous UK based tuner.This gun felt like a Jaguar XJ8 - smooth, powerful and quiet. It was a 0.177 cal gun and worked best with H&N Barracudas. \n\nFrom what little I have seen in Pakistan. I will not ever let any local "mistri" touch one of my guns. Cleanliness and professionalism are treated like diseases by these knaves, and I have seen many a good gun being spoilt by them. Including a few of my own.  \n\nA few years ago, I got a spring, spring guide and tar from James Maccari, and it was worth every dollar that I paid for it. \n\nOn a slightly unrelated note, or perhaps remotely related, I read, not too long ago, on an online forum, that airguns with leather seals, especially Chinese airguns benefit from a few cc of Slick 50 in the compression chamber. The trick is to first thoroughly clean the gun bone dry, by using carb cleaner, and leaving it aside for a day, so that by the next morning it is thoroughly dry. Then it should be put out in the sun, (the following day) for a few hours, and then it should be properly lubed (read sparingly, less is more, in this discipline as you may well know), taking care that no oil or lubricants find their way into the compression chamber. Then  using a hypodermic syringe sans the needle, about 1 cc of Slick 50 should be injected into the compression chamber via the transfer port. Next the barrel should be worked up and down about half a dozen times, taking care not to cock the gun. Now another 1.5cc should be injected into the transfer port, and the barrel worked up and down another eight times.  Then let the gun stand in the sun for another half an hour. After which, one may shoot through it some heavy pellets until such time that the gun stops dieseling. This is said to improve the sealing in the chamber, enhance lubrication, enhance seal life and boost compression, and consequently, enhance pellet velocity and energy too. I have yet to try this myself, but I am sorely tempted to get myself a Chinese gun and use it as guinea pig for this experiment and several more.\n\nLast, but not the least, you seem to live in California, so you are in the civilised world, but my advice to every fellow Pakistani who cares for his airgun, is not to let any desi mistri., specially not the dirty crooks in Lucky Star, Karachi, anywhere near there guns.

Main attraction is the footpath stalls they sell everything firearm/tactical gear related from Roni kit to scope mounts to Bianch holsters to weapon light to stun guns so on........  but with a huge doubt in country of origin .\n   \n  Very first shop I went to was a pleasant surprise; while I was trying to communicate with the doorman (all the big stores have type of Badmash at their main door to ask what you are trying to enter in the shop for) a very smart old Sardar Ji came out asking " what are you looking for Sir" I asked him about 11mm high ring mounts so he invited me in to look for.  Sardar Ji asked me that where I was from when I told him Sialkot he suddenly transformed into a pure Sardar Ji saying " Ohh Pah ji main vee Kamoki da waan "  from there on there was no communication gap, I was feeling very much at home. \n  Although I didnot buy anything from that shop but meeting this nice guy was a sheer pleasure, I asked him about the gun keeping laws n regulations which he explained me very nicely. They didnot have what I wanted but have lot of good variety of guns like Glocks to CZ handguns n rifle, Beretta n browning shotguns. I asked him for the photo (of him n shop) but he politely refused so taken only one of shops front.\n  Once again I really feel happy to see a Graeen in Bangkok having good big firearm store & more over its fun watching a Sardar Ji speaking Thai.

Main attraction is the footpath stalls they sell everything firearm/tactical gear related from Roni kit to scope mounts to Bianch holsters to weapon light to stun guns so on........  but with a huge doubt in country of origin .\n   \n  Very first shop I went to was a pleasant surprise; while I was trying to communicate with the doorman (all the big stores have type of Badmash at their main door to ask what you are trying to enter in the shop for) a very smart old Sardar Ji came out asking " what are you looking for Sir" I asked him about 11mm high ring mounts so he invited me in to look for.  Sardar Ji asked me that where I was from when I told him Sialkot he suddenly transformed into a pure Sardar Ji saying " Ohh Pah ji main vee Kamoki da waan "  from there on there was no communication gap, I was feeling very much at home. \n  Although I didnot buy anything from that shop but meeting this nice guy was a sheer pleasure, I asked him about the gun keeping laws n regulations which he explained me very nicely. They didnot have what I wanted but have lot of good variety of guns like Glocks to CZ handguns n rifle, Beretta n browning shotguns. I asked him for the photo (of him n shop) but he politely refused so taken only one of shops front.\n  Once again I really feel happy to see a Graeen in Bangkok having good big firearm store & more over its fun watching a Sardar Ji speaking Thai. He referred me to a shop selling good gun accessories just in the market across the road.\n   \n  I really feel sorry for not asking his name or for his business card, was so happy to see him that forgot all the mannerism :(\n  Photo of Sardar Ji''s store:\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Bangkok n Taipie 06-2012/SardarJisShop.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n   \n  After Sardar Ji went the shop he recommended, it was a good store filled with lot of accessories most which we only see on online shops, wanted to buy dozens of these but had to travel to Taipei next day so restrained to small items. Here I met a very mannered n helpful young guy  who guided me for everything I asked and arranged 11mm high rings from some other place as they didn''t have these.

BUT if it is a HD scenario just kill that bastard if he has entered your home. NO EXCUSE to it, it will almost always become a SD if he is dead. \r\n\r\nIn a SD scenario BEST option will always be .. Take a decisive action without fear.. translate it in urdu.. CHORNA MAT USSKO .. \r\n\r\nThe SD scenario will always have to have a story line as what has happened.. you will have to explain that what were you doing there and what really happened.. WHY was it that you took out your gun and killed that SHARIF insaan..\r\nMany a lawyers these days cross certain limits to save the client after all that is their duty.. (here client means BG).. if he is alive.. BOTH sides will say that the other person is the BG. SO if ONE is dead; all the other has to do is explain his story.. maximum police will take the weapon and ask for you to get a court order.. YOU will CERTAINLY need a lawyer here, this has happened in Karachi but here the story is different from anywhere in Pakistan. LEAVING a BG is seriously dangerous.. more than anything because you will surely be in a fix by the same BG that you shot.\r\nSecondly there are self defense sections in the Pakistan Penal Code. i.e the law the sets the punishments of crimes and defines what event is specific crime and the reasons.. I am copying here the sections relating to self defense.\r\n\r\nIN HD if you kill that trespasser he wont be able to say anything that will be a lie or wont be able to mingle his version of story into the truth that you say.. heck he can even say that "mera iss ki behan/ beti say ishq tha. aur ghar par bulaya baat karnay kay liye aur goli mar dee.. yeh unlicensed pistol bhi unhon nay hee rakha hai." explaining that will surely put you and your family at peril. Any one that trespasses MUST be dealt with swiftly and decisively; it is absolutely legal till this point.. and if you happen to kill his friend/ second adversary outside then drag his body inside so that excessive usage of force is not implied. You may not have a problem with the killing of the person inside.. but the person who did not enter inside yet you killed him would tantamount to a culpable murder meaning life term. The law is like this .. and you have to follow the law no matter it doesnt appeal to your mind or seems illogical.\r\n\r\n[B][U][I]Relevant sections of Pakistan Penal Code:[/I][/U][/B]\r\n\r\n[B]100.

Its good to come across someone who knows what he is doing. My first introduction to a tuned gun was an FAC rated HW80 tuned by a famous UK based tuner.This gun felt like a Jaguar XJ8 - smooth, powerful and quiet. It was a 0.177 cal gun and worked best with H&N Barracudas. \n\nFrom what little I have seen in Pakistan. I will not ever let any local "mistri" touch one of my guns. Cleanliness and professionalism are treated like diseases by these knaves, and I have seen many a good gun being spoilt by them. Including a few of my own.  \n\nA few years ago, I got a spring, spring guide and tar from James Maccari, and it was worth every dollar that I paid for it. \n\nOn a slightly unrelated note, or perhaps remotely related, I read, not too long ago, on an online forum, that airguns with leather seals, especially Chinese airguns benefit from a few cc of Slick 50 in the compression chamber. The trick is to first thoroughly clean the gun bone dry, by using carb cleaner, and leaving it aside for a day, so that by the next morning it is thoroughly dry. Then it should be put out in the sun, (the following day) for a few hours, and then it should be properly lubed (read sparingly, less is more, in this discipline as you may well know), taking care that no oil or lubricants find their way into the compression chamber. Then  using a hypodermic syringe sans the needle, about 1 cc of Slick 50 should be injected into the compression chamber via the transfer port. Next the barrel should be worked up and down about half a dozen times, taking care not to cock the gun. Now another 1.5cc should be injected into the transfer port, and the barrel worked up and down another eight times.  Then let the gun stand in the sun for another half an hour. After which, one may shoot through it some heavy pellets until such time that the gun stops dieseling. This is said to improve the sealing in the chamber, enhance lubrication, enhance seal life and boost compression, and consequently, enhance pellet velocity and energy too. I have yet to try this myself, but I am sorely tempted to get myself a Chinese gun and use it as guinea pig for this experiment and several more.\n\nLast, but not the least, you seem to live in California, so you are in the civilised world, but my advice to every fellow Pakistani who cares for his airgun, is not to let any desi mistri., specially not the dirty crooks in Lucky Star, Karachi, anywhere near there guns.

Certainly, This is a best forum to find such a person to help a PG member who is stuck in such a terrible situation.', 1, 1, '110.38.85.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Since only bolt action rifles are allowed on NPB or alternately .22 in Bolt action or semi auto. Getting a rifle for HD is pointless. Spacialy since in an HD scenario you will have to engage in close quarters. And rifles are for long range shooting. (unless of course you have a house spread over a few dozen acres)\n\nIf you are on a really tight budget then get a local pump along the lines of a KAC (khyber arms company) pump action. Their NIB (New in box) 7 + 1 pumps start at 5k. \n\nA little better and (asthaticaly more appealing) option would be a winchester defender pump clone with wooden furniture and double pump option. The KAC expert around about 9k. I bought it last week incidentaly. \n\nIf you have still more a bigger budget then get a Hatsan MP-A at around 40k Available at guns and accassories zamzama and Pak armoury Burhani centre M.A Jinnah Road.  This weapon has fibre optic front sights, ghoast ring sights, piston for fast cycling and is an excellent clone of the Benali m 4.  The weapon selected by the amarican armed forces. \n\n[url]http://hatsan.com.tr/new_escort_mpa.asp[/url]\n\nIt has 2 accasory rails for halographic/telescopic sights & laser ligght combos. And also slug barrel as well as flash suppreser.\n\nIf U can go up to 65k u can get the Akdal M1919. It looks like an M16 on steriods! Availabe at just bout all dealers\n\nIf u can go upwords to 120k then of course the one an only option Saiga 12 combat shotgun.

It would be  great for starters. It retails around 42k in Karachi.  It has firing pin safety, loaded chamber indicator hammer block safety and sports a control lever that acts both as manual safety as well as decocker and low recoil + plus its light as well.  \n\nThe Stoeger cougher is also a great weapon. It sports the same features and some models are available with accassory rails for lasers and tactical lights. Its slightly heavier but over all better quality and its controls are very easy to a maniupulate unlike the CF whose control lever is usualy very stiff out of the box. \n\nIn this range U can find a number of turkish CZ clone offerings. Excellent guns no doubt, but without a decocker u''l have to manualy decock with your finger on the trigger and thumb on the hammer.

It would be great for starters. It retails around 42k in Karachi. It has firing pin safety, loaded chamber indicator hammer block safety and sports a control lever that acts both as manual safety as well as decocker and low recoil + plus its light as well. \n\nThe Stoeger cougher is also a great weapon. It sports the same features and some models are available with accassory rails for lasers and tactical lights. Its slightly heavier but over all better quality and its controls are very easy to a maniupulate unlike the CF whose control lever is usualy very stiff out of the box. \n\nIn this range U can find a number of turkish CZ clone offerings. Excellent guns no doubt, but without a decocker u''l have to manualy decock with your finger on the trigger and thumb on the hammer. And for someone with No prior expereince its not something I would recommened. \n\nHowever if your license allows I would always recommend a .32 revolver as a first hand gun.

This one is from Hungary, not very common here.  It looks a bit like a Browning Hi-Power, but the insides seem to be more like a Smith & Wesson.  I haven''t had a chance to shoot it yet.

When the Romanian government disposed of a bunch of surplus rifles a few years ago, they cut them with torches, put the pieces in a plastic bag, and sold them as "parts kits."  These were then legal to import and purchase in the USA.  There are many businesses here that sell repair parts and tools.

It would be  great for starters. It retails around 42k in Karachi.  It has firing pin safety, loaded chamber indicator hammer block safety and sports a control lever that acts both as manual safety as well as decocker and low recoil + plus its light as well.  \n\nThe Stoeger cougher is also a great weapon. It sports the same features and some models are available with accassory rails for lasers and tactical lights. Its slightly heavier but over all better quality and its controls are very easy to a maniupulate unlike the CF whose control lever is usualy very stiff out of the box. \n\nIn this range U can find a number of turkish CZ clone offerings. Excellent guns no doubt, but without a decocker u''l have to manualy decock with your finger on the trigger and thumb on the hammer.

(276323, 9160, 0, 'oziris', 7857, 'Before purchasing an IZH-27', 1340697772, 'Hi,\n \nI am a newbie here and in shooting, too. I am looking for a hunting gun which I will also use for clay shooting (not much, let’s talk about some 200 rounds per month). My budget is EUR 500.00 as I am a little bit short of money and it looks like this situation won’t improve in the near future. I know that some people recommend purchasing a used Marocchi or Lanber for this price but in Central Europe where I live, it’s nearly impossible to get a  used shotgun made by these manufacturers for such an amount. Common prices in this category start from EUR 750.00. So in my point of view, it‘s a dead end. \n \nThat`s why I am thinking about the brand new Baikal IZH-27EM-1C Nickel 12ga that I can get at the local gun shop for EUR 425.00 which is perfectly in my limits. However, before purchasing it, I would like to hear advices and opinions from you, experienced connoisseurs of this Russian shottie.\n \nI have read tons of threads and articles regarding the IZH-27 and I am aware of possible risks (after all, it is not Beretta nor Perazzi). That’s why I would like to avoid as many issues as possible before purchasing it. Let me resume the most commons of them that I have collected on american, european and russian forums and that were reported by various users.\n \n•     ejecting both shells after firing only one, especially when the gun gets hot after a long shooting session. Possible solution: a thorough cleaning of internal parts or polishing ejector which somehow touches the  forestock as it moves. Another possible reason is that the carrier pushes the barrel selector too far, in such case, shortening the carrier’s tail will be necessary.\n•     ejectors tend to crack (?)\n•     the metallic part which is located between the over and under barrel (it’s the part which fills the space between the barells – sort of rail – sorry, I couldn’t find a proper word in English) – tends to get loose after several hundred of shots...\n•     during first 500 rounds, some kind of red colored sand or dust (perhaps the same preservative which can be found in the receiver of new uncleaned gun) comes out from the space between barrels (as described above). How can I avoid this?\n•     if two slugs are shot respectively from both barrels on a paper target, they do not hit the same spot. I consider this as normal but some people report a 1.5 feet difference (!) Is this possible?\n•     doubling (both barrels shoot at the same time). Possible problem: either bad technique when pulling the trigger or cleaning and lubing of internals is required – anything else that comes into your mind?\n•     curved rib (not aligned with the upper barrel)\n•     sometimes the gun tend to open spontaneously right after the shot is made (especially when magnum cartridges are used) – how can be avoided this?\n•     some users report that the empty shell can get under the ejector after being fired, then it’s a hell to get it from the barrel – that’s what I am most worried about – I suppose the solution would not be an easy one?\n•     the under barrel‘s hammer strikes weakly which results in failing the primer to ignite. This is caused either by some kind grease or a mess present in the internals (cleaning) or it can occur when the hammer spring comes in contact with the internal part of the stock on its way, hence it looses some portion of energy and when it finally hits the primer, the hit is not sufficient enough to ignite the primer. The Russians recommend fine polishing the right or left internal side of stock (the spot where the hammer spring comes into contact with the wood). Any other possible issues?\n•     after several hundreds of shots made in a short time (and especially if the outside temperature is high), it’s impossible to open the gun. Some people say all they have to do is wait like 20 seconds and then it’s possible to break the barrels. This happens when using cartridges with high brass (some other people state the contrary though). Possible solution: a thorough cleaning, lubing of internals or polishing the chambers with the steel wool\n•     the forestock finish tends to flake away after a couple of months\n•     front sight is not located right in the center of rib – what to do? I would like to install the Tru-glo sight but how, is that complicated?\n•     some people report that the chambers are too large which causes the shell would expand after the shot and consequently, the ejector is unable to remove it. Basically, when inserting the cartridge into the chamber, there should be no free space at the sides of the shell.\n•     stiffness, stiffness, stiffness...\n•     barrel selection not working at some guns\n•     safety is too rigid, reported problems with spontaneous activation/deactivation after the first shot.. how can this be cured?\n•     material used on some barrels is not equally distributed along the whole circumference. E.g. if you are looking down the barrel from the front sight, you can see some parts of the barrel rim are thicker while the rest is thin.\n \nThat’s it for the known issues. I know it is very unlikely to encounter all of these problems at the same time but I prefer to know about them and to have a solution if something happens. I think that a lot of these issues can be avoided  right in the shop by eliminating defective IZHs (provided the choice is wide enough). This is the list of things to be checked before purchasing the gun at the shop (I will skip the part regarding the proper gun fitting as this is a general question which applies to any shotgun). What to check:\n \n1.   quality of material used, mainly the equal diameter of the barrel rims\n2.   check the inside of the barrels if it is clean and equal\n3.   no signs of corrosion\n4.   quality of wood and finish\n5.   if the barrels are straight (sometimes the under barrel is not aligned with the upper one)\n6.   check if the gun is not „wobbly“, if all parts stay together\n7.   correct center position of the front sight\n8.   check the correct position of the rib (has to be straight)\n9.   check the diameter of both chambers by inserting the cartridge if it fits perfectly\n10. check the function of both ejectors and extractors using an empty shell. First, „fire“ both barrels and check if both shells are ejected, then repeat with only upper/under barrel.\n11. check the correct function of the under hammer. The Russians do that this way: they would cock the hammer by breaking the barrels, then remove the forestock, barrels off, then they would put an empty shell on the spot where the under hammer strikes, and then they would shoot. The empty shell is supposed to fly at least one meter high provided the stock is pointed to the roof. If it only flies like 1 feet, the hammer is not strong enough => problem.\n12. what else?\n \nMaybe some of you would think I am crazy and anxious by editing these long lists but there is a lot of problems related with this shotgun. I understand I can’t expect Beretta quality but what I am looking for is a reliable gun which will serve well without apparent problems like doubling, ejecting full shells or jammed opening. I also know I am not buying the prettiest gun of the world but I still believe this gun is a good product with quality material used. I am ready to clean the internals of the IZH right after the purchase. However, this brings me to another question: will I loose the warranty when cleaning the receiver? Am I allowed to disassemble the gun?

Registration is under progress and asap the NPO registration from income tax comes through; the official launch by a competition will follow. WE (me and hamza Khan) collaborated the first event on 1st of March 2011 and News1 covered it. Most of the Practical shooters need at least 250 rounds plus for the practice drills such as double tap.. (the gun eats the ammo like hungry dog), so it was almost impossible to be in this unless we switch to local ammo.\n\nI use my NP22 for it, on last Sunday used the Canik55 L120 clone of cz-75 pistol, C120 clone of cz75 compact and NP 22 pistols with almost little less than 3000 rounds through them, but the shooters were 5 with the same gun. I am counting this out of my normal practice mainly because I shot less than just 80 rounds.\n\nIf I have friends who want to work with timer then we go to Arabian Sea Country Club gun range, otherwise I have a private range where me and my lawyer friends go and practice what we want to. This Sunday I will try to go to A.S.C.C and anyone who wants to come is welcomed. Range fee is about 1000 per visit but will try to get it lessened.

Used ones are available at a shop in the basement of Nila Gumbad.\n\nAnd the historic Dianas were a class apart from the Dianas today - they had better wood used, parts were metal and not plastic, and guns were lubricated as to give the max out of box accuracy (this is what''s missing in the 350... it''s internals are not lubricated properly thus it sucks in the accuracy department until tuned)\n\nJust recently, some years ago, Diana restarted the model 35 for South Asia/Middle East only (with the same powerplant as the 31/34)... Same as the old 35, just more powerful (the one you have). And I think the 35 you have may be powerful than 31/34 as every airgun has a different velocity as even the 350''s muzzle energy varies between 17.5-23fpe.', 1, 1, '119.73.14.224', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You are vulnerable anytime your time and place are predictable. Vary your routine by changing the times and routes to and from work and home.\r\n  \r\n2. 	Also make sure to vary the length of time to and from work and home.  Do so by a factor longer than the perpetrators can comfortably stay in place (more than 10-15 minutes)\r\n\r\n3.	Avoid wearing clothing or accessories (including jewelry) that might indicate wealth or identify you as a foreigner or identify you as an employee of a wealthy domestic or foreign company.\r\n \r\n4.	Maintain constant awareness of your surroundings and avoid known hotspots. \r\n\r\n5.	Avoid traveling alon, if possible. Remember there is always safety in numbers.\r\n\r\n6.	Seek advice from truested locals as to safe and unsafe areas of the location both by day and at night if visit a new place. Avoid dimly-lit areas. Walk purposely and use the centre of the pavement, thus avoiding unlit doorways and being too close to the roadway.  \r\n\r\n7.	A privately owned car generally offers the best security.\r\n \r\n8.	If no personal or office vehicle available, use reputable, licensed taxi companies only, metro etc. Take note of the license plate number. \r\n\r\n9.	Keep your automobile in good repair and the gas tank at least half full. In some cases, having a trained and vetted driver may be the best option. \r\n\r\n10.	Always know the locations of your embassy and consulate offices if out of your home country.\r\n\r\n11.	Be aware of the street environment and pay attention to suspicious or erratic behavior in strangers.  If such behavior is observed, seek a safer location by entering a store or bank, or simply cross the street.\r\n\r\n13.	When traveling secure all your personal items. Especially money, passports, travel documents and laptops.\r\n\r\n14.	Keep personal, work and travel information on a strictly need-to-know basis.\r\n\r\nKEEP SAFE AND STAY VIGILANT…..ALWAYS\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nFahim', 1, 1, '211.24.242.118', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

One will have to do a lot of research on design and material type for making one. I dont know if people are already making them for sale. As far as i have read air regulators need to be serviced often. Also not every PCP is fitted with a regulator and they happen to be accurate. Regulator as far as i understand, just evens out air pressure for consistent velocities. Since a PCP doesn''t face recoil issues like a spring piston gun, the initial 20-30 shots should be considerably consistent. Accuracy may be compromised when the velocity drops by say ummm 100-150 fps or may be more right?\n\nAs for the velocities of the gun under question, if i remember correctly the initial 10-15 shots were between 55-60 fpe from a 0.25 cal BT65.

Here  it is:\n\n I seldom use the thumb safety(since I don''t carry a chambered gun) and fired this gun in \nLIMITED occasions. Around 500 (+-) rounds was fired out of this gun. It has been with me\n for around 3 years and it''s my carry piece(I practice with my CZ85B clone-Norinco NP40 \nand my 1911A1 standard model).\n\nAfter my last trip to the range last April. I was able to close the slide, replace an unloaded\nmagazine, & put it in my gun case. At home when I took it out of the case for cleaning, I \nnoticed that I could not cycle the slide anymore. It was STUCK hard. I went to the local\n distributor and they replaced the safety by removing the 2 pins on the plastic receiver. \n\nTo be fair, my PT145 PRO fires all the ammo that I fed it: Lead heads in major loads and target \nloads, FMJs in both factory or target loads. It''s accurate in the short distance I pratice with. \nAnd the recoil is quite manageable.

I took the order to the car where the women told me that they had recently shifted to the area,”\r\n told by Khalil. \r\nThose women then requested Khalil to deliver food for them to their house every day.\r\n “They asked me to go along with them in the car to see me where their house was,” \r\nKhalil added. \r\nOnce Khalil enter their house they offered him milk to drink. \r\n“They gave me milk that had some drug in it ... I fell unconscious after drinking it,”\r\n the Daily Times quoted him as saying. \r\nWhen Khalil got back his consciousness, he saw that three women were forcibly committing sex with him. For four consecutive days they sexually assaulted him and later threw him near Qayyumabad river, said assistant superintendent of police Asad Raza.\r\n “His condition is really bad ... his genitals are bleeding and he cannot walk properly,” \r\nsaid Raza. \r\nAccording to Raza those women must belong to some rich families from Karachi’s Clifton area.\r\n “It’s a complicated case ... but we are hoping that we will solve it soon,”\r\n he added."\r\n\r\nRead more: [url]http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/266461#ixzz1zGignOVF[/url][/quote]', 1, 0, '91.73.77.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This may include hammocks, garden benches, and umbrellas.\n\nRemember that every kind of patio furniture is designed to serve a particular purpose.

Despite seeing several air gun hunting videos (esp that of feral pigs and boars) and PG members'' experience, your comment did make me wonder if I''ve made any tall claims about the possible performance of this gun (and modern high powered air guns). You know well I''m a humble man (at least that''s what I think ;)) and shy away from making claims that aren''t practically achievable. So I conducted this test today. I got myself 3 pieces of wood, 3/4 of an Inch thick (0.75 inch) and decided to shoot at least 1 pellet through each to judge its penetration at approx 10 yards. If the pellet goes through, then we can safely assume that this air gun has enough power to cause serious damage at short distance. How the results came out was enough to convince me firmly that this air gun is serious business. I''ll in fact be EXTRA careful while operating this gun and this is the same advise i''ll give to EVERY ONE who buys this or any variable of this gun. Though we all should be very careful when dealing with air guns but this gun has all the potential to cause SERIOUS injuries and SHOULD be handled with EXTRA CARE.\r\n\r\nWhen i shot the 1st pellet at the wooden piece, it didn''t move although i was certain that I didn''t miss. Upon inspection i discovered that the pellet went completely through and hit the wall behind it, and made a considerable dent in the wall :p so I decided to place the rest of wooden pieces against that laminated board on which I''ve been practicing.

So the .22LR was >3 times powerful than the air gun :).\n\nHowever on a personal note, I do not see myself attempting to hunt a wild boar with an airgun (not on my own at least) as i surely wouldn''t want one of them "love bites" :p the habitat and game behavior in Sindh does not permit a hunetr that liberty. Things may be different in Islamabad and some areas of Punjab where these pests are often quite indifferent to people and passing by vehicles etc, hence providing a possible opportunity of a carefully placed, successful close ranged shot. \n\nHowever, I strongly second your point that more likely than not, even a SLIGHT deviation in the shot will result in an injury rather than fatality causing the animal a lot of pain and suffering. It may eventually die but not a clean death.', 1, 0, '202.61.45.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The weapons made in POF are not of American design even. Also, POF only makes ONE pistol, the PK-9, which is a Beretta Clone. The 92 FS costs around 550-600 dollars in America, which is not 10 times the price of PK-9. It is the ridiculous import laws and unreasonable profit margins charged by dealers that force the prices of such guns to go so high.\r\nAnother thing bro, you are just confusing iffi bro, that too with wrong information. \r\n\r\n@iffi bro, please increase your budget a few thousands and you will have many chinese options to chose from, there is CF-98, NP-22 in 9mm which should be around your budget. Also if you do decide to increase your budget, please look into Turkish Canik handguns as well. If you cannot increase the budget, then go for a chinese 30, that should be around 20-24 thousand, and you can buy ammo with the rest of the money.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.180.67.3', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

With several variations of the RSA in the market today, GLOCK&#8217;s goal with this voluntary exchange is to standardize the RSA to gain the best possible performance in each pistol.\n\nGLOCK&#8217;s product development team has modified various elements of the RSA. The new RSA compensates for all design modifications made to the Gen4 and allows the pistols to function up to GLOCK&#8217;s rigid quality standards and reliability goals.\n\nConsumers should note that Gen4 G26 and G27 models will not require a modified recoil spring.\n\n&#8220;We are moving proactively and quickly to standardize this part of the pistol. This is a voluntary exchange specifically for the new Gen4 models,&#8221; said Gary Fletcher Vice President GLOCK Inc. &#8220;We have developed a program for consumers to send in their existing recoil spring assemblies and receive new ones at no cost.&#8221;\n\nThe replacement of the Gen4 pistol RSA can be performed as part of the regular field-strip process; consumers do not need to take the Gen4 pistol to an armorer. Consumer&#8217;s wishing to participate in the exchange program are urged to call 1-877-745-8523 to order their new recoil spring.\n\nFor more information on the details and shipping requirements on the replacement program, visit [URL="http://www.teamGLOCK.com"]www.teamGLOCK.com[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nim sorry for starting this thread again but this recoil spring has caught my attention becuz im planning on getting a glock 19 for myself. collecting money for it for the time being.\n\nthe older recoil springs on the g19 gen 4 said 0-4 if im not mistaken? what does the newer recoil spring of the g19 gen 4 say? 0-4-3 or what? becuz if i go for gen 4, i dont wanna got for the one that had issues with its recoil spring. i know not all gen 4 g19s were giving issues. but some were. so y take a chance when someone is spending that much money. i wanna go for the later batches that were corrected n that can only  be recognized by checking out the recoil spring if im not mistaken.', 1, 0, '182.178.4.127', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I''ve been keenly observing different discussion threads on this forum but have never posted before. I am from Lahore and have a deep passion for hunting.  Currently i am on Baikal MP 153. Last season was, technically, my first for duck hunting. I have had some problems, some very close encounters but have not been very "prolific", to say the least. We''ve seen ducks flying around, close to our hide but almost never in firing range. I suspect there are areas for improvement in camo, calling and even location. I request senior member/veteran duck hunters to please contact me so that i can discuss the issues at length, exchange notes and prepare myself for the up coming season. my email is [EMAIL="farband@hotmail.com"]farband@hotmail.com[/EMAIL]. Laino, Avais, Tanveer and all other friends, i would love to have a passionate discussion on duck hunting over a cup of coffee. Please drop me a line on my email and we can take it up from there. \n\nI shall be really grateful\n\nThanks\n\nMustafa[/QUOTE]\n\n\nWelcome to Pakguns Mustafa Shah bro. Thanks for joining the forum. Yes you are right duck hunting depends on lots of things specially LOCATION, making a better hideout and wearing the proper camo clothing is also a part of duck hunting. Duck hunting is always a team work. You should also have resources to get informed about the duck positions on different area''s so you can determine the right time for duck hunting. I will suggest you to go though the hunting section for more information. All members and hunters including me are here to help you in any matter you want. \n\nhopefully upcoming hunting season will be fruitful for you.', 1, 1, '91.73.77.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I''ve been keenly observing different discussion threads on this forum but have never posted before. I am from Lahore and have a deep passion for hunting.  Currently i am on Baikal MP 153. Last season was, technically, my first for duck hunting. I have had some problems, some very close encounters but have not been very "prolific", to say the least. We''ve seen ducks flying around, close to our hide but almost never in firing range. I suspect there are areas for improvement in camo, calling and even location. I request senior member/veteran duck hunters to please contact me so that i can discuss the issues at length, exchange notes and prepare myself for the up coming season. my email is [EMAIL="farband@hotmail.com"]farband@hotmail.com[/EMAIL]. Laino, Avais, Tanveer and all other friends, i would love to have a passionate discussion on duck hunting over a cup of coffee. Please drop me a line on my email and we can take it up from there. \n\nI shall be really grateful\n\nThanks\n\nMustafa[/QUOTE]\n\nwelcome brother Mustafa Shah, I have answered for you please see post #69', 1, 0, '182.177.154.236', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

After zeroing to approx 25 yards went for a 10 shot group at approx 15 yards (results attached). And then started to check how it groups at a spot aapprox 50 yards (+/- 5) away ; that is where most of the pigeons and crows come and sit in the eve. Pellets tested were Gamo Match diabolo and Gamo pro magnums. Match pellets did well at about 22-25 yards but giving wider spreads at above mentioned distance. Pro magnums shot well and shots landed within a diameter of approx 3-4 inches (casual shooting not focusing a lot on maintaining accuracy). \r\n\r\nSoon two pigeons approx 4 feet apart sat on that very spot and i went for the larger one, took the shot and it dropped like a stone. Retrieved it and the pellet had severed its neck completely. I prepared it for the falcons and it rests in my freezer :p. Some 10 mins after that spotted a crow on another spot (some 30 yards) and took it down and that invited a whole "Baraat" of them corvids going about their usual shouts and cries. And about 10 or so sat 10-12 feet away from that spot where i practiced my shot. I was atleast 50 yards away and his myself behind a 3fx4f wall at my terrace. I had a clear view of crows and they could not see the barrel of my gun poking out ;) One after another they went down and within 10 mins i downed 6 out of 8 shots i fired.

I''ve been keenly observing different discussion threads on this forum but have never posted before. I am from Lahore and have a deep passion for hunting.  Currently i am on Baikal MP 153. Last season was, technically, my first for duck hunting. I have had some problems, some very close encounters but have not been very "prolific", to say the least. We''ve seen ducks flying around, close to our hide but almost never in firing range. I suspect there are areas for improvement in camo, calling and even location. I request senior member/veteran duck hunters to please contact me so that i can discuss the issues at length, exchange notes and prepare myself for the up coming season. my email is [EMAIL="farband@hotmail.com"]farband@hotmail.com[/EMAIL]. Laino, Avais, Tanveer and all other friends, i would love to have a passionate discussion on duck hunting over a cup of coffee. Please drop me a line on my email and we can take it up from there. \n\nI shall be really grateful\n\nThanks\n\nMustafa[/QUOTE]\n\nWelcome to Pakguns bro.

The biggest demerit , as considered by the historians and re-searchers is that the arrangements for proper translation of books were not made except very few chosen books, with the result that  the ship loads of books of immense value in their respective fields, spread all over Old Turkish Empire and all Islamic World in general became obsolete and very few people now know the old Turkish , so if these words are written in Turkish , we have a very little chance to know the meaning', 1, 0, '182.179.87.157', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

PG members specially Raja Yasir, Chaudary, Jogee, Imdad Ali, and Sohaib Hassan Helped me alot in my wonderful purchase.I really appreciate your help brothers. Thanks alot.\nWell I went to my village on Saturday and on Sunday early morning me and my brother (Sohaib Hassan) went to test the gun for the first time. Our real aim in the morning was to check the the range of the gun and the impact of pellets on wall. Well we both were quiet amazed by the performance of the gun. The maximum range we shooted at was 80 Yards and the impact was amazing. We did put on the scope and tried to zero it but no success actually we were using the scope for the first time. The pellets was hitting away from the target while the scope was on. I am going to put pictures of the gun and of our experience with the beauty and give a detailed review of the gun.\n[B]\nSHOCK ABSORBING SYSTEM (SAS):[/B]\n The Rod of the Shock absorbing System is very thick surely it will increase the life of the parts of the gun. This rod also prevents the damage of optics as said by the company. Due to this system I think the gun is very accurate even though it got a great recoil.\n\n[B]QUATTRO TRIGGER:[/B]\n  I really like the trigger of the gun its very comfortable for me. I am really satisfied with the orginal setting of the trigger but it can also be adjusted easily if you want to.\n[B]\n GUN BLUING: \n [/B]This is the only part from which I am not satisfied but who cares this doesn''t affect the performance factor. Although I think that the company should think about this factor of the gun. :P \n\n[B]ACCESSORIES WITH THE GUN:[/B] \n I got a 3-9X44E optima scope which turned out to be a good one.

He asked do you have any FIR registered of an attack on your life. I said no. He said then there is a no permit for you. I asked that i need to carry my NPB weapon for security reasons and current law and order situation.

All pakistan permits are issued from MOI and provincial are issued by respective DC office.\n\n\nI inquired about carrying NPB while 144 is imposed. He said if the 144 notification states that Carrying is banned then you cannot carry, otherwise you can carry in concealed manner. In 144 general notification, permits for displayed carrying are suspended. In short he said carrying of NPB weapon is allowed in concealed manner only. For display/brandishing of weapon, permits are issued. And currently none are being issued from MOI and DC office.\n\n\nI asked for the policy document if any. He said MOI has it.Now I am planning to visit MOI for the most wanted policy document so that we all can know the policy for the firearms handling lawfully.\n\n\nSecondly I was travelling in Islamabad two days back, near Serena, with 2 of my friends in my mehran when i was stopped at checkpost. The police constable asked us to step out. Which i did. He did a body search, before he could feel the weapon on me , i told him that i have a weapon. He asked me to show. I took it out, said that i will unload it , unloaded it and handed over to him. just the gun. He had a deep look to it. Asked me to show the license. which i did. he matched the number. He asked about the number of rounds i am carrying. i said 15, he asked for the magazine, which i handed over to him. He felt the weight of the magazine. and handed over the gun and magazine to me and started examining the license. Meanwhile i loaded the gun in front of him and holstered it.

Thanks alot.\r\nWell I went to my village on Saturday and on Sunday early morning me and my brother (Sohaib Hassan) went to test the gun for the first time. Our real aim in the morning was to check the the range of the gun and the impact of pellets on wall. Well we both were quiet amazed by the performance of the gun. The maximum range we shooted at was 80 Yards and the impact was amazing. We did put on the scope and tried to zero it but no success actually we were using the scope for the first time. The pellets was hitting away from the target while the scope was on. I am going to put pictures of the gun and of our experience with the beauty and give a detailed review of the gun.\r\n[B]\r\nSHOCK ABSORBING SYSTEM (SAS):[/B]\r\n The Rod of the Shock absorbing System is very thick surely it will increase the life of the parts of the gun. This rod also prevents the damage of optics as said by the company.

The second most important thing with the airgun is the sling as the gun has got some weight on it. A bipod which is not really useful. And stock spacers which I even didn''t bothered to touch.\r\n\r\nThanks again dear members for helping me. :)[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBrother Shahab Kiani congratulations for buying a nice looking gun.

Although, before every hunt we always discuss the whole hunting plan with our clients who are all experienced ethical hunters, explain them all the details, show them the routes followed by the pigs during each beat and take all safety measures etc ... YET ... despite all such measures they do sometime shoot the piglets & the females erroneously ... for which they always feel sorry ... and we regret their inadvertent act. But the true fact may be noted ... that when the beat starts and the boars come running "SO FAST" towards you in big herds ... amidst thick forest & bush with so little time (sometimes seconds) at your hand ... it becomes very difficult to differentiate between the males & the females or recognize the juveniles ... so mishaps like these do happen but the good thing is that the percentage of such mishaps is very very small and never exceed over a handful of unwanted slaughters.\n\nOn the other hand, our beaters who are mostly local farmers think so differently from ethical hunters like us ... For them, it does not matter if its a male or a piglet because they consider it a pest and harmful for their crop and they won''t spare it if they ever get a chance. Since its quite a laborious job to eradicate boars with their own limited resources, they make the best use of these paid beats with foreign hunters and don''t spare the piglets & the females. \n\nHaving said all this, it may not be out of place to mention here that under the prevailing conditions in Pakistan, the wild boar is indeed a pest and it''s population is too much and our handful of hunters who shoot altogether 50 to 100 boars (average) in the whole season can''t actually cause an irreparable damage to this animal. Thanks for listening. Your comments are welcome. Kind regards.\n\nPS : Ajmal Virk Sb, Yes Sir .. we procure temporary gun permits for our foreign hunters from Ministry of Interior so most of our hunters bring their own weapons which they can carry & use in Pakistan but only under our auspices since we are their guarantors.', 1, 1, '182.177.98.28', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It''s the IZH-27-EM-1C with the nickel receiver, 12gauge. The action was stiff as expected altough everything worked fine. I used the dummy shells to test the ejectors, both were OK. However, the sand and debris were almost anywhere, on the ejectors sears, in the forend, I was even able to "hear" the presence of the sand in the trigger spring when I was pulling the trigger very slowly.\r\n\r\nSo after getting back home, I disassembled the gun completely, well, except for the cocking cams and disconnectors located in the frontal part of receiver, because of the pin holding the cams - it''s nicely finished so I didn''t want to mar it. \r\n\r\nEVERY part has been cleaned, polished and lubed. Needless to say that there was a lot of orange-ish sand in the receiver, and metallic shavings, too. I also tried to wipe out the yellow sand located in the mid gap between the barrels. However, this task was more complicated than I thougt. I sprayed progressively the whole pint (!) of WD oil in the gap. A big portion of the sand came out, however, I can still see some grains coming out here and there. BTW, while applying the WD, I put a piece of cotton wool in the gap and now I am unable to get it out... I am wondering if it can harm anything?\r\n\r\nIt took me one week to re-assemble the gun, as I could only work in the evenings.\r\n\r\nAfter re-assembling it, I could see a little improving as for the opening/closing. However, it was far from Beretta [IMG]http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif[/IMG] So I cut the ejector springs which helped a little but not as much as I expected. \r\n\r\nI have also put a little vaseline on the hammer springs as I read somewhere here that it helps to reduce the friction which occurs when the springs are compressed. However I only put a little of it as I know too much vaseline can cause troubles. But it didn''t help much either...\r\n\r\nFinally I installed the tru-glo front bead and took the gun to the range. (BTW did I say you how difficult it was to unscrew the original beads?)\r\n\r\nI put some 240 shots through my IZH. I tried to shoot quite quickly as I wanted the barrels and the action to become hot so the possible problems would show up. \r\n\r\nIndeed, two of them occured: \r\n1. the top lever jams. Not always, only sometimes. Let''s say one time out of fifteen. This happens even if the chambers are empty. I am unable to move the lever from his center position to the right and I have to put a lot of effort to finally move it. So I guess waiting 20 seconds to open the action would''t help as this happens even without the shells loaded. I think the problem is somehow related with the contact of the locking bolt and the barrels, inside the receiver. \r\n\r\n2. Sometimes, the right ejector doesn''t eject fully the shell . The shell just stops halfway out. It is not exactly extracted, but it''s not ejected either. This happened 6-7 times out of 240 shots. I guess the ejector spring is too short, I took 8 coils. Not a big deal, I will order some new and will took less coils. I also observed that this problem dissappeared when I changed the ammunition.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I am proud to say there was not a single double shot. The IZH worked flawlessly. Except for the problem I described above, ejectors were perfect, no live shell ejecting. I also switched the barrel sequence to see if the ejectors would be OK this way, and they were. (BTW, did you know that to cancel the sequence when the top barrel is selected as first, there is no need to open the action? Just move the top lever to the right until you hear a gentle click, and there you go, the sequence is cancelled and the under barrel is selected as the first one again).\r\n\r\nAs for the performance, I am quite impressed. Of course, I am a rookie and maybe a pro would laugh on my poor russkoye gun, but still, it broke clays easily and if some didn''t broke, it was the shooter''s mistake, not the gun''s. Looks like a performer!\r\n\r\nHowever, I was a little bit disappointed when trying the slugs. I shot a couple of slugs to check if the barrels are correctly aligned. I have to say that there was a vertical difference of 15 inches in the point of impact between two slugs fired respectively from the under and the top barrel. The range to target was 37 yards. Horizontally, the impacts were aligned. But obviously the top barrel shoots higher than the under barrel. I don''t know, maybe it''s supposed to be this way and maybe it was my fault as I was pretty tired from shooting 230 rounds in 90 minutes [/FONT][IMG]http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif[/IMG] I also noted that the gun shoots a little bit to the left although I was aiming at the center of the target. I will have to re-check this.\r\n\r\nThe main surprise came when I got back home. I tried to clean the barrels but oh my! the bore is covered by some strange crusty stuff that I have never seen before. I was afraid the chrome finish was wearing out or whatever, but it looks like the slugs created a pretty stubborn layer of lead on the bore sides. Now I am unable to clean it, do you have any advice please?[/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 0, '81.89.56.250', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Finally I got the gun, I purchased it one week ago. It''s the IZH-27-EM-1C with the nickel receiver, 12gauge. The action was stiff as expected altough everything worked fine. I used the dummy shells to test the ejectors, both were OK. However, the sand and debris were almost anywhere, on the ejectors sears, in the forend, I was even able to "hear" the presence of the sand in the trigger spring when I was pulling the trigger very slowly.\n\nSo after getting back home, I disassembled the gun completely, well, except for the cocking cams and disconnectors located in the frontal part of receiver, because of the pin holding the cams - it''s nicely finished so I didn''t want to mar it. \n\nEVERY part has been cleaned, polished and lubed. Needless to say that there was a lot of orange-ish sand in the receiver, and metallic shavings, too. I also tried to wipe out the yellow sand located in the mid gap between the barrels. However, this task was more complicated than I thougt. I sprayed progressively the whole pint (!) of WD oil in the gap. A big portion of the sand came out, however, I can still see some grains coming out here and there. BTW, while applying the WD, I put a piece of cotton wool in the gap and now I am unable to get it out... I am wondering if it can harm anything?\n\nIt took me one week to re-assemble the gun, as I could only work in the evenings.\n\nAfter re-assembling it, I could see a little improving as for the opening/closing. However, it was far from Beretta [IMG]http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif[/IMG] So I cut the ejector springs which helped a little but not as much as I expected. \n\nI have also put a little vaseline on the hammer springs as I read somewhere here that it helps to reduce the friction which occurs when the springs are compressed. However I only put a little of it as I know too much vaseline can cause troubles. But it didn''t help much either...\n\nFinally I installed the tru-glo front bead and took the gun to the range. (BTW did I say you how difficult it was to unscrew the original beads?)\n\nI put some 240 shots through my IZH. I tried to shoot quite quickly as I wanted the barrels and the action to become hot so the possible problems would show up. \n\nIndeed, two of them occured: \n1. the top lever jams. Not always, only sometimes. Let''s say one time out of fifteen. This happens even if the chambers are empty. I am unable to move the lever from his center position to the right and I have to put a lot of effort to finally move it. So I guess waiting 20 seconds to open the action would''t help as this happens even without the shells loaded. I think the problem is somehow related with the contact of the locking bolt and the barrels, inside the receiver. \n\n2. Sometimes, the right ejector doesn''t eject fully the shell . The shell just stops halfway out. It is not exactly extracted, but it''s not ejected either. This happened 6-7 times out of 240 shots. I guess the ejector spring is too short, I took 8 coils. Not a big deal, I will order some new and will took less coils. I also observed that this problem dissappeared when I changed the ammunition.\n\nOtherwise I am proud to say there was not a single double shot. The IZH worked flawlessly. Except for the problem I described above, ejectors were perfect, no live shell ejecting. I also switched the barrel sequence to see if the ejectors would be OK this way, and they were. (BTW, did you know that to cancel the sequence when the top barrel is selected as first, there is no need to open the action?[/FONT][/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000][FONT=Lucida Grande][FONT=arial][B] Just move the top lever to the right until you hear a gentle click, and there you go, the sequence is cancelled and the under barrel is selected as the first one again).[/B][/FONT][/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#61482A][FONT=Lucida Grande][FONT=arial]\n\nAs for the performance, I am quite impressed. Of course, I am a rookie and maybe a pro would laugh on my poor russkoye gun, but still, it broke clays easily and if some didn''t broke, it was the shooter''s mistake, not the gun''s. Looks like a performer!\n\nHowever, I was a little bit disappointed when trying the slugs. I shot a couple of slugs to check if the barrels are correctly aligned. I have to say that there was a vertical difference of 15 inches in the point of impact between two slugs fired respectively from the under and the top barrel. The range to target was 37 yards. Horizontally, the impacts were aligned. But obviously the top barrel shoots higher than the under barrel. I don''t know, maybe it''s supposed to be this way and maybe it was my fault as I was pretty tired from shooting 230 rounds in 90 minutes [/FONT][IMG]http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif[/IMG] I also noted that the gun shoots a little bit to the left although I was aiming at the center of the target. I will have to re-check this.\n\nThe main surprise came when I got back home. I tried to clean the barrels but oh my! the bore is covered by some strange crusty stuff that I have never seen before. I was afraid the chrome finish was wearing out or whatever, but it looks like the slugs created a pretty stubborn layer of lead on the bore sides. Now I am unable to clean it, do you have any advice please?[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nSir, Refer to red lined quote, IMO the sequence of barrels of  IZH-27 could not be changed in the way you mentioned in your post. \nWith this gun you need to push the trigger forward for changing the sequence of barrels shots. and for reversing the sequence you have to open and close the gun.

Around 1000+ grams as mentioned by the gun makers. The trigger is nice and light and breaks cleanly. The slide doesn''t move as smoothly as i thought but maybe it will smooth out after few hundred rounds. There is no rattle in the slide and the frame and slide fit is reasonably tight. Slide stop/release lever is hard at this time and would have been nice if it was bit beefier, i cant reach it easily and is bit stiff.\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00590.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00591.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00572.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe grip safety nice and smooth but i like the Taurus''s more. In-fact i think this gun is not as well made as Taurus PT1911. But its cheaper and that''s what you have to compromise, Quality. I think its not bad for the price it comes in. If you can afford more or willing to pay 100k+ for a Taurus, then be my guest and go for it. But I''m not spending 100k''s on a Taurus. The mags are very well made and hold 8 rounds. Mec-Gar makes very good quality mags. I think Mag quality is better then Taurus''s.\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00597.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 0, '119.154.229.65', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

More people would realize how much work goes into raising healthy lamb, how much work is it to slaughter 10 roosters, having a bee hive in your backyard can provide you 80-130 Kg pure honey and other useful products every year. And if you want to you can supplement all that by hunting and growing vegetables and fruit in your yard.

Just my 2 cents. \n[QUOTE=bird of paradise;422978]in my opinion there can be no rational justification for hunting.

I don''t know if its a good thing or bad. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00596.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAll in all its a good budget 1911 for the people who can''t afford a Dan Wesson or other quality 1911 and sensible enough not to pay a 100+ on a Taurus. If the the difference between Taurus and Zigana is less then 15k then Taurus is a better choice as it has more aftermarkets and looks better. But Zigana is bit more accurate. here are some pics of my first shots with Zigana M1911. \n\n[I][B]Shooting Zigana M1911:\n\n[/B][/I]First shot were test shot fired from 10M. Ammo was Armscor 230grn FMJ''s. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00600.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00602.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThen 15M, 5 Shots double handed. Again Armscor Fmj''s. First shot was a flyer, as i got a surprise break ;)\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00603.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00605.jpg[/IMG]\n\nDidn''t did so good at 25M. But the gun is definitely very accurate. I got tired and was flinching. Will shoot again at 25M and update results. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00606.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 0, '119.154.229.65', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

My manual says this: "In the IZH-27EM-1C, the barrels are fired in the sequence: the bottom barrel-the top barrel.

They put it for decocking the firing pin, not to fire it.[/B][/QUOTE]\n\nI think Glocks are more reliable then Caniks, even then many people don''t feel comfortable or safe carrying a chambered round in a glock. Yet youtube is full of videos where people had accidental discharge with Glocks. On other hand some people trust Glocks with their life. Its matter of personal preference. I don''t prefer a Decocker on a striker fired gun, and i don''t prefer a Turkish gun no matter who''s clone it is. And i''ll say again the looks and package is good but didn''t like the gun. The DA trigger pull is insanely hard on this gun. Even if you manage to decock the gun safely :behindsofa: you won''t be able to pull the trigger that hard in a panic situation. \n\n2.

If you shoot the deer with the rifle and mention the name of      Allaah, and hit the deer, and it dies from that shot, then it is halaal and      it is permissible to eat it. If you catch up with it when it is still alive,      it is essential that you slaughter it properly. \r\n          Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was      asked: Are the birds that we shoot with rifles and they died halaal or not?      We find that some birds that we shoot have died before we can say the name      of Allaah over them. \r\n          He replied: \r\n          Yes, if you shoot a rifle when hunting birds or rabbits or      deer, and you say the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger, then it will      be halaal, even if you find it already dead, because the Prophet  (peace      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to      flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he      said: “If you release your (hunting) dog and mention the name of Allaah over      it, then eat.” But if it is still alive and able to move then you must      slaughter it properly and mention the name of Allaah over it when      slaughtering it. If you do not do that and it dies, then it becomes haraam      for you. But attention must be paid to mentioning the name of Allaah when      pulling the trigger, because if you do not mention the name of Allaah then      it is haraam to eat it, even if you forget, because the Prophet  (peace      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to      flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he      said: “Do not eat of that over which the name of Allaah has not been      mentioned.” End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb. \r\n          Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is      it sufficient for me to say Bismillaah wa Allaahu akbar when inserting      bullets into the rifle when hunting, or must I mention the name of Allaah      when pulling the trigger of the rifle? \r\n          He replied:\r\n          What you must do is mention the name of Allaah when shooting,      and it is not sufficient to mention the name of Allaah when putting the      bullets into the rifle, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of      Allaah be upon him) said: “When you shoot your arrow, then mention the name      of Allaah” (saheeh – agreed upon, from the hadeeth of ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may      Allaah be pleased with him); this version was narrated by Muslim).

I understand you fully. \n\nMy thought is that in case of home defence, I would face the attackers and my family would not be in the line of fire (hopefully). My imaginary scenario is that I have had enough advance warning (sounds of breaking glass, door alarm etc.) that I am able to arm myself while the BGs are still outside. The game plan is to keep them outside by suppressive fire or shoot them if they make a breach. In case of determined and targeted attack I would probably lose any way because they would be better armed than me (being criminals, they would probably use automatic weapons).\n\nStill reliable FMJ that I KNOW will feed properly is better than other choices.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nUsing fmj rounds inside a house has its own issues.FMJ rounds have a tendency to ricochet and travel at terminal speed in uncontrollable vectors.I have seen a 30 cal round ricochet off two walls and embed itself in a solid teak wood door completely.\n\nAlso  "all armies carry fmj" argument is not applicable to civilians.Armies rarely have to answer for colletral damage caused in their actions.There is a reason why most "law enforcement rounds" are predominantly JHP because they can face civil liability in the civilized world.\n\nWhen facing a home invasion or dacoity you don''t want to "suppressive fire " the tool need for that is not available even on PB license anymore.\n\nWht you want is effective shots that incapacitate the attacker quickly ad efficiently and contrary to what bollywood and hollywood say you need more than just wound them to stop them.You need either clean effective shots to the CNS to shut down the body immediately(requires 1000s rounds t practice doing head-shots in a crisis situation) or you need to open huge wound channels in 2,3,5(however many it takes) shots that allow rapid blood loss to incapacitate the aggressor.\n\nFor example someone shot in abdomen with a fmj can stay alive and fighting for hours but a jhp that severly damage the intestine and introduce bacteria and fecal matter into blood stream will cause shock to set in minutes.', 1, 1, '202.69.12.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(281920, 9142, 275786, 'Ahnab', 6111, '', 1342969484, 'I had an opportunity to check out the TP-9 at a dealer over the weekend. I spent almost 45 minutes closely inspecting and dry firing it. Unfortunately, I couldn''t take any pictures as the dealer wouldn''t allow it. Note that the TP-9 is a Turkish-made clone of the famous Walther P99 AS. Anyway, the following are my impressions:-\n\n[B]SIGHTS:[/B]\nI actually loved the sights. Compared to the Piranha-F, the sights were a marked improvement; big, bold and highly visible "glow-in-the-dark" dots made sight alignment and target acquisition infinitely quicker, a BIG plus in a CC gun. I think having an adjustable rear sight on the TP-9 is somewhat of an overkill, but if the gun proves to be decently accurate at 25 meters and beyond (something I''d be amazed of, considering it sports a 4 inch barrel), then I guess the adjustable sights would definitely come in handy; for strictly CC/SD purposes, I think it''s unnecessary. But still, kudos to Canik55 for atleast providing us with options (even if a majority of us might not avail it).\n\n[B]BUILD QUALITY:[/B]\nJust like any other Canik55, the build quality was SUPERB! The slide-to-frame fitting was perfect with absolutely no rattling. I field striped the gun and found no factory marks or burrs anywhere, although there were a few nooks & crannies that could''ve used a bit more polish. The barrel locked in the slide perfectly, with no excess margin or space. Also, there was no flexing in the polymer at all. I removed the magazine and squeezed the grip with both hands as hard as I could, and the polymer remained rigid as steel. Lovely! After reading about the "bulging" issues of the CZ Duty and some people complaining of polymer flexing in Taurus pistols, I was somewhat sceptical regarding the polymer quality of the TP-9. I''m glad my scepticism was proved wrong; the construction is solid through & through.\n\n[B]ERGONOMICS:[/B]\nOk, this is where personal preference and our individual body builds will come into play. First off, let me start by saying that I have large, beefy hands. I personally hate the fact that, while handling Glocks (for example), I have to cant my wrists forward in order to line up the gun with the target. The grip angle of a LOT of polymer guns just doesn''t suit me (including Glocks, Styer M9 and the Caracal). That being said, I was pleasantly surprised just how comfortable the TP-9 felt in my hands. The grip angle is less extreme than the aforementioned brands and more along the lines of other traditional handguns. The default backstrap was small for me so I asked the dealer to swap it with the larger one that comes with the gun (more on accessories later). With the larger backstrap, the gun felt like a part of my hand. It felt VERY comfortable, sighting & aiming was easy (requiring no wrist canting or arm contortion) and the overall balance was spot on! Also, I loved how Canik55 stuck with the traditional magazine release button instead of adopting Walther''s method (which I personally dislike). The slide release, however, was a bit hard for me. But I guess this is something which might smooth out after the break in of the gun.\n\n[B]TRIGGER:[/B]\nHere''s the interesting part, the TP-9 works pretty much like a conventional DA/SA pistol (something which other striker-fired pistols don''t). In SA mode, the trigger has more take up than I''m happy with, but there''s no creep and the trigger breaks clean & crisp. The reset is almost instantaneous, allowing for quick follow up shots. In DA, there''s negligible take up and practically no creep, and the trigger pull is actually lower than the Piranha''s, allowing for a much smoother and faster initial shot. Also, unlike other polymer pistols with plastic triggers, the TP-9''s trigger doesn''t flex. I dry fired the gun PLENTY of times, and on no occasion did I feel any flexing; the trigger is solid and pulls beautifully.\n\n[B]SAFETIES:[/B]\nConventional striker-fired handguns, unlike hammer-fired pistols, feature practically no external safeties at all (other than the Safe-Action Trigger). The TP-9, on the other hand, doesn''t have the Safe-Action Trigger safety, and instead features an ambidextrous decocker (located along the upper edge of the slide, just ahead of the rear sights). To understand the function of the decocker, you must first remember that the TP-9 acts much like a traditional hammer pistol. In that respect, the TP-9''s decocker does exactly what a decocker in a hammer pistol would do; decock the firing mechanism. Once decocker, the TP-9 goes into DA mode; longer, heavier trigger pull which prevents any negligent discharge. Once the slide is racked (or a shot is fired), the TP-9 then goes into SA mode (just like conventional DA/SA pistols); shorter, lighter trigger pull. If the gun is in SA mode (i.e. the striker is cocked), a red coloured pin protrudes from the rear of the slide, just below the sights. It''s impossible to miss or ignore. Once the deocker is pressed, the striker is decocked and the red coloured pin goes back into the slide. This pin, and especially it''s location, is ideal for letting the gun operator know the current condition of the firing mechanism. The TP-9 also features a "loaded chamber" indicator on the upper part of the slide, just behind the ejection port. The TP-9 also features a firing-pin block. Also of note, there is NO external safety lever, so you can''t carry the TP-9 "cocked & locked".\n\nPersonally (and this is strictly my opinion), I don''t trust any gun with safeties I can''t manipulate or a firing mechanism (hammer or striker) which I can''t decock at will. That''s the reason why I''ve stayed away from polymer/striker handguns and put my faith in good ol'' fashioned steel & hammer. The TP-9, however, has gotten me quite interested because of it''s featured decocker, allowing me to carry the gun chambered without any worries of accidentally pulling a light trigger.\n\n[B]ACCESSORIES:[/B]\nThis is where the TP-9 truly shines. The gun comes packaged with 2 18-round magazines, a cleaning brush, an autoloader (which, for some reason, is missing in all the TP-9''s I''ve seen), 2 grip backstraps which you can swap to fit the gun perfectly in your hand (the backstrap is attached via a roll pin on the grip), a kydex holster with an index finger lock & retainer, and 2 base units to which the kydex holster can be attached to; a paddle unit and a belt unit, allowing you to carry the gun in either a paddle holster or a conventional holster tied to your belt. Just these accessories alone make the TP-9 a very delicious & tempting buy!\n\n[B]CONCLUSION:[/B]\nThe more I think about the TP-9, the more I''m tempted to buy it. Right now, I''d say I''m 85% sure I''m definitely getting a TP-9; the remaining 15% of my mind is still waiting for a range report to decide fully. But, all in all, the TP-9 appears to be an excellent gun for CC and with it''s accessories loadout, it''s next to impossible to find a gun which gives you so much value for money. If, like me, you''re a metal & hammer pistol guy and is looking for his first polymer/striker gun, then look no further; the Canik55 TP-9 is definitely the way to go!', 1, 1, '110.36.195.23', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

What if you break something in your TP9 or any gun for that matter which is sold here, what would you do?

This debate has turned fathers against sons, best friends against one another, and........well you get the point. The author is of the opinion that there are of course pros and cons to each family of rifle, and I refuse to engage in what is "best". As one who loves them all, especially the AK and AR series, I thought I''d pass on some of the knowledge I have gained over the years concerning these wildly different weapons. As a bonus, I''ll toss in my knowledge of another favorite family of weapons at the Bunker, just because they are very popular these days and I often ramble about them. So, here, for the aid of those hammering one another in the debate, is some unbiased, non-slanted, untainted raw knowledge about the AK, the AR, and the Mosin Nagant. \n\nStuff you know if you have an AK.\n	\nStuff you know if you have an AR\n	\nStuff you know if you have a Mosin Nagant\nIt works though you have never cleaned it. Ever. 	You have $9 per ounce special non-detergent synthetic teflon infused oil for cleaning. 	It was last cleaned in Berlin in 1945.\nYou are able to hit the broad side of a barn from inside. 	You are able to hit the broad side of a barn from 600m. 	You can hit the farm from two counties over.\nCheap mags are fun to buy. 	Cheap mags melt. 	What''s a mag?\nYour safety can be heard 300m away. 	You can silently flip off the safety with your finger on the trigger. 	What''s a safety?\nYour rifle comes with a cheap nylon sling. 	Your rifle has a 9 point stealth tactical suspension system. 	Your rifle has dog collars.\nYour bayonet makes a good wire cutter. 	Your bayonet is actually a pretty good steak knife. 	Your bayonet is longer than your leg.\nYou can put a .30" hole through 12" of oak, if you can hit it. 	You can put one hole in a paper target at 100m with 30 rounds. 	You can knock down everyone else''s target just from the shock wave of your bullet going downrange.\nWhen out of ammo, your rifle will nominally pass as a club. 	When out of ammo, your rifle makes a great whiffle bat. 	When out of ammo, your rifle makes a supreme war club, pike, boat oar, tent pole, or firewood.\nRecoil is manageable, even fun. 	What''s recoil? 	Recoil often used to relocate shoulders thrown out by the previous shot.\nYour sight adjustment goes to ''10'', and you''ve never bothered moving it. 	Your sight adjustment is incremented in fractions of minute of angle. 	Your sight adjustment goes to 12 miles and you''ve actually tried it.\nYour rifle can be used by any two bit nation''s most illiterate conscripts to fight elite forces worldwide. 	Your rifle is used by elite forces worldwide to fight two bit nations most illiterate conscripts. 	Your rifle has fought against itself and won every time.\nYour rifle won some revolutions. 	Your rifle won the cold war. 	Your rifle won a pole vault event.\nYou paid $350. 	You paid $900. 	You paid $59.95.\nYou buy cheap ammo by the case. 	You lovingly reload precision crafted rounds one by one. 	You dig your ammo out of a farmer''s field in Ukraine and it works just fine.\nYou can intimidate your foe with the bayonet mounted. 	Your foes laugh when you mount your bayonet. 	You can bayonet your foe on the other side of the river without leaving the comfort of your hole.\nService life, 50 years. 	Service life, 40 years. 	Service Life, 100 years.\nIts easier to buy a new rifle when you want to change cartridge sizes. 	You can change cartridge sizes with the push of a couple of pins and a new upper. 	You believe no real man would dare risk the ridicule of his friends by suggesting there is anything but 7.62x54r.\nYou can repair your rifle with a big hammer and a swift kick. 	You can repair your rifle by taking it to a certified gunsmith, it''s under warranty! 	If your rifle breaks, you buy a new one.\nYou consider it a badge of honor when you get your handguards to burst into flames. 	You consider it a badge of honor when you shoot a sub-MOA 5 shot group. 	You consider it a badge of honor when you cycle 5 rounds without the aid of a 2x4.\nAfter a long day at the range you relax by watching "Red Dawn."

After cleaning your rifle you have a strong urge for shishkabob.\nYou can accessorize your rifle with a new muzzle brake or a nice stock set. 	Your rifle''s accessories are eight times more valuable than your rifle.

It''s a match grade one, and the pull is presumably below 1lbs.\nI''ll rate loudness at 4/5 without the silencer, and at 2/5 with silencer (keeping Diana 350 at 3/5, Airforce Condor at 5/5)\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten003.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten004.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten005.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten006.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten007.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten008.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten009.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe only range I have tested it on paper till now is 25yds @16ft/lbs, and am attaching the results below\n\nDefiant pellets - 14gn\n25 yds\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bhjh001.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAir Arms pellets - 16gn\n25 yds\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa002.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa003.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa001.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa004.jpg[/IMG]\n\nEncircled groups were the tightest (some here are with Defiants, some with AirArms)\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa005.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '119.73.6.64', 0, 1, 0, 0, 9302, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

BUT the only thing against it not favoring you is that it is a full size gun. you are going to wear it in IWB holster. With the weight, size and height it has it is a very hard to conceal gun.\nStoeger is a full size yet a smaller gun relatively to CZ999, Rotary barrel doesn''t matter that much. I don''t like Stoeger ONLY because of the safety on the slide. It HURTS my hands a LOT when I have to rack the slide in fast action secondly the whole side has a cutaway and is slippery, used it at the range twice with sweaty hands and it was mighty difficult to rack it from any other place other than the serrations and on serration half of them are covered by the HUGE safety. it is on a heavier side, extremely sturdy but NOT as sturdy as CZ999. Same weight in a smaller package.\nIF it was me then at the price range of 55k NOTHING beats CZ999.\nhere i would ask sadatpk brother to give his input as he LOVES it more than any other gun and he has had pretty good results as it fits him perfectly.\n\nCZ from Czechoslovakia is a different matter altogether.. they are what defines what a GUN is; without going into the history, i assure you that if you go for the CZ75 family you will NEVER ever be disappointed from the quality, shooting ease, and the value it offers.

IMHO there is no other gun that offers such extreme value for money as CZ family does.\n\nCZ75 Duty is a polymer framed wonderful gun, light to carry extremely reliable, accurate and excellent gun. for CC(conceal carry) it is also one of the top choices but will not beat cz75c.\n\nSo the list for you should be\n\n1)Cz75C\n2)Cz 75 Duty\n3)CZ999\n4)Stoeger.\n\nAlso keep in consideration..\nNP34 ... a chinese clone of SIG P228\nCanik 55 L120 (Clone of Cz75b) Alloy frame\nCanik 55 C100 (Clone of Cz75c) Alloy frame\n\nCanik is a NATO certified gun.. their certifications follow the strictest rules of EPVAT, in Turkish guns i would only recommend you to look into "Canik 55" family only rest are not as good as Canik though price is same.\n\nI own NP22 and have shot about 1200 rounds in a day. YES 1200 rounds in a day.. and the round count has neared 7000 and broke the locking lug spring.. The gun comes with a spare set of springs..[/QUOTE]\nRespected Atiq sb,Cz999 is a wonder ful gun with superb result in its price range,After 5000 fires my piece is still like new,there is no voilence mark inside, field striping is very easy,slide is fit to frame in an excellent way, there is no rattling till now,It is damn accurate gun Far ahead than any turkish gunIMHO,as it owns the tradition of Zastava Arms and euro metallergy.\nSir Atiq sb, no gun can beat this beast in its price range,but this is sad that it is no more in Markeet here in punjab,however Np22,Np34 r also Sig clone of very high quality,and the real value for money,IMHO thisCz999 just enjoys the honorary rank of CZ,however its younger br is in Market with the name of Ez,not Cz as i think Zastava ia also a great name and its product r in service of Serbian Army,which is another proof of Quality control,another worth-mentioning is that in the long span of 5000 fires I have not faced even a single FTE or FTF.', 1, 0, '119.154.99.76', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(282882, 2289, 67113, 'psg-1', 8052, '', 1343246352, '[QUOTE=Abbas;67113]Salams, a lot of the friends that come here to PakGuns are relatively new to the world of firearms and are thinking about or have recently got a new license and are looking for the right right gun to buy for their SD or HD (Self Defense, Home Defense) needs. Many new threads are opened everyday about the topic and it gets repetitive and the information becomes less useful over time. \n\nI would like to suggest a couple of guns for the first time users in various price ranges and a mini one line review of the suggested firearm. Details and discussion on any of them can be found by clicking the search button on our panel bar and typing the desired gun name i.e Glock or CF98.\n\nTo start off with I would like to say that the most important thing when keeping a gun for self defense is knowing how to use it properly. All guns are useless and counter productive if the shooter does not have a reasonable level of proficiency in the use of the firearm. Proficiency only happens by firing atleast 200 to 300 rounds in a controlled environment like a range and at a target. Once you are hitting a head size target at 10 to 25 feet you are good to go since in 90 % of the cases that is the maximum distance your gun will be used for defensive shooting.\n\nMost people new to firearms do not understand what calibers are and what difference it makes. In a nutshell calibers are difference sizes of bullets, .22 being small, 9mm being average and .45 being large.  The difference it makes to [B][U]New Users[/U][/B] is that generally the larger the bullet, the higher the recoil and lower the accuracy of the second shot. I suggest selecting 9mm as a caliber for your defense needs. It''s like Goldilocks porridge not too hot, not too cold and just right ;) \n\nIn the world of firearms and defense the most important thing is reliability and all the weapons listed here have proven their worth by multiple tests. Ofcourse the more you spend the more reliable firearm you will get. \n\n\nIn 9mm there are several guns available in the market in varying price ranges. A suggested few are:\n\nIn the Rs. 30,000 price range there is the [B]CF-98[/B].\n\n[IMG]http://www.leverarms.com/Pistol%20Images/Norinco%20CF98.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIt is made in China and is a decent medium size light weight gun. It is quite accurate and probably the best you can buy around Rs. 30,000.\n\nIn the Rs. 45,000 price range, your options open up quite a bit and there is the [B]CZ 999, the Canik 55 and the Stoeger Cougar 8000.   [/B]\n\n[B]CZ 999:[/B]The CZ is a great gun, extremely accurate and well made. You cannot go wrong with it. It is a high quality copy of the SIG 226 pistol which retails for around Rs. 350,000. It is made in Serbia. \n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/cz999-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Canik 55:[/B] This is my personal favorite. It''s a clone of the CZ75 B and is the most accurate sub Rs. 100,000 pistol I have ever fired. Very high quality copy. Made in Turkey. I got mine for just under Rs. 40,000.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik552.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Stoeger Cougar:[/B] Probably one of the most discussed pistols at PakGuns, this pistol is very highly regarded by all for it reliability and size. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik555.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Taurus PT 99[/B]. If you are a fan of Beretta and large shiny objects appeal to you ;) I suggest looking no further than the PT 99 by Taurus. It is one of the best pistols of the world in any price range. Very high quality piece and one of my favorites. I have shot over 4000 rounds though my pistol and it''s still brand new. Very accurate too. The only drawback is the size, it is a large frame pistol and not really comfortable to carry around. Very highly recommended. Price Around 54 K.\n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/taurus_pt99.jpg[/IMG]\n\nApart from these guns, nothing in my opinion can be justified because of the insane prices. The only gun that I would recommend spending more money on is either the Glock 17 or the Glock 19. The 17 sells for around Rs. 225,000 currently and the 19 for Rs. 250,000. The difference between the two is that the 17 is larger and more accurate and the 19 is smaller and slightly less accurate than the 17. The reason you pay a much higher cost is reliability and durability. Glock is absolutely the most reliable handgun in the world and it will last multiple lifetimes.\n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/glock17.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nA closing note on magazine capacity ammunition type and durability.\n\nBoys will be boys and every manufacture that makes products aimed at men will stress "more is better" but that is not necessarily always the case. Although a 20 round magazine will get "wow''s" from your friends, more rounds in your magazine will make your weapon larger and heavier. For most situations you do not practically need anything above 13 or 15. Infact that is excessive as well, what you can''t do in the first 5 shots you aren''t going to do in the next 20. So if the handgun you are choosing has a magazine capacity of 13 or 15 you are good to go. If you feel you need more rounds, then that''s what the extra magazine is for. \n\nAmmunition type. For target shooting and practice you use normal 9mm rounds which cost around Rs. 35 (POF, CHINESE). For Self defense however you use "Hollow Points". These bullets are specifically designed for defensive purposes and will expand upon impact thus having a higher probability of knocking your target down. They cost around Rs. 65 to Rs. 250 depending upon make. I would suggest atleast firing a box of 50 rounds of hollow points though your gun to make sure they work well before loading your magazines with them.\n\nDurability. Most people will go on and on about barrel life and forging technology and yada yada. Yawn.... :rolleyes: \n\nA gun will last "FOREVER" if maintained properly. You must clean your gun within 24 hours of use or it starts to get damaged. Barrel life is nonsense and is of no concern to 99 % of the people. Ammunition is so expensive that if we take the CF 98 whose barrel under the worst conditions still lasts 3000 rounds then that means you fired about Rs. 100,000 worth of ammunition though a Rs. 30,000 gun. Not very probable, if someone has that much money to spend on ammo then I''m sure they will buy a better gun first.\n\nAnd last but not least remember that if you own a firearm you are a grownup and a responsible individual. Anger, Machoism and Irresponsible behavior have no place in the life of an firearm owner. Before you own firearms these three things should be ingrained in your psyche. \n\n\n1). EMPTY OR LOADED, NEVER EVER POINT YOUR GUN AT ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DESTROY.\n\n2). ALWAYS ALWAYS KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER TILL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THE TARGET.\n\n3). NEVER CARRY/USE A GUN UNLESS YOU NEED TO.\n\n\nHope this little write up helps all our new brethren to the wonderful world of Firearms ! If anyone has any question I and all PakGunners will answer them gladly. No question is too basic or foolish, we are all learners here.[/QUOTE]\n\nws,\nvery good information thanks. i was reading some of the threads. everyone seemed to know a lot about guns. this post was a welcome surprise.\n\n\nliked the forum rules btw: be polite, we all have guns...lol.', 1, 0, '39.47.169.46', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is the Titanium version and very light like some of the members pointed out. It also comes with a ported barrel for easier to handle recoil and is very very accurate. The ported barrel is a real help as I also have a Smith and Wesson 2" .357 in steel and the difference in recoil is alot. I do carry this on the ankle many times and the light weight really helps.

When one is aiming at competition(which clearly the op is :)), it always helps to have the best equipment no matter what the sport is. It actually gives the user benefit in the sense that he/she can concentrate on the mistakes being made and correct them. Same holds true to shooting. An interesting thing that ED bro said, that a professional driver can beat us on a normal road even if he is in a Mehran, I think that''s because he has actually driven perfect machines and in doing so perfected his FEEL for driving. For example people like me, who have just shot combat handguns, have reported "Unintentional" discharge of a Tactical Sports (I havent shot one myself) due to a very light trigger, when shooting the first time. And I think if I try to race in a Ferarri for the first time on a normal road, I''m positive I''ll bang it up :D. I think a person who starts shooting a TS regularly will become a better shot quicker, even with combat handguns. So a good competition gun will help you to learn the sport quicker vs a combat handgun. The same holds true for combat handguns alone, a good gun will help you improve shooting much better and quicker than a clone. :)\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.185.70.188', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Its new in the market and I am sure there will be many more generations to come before it becomes equal to if not near to the quality of the Glock... but there is much time to go on that.

I do believe that most of us will never end up in a Rambo like situation and if we did... we would turn and run rather than have a standoff which may require our weapons to go through sand, mud, or water pit firings!\nAnd if nothing else, here is something to think about... 12years ago, you could find a Glock at any gun shop for about 60k/rs, then the imports stopped and the price jumped.  What do you think is gonna happen when this Caracal also stops coming to Pak..  So guys its also a great investment.  Once this thing takes off in the West and it will, we are gonna be off their export list QUICK...  Something to think about.

Strike One pistol, which is also known as  (Swift bird) in its Russia-made version, is intended to compete for the role of a service pistol for various military and law enforcement forces (in Russia and elsewhere). It will be also offered for civilian sales as self-defense and/or sport weapon, where permitted by law. At the moment of this writing (mid-March, 2012), Strike One pistol is still in prototype / pre-production stage, and its final version most probably will differ from the ones shown here in certain respects. One most noticeable feature of the Strike One pistol is its extremely low bore axis, which helps to control recoil and muzzle rise during rapid fire.\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Type \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Semiautomatic, Single Action (pre-cocked) \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Caliber(s) \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]9x19 Luger/Parabellum, 9x21 IMI, .357SIG, .40SW \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Weight unloaded\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]750 g \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Length \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]210 mm\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Barrel length\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]128 mm\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Magazine capacity \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]17 rounds \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strike1.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strikeone.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strikeoneb.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/QUOTE]\n\nApart from cosmetic changes guess which gun it resembles? minus the front serations, the texture of the grip and reduce the barrel length to 4 inches and it looks like a Caracal F', 1, 0, '59.103.200.9', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Mine came with a Straight 8 sight which while easy to align were nothing spectacular.\n\nKindly explain this term STRAIGHT and DOT because i am not familiar with these terms.\n\nSecondly what about the quality of this pistol.IS it reliable as compared to other pistols available in the market like stoeger,CF-98 etc.\n\nI am waiting for your reply.\n\nregards [/COLOR]\n\n\n[QUOTE=Abbas;234193]Salams,\n\n\n\nRecently I was given a Caracal F and Caracal C by the guys at Caracal Pakistan and they asked me to test and review them. I told them plain and simple that the review will be unbiased and I would need a 1000 or so rounds to test it with. They obliged and yesterday I tested the Caracal to my satisfaction.\n\nA few words on Caracal before I go on:\n\nThe Caracal is a new combat handgun from the U.A.E. It was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who first worked at Glock and then moved to Steyr to design the Steyr Mannlicher M & S family of pistols. Caracal''s are made to compete directly with the likes of Glock, Steyr and XDM line of pistols. There are three versions, the F, C & SC which respectively compete with the Glock 17, 19 & 26. It is perhaps also pertinent to mention that Caracal owns the German Shotgun and Rifle manufacturer Merkel which produces the Caracal handguns under licence in Germany as well. \n\nOn to the review: \n\nThe Caracal came in a decent quality plastic box, included in it was the gun, two magazines and a users manual. The manual is in English and well written. The F itself is about the same size as the Glock 17 however it has a 4.1 inch barrel compared to the 17''s 4.5 inch barrel. The gun comes with a safe action (DAO) trigger which functions great and breaks smoothly, the trigger pull is about 5 lbs. The gun comes with two different kind of sights, conventional straight 8 ones (in which you align the two dots to form a figure 8 to be on target) and a quick sight which roughly starts from above the barrel chamber area and extends to the muzzle end. Mine came with a Straight 8 sight which while easy to align were nothing spectacular. The sights also seem to be part of the slide itself which is not a positive. On the back of the gun is a loaded chamber indicator which tells you when the gun is loaded.\n \nThe finishing of the slide and the polymer frame is quite good and defiantly in the exclusive Glock/Styer neighborhood. It weighs about 125g more than the Glock 17 at 750g which is quite welcome as the gun feels very solid to hold. Holding the gun for the first time felt amazing, infact I think it is the most point able gun I have ever held. It gives you Steyr like depth of grip with Glock like solid feel without the Glock grip angle (which does not suit everyone). The checkering on the Polymer grip is very comfortable to hold and even after shooting it quite a lot it still felt good. It does have a ambidextrous mag release but the slide release is only on the left hand side (for right handed shooters). There is a picatinny rail on the front for mounting accessories and a Glock like serial number plate on the bottom of the frame but strangely no serial number printed on it. Overall the polymer frame is top notch/high quality. The disassembly lugs situated right above the trigger finger are made of hardened steel and make disassembly surprisingly even easier and quicker than the Glock (I didn''t realize it could get easier). \n\n[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '94.76.192.142', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The competition was narrowed down between a TS and a Czechmate, but i am inclining towards the TS now.\nHowever, i did try a colleagues TS who had modified the trigger to less than 1LBS pull AND i can VOUCH that i experienced accidental discharges (double tap) on MORE than a few occasions. I then gave up on my quest for the TS. most of my handguns are and always have been combat /tactical style pistols, but the eye opener was when i took the SP-01 Phantom to the range and shot a respectable 70% on the first go. With a SP_01 Shadow borrowed at the range, i immediately felt the difference in the trigger pull (smoother as it does not have a firing pin block) and proceeded to shoot in the 80 percentile range.\nWhile i had my heart towards a Czechmate, i think the advise is correct, the red dot sight would be  a major drawback and when it comes to the price-value-utility the TS would be better. I think i will give an unmoded TS a go when i get back to Pakistan next month. \n\nAs for the debate below, everyone is right in their own opinions in DIFFERENT circumstances. \nfor example, a complete novice with a a world class weapon could miss entirely, whereas an expert can display a decent performance using a mediocre weapon.  \nHOWEVER< when it comes to two persons of near or equal skills, the better platform would DEFINITELY give a strong edge. A better platform is also critical where accuracy requirements are strict -as they are in a bulls eye competition.  short of being the top 1% accurate shooter in the world, i can wager confidently that a .30 bore local T/T will NEVER consistently score a 90%+ score  on a 25 yard bulls eye target.
