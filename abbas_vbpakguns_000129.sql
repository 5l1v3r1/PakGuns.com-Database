(40438, ' @Abu Hafs\nHmm, You probably know, there are two categories here in the UK. one is for rifles (where the barrel is rifled) including rim fire and centre fire (.22, .243 winchester etc etc), and the other one for Shot guns, including 12g, 20g, .410 (all smooth bores).\nWe need a FAC for the first category. and a SGC for the 2nd. If the airgun is above 12ft/lb then it also falls under the first category, and we need an FAC (as it also has a rifled barrel).\nI hold SGC for the shotty. The Rapid7 is currently under 12ft/lb. Easily tunable up to about 30ft/lb if you have FAC. So as my airguns are under 12ft/lb an FAC is not needed for them.\nIndeed a standard air rifle (I think you meant under 12ft/lb) is more than enough to take rabbits at under and up to 40 yards. Both my air guns are under 12ft/lb and are deadly accurate (deadly for the rabbits ;) ) and will happily take lethal head shots upto 40 yards. Same goes for pigeons. Rapid is a lot more accurate due to having virtually no recoil on it. It can take pigeons upto 50 yards without any issues as long as you get an accurate head shot. Pigeon head is a lot less solid than a rabbits head :)\n\nAs you say, I would also go down and see how much land he has, and how far it is from any public roads etc as well as whats there in terms of game.\n\nYou dont need a permit to hunt on private land. But if I was you, I would first get a written permission from the owner. because if you get pulled over even by the traffic police guys, and they find an airgun in the boot of your car (and a knife too) then you may get done for carrying a FIREARM on a public road if you have no justification for it. And if you get caught on the private land (in case a neighbouring farmer or member of public complains that there is an Asian bloke carrying a rifle) then the police will definitely turn up and require proof that you are allowed to shoot on that land. Then th written permission will come VERY handy. They will also give your air gun a FREE thorough check to see if it is above 12ft/lb. But anyway, once you have the permission, and are looking for what gun to buy, I can probably provide you info at that stage for tuning and making sure you are legal. It is more important to stay legal than have a few extra yards in the killing range :)\n\nWebley is an excellent brand. Ever since I first tried Webley Vulcan MK II about 10 years ago, I fell in love with that gun so much that I took one to Lahore and gifted it to my younger brother. He was a kid at the time. I also converted it to take the gas strut instead of the spring. I am telling ya, it is so accurate and powerful that i still amaze myself when i fire it now even after 10 years. \n\nWebley fx 2000 is a pre charged like my Rapid7. Webley make some VERY good airguns but when it comes to pre-charged pneumatics, there are only two names IF you dont want to compromise. Theoben Rapid, and the second one is Daystate Air Wolf which came out a long after the Theoben. I have never fired an Air Wolf, but from what I hear and read on reviews, it is same, or in some sense better than Theoben, but that could be a debate in itself.\n \nSo if money is not an object, and pre-charged pneumatics is what you want, then please only consider these two names. New Theoben set-up including a divers air bottle etc will cost you about £1200. Although you can pick up a used one in good condition for under £700 easily and under £600 if you look hard enough.\n\nThere is a lot more info on your questions, but hope you have enough to go on for now.  Do a google on these names to see what magnificiant guns they are, and feel free to ask more brother.', ''),

They were used more then the 1903 Springfield. Alvin York used an Eddystone M1917 and a Colt 1911 on the day that he earned the CMH. The Model of 1917 was produced in three places. In the Winchester Factory, the Remington Factory in Ilion NY, and by a subsidiary of Remington, at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone,PA.

It will sit five meters below the waves of the Indian Ocean, surrounded by a vibrant coral reef and encased in clear acrylic offering diners 270-degrees of panoramic underwater views.\n \n"We have used aquarium technology to put diners face-to-face with the stunning underwater environment of the Maldives", says Carsten Schieck, General Manager of Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa. "Our guests always comment on being blown aw ay by the colour, clarity, and beauty of the underwater world in the Maldives, so it seemed the perfect idea to build a restaurant where diners can experience fine cuisine and take time to enjoy the views - without ever getting their feet wet."\n \nCreated by MJ Murphy Ltd, a design consultancy based in  New Zealand, Ithaa''s distinctive feature is the use of curved transparent acrylic walls and roof, similar to those used in aquarium attractions. "The fact that the entire restaurant except for the floor is made of clear ac rylic makes this unique in the world," continues Schieck, "We are currently planting a coral garden on the reef to add to  the spectacular views of the rays, sharks and many colorful fish that live around the area.', ''),

About 4000 trees were grafts on existing Kahoo trees and 6000 pure Olive plants are in different stages of plantation. We get many visitors from Government officials and otherwise wanting to study the plantation specially after a detailed study conducted a few years back came to the conclusion that this is not viable in Soon Valley. We planted everything they said that could not be successful and more and all of it without water which we countered with drip irrigation. There are about 1000 peach trees as well as apples and other assorted fruits and vegetables. Staple crops like wheat we only grow without the use of any fertilizer or pesticide for home use, as it is the best kind of organic ''aata'' there is, everything else tastes like flour compared to it. We estimate that by 2011 the plantation should start to give it''s optimum output and if InshAllah all goes well the plantation should be able to supply 10 % of Pakistan''s Olive Oil needs.\n\nI''m glad the attending members enjoyed the trip.

(40912, ' [quote=Dr Zakir]Malik sahib if I may ask for how much you have purchased M4 for . I am thinking of buying an  M1 can you compare between the two[/quote]\n\nI got it about 3 4 years ago.. I dont remember the price.. but it was 165 or 185ks.. but the dollar was for 61 then.. now its 83.. so do the math..\n\nThe M1Super90 was I think a joint venture between HK and Benelli.. It was what put the O in offensive combat shotguns.. I have heard lots of good stuff.. thats the one I started out to buy. But the M4 is an improved version and newer so I guess that sold me out.. \n\nHowever.. It is a bit dated.. and the M4S90(with Fixed stock/pistol grip and 5 shot)/ M1014 (with ret stock, pistol grip and 9 shot) is the successor to the legendary M1..\n\nThe gas piston is more or less the same as considering AK47.. so its a plus.. and will not foul up even after extended shooting.. \n\nIf you want a inertia driven one I would HIGHLY recommend the M2 SUper 90.. It is so lightweight and well balanced all rounder.. for home defense and you can take it hunting and skeet shooting even.. (but be advised use good ammo in lighter loads)..\n\nI am also unsure as to the availability of the M1 over here.. but if you want to collect it as a classic.. sure why not! Otherwize do try out both the M2 and the M4.. see which better suits your requirements and feels better.. when you  hold them side by side, you will know the difference in their designs and purposes.

(40920, ' IMHO - i will explain this in 2 ways,  number 1 which is more likely and which is more in practise.  if a person shoots someone, police comes, collects the shells, and especially ASK/INVESTIGATE witnesses or the  personals related to that victom, and Police gets clue, police grabs that person ( shooter ), then its possible that police may send that person''s gun and used shells to the forensic lab, waits for the positive/negative results. and yes, then on positive reports Police will do action regarding the law. \n\n\n              2nd situation: if police finds some fired shells on crime scene. has no clue about suspects, i repeat, if there are no suspects, then its another case. by only those fired shells. police cannot trace out the shooter or the exact gun ( from which the bullets were fired )  no matter if that gun is registered to that very same police station, if still police does grab the shooter than its miracle \n\n           \n      No offense meant - \n\n\n      Note: i am not talking about those scottland yard guys or FBI/CIA etc. :lol:', ''),
(40921, ' ASA Abu Hafs,\nHmm, I never did really look into the CO2 rifles. I heard a couple of years ago once the govt also banned these rifles, and asked every one to voluntarily give it in to the police stations etc. "coincidently" they then decided to finish the ban (when they thought now they have all or majority of them) and so the people who didnt hand them in, could keep theirs....quite cunning I say :)\nAnyway, so I think they could be good, but crossman is no match for Webley (webley Vulcan for example). The rabbit stopper is a good gun, but believe me, Webley vulcan or eclipse is far superior. \nYes you ask a very interesting question. Yes there are very good and affordable springers around. To me, the top one I have tried and absolutely love it after 10 years of having it, is a Webley Vulcan (Mark II if you can get one). It is full legal power at 12ft/lb and is VERY accurate gun, even without the telescopic sights. I bough mine for only £150 and it was in IMMACULATE condition without even a scratch although now it looks pretty different after being used for so many years in Deepalpur / Dipalpur :)\n\nIf you look patiently and hard enough there are plenty of good examples of these guns about and surely you will find one. Have a look online on different UK hunting forums and they all have a for sale section usually. Also look online, in online free ads papers etc. They go for anything from £40 to £150. A friend of mine bough one in quite bad condition for only £20 which is a steal really. He spent some time and effort on it, and last weekend I tried it out and it shoots like a dream. absolutely spot on the target.\n\nAir guns are a little bit like cars. Both need good metal. Good workmanship. Precision and care. Following is a very rough comparison: Cheapest ones are Chinese (e.g QingQi cars and Chinese air guns).... better ones are American (e.g Chrysler, GM and Crossman).... better ones are German (BMW, Mercs, VW and in guns Weihrauch ), but then the top hand made stuff WAS Traditional British (e.g Rolls Royce, TVR griffith and "Webley and Scott", Theoben, Diana, etc)\n\nThe above comparison is in no way accurate, just a very rough comparison of how the steel and workmanship has shaped the manufacturing quality around the world. Mind you, I would also like to add that now the Chinese are manufacturing excellent quality stuff too, and the Brits are losing most of the industry because they simply can not afford to pay their workers enough to fulfil basic needs such as house, family health, schools, and food. And now most of the British names I mentioned above no longer make guns in Britain and for sure due to this reason, the new Webleys are lower quality and precision when compared to the older models that were made entirely within the UK.\n\nSo if you can find a good example of Webley Vulcan in .22 (preferably Mark II) then I am sure you will never want to sell it again. You may sell it to upgrade to a more expensive gun, but trust me you will still not want to :)\n\nDo you know how much land does your friend have altogether?', ''),

This increases the diameter of the wound channel, and produces massive shock  and damage to produce a one shot stop. \nThese Bullets produce three results\nPenetration  of at least 12 inches through Clothing \nIncrease in Diameter to  1 1/2 times or so \nIt should not lose weight by disintegration otherwise the above two will not be achieved.\nThese are very conflicting requirements and a lot of research,experimenting and advanced metallurgy has resulted in these bullets. I named some companies bullets a sthese are available and have developed a name over the years', ''),

(381293, 'Testing .22LR''s: Armscor &amp; Winchester HP''s Accuracy at 50 M''s. Salams, \n\nRecently we''ve established that the Brno is quite capable of giving sub one inch groups at 50M''s. The ammo I was using was Eley Club which is basically the bread and butter round for shooters. Lately it''s been unavailable or it''s prices have gotten a little out of hand. I wanted to test the cheapest .22 LR ammo I could find on the market which was the Armscor .22 LR (Rs. 11/bullet). Also some Winchester HP''s (Rs. 18/bullet) had been lying around for a while and I wanted see what results I could get from it. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4723[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4725[/ATTACH]\n\nTested the Armscor first. After shooting the first two rounds I noticed that the Armscor being higher velocity ammo was shooting a little higher and slightly to the right than the much lower velocity Eley Club. I did [B][U]not[/U][/B] Zero the scope accordingly and just tried to shoot a group. \n\nTarget below, 35 rounds shot at 50m.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4724[/ATTACH]\n\nI was surprised at the target. It was shooting quite consistent for cheap ammo. I regretted only having one box of it to shoot otherwise I''m sure the next target would have resulted in a much tighter group. The few shots you see outside the group is me trying to see where to aim to hit the bull. In this case it was 8 o clock on the outer 10 line. Testing a few shots I went back to shooting in the group. \n\nNext came the Winchester. Impressive for Hollow Points specially considering it was at a distance of 50m''s.  It was shooting even better than the Armscor. I need to get a proper rifle rest, that would make the group size much tighter. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4722[/ATTACH]\n\nBoth targets:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4726[/ATTACH]\n\n[B]Conclusion[/B]: Newer shooters don''t need to start with Eley Club or Sport, the much cheaper Armscor is good enough till your skill level comes to at least the provincial level. I believe it will consistently give one inch groups at 50m''s.', ''),

(41361, ' A. A lot of shooters have wondered what happens when a bullet is fired vertically. Popular lore includes such mis-ideas as the bullet burns up falling back down, it comes down at the same velocity as its original muzzle velocity, and probably one that says it disappears in a time warp.\n\nThe two best references on the subject are "Hatcher''s Notebook", (by Julian S. Hatcher, 3rd edition, June 1962, Stackpole Books, ISBN: 0811707954) which includes a chapter on bullets fired vertically, and an article titled "Terminal Velocity and Penetration Studies," by Lucien C. Haag, which appeared in Vol 2, No. 1 of Wound Ballistics Review. This information is excerpted from both.\n\nFirst, it must be understood that recovering vertically fired bullets is difficult because wind causes them to drift from the expected vertical line. (This probably accounts for many of the myths.) \n\nHatcher''s tests indicated that on the average, vertically fired rifle bullets reach about 9000 feet in altitude (slowed from their muzzle velocity by air drag and gravity to zero velocity), taking about 20 seconds to reach maximum height. Then, pulled by gravity, and slowed by air drag they take about 40 or so seconds to return. Bullets fired vertically come back base first. Why? Read on!\n\nHatcher describes one experiment with the 150gr M2 Ball bullet fired vertically. When it came back from vertical (round trip time was about 42.9 seconds) it left only a 1/16 inch dent in a soft pine board that it happened to hit. (Not exactly what it would do at 2700f/s, eh?) Based upon this and similar tests Hatcher concluded that the impact velocity was about 300 f/s, which from additional testing appears to be the terminal velocity (the maximum free fall velocity which is limited by air drag on the body in question) of that bullet falling from any height in the atmosphere. (If I remember correctly from my limited parachuting experience the terminal velocity of a falling person is somewhere around 130 mph or about 200 f/s.) \n\nWhat does not substantially change, even at extreme range, is the rotational speed of the bullet that was imparted by the rifling (around 300k rpm) since the effect of air drag on the rotational velocity in negligible. Thus the gyroscopic action, once the projectile is stabilized, tends to keep the bullet oriented in the same direction, thus the base first (well ok, original position trailing end) return. It is interesting that this was not commonly known until just before WWII. The British had lots of dud antiaircraft rounds that all came back base down, or more correctly oriented to the same elevation as shot from the gun. BTW, this is what raises hob with traditional long range small arms ballistics. With lots of elevation on the bore (past 2,000+ or so yards) at the far end the bullet is actually falling sideways and all frontal air drag algorithms are out the window.\n\nInterestingly, Hatcher describes an experiment that shows the gyroscopic stability at work. They loaded the 150gr M2 flat based bullet backwards and found that the round trip time was a bit shorter (about 30.4 seconds) due to the bullet being "streamlined (point down) on the return trip. The drag on the upward trip was not as greatly effected due to the high muzzle velocity. No estimated impact velocity was given but it would have been somewhat higher due to the lower air drag on the bullet since it was coming down point first.\n\nThe Haag article used a ballistics computation program to calculate vertically fired bullet performance and came up with results comparable with Hatcher''s work. Using bullets ranging from the .22 rim fire to the 180gr .30 caliber spitzer in the .30-06 the time of flight (up & back) ranged from a low of 25 seconds for the .25ACP to a long of 77 seconds for the M193 ball. Maximum altitudes ranged from a low of 2288 feet for the .25ACP to a high of 10,103 feet for the 180gr .30-06. Terminal velocities ranged from 134 f/s for a tumbling .22 Short to a high of 323 f/s for the 180gr .30-06.\n\nHaag calculated the performance of the .30cal 150gr M2 ball round fired by Hatcher as a maximum altitude of 9330 feet and a round trip time of 57 seconds which is, for all intents and purposes, the same as Hatcher''s observations.\n\nAs a point of interest a velocity of about between 160 and 200 f/s (±) is needed to penetrate skin. However, one could still be seriously injured if struck by a falling bullet.', ''),

In that case, I would certainly prefer a handgun over a shotgun or rifle, as it will enable you to use one hand to open doors, operate light switches, hold a torch, phone, etc. Personally, I don''t like rail-mounted lights unless I am a part of a SWAT team, due to the simple reason that the muzzle goes wherever the light beam goes.

(41488, ' The shotgun IS the perfect home defense weapon BUT you have to sacrifice some mobility when wielding a shotgun. Plus there''s the matter that in all such teams, be it SWAT or other, the members work together and cover each others'' backs. They are trained to work as a group. I''m sure most of us would like to have a few SWAT guys around when the BDs come knocking at the door, but.... The fact is, as an armed civilian, most of the time you have to work alone and cannot rely on others.\n\nJust try and do a few 180-degree turns with your weapons. Unless you are well versed with shotguns (which I know you are :)), I believe that a handgun will be faster.\n\nIf only they could make a 12 Gauge in handgun form... now that would be absolutely cool.\n\nOne final word: learn to defend yourself with whatever you have.

(41526, ' "The SPAS-15 is a dual-mode 12 gauge shotgun manufactured by the Italian company Luigi Franchi S.p.A..\n\nThe weapon is based on the SPAS-12, and has similar pump-action/semi-automatic firing modes. In semi-automatic mode a gas piston drives a bolt carrier and rotating bolt. In pump-action mode the same components are driven by sliding the fore-end backwards. Pump-action mode is required to reliably fire low-pressure (less lethal) ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. Switching between firing modes is done by pressing a button above the foregrip, and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the SPAS-15 is fed by a detachable box magazine. The gun features a folding stock and a pistol grip safety.\n\nThe SPAS-15 is currently used by various law enforcement and military agencies, including some units of Italian army and the Carabinieri, although several Italian special forces units have dismissed it after adoption as its bulk and excessive weight, mostly due to the detachable box magazine, compromised maneuverability in critical situations. It still remains legal to purchase and possess by civilians in Italy as any other smoothbore long arm (shotgun), but having Franchi ceased production of the SPAS-15 around the year 2005, the firearm is getting extremely rare to trace. In 1996, the United States banned the importation of the SPAS-15, although it can still be legally owned and sold. In Canada, the SPAS-15 is classified as a Prohibited Weapon and cannot be legally owned or imported except under very limited circumstances."\n\nNow from the above provided information you can clearly see that its not something that you should spend 235K for. I found an interesting review by a user which is as follows;\n\n"The Long Wait finally ended on Tuesday.  My local dealer phoned to say my SPAS 15 had arrived.  He sounded very excited on the phone and told me he''d never seen anything like it !!   Having waited 7 months 7 days, I could wait no longer, and I immediately booked the rest of the week off on holiday!  I went straight home to pick up the gun, my first impression on opening the box was WOW!  It looks awesome !  I was pleasantly surprised to find the gun lighter than I had expected, and narrower.  I got two magazines with the gun, and the total cost was 900 UK pounds (approx. 1500 US Dollars). \n\nWednesday was my first day of fun with the SPAS 15, I loaded up with Winchester Super X Slugs, CBC Slugs, Express 00 buckshot, and some Gamebore 12 ball 36 gram buckshot.  The SPAS 15 ate it all without a hitch.  Recoil when fired from the shoulder was low, and the gun was very controllable.  Having exhausted my ammo supply I toddled off back home to get some more ammo - this time I loaded up with 28 gram #9 target cartridges.  The SPAS was very well behaved when fired single handed (and using the shoulder sling of course) and the muzzle stayed on target.  There was only one misfeed with a #9 target load and that was when fired from the hip, supported by both hands but not touching my body. \n\nSo far I''ve tried over 200 cartridges through the gun, and I''m VERY happy  it!   I had loads of fun on Saturday when I was shooting a a metal plate at distances of 80-100 yards.  Now I have to stock up on ammo as I didn''t realise how hungry this gun would be! \n\nCleaning the gun was a bit fiddly, everything inside the barrel shroud had a light coating of oil which collected the burnt powder.  I removed the stock, but I couldn''t manage to get the bolt and bolt carrier out of the receiver, but I know they should come out! \n\nI will try to take some photos over the Christmas holidays, and will email them sometime in January. \n\nTo summarise, the SPAS 15 is awesome.  I was impressed by the looks, feel, quality and performance of the gun.  I love it!"\n\nNow this is something which came from my knowledge but as you mentioned that you want Epert Panel opinion, i dont think it will matter much.', ''),

This was at a time when guns were very rare and not many people possessed them.\n\nAnyhow his antics had the exact opposite effect to the one desired by our old friend. He inadvertently attracted the attention of some local hoodlums who could not resist the temptation of getting their hands on these new things called rifles that they had heard so much about,to think the money they could make if they had a gun they would be unstoppable.\n\nSo the bandits decided to pay him a visit late one night, they knew they had to be ruthless and show no mercy to the elderly security guard because if he got the chance he would blow them away with the rifle.\n\nSo they set about him, beating him relentlessly until uncle chaukidhar sahib breathed his last breath.\n\n\nWhen the thugs checked under the bed for the gun, to their utter disappointment  they discovered a stick.\n\n\n\nMoral of the story, weigh up the pros and cons of telling people what gun you have.', ''),

All four inch barrel revolvers do not give lower velocities than all six in barrel revolvers regardless of make. There are many factors like bore and chamber dimensions, barrel cylinder gap the dimensions of the forcing cone the smoothness of the barrel etc. Which have to be taken into account.\n\nIf you were to take a revolver or a pistol with  an 8 inch barrel and you kept cutting two inches and chronographing with the same ammo , with every loss of barrel length the velocity will go down as all factors are the same\n\nNow if you take two pistols /revolvers of the same make with different barrel lengths and you chronograph them with same ammo there are chances you will be in for a surprise. I have a glock 19 which gives a higher velocity average than my 17 with a half inch longer barrel.\n\nIt is an established fact that other factors are also important. How ever a four inch barrel will be  much faster than a two inch  as for every caliber and pistol/Rifle an optimum length has to be there.

Muzzle velocity per se is not the only determinant of trajectory, down range velocity and retained energy, and for that, you must factor in projectile mass, ballistic co-efficient and sectional density, at the very least.

(41779, ' There is one more important thing that seems to have been missed which is the lateral spin imparted on the bullet as it leaves the muzzle. The more is the barrel length the more is the imparted spin and consequently there are more turns per unit time the bullet will be revolving with. The more speed with which the bullet spins, the more difficult it is to force it to divert from its initial intended path. This is just like spinning a top, you rotate it fast and disturb it, it will come back to its orignal spinning position. If you rotate is a bit slow it will come back after taking some more time. This is why when rotated faster with longer barrels, bullets tend to overcome factors like cross wind and travelling through air with different densities. The bullet is suppose to divert a little when entering from air of lower density to higher and vice versa.\nThis is why guns with longer barrrels are more accurate ... there are other factors too but it is a major contributing factor...\n\nRegards\n\nBloodBath', ''),

Development of a completely new weapon either a pistol or a rifle is a lengthy and costly exercise and specially for the company that dosent have its own patents. Reverse enginering dosent help in capturing lucrative export markets and production of things at the same quality level of the orgional at small scale is not a cheap option either. Look at the weastern handguns in US and EU markets, all top brands retail around 600$, this is cheap for the quality.

This is covered by  Ballistic Coefficient as pointed out by a worthy member already. A 160 grain bullet of 7mm will have a higher  BC than a 7mm bullet of 140 grains provided these are of exact same shape. A pointed or Spitzer bullet with a Boat tail will have a much higher BC than a bullet of same Cal  and Wt  & a round nose  flat base bullet.\n\nTrajectory is improved by higher velocities and higher BC. \n\nA light bullet from any Cal with low BC, even though it will start  faster at the muzzle; will be going slower than a bullet with a higher BC & Wt (same Cal ) which started a bit slower at ranges of 2 to 300 yds and .\nTherefore a higher velocity and higher BC will give us  relatively flatter trajectory.', ''),

Don''t know about barrel damage. Honestly, I would pass over local pellets even if I got them for free. So, no to local pellets. \n\nInternational Arms is in the same line as Haris Traders, just a bit further down the street. Good prices, me and my father have bought all our air rifles and pellets from there. Usually gives a discount if you buy a number of pellet tins. \n\nRs. 1200 per 500 translates to Rs. 600 per tin of 250 pellets, which I feel is overkill, unless the prices really rose since I last got my pellet supply. Were these British pellets flat-head, round head or pointed?\n\n(The following only relates to .22 pellets)\nI''ve been shooting nothing but Gamo MATCH and Gamo PRO MAGNUM through my Shadow 1000 since I got it last year. Have fired ~1000-1500 and they perform flawlessly. The MATCH is flat head, the PRO MAGNUM is a jacketed, pointy pellet. PRO MAGNUMS usually cost around Rs. 100 more than MATCH per tin. They have greater penetration as well. Btw, Gamo is a Spanish brand.\n\nIf you have the budget, don''t go for local, and consider Gamo pellets instead. RWS (Diana) pellets are also available, but they are on the more expensive side.\n\nAnyway, if you don''t mind, which air guns do you use?', ''),

The year of manufacture and the markings are not legible. The POF Rds are made of anealed steel with copper wash, both bullet and case can be checked with a magnet, these will stick to the magnet. \nI have not tried on the fake ammo but I think these are likely to be copper jacketed bullet and brass case.\nThe fake rds are low velocity and give a sulphurous on firing. I fired a batch of 50 such rds and they do tend to have failure to eject, and smoke stack jamms where the case sticks facing vertically upwards. The bullets when fired on steel plates just flattend, where as the POF rarely causes a stoppage and  shows considerable expansion despite being harder (steel jacket ).', ''),

In your friend''s case, th guy who nicked the side-view mirror must have stopped at a relatively isolated part of the road. Isolated areas, by default, should arouse your suspicions and put you on high alert. The very first thing should do is to keep checking your rear-view mirror constantly every 15-30 seconds or so.

The .30 will have less impact and will most likely go right though the person and if it hits a bone it will spin inside the body causing at most times unrepairable damage.

(42919, ' [b]How to make a fire[/b]\n\nSeveral needs\n\nA fire can fulfill several needs. It can keep you warm and dry. You can use it to cook food, purify water and to sterilize bandages. It can scare away dangerous animals and its smoke can keep flying insects at bay. It is also an important way to signal for help.\n\n\nFireplace\n\nBefore you can begin to build your fire, select your fire location. Select it with care, a good fire location is important. First choose a site that is sheltered and protected from the wind and has a supply of wood or other fuel available. \n\nThere should be nothing nearby that could catch fire, such as dry vegetation. Make sure your fire doesn''t get out of control. Safety is an essential consideration. Clear any debris away and start the fire on solid ground or on a layer of stones or on a flat shale rock. This will eliminate the possibility of a ground fire and leave no trace of the fire on the ground, except soot stones. \n\n\nFire material\n\nTo make a fire, you need to build it up gradually, beginning with small pieces of wood, then progressing to larger pieces as the fire gets going. You can grade your fire material intotinder, kindling, and fuel.\n\n\nTinder\n\nYou will need some material that ignites very easily to start a fire. Good tinder is dry material that takes only a spark to ignite. The tinder must be absolutely dry. There are a number of things you can use for tinder, paper, leaves, grass, bark and resin. You will find resin in spruce and pine trees. Resin will burn even if it is wet.\n\nUse your knife to turn dry sticks and pieces of bark into powdery tinder. Tinder is the most important part of your fire, so prepare it well. If you have found resin, rub it on small twigs and sticks. Have plenty of tinder on hand so your fire will not go out. Collect tinder before you need it. Put tinder in your pocket or backpack, so you always have it handy.\n\nLearn how to light a fire with matches, or to be more precise, light your tinder. Alternatively, why not learn how to make a fire with a flint striker.\n\n\nKindling\n\nKindling is readily combustible material that you add to the burning tinder. Small dry twigs and sticks are best. They should easily light when placed on a small flame. The dead branches on the undersides of trees provide excellent kindling, and they are usually dry, even if it has rained for weeks.\n\n\nFuel\n\nOnce your fire is established, you can add larger pieces offirewood. Make sure your firewood is as dry as possible. Look for dead trees, they are usually a good source of dry firewood.\n\n\nRemember\n\nNever leave a campfire unattended. Make sure your fire is completely out before leaving camp. Check it at least twice.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6743/36840059.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqbqYrJ][img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/8521/10102308.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqbr4W9][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/8889/57559142.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV16_tO0][img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/7196/99660933.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqbr9Vr][img]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/1290/20513452.th.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

Since then it is used by almost all armies of the world as the number one choice for Sub Machine Guns and Machine Pistols, and pistols.\nin 1985 it was adopted by the US Army, this a tribute to a cartridge which is now 107 years old and still the most popular military round all over the world.\nIt is a compact and balanced round, most powerful for its small size. There are a large number of derivatives of this cartridge, the 9mm Kurz (short), 9x18, 9x21, 9mm Bergmmann-Bayard, 9mm Browning Long, 9mm Steyr and several others.It uses 90, 100, 115,124 and 147 gr bullets at velocities from 1650 to 1080 ft/sec. Muzzle energies upto 480 ft/lbs\n\nThe 7.63x 25 Mauser was developed by Hugo Borchardt an American, and introduced in 1893, in the Borchardt pistol.\nIn 1896 the round was adopted by Paul Mauser for his famous Mauser pistol, side arm of the German Army.\n \nIn 1930 it was adopted by the Russians in the Tulla Tokerave or the TT30,  and they called it the 7.62x 25; both the German and the Russian round are interchangeable.\nBullet weights are 76, 86, 93 and a 100grains velocities are 100 to 1410 ft/sec and energies are upto 375 ft/lbs.\nThe TT 30 had steel core bullets which penetrated the soft armour of the level 3A bullet proof jackets and over penetrated in in all materials principally due to the steel core and no other reason. \nPresently most manufacturers are not making the steel core round. It even had Tracer Rounds for Tactical uses.\n\nThe Russians having realized some of the short commings came out with the 9mm Makarove actually a .366 inch bullet as compared to the .355 in of the 9mm.\nThe 9mm is by far superior to the 30.

(43094, ' comparison of 7.62x25 and 9mm is very popular and rational as both are the most popular cartridges of semi auto handguns of two different worlds(although 7.62x25 has lost its luster).\nAbbas and skeeter60 have given justice to the topic. I will just add or repeat few things.\n\nFirstly, atleast on paper both cartridges have very compareable energy or hitting force that is from 400 J to 700 J. In this field none has any advantage.\n\nSecondly, 7.62x25 has more velocity as compared to 9mm due to bottlenecked case and lighter projectile. 7.62x25 has velocity from 1400ft/sec upto 1700ft/sec and 9mm has velocity from 1100ft/sec upto 1400. This results in a quicker hit by 7.62x25 and greater range.\n\nThirdly, 7.62x25 has a greater panitration as compared to 9mm due to sleaker, faster and harder projectile. 7.62x25 has a projectile from 85 to 90 grains on the other hand 9mm has projectiles ranging from 115 to 147 grains.\n\nFinally, the overall killing capability. Ooooooomm, in this field 9mm has better capability due to following reasons. 9mm''s heavier projectile delivers full hitting force on the body of the subject by staying in the body and creates bigger wound cavity while a 7.62x25 prjectile mostly take some energy with it by passing through the body. Its sleeker and lighter projectile create smaller wound cavity.', ''),

Ideally, you should try all different brands of pellets available shoot them over varying distances to check for group size and drop, and the choose the brand with the minimum variation in both parameters.  However, the situation here in Pakistan is far from ideal, so just stick to domed pellets, and take a about ten random samples of every brand available , and weigh them on a jeweller''s electromic scale, and select te brand with the least variation. Stay away from heavy pellets like the H&N Barracuda for non-magnum spring powered guns. They will make short work of spring and piston seals.', ''),

(43221, ' [b]Building a survival shelter[/b]\nBuilding a survival shelter is an absolute priority, if you face a survival situation in harsh or unpredictable weather. A good shelter must protect you from the elements and be comfortable enough for resting and sleeping. Most people cannot survive unprotected from rough weather for more than a few hours. \n\n[b]Shelter site[/b]\n\nIf possible choose ground:\n\n- that is dry, well drained and reasonably flat.\n\n- that is a comfortable distance to water and has a supply of firewood.\n\n- that has building materials for your shelter.\n\n- that provides protection against strong winds.\n\nIf you are lost and people are looking for you, make sure your shelter site is easy to be seen and found by search and rescue teams.\n\n[u][b]Unsuitable shelter sites:[/b][/u]\n\n- A site too close to water may lead you to be troubled by insects.\n\n- Rivers presents a constant threat to safety. Heavy rainfall in nearby hills can easily create flash floods. Avoid dry riverbeds.\n\n- Avoid loose rocks, dead trees or other natural growth that could fall on your shelter.\n\n- Low ground, such as ravines and narrow valleys, couldbe damp and collect the heavy cold air at night and are therefore be colder than the surrounding high ground. On the other hand, the tops of mountains are exposed to higher winds. The best area to seek shelter is somewhere in between.\n\n[b]Survival shelters[/b]\n\nIf you have added a shelter tarp, an emergency blanket or an extra poncho to your gear, you are almost done with your shelter building. However, if you lack equipment, local conditions and materials will determine the type of wilderness shelter you build.\n\n[b]Natural cover[/b]\n\nLook for natural formations that could provide shelter. Examples include caves, rocky crevices and large trees with low-hanging limbs. If no natural formation is available to provide shelter, you will need to build your own.\n\n[b]Shelters made of natural materials[/b]\n\nMake your shelter just large enough to accommodate you, especially in cold climates, because you are going to have to heat it. One of the best wilderness shelters is called the "debris hut". When shelter is essential to survival, if possible, build this survival shelter.\n\nIf you do not want to spend too much time and effort to build your shelter. Probably, the quickest type of wilderness shelter to build is the lean-to shelter.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/7230/44134312.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5527/27962900.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/3796/91359396.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

I started searching for that particular teetar & suddenly a big boar showed me his ugly face from the bush.I was holding my steven Double barell with one 6 Number cartrage inside the 2ng barell as one was fired already on the teetar.I dindt loose my patience & was in intention not to disturb the boar.But it suddenly attacked me (started running towards me) In a fraction of second I throw my shot gun & pulled out the mauser from holster (as one can see in my previous threads, i always keep the hand gun with me in any types of shikar, even on duck shoots) it was already loaded just removed the safety & Boar was about 6 feet distance.Big bang & the powerful .30 Chinese bullet was away from the barell & hit the head of Big Boar.Bulls eye , a fountain of blood blasted from his eye/head & than the second bang hit the fore head, than third on his moth. Boar fell in my feet & was dead. I was sweat even in chilling weather of December.\nMy uncle Col.Ikram, My Nephew Faizan, Raja Saqib & other team members rushed towards the scene as they hear 3 consecutive pistol shots.

Skeeter60 is the most suitable person to answer this question.[/quote]\n\nDrilling a hole in the 7.62x25 will only render it weaker as the 76 grain rd will be reduced to about 65 grains or so (only a guess- timate) reducing the muzzle energy.\n\nThere is a whole technology that  is involved in making the bullets expand/mushroom without breaking or losing weight. Will discuss  that later.\n\nThe 7.62 rd will not expand as it is steel jacketed, (90 % of the time ) I know some of you will jump at this. Please check it out with a magnet. The Jacket is copper washed steel and most of the rds (older) are steel core.\n\nNow the hazard. If you drill a hole in the front part of the bullet there is a very real danger of the core slipping out of the jacket and the jacket stays in the barrel. The next round one fires and you guessed right ----    K BOOM .\n\nIf you study the FMJ bullets they have an open base from where the core is inserted and pressed home. When the nose is removed the Core can and will shoot out at least a fair number of times out of 10. When I was younger I had this happen to me when I tried to convert  a 30-06 military rd into a soft point , luckily I did not fire the second shot as I heard prolonged hissing after the shot.

Power wise its also very modestly moderate and on the edge of being not too much and not too less. Just appropriate and enough for the task. Small size leads to greater magazine capacity thus more firepower and hit chances.\n9 is better in all ways if SD is kept in mind, and its even more acceptable than .45 in a longer run due to its versatality(though this requires a huge debate in itself)', ''),

There are a lot of compromises to be made in view of conflicting requirements.\nNothing stops an evil threat faster than a shotgun loaded with BB or AAA at ranges under thirty yards. Can one walk around  the house all the time with a loaded shotgun ?\nA S&W 500, or a .44magmum again has similar problems of carrying. I wonder if some one has fired a 44mag in side a room without ear muffs, it will disorientate the shooter himself a bit.\nA medium sized pistol in a good holster can be carried all day in the house where as the shot gun or MP or your favorite assault rifle will be safely tucked up where you can not reach immediately. The only weapon one can use is the one which one is carrying unless the evil threat give you a warning. It is probable the warning will not come.\nNow a 9mm is popular for a large number of reasons for the last 107 years, it is adequate power wise and available in a number of grades a and  choices. \nThe ammo available in the market is  Silver tip HP, The Hydra shock, and Geco FMJ, The POF FMJ , the chinese ,all are adequate . Only please ensure you are getting the original stuff and not the No 2 type. Train hard and reduce the time you take to draw , chamber and fire. Practice drawing and firing at a target 3 yds away in One Second,  then drawing and firing at three targets, 7 yds away, two rds each in less than 4 seconds .\nA trained shooter far outways the advantages or disadvantages of any caliber or gun.\nWord of warning when ever re- holstering a Glock , make sure your trigger finger is out of the trigger guard  and not resting on the trigger. There have been accidents. The most  prominent Accidental Discharge (AD) was on board the US one ,the presidents Jumbo in which a colonel from the special forces accidently discharged his glock while re-holstering.\nTrain hard and carry your SD gun a gun lying upstairs in a locked cupboard is no good', ''),

(43734, ' [quote=R Shahreyar]Whats the effective rane of .22 GSG-5 and current price of a .22 bullet ?[/quote]\n\nEffective Range is a product of multiple factors including some of the following:\n\n1. Length of barrel - the longest = the furthest, which is why rifles are capable of greater range with same caliber loads.\n\n2. Load Type - .22 loads are available in a variety of loads viz a viz., High Velocity, Hollow Points, Sub-sonic, Super-sonic, Lead and Copper-plated. All these have a bearing on the muzzle velocity you achieve as well as the energy on impact. There is a trade-off between velocity and energy on impact ofcourse. Explanation: Hollow-points have higher energy on impact i.e., stopping power i.e., the bullet expands on impact whereas, the round-points simply go through. Which in other words means, that there is direct correlation between velocity and range.\n\nThe load type is also very important from another aspect. A High velocity bullet experiences breaking sound barrier two times - firstly soon after it leaves the muzzle and another when it decelerates below 1000 fps and at both these times, the bullet changes its course. That is why, if your target is around 100 yards away, it is suggested that to get accuracy, you do not use High-Velocity or Super-sonic rounds. Standard, copper-plated loads would do fine. \n\n.22 caliber is known to have reached over 800 yards easily, but if you are asking of LETHAL range, then it is generally believed that depending on your placement, a .22 caliber can be lethal till 130-150 yards if shot from a rifle, 100 yards if from carbine and 50 yards if from a pistol.\n\n\n\nThis article below written by someone who has significantly more knowledge about Effective Range of .22 Caliber will explain further. This guy achieved 300 yards using a rifle:\n\n[url]http://www.snipershide.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=504301&fpart=1[/url]\n\n\nTherefore, it depends on which GSG 5 you are going for. The GSG 5 comes in three variants - Rifle, Pistol and Compact Pistol. Mind you, the Pistol version has a barrel length longer than most pistols, so the lethal range would be near to carbine i.e., 100 yards or 300 feet.\n\n\nSenior members are requested to correct me where necessary.\n\n\nFOR PRICES: I would myself like to know the rates of following .22 loads:\n\n1. CCI Minimags HV\n\n2. Aguila Interceptor 40 grain\n\n3. Remington Viper\n\n4. Winchester HV SuperX\n\n5. CCI Segmented HP HV\n\n6. Winchester HP SuperX\n\nAnyone of Price ?', ''),

The Zionists control who goes in and who comes out of the Masjid, sometimes they seal it off and do not allow any Muslims to pray there.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a bayan by an English speaking alim on the subject of Masjid al Aqsa it is in 2 parts.\n\n[b]Part 1[/b] \n\n[url]http://hamzajennings.com//wp-content/downloads/mp3/Haq/Masjid%20Al-Aqsa%20in%20Danger/Masjid%20Al%20-%20Aqsa%20In%20Danger1.mp3[/url]\n\n\n[b]Part 2[/b]  The sound quality of this second part is poor \n\n[url]http://hamzajennings.com//wp-content/downloads/mp3/Haq/Masjid%20Al-Aqsa%20in%20Danger/Masjid%20Al%20-%20Aqsa%20In%20Danger2.mp3[/url]', ''),

(43993, ' Milbro Caledonian is a good brand. I have shot them and I like them.  There was a query about  pellets being good out to 50 meters, and there was also a chart posted by a member showing muzzle velocity for different pellets. \n\nTher are a few things I would like to point out here. Firstly, 50 metres is usually extreme range for most spring powered (low and medium powered airguns). I would not attempt shooting birds at 50 metres with a Chinese or local airgun, as the pellet would not have enough power to kill humanely at that range. \n\nPlease keep in mind that to shoot accurately and kill cleanly, and to do both with consistency, at ranges beyond 30 metres, you need a powerful gun (at least 16lbfts at the muzzle), and you need a relatively mid-weight to heavy weight pellet. Light weight pellets decelarate quite quickly and do not retain enough energy to make a clean kill. Furthermore,they are also more prone to wind deflection than their heavier cousins.\n\nHaving said that, I would also likem to emphasise, that in airguns, the gun itself, and not the pellet is the powerplant, so be very careful, when you read velocity and energy tables for pellets. Always ask what gun was used to generate this data.', ''),

If you are already a hunter, reloading is not an issue and you will be more familiar with the weapon already.

(whole scheme is quiet similar to Baikal of Russia, since China to some extent still operates as the old communist USSR).\n\nNorinco used to buy CF98 from this company under the designation Norinco NP42 and Norinco CF98 (two versions for export diversification, otherwise absolutely same thing), stamp their logo on it and export it (similar to Baikal, its just an export name). however after the imposition of export embargo on Norinco (its name popped up in an illegal arms deal), many export oriented companies were created (on similar setup such as norinco and baikal) to work around the embargo and Entercon was one of them. just like norinco, its just an export name. the company (CHANG-FENG MACHINE MANUFACTURING) that designed the CF98 is still the only company engaged in its production.\n\nRegards', ''),

And how is always dependedent on the totality of the circumstances.  What is judged best in one situation can easily be determined wrong in another situation which has changed only slightly.  I believe it best to judge the correctness of an action based on facts known, not possibilities unknown.  \n\nI personally believe just walking away is always the wrong thing to do.  But, drawing your gun and turning the situation into a gun fight is not always the correct thing to do.\n\nBetween those two ends are a lot of options; calling the police and being a good witness.  Taking photographs with a cellphone, etc.\n\nBut we have a saying in Texas... "Some people just need killin''."  And we call a coward a coward.

(44139, ' Paper cartridge refers to one of various types of small arms ammunition used before the advent of the metallic cartridge. These cartridges consisted of a paper cylinder or cone containing the bullet, gunpowder, and, in some cases, a primer or a lubricating and anti-fouling agent. The term combustible cartridges is applied to those paper cartridges that use paper treated with oxidizers to allow them to burn completely upon ignition.\nPaper cartridges were often coated in beeswax, lard, or tallow, which served a number of purposes. It provided some degree of water resistance, it lubricated the paper-wrapped bullet as it was pushed down the bore, and it melted upon firing to mix with the powder residue and make the resulting fouling easier to remove. Since the standard procedure for loading a musket or rifled musket involved biting open the cartridge, this can cause problems for those with strict dietary restrictions. The Sepoy soldiers in the employ of the British in India, for example, were largely Hindu, who were forbidden to eat beef, or Muslim, who were forbidden to eat pork. Rumors of the use of lard and tallow in the lubrication of the cartridges they were using were part of the cause of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.', ''),

WHat was Santa anna thinkin.. takin on the Alamo on my B day\n\nOn a more serious not.. I know bout a lot of people who were shot dead by armed robbers. without a conscience.. Saw it happen in front of me.. a handsome young man in his early 20s.. lying in a pool of blood.. I have never resisted armed assailants myself.[/quote]\n\nLet us not forget that the Texans actually lost at the Alamo.  They may have fought to the death, but they all died.\n\nConcerning the seriousness of the subject; death is a very real, very possible result when we choose to act in a robbery, kidnapping, or murder.  We should start, if we do start, with the expectation that we will win; envisioning the best possible outcome.  Positive thinking tends to lead to positive results.  However, we would be mentally ill if we did not recognize that things can go bad very quickly.\n\nNot all men are equipped to physically resist an attacker.  It may be that the attacker is simply too much larger, stronger and younger than the victim.  It could be the result of age or infirmary.  This the very reason some carry guns- to give themselves the means to defend themselves against young helathy thugs.\n\n@KageFox:  I understand what the quote is alluding to, but I prefer, "the only way to stop a killer is to be a better killer."  Personally I don''t want to adopt the moniker, "monster." (I know you didn''t attempt to label anyone that way, it was intelletual discussion)  \n\nI maintain my humanity when I act "inhumanely" (killing, even viciously killing another) in the pursuit or saving an innocent, even if that innocent is me.  I am willing to be a better killer than the amateur killer before me.  Once I am done destroying him, I will continue to be the non-monster I am.  I will remain law-abiding, home-providing, loving-husband, parenting-father that I am.  \n\nI think that your quote correctly identifies the need to be more vicious than the robber.  It reminds me of a line from "The Untouchables," with Sean Connery and Kevin Costner, "If he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.  If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue."  \n\nWhat I observed in the videos were robbers who threatened but appeared unwilling to harm.  I can''t say for sure, there may be cultural differences at play, but when some flashes a gun and then tucks it away I do not believe they are as committed to doing me harm as the thug who keeps the gun pointed at me.  I believe that universal.  The person who is unwilling to do harm at the drop of hat is at a disadvantage to the person who is.  \n\nLikewise, the person who is willing to be more vicious (gouge out an ear, bite off a nose, slam a head into the wall with both hands), has the advantage over the man who will not.\n\nI read a thread elsewhere which referenced, "your gun is not a talisman, it does not ward off evil.  Nor is like a cross to vampires- just because you display it doesn''t mean they will flee back into the night.  It is a tool, it only works if you know how to use, are willing to use it, and finally- use it well."  That author was correct.\n\nWe had a scrappy little martial artists on the Sheriff''s department where I was a deputy.  He was a bad-ass jujitsuist.  If you fought his fight, you lost.  One day we were sparring and when he went for my legs I struck him down to the ground with blows to the upper back and mimicked a kick to his head.  It would have ended the bout.  He may not have truly gone for my legs in a real LE encounter, but maybe he would have.  The lesson was understood by all including him.  He may have had great trainging and skill, but simply, "I ain''t playing this game," shove to the ground followed by a vicious kick to the head with steel toed boots and all that skill did not matter.  \n\nWill matters.', ''),

How to defend your point that they were actually BGs. What if when you hit one of them get badly injured or even killed and his partner take the weapon and runaway and when the police inspect the spot no weapon would be found.\n\n\nFor situation at home the practical thing is always not what we plan. If the offender is loaded and he come to know that everyone is alarmed then due to the confuse and panicky situation maybe he don''t wait for your warning and start firing and this can happen that he get the fires on you so is it not better to take action first rather then waiting for the humble response of the offender.

A more sporting shoot is to give the bird a chance...it should be flying shots. Hunting off a jeep with a shot gun for birds (say sand grouse, partridges etc) is kind of un sportsmanlike--in local parlance they call it jeeping.\n\nYou should try getting sand grouse early morning or late evening when they are flying into their water hole---you strategically place the morchas around the water hole--wait for the birds to come in and get your shot. they come in at amzing speeds making the shoot tougher. Onc they are on the ground the birds are safe and no shots allowed. Give it a try if you haven already shot snd grouse in the same way--i guarantee a better thrill!', ''),

If it is possible and feasible, I''ll shoot at the BGs when they are making an exit from the crime scene. Easier for the police to identify a car with bullet holes in its windshield or a bleeding person.\n\n- If it''s a woman''s honour, then I''d be taking head shots and groin shots after first getting myself at a vantage point.\n\n- If burglars have entered my neighbour''s house and I become aware of it, as was the case last year, I would simply start shooting in the air whilst call the police and inform them. I''ll make sure the guy sitting at 15 hears a few shots that I''m firing. I''ll continue firing till the time police get to the scene. This is precisely what was done by me last year. Result: The dacoits fled before the police could arrive. Were only able to take some gold and cash worth a few hundred thousand. They were not allowed to stay for a longer time. The honour of women remained safe, Alhamdolillah.\n\nI know I''d be risking my life while doing this. But then its my life....... hence, my decision.\n\nIf I manage to kill the BG(s), then I''ll consider my options, viz a viz., \n\nVanish \n\nOR \n\nGo to the dead BG, pick his gun, fire a few shots from his gun towards where I was standing and then claim self defence\n\nOR\n\nWait for the police to arrive, if I have friendly witnesses on hand.', ''),

A more sporting shoot is to give the bird a chance...it should be flying shots. Hunting off a jeep with a shot gun for birds (say sand grouse, partridges etc) is kind of un sportsmanlike--in local parlance they call it jeeping.\n\nYou should try getting sand grouse early morning or late evening when they are flying into their water hole---you strategically place the morchas around the water hole--wait for the birds to come in and get your shot. they come in at amzing speeds making the shoot tougher. Onc they are on the ground the birds are safe and no shots allowed. Give it a try if you haven already shot sand grouse in the same way--i guarantee a better thrill![/quote]\n\nNazeer i myself dont like to shoot a bird which can fly but for every hunting bird, hunting is done in some specific style so the place i do my sandgrouse hunting we have to first fire on  a sitting sandgrouse on the ground and when they start flying as a flok u can get as many shots as u want and almost 85 percent of the birds were shot while flying.\nwhen i do my hunting i follow all the norms of hunting.\nregards imu10', ''),

(381210, ' @Trajan\nBro I completely agree with your assessment of the current traffic situation; most of the times it''s next to impossible to predict just what the hell the driver/rider of an erratic vehicle is thinking. However, the bikes situation I described can only be implemented when the bike (or bikes) stop in front of you, completely blocks your path and the rider dismounts. Since this situation will most probably be happening in an open, low-population area, I think it''s safe to assume that you''re facing a BG. In this particular scenario (bike blocks my path in an empty area, rider dismounts and starts to walk towards me), I''ll immediately gun the engine, and if I run the bastard over then all the better.\n\nAs for your comments on the HD situation, yes I agree that the logical step would be to bunker down and call for back up. The reason I advocate a more pro-active approach is simply because it''s usually the last thing a BG expects, and that element of surprise goes a long way in evening the odds. About 10 years back 3 men sneaked into our house in the middle of the night. My father heard a slight noise, pulled out his weapon (an old Webley .38 revolver) and proceeded to shoot them. Two of the BG''s were hit but only one of them was caught. Yes, it''s a [B]VERY[/B] dangerous tactic and things could have gotten [B]VERY[/B] hairy, but I strongly believe that no man has the right violate the sanctity of my home or threaten to harm my loved ones. I am a gun advocate because I believe that each and everyone of us has the right to protect ourselves (with extreme prejudice, if necessary); if some motherf****r (pardon the language) thinks he can simply walk into my house and do as he pleases then I''ll be more than happy to show him the error of his ways.\n\nI guess it all comes down to what we individually consider as an acceptable response in a given situation; if I''m alone at home then I won''t hesitate to take the fight to the BG''s, but with family at home then I''ll most probably bunker down and call for back up. The most important things to remember in a HD scenario is to know the layout of your house intimately (you should be able to move from to room and navigate around furniture in complete darkness), to stay as calm as possible, and to be ready to use your weapon without hesitation if the need arises.', ''),

The collection of milk is done from certain points and you will be surprised to know that, same point is used by almost all of the companies. I mayslef have found starch at the bttom of Haleeb Pack and if you guys can see the process through which that milk is collected and stored at those collection points, you will never ever want to drink it again. I was pro Tetra Pack until i started to get upset stomach every time i drank Nestle, Olpers or Haleeb. I stopped drinking milk due to this issue as i thought i got Lactose tolerancy issues. A friend of mine once took me to his farm and their i had the chance to drink pure milk. Guess what, no issues since that day. Now i dont even look at the milk by any such companies. People are turning to Tetara Pack as pure milk is no longer available in market anymore but it can be found if one tries hard.\nThere are somethings which i have noticed with Tetra Pack milk and i think KK will agree on these. First, if you drop pure milk, there will be smell but it will subside in a day or at most day and a half. Tetra Pack drop will take you around 3 to 5 days and the smell is nasty. Secondly, if you leave pure milk in open, no maggots are prduced while its a speciality with tetra pack milk.\n\nAlso one more thing is that, we have bashed so much that Mr. TT has stopped posting on his own topic so please take it easy guys.', ''),

A specie that was NOT banned two years ago (like surkhab, barheaded goose etc) here in Punjab and pics posted about those in that period are entirely within the legal ambit and no cause for worries for anybody, at forum or outside. Besides, personally speaking, I don''t take these things very seriously --- I consider more serious issues like [B]netting [/B](please see video ... [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PQZhbJzdQ&feature=related[/url] ... as it is now very common and the main cause of worry), [B]pesticides [/B](as they have wiped partridge populations also), [B]habitat [/B](bela in case of partridge & water/wetlands in case of waterfowl) & [B]localized poaching [/B](with different methods of both waterfowl & partridge), to be of much more magnitude first. Frankly speaking, we as sport loving people are naturally inclined to be worried about the game''s future, and genuine shotgunning on gamebirds does very minimal damage as compared to major hazards mentioned above.\r\n\r\nBut, these updates on Wildlife Act come every year; the amendment in THE ACT was only made in 2007 October which I pasted; after that every year different updates vide notifications about hares, pigeons, doves etc have come from time to time, and changed yearly as per ground figures of wildlife (if I am not wrong). IT WOULD BE A NICE IDEA IF THIS THREAD IS USED TO INFO ABOUT LATEST UPDATES (OR AMENDMENTS IF ANY) FROM TIME TO TIME TO KEEP ALL MEMBERS INFORMED.\r\n\r\nYou see, there is a much different trend in the last few years. Local people have started poaching excessively with baits/nets/lures for meat or illegal trade. And the onus of that has fallen on shikaris which is definitely not just. That gets reflected in these wildlife act amendments and updates too. I think the whole system needs re-thinking. Pls correct me if I am wrong.[/quote]', ''),

An adult can survive only a few days without water, but many weeks without food.\n\n[b]Dehydration[/b]\n\nAbout 3/4 of the human body is water. Your body loses 0.5-1 gallon (2-3 liters) of water each day through sweating and urination, more if you are hot, exerting a lot of energy or are at high altitudes. This water must be replaced. Therefore, drink often.\n\nFinding water is critical, if not, dehydration will inevitably occur. The symptoms you will face are thirst, weakness, decreased mental capacity, nausea, no appetite and dark colored urine. \n\nTo prevent water loss, rest, keep cool, stay in the shade, and seek shelter. Do not wait until you run out of water before you look for more. Your body doesn''t only get water from drinking water. Lots of foods contain water, good examples are fruit and vegetables, and any non-water fluid. However, avoid fatty foods, caffeinated beverages and alcohol as they trigger digestion to use up the fluids.\n\n[u][b]Waterborne contaminants[/b][/u]\n\nIn most parts of the world, surface water is seldom pure. There are five basic waterborne contaminants: turbidity, toxic chemicals, bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms.\n\nTurbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of the water. Dangerous and toxic chemicals include, among others, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers from agricultural land. Bacteria and viruses can cause very serious illnesses, such as diarrhea and dysentery.\n\nA common parasite is Giardia lamblia. It is found worldwide and within every region of the United States and has become recognized as one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases. Giardia lamblia causes diarrhea, which leads to dehydration.\n\n[b]Water purification[/b]\n\nThere are three ways to treat suspected water: filtration, boiling and chemical waterpurification. \n\n· Filtering water doesn''t purify it, but it reduces particles and sediment and makes the water taste better. Learn how to make a water filter.\n\n· Boiling is the most certain way of killing all microorganisms. However, boiling will NOT neutralize chemical pollutants. \n\n· To purify water with chemicals, use water purification tablets that should be included in your survival kit.\n\n\nPurification filters\n\nThere are microbial purification filters available that not only removes parasites as Giardia, but also kill waterborne bacteria and viruses. This type of water purifier filter makes your water even safer.', ''),

(44563, ' @Abu Hafs - what might be a reasonable apprehension? hmm good piont. lets talk a little on it and try to figure it out. a reasonalbe apprehension will not be same in different situations. that is for sure, (So the question is how does the law define reasonable apprehension of death/serious injury?)  law does not define it, law has no standard for it, its upto you! a reasonalbe apprehension is something what you feel in that very moment. its a sense of danger, sense of getting assaulted, robbed or tortured in physical way,  it is you who will xplain later and convince them that i felt a reasonable apprehension of being assaulted which may have cause death if succeeded otherwise. or maybe i would have got robbed if i havnt  re-act. not necessary to see a gun in intruders''s hand. an intruder can or may slaughter you with a knife worthing 20 ruppees.  we cant define the exact measure for a strong apprehension. the very strong point you got is that  (1) intruder is found  dead/injured/captured in your house, and for sure there is no GOOD reason for him to be here. (2) he has a gun, or knife, or any thing at all which may harm a human being if used voilently. (3) he has any tool which may be helpful to break a lock, rope to climb a wall, even pins which they use to open windows or door locks. anything at all which may help a person to get him in a house thru various techniques. see? 3 main things which will help you out thru investigations, intruder''s presence in your house, any thing which may be used as a weapon, any tool which may be used for night breaking.  any point from those 3 will help you out thru investigation,   one more thing i must mention here, its always good to give a warning and still if danger is felt, we have to do what we have to do. let me clarify please, we are not talking about definitely killing or injuring anyone, we are talking about defending our lives or property, our pride. giving a warning by screaming , firing off couple of shots in air or shooting straight to the intruder, everying thing comes in defence. Note: an ALARMING warn is usually  helpful. still if the threat exists, stop it by any means.', ''),

(44626, ' Barrel heating\n\nIn case of bolt action rifles if the barrel is too hot to touch , it  is too hot to shoot. Of course you can go on shooting with no damage apparently to the barrel from out side but the bore of the rifle barrel experiences erosion in the chamber throat ruining the accuracy of an otherwise fine rifle.\nIn the Military type ARs or  AKs you  do not have to worry much as the bores are chrome lined and resist erosion better than steel, also these are not in the accuracy category to lose much. One can go on blazing but should not be without any purpose. If one shoots deliberately and with a purpose  one can not over heat even an auto rifle barrel.\n\nOf course Machine guns used to have water cooling on both sides but with improved metallurgy and reduced dependence  on Machine gun fire and change ability of barrels the water cooling was done away with .\nAll Light  Machine Guns and Medium Machine Guns have spare barrels with them and being a crew served weapon it is the duty of the No 2 to change barrels with thick gloves to avoid burning hands, as the LMG and the MG barrels actually glow red at night. The barrels are changed as they get so hot the range and accuracy gets seriously effected. this occurs during a fire fight in operations not during training.  I want to add that in case of a fine hunting rifle it should not be fired repeatedly that is if you fire only three to four rounds of a 7mm Mag or a 300 mag   in one minute you must allow it to cool for about three minutes. These are precision weapons not meant for declaring a war, their accuracy will be ruined if these are fired more than ten times in two minutes. From minute of angle rifles these will turn into 3 0r 4 minute of  angle rifles even if mistreated like this once only.\n\nThe .308 or a 7x57 are slightly less sensitive the 270 is more sensitive due to smaller bore and bigger case volume.\n\nThe Machine guns are considered good if these can group inside 12 inches at a 100yds when fired single shot. \n\nIt is the ACCURACY which is ruined nothing else Please. In competition shooting the 308 win and 6mm are used  with bull barrels and heavier actions. Sometimes heavier cals are also used but the matches are slow fire, even the rapid events one fires 5 rds in 3 minutes and then a break for scoring which means the rifles  cool in between. \n\nA sniper will seldom fire more than two rds in a minute  unless in operations,  just to save his accuracy, even when fired in this slow manner the accuracy life of a sniper rifle barrel is just about 2500 rds, the 7mm Mag about 1000 rds the weatherby 270 under 500 rds. The 270 winchester 1200 to 1500 rds ( all depends on several factors like cleaning and breaking in and the ammo used). We are talking accuracy, otherwise these will keep shooting but loss of accuracy will increase rapidly.\n    \nIn case of shot guns while shooting quail sometimes the barrels do get  hot but there is no damage except discomfort on touching.In the trap event two rds are fired in half a second but then you wait for the other five shooters to take their turn before you shoot again.  A shotgun barrel cannot be damaged in any manner by continous shooting due to a very small amount of powder used and the pressure being six times less than that of a rifle , no rifling and little bore friction .\n\nThe rate or fire of anti aircraft guns and aircraft canon is  so high that even though they fire very short bursts  the barrels have to be changed  frequently  < these are changed for good>  The rate of fire is, by the way between 2000 to 6000 rds per minute these guns eat the barrels', ''),

However, he confirmed that all those licences which had been issued on the basis of fake bank receipts, forged signatures and fictitious stamps would be quashed forthwith after due investigations. \n\nAsked about the alleged involvement of three sections officers in the scam, Mr Mazari said since the NA committee was investigating the issue, he was not in position to give any official comment. \n\nSources close to investigations told Dawn that relentless efforts were being made to save the skin of some big players involved in the scam at the cost of ministry officials.', ''),

Which brand have they tortured enough to know about its reliability. Which brand fits their hand and makes them feel like it was built for their hand only.\nGuys please stop talking about theory and lets for once start a practical discussion.

I remember almost 10 years back, there was a break in at our home when we were out of the city, a lot of valuables were stolen. My father decided to get my grandfather''s old Webley .38 out of storage and to start using it as a HD weapon. Sure enough, hardly a week after the first burglary, the bloody thieves decided to try their luck again. This time, however, my father emptied the gun straight at them, all 6 rounds. Of the 3 thieves who had broken in, one was tapped in the shoulder (but managed to get away) and another one shot in leg (was caught and handed over to the police). Needless to say, that was the least time we had any unwanted nocturnal visitors! :-)\n\nOn a side note, up until that point I had a relatively low opinion of revolvers (especially those more than 40 years old).

However, I was once tipped by some lawyer friend that in a situation where the BG goes down with your shots, it''s better to disown it n report it as an accidental result of the shots fired by the BG''s accomplices who ran away when you made noise, after noticing their presence. He later referred to an incidence in our village, where the guy who had gunned down the BG in SD, had been acquitted by giving a similar statement. \nHowever I personally am not sure if it''s a good suggestion n also don''t know about its general applicability.

(381156, ' [QUOTE=cyanide.dipped;180945]Had a debate over the issue of Glock prices with a friend who is a Glock diehard. My argument was that the main attraction of a Glock pistol is it being cheap and being extremely durable at the same time. In PK though, Glocks are one of the most expensive handguns that you can buy and that''s just not worth it. The Glock 17, last time I checked, was being sold around 280k in LHR. That is insane. And I wouldn''t buy a Glock for that price ''cuz I know that Glocks are not worth that price. I would rather prefer buying a gun at the local market the price of which at least had a reasonable difference with its actual price in international market or in the country of its origin.\n \nWhat do you guys think? :)[/QUOTE]\n \nvery informative chat sir......finally some body made this heard......for this price I would rather buy a a collectable revolver or something.......but sadly as denovo sir has also mentioned the dealers will stamp out our enthusiasim when it comes to other brands by bringing their prices at par with the glocks and other high enders.........some one should really teach them the meaning of price control..........why isnt there any regulation when it comes to this I mean...sure they can earn decent profits but tha doesnt mean THAT YOU CAN RIP US OFF MAN...I mean thats the extreme...way above the abnormal profit line.....what brand would you gentlemen suggest as having the best bang for the buck so to speak.', ''),

It''s excellent sport, specially if you get them on passage in the evenings when they are flying from the fields to the roosts. \n\nDont give up shooting sandgrouse. However, in August one runs the risk of shooting females that are either on eggs, or then are rearing young. I have seen a female on eggs as late as mid-September. She refused to fly away, and then when we were about five yards away she flew off a short distance and sat down, and then I got off from the Jeep to go see the spot where she was sitting in the grass, and discovered her nest there.\n\nShooting on water holes is also unsporting I feel. It is certainly un-Islamic, ( you can read that in any book of fiqh). \n\nUltimately, how one hunts is largely dictated by one''s own beliefs, and in turn, also reflects one''s beliefs. Frankly, not all the laws in the world can have any meaningful impact, unless one''s own ethics are in agreement with them. This is not to say that one should bow to discriminatory laws, but that one should heed his conscience.', ''),

Unless you can speak up on game and shoot it at zero yards range, the 30-06 does a better job all the time.  It''s the world most popular centrefire calibre for hunting medium sized game, and placed well, a shot from a 30-06, can bring down large game too. For the four legged game we have here in Pakistan, the 30-06 is one caliber that does them all, and with consummate ease - whether it''s ibex, urial, hog deer, hog, markhor or bharal.\n\nFor more infomation check out this link:\n\n[url]http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_11_51/ai_n15402279/[/url]\n\n\nHappy Hunting.', ''),

It''s excellent sport, specially if you get them on passage in the evenings when they are flying from the fields to the roosts. \n\nDont give up shooting sandgrouse. However, in August one runs the risk of shooting females that are either on eggs, or then are rearing young. I have seen a female on eggs as late as mid-September. She refused to fly away, and then when we were about five yards away she flew off a short distance and sat down, and then I got off from the Jeep to go see the spot where she was sitting in the grass, and discovered her nest there.\n\nShooting on water holes is also unsporting I feel. It is certainly un-Islamic, ( you can read that in any book of fiqh). \n\nUltimately, how one hunts is largely dictated by one''s own beliefs, and in turn, also reflects one''s beliefs. Frankly, not all the laws in the world can have any meaningful impact, unless one''s own ethics are in agreement with them. This is not to say that one should bow to discriminatory laws, but that one should heed his conscience.[/quote]\n\n\nImu, you are the key and leading persons in our Pak guns in all the key matters, who can stop you  from hunting, (after all i would be looking  for few of your hunts once your deep freezers becomes overloaded.................. :)  and didn''t meant any offense , salman has made a valid point in the messages, as you have got a very good nishana  so no sand grouse,batair, partridge,taloor and ducks even at long range will have chance of survival when you are in action.', ''),

YOU will be facing PPC 324. \n\n        302 more mess - 324 little mess. \n\n   this is not the point, point is whether guy is dead or injured. you will have to  xplain, and trust me, you will have to xplain it real good so court of law becomes convinced, while on solid grounds, mentioning strong reason, if you control you senses after matter is done, court will give you some + points like presence of that guy in your house, any weapon existance or any night-breaking tools existance.  \n\n\n please let me clarify this again, shooting directly is the last option, consider the  restrictions of law mentioned in PPC 99 ( if there is time to contact authorities, or if there is no clear threat of life/injury etc)\n                                i say and i recommend it also, warnings, screaming alarms, firing in the air, getting neighbours help etc or calling police, usually and most oftenly helps. in very rare cases threat exists even after doing all this. good for everyone if we keep this killing/injuring ( in defence ) option as a BOTTOM LINE.', ''),

(45397, ' An air gun pellet is, for the most part, a non-spherical projectile designed to be fired from an air gun. But this is not always the case. Pellets differ from bullets used in firearms because of the pressures encountered; firearms operate at pressures of thousands of atmospheres, while airguns operate at pressures as low as 50 atmospheres. Firearms have sufficient pressure to force a slightly over-sized bullet to fit the bore in order to form a tight seal, while airguns generally use a slightly undersized projectile that is designed to obdurate upon shooting so as to seal the bore, and engage the rifling. Since pellets may be shot through a smoothbore barrel, they are often designed to be inherently stable.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/3847/98684236.jpg[/img]\n[/url]\n\nFrom left to right, flat, round nose, hollow point and pointed pellets.

For this you will have to invest in a small battery powered jewellers scales calibrated in milligrams or grains, (most have both scales built in). You can buy such a scale from the jewellery supplies market just up the street from Sarawan Hotel in Saddar. \n\nTo weigh the pellets, place the scale on a flat, firm and vibration free surface, and randomly pick 10 pellets of each type, and then proceed to weight them. The brand you shd buy is the one with the least weight variation. In The US, you can buy pellet samplers that contain about 20  pellets of about 20-30 different types, and with the aid of a chronograph and bench rest, you can fire 10 shot groups of each type of pellet, to check for grouping and velocity at a given range, say 20 yards or 30 yards. This is the ideal method. But in the absence of pellet samplers, chronographs and bench rests, the jeweller''s scale is our best bet.', ''),

(45491, ' [b][u]Exhibition shooting[/u][/b] or trick shooting is a sport in which a marksman performs various feats of skill, frequently using non-traditional targets. Exhibition shooting tends to stress both speed and accuracy, often with elements of danger added.\n\n[b][u]1) Annie Oakley[/u][/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/3664/77410779.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nWith the advent rifling came accurate firearms, and many exhibition shooters turned to these, forming the beginnings of western exhibition shooting. The most famous exhibition shooter is Annie Oakley, who toured with Buffalo Bill''s Wild West show. While she could shoot well with handguns, rifles, and shotguns, Oakley''s preferred firearm was a .22 caliber rifle. Standard tricks of Oakley''s included:\nCutting a playing card in half with a rifle bullet at long ranges \nShooting cigarettes in half while they were held by volunteers \nShooting a dime tossed in the air, at range of 90 feet \nShooting long strings of targets tossed in the air; in one instance she hit 4472 out of 5000 in a single day.\n\n[b][u]2) Fabulous Topperweins[/u][/b]\nThe "Fabulous Topperweins," a husband and wife pair, were exhibition shooters in the early to mid-20th century. Adolf, or "Ad", began shooting as a boy, and held many positions as a professional exhibition shooter. When he married his wife, Elizabeth, later known as "Plinky", she began to shoot, and soon eclipsed her husband''s not inconsiderable skills. Together, they worked as professional shooters for Winchester for over 40 years. Common tricks were Plinky shooting cigarettes out of Ad''s mouth, or shooting buttons off of his vest. Ad''s closing act was to draw an Indian''s head on a board with bullet holes.\n\n[b][u]3)Ed McGivern[/u][/b]\nEd McGivern was an exhibition shooter and firearms trainer who specialized in the revolver. He still holds a number of speed shooting records (a number of which have been challenged, and some broken, by modern IPSC champion Jerry Miculek) and was known for shooting aerial targets. Common tricks included:\nThrowing a tin can in the air, and firing six shots through it before it hit the ground \nThrowing a dime into the air and shooting it \nThrowing a playing card into the air, and splitting it with a bullet.\n\n[b][u]4)Tom Frye[/u][/b]\nIn 1959, champion Tom Frye of Remington Arms Company broke Ad Topperwein''s aerial shooting record for shooting 2 1/4 inch cubes of wood thrown in the air. Over a period of 13 9 hour long days, using several Remington Nylon 66 semi-automatic .22 Long Rifle rifles, he hit 100,004 of the 100,010 blocks thrown in the air. Frye''s record is disputed because his thrower tossed the blocks in line with the rifle barrel, while Topperwein''s thrower tossed the blocks perpendicular to the rifle barrel, thus making Topperwein''s shots much more difficult.Also among Frye''s accomplishments was a run of 800 straight singles in trap, set in 1963.\n\n[b][u]5)John Huffer[/u][/b]\nIn 1987, at the age of 50, John "Chief AJ" Huffer shot 40,060 consecutive 2 1/2 inch square pine blocks over a period of 8 days without a single miss, shooting blocks he himself tossed into the air, for 14 hours a day. Huffer accomplished this using 18 .22 Long Rifle Ruger 10/22 rifles, which he cycled through as assistants loaded them for him. Huffer also markets a special "Chief AJ" branded Daisy BB gun, based on a modified model Huffer uses for daily practice, and an instruction manual and video for his style of point shooting.\n\n[b][u]6)Herb Parsons[/u][/b]\nHerb Parsons (1908-1959) of Somerville, Tennessee, was Winchester''s SHOWMAN SHOOTER for 30 years and was Adolph Topperwein''s protégé and successor. His impressive list of honors includes: All-American Trap and Skeet Shooter; twice National and twice International Duck Calling Champion; and inductee to Trapshooting Hall of Fame, Cody Firearms Museum and Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. Parsons is considered by many to be the greatest exhibition shooter of shotguns and rifles in history. His signature feat was throwing by hand and individually breaking seven clay targets with a Winchester Model 12, 12 gauge pump shotgun.', ''),

It is said to be capable of eating up whatever you feed it. Comes with a thumb-safety and decocker, though the decocker only lowers the hammer to quarter-cock (or half-cock) position, unlike other decockers, which fully lower the hammer. The PT92 is a pretty big, heavy pistol; Do not expect it to serve conceal carry duty. However, it is perfect for home defense, as far as handguns are concerned. The PT99 is the adjustable sight version, some problems with the rear sight have been reported.\n\nIf I wanted something for range work, or HD, this would be my pistol of choice. I feel the thumb safety feature is very important for those who want their guns that way. And don''t discount the PT92 simply because it is a clone of the earlier Beretta 92. According to an article in Handguns magazine in 1990, the author wrote that the Taurus were as good as Beretta, and he quoted a famed gunsmith mentioning that the steel on Taurus was actually better.\n\nBtw, if someone is looking for something shorter, the PT917 is also available.', ''),

(45544, ' There are several Police Training Schools.\n\nThe one in Islamabad say near Sehala is the National Police Academy. Its like the equivalent of the Pakistan Military Academy. The officers enetering the Police Service actually attend this academy after doing their initial induction at the CSS Academy in Lahore. The national police academy also includes more advanced Police training such as Criminology, Forensics etc.\n\nThe next tier of Police Training Schools are provincial specific. Say like the training school in lahore (the one that was attacked). Thats where the recruits for constables and asi''s etc are given asic training. (These would be like the Regimental Centres for the army where Other Ranks are given basic training). I think all the olice ranges have their own schools. Like in Sindh there is one in KHI. (i am not that familiar with the Police Training School locations but they are Saeedabad and Shahdadpur)\n\nThe next level of training is speciaised. This would be for professional trades: Wireless operators, ATF etc(am familiar with ATF set-up though). The ATF training school in Punjab is located near Simli) It is commanded by a serving SSG officer at the rank of a Major who is seconded from the SSG-Army. The instructors are a mix of SSG NCO''s and Police ATF personnel. (This training is different from the Elite Force Training) The school trains personnel from all Police Forces (such as Sindh Police, Punjab Police, NWFP Police and that from Balochistan and even Pak Rangers, FC etc). The teams based in Simli are also actually supposed to be on call to respond to Terror threats.  Typically the personnel trained here are personnel who have aleady gotten Elite Force training in their provinces and are then selected or volunteer for ATF. The training is tough and includes Sniper, Hostage Rescue, Killing House, Rapelling etc. Like a SSG Zarrar trained person without airborne capability. This school was set up under the aegis of the Army SSG in the 80''s. The idea was that these would become like the SWAT teams for the Polce but has not actually materialised that way since the trained personnel donot usually form an elite force within the police and are actually returned to the "Thaana" or the Elite Force.\n\nI missed out the Elite Force Training and that is done at provincial level again. The one in KHI is in Razakkabd and was set up by an ex SSG officer who was tasked to run and train the first batch. The current SSP for the Elite Force in KHI is an officer who was amongst the first candidates in Simli. Now the school is run by Police personnel as there are enough Elite Force insructors and training schools out there. There are equivalent schools and forces in the Punjab-you might see them in their black track suits with the the No fear slogan.\n\nSorry that the thread got derailed---Guilty if charged.', ''),

They are offering an adapter as well as the suppressor/silencer for GSG 5 Pistol version which you have. However, I do need to point out that silencers are illegal for civilians.\n\nSecondly, DAAD has the collapsible stock for your gun, but he''s asking around 8k for it.

Got mugged twice and a couple of months ago had a big robbery at my place. was shattered!. I am a total newbie and have never used a handgun in my life. I have relatively SMALL HANDS and my budget for a handgun is Rs.25,000/ max. Pls guide me on what handgun to buy. Pls also guide me as I have a couple of more queries to ask all experts as I am very inexperienced .\n\n1) Should I buy a used REVOLVER, ARMINIUS OR TAURUS, used for 12-20K. I have heard that they are easy to operate, maintain and have few malfunctions. Or should I purchase a 30 bore pistol, 9 MM or what. I dont mind a Pakistani one which should not be too heavy. Pls advise.\n\n2) If I do purchase one (if I get a licence) where do I practice. Where do the experts practice and fire their rounds. I read from this forum that it is very dangerous to fire in the air and someone could get hurt. Now, the Karsaz range is also closed. Any suggestions. I know this is a naive question, buy guys pls help.\n\n3) How do u guys clean and maintain yr pistols. Is it hard?. Can I try it myself or give it to dealer to service/clean. How much do u think the dealers will charge for cleaning/servicing.\n\n4) As I am a total newbie, I was wondering if u all can let me know if there is a place/club or person who can teach me or aquaint me in how to load/unload, insert and eject a magazine, use safety features etc before I buy a pistol. I don''t mind paying for the instructions. Or if any of u members might be interested, i would love to familiarize myself with the working knowledge of pistols or revolvers. Thanks and again sorry for a silly question\n\n5) what is the procedure for selling a licenced firearm. If I sell my handgun to a dealear, will he endorse it on my licence?. Do I have to inform the DCO for the sale?. What about the PS?. Do I have to inform them also that I have sold my weapon so that they can update their records as well?\n\nSorry for all these questions, but if u all experts can provide some brief answers It would go a long way for me to make an informed decision reg purchase and handling.\n\nAwaiting yr quick reply guys\nthanks\nSD 26', ''),

No modern ammo is corrosive whether made in China,Russia or POF.\nCorrosive primers are those which use Fulminate of Mercury in the priming compound of the primers , these do  give off a pungent smell and if the weapon is not cleaned after firing the barrels will rust. This ammo was in use till the early seventies and now discontinued due to mercury pollution and the extra care needed for cleaning weapons.

(46293, ' I see many members interested in air weapons so I am putting down a few things I know about these.\n\nVery cost effective to use(obvious) and provide excellent platform for developing shooting skills.\nCO2 powered air weapons are not the latest in use these days. The latest weapons use compressed air and the refillable  cylinders are attached under the barrels. I am primarily talking about competition level weapons. Normally one cylinder is good enough for over 200 shots.\nLahore club has the facility to refill these cylinders. They fill a scuba tank with a compressor and these small cyliders can be refilled from that tank.\nPujab always participate in the air pistol event as many members own these top grade pistols. Ofcourse, like other diciplines, army and navy steal the show. But who knows about tomorrow.\nThese pistols are sometimes available locally. If not, these can be imported through some arms dealers. Mostly these are single shot weapons. European manufacturers dominate this field like morini, walther, hammerli FWB etc., but the one cosidered to be the best of all is styer LP 10 from Austria. It swept the olympic medals in Beijing. \nStyer LP 10 is available at Buksh Ellahi Lahore for around 140 thousand. Anyone interested to buy one do make sure the grip size suits you.\nRegards,\nmunir', ''),

Its just that its primarily not used as a tactical/combat shotgun.. There may be some variations I have not personaly seen. But certainly when I was shopping for a H/D shotgun .

(46390, ' [quote=Abbas]\nIn a nutshell, Grain is the measurement of weight of the projectile itself. The heavier it is the more:\n\n1). Expensive \n2). Hitting Power\n3). Accurate ( less wind drift )\n[b]4). Slower\n5). More Stable in flight[/b].[/quote]\n\nNice info Abbas, I have added two more to the list, I hope you don''t mind.\nThese are the reasons which make them more accurate hence preffered choice of all competetion shooters. They also use less amount of charge, just enough to make them reach the target without too much drop, which in return reduces recoil and muzzle flip also. All this helping to get higher accuracy.', ''),

I was just referring to the effectiveness & application part of .22lr bolt-action & semi-autos. As for the availability & laws are concerned, you very well know that they vary from city to city.\n\nFor the scope, as I mention earlier & dealer suggested the same that, 3-9x40 is good for medium sized game. It sure works for .22lr but not an ideal. I understand from your concern that .22lr should have less powerful scope as its a less powerful caliber with limited range. \nIt sounds right, but lets take an example. There is a soft drink can placed @100 meters and a deer is standing next to it. Looking thu a 3-9x40 scope, the deer will fill your eye-piece whereas u''ll be able to see about 1mm sized can. Even if we take the deer to 300 meters it will still appear larger than the can placed @100 meters. Thats where we need higher magnification. So the higher magnification scope will assist in placing a bullet on the ''i'' dot of pepsi rather than just the whole can.\n\nSo, in other words, the scope should be selected according to the size of the targets and its distance from the shooter rather than just power or range of the caliber fired. I hope I''m clear on this.', ''),

I started using airguns since the age of 6, and am still an airgun fan. I have kept and used Hennel (germany), BSA (UK), Diana 34 (Germany), Diana 350 Magnum, Diana 54, Weihrauch HW 77 (Germany). I have recently asked a friend to bring me Weihrach HW 90 (air spring piston).\nWith Diana 54, HW 77, and HW 90 doves and crows upto 70-80 yards can be shot easily if one is using good pellets, and a scope. I find Crossman Premiers and JSB Exact pellets to be excellant in high powered air rifles. If one can afford it, I would advise against wasting money as well as loosing confidence in one''s abilities by getting cheap Pakistani, Chinese or other airguns below 500 $.\nI regularly shoot partridges, rabits, doves with my airguns.

If you see the slide of a berretta the the area around the right locking lug recess is very weak and thin.[/quote]\n\nwell skeeter, nice information, but the catastrophic failure you just told us happened after XM9 trials in U.S. and basically there were total of round about 10 to 13 cases where the slides were broken, and it was done majorly by NAVY SEALs. \n\nalot of investigation was done after that, and slides were found to be made of defective steel, which they sometime refer as french steel. also the navy seals used PROOF AMMO in the pistols, it was as hot loaded as upto 70,000PSi. \n\n92FS was manipulated in total of 2 tests, XM9 and XM10, where it won both times. It was the pistol which showed very nice reliability and also durability. It is only after the tests, stories of it failing, started to grow out in general. Otherwise it was prooved way good in tests.\n\nThis era or period, where it was suggested by armorers that the slides be changed is the same when the slides got broken and Investigation was going on. Now after that Beretta made some changes to the pistol which include: - change in arcs of the locking block, and more protruded hammer along with changes in slides, this yielded the version we now call Beretta 92F(S) which was previously known as Beretta 92F.\n\nNow these kind of catastrophic failures are a history on part of 92FS pistol, but quite a few people have still remembered it, for good or bad? they better know it.', ''),

Starting in the late 1970s and going into the next decade, the U.S. Air Force was originally selected to lead the selection process. Entrants included the Beretta 92S-1, Colt SSP, Smith & Wesson 459, FN DA, FN FA, FN High Power, Star M28, Heckler & Koch P9S and H&K VP70.[citation needed] The Beretta would be declared the winner, but the U.S. Army contested the results. The DOD and JSSAP gave the task to the Army starting in 1981.\n\nThe first Army test resulted in all pistols failing. The standards were lessened and a retest was done, but again, none passed.\n\nBy 1983, a new program was started, now called under the XM9 name. These service pistol trials would result in adoption of the Beretta 92F as the M9 Pistol. Note that these later trials did not have all of the same pistols competing.\n\nControversy over these trials lead to the XM10 trials, but these were boycotted by some makes and resulted in the Beretta M9 winning again.\n\n[b]SIG-Sauer''s P226 passed the XM9 trials but lost out in the final bidding.[/b] In a later competition for a compact service pistol, SIG-Sauer''s P228 became the M11 pistol.[/quote]', ''),

As I started to train, I actually became impressed with what could be achieved with the 22LR in short and medium distances and wondered about the actual lethality of the round, so I decided to do some research in that area.\n\nI mean, I know that the 22LR has been a good hunting round for small critters/varmints such as rabbits and squirrels but occasionally you hear it is used as well for killing deers, coyotes and bigger animals – heck, on the internet, you can even find a story about the elephant being killed with a 22LR on the internet, LOL!\n\nDuring my research, I came upon several instances whereby the 22 LR has also been used by the military and law enforcement as well. There were several stories of Chechen snipers using the 22LR in urban setting or Israeli snipers using it in “crowd control”\n\nI started talking to several many people through bulletin boards to find more information about the lethality of that round, specifically from a tactical viewpoint – I.E. How effective and lethal is it? Any information about its lethality should also of interest to the average target shooters or even plinkers, being that it is one of most available/cheap round. Having the correct information could make people more aware of the possible consequences of not treating the 22LR with respect - I think we’ve all heard “ It’s just a 22! It’s not that powerful, etc…”\n\nTo get back to the subject, talking to hunters on various message boards and filtering out the “I heard that or someone told me”, here are some of the typical feedback/information I received from people who actually did it:\n\nLots of varmint kills up to 150 yards (This distance came up the most).\nLarger animals kills at shorter distance – Deer/Coyotes at 100 yards and some even 150 yards\nMention of a larger animal kill at 200 yards\nMention of actual rabbit kills at 175, 225 and 330 yards\n\nOverall the distance of 100 to 150 yards came up in 50% of the responses.\n\n\nTo go back to the “tactical” aspect and the actual effectiveness/lethality of the round in military/law enforcement settings – no real information was actually available. There were lots of stories and hearsay of people getting shot with 22s and how effective it was (or wasn’t) but no ACTUAL and PROVEN information – the main feedback was that shot placement was the most important in a military/law enforcement setting but there were no answers as to what would happen if someone was shot with a 22LR at medium distance (200 to 300 yards). When would the round stop penetrating several layers of clothing/skin and become completely ineffective and useless from a tactical point of view.\n\nGathering all the information from hunters, target shooters, etc… I personally came up with the conclusion that the 22LR “may be” effective up to 200 yards and possibly penetrate several layers of clothing which are usually something like a “t-shirt, a shirt and a jacket” and frankly I would not have been surprised if it didn’t penetrate at all.\n\nActual information not being available, I decided to conduct a test myself to see how far would a 22LR round penetrate 3 layers of clothing and penetrate skin as well. I looked at several options such as using ballistic gel, wet newspaper, etc… but finally ended up with the cheapest option and, what I thought the somewhat most realistic as well: purchasing a frozen turkey, thaw it and wrap it in 3 layers of clothing. This would be a good test to see how far the 22LR would penetrate.\n\nHere is an account of my “experiment” and Boy! Was I in for a surprise in many levels!!!!!!!\n\nThe test took place in the California desert at my usual shooting place for long distance shooting – far away from civilization and very safe. As it happens sometimes, nature has its own mind and does not always follow your plans. The weekend I chose and got ready for (including thawing the meat) ended up being quite windy.\n\nHow windy? Here is a look at my tent during the trip – yep, that’s the wind pushing the side of the tent nearly flat. Wind was an average of 25 MPH with gusts up to 30 MPH and lowest at 18MPH. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/844/93142032.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThis was a nightmare for any rimfire shooter and frankly I was extremely close to just pack it up and go home after doing some shooting with my 308. I thought shooting the 22LR in these conditions (the wind was quite violent and shifting constantly between 18 and 30MPH) would be absolutely impossible.\n\nThe main goal of the trip was this research and I already purchased the turkey so I decided to at least “Try it” with much reservation as to being able to actually hit the target. Having participated in many tactical long distances matches over the years, I decided to follow my own hard learned lesson: “When in doubt, follow what the book says” or, simply, trust your ballistic information, instruments and basic field craft. Because I use the 22LR for training, I pretty much replicated my setup and had at hand all I needed such as ballistic data card for elevation and windage, wind meter and range finder. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/7475/45515980.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThe setup for the turkey was as follow: 3 layers of clothing wrapped around it and taped in the back (although care was given to not make the clothing too tight either) and a white paper on top so we could see the impacts at long distance. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/5862/45682910.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\nThe test was done at the maximum distance of 300 yards because honestly, I thought that penetration would probably not occur at that distance and because, above 300 yards, using my elevation knob and even mildots was pretty much useless.\n\nA 400 yards shot is basically an 80 MOAs drop. Even shooting at 300 yards requires me to place my elevation for 200 yards (27.5 MOAs) and use 6.6 MILS (actually already off the mildots reticle so there is somewhat of a guess).\n\n[b](continued below)[/b]', ''),

The Ballistic coefficients of the .30 180gr and 7mm 140gr are virtually identical, so all rounds will lose velocity at a similar rate. The 7mm starts off with more velocity, so flight time will be shorter. A shorter flight time reduces the effects of wind and target movement.\n\n        Out to at least 300yds the 7mm Rem Mag performs slightly better than the .300 Win Mag while producing only the recoil forces of a .308. I don''t have any figures for performance beyond this range, but during the Boer war 7x57mm Mausers were effective at more than 800yds. The 7mm Rem Mag fires an identical round at a higher velocity.\n\n        Since I wrote the above section, I''ve discovered the ballistics calculator at [url=http://www.realguns.com]www.realguns.com[/url] that is linked to below. The differences in velocity and ballistic coefficient of the 180gr .300 Win Mag and 140gr 7mm Rem Mag do not seem to be significant. Out to 1000yds flight time is the same for both rounds. At 1000yds the .300 has more energy, while the 7mm has dropped less. Both still have more than enough energy to be lethal.\n\n        There is no reason why Police forces should be restricted to Military or NATO standard ammo. In fact they are neglecting their primary job of public safety by using such rounds if more effective alternatives are available.\n\n        It could be argued that the 7mm Rem Mag has too much range for certain police operations. In such cases the round can be down loaded to produce velocities similar to the 7mm-08. Even such a reduced power round will still shoot better than a .308 :-\n\n7mm-08 140gr at 2860 fps has a MPBR of 285yds\n7mm-08 120gr at 3000fps has a MPBR 291yds.\n\n        For certain situations heavier, shorter ranged bullets may be needed:-\n\n        The 200gr round is the heaviest loading for the .300 commonly available. It will be noted that the 175gr 7mm rounds compares very favorably with both this round and the 250gr .338 Lapua Magnum.\n\n        I''ve used the 7mm Rem Mag. For purposes of illustration. There are other rounds with similar performance:- the 7mm Rem SAUM and 7mm WSM. The 7mm-08 and the .270 Win are both superior to the .308/7.62mm for shorter range shooting.', ''),

Safety was definitely an issue but also, in order to have any chance to hit the target with winds that strong we had to shoot within the wind. Even then, because of the constant shifting of the wind from 7 to 5 O’clock, I had doubts we could even pull it off. So instead of 300 yards, we actually started at 250 yards which allowed me to use my elevation knob zeroed at 200 yards and my mildots reticle and thus “less guessing”.\n\nAs you can see the package is quite small at 250 yards!!!!!! The wrapped Turkey was a bit bigger then a human head, it wasn’t a big turkey to start with – I actually bought the cheapest one ($12)\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/9738/15188215.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nWe positioned ourselves on top of the Jeep. My son used my 308 and the Leupold 6.5-20X to spot me (if we could do so) and I shot the 22LR.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/4273/21713135.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nEquipment was as follow:\n\nSavage Mark II BTVS in 22 LR\nBushnell 3200 Tactical Scope – 10X Mildots\nAmmunition was Wolf Match Target – 40 Gr Bullet – 1050 fps\n\nNote that shooting in that position was not the most stable and 25-30 MPH wind actually WILL shake you around. I calculated the wind cycle to range from around 18 to 30 MPH. It was a quick wind cycle with periods of 18 MPH lasting only a 4-5 seconds at best. I decided to shoot at the lowest point of the wind cycle and simply use 0 windage as I was shooting in the wind.\n\nMy first round went slightly to the left missing the target by a couple of inches, my second round did the same on the right side and my third one actually hit the small turkey dead center. I was actually amazed!!!!!!\nI was ready to shoot 50 rounds in those windy conditions to have some “Hope” to hit the target because, from what I was told, the 22LR is so unstable in the wind at long distance. Yet despite the atrocious conditions – using elementary ballistic information and field craft, shooting it in 18 to 30 MPH was factually quite easy. From a tactical viewpoint, every single shot would have hit a center mass target.\n\nInspecting the 250 yards target was quite revealing…the bullet had gone through the 3 layers as if it was nothing.\n\nEncouraged by the results and the fact that we could hit the target, we placed the turkey at 300 yards. I spotted for my son and he took the shots. Again we were amazed that despite the wind we had 4 hits out of 10 rounds!!! If someone had told me he can shoot such a small target in those conditions, before we did so ourselves, I would have laughed! \n\n(continued)', '');

(46543, ' Myths and errors regarding the path of a bullet generally come from a lack of understanding of the forces acting on the bullet before, during, and after its path through the barrel. This article will deal with the primary forces on a bullet''s trajectory, and it will mention a few of the secondary forces. The approach is directed toward the average reader. There is no attempt to address concerns of the mathematician or physicist, who should either know this material or should read a more technical and comprehensive treatise.\n\nOne of the more pervasive myths associated with bullet trajectory is that "bullets always rise right after they leave the barrel." In general, bullets do rise after leaving the barrel, and they immediately begin to drop. This is not a contradiction, and the explanation is not difficult to understand.\n\nBullets are affected by gravity whether in flight or not, and, when they leave the barrel, they no longer have any physical support, such as the brass, the box, your pocket, the magazine, the chamber, or the barrel, so they begin to fall. In addition, they are traveling through air, so air resistance progressively slows their flight. On most occasions the barrel is slanted upward slightly to compensate for this immediate drop; thus, for all but extreme shots, since the barrel is aimed slightly upward, the bullet does, indeed, rise slightly after it leaves the barrel, but it bullet never rises above the axis of the barrel. (Just like a football generally rises above the player when they throw a pass. The longer the pass, the greater the starting angle, and the higher the "rise" before the ball begins to fall.)\n\nIn scientific terms, "thrown" objects, whether by hand, explosion, springs, compressed air, or other forces, are called "projectiles," their path in space is called their "trajectory," and the study of their trajectories is called "ballistics." Those who fail to understand the elementary physics of ballistics often misinterpret the configuration of barrel and the line of sight and assume that something "special" happens to the bullet during its flight. Many things happen, but nothing "special;" bullets fly just like any other projectile and are subject to the same laws of physics.\n\nThe following drawings, though not to exact scale, show the typical paths of bullets and the relationship of these paths to the line of sight, whether determined by open sights or optical sights.\n\nHorizontal Shot. If the barrel is horizontal to the surface of the earth when fired, the bullet never rises above the barrel, and gravity causes an immediate descent.\n\n[img]http://www.chuckhawks.com/bullet_trajectory1.jpg[/img]\n\nTypical Alignment. Generally, for what we consider a "horizontal" shot, the sight alignment places the barrel in a slightly upward tilt, and the bullet starts its arc, rises slightly above the level of the muzzle, but never above the axis of the barrel, reaches a peak, then descends. Figure 2 is the graph of a centerfire rifle cartridge that stays within a 6 inch circle for a distance of about 210 yards. Sighted in at approximately 170 yards, this round is approximately 3 inches high at 100 yards and three inches low at approximately 210 yards. You must, of course, always check trajectory data for your particular rifle and cartridge combination.\n\nVelocity. The velocity is a factor in determining energy on impact and the horizontal velocity determines how far the bullet travels before it hits the ground. The above illustrations apply to all ballistic projectiles whether bullets, rocks, or ping pong balls.\n\nLow Velocity Bullets. Bullets at nominally 800 fps to perhaps 1600 fps, such as 22 LR, most pistols, and older rifle cartridges, must follow a rather high arc in order to reach a target 100 yards away. In fact, most of these slower cartridges are only useful to about 50 yards, perhaps 75 yards for some in the upper end of this range.\n\nHigh Velocity Bullets. Bullets at 2600 fps and up, such as the .223, 22-250, .243/6mm, .270, .308, 30-06, follow a much lower arc to reach a target, and their useful range can be upward of 200 yards. These are often referred to as "flatter" trajectories. With higher velocities, these bullets go much further before gravity and air resistance cause them to fall below the initial line of sight.\n\nSince the barrel is generally directed at an angle to the line of sight, sighting directly upward or directly downward results in a trajectory that deviates even more from the line of sight than the typical, relatively level shot. Still, the effects of gravity and air resistance are the same as far as the bullet is concerned, it is just that the trajectory at such a steep angle is more divergent from the line of sight.\n\nSecondary Ballistics Phenomena. In general, bullets follow a parabolic arc. In reality, that arc is modified significantly by air resistance, which slows the bullet during flight and effects a shortening of the arc down range. That is why the highest point of the usable portion of the trajectory is not the midpoint of that trajectory. Bullet shape and the spin from rifling also influence the trajectory slightly by reducing air resistance and stabilizing bullet orientation. That is why a 500 grain rifle bullet, for example, has a much better trajectory than a 500 grain ball from a smooth bore, all other things being equal.\n\nFact or Myth. So, does a bullet rise after it leaves the muzzle? One says, "yes." Another says, "no." Who is correct? Both could be correct because of different meanings associated with the word, "rise." They might argue incessantly, but their argument will not change the physical aspects of the path of the bullet. If they would concentrate on discussing the physical events, they would eventually conclude that they were each using the word, "rise," differently or that one of them did not understand elementary ballistics.\n\nThought Question. When sighted in for a typical hunting or target situation, what is the path of the bullet in relation to the sight picture if the rifle is aimed directly up or down?', ''),

The probability is that the bullet hit some of the sage brush that was moving around wildly in the wind because no other impacts showed signs of keyholing and we were somewhat shooting through the moving brushes.\n\nNow the huge surprise was the following. After taking the shot at 250 yards I was quite happy to see that the bullet had penetrated the 3 layers of clothing but I would have never thought of actually checking the BACK OF THE TARGET.\n\nAfter shooting the 300 yards and taking back the target to the Jeep, we realized that one round had gone through the whole turkey, the clothing layers in the front AND the layers in the back as well!!!!!!!!!! And this had to occur between 250 yards and 300 yards. This was MUCH MORE than I ever had anticipated for the standard velocity 22LR round!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNot only that but because the clothing was wrapped around and folded/taped in the back, it was the equivalent of shooting through 3 layers of clothing in the front and 6 LAYERS of clothing in the back plus on layer of duck tape! \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/258/84841610.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nWe did one more shot at 100 yards and the round went through easily.

Combat weapons have loose tolerances due to the fact that being out in the field the pistol will not get that much cleaning sooo the loose part fitted together provide enough gap for it to function or in the case of Glock - they have incorporated rail point where the slide rail is four small point and the dirt can fall out should it come inside the slide.\nThese barrels are very very tightly fitting especially the BarSto and ESPECIALLY if you get the oversize barrel which has to be custom fitted.

The bullet that expanded consistently i.e., CCI Stinger 32gr managed only 6.9 inches of penetration. Likewise Quick Shok 32gr expanded considerably but managed only 6.4 inches of penetration.\n\nThis shows that for close range (less than 50 hards), one should choose the bullets with maximum expansion capability while for ranges beyond 50 yards, the standard rounds are preferable, both from penetration as well as cost point of view.\n\nAnother thing to note in the table given is that 22LR ammo of 30 grains to 40 grains are more than enough to reach maximum possible penetration. However, heavier (higher grain) bullets do help in increasing flight stability and hence accuracy. Flight stability is critical especially in a light bullet such as 22LR. \n\nTo sum it up, over a period of time, and after testing and practicing, you tend to find out which ammo serves your different purposes at different distances.', ''),

(46580, ' A good airgun must have attributes of accuracy and power. Whereas power is a function which is based on its design, the accuracy part has a number of variables. Some of these are gun design, quality of trigger, expertese of shooter and above all type and quality of pellets being used. since airguns lack in muzzle velocity as compared to rifles, therefore i n their case the requirement of accuracy increases manyfold and thus by implication the importance of all these variables and some more. When I say above 500 $, I mean to point towards higher end air rifles like, FWB, Weihrauch, Walthers, Theoben etc.\nIn my experience Diana 350 Magnum, and others of same power rating have so much of recoil that a normal man can not handle these. I for one got rid of my Diana 350 within a month because its power was useless to me as I couldnt hit anything beyond 30 yards with consistency. Diana 54 on the other hand is absolute beauty due to its recoilless operation. Similarly Weirauch HW 90 due to its air spring piston is vibration free and therefore extremely accurate yet very powerful.\nIf you want to knock down rabbits at 40 yards or beyond, you need power and accuracy to score head shot kills.\nThe best airguns in Pakistani market that I have seen are Diana 45 and thats it.

I personally have no experience with it so can''t say much. Now a days 7.62x51 Nato has the highest demand and is getting very scarce but still no body is buying POF and Indian stuff which is still available at reasonably low price. Its non corrosive.\n\nIf any of you end up with corrosive ammo, just ensure that after you are done shooting, spray your gun barrel and chamber area with mixture of water and ammonia ( windex or ammonia based glass and window cleaner is best) until you reach back home, then properly clean and lube it. Water and ammonia based mixture neutralizes the corrosive salts for 8-10 hours and delays its chemical reaction bringing salt to the surface.\n\nI shoot lots of 7.62x54 and 7.62x 25 surplus ammo, which happens to be mostly corrosive.

(47033, ' .22 Auto losing energy ?\n\nI beg to differ. There is practically no loss of velocity /energy in an auto .22 when compared with a bolt.\nWhen an auto .22 is fired the gas pressure seals or obturates the chamber \nand as the bullet leaves the barrel \nthe gass pressure starts to drop and the force of obturation is lesser than the remaining gas pressure in the barrel thus the bolt moves back and ejects the case. \nThe process of re chambering is accomplished by the recoil spring.\nWhen you fire and extract a case from a bolt action it is cool, a case ejected after firing an auto is very hot to touch due to the friction caused by the remaining gas pressure and the case sticking to the chamber walls due to obturation.\nI have chronographed a berretta .22 rifle which can be made to fire single shot or semi and in both cases the average velocity of ten shots   is the same \n. I used an Oehler 35 P chronograph.\nThe same thing can be confirmed by consulting the net or other sources, it is a popular question.\nI want to add there are different type of actions to operate an autu weapon these are as follows;\n\nBlow back\n\n      For .22, 9mm Makarov , .32 & 25 pistols .380 pistols all  low pressure rds and less gas volume\n\nDelayed Blow back\n\nRifle G3, H&K Pistol P7 and  H&K M13  9mm\n\nRecoil operated \n\nThese are weapons where the Barrel actually moves back to unlock, Glock, Browning 9mm, TT, Walther P99 and all 9mm pistols except the ( Steyer GB now out of production, it was gas operated), MG 1A 3 machine gun, Browning A5 Auto shotgun etc a variant, inertial in the Bennelli\n\nGas Operated\n\nIn these the Barrel is fixed but there is a gas port and piston which move the carrier to unlock the bolt after the bullet has gone out the barrel, like .30 Browning machine gun, Berretta Auto shotguns, and several other shotguns and auto weapons  like the Ak and  M16  (with a slight variation these work without a piston but direct gas impingement,) the Ruger and some other variants are now available with the piston as well.\n\nAll these actions are designed to save the weapon and shooter from damage/injury. I f the bolt opens when the round is still in the barrel the weapon will blow up and   God help the shooter. Only in the case of the Gas operation a very tiny bit of gas is bled into the gas cylinder to move the piston back. The moving parts are several times heavier than the bullet and a very minute amount of gas moves the parts back;  the bullet moving much faster is several feet out of the barrel when remaining gas pressure moves the parts back.\n\nIn all cases the bullet is well clear of the barrel and gas pressure rapidly falling when the process of un locking and extraction begins.\nI pray I have been able to explain in as simple terms as possible. There will be several doubts and questions  lurking in the minds of some brothers , please shoot.\nThe operating cycle of an auto weapon other than Blow back is as under;\nFeeding,  Chambering, Locking , Firing , Un locking , Extraction , Cocking , Ejection and again Feeding.\nIn case of Blow Back it is Feeding , Chambering ,Firing , Extraction (after bullet clears barrel) cocking and ejection and then refeeding', ''),

(47187, ' Brothers more physics to come.\n\n1. I am neither to win an argument nor to score a point, its just to put a question to the audience and more learned people and in the process learn more. Before making my point I would like to elaborate few terms for better understanding.\n 	 a.	Caliber. Commonly it is the measurement of the diameter of the barrel of the gun  either in inches or in mm. The measurement is done from groove to groove or land to land.\n	b.	Land and Grooves. Projectiles are provided stability through fins or spin. Fins like that of mortor bombs, RPG 7 rockets etc and spin for all rifles. The barrels are rifled and the raised portion is called land while the cut one is called groove.\n	c.	Obturation. Obturation refers to seal or block and in fire arms the phenomenon happens because of expanding of cartridge case (because of heat) and it stops the rearward escape of gases while once the shoulders of bullets / projectiles are engaged with the grooves (the metal expands as well to ensure optimum obturation) they act as a seal to stop the forwrd escape of gasses. Now once the bullet is firmly in contact with lands as well, any push from the rear, because of burning charges and consequent production of gases / pressure, will cause the bullet to rotate as per the rifles of barrel thus providing stability to the projectile or bullet. In larger calibers the frontal seal is provided through driving bands so that the body of shall does not come in contact with the rifles of barrel and no damage is caused to body containing TNT. It is understood that the diameter of bullet is slightly more than the caliber if measurement of caliber is done from land to land else obturation will not occur or the weapon will have obturation failure. In case of caseless cartridges the obturation is provided through the breach block system / chamber like that of 155 Howitzer\n	d.	Peak Pressure. As the charge in the cartridge is ignited it burns producing gases which exert pressure both ways. The rearward movement is stopped due to bolt locking system while the forward pressure makes the projectile mov. As the pressure increases the projectile moves farther down the barrel creating more space for gases allowing the pressure to drop but the rate of pressure development is more than the space being created so it keeps increasing. Finally a stage comes once the charge has been burnt and the pressure is optimum tharafter it will drop. This point is called peak pressure. Though pressure drops thereafter but the projectile keeps accelerating and then it leaves the muzzle. More time a projectile spends in barrel more range will it achieve. It is theoretically said that if the pressure behind the projectile is exactly same as that of atmospheric pressure once it leaves the muzzle then the range will be very long. But doing so involves building miles long barrel-Non practicable.\n2. Now once the bullet leaves the muzzle and there is no stopper in the barrel why should gases still exert pressure rearward and not escape from the muzzle. This is exactly what happens once you fire a blank cartridge. It does not reload the rifle. You have to put up a recoil booster on muzzle to allow enough pressure to build up in the barrel to push the bolt and carrier group backwards for an ejection and subsequent loading through the spring. That proves the point that some gases are required to push the bolt and carrier group backwards for subsequent actions. If x are the total gases and y is the total pressure they generate and z is the pressure / gases required to push the bolt back so the pressure / gasses behind the projectile are supposed to be y-z or x -z in a semi auto as compared to bolt action where there is no going back.\n\n3. There are many sniper rifles rather most of the sniper rifles in world are bolt actions. Most of the hunting rifles are bolt action. If they were not more stable, achieved lesser or equal ranges as that of auto rifles and are not accurate why should they exist. Semi auto sniper rifles are good for relative close ranges where accuracy is less important and rate of fire is more important.  However, what has been mentioned by the honourable member is also worth considering especially once he supports his arguments with a practical. I also subscribe to the fact that bolt actions kick a lot. These are a few sites which gives varied point of views with different logics. There must be many more.

(47188, ' In American markets, this is known as the Winchester Wildcat. Rumors are that this rifle is being manufactured in Russia (reported by GUNS Magazine [i]or[/i] Turkey (reported by Guns & Ammo) and sold in US with the Winchester stamp. Only saw it once before in Saddar, at Harris Traders. Price at that time was 35K.\n\nI do not know its original name, but taking the markings (USSR, as you reported) and the Winchester-Russian story into consideration, we can safely bet that the ones available in Pakistan are 100% Russian.\n\nAs for performance; the Winchester Wildcat had good favorable reviews in magazines. Pretty accurate. Trigger pull takes a bit of getting used to. Safety is pretty funky, not very functional. Its particular design has been made to make it appear reminiscent of the legendary Mosin-Nagant. Good quality folding rear sight. 5- and 10-rd polymer mags are available.\n\nOverall a good small rifle. For the price, it may be able to give the Brno .22 bolt-action a run for its money.\n\nBtw, did many people know that the BRNO .22 we know is actually sold under the name of CZ-452 Lux (and variants) in the US?

(47242, ' Islamabad, Aug. 5 (ANI): A preliminary investigation in Pakistan’s arms licence scam has revealed that Interior Ministry officials tampered with records to issue licences of prohibited weapons.\n\nThe Chairman of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Interior, Abdul Qadir Patel, confirmed that the ministry’s officials were involved in the scam, The Dawn reports.\n\nExplaining the mechanism of the scam, an official involved in the probe said, if a parliamentarian got the recommendation from the competent authority for 10 licences, the ministry’s officials would add four or five names and after the release of demand note they would attach forged bank receipts with the application and get the licences issued.\n\nBefore June 26, when a ban was imposed on issuing licences for prohibited weapons, the arms wing of the interior ministry had been receiving four to five dozen applications a day with recommendations from the competent authority.\n\nThe prime minister, who was the licensing authority, had delegated the powers - to Minister of State for Interior Tasneem Qureshi\n\nA woman parliamentarian told the paper that she had got recommendation for a licence, but names of three other people were added to her application and they also got the licences.\n\n“When I submitted another application for four licences, my file was misplaced by the ministry’s officials, obviously to issue licences to some other people. I complained about it, but nothing happened,” she said. (ANI)', ''),
(47243, ' Islamabad, July 31 (ANI): A ban imposed by Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani on issuance of licences for arms of prohibited bore is likely to remain in place as the government has decided to expand an investigation into award of thousands of permits for banned weapons. \n\nThe Federal Investigating Agency (FIA) is probing interior ministry officials involved in unauthorised issuance of licences. The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Interior had on Wednesday expressed dissatisfaction over the outcome of an initial inquiry after which three section offices were arrested. \n\nThe committee recommended a wide-ranging inquiry to uncover every official involved in the scam.\n\n“The committee has sought complete details of licences so far issued by the ministry and it is looking at the inquiry from various angles,” the committee’s chairman, Abdul Qadir Patel, said. \n\nHe said the scam appeared to be much bigger than initially perceived and the committee wanted a comprehensive probe. \n\n“The ban will remain imposed until the committee completes its own inquiry into the scandal,” The Dawn quoted Patel, as saying. \n\nOn receiving complaints of use of illegal means to get licences for banned arms, Gilani had banned issuance of permits and directed the NA committee to probe the matter.\n\nIn its initial inquiry, the FIA had confirmed use of fake bank receipts and stamps and forged signatures by middle-ranking officials of the ministry on receiving gratification from applicants. \n\nInvestigations also revealed that part of the record in the arms branch of the ministry was missing, strengthening fears that the number of licences issued could have been higher than what is known.\n\nAccording to a report placed before the NA committee, 28,527 licences of prohibited weapons were issued from March 28, 2008, to June 25 this year. According to a ministry official, demand notices for about 10,000 more licences had been issued. (ANI)', ''),

I do hope u already know but just typing so that if you have missed the information you get to know it. And the pistols with Shaheen logo were imported in hundreds, they are available in many cities. \n\nThe Norinco you are referring to are the NP-42, CF-98 is different in manufacturer sense. Norinco made this pistol but due to ban on exporting weapons to other countries due to Norinco Missile Proliferation record, the pistol manufacturing has been shifted to Chang Feng Machinery Tools Co, a subsidiary company of Norinco. This same company specializes in CCW & PDW weapons, their other major product is CF-05 a 50 round PDW & also make CF-07 the little compact version of CF-98. NP-42 are now rare and I haven''t been able to find a new one in Peshawar, it seems new ones don''t come now, most probably old stock would be available or used ones. \n\nSo you won''t find a CF-98 with Norinco Logo, if you do that would be NP-42 the first variant of CF-98 with 10,000 barrel life. \n\nPlus fake manufacturing would be difficult as its firing mechanism is different, so far i have found Stouger 8000 model with the same firing mechanism which are popular and found for sale. There are other models but haven''t heard much about them. \n\nAnd on a light note, who will manufacture fake items of Chinese products :), they themselves make fake items :)', ''),

It does not create any pressure  (relatively) without a bullet.     \n\nCartridges with bullets have propellants in them and the little .22 develops something like  20000 lbs of pressure  and when the bullet leaves the barrel the departing gases create the bang and actually  it take time for all of the gases to  escape in micro or milli seconds what ever but it does not happen in just one go. \nWhen the gasses start escaping the  value of Obturating pressure decreases  ( the gas pressure forcing the case to stick to the walls of the chamber) At the point of bullets departure another force comes into play BOLT THRUST \nAction and reaction are equal and the remaining gas pressure is still high these combine to push the case and the bolt rear wards. All happens after the bullet LEAVES the barrel. If the bullet was inside the barrel and the bolt moved back the thin brass case cannot withstand the 20000 lbs of gas pressure and will rupture sending the gases to break the weapon and injure the shooter.   The CNG cylinder is  supposed to withstand  only 350 lbs of pressure.  Safe shooting', ''),

Its just like the different brands of car, Toyotta is preferred more then another brand in Pakistan, e.g Honda, even Honda make better cars but Toyota is more preferred. \n\nThe same CF-98 last year was around 40k, but as new shipments came, the number of CF-98 increased the prices fell, when i was buying it about 3 months back it was around 35k range, nowadays its 30K. And the new shipment have either some other logo or when i was checking out for my bro same Cf-98 it had no logo, just the serial numbers. \n\nBasically there is one or two big importers who give the order for pistols, so they ask the company to make a logo for them.

I would like to share my experience of blank cartridges. We fire a lot of them in mock exercises and what I wrote is a fact that with out a recoil booster put up on the muzzle of G-3 it does not reload the rifle once firing the blank rounds. Without a recoil booster it gives more bang and every time one has to reload manually. With a recoil booster on, it gives more kick, less bang (noise) and reloads the rifle. In our younger days, once we would not have a recoil booster, we used to stick the muzzle of rifle in mud and fire the blank round to make a desi recoil booster :)  I admitt that in the process the rifle would kick back like a donkey and some times we damaged the rifles also.\n\nNow my turn to ask :)\n\nSince you have been using .22 for a long time I have a querry. Do we have a magnum round in .22? If so can it be chambered in all .22 LRs or like 7mm it can not be chambered in ordinary 7mm? What is the cost difference between the two i.e magnum and the other one and finally which one would you recommend?', ''),

What is the cost difference between the two i.e magnum and the other one and finally which one would you recommend?[/quote]\n\nSirjee, I only have a Hyem .22 Revolver in which I''ve been using 22LR Winchester SuperX rounds since the last 15 years and I''m lined up to to buy a GSG 5 22LR and Taurus 9mm 92B (17+1) as soon as my next two MOIs come (next month hopefully).\n\n\nHowever, based on whatever little I know, I''ll give it a try:\n\n\n1) Yes we do have magnum rounds in .22 - referred to as 22WMR.\n\nHere''s some brief info on it:\n\n.22 Long Rifle\nBullet weight - 40 gr. / Velocity - 1,082 fps. / Energy - 104 ft.lb. / (Subsonic)\nBullet weight - 36 gr. / Velocity - 1,328 fps. / Energy - 141 ft.lb. / (High Velocity)\n\n.22 Magnum\nBullet weight - 40 gr. / Velocity - 2,020 fps. / Energy - 360 ft.lb. \n\n\n2) It (22WMR) cannot be chambered in normal 22 guns. Both 22LR and 22WMR (magnum) are different calibers.\n\n\nMORE INFO:\n\nBullet diameter for the Magnum is .224", the same as for the .22 WRF and most centerfire .22''s. Its case is slightly fatter than a Long Rifle case and, as loaded by Winchester-Western, the Magnum''s original 40 grain bullet came with a real jacket, not just copper plating. Bullet styles include full metal jacket (non-expanding) and jacketed hollow-point (expanding) types. The SD of the 40 grain bullets is .114. As originally loaded a MV of 2000 fps was claimed from a 22" rifle barrel, and 1550 fps from a 6.5" handgun barrel.\n\nAvailable bullet weights have expanded to include 30 grain and 50 grain bullets (SD .142) in addition to the original 40 grain bullets. CCI, Federal, Remington, and Winchester all load .22 WMR ammunition. There is also a .22 WMR shot cartridge, loaded with #11 shot.\n\nThe standard 40 grain bullet is now advertised to have a muzzle velocity of 1,910 fps in a 22" rifle barrel and carries 324 ft. lbs. of energy. From the 6.5" barrel of a revolver the velocity is 1400 fps with an energy of 174 ft. lbs.\n\nThe .22 Magnum is a much more powerful cartridge than the .22 LR. At 100 yards its 40 grain bullet is still carrying 156 ft. lbs. of energy, more than the .22 LR develops at the muzzle (compared in 22" barrels). The flat shooting WMR can be zeroed to hit +0.6" at 100 yards when fired from a scoped rifle, and will give a point-blank range (+/- 1.5") of about 124 yards.\n\nThe power of the Magnum, coupled with the violent expansion provided by its JHP bullet, makes it too much cartridge for shooting cottontail rabbits and squirrels at close range unless only head shot are taken. Body shots tend to literally blow these small animals apart.\n\nUsed for self defence in a revolver, the .22 WMR has compiled a 42% one shot stop rate according to Marshall and Sanow. This is far superior to the .22 LR and .25 ACP, and makes the .22 WMR the best of the small bore handgun cartridges.\n\nWithin its trajectory limitation of about 125 yards, the extra destructive power of the .22 Magnum''s JHP bullet moves it into the varmint rifle cartridge class. Its low report makes it one of the best varmint cartridges for shooting on the small ranches and farms typical of semi-populated areas and in the country outside of small to medium sized towns.\n\nFor years there were lever, pump, and bolt action rifles chambered for the .22 Magnum, but very few autoloaders. This is because the Magnum operates at pressures above those deemed safe for simple blowback actions (the type of action used for all autoloading .22 LR rifles). The rifle manufacturers seemed to have licked the problem in recent years, however, as there is now a selection of autoloading sporting rifles chambered for the .22 WMR. For the serious small game and varmint hunter there are a number of accurate, high grade .22 Magnum bolt action rifles.\n\n\n3) My recommendation on 22WMR : Depends on your requirement. 22LR is almost half the price of 22WMR but in return for going for WMR you get 40% - 50% more velocity. 22LR guns are more common and more reasonably priced than guns which use 22WMR.\n\nSENIOR MEMBERS PLZ CORRECT ME WHERE I WENT WRONG.', ''),

It is parabolic in shape and because the line of the bore is below the line of sight at the muzzle and angled upward, the bullet''s path crosses the line of sight at two locations.\n\nCritical Zone - This is the area of the bullet''s path where it neither rises nor falls greater than the dimension specified. Most shooters set this as ± 3" to 4" from the line of sight, although other dimensions are sometimes used. The measurement is usually based on one-half of the vital zone of the usual target.

In the words of the Guru, "It is unethical to attempt to take game beyond 300 meters." If you do, you should write yourself a letter explaining why it was necessary to do so. An approximate rule of thumb says that the maximum point blank range is approximately your zero range plus 40 yards.\n\nMid-range Trajectory - This is the height of the bullets path above the line of sight at half way to the zero range. It does not occur at the same range as the maximum ordinate height which can be greater.\n\nMinute of Angle (MOA) - A "minute" of angle is 1/60 of a degree which for all practical purposes equates to 1 inch per 100 yards of range.

Never needed anything else. Kindly refer to following information about Brunox;\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® is a long-term lubricant based on a balanced mixture of hydrocarbons with the additive TURBOLINE.\n\nCreep oil / Rust loosener\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® is a multi-component lubricant which has an excellent penetration effect. Therefore it is capable of penetrating into finest hair-chaps and spaces and, for example, loosens tightened screws in a very short time. It loosens rust and frees sticky mechanisms.\n\nAnti-corrosion\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® guarantees complete corrosion protection and also conservation of hollow spaces. The hydrocarbon mixture which is responsible for this guarantees both a compact protection film and also the necessary film thickness which displaces any humidity. It forms a clear, invisible, non-hardening film which does not need to be removed in most cases. (Exception: painting). This film provides temporary protection against corrosion (approx. 6 months) and has a dirt repelling effect.\n\nCleaning agent\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® penetrates and removes mineral and organic dirt so that spots of (almost) all kinds (e.g. tar, brake dust, adhesive residues etc.) can be easily wiped off. It neutralises hand sweat and also protects aluminium, copper, brass, chromium plated and galvanised sheet metal and stainless steel.\n\nContact spray\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® has a very low surface tension and a corresponding adhesion to metals so that leak currents will be prevented and humidity which has penetrated will immediately be displaced. The very high dielectric strength (UD = 45 KV/cm) also allows the application in connection with very sensitive (high-impedance) circuits. This property is particularly useful with electrical contacts and short circuits can be eliminated and prevented.\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® contains no silicone, no teflon, no graphite\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® behaves neutral against varnish, leather, wood, rubber, plastic and fabric\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® contains just 3% propellant (CO2), i.e. 97% active substance\n\nBRUNOX® Turbo-Spray® has a flash point of 78°C\n\nHopefully this will help many people to understand what it actually is. I get it for 450 to 500 and one bottle lasts for quite a while so not that expensive at the end.', ''),

Initially I will register the licence details with NBP and then register the weapon with DCO and the local PS.\n\n1) When I go to sell it to the dealer will lhe stamp my licence that he has bought it from me?. I do not plan to buy a new pistol immidiately but in4 to six months when I have the funds available or maybe later maybe a year or so.\n\n2) Do we have to inform the DCO of the sale?. Should I go personally at DCO office or can the dealer do this for me. Once I do this, my licence book will no show NO WEAPON\n\n3) Now, my licence book is empty (FIREARM SOLD). Will my licence still be valid?.\n\n4) Do I also have to inform my local P.S. that I have sold my weapon so that they update their records and remove the initial entry which was there when I first registered it with them.?\n\n5) What if I did not purchase any weapon for almost 5 yrs and the licence book is empty, and when the time comes for RENEWAL of MOI licence will it be RENEWED.?Can MOI licence which is empty (firearm first purchased and then eventually SOLD) BE RENEWED?\n\nIs the NBP (National Bank of Pakistan) the bank where we will pay our RENEWAL fee only concerned about paying the renewal fee and getting the licence renewed or do they check entries on the licence to see if you have some sort of weapon entry on it.', ''),

And would be pretty expensive too. \n\nAs for CF-07, not heard up till now, as its a compact version for undercover police work or where concealing the weapon is important, and knowing Pakistani mentality don''t think it will be a success as we like BIG guns :) to show off and to have a decent firepower, which this little baby lacks.', ''),

(47566, ' [quote=midreestaj]bore sizes are depiction of the thickness of projectiles where the unit kept in mind is an inch.\n.50 caliber or 50 bore is; .50 of an inch. or say 1/2 inch. likewise .45 caliber or 45 bore is .45 of an inch or 450/100 of an inch.\n\nshotguns are termed in gauges which are not calibers or bores. explained well by  Skeeter60 u can see what a gauge is.\n\nthen there is actual measurement of the projectile in metric system or millimeters. like 9mm, 7mm 10mm. military use this metric system which is way easier and doesnt involve the complication of a bullet measurement nomenclature system. btw i like and prefer it personally as a matter of choice.... now hail to american;s who have gotten us too deep in calibers.[/quote]\n\n@Conceal Carry brother, I agree with the idea the BORES and CALIBERS are measurements.\n\nBUT...\nCaliber is not dimensional measurements of a ROUND. It is rather measrement of a BULLET !\nMilitary is very straightforward when it comes down to application of a round to intended target, their terms of caliber includes the dia of projectile + the length of case and barrels. A military personal can make it more clear.\n\nCaliber and Bore are more of same thing less technically and for all of us :lol:\n\nand however Technically:\nBore is(measurement) related to a Barrel OR a Weapon which is bearing that specific BORE barrel.\nBore measurements are taken from (see rifling Lands/Grooves) a Land to a Land inside a barrel. It is something related to a barrel/weapon but not bullets.\nCaliber measurements are taken from Groove to Groove inside a barrel, which is refered as groove diameter, and which is equal to the Caliber of Bullet used in that barrel.\n\nnow for an EXAMPLE please consider the following: \na 30 caliber rifle uses a .308" dia bullet. Each groove of the rifling is .004" deep. The two opposing grooves measure .008" and the distance across the lands is .300". It all adds up to .308. \n\nCaliber of a weapon? :-\nWhen we talk of Caliber of a weapon, it means the land to land diameter or BORE of weapon actually sometimes like incase of a 30-06 weapon, where BORE is .300 or .30 and Bullet itself is .308 inch.\n\nIncase of AK47, known as a 7.62 or .30cal weapon, where the BORE of weapon is 7.62mm and bullet diameter itself is 7.92mm\n\nWeapon calibers are based on their BORES i.e. land to land mesurements which is always less than CALIBER of bullet used in it. Also sometimes a weapon caliber is same as that of bullet used in it, e.g .308 commercial rifle :) and also 7.62*51mm NATO, here the actual bullet is 7.62mm, BORE must be less that this. But unlike Springfiled we still call the weapon by its ACTUAL BULLET DIA or Groove DIA! \nNOW THIS CONFUSION IS CAUSED BY BULLET NOMENCLATURE!\nI like metric systems, like all jarheads... :)\n\nMoreover, Caliber representation is done with respect to INCHES ! more specifically\nthough Metrics system (mm) is another way to measure the BORE/Caliber of Weapon(loand to land measurements) or Caliber of a Bullet(bullet diameter represented in INCHES).', ''),

(47901, ' Reloading\nIt is a great hobby in itself. One can develop loads for  maximum accuracy for a Rifle after testing as to which bullet weight or bullet the rifle shoots accurately, the seating depth can have an effect on accuracy. One can also manipulate the propellant weight to find out a most accurate load. ( PLEASE ALL THIS IS DONE STRICTLY FOLLOWING THE RELOADING MANUALS AND NOT WITHOUT, EVEN INFORMATION ON THE NET CAN MISLEAD)\nThe ammo cost is cut to almost   1/8  in Pakistan a .357 Round costs (the cheapest being Armscore) about Rs 90/-   but when one reloads it comes to about RS 15/- and if one also casts his own the cost is no more than Rs 7/- or less.\n\nKindly As mentioned do not venture in to this field without proper manuals and some experienced person to guide. I myself and the Forum do not take any responsiblity.\nCost is not the only factor, one can shoot many times more and shooting a boar with your own cast and reloaded bullet from a .44 magnum is a different feeling.\nThe reloaded rifle is so good and accurate I have never purchased rifle ammo in the last 35 years except .223 or sometimes .308 and of course the sweet .22. Millions of people of all ages (18years and up ) reload in the US and almost all of Europe.

Many premium bullets which are available can be reloaded as these are not available in loaded form like Barnes,Woodleigh and Nosler Partitions etc\n \nHobby . One has to research within the limits of safety laid down in the manuals which must be followed strictly.\n\nShooting. One shoots much more on paper for accuracy improving shooting skills as well as greater familiarity with ballistics and the weapon itself.\n\nOptimum Efficiency. Some calibers like the grand old 30-06 and the great 7x57 are under loaded as the calibers are well over a hundred years old. There are many ancient rifles and no one wants consumer liability so these are under loaded.  Following the manuals one can reload these to perform much more efficiently one reason the 30-06 is still the most popular cal. as well as the 7x57.

(48149, ' cant say much about bullets but here is my take on shotgun cartridges:\n\ncasting the lead projectiles (slugs, shots) is relatively easy. no rocket science there. however the science/art part is the calculating powder weight (in gains or grams), type of powder depending on burn speed. why? because projectile weight, powder weight and burn speed can be mixed in almost infinite ways to get infinite results. some results will be good, some results can cause a trip to a truma center with the hospital staff desperately trying to stop bleeding and save whats left of ur eyes/face/arms/hands.\n\nyou see? different combination of above mentioned variables generate different pressure levels, and some pressure spikes are extremely hazardous to the operator and the equipment (firearm) and can result in sever injury.\n\nit is therefore advised to reload with extreme care and never ever, i''ll repeat never ever play with a given recipe, stick to a proven recipe with proven products.\n\nnormaly it is advised to reload -10% of a recipe to be on the safe side. if u wanna go even safer go 15% under the load. however thing is some people in an effort to increase the muzzle velocity just a few feet per second or to increase the down range energy or projectile range, hot load the cartridges(increasing powder charge, increasing the projectile weight, replacing the powder with more hot powder of a different brand/type), upside is u get increased performance, downside is u end up in the market for a prosthetic limb or an artificial eye.\n\nRegards', ''),

Like you say it is advisable to use a lighter (10% ) less load to compensate for individual variations in case dimensions and chambers of weapons of different makes and types. The manuals are very comprehensive.\n\nYes Cartridges for automatic pistols and auto rifles are also reloaded, specially it is a great fun to reload for the 45.\nIn case of auto rifles small base dies are preferred, (more on this later) Search the web for Speer Reloading manual,or Nosler reloading manual,or Hornady reloading manual and you will devour the information there. Or just go for reloading information.\nOnce one starts to reload one shoots so much that one finds himself in a different plane\n\nI hasten to add NEVER REDUCE A GIVEN CHARGE BY MORE THAN 10 PERCENT  as in case of large capacity cases like the 45 or 44 or  all rifle cases the pressure can shoot up blowing the weapon', ''),

(48352, ' You are absolutely right. Guns are very very expensive here in India and we are paying this amount for old guns as import of guns is banned in india since 1984.\nIn handguns a civilian can keep .22, .25, .30 (7.63x25), .32, .380 (9mm kurtz), .357 & .45 (only in Bombay). Rest is banned in india as .38 , .455 & 9mm parabellum is a service calibre and used by police.\n\nIn Rifle .303, 7.62 are PB. Rest calibres are NPB and one can easily keep. \n\nIn Shotgun all calibres are NPB but a few shots of 12 guage are banned here. ie. LG, SG, SSG, AA, AAA are banned. We can only use Slugs, BB, and from No. 1 to 12 as there are allowed here.\n\nRegarding prices of guns, there is no limit. An imported 30.06 rifle costs between 2 lakhs to 20 lakhs depending on the condition. IOF 30.06 rifle is selling aroung 1 lakh rupees. \n\nA good 12 guage english side by side gun costs between 25,000 to 1 Lakh. There are many indian 12 guage gun manufacturers and they cost between 10,000 to 20,000 Rupees.', '');

It uses a reduced caliber, heavy metal (tungsten) .30 inch diameter penetrator wrapped in a "plastic" sabot or "shoe" of .50 inch diameter.\nSince the mass of the saboted penetrator is much lighter in weight than normal ball .50 caliber ammunition, SLAP''s velocity is much higher than a normal round.\nA similar type of kinetic energy shot is also up the sleeve of most of the world tanks and is called APFSDS (armor piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot). It is small rod of extremely solid material like tungsten or depleted uranium, which is fired at extremly high velocities and penetrates through the armor using kinetic energy. Since it cannot go through the other side of tank, hence breaks inside the tank and causes massive damage to tank / crew. If fired against an APC, will simply go through both the sides of APC making two holes only', ''),

Since more of the initial (muzzle) velocity is retained, the trajectory is ‘flatter’ and the time-to-target is reduced – resulting in less wind-drift. A High BC value is, therefore, A Good Thing.', ''),

It has a recoil pad system which is called the Gel-Tek pad which reduces the recoil by almost 25% as compared to any other shotgun which has got a conventional recoil pad.\n\nI have Shot couple of thousand round from this shotgun in every kind of hunting shoots like Quail , Partridge, Sand grouse, Duck and many other Hunts (allah ka shukar hay) I have not even ONCE experienced any kind of MALFUNCTION and it is very comfortable to shoot, specially when I shoulder the gun it  feels more livelier very durable as uptil now what I have seen in my short hunting carrier it is a gun made for high volume shooting and one more very distinctive characteristic is it handles the most variety of ammo loads starting from 24g to 55g without changing any part or any spring.\n\nLarge number of shot gunners consider the A390 the finest autoloader ever built by Beretta, but though it is a very good shotgun, but I believe a further improved version of that gun called the AL391 Teknys, which was introduced in 2002, is even better. It may not be better mechanically but it is much more refined and improved and meets all the requirement of the shooter standing in hunting field.\n\nAs far as I am considered the ONLY drawback in semi-auto’s is cleaning system, it takes at least half an hour for a person like me to clean the gun coz its Piston gets very dirty even after 25 shots.\n\nBeretta shotgun comes in a durable plastic storage case along with accessories such as four extra chokes and wrench, quick-detachable sling swivels, a bottle of Beretta oil, and, depending on the model, a spare butt plate or recoil pad.\n\n[B]Approximately:[/B] the price of this shotgun falls between Rs 200k to 240k (depending on a dealer to dealer or whether in Lahore and Karachi because Karachi is approximately 15 to 20k more expensive than Lahore \nAL 391 teknys Stone coat is just simply the BEST!

(48451, ' [quote=Skeeter60]\nBC  incorporates the caliber, bullet weight and sectional density as well as the form factor. It is a given  in the net and I am just simply repeating. Two bullets of different calibers and weight can have the same BC..[/quote]\n\nSir I,m adding to what you said above, in Chuck Hawks own words taken from fol site\n\n[url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/bc.htm[/url]\n\nBC is what determines trajectory and wind drift, other factors (velocity among them) being equal. BC changes with the shape of the bullet and the speed at which the bullet is traveling, while sectional density does not. Spitzer, which means pointed, is a more efficient shape than a round nose or a flat point. At the other end of the bullet, a boat tail (or tapered heel) reduces drag compared to a flat base. Both increase the BC of a bullet.\n\nFor example, a Hornady 100 grain round nose 6mm bullet has a BC of .216; a Hornady 100 grain spire point 6mm bullet has a BC of .357, and a Hornady 100 grain boat tail spire point 6mm bullet has a BC of .400. All three of these bullets have a sectional density (which is the ratio of a bullet''s diameter to its weight) of .242, because they are all .243" in diameter and weigh 100 grains. But the more streamlined bullets have a higher ballistic coefficient. They are the ones to choose for long range shooting where a flatter trajectory is important.\n\nTo illustrate the practical difference between these three styles of bullets, let''s use Hornady''s trajectory figures for the 100 grain 6mm bullets above. Starting all three bullets at a muzzle velocity of 3100 fps from a scoped 6mm rifle zeroed at 300 yards, the trajectories are as follows.\n\n.243" 100 grain Round Nose (BC .216): -1.5" @ muzzle, +4.8" @ 100 yards, +6" @ 200 yards, 0 at 300 yards, -15.9" @ 400 yards, -46" @ 500 yards.\n\n.243" 100 grain Spire Point (BC .357): -1.5" @ muzzle, +3.8" @ 100 yards, +4.7" @ 200 yards, 0 @ 300 yards, -11.1" @ 400 yards, -30.5" @ 500 yards.\n\n.243" 100 grain Spire Point BT (BC .400): -1.5" @ muzzle, +3.6" @ 100 yards, +4.4" @ 200 yards, 0 @ 300 yards, -10.4" @ 400 yards, -28.6" @ 500 yards.\n\nThere is a pretty big difference in trajectory between the round nose bullet and the two pointed bullets, making it obvious why it is folly to choose a round nose bullet for long range shooting with a high velocity rifle like a 6mm Remington or .243 Winchester. Also notice the big difference in BC between the round nose bullet (.216) and the spire point bullet (.357).\n \nSo what I want to add is that as mentioned by the honorable member Skeeter60 about different bullets having same BC, it is also true that same bullets (calibers) may also have different BC', ''),

(48596, ' Gents, I,m quoting excerpts from Mike Nelson article on Bullet Trajectory - Fact and Myths. It will further reinforce what the honorable Skeeter60 and probably other worthy members said above \n\nMyths and errors regarding the path of a bullet generally come from a lack of understanding of the forces acting on the bullet before, during, and after its path through the barrel.\n\nOne of the more pervasive myths associated with bullet trajectory is that "bullets always rise right after they leave the barrel." In general, bullets do rise after leaving the barrel, and they immediately begin to drop. This is not a contradiction, and the explanation is not difficult to understand.\n\nBullets are affected by gravity whether in flight or not, and, when they leave the barrel, they no longer have any physical support, such as the brass, the box, your pocket, the magazine, the chamber, or the barrel, so they begin to fall. In addition, they are traveling through air, so air resistance progressively slows their flight. On most occasions the barrel is slanted upward slightly to compensate for this immediate drop; thus, for all but extreme shots, since the barrel is aimed slightly upward, the bullet does, indeed, rise slightly after it leaves the barrel, but it bullet never rises above the axis of the barrel. (Just like a football generally rises above the player when they throw a pass. The longer the pass, the greater the starting angle, and the higher the "rise" before the ball begins to fall.)\n\nIn scientific terms, "thrown" objects, whether by hand, explosion, springs, compressed air, or other forces, are called "projectiles," their path in space is called their "trajectory," and the study of their trajectories is called "ballistics." Those who fail to understand the elementary physics of ballistics often misinterpret the configuration of barrel and the line of sight and assume that something "special" happens to the bullet during its flight. Many things happen, but nothing "special;" bullets fly just like any other projectile and are subject to the same laws of physics.\n\n\nHorizontal Shot. If the barrel is horizontal to the surface of the earth when fired, the bullet never rises above the barrel, and gravity causes an immediate descent.\n\n\nTypical Alignment. Generally, for what we consider a "horizontal" shot, the sight alignment places the barrel in a slightly upward tilt, and the bullet starts its arc, rises slightly above the level of the muzzle, but never above the axis of the barrel, reaches a peak, then descends.\n\n\nVelocity. The velocity is a factor in determining energy on impact and the horizontal velocity determines how far the bullet travels before it hits the ground. The above illustrations apply to all ballistic projectiles whether bullets, rocks, or ping pong balls.\n\nLow Velocity Bullets. Bullets at nominally 800 fps to perhaps 1600 fps, such as 22 LR, most pistols, and older rifle cartridges, must follow a rather high arc in order to reach a target 100 yards away. In fact, most of these slower cartridges are only useful to about 50 yards, perhaps 75 yards for some in the upper end of this range.\n\nHigh Velocity Bullets. Bullets at 2600 fps and up, such as the .223, 22-250, .243/6mm, .270, .308, 30-06, follow a much lower arc to reach a target, and their useful range can be upward of 200 yards. These are often referred to as "flatter" trajectories. With higher velocities, these bullets go much further before gravity and air resistance cause them to fall below the initial line of sight.\n\nSince the barrel is generally directed at an angle to the line of sight, sighting directly upward or directly downward results in a trajectory that deviates even more from the line of sight than the typical, relatively level shot. Still, the effects of gravity and air resistance are the same as far as the bullet is concerned, it is just that the trajectory at such a steep angle is more divergent from the line of sight.\n\nFact or Myth. So, does a bullet rise after it leaves the muzzle? One says, "yes." Another says, "no." Who is correct? Both could be correct because of different meanings associated with the word, "rise." They might argue incessantly, but their argument will not change the physical aspects of the path of the bullet. If they would concentrate on discussing the physical events, they would eventually conclude that they were each using the word, "rise," differently.', ''),

However, the high cost versus the standard 9 mm may mean widespread use is limited.

(48607, ' 1. Gents I would beg to differ with most of the members'' opinion about .22. While I,m not saying .22 is useless, it might have advantages like size, conceal carry etc,  it is certainly not the first choice for the purpose of Self Defense (SD) or Home Defense (HD). A weapon is selected for a purpose which it must fulfill, else the weapon choice is wrong. I would not like to go for deer hunting equipped with a 9mm (how good it may be) and would not prefer using a .270 or 30-06 or similar rifle for SD / HD. In my humble opinion following merits consideration:-\n a. A HD gun does not normally need to be carried on the person hence size is not really an important factor or an issue (Strength of .22)\nb. It puts your life and life of family members in danger if your shot does not stop the intruder on his heels. The stopping power of any handgun bullet turns out to be a function of its ability to disrupt vital bodily functions, not the diameter or weight or initial shape of the bullet that strikes the victim. For example, the difference in the size of the entrance hole made by a .451" bullet compared to that made by a .355" bullet in an elastic (semi-self sealing) material like skin turns out to be largely irrelevant to stopping power. The principle method of both stopping and killing with any firearm, whether rifle or pistol or shotgun, is the disruption of vital bodily functions. Fatally damage any animal''s heart, liver, lungs, or central nervous system and it is not going to live long enough to bleed out. Fail to put your bullet in a vital spot and you are very likely to have a problem with a man or an animal. That is not to say that some bullet placements might not eventually cause death by loss of blood, or infection, or some other mechanism, but that is never the goal of SD once you want an "Immediate One Shot Stop". 22 does not qualify this also. A well placed shot may do so but not a loose one. A bigger caliber with even less well placed shot possesses the potential to temporarily incapacitate the target and at least buy you time for a second shot.\nc. Another important factor in stopping power is of ammunition which you use. Well designed bullets (which includes most of the JHP pistol bullets now on the market) expand very reliably at their intended impact velocity. The famous 125 grain .357 JHP bullet, the most effective one shot stopper of all handgun loads, penetrates 13.25" in ordinance gelatin and produces a football shaped stretch cavity. This is how the very best bullets perform.\nd. One can keep a revolver loaded for months and months with out doing any damage to the springs etc. This is an advantage of revolvers over pistols.\ne. One does not go for a pitched battle in HD, and there is not a platoon size force attacking you. Hence the element of capacity is a matter of like or dislike therefore pistols'' edge of quick loading / reloading and high capacity magazines is not really relevant.\n\n2. Now it would be fair to conclude that an ordinary citizen like me who wants to keep a hand gun for HD would prefer a caliber capable of delivering sufficient power to the intruder, even if the shot is not well placed, capable of firing JHPs and is likely to be free of jams / problems like cartridge case stuck up etc. My choice is .357 Magnum Revolver. .22 to me is out :)\n3. But please remember a handgun can potentially save your life and the lives of your family. But it isn''t the weapon per-se that gets the job done, it is the person behind it. Skill and determination, reinforced by regular practice, will carry the day. Remember that, as Bill Jordan pointed out, there is no second place winner in a gunfight.\n4. Your turn Sirs', ''),

There will be no issue of cycling and failure to feed or ejection. You can buy a DA revolver capable of firing both .22lr and more powerful .22wmr. Everything will be fine including carrying chambered.\nNow, if you still want to buy a pistol i would recomend to go for Browning Buckmark or Ruger Mkiii . These are better guns and havent heard anything scary about their performance. Just try to use right kind  of ammo if there is any recomendation by the manufecturer(High velocity, Hyper velocity etc.). Try to find a brand and type of ammo by trial and error method that works flawlessly, there is always one even the gun is ammo sensitive. Never keep your mags loaded to the capacity for days. Give your mags some breathing period by rotating them. Always rotate your ammo too that you load in the mags. This will save soft .22lr shells from deforming that can result by remaining in continous compression. Keep your gun clean as blowback system is developed to work at lower energies and is prone to faults if not cared after use.', ''),

Got mugged twice and a couple of months ago had a big robbery at my place. was shattered!. I am a total newbie and have never used a handgun in my life. I have relatively SMALL HANDS and my budget for a handgun is Rs.25,000/ max. Pls guide me on what handgun to buy. Pls also guide me as I have a couple of more queries to ask all experts as I am very inexperienced .\n\n1) Should I buy a used REVOLVER, ARMINIUS OR TAURUS, used for 12-20K. I have heard that they are easy to operate, maintain and have few malfunctions. Or should I purchase a 30 bore pistol, 9 MM or what. I dont mind a Pakistani one which should not be too heavy. Pls advise.\n\n2) If I do purchase one (if I get a licence) where do I practice. Where do the experts practice and fire their rounds. I read from this forum that it is very dangerous to fire in the air and someone could get hurt. Now, the Karsaz range is also closed. Any suggestions. I know this is a naive question, buy guys pls help.\n\n3) How do u guys clean and maintain yr pistols. Is it hard?. Can I try it myself or give it to dealer to service/clean. How much do u think the dealers will charge for cleaning/servicing.\n\n4) As I am a total newbie, I was wondering if u all can let me know if there is a place/club or person who can teach me or aquaint me in how to load/unload, insert and eject a magazine, use safety features etc before I buy a pistol. I don''t mind paying for the instructions. Or if any of u members might be interested, i would love to familiarize myself with the working knowledge of pistols or revolvers. Thanks and again sorry for a silly question\n\n5) what is the procedure for selling a licenced firearm. If I sell my handgun to a dealear, will he endorse it on my licence?. Do I have to inform the DCO for the sale?. What about the PS?. Do I have to inform them also that I have sold my weapon so that they can update their records as well?\n\nSorry for all these questions, but if u all experts can provide some brief answers It would go a long way for me to make an informed decision reg purchase and handling.\n\nAwaiting yr quick reply guys\nthanks\nSD 26[/quote]\n1) Well if it is your first firearm and your range is limited to 25k, i would recommend you to buy a Chinese .30 tt. It is very easy to operate it and also very easy to maintain, it does not however have manual safeties on it.\n\n3) If you buy a .30 tt, it is very easy to clean and maintain it. You can learn dis-assembling your gun through watching tutorial videos over the net or you can also refer to the dealer to teach you to dis-assemble the weapon, for cleaning it is very easy because there is a variety of gun cleaner and lubricants available in the market to do the job, there are also certain 2 in 1 sprays that clean and at the same time lubricate the weapon also. And if you want the dealer to get it serviced, they charge a minimal of 100rs. to get the weapon oiled and cleaned. \n\n4) Well the basic rules of firearm handling are a must to be familiarize with, they are available at this forum and also over the net. Usually when you buy firearms from dealers you can explain them that it is your first firearm and they can help you in giving the basic knowledge that you need about the firearm, because if someone briefs you about his weapon and it is not the same one you are going to buy then, it would not be of any use because some pistols do not have safeties like the tt and the ones which have safeties, also differ from pistol to pistol.\n\n5) The procedure for selling your firearm is also very simple. If you are selling your firearm to a dealer or any other person, it is better that you go through a dealer. He will take the firearm from you and mention it on your license that, the particular dealer has bought the gun from you. Then you have to get a purchase period from the Dco, which will make the Dco aware that you have sold your weapon and now you need a time period to purchase a firearm. It is not important to inform the PS, the entry in the PS is only for the sake of records, to bring into their attention that a particular person holds a firearm.\n\nI hope this will answer most of your queries.', ''),

I''ll go see the dealer today to acsertain if other specimens of PT 809 are similar or there is something wrong with my pistol. I think the problem can be easily resolved by getting a slightly longer firing pin made.\n\nPS for Slayerjet: Brother it''ll be very difficult for me to join you at the GTG in Lahore.

Got mugged twice and a couple of months ago had a big robbery at my place. was shattered!. I am a total newbie and have never used a handgun in my life. I have relatively SMALL HANDS and my budget for a handgun is Rs.25,000/ max. Pls guide me on what handgun to buy. Pls also guide me as I have a couple of more queries to ask all experts as I am very inexperienced .\n\n1) Should I buy a used REVOLVER, ARMINIUS OR TAURUS, used for 12-20K. I have heard that they are easy to operate, maintain and have few malfunctions. Or should I purchase a 30 bore pistol, 9 MM or what. I dont mind a Pakistani one which should not be too heavy. Pls advise.\n\n2) If I do purchase one (if I get a licence) where do I practice. Where do the experts practice and fire their rounds. I read from this forum that it is very dangerous to fire in the air and someone could get hurt. Now, the Karsaz range is also closed. Any suggestions. I know this is a naive question, buy guys pls help.\n\n3) How do u guys clean and maintain yr pistols. Is it hard?. Can I try it myself or give it to dealer to service/clean. How much do u think the dealers will charge for cleaning/servicing.\n\n4) As I am a total newbie, I was wondering if u all can let me know if there is a place/club or person who can teach me or aquaint me in how to load/unload, insert and eject a magazine, use safety features etc before I buy a pistol. I don''t mind paying for the instructions. Or if any of u members might be interested, i would love to familiarize myself with the working knowledge of pistols or revolvers. Thanks and again sorry for a silly question\n\n5) what is the procedure for selling a licenced firearm. If I sell my handgun to a dealear, will he endorse it on my licence?. Do I have to inform the DCO for the sale?. What about the PS?. Do I have to inform them also that I have sold my weapon so that they can update their records as well?\n\nSorry for all these questions, but if u all experts can provide some brief answers It would go a long way for me to make an informed decision reg purchase and handling.\n\nAwaiting yr quick reply guys\nthanks\nSD 26[/quote]\n1) Well if it is your first firearm and your range is limited to 25k, i would recommend you to buy a Chinese .30 tt. It is very easy to operate it and also very easy to maintain, it does not however have manual safeties on it.\n\n3) If you buy a .30 tt, it is very easy to clean and maintain it. You can learn dis-assembling your gun through watching tutorial videos over the net or you can also refer to the dealer to teach you to dis-assemble the weapon, for cleaning it is very easy because there is a variety of gun cleaner and lubricants available in the market to do the job, there are also certain 2 in 1 sprays that clean and at the same time lubricate the weapon also. And if you want the dealer to get it serviced, they charge a minimal of 100rs. to get the weapon oiled and cleaned. \n\n4) Well the basic rules of firearm handling are a must to be familiarize with, they are available at this forum and also over the net. Usually when you buy firearms from dealers you can explain them that it is your first firearm and they can help you in giving the basic knowledge that you need about the firearm, because if someone briefs you about his weapon and it is not the same one you are going to buy then, it would not be of any use because some pistols do not have safeties like the tt and the ones which have safeties, also differ from pistol to pistol.\n\n5) The procedure for selling your firearm is also very simple. If you are selling your firearm to a dealer or any other person, it is better that you go through a dealer. He will take the firearm from you and mention it on your license that, the particular dealer has bought the gun from you. Then you have to get a purchase period from the Dco, which will make the Dco aware that you have sold your weapon and now you need a time period to purchase a firearm. It is not important to inform the PS, the entry in the PS is only for the sake of records, to bring into their attention that a particular person holds a firearm.\n\nI hope this will answer most of your queries.[/quote]\n\nThanks Osam for replying to my queries. I appreciate it. You mentioned to me that for the first time it is better to buy TT30 Chinese make. Is this a reliable weapon compared to the Beretta 92FS clone?. What if I buy ther Beretta clone. will it be too heavy for me or too complicated to handle for a person who is handling a firearm for the very first time?. Also, I heard it weighs close to  1 kilo. Will the weight be a detterent in shooting accurately, and would it have MORE recoil than a Chinese TT?.\n\nIs it better to BUY A GUN WITH SAFETIES rather than buy a pistol without one like the TT30 Chinese?. How will a handgun (pistol) with safety help me?.\n\nWhat is yr opinion for a very first timer for buying a gun like CF98 or NP 22 ny Norinco.Would it be easier to handle, or same like the Chinese TT 30?.\n\nLast question. I know it may sound stupid. Where do I practice my shooting?. What place would u recommend, if I do not have access to a Firing Range like Karsaz?. Pls yr views.\n\nAppreciate yr quick and valuable views.\nthanks,\nrgds,\nSD 26', ''),

Thats a million dollar question. My all hunter colleagues practice exactly the same what  you mentioned. Takbeer and shoot. Collect the prey and slaughter even if dead. Slaughtering is more of a ritual. Somehow I believe that unless a bird or an animal is slaughtered in ALLAH''s name with blood (even a single drop) coming out of its neck it is MAKRUH, else halal. But I think it is more to do with your belief than hunting etiquette. Saying more than this may hurt somebody,s feeling. The lighter part is that many years ago as a young boy once I went with my father for Urial hunt near Kallar Kahar. I asked our village''s Imam Masjid about it. He very confidently said yes it is HALAL but if you miss the shot "to tumhara nikah toot jai ga". On my querry that I am unmarried (then) he got puzzled and then said "phir bhee toot jai ga".

Few day back i want to a Daudsons in BankRoad Sadar Rawapindi and had check this Escort 7+1 mag capacity that was a good one with not much of the weight so good for home defense and he was offered me for 27k .  So i think you should check about its price form one or two more dealers As we all know that Lahore prices are a bit lesser then Pindi/Islamabad.\n\nWish you best of luck.   and Do give me your feedback when you will experienced this gun personally as i am also thinking of to get this gun when i will get my license.[/quote]\n\nthanks for your kind wishes brother!\n\nYes, I agree that we can get the escort a bit cheaper in Lahore because 30k was just the demand. I think if once I''m in the situation to buy the weapon, I will insist on paying somewhere around 25k. And I think they are also giving a reasonable rate on Shaheen ammo. 800/box for ....

If you catch up with it when it is still alive, it is essential that you slaughter it properly. \n\n[b]Question\n[/b]\n\n"Are the birds that we shoot with rifles and they died halaal or not? We find that some birds that we shoot have died before we can say the name of Allaah over them."\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, if you shoot a rifle when hunting birds or rabbits or deer, and you say the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger, then it will be halaal, even if you find it already dead, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he said: “If you release your (hunting) dog and mention the name of Allaah over it, then eat.” But if it is still alive and able to move then you must slaughter it properly and mention the name of Allaah over it when slaughtering it. If you do not do that and it dies, then it becomes haraam for you. But attention must be paid to mentioning the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger, because if you do not mention the name of Allaah then it is haraam to eat it, even if you forget, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he said: “Do not eat of that over which the name of Allaah has not been mentioned.” End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb. \n\n\n[b]Question\n[/b]\n"Is it sufficient for me to say Bismillaah wa Allaahu akbar when inserting bullets into the rifle when hunting, or must I mention the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger of the rifle?"\n\n[b]Answer\n[/b]\n\n What you must do is mention the name of Allaah when shooting, and it is not sufficient to mention the name of Allaah when putting the bullets into the rifle, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When you shoot your arrow, then mention the name of Allaah” (saheeh – agreed upon, from the hadeeth of ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allaah be pleased with him); this version was narrated by Muslim).

The words ‘Do not take anything in which there is a soul as a target’ means [b]do not use living animals as targets for shooting as targets made of leather and so on are used.[/b] This prohibition means that doing this is haraam. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar which follows this report: “Allaah cursed the one who does that.” And because it is torturing animals, a waste of their [animals’] lives, a waste of money, causing the animal to die without slaughtering it in the proper Islamic manner if it is an animal whose meat may be eaten, and wasting an animal from which benefit may be derived in other ways if it is an animal whose meat may not be eaten.', ''),

[/quote]\n\nSir i think it is a local use for 7.62x25Tokarev. As we all know there is nothing any thing like 30bore pistol or rifle. It is just for the shotguns that .....Gauge is used to describe the classification of the gun, based only on the size of the hole. For rifles and pistols it is not simply the diameter of the bullet or bore of the barrel that completly descibe the type of the rifle or pistol.\nFor example 7.62x25Tokarev, 7.62x39 and 7.62x51NATO all are .30 Caliber. Can we call them all 30bore and still understand the type and power of the weapon. Certainly not,  so rifle and pistol cartridges are described differently either by mentioning length of the shell after the diameter of the projectile like 7.62x39, where 7.62mm is diameter and 39mm is the length of the shell, Or putting the name of the bullet(mostly copany''s nam that developed the bullet) along the diameter of the bullet e.g .40S&W, .45ACP, .38SPL etc.', ''),

(49781, ' Handgun shooting tips \n[b]\nAlways warm up[/b]\nIt is amazing how many pistol shooters begin a competition shoot without ‘getting their eye in’. Try to do some shooting just before competing, as the body needs time and practice in order to tune in to the task.\n[b]\nGo back to the basics[/b]\nIt is important to always be mindful of the basic principles that underpin good shooting technique, namely grip, stance, breathing, sight alignment, trigger release and follow through. Bad habits are like weeds - they begin unnoticed, but will gradually get a stranglehold on the elements of good technique if not kept in check. This is why it is so important - particularly to shooters who are not coached - to regularly self assess by checking their basic technical skills.\n[b]\nPractise dry firing[/b]\nNothing hides a technical fault better than a loud bang, a flash and a jumping muzzle. The accuracy of your shot will always be determined by the position of the gun at the exact moment of firing. The things that will generally destroy this are poor trigger technique and flinch. Regrettably, many shooters fail to improve their scores because of critical moment gun movement. The most effective way to cure and control this issue is, firstly, to practise dry firing as part of your training regime. As a guide, I would recommend that you actually do more dry firing than live firing at a practice session.\n[b]\nCheck for flinch[/b]\nRegularly check for flinch by having a partner load your gun for you - so that you do not know whether you will be pulling the trigger on a live round or a dummy. This is a tried and proven technique that is under-employed in many training schedules.\n\n[b]Select a pistol that fits your hand properly[/b]\nUnfortunately, many shooters will fall into the trap of getting a gun that they like the look of, but which is a poor fit in their hand. Regrettably, not all gun styles fit all hands so it is important to prioritise one’s shooting needs before making a purchase. The stock of the gun will need to nestle into the hand so that the grip is comfortable and has no pressure points. It is very important that the index finger be positioned to allow an accurate and controlled movement when actuating the trigger.\n[b]\nCorrect grip[/b]\nThe gun must be held so that its long axis lines up pretty well with the axis of the forearm, but will still allow sufficient extension of the finger to allow a straight trigger pull. If the wrist needs to be bent around the gun to allow the index finger to access the trigger, this generally means that the gun is too big for the hand. This follows on from the previous tip, in that some gun/hand combinations will simply not allow correct grip to be established and, in such cases, the combination will be less than optimum for good shooting.\n[b]\nHold the gun tight[/b]\nHold the gun tight but not so much as to affect circulation. A correctly fitting grip will make it very easy to hold the gun tight and control recoil.\n[b]\nTrigger control[/b]\nThis is one of the most important aspects of shooting technique. The trigger should be eased back in a gentle, continuous motion. It should never be snapped or jerked. A shooter who is familiar with his or her gun will, from experience, be aware of the exact force needed to release the mechanism. In preparation for the shot, about 50 to 70 per cent of this force should already be on the trigger. When the mechanism lets go, the finger should be as close as possible to 90 degrees to the surface of the trigger.\n[b]\nFollow through[/b]\nThere is always a small amount of time between the trigger mechanism letting go and the bullet exiting the barrel. The hammer must fall upon the firing pin, which must depress the primer and then ignite the powder, which will burn and create the expanding gas that drives the bullet. Any movement during this period must be kept to a minimum (ideally zero). This is why it is so important to discipline yourself not to move a muscle until the bullet has passed through the target. This is commonly known as follow through.\n[b]\nLet the trigger move[/b]\nfully forward at the same speed as you pressed it. After you have fired the shot and paused for the follow through, allow the trigger to slowly return to its unfired position. Do this at the same speed as you originally pressed it. Performing this task will further assist you to hold the gun still before firing.\n[b]\nBe consistent in your shooting[/b]\nAccuracy walks hand-in-hand with consistency. Try to be as consistent as possible with things such as how you raise the gun to the target, how you establish your sight picture and how long it takes to settle and discharge the shot. Also try to keep the physical conditions constant, such as barrel temperature (this is controlled to some extent by the time between shots) and type of ammunition.\n\n[b]Correct breathing[/b]\nThis is traditionally one of the hardest skills to master. Normal breathing will cause enough movement to disturb the sight picture. The trick is not to think too much about breathing, because, quite often, the more we think about something, the more we allow it to disturb our concentration. Try to establish a cycle where the breath is momentarily held just before and just after the shot. This will in no way disturb the natural balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in our bloodstream.', ''),
(49782, ' The Wheel of Misfortune\n\nEvery day of the shooter''s life brings a new lesson. Identifying errors are crucial in order that these lessons be learned. The following chart can help pinpoint such basic flaws in a shooter''s technique by analyzing group locations. As printed, it is for a right-handed shooter. (A left-hander''s chart would be mirrored horizontally.)\n\n[b]Top Eleven Bad Habits of Shooters[/b]\n1. Not Looking at the Sights. This quite frequently is listed as "looking at the target." A shooter may be focusing his eye on neither the sights nor the target, but since he does not see the target in clear focus he assumes he is looking at the sights. You must concentrate on sight alignment.\n2. Holding Too Long. Any adverse conditions that interrupt a shooter''s ability to "hold" will cause him to delay his squeeze, waiting for conditions to better. The disturbing factor about this is that you will do it unconsciously; therefore, you must continuously ask yourself, am I being too particular?\n3. Improper Grip or Position. Suffice to say that you cannot fire a decent score with any gun at any range if you continually change your grip or position.\n4. Jerk or Heel. The application of pressure either with the trigger finger alone or in case of the heel, pushing with the heel of the hand at the same time. Apply pressure to the trigger straight to the rear and wait for the shot to break.\n5. Anticipation. Anticipation can cause muscular reflexes of an instant nature that so closely coincide with recoil that extreme difficulty is experienced in making an accurate call. Anticipation is also the sire to flinching.\n6. Loss of Concentration. If the shooter fails in his determination to apply positive pressure on the trigger while concentrating on the front sight his prior determination needs renewal and he should rest and start over.\n7. Anxiety. You work and work on a shot, meanwhile building up in your mind doubt about the shot being good. Finally you shoot just to get rid of that particular round so you may work on the others.\n8. Vacillation (Plain Laziness). This is a mental fault more than a physical one, which results in your accepting minor imperfections in your performance which you could correct if you worked a little harder. The end result being you hope you get a good shot. Just like you hope you will get a gratis tax refund, and you will get one just about as frequently as you get the other.\n9. Lack of Follow Through. Follow through is the subconscious attempt to keep everything just as it was at the time the shot broke. In other words you are continuing to fire the shot even after it is gone. Follow through is not to be confused with recovery. Merely recovering and holding on the target after the shot is no indication that you are following through.\n10. Lack of Rhythm. Hesitancy on the first shot or any subsequent shot in timed or rapid fire. Develop a good rhythm and then have the fortitude to employ it every case. Frequently many shooters will have fine rhythm until the last shot of a string and then hesitate, doctoring up that last shot.\n11. Match Pressure. If there are 200 competitors in a match, rest assured that there are 200 shooters suffering from match pressure. So what makes you think you are so different? If you are exerting all your mental energy toward executing the correct fundamentals rather than the arithmetic evaluation, your shooting match pressure will be what you feel when people congratulate you on a fine performance.', ''),

Patton once called the famed M1 Garand "the greatest battle implement ever devised," a claim few disputed at the time and some believe still holds true today. Were he to have acquainted himself with the M-14 rifle, with its 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge, improved gas system, flash hider, and detachable magazine he may well have revised his statement. The Norinco M-14S is a semi-auto copy of the famed M-14 any Canadian with a firearms license can own.\n\nThe one problem with this design has been its price: its American-made entry-level counterpart costs in excess of $2,000 Canadian. To make matters worse our competition charges $700.00 for the Norinco M-14S (aka. ''M-305'') - three hundred dollars MORE per rifle - and refuses to offer any warranty on them (Marstar does provide a written warranty with all Norinco firearms we sell: see below for details).

(49882, ' @Tauras\nAn excellant post.\nI want to add \nSurprise Break. Bravely squeeeeze the trigger ,you should not anticipate the shot. This will prevent involuntary movement of some muscle throwing the shot off. The surprise break will be without induced errors. This should be irrespective of alignment with the target, the triggering error is the major culprit.Little mis alignment with the target causes very small errors.\n\nHold your breath before firing. Proper breathing technique for target shooting should be followed.\n\nIn  deliberate aimed  shooting try to release the shot within 5 seconds or a max of 7 seconds. The longer you take the more your concentration, breath control and  stability of hands deteriorates.\n\nMake a position with feet as wide as your shoulders and in case of single hand shooting anchor your free hand don''t let it dangle like a pendolum. Put it in your pocket or hook the thumb in the belt or trouser. \nYou should face the target at an angle which suits your body type, in case of two hand shooting face the target squarely lightly push out with your gun hand and pull in with your non shooting hand.\n\nIn target shooting inhale and exhale deeply and then take a comfortable breath and hold it before firing the shot and release after shooting.\n\nFollow Through\nAfter firing a shot do not rush to see where your shot went, stay frozen, for a second or two and then gradually recover into shooting stance. Follow through is extremely important, in case of a cricket bat , a tennis racket, a hockey if you change the angle of swing after hitting the ball the trajectory follows it as some muscles guide the ball prior to hitting. Similarly a bullet will be effected if you do not freeze for a little while after shooting, the bullet is still in the barrel or about to be fired when your relaxing the grip or lack of follow through effects it.\nA typist first develops accurate typing and then speed, similarly first learn the basics and then build speed. The above are for deliberate Target Shooting which can later be developed for combat/ speed shooting', ''),

Seperate the wood and metal as much as possible and seal them well.\nThe most common use of cosmoline is the storage and preservation of firearms.

It is always brown in color, and can differ in viscosity and shear strength. Cosmoline melts at 130-150 °F (45–52 °C) and has a flashpoint of 365 °F (185 °C).\nDuring World War II, US Coast Artillerymen (serving the huge coastal artillery batteries) were known as "Cosmoliners" because they were tasked with the near constant cosmoline application ("greasing down") of the guns.During Pacific island campaigns in World War II, the United States Marines sang a song about Cosmoline. Adapting the popular big-band tune "Tangerine," they would sing "Cosmoline...keeps my rifle clean."\nAn someone told me that Pakistan Army also use casmoline to clean or preserve their firearms.

These are animals belonging to the cat families such as lion, tiger, cats, dogs, wolfs, hyenas, etc.\n(ii) Certain rodents like mice, rats, rabbits with claws, etc.\n(iii) Certain reptiles like snakes, alligators, etc.\n(iv) Birds of prey with talons or claws, like vultures, eagle, crows, owl, etc.\n\nSayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him eternal peace) said: “Two types of dead meat and two types of blood have been made lawful for our consumption: The two dead meats are: fish and locust, and the two types of blood are: liver and spleen.” (Sunan Abu Dawud, Musnad Ahmad and Sunan Ibn Majah)', ''),

(50107, ' [quote=hasnaincfa]I think first clean fiream thoroughly, then apply cosmoline to all metal parts. Seperate the wood and metal as much as possible and seal them well.\nThe most common use of cosmoline is the storage and preservation of firearms. Objects the size of entire vehicles could be preserved for future use with cosmoline.\nChemically, cosmoline is a homogeneous mixture of oily and waxy long-chain, non-polar hydrocarbons. It is always brown in color, and can differ in viscosity and shear strength. Cosmoline melts at 130-150 °F (45–52 °C) and has a flashpoint of 365 °F (185 °C).\nDuring World War II, US Coast Artillerymen (serving the huge coastal artillery batteries) were known as "Cosmoliners" because they were tasked with the near constant cosmoline application ("greasing down") of the guns.During Pacific island campaigns in World War II, the United States Marines sang a song about Cosmoline. Adapting the popular big-band tune "Tangerine," they would sing "Cosmoline...keeps my rifle clean."\nAn someone told me that Pakistan Army also use casmoline to clean or preserve their firearms. But he told that the drawback of casmoline is due to its gelatinous nature cosmoline can  difficult to remove completely from firearms and some other chemical is used to remove it.[/quote]\n\n\nyes! brother, cosmoline was one option that we discussed but with cosmoline preservation we run into three problems.\n\n1. not available in the market\n2. application is very difficult as the military dips the firearms in a tub of melted cosmoline\n3. removal is very difficult and usually a full time job requiring hot water or some kind of solvent in large quanitities.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Bullet seated way much inside the case is another ammo related issue resulting in excess pressure levels.\n\nRound is out of battery. that is, the round is not fully inserted in chamber, meaning slide is not fully closed. This is a rare case and is more pistol design dependant. e.g a 92FS cannot fire unless slide is not fully locked with locking blocks held in locking position, because the hammer doesnt fall fully unless the said condition is fullfilled.\n\nSo incase of a GRACH Kb! you should not only see ammunition or supportiveness of chamber, there can be other reasons as mentioned above.', ''),

I happened to unpack them to have a look on the old weaponry. I was amazed to see they were in No.1 condition, literally no RUST and no signs of corrosion. They were thoroughly bathed in simple mustard oil.\n\nI would like to add here that these guns were unpacked cleaned and oiled several times during this time period, however using the mustard oil had gunked up guns quite a bit. \nSo please dont use mustard oil .. :) Last time my Mamu, unpacked them and oiled them, he did it again with mustard oil as it was an instruction of grand dad and its meant to be followed anyway...[/quote]\n\n\nhmm..... wraping the guns in plastic bags and sealing them. this could work. infact this idea seems like the most workable one. however greasing the gun will mean that at the end of the storage period cleaning would be a difficult task. i''m sorta looking for a storage technique where at the end of the storage period the guns come out fully functional and without mandatory cleaning/dusting necessary.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(50211, ' wait a minute!\n\nmidreestaj''s idea can be expanded a bit. instead using plastic bags (which do transmitt moisture) and bags sealed only by tape (which also transmitts moisture) how about we just oil the gun as it is normally oiled and seal the gun in HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE bag, vaccum sealed. this is ensure the gun stays moisture free till then end of the storage period and when u do need the gun, just tear open the HDPE bag.\n\nnow, if i''m not wrong since we want 0% moisture transmission we would have to restrict our choice to HDPE only and with minimum film thickness of 100 microns (0.1mm). this should do the job.\n\nregular plastics, PVC, LDPE are all inferior to HDPE in moisture barrier role. another benefit of HDPE over other types of polymers is that it is relatively stable and not effected by solvents, oils and chemicals. another plus since we''ll be storing the firearms all oiled up.\n\nnow the other tricky part: [b]where to get custom sized HDPE bags of 100 micron film thickness?[/b]\n\nRegards', ''),

An English SxS Side lock Birmingham and economical London Jeffery, Cogswel and Harrison,William Evans etc gun will fetch around 200K+/-, a spanish Aya2 can be an economical option in Side lock. One shouls be very careful while purchasing a used english gun, please check the proof marks and cross check them from the net.\n\nSir, all O/U by Beretta come with wooden furniture. All these guns come on one time tested basic platform that is 687, so, when we buy either 687 silver pigeon S (the entry level model) or the 687 EELL Diamond Pigeon (The premium model) we get the same 687 platform.

We travel by sea and we do not carry much fresh water with us so if we do wudu with it we go thirsty. Can we do wudu with seawater?" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, replied, "lts water is pure, and its dead creatures are halal."\n(The Hadith is also reported in Abu Daud, Tirmidi, Nisai)\n\nExplaination according to Imam-e- Zarqani...\ni am translating from an urdu version book so plz excuse my grammar!!\n\n"Although the questioner had asked about sea water. But the Prophet(s.a.w)  mentioned about sea food too because as there is scarcity of water sometime there is scarcity of food too. The words in hadith [b]"and its dead creatures are halal."[/b]  meaning thereby all animals who live in sea, who cannot survive without water they all are halal. Even it doesn''t resemble a fish in shape but a dog or a pig.\nAccording to Imam Abu Hanifa (r.a) in this Hadith the wording [b]"dead creatures"[/b] means fish only and not other sea animals. But there is no authentic argument to this statement and this is  [b]Hadith mutlaq[/b].\n Imam Zarqani says that this hadith lays down a big principle of Islam. All imams have accepted it and the scholar (Aima salasa) agreed to it in every era. The hadith is reported by well known imams like imam malik,shafi,ahmad,tirmidi,nisai,ibne majah,abu daud, daruqtani,baihiqi and hakim.

Subsonic bullets do not cross the sound barrier during their flight so are not prone to the shock waves of sound barier. At the same time we must not forget that it is not just the velocity of a bullet that determines the accuracy but BC(Ballistic Coeffecient),weight, spin, shape all are very important. Has accuracy been the inversely related function of velocity, the .17Mach2 would have been very inaccurate as compared to .22LR, but the fact is  not so. \n\nA bullet is needed to be accurate and effective too. So, we need accuracy, range and hitting power(energy which is function of mass and velocity). To harness more range and energy(hitting or killing power) we need heavier or faster, or both, bullets that are good fliers(high BC). At the same time recoil of the gun is also a function of mass and velocity. You increase weight of the bullet by 10%, the recoil will increase by 20% same is the case with velocity. To reduce felt recoil you increase the weight of the gun by 10% felt recoil will reduce by 10%.', ''),

These are built like a tank and extremely accurate and would consume any diet of .22 ammo without a hitch.\nYou''ll have to clean every 500 to 1000 rds. These are in destruct able pistols.\nSecond is the Browning buck mark. Both guns are as accurate as Target pistols like the Walther GSP Expert,the Hammerli SP 20 or the Pardini.\nI would recommend any of the above three if you want to move on to Competition shooting, these are serious shooting pistols and the plastic guns are really like toys compared to these', ''),

(50476, ' Kabooms are results of excessive pressure levels build up inside a firearm.. for which following can be reasons:\n\ncase failure/rupture for which unsupported chamber is one suspected cause. much of which we heard in .40S&W Glock22/23.\n\nBarrel obstructions of any sort, even lead fouling in excess, can make it happen, that is why polygonal rifled barrels are not recommended for lead cast bullets as they gather up lead inside them faster than conventional rifling. \n\nAmmo problem, like way too less powder/charge inside the case.. this results not in proper burning of powder, rather it ends up in DETONATION! a faulty factory piece or faulty handload. Bullet seated way much inside the case is another ammo related issue resulting in excess pressure levels.\n\nRound is out of battery. that is, the round is not fully inserted in chamber, meaning slide is not fully closed. This is a rare case and is more pistol design dependant. e.g a 92FS cannot fire unless slide is not fully locked with locking blocks held in locking position, because the hammer doesnt fall fully unless the said condition is fullfilled.\n\nSo incase of a GRACH Kb! you should not only see ammunition or supportiveness of chamber, there can be other reasons as mentioned above.', ''),

(50488, ' [quote=Denovo87]Very usefull info indeed, but I am not convinced with the .22 hornet''s energy??? how can it be equal to .357 mag ?[/quote]\n\nsir, as you know Energy is calculated in Joules:\n\n- It depends on the mass and velocity of projectile. \n\nIt has a very simple formula:   \nEnergy of projectile = 1/2 x Mass of projectile x (Velocity of projectile''s)Square\n(mass is taken in Kilograms and Velocity in Meter/second)\n\nFor an example take a Hornet projectile of 55 grain moving over a velocity of 2600 feet/seconds which it usually does, and put the values in the formula:\nYou get energy of .22 Hornet as 1100 Joules or 850 Foot Pounds approx.\n\nIncase of 357mag, moving a 125 grainer over 1600 feet/seconds, translating it directly to kinetic energy becomes 960 Joules or 710 Foot-Pounds approx\n\nPlease note that the tremendous gain in velocity of .22 hornet over a 357mag gives it more kinetic energy at muzzle. So here a 22 becomes more powerful than a 357 :)\n\nNOTE: In firearms world, power of a weapon is usually explained in Foot-Pounds rather than Joules which is more of a traditional energy meter. \n\nEnergy once calculated in joules can be converted to Foot-Pounds by a special multiple: \ni.e. 1 Foot-Pound is 1.355 joules approx.\n\nLittle about Foot Pound in layman terms can be explained as it is a function of force in MOTION. i.e IF 1 pound of force is in a motion, and yet it moves to 1 foot distance, then the work done is 1 Foot-Pound.', ''),

OR any body or material that has fluid constituents in it. It is disruption of bodily fluids upon penetration from an ultra high velocity projectile. Well these velocities are normally in excess of 2000 Feet per Seconds, causing huge wound channels and bigger permanent and also bigger temporary wound channels inside the body of the target.\n\nYou can very well imagine a .22 projectile of sufficient mass i.e. of 55 grains such as in Hornet''s case zipping off your middle mass, in excess of sizzling 2600 FPS. It would devastate your abdomen region ending up literally in an ''opened up abdomen area'' prooved DEADLY!! Far more than what a 357mag will do at the similar distances.', ''),

Long as the ducks are coming in, forget calling.\n2    When the ducks start an erratic wing beat, hit them with a comeback call immediately to bring them back on line.\n3.   If they look as if they may drift off-line, use single quacks and feed calls to bring them back online.\n4.   Try calling at birds as they circle when they quarter into the wind. This will make it easier for them to set up for a landing zone into the wind.  (Anticipate their swing).\n5.   Remember your whistle and mix these sounds in with your mallard call. Youngsters can blow these with ease and feel partly r      esponsible   for bringing the ducks in! The mallard drake sound should not be discounted either, especially on windless days!\n6.   Always start high and come down the scale smoothly with no "start-up note."\n7.   If possible use a call that applies to the species you''re trying to call. Speak their language ( blue-wing teal, use a blue-wing call).\n8.   When team calling, one person should be the leader while the others just fill in. Don''t compete against yourselves.\n9.   Realize that not all ducks are callable and that even real ducks do not call in all the ducks all the time.\n10. Be different! If what you are doing isn''t working…CHANGE. Don''t get stuck in a rut!\n\nDon''t wait, put these points into practice today and be ready to enjoy the current game season.\n\nVery best regards for my all hunters of Pakistan.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', ''),

(50637, ' My Dear Hunters,\n\nI am posting here some very best calling tips especially for new commers as  duck shooters. I am trying define best calling in very an easy way. These all tims are in my practice since long time, I prepared for my clients first and now I am publishing here only for the benefits of my domestic hunters belongs to Pakistan.\n\n\nThere are eight calls every serious duck hunter should have in his or her repertoire. Learn these, and you will be able to bring ducks closer in nearly every hunting situation. \n\nKnow Your Calls\n\nBasic Quack\nAs easy as it sounds, some callers never master a basic quack, and then wonder why the ducks don''t come into their spread. The importance of learning to end the quack. "One of the first thing. People use ''qua qua qua'' when there needs to be a clean, crisp, ''quacK'' instead. Stick to the basics and end your quacks, and everything else is second.\n\nGreeting Call\n"I use the greeting call when I first see ducks at a distance. It''s a series of 5 to 7 notes in descending order at a steady even rhythm, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc," \n\nFeed Call \nFor a basic feeding call, say "tikkitukkatikka," into the call raising and lowering the volume slightly. "I don''t feed call a lot," says three-time World Champion caller and call maker Mike McLemore. "Callers should learn to use it to add variety, but it sounds better to the caller than it does to the ducks.  Most mallards I hear feed calling in the typical ''kitty, kitty, kitty'' fashion are flying, while ducks feeding are more broken up and erratic sounding, like ''da-dit da-dit dit dit, da-dit dit.''" \n\nHail Call\nThe hail or highball call is an overused call in the minds of the pros. "Don''t use a highball within 100 yards of the ducks. But when you do use it, blow high, hard, and loud. Try to sound as natural as you can." If you decide to try your hail call, start with a long, strong, Aaaaaaink...Aaaaaink.., aaaaink, aaainkaink and taper off as it progresses. But remember to use the hail call sparingly, "If the ducks are coming in, forget calling."\n\nComeback Call\n"The comeback call is used when ducks don''t respond to your greeting or you want an immediate response, such as in timber. It''s more urgent sounding and faster, like Kanckanc, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc,". Also, I have found live ducks only call to others after they have flown over the pond or passed their location. Usually she''ll give them only one comeback call." Just remember that a comeback call is fast and hard, with about 5 to 7 notes. Don''t overcomplicate it.\n\nThe duck(hen) is an often overlooked call that can be very effective, especially when ducks are call-shy. The call is nothing more than widely spaced, irregular, nasal, drawn-out Quaaaaink quacks. \n\nSome callers have used it to pull birds sitting on the water for long distances. "You can derive your lonesome hen call from your basic quack. Learn to quack correctly and the rest will come from that, Your call should be spaced out, and quick, with several seconds between. If the quacks are too close together it scares the ducks. And keep in mind that the hen is somewhat low and throaty."\n\nPleading Call\n"The pleading or begging hail call is used to get the attention of ducks flying 75 to 200 yards above you. This call is a series of 5 t o 6 quacks that are really dragged out to sound like you are begging the ducks to land. A pleading call is a Kaaanc, Kanc, Kanc, Kanc sound, and its first note is usually held a little longer. The pleading call is a drawn-out, slightly faster variation of the comeback. Many callers save the pleading call for stubborn ducks that refuse to come in. It''s the caller''s way of literally pleading with the ducks to come into or return to the spread.\n\nWhistling (Mallard, Pintail and Wigeon)\nWhistling works!  swears by a whistle. "Most of our most successful hunts last year were late in the season using whistles in conjunction with our mallard calls. We try to identify the ducks before we call to them so that we can speak their language," he says. "Whistles are also a great way to get youngsters involved in hunting, because there''s no way they can mess it up."\n\nI hope that all my Pakguns.co. fellows will enjoy these calling methods for good duck shooting result.\n\nBest regards.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', ''),

(50696, ' The Houbara Bustard is 60 cm long with an 140 cm wingspan. It is brown above and white below, with a black stripe down the sides of its neck. In flight, the long wings show large areas of black and brown on the flight feathers. It is slightly smaller and darker than Macqueen''s Bustard. The sexes are similar, but the female is smaller and greyer above.\n\nThe Houbara Bustard is facing increasing threat of extinction due to excessive hunting, poaching and encroachments on its habitat, experts said.This migratory bird arrives every year in Pakistan in November and December from Mongolia, Siberia and central Asian republics. According to a study, its population is rapidly declining in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, India, UAE and Middle East countries.\n\nThe Asian Houbara could be extinct within 15 to 25 years if unchecked hunting, illegal trapping and trading of the bird continued at the existing scale, said the study conducted by the Environment Research and Wild life Development Agency (ERWDA). ERWDA estimated that the natural death rate of the bird was 3.28 percent while death due to hunting accounted for more than 73 percent. The rate of hunting has reached nearly 20.8 percent, dangerously exceeding the acceptable 7.2 percent.\n\nBecause of the increased hunting of the bird, especially in its winter habitats, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has classified it as an endangered migratory bird. The Houbara Bustard is also listed in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, which is known as the Bonn Convention. The World Conservation Union has put it in the ‘Near Threatened’ category.\n\n“If the present situation continues, the number of these birds will be reduced by 50 percent by 2015 and they could be extinct by 2027,” the study said. “There is a gradual decrease in the number of Houbara birds coming to Pakistan each year,” Dr Mumtaz Malik, the chief conservator Wildlife, NWFP, said.\n\nRivalry between the Houbara’s newborns is also one of the factors in their decrease, he said. “The Houbara gives birth to only two offspring a year but the elder one kills the younger sibling due to the fear of having to share food,” Dr Mumtaz said. According to Dr Mumtaz, the enthusiasm of NGOs interested in preserving the endangered species has been on the decline.\n\nLt Col Shams Ernest, spokesman of the Houbara Bustard International Foundation (HBIF), Lahore, said that all arid areas in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan were the Houbara’s winter habitat.\n\n“The bird is being artificial bred in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. But it has to be done under extremely controlled conditions and is very expensive,” he said. This desert bird migrates to Pakistan in winter and leaves in April and May, said Yar Muhammad Khan, a former official of NWFP Wildlife, Fisheries and Forests Department. Covering a distance of about 4,500 to 5,000 kilometres, the Houbara journeys from central Asia and Siberia at altitudes of 300 to 500 feet and lands in Bahawalpur, Rahimyar Khan and the arid areas of Sindh and Balochistan, Khan said. The bird eats flora, insects and earthworms. “The Houbara is very sensitive and does not use the same route again if it senses any danger on its way during the first journey. If the Houbara looses its mate, it takes three to five years to find a new one,” Khan said. The bird travels in groups with one chief. If they loose their chief, the deputy guides the group to its destination. “Approximately 500 to 2,000 Houbara are trapped each year with the help of falcons, nets and other means in the arid areas of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan. If the hunting continued, the Houbara population will vanish in a decade or so,” Khan said.\n\n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/3368/86135872.jpg[/img][/url]', '');

Hats off to Omer & Slayer for the amazing arrangement, everything was just right. Omer played the role of host to perfection, the food was fantastic, coffee and timing even better. The part of the GTG that I enjoyed the most apart from the discussion was the Magrib prayer that we all offered together. \n\nIt was great meeting Skeeter60 and Munir Sahib specially, I would just like to say again that people like these should be treasured and knowledge learned from their immense databases of lifetime experiences. I feel embarrassed when people say I know anything about firearms or shooting in comparison to these gentlemen, the fact is, they are in a league of their own. Another important credit to them is that while a lot of people know about firearms and shooting almost all of them are selfish and not willing to impart any of their knowledge.

But then again I dont own hollands or stuff like that and dont put them away for more than 3 months. (not a collector). So I dont need to pamper them. \n\nOne more thing, once I bought a spray can of Hoppes dry lube. When sprayed, it would leave a slippery white opaque film on the metal which was impenetratable and provided sufficient lubrication so that the weapon could be used just like that. Also it did not attract dirt or moisture. Never found it again though. ANy thoughts on possibly using it for protection purposes?', ''),

If your handgun is not rated for AT LEAST +P you shouldnt use military rounds in 9mm. IN any case these are harder on the springs and slides and decrease the life of the weapon with extensive usage.', ''),

There is a formula relating to the angle of firing line you have to apply when aiming upward or downward. You must have notices that when you shoot at sharp angle  (upward or downward) your projectile always hit below the object you are aiming at. So please google around to get the exact formula for aiming n shooting above or below the horizon. \nBy the way I have a Leopold rage finder that gives the exact distance + angle of sight and the True Ballistic Range which always is less than the exact distance if object is high or low.', ''),

(50844, ' good contribution hasnain !\nThere are so many reasons for rapid reduction of Hubara''s population, however, the hunts conducted by Arab dignitaries is definitely not one of the reasons, rather, they have deployed a strong and large force of hundreds of guards who patrol the designated area 24 hours 365 days and these guards literally shoot the poachers if someone dares. The designated habitat which is 100 sq miles (also covering Cholistan) has been leased to UAE for 100 years so we may rest assured this pretty bird will be preserved by sheikhs for at least 100 years. \nAs regards the bag they take home, most of the people think they do indiscreet hunting but that is totally wrong. They greatly apprise this bird and their bag of 200 birds is reasonably appropriate, whereas, the huge price they pay to the Govt & people of Pakistan, especially, what they have done for the locals is worth this bag. \nMy elder brother was in UAE air force and used to escort one of their seven C130s which they used to bring to Pakistan full of hunting and camping gear ..etc other than four Boing 747s which used to bring their families to Pakistan.\nAfter the hunt, Sheikh Zaid used to send his hunted bustards in beautiful decorated silver plates to various heads of the states (mostly Arabs), royal dignitaries and his family members and with each plate he used to send a royal escort headed by one of his ambassadors or some high ranking official.\nThe reason this bird is so greatly apprised ... it''s considered to be an "aphrodisiac" .. or in simple words for my friends, it''s like our "Salajeet" which enhances man''s sexual potency ...! [b](which is a myth and totally a wrong concept)[/b] so unfortunately, in the Arab world, this bird is more precious than a diamond and eating its meat is considered to be a great honor, obviously, since it is far too rare & expensive to hunt. \nSo after having read this ... I would suggest my friends at PG that they should NOT hunt this endangered specie (or they may get hunted by the Sheikh''s guards.... lol) .. and better do a good "GUZARA"  with "SALAJEET" which is not so expensive and can be found easily all over Pakistan ....lolz\n\nPS : I have photos of various other species of Hubara bustard but I''ll have to find them in my PC and upload them to Photo Bucket before I paste them here.', ''),

And always approach to the field from the opposite direction of wind towards hunting field.\n\nThe smell of diesel will attract to the big trophies of Wild Boars settled in that area. This tip you can practice for any kind of hunting method.\nI am posting this tip only and only for my dear hunters, but its also beneficial for outfitters those who are not having much practice or field knowledge of Jungle lore.\n\nWith best wishes for all Pakguns.com hunters. Soon, I am going to propose a Wild Boar hunt for Pakguns.com members purely according to world class professional hunting of Wild Boars. And members will found its not a luxury as many are thinking.\n\nBecause, HUNTING MASTERS aim is motivation towards well plan and guided hunts, and without fear of heavy budget. For, your knowledge updates. \nAlready, Hog Dear, Blue Buck, Black Buck, Himalayan Ibex, Sind Ibex and Pheasant shoots are legal and affordable just against few thousand rupees fee of government, but in fact outfitters interest is always for foreigners not in the favour of domestics.\n\nIn fact Pakistan is and practically can be big market also for Pakistani hunters, government can collect big amount in the sham of trophy hunting revenue. \nHope that shortly it should be possible, Hunting Masters is working for this projects already.\n\nWith, best wishes.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', ''),

So just keep it this way for a dew days so all members may know what happened. But wen I''ll resume my thread (in near future) with a fresh start i''m sure it will be a better contribution for my friends at PG. \nActually my main collection is composed of over 7000 quality color slides which took me "THIRTY YEARS" to make. Out of these, at least 3000 are non duplicates (I used to throw away ordinary ones) and they are all good enough for sale around the world. But scanning and cleaning small blemishes on them in photo shop takes a long time. Otherwise, I could post photos for next 20 years without repeating a single one ! \nBut some day I''ll try to open my boxes (filled with selica-jel to safe them from moisture) and try to scan as many as I can.\nSome of my slides from 1980s fetched international honors for me. But the problem is on internet it is so damn easy to pirate photos and use them commercially. This piracy was dificult before internet was invented. \nIt''s a pity that most of the European and American agencies who claim to be the leaders of copy rights are actually involved in stealing photos of people from Asia, Africa and other third world countries because they know we cant go to the courts in their countries and claim our rights but they are very careful in pirating photos of their own people because they know they can face the consequences so damn easily when the victim brings them to the court.\nAnyway, I''m so very thankful to all my friends at PG for appreciating my photos and encouraging me to share my experience with them and it was a great opportunity to learn a lot, I mean it, "A LOT" from all of young and power packed boys of PG ... may God bless you all !\nMeanwhile, during this course if I''ve said anything which may have hurt someone''s feelings, (especially, anthrax, omer751, hasnain, denovo, choctalpur .. & others  who disliked my recent comments) .. I feel sorry and urge them to forgive me as I respect them all and their opinions !\nWith my best regards, may I say goodbye to all of you until I return to PG some day in the near future !\nSincerely yours \nKaiser', ''),

It is this behaviour that is part of the cause of the decline of their numbers as they are poached during their migration to be used as training birds for falcons, or for food. \n\n   The houbara bustards are well adapted to arid environments and are able to survive for long periods without food or water. They rarely drink in the wild as they gain most of the liquid they require form the dew on plants as well as from the animals that they eat. They are opportunistic herbivores with prey that includes small mammals, reptiles and snakes as well as invertebrates (locusts, beetles, ants, snails, caterpillars, termites and even scorpions) and plant material such as seeds, shoots, leaves and flowers. \nTheir mottled feathers give them good camouflage and they are secretive and cautious birds. Although they are strong fliers, they prefer to run or to avoid detection by taking cover under a bush or crouching flat on the ground. On the ground they can reach speeds of up to 40 km per hour while in flight they can go 65 km per hour. Once airborne the houbara tries to avoid being caught by a falcon by twisting and turning at great speed and ejecting a sticky jet of foul-smelling green liquid towards the purser.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/aV1KV9M0.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/350/92741283.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/3372/40276527.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nSource:[url]http://houbara.com/english/conservation-programs/[/url]', ''),

So, while not questioning these characteristics of the bustard, I would tend to agree with the members that, if scientifically proven, it may be more of a taboo than a truth.', ''),

(51182, ' Gunfire as far as i understand your question, your preference is a semiauto over an O/U due to recoil factor but as your primery motive of buying a shotgun is Skeet or trap so every body recomends an O/U, you want to know why not a semiauto?\n\nFirst of all i will try to clarefy the recoil part. All sports loads are very light like 1Oz (28 grm) or less upto 7/8 Oz (24 grm) so have a negligible recoil. After some time you will not even feel it. At the same time felt recoil is a relative term if you have a gun that fits you and you have a proper shooting stance along some shooting experience even heavier loads are not a big deal. Semiauots, sometime can''t cycle properly while shooting very light sporting loads, although this is less likely in the present scenario of much better semiautos, but can not overlook completely.\n\nSecondly, maintenance of a semiauto requires too much time as compared to an O/U. In the bigning one dosen''t take this seriously, but, after sometime when one becomes regular in sports and get used to the fascination of firearms, cleaning the gun becomes a burdon. Imagine the two minutes cleaning of an O/U without going through any opening and closing of bolts and screws.\n\nFinally the most important part. Have you seen a guy wearing joggers under the Shalwar Kamiz. We always laugh by looking at such person, sincerely why does we do that? Isn''t that guy wearing comfortable shoos? Why we prefer Shalwar Kamiz for Eid and Jumma Prayer? Why we prefer suits for business meetings and dinners? Basically, we have developed some customes, traditions and fashion. Such is the case with Skeet, Trap and Sporting clays. So, O/U is the gun that is used in Sports shooting, you will identify yourself much closer to the sporting community and the sports while following the tradition.\n\nI am also a great fan of traditional doubles, but i prefer classic music over rock or jazz too. :)', ''),
(51183, ' @ gunfire... i think you should go for a semi auto as it is a multi purpose gun ( i.e for skeet/trap, self defence and hunting ). The only small issue is that a semi auto shotgun can be dangerous at the firing range, specially when in the hands of a person who is new to guns. At the range, one has to open the side by side or over unders after firing. This makes the people around you feel comfortable that ur gun is not loaded. \nThis safety measure cannot be practiced with a semi auto and even a professional can end up in accidental firing.', ''),

It is giving me perfect service. Baikal with wooden stock are a bit on the heavier side in weight. Although it has advantage in terms of relatively less recoil as compared to lighter guns but carrying it all the day in Pothohar broken grounds climbing small hillocks up and down becomes taxing. Similarly Turkish shot guns are also worth their price, however, they do not have much resale value. Coincidently I have a Turkish 12 Gauge O/U with one trigger and five chokes with wooden stock. I have not used it much but its very much OK with me (although I am addicted to my Baikal).\n   Now as far as the used one are concerned it all depends on their condition or how have they been used.

Is there any harm in buying a Sami-Auto for my purpose as everyone is saying I should buy O/U.\nI will highly appreciate all your expert advices...[/quote]\n\ni''m gonna make it quick cause Hassan Jamshad Bhai has pretty much summed up ur options and i doubt it that i can add anything else.\n\nan O/U is the best option u got, recoil is non issue cause target loads do not generate that much recoil and for hunting where only a few shots are involved, one can compromise. similarly on a skeet/trap field where shots fired can go in hundreds, an o/u would last a long time compared to a semi auto. one more thing: cleaning an o/u is alot easier than a semi auto. if u plan to hunt only ocassionally, focusing more on skeet/trap, I can not suggest u any gun other an o/u.\n\ncontinuing Hassan Bhai''s example of joggers, think of ur o/u as a jogging shoes and a skeet field as a jogging track, similarly think of u''r semi auto as formal shoes and a hunting as a business meeting.\n\nwith that in mind, imagine this scenario:\n\nif u plan to jog more and attend less meetings, which type of shoes u would prefer? i''m sure joggers, cause ofcourse u''ll be jogging regularly and u can use the same joggers in a meeting if the need ever arises (i''m assuming that the meeting is a rare event).\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. u''ll find o/u totally dominating the international sport shooting matches. there must be a reason to it, right?', ''),

(51226, ' [quote=Omer571]@Midreestaj: Whats Weaver and whats Isoceles, bro? Plz elaborate[/quote]\n\nIsosceles Stance: \n\n- Stand with legs about shoulder-width apart and the knees slightly bent. Face your target squarely, with feet parallel and pointed at the target.\n- Extend both arms out in front of you and lock the elbows. Cup your gun hand with your other hand. Keep your back straight.\n- Lean your upper body toward your target. Your shoulders are squared to the target, head is leaned down to line up the gunsight to your target.\n\n\nWeaver Stance of Shooting:\n- Body is BLADED to the target (at an angle) unlike Isoscles \n- Your dominant leg(mostly right) is a little backwards, and the less dominant leg stays bit forward\n- Legs a little bent at angles to provide cushioning and stability to the gesture, also legs are your shoulder width apart to provide stability against recoiling weapon, body weight is a little leaned forward\n- You hold the weapon with your dominant hand(mostly right) with a firm grip, usually with a bit straightened arm(with elbow relaxed in weaver stance/ IF elbow locked it comes to modified weaver), and let the weaker hand cup over the finger''s of dominant hand while giving support to the frame of the weapon. Weaker arm is bent and elbow points towards ground\n- while your dominant arm stretches forward, it pushes the gun forward, on the same time, weaker hand pulls it back on the instance of firing.. this gives a hydraulic cushion to your shooting stance and is for better stability under repeated shots.\n\nNOTE: These are the two most favored pistol/revolver shooting stances. \n@Hassan Jamshad :) Sir I dont believe in Modified versions of weaver or Isosceles as proper STANCES! They are well customized according to ones own requirements or group of people''s requirements. \nCurrently many of the competitor shooters are preferring Isosceles, but that doesn''t mean they are not in favor of Weaver. Each one has its own benefits and the one that suits you more, or the one that gives you shooting on the go, better pointability/control/accuracy over repeated shots with yourself moving or still, is the one for you to go with. Try both.', ''),

The shooting was done at the worst possible time of the day, around midday (simmering mirages all the way). Pretty stiff diagonal wind, coming in from 10 o’clock.

I have a tendency of sharing most things with PakGuns members as I feel we are more a family than anything else. \n\nPakGuns expenses were getting a little out of hand, I had been financing it solely for the past 8/9 months but I think around 20 K a month is a strain on anyone''s pocket. Many members have asked me at various different times to start a monthly subscription or a PakGuns account which all members can contribute to but I never felt it appropriate to ask my friends to do that. PakGuns was started as a public service and a [b]free [/b]site for the Gun Enthusiasts of Pakistan and InshAllah it will always remain so. \n\nWe had some good offers from different brands but I felt most were either irrelevant (Cooking Oils, Food related, Marketing companies etc) or small brands which we could not promote with knowing anything about. Zong made us an offer and although it''s was not the most lucrative, the product is relevant to our needs and itself a growing brand like us. I went with them as I think them more capable to understand and accommodate our future needs keeping in mind our rate of growth.\n\nUnder consideration were also Firearms shops and although they were better paying as a whole that would have required us to display many small ad''s which is something I don''t want.  Ad''s have to be as unobtrusive as possible to our PakGuns experience.\n\nI would like to make a special mention for our Marketing Guru, who got us a world of options and did a fantastic job.

(51310, ' [b]Saddled with Insas, Indian Army wants new AK-47s[/b]\n\n[b]The indigenous 5.56x45mm Insas [/b](Indian National Small Arms System) rifle has been the standard assault weapon for the Indian Army since the late 1990s. However, the jawans using it in counter-insurgency operations find it ineffective.\n\n[img]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SqUZAXdPXoI/AAAAAAAACuQ/7BQxTiL3q70/s400/DSC00072.JPG[/img]\n\nAs part of the new Army doctrine, the gun is meant to incapacitate the enemy, rather than kill. Insas has a smaller calibre, which means it has less power. This is because — and it’s the official view — injuring an enemy can lead to enemy soldiers getting engaged in tending the wounded, thus yielding a tactical battlefield advantage.\n\nThe technocrats who interacted with soldiers in the forward areas were told that this theory does not work with terrorists who, apart from attacking in small numbers, are never bothered about evacuating their injured. Hence, the soldiers say, they want to shoot to kill, rather than maim.\n\nThe soldiers also spoke about practical difficulties in using [b]Insas. It’s accurate but not as rugged as the AK-47 [/b]used by terrorists, they say. Also, its sling often snaps while firing, making it fall during manoeuvres. The sling also obstructs the rifle’s sight. But most of all, the size of the sling never took into account the bullet proof jacket worn by jawans. As a result, it falls short and is uncomfortable to hold. This hampers quick reaction. [b]Insas also does not have a rapid fire feature; it shoots only three rounds in a single burst.[/b]\n\n[b]‘‘The barrel overheats with continuous firing. The magazine cracks even on falling, which is common during action. Oil spillage while firing is also major trouble,’’ [/b]said a source quoting soldiers. ‘‘Zeroing (adjusting the sight for aim) has to be done each time the rifle is opened to clean or for any other reason. Lack of proper zeroing hampers the working of night vision device,’’ said the same source.\n\nThe total additional weight — around 40 kg with bulletproof jacket and signalling equipment — that a soldier carries is also a matter of concern, as is the colour of the rifle: they want it in brown which offers better camouflaging. On the positive side, Insas’s transparent magazine helps soldiers keep a count of bullets.\n\nFormer director general of infantry, Lt General Shanker Prasad, said Insas is antiquated and the Infantry needs a modern rifle. The Army has repeatedly asked for new assault weapons, but nothing has moved. It’s learnt that forces are now expecting [b]new indigenously developed AK-47 rifle[/b] said to be an improvement on the original.\n\nsource\nasiandefence', ''),

(51313, ' [b][u]Benchrest[/u][/b]\nThe word benchrest conjures images of rifle target shooters precisely aiming to achieve a bullet hole in the center of the target -- over and over. Take that concept of benchrest shooting and apply it to handguns, and you automatically throw in a few other factors that affect each shot, in ways different than shooting a rifle. Whereas a benchrest rifle shooter supports the gun on a rest and uses elbows, cheek, and shoulder to maintain the rifle position, a handgun shooter has only the rest and grip to support and maintain the gun position. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4716/81553951.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b][u]Modern Isosceles Stance[/u][/b]\n\n\nThis two-handed shooting stance is a natural progression from the bench. The Modern Isosceles Stance begins with foot placement: stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and with the body weight distributed evenly. Do not lock your knees. Straighten your back and roll your hips slightly to flatten out the curve of your lower back. This position varies from its predecessor, the Isosceles, because you tilt your upper body forward slightly. Your head is erect and your arms are fully extended, creating an isosceles triangle. Bring the pistol to eye level. Lean forward slightly and make sure the pistol points naturally to the center of the target.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4248/22985429.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b][u]Weaver Stance[/u][/b]\n\n Named for L.A. county deputy sheriff Jack Weaver who developed the Weaver Stance in the 1950s, the Weaver Stance turns the body in relation to the target and creates a push-pull tension between the shooting and supporting arms and hands. \n\nStand with the shoulder of your strong (gun) hand back in relation to the shoulder of your supporting (weak) hand. Place your strong foot back, too. Hold the gun toward the target and keep your body at a 45-degree angle in relation to the target with your elbows tucked in. Grip the gun and push forward with your strong hand. Bend that elbow slightly. Pull back on the grip with your weak hand and bend that elbow slightly. This type of grip creates a push-pull stress that causes the gun to return downward in recoil after being fired. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/8701/30392345.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b][u]The Modified Weaver Stance[/u][/b]\n A stance developed by world champion shooter Ray Chapman, uses the push-pull of the Weaver with an adjustment to the elbows. Instead of both elbows being flexed, the strong side elbow is straight and locked and the weak elbow is bent slightly and turned toward the ground. The Modified Weaver gets support from not only muscle, but also skeletal support. It is an excellent stance for women.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/9050/69300045.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

AS we all know none of the dealers even give proper invoices mentioning the tax amounts on the sales they make.  What do my friends fell about this issue?\n\n\n\nFBR unearths massive ST evasion by arms, ammunition sector \n[url]http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?id=958725&currPageNo=1&query=&search=&term=&supDate=[/url]\n\nRECORDER REPORT \nISLAMABAD (September 08 2009): The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has unearthed massive evasion of sales tax by the registered manufacturers, importers and dealers of the arms and ammunition during the last two financial years. Sources told Business Recorder on Monday that the arms and ammunition dealers, importers and manufactures had shown low turnover for suppression of sales despite exceptional increase in prices of such commodity.\n\nAt the same time, importers of arms/ammunition have been involved in under-invoicing to evade duties and taxes. Thirty big sales tax registered taxpayers in the category of arms and ammunition had shown poor sales tax collection during 2008-09, which prompted the officials to investigate the whole sector. All units have obtained the National Tax Numbers (NTNs), but are paying meagre amount of sales tax into the national kitty.\n\nAccording to FBR analysis, the tax offices had totally ignored this potential sector for collection of accurate amount of sales tax by checking tax evasion. The data analysis further showed that no dealer, importer or manufacturer of arms/ammunition had claimed sales tax refund.\n\nData showed that 30 leading manufacturers, importers, retailers/dealers of arms/ammunition made net payment of Rs 18.180 million as sales tax during first eleven months of 2008-09. There is a gross difference of Rs 22.751 million in sales tax payment in view of input/output of this sector.\n\nThe tax profiles of sales tax payment by the arms and ammunition sector for the year 2007-08 vis-à-vis 2008-09 was taken for the purpose of comparative analysis. The profile for the aforesaid period reflects that all the registered persons in the arms and ammunition sector are paying negligible amount of sales tax despite the fact that all imports/sales and manufactures have to be fully documented.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the prices of arms and ammunition of various bores have gone very high in the open market whereas the annual sales of the arms and ammunition sector portray a dismal picture of the annual turnover which apparently seems to have been suppressed.\n\nIt is interesting to mention that the values of these items at the time of import are being grossly under-invoiced which need to be investigated and compared vis-a-vis the values of arms and ammunition supplied locally. The collection from this source/sector appears to have been ignored all along by the concerned RTOs/ LTUs. Therefore, to tap the potential revenue from this source there is a need to initiate an in-depth investigative audit by the LTUs and RTOs.\n\nThe investigative report would help in plugging the leakage of revenue in this sector. FBR data showed that a registered unit of Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU), Islamabad had shown gross difference of Rs 16.968 million in sales tax payment in view of input/output analysis during first 11 months of 2008-09. The unit had made net payment of Rs 6.230 million during this period.\n\nSimilar trend in sales tax collection has been observed in cases of registered units at Regional Tax Office (RTO), Peshawar. A registered manufacturer within the jurisdiction of RTO, Karachi has made net payment of Rs 1.501 million during this period. A registered manufacturer within the jurisdiction of RTO, Faisalabad made net payment of Rs 1.114 million.\n\nOther units relating to the arms and ammunition within the jurisdiction of RTO Peshawar has shown downward trend in sales tax payment during this period. For example, a manufacturer within the RTO Peshawar has paid Rs 1.928 million as net sales tax.\n\nSome importers of arms and ammunition within the jurisdiction of RTO, Karachi and Lahore had made sales tax payment of Rs 0.002 million each. An importer and arms dealer of this item within the jurisdiction of RTO, Sialkot has made net sales tax payment of Rs 0.012 million during this period. Another importer of RTO Karachi has made the same payment of Rs 0.012 million.\n\nThe same kind of sales tax payment trend has been observed by the arms manufacturers falling within the jurisdiction of RTO, Rawalpindi. For example, two manufacturers of RTO Rawalpindi paid Rs 0.87 million and Rs 0.105 million as net sales tax. A retailer registered with the RTO Karachi has paid Rs 0.155 million as sales tax during first 11 months of 2008-09.', ''),

(51444, ' Gentlemen, \n\nThere is no aphrodisiac quality in houbara. The only reason why the Arabs hunt it, is because they have the time and the money to do it. The thrill in houbara hunting is in the chase. Nothing as exhilirating as watching a falcon trained by yourself, match the bustard turn for turn, wingbeat for wingbeat. Although the houbara looks slow, it is not. It  can out fly a falcon in a head wind,  deliver some real nasty crap on it''s face in mid air and also give it a good beating in a ground battle. \n\nUnfortunately, the houbara is under persecution everywhere. It''s breeding grounds in Central Asia have been ploughed up for cotton farming. It''s ruthlessly chased in its wintering grounds. In Pakistan, it is either hunted by the Arabs or it is trapped by the people working for them and then smuggled abroad to the Gulf States. The remaining houbara are shot, out of spite, Pakistani hunters.\n\nThe biggest culprit behind the decline of the houbara in Pakistan is the government itself.  It prohibits Pakistanis from hunting but invites Arabs to do to the same. This is is apartheid, and a travesty of the law. Pakistanis have the first right to natural resources of this country. The argument put forward by some people that the Arabs pay billions to the government, is akin to the argument put forward by landlords in rape cases, where they claim they can sleep with any of their bonded labourers wives, sisters or daughters, as the menfolk of these women owe them money. \n\nPakistan is for Pakistanis.', ''),

In other words should group five shots  within  one inch at 100 yds  and 3ins at 300 yds repeatedly.\nThis is only possible with proper ammunition and proper tune-ing of the rifle, use of proper scope mounts and a proper scope.\nShooting beyond this range accurately and consistently will require a lot of work on the rifle and a lot of time under the sun.\nWe could some time have a friendly match on the ranges with .22 rifles to begin with at 50m or 100m.\nThe Rifle I used is a Mauser SR 86  (Sniper Rifle) with a Swarowski sniper scope. The snipers under training are from the Army and it always warms my heart and makes me feel younger when I am with soldiers.

Cut four two-inch diameter wooden poles six to four feet long; sharpen one end to fix in the ground.\n2.	Purchase common chicken wire net and cut two pieces.\n3.	Staple each piece to two poles, one pole on each end of the chicken wire net.\n4.	Wave brush, weeds and camo cloth into the wire.\n5.	Roll up each section for easy transport.\nWhen you get to your hunting ground spot, push the poles into the ground forming a shape similar to a football. Then take brush limbs, etc….and make a little cover for the top.\nThis blind can be an easily place and move as frequently as needed. \nThis blind costs very little, it will provide excellent camouflage. \n\nBest wishes for current hunting season.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', ''),

(51581, ' respect to all the opinions from different members .. Just my thoughts on this please…but to be kept in mind is the Self Defense shooting. No range stuff here.\n\nWeaver differs from Isosceles by the method of hold of the weapon basically.\n\nWeaver includes ‘push and pull’ technique using both arms on the weapon, while Isosceles involves constant alignment (balanced) and straightening out of both arms.\n\nWeaver: your arms cushion the recoiling energy from the weapon\nIsosceles: your arms being relatively rigid transfer recoil to body.\n\nWeaver stance is great for holding the gun in controlled environment. Only the correct amount of tension applied to both arms, tends to absorb recoil efficiently. Otherwise it can imbalance you between shot to shot. If you are in a real life situation, who knows how’s it going to be like? It’s hard for you to maintain that super correct and refined posture every time, varying shot to shot. Either the push and pull thingy goes SUPER RELAXED or OVERDONE leading to, not up to the mark shot placement.  \n\nIsosceles on the other hand is natural body position. Arms are both triangled to the shoulders. Weapon’s recoiling force moves right through middle of your body every time and is being absorbed by both arms equally. Arms are held as high as shoulders most of the time and its again naturally done posture.\n\nAbrupt un-holstering of the weapon and fired shots on target/s **clearly an SD situation**, in here we see Isosceles as a leader in the stances. You can’t be faster and more accurate on targets than Isosceles. \n\nSame quick shots on delivered to different targets, using Weaver stance with accuracy and speed requires ACCURATE tension build up in your Push (strong arm) and Pull (weak arm) strategy.\n\nI am convinced that, Isosceles allows shooter to concentrate on shooting without worrying about maintaining active tension in the stance. Both halves of the body are doing the same thing and the resulting symmetry is easier to resume, especially under stress.\n\nIt is very much believed that, Weaver gives you superior control over ‘shooting on the go’. Being said that, I would say Isosceles also gives you the best pivoting effect. You can move to left or to right in a flick, as compared to Weaver. \n\nAnd don’t forget not to carry out a stance unless you are about to shoot. Very simple logic behind this. Ofcourse one should not run to take cover or strafe while maintaining a proper stance. No body does that. But when you are about to shoot, resuming an Isosceles stance is quicker, and yet naturally build up, provoking more efficient shooting over all.\n\nIsosceles also tends to be the favorite amongst SD shooters and experts who manage to deliver surgical shots within least time. So to get the maximum out of something concept, I’ll advocate Isosceles. Weaver does cover all aspects well enough though.\n\nSo which ever you like, do practice it because without practice it is just crap that will slow down your response in the RED times… :)', ''),

(51583, ' I was reading about the classic English shotguns and came across this information. I thought this could be very interesting for our shotgun enthusiasts. This article is taken from [b]Sporting Shooter[/b] by Diggory Hadoke:\n\n                                                                    [b]Classic Guns[/b]\n                                                                     \n                                                                   Holland & Holland\n\nAfter WW1, Holland & Holland sold guns bought from Webley & Scott as ''H&H Shot and Regulated''. They were taken to the H&H shooting grounds and were there shot and regulated before being sold with the seal of approval of Holland''s. The guns were of plain finish and medium quality. The actions are engraved ‘H&H''. The top rib is engraved ‘Shot and Regulated by Holland & Holland''.\n\n \n\nIn the 1950s Holland & Holland sold a boxlock called the ‘Northwood'' (after their shooting ground). It was made in Birmingham by the firms of S. Wright & Son and A Brown & Son on a Webley 700 action. Holland & Holland claimed that the guns were finished in the London factory and shot and regulated at the Badminton Shooting Ground but they acknowledged the origins of the gun in their advertising: ‘This new model is not manufactured entirely at our gun works in London but the final finishing is carried out there...'' \n\n \n\nThe Northwood model was available as a game gun, or as a wildfowl and pigeon gun. It has a colour-hardened action with border engraving and a mildly ‘fancy back''. Wood tends to be straight grained and relatively plain. Bore sizes available for the Northwood were 12, 16, 20 and 28. The Northwood was available until the mid-1980s.\n\n \n\nThe standard specifications indicated a 12-bore with 2 ½" chambers and English steel barrels of any length chosen by the customer. Weight for a game gun was typically 6lb 8oz. The wildfowling version could be had with 2 ¾" chambers weighing 7lb 6oz or with 3" chambers weighing 7lb 12oz. \n\n \n\nSmall bore 2 ½" chambered ‘Northwood'' models were available: A 16-bore game gun weighed 6lb, a 20-bore 5lb 9oz and a 28-bore was 5lb. The pigeon gun had 2 ¾" chambers, whether in 12-bore, 16-bore or 20-bore and these guns were correspondingly heavier, typically 3-4 oz more then equivalent game guns.\n\n \n\nIn 1985 Holland & Holland purchased W&C Scott, who had a long history of making guns for Holland''s. With the purchase came the plan to build a new ‘London boxlock'', starting off in Birmingham in the old Scott factory in Witton and being stocked, engraved and finished in Holland & Holland''s Harrow Road factory. It was sold as the ''Cavalier''.\n\n \n\nProduction of this new model leaned heavily on the CNC machinery acquired with the Scott purchase (production machinery was moved to London in 1989). The basic design stemmed from the Webley 700 but was carefully re-worked with a ''Royal'' type hinge pin and best quality barrels. The ‘Cavalier'' in basic and ‘de-luxe'' forms and was in production from 1986 until the mid 1990s, numbering around 200 guns in total, both in 12-bore and 20-bore. Apparently one 28-bore was built on a 20-bore action. The old Webley 700 was a robust and decent handling gun. It may have head a weakness in the rather slender hook, which is prone to loosening up after afew years use. The retaining pins in the sides of the action, which hold the cocking levers also strip their very fine threads, which is annoying.\n\nHolland and Holland added a removable hinge pin to the design, which may have been a technical improvement. However, thet also dispensed with the hand pin, which was not. I had a pair of Cavaliers in for re-stocking in 2008. The wrist of one had cracked. In order to stop the problem recurring, we had to re-design the whole section, adding a hand-pin to prevent excessive flexing and movement from breaking the new stocks. The quality of the two guns is disappointing: the gold -inlaid ''Holland & Holland'' name on each action does not even match in size.', ''),

There are no computers involved that work is done earlier by ballisticians.\nI am aware that in the Civil sector there are no ranges longer than 50m excep private arrangements and no long range matches.\nThe Army of course is busy training round the clock and being an infantry man this was my bread and butter and one of my specialisations.\nThe ranges are calculated by Laser Range Finders and the range is then applied to the sniper scope elevation dial, the  judgment of wind is a very vast subject and you will have to spend a lot of time on the ranges and shoot to see what does the wind do to the bullet\nWind tables are available for each caliber/MV and BC and these can be applied. Wind speed gauges are available which are as big as a cigarette  lighter   and tell you the wind speed.\nThe problem is you need a hell of a lot of experience to read wind. The speed varies at the firing point and again at the target end and in between.\nExperienced LR shooters know a simple rule of thumb.\nLight wind (speed about 12 Km/hr) RxR x 1/2   here R is range in hundreds of yards\nMedium wind (speed about 20 km/hr) RxR  example 400 (4x4) 16 inches deflection\nStrong Wind   (speed about 35 Km/hr)  RxRx 2 \nNow judging wind speed and direction and angel are the crux of the problem. In case of Diagonal wind you again halve the correction for wind.\nOne way old hunters and snipers use to read wind direction is to put your little finger in your mouth wetting it and then raise your hand and you will know the exact direction of wind.\nActually nothing can replace practical experience. Sniper training is not allowed for our dear civilian brothers it is strictly only for the Army and Navy. \nI have only given you the information which is otherwise available on the net, and some of our experienced hunters are already masters of the art and craft. \nMy sincere appologies to those friends who are masters at this game this information is for our younger brothers keen to learn', ''),

This is an old story. \n\n2- All High end Purdey, Boss and Holland and Holland(currently these manufecturers make only High end guns) guns are made with hand by the top craftsmen, absolutely no use of machines.\n\n3-This article is strictly about the boxlock guns those were sold under the names of NORTHWOOD and CAVALIER. First model was made in Birmingham from W&C Scot facilites and was sold under the umbrella of Holland & Holland. The other was made on the machines acquired through the purchase of W&C Scot in early eighties. Only these guns were made on CNC machines. Neither these guns were premium nor company claimed anything fancy about them. \n\nNow 12Gauge sir i can''t comment on your choice of Baikal but one thing is for sure whenever i am going to buy a new shotgun it will be a Baikal, and this is going to happen very soon.

The committee is headed by Abdul Qadir Patel of the PPP. \n\nAccording to a report, the prime minister largely focussed on a future mechanism which the interior ministry should adopt to curb illegal issuance of arms licences. \n\nSince the government came to power, the interior ministry has issued 28,527 such licences between March 28, 2008 and June 26, 2009, including 6,000 licences which were approved by the State Minister for Interior Tasneem Qureshi over a two-month (May-June) period this year. \n\nIt was learnt that instead of conducting an independent inquiry, the committee relied on information provided by the Federal Investigation Agency. \n\nThe committee asked names of 150 people who were issued arms licences without lawmakers’ recommendations. \n\nThe committee also sought justification for awarding contract of smart card to Mr Shahzad, a private vendor, which showed the committee had taken no special initiative to unearth real players behind the scam. \n\nThe FIA’s initial inquiry had found that three section officers of the ministry were involved in the scam.', ''),

I test fired a family member''s when I was around 10 and still remember thinking "I want that".  [url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/templates/images/smiley/agreement/6.gif[/img][/url]\n\nI had been looking for one for a couple of years but it is next to impossible to find a new one or in like new condition. Colt stopped producing them more than a decade ago.  Finally I was lucky enough to come across one and made sure I got it. \n\nIt is in *Mint* condition, in stainless steel finish with a 4 inch barrel. (I would not have bought anything above 4''). The revolver itself it simply amazing, a treat to fire. The action is very smooth, the trigger crisp, sights excellent, accuracy excellent and the recoil is very manageable due to the slightly heavy weight. The grips are rubber, Houge like making it comfortable to hold and fire. \n\nThe revolver fires both .357 magnums and .38 specials. Here are some pictures. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/KingCobra1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/KingCobra2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/KingCobra3.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/KingCobra4.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/KingCobra5.jpg[/img]\n\nIn the picture above are four different kinds of .357 ammo.

I thought why not to ask you a little bit details on the components involved in distant shooting so that we generally could have a better insight instead.\n\nThat is not good, as of course it’s military who will eventually do all kinds of shootings... Its about civilians how much they.. get a chance to shoot. \nAmericans are having all kinds of fun... They are even allowed to keep .50BMG bolt-action rifles for past 1000 yard shootings in most of their states. They have clubs, federations, academies and Ex-Army or L.E retired Instructors to soup up their skills.. \n\nWe are lacking in opportunity, that is, for as handful of people as us. But the good news is awareness is spreading gradually and may be it has grown faster after world''s current state of affairs and position of Pakland in it. Guns as sports is a hell of a fun job to do and mostly all young lads, if given a chance will show interest in it naturally. \nWe need opportunity and allowance on cultural and administrative levels.

We must not forget following:\n\n1- All big names Purdey, Boss and Holland & Holland got some of their guns made from Birmingham when they couldn''t match the ever increasing demand of these finest guns. This is an old story. \n\n2- All High end Purdey, Boss and Holland and Holland(currently these manufecturers make only High end guns) guns are made with hand by the top craftsmen, absolutely no use of machines.\n\n3-This article is strictly about the boxlock guns those were sold under the names of NORTHWOOD and CAVALIER. First model was made in Birmingham from W&C Scot facilites and was sold under the umbrella of Holland & Holland. The other was made on the machines acquired through the purchase of W&C Scot in early eighties. Only these guns were made on CNC machines. Neither these guns were premium nor company claimed anything fancy about them. \n\nNow 12Gauge sir i can''t comment on your choice of Baikal but one thing is for sure whenever i am going to buy a new shotgun it will be a Baikal, and this is going to happen very soon.

In Pakistan mostly available are 3inch chamber lengths and its absolutely useless to buy a 3.5inch shotgun as 1. cartridges are not available and 2. 3.5 inch semi autos are not that reliable with lighter loads.\n\nhope it helps.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Time and oft I have seen houbaras kick and wing whip the crap out of many a mediocre falcon. \n\nThe most unique weapon in the houbara''s arsenal is the slimy, glue intestinal mucus squirts at any winged predator in flight, leaving the adversary literally shit faced. This foul smelling not only temporarily blinds the pursuer, but also sticks to its feather like glue, rendering it flightless. Quite often, falcons and hawks that have been at the receiving end of this treatment refuse to fly houbara ever again.', ''),

(52045, ' That was the frequent problem of gas operated pistols. The cylinder would need to be changed every 50 shots. Some cylinders were refillable but the commonly availble ones were disposable. \n\nSome people also use the soda gas pressure can to refil their cylinders, that gets you about 20 shots. \n\nAnother problem with gas cylinders is that the pressure acts funny depending on temperature.

(52047, ' A rifle needs to be accurised before expecting  it to perform well ie put 5 shots regularly in 1.5 inches or lesser at 100 yds.\nMost quality rifles will do it but would still be prone to shifting zeroe with the change in weather.\nFollowing work has to be done.\n\nFREE  FLOATING the BARREL\nEnsure the barrel ; from 1 to 2inches ahead of where the receiver ends, does not touch the stock. You are able to slide a paper under the barrel between the stock  just short of the receiver. This can be done by a gun smith who can deepen and slightly widen the barrel channel of the stock.\n\nGlass Bedding the Action.\n\nThe action should be bedded in steel epoxy. The method of glass bedding is given with complete instructions and pictures on the net so please follow those instructions.\nThis will ensure your rifle will not change zero what ever weather changes occur. The stock wood shrinks and expands with changes in humidity and temperature exerting pressure on the action and the barrel, thus shifting zeroe.\n\nThe trigger should have a crisp let off at about three pounds ( less than that will lead to accidental discharges and poor trigger control in hunting)\n\nMuzzle Crowning\nThe muzzle should be crowned to 11 degrees as we mostly use boat tailed bullets and the rifles come with a 45 degree crown. The 11 degree suits th BT bullets.\n \nOnce these things are done your rifle will be ready to shoot accurately without shifting zeroe what ever the weather conditions.', ''),

It is ruined by two things if improperly done. CHORD WEAR and ROD WEAR.\nNever pull, a pull through from the Muzzle, always insert from the muzzle and pull from the breach/chamber side\n\nAlways remove the bolt and insert the rod from the chamber side. If you do reverse of this you can destroy the accuracy potential of a rifle in few careless cleanings. The chord and rod both cause wear on a particular place allowing gas to escape pushing the base  of the bullet and causing further erosion of the muzzle . When a hard surface is rubbed on a soft surface it is the hard surface which gets eroded if there are unburnt powder particles which are abrasive.  Look at sand paper it wears out steel when rubbed against it as abrasive material sticks to soft material.\n\nPolygonal Rifling\n\nThe first ever rifling was polygonal. The German H&K uses it for rifles so does Glock. For Sniper Rifles this is not the preferred type of rifling as though it helps in getting higher velocities from pistol and rifle barrels it causes more mutilation of the bullet surface and is not good for extreme accuracy. The H&K PSG1 uses it but it is not as accurate at longer ranges as other modern comparable rifles.\nI hope I did justice to your question. Regards', ''),

(52111, ' I think at the distances like 2m upto 5m when the urgency of shooting will fall at once neither Weaver nor Isoceles will be of much use. IMHO, point shooting will be the much useful shooting in this case. In point shooting gun is not aimed at the target but is just pointed at the target. Shooter just rely on his/her instincts to point the gun at the target, keeping his eyes focused at the target strictly no attempt to bring the gun upto the sight plane. In close quarters this is almost impossible to miss a human sized target by even a novice leave aside a properly trained point shooter.

Also the scope is not replaceable easily you have to stick with the same contraption.

The main advantage is that the claw extractor will never slip over the rim of the cartridge. It happens when there is dirt in the chamber, the round is over pressure or the chamber or the cartridge case have a defect being out of round, all these things happen in real life,if the fired case  does not extract and eject  you have the mother of all double feeds. When an angry buffaloe is looking at you as if you owe him money and charging at you the Murphies laws take over.\nIf any thing can go wrong; it will. At a time it hurts most.\n\nBrother you do not want Mr. Murphy''s Law to hold true when confronted with a buffaloe, an elephant, a lion, a Rhino or leopard. May be most of these will change their minds but never a Buffaloe .\nThe controlled feed is also extremely reliable at extraction and ejection.

(52231, ' Dear All, \n\nThanks for your kind interest. In routine, we send our packages to just one outfitter or a group leader (foreign or Pakistani) for any hunting, trekking or climbing expedition/safari and negotiate all aspects of the trip with one person (middle man) and that agency/person corresponds with all other group members/clients and forwards us the bookings with payments when everything is finalized, meanwhile, all inquiries from our clients/group members are sent to the agency/leader who gets answers from us and forwards them to the concerned members accordingly. This is how we work in routine. \n\nHowever, since this is the first time I''m dealing with a community like PG and posting my packages on a forum I''m a little concerned about any unforeseen complications and may cause any problems at either end. So I''ll make the final  decision after consulting my partners.\n\nAs regards my prices, you may rest assured I''ll not be quoting our standard packages to pak gunners because they are quite expensive, rather, I''ve worked out subsidized prices based on almost breakeven or negligible profits and if I ever make any profit at all at the end of the safari I''ll donate some of it to Pak Guns for promotion of it''s great job it''s doing to educate the youth of Pakistan to understand and adopt the peaceful and responsible gun culture and in this regard I would also like to put in my small fiscal contribution in addition to my support of words.\n\nMy other deep concern is  about the safety of our group members and the people who live in & around the wild boar habitats ... ! Please note, this won''t be a picnic party, rather, a serious hunt done with "REAL GUNS" and God Forbid any mishandling or breach of discipline may cause fatal mishaps whose ultimate responsibility will fall on the outfitter so we must meet, discuss, decide and then draw a firm code of conduct and strict rules to prevent any unforeseen mishaps or accidents.\n\nIt may not be out of place to mention here that since trophy hunting involves a single hunter & he has to shoot just one big game in remote (uninhabited areas) the hunt is literally risk free but since the wild boars are usually shot near inhabited areas and there are many gunners in a group and any careless move, miscommunication or lack of coordination may cause serious accidents, we''ll  have to impose strict code of conduct, discipline and precautions to prevent any accidents.\n\nI hope my comment won''t be reckoned rude when I say that since our esteemed PG members are composed of all age groups (young & mature) and many of us are new hunters with little gun experience, I''ll be most reluctant to take new comers or inexperienced gunners on this trip to prevent any mishaps. \nIn this regard, I would request for the help of our expert and senior PG members to first draw a selection and safety criteria and then proceed to select the qualified gunners who want to go on such safaris. \n\nI know this will be a sensitive and cumbersome job but once we have done it, this will become a standard policy (like as asset) of PG for any such activity in future and all members will enjoy such hunts without fear of causing accidents. \nI hope my esteemed member will understand my concerns over the safety issue ... because it means saving lives so we should take it seriously !\n\nWith my best regards, I''ll revert after I finish my aitekaaf.\n\nUntil ... Eid Mubarik to All of you ! \nCaution : Don''t Get Sick By Overeating on Eid !!! \n\nSincerely\nKaiser', ''),

The poor man passed away a few years back. May God rest his soul in peace.[/quote]\n\nTurumti, u are absolutely right i found the curlews in the field and there were around 12 or 13 in a bunch so we got 7 out of them and exactly my shikari also told me the same thing that it comes after the rain in the inland looking for some food in the fields .\nhave u ever tried its meat? If yes  than how does it taste?\nregards imu10[/quote]\n\nYes I have eaten curlew. Cooked properly, it is quite delicious, but if it not cooked well it will taste like badly cooked duck.  Curlew that have been feeding in the fields for about  a week or so, taste a lot better than curlews shot from the seaside. Their flesh smells less fishy. \n\nIf your cook can do a good job of duck and sandgoruse, Im sure he can do well with curlew too.

There is nothing more annoying when we focus more on subtle detais while completely overlooking the objective acheivement. Hence in other than sports shooting the objective is threat elimination. If one can do that without immitating Mr Weaver or forming an isoceles with shoulders and arms, it is perfectly fine. :)\n\nSir, when it comes to the knowledge of more stable and comfortable body positions that are being practiced by top sports and LE (Law enforcement) shooters there is nothing wrong in discussing in detail. A new shooter can practice these stances and can adopt something that is closest to one''s natural comfortable position. Wish one''s natural stance does not differ too much from the proven best, if it does, even then there is no harm in adopting one''s own until and unless it is effective.

If one can do that without immitating Mr Weaver or forming an isoceles with shoulders and arms, it is perfectly fine. :)[/quote]\n\nPractical shooting and its effectiveness...Sir i''ll again ponder on making a gunfight oriented mindset.. and work on cuttin edge tits and bits to gain a command on it. I''ll say, what you are doing, you must know what it is.. and hence you should train yourself with the best ideas.. \n\nIn marshal arts, if you fight in a haywire style, you usually end up in broken limbs and teeth... why? because you acting out off the course, that gives often chances to the other contestant to kick you hard wherever you present yourself wrongly...\n\nI agree when you said... "A new shooter can practice these stances and can adopt something that is closest to one''s natural comfortable position. Wish one''s natural stance does not differ too much from the proven best"... very well said, it is actually the esence of knowing the proper stances.. \n\nbut i dont agree with you when you said.. "There is completely no need to learn the history of these stances or the names for good shooting"..

You must know what you are doing... move per move and step by step, so that you can contemplate it and well traverse your knowledge to your allies..\n\nWhatever the crazy styles... cannot be effective... neither can you proove it effective if only and only you yourself can shoot good with that style. :)', ''),

Kindly give your opinion about other Spanish shotguns other than AYA aswell.\nbest regards.[/quote]\n\nStill waiting for some informative knowledgeable feedback about Spanish DBBL shotguns, and their current market prices. etc', ''),

(52540, ' Continuing the discussion...\n\n*************** CLOSE RANGE SHOOTING ENCOUNTERS ******************\n\nWe have discussed some ''NOT VERY CLOSE RANGE'' shooting stances:\n- Weaver & Isosceles (please refer to older posts in this thread for details regarding these)\n- We figured "Point Shooting" as the best natural response to close quarter encounters AND bad lighting conditions – Too dim light OR Darkness…\n\n***Now some issues about close range? Like 2-5 meters?***\n- You don’t have time to make a proper gesture with Arms, Torso and legs...\n- Don’t have time to align pistol sights or to make a Flash Sight picture...\n- Don’t have enough space to carry out these moves...\n- You are clearing a building/house type of scenario…\n\nI came across a new stance suitable for above conditions:\n(BUT DON’T TRY THIS AT HOME)  :lol:\n\n~~~ C.A.R  -  Center Axis Relock ~~~\n- Invented by Paul Castle of SabreTactical Security Systems.\n- Invented for close quarter encounters and low light conditions.\n- Better recoil absorption mechanism.\n- Natural instinctive stance as per natural stress response in humans.\n- Tends to provide you a better position to retain your weapon.\n- The need for speed.\n- Optimum use of cover.\n\nNOTE: The development of CAR was based on the requirements of close-range combat with a handgun. But it can be usefully deployed on long guns as well.\n\n* CAR shooting system works in harmony with the body when under stress and is particularly reliable in close quarter situations. The system was developed to improve marksmanship by focusing on natural visual focal points and gross motor movements. The stability of the shooter is improved by creating a lower center of gravity and a secure base.\n\n*Please Watch Paul Castle demonstrating CAR with Pistols, SMG and a Pump-action Shotgun:\n[url]http://www.sabretactical.com/CAR/car.html[/url]\n\nThe Center Axis Relock Method of Gunfighting utilizes two main positions or stances as bases for action...\n \nThe High Position: \nThe first position is called the High position. It is used for working within confined spaces, from cover, and while moving. \nIt is a very strong and flexible base for using both short and long weapons such as a handgun, shotgun, sub-machine gun, and other weapons. \nIn the High position, the operator is in a semi-bladed stance, with the weapon held or cradled next to the chest. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/2049/27643616.jpg[/img][/url]  \n- The position is achieved by blading towards the threat while also drawing and bringing the gun up to the chest. When the gun is drawn, it should be directed to the threat for firing if needed. Also, as the gun is being brought up, the other hand should be moving to grasp and support it. \n- This base position reduces the Operator''s silhouette, employs a balanced and stable, yet flexible body stance, and works in harmony with gross muscle movements, gross motor skills, and our natural reactions to extreme stress, one of which, is to bring the arms and hands back to the body, not away from it. \n- The stance with elbows extended, makes up a natural cradle from which the gun can be fired with both hands or with just the gun hand. \nIts framework sets up a circle of control and defense that makes it very difficult for an Aggressor to grab or take possession of the Operators handgun\n- The circle of control and defense is maintained by rotating towards a threat. In a contact situation, strikes with the elbows and the gun can be made, or the gun can be fired.\n- The stability and ease of movement gained by using a bladed stance, along with keeping the gun at the operator''s natural focal point, allows for fast acquisition of multiple targets. \nAlso, the weak hand is up and ready for use in opening doors, clearing the way, and other tasks. \n- The thumbs can be placed anywhere, as long as their placement does not interfere with the workings of the gun. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/8508/52890087.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThe Extended Position: \n-The second CAR position is called the extended position. It is used for entry, combat, and assault. It also can be used effectively when seated inside a vehicle. \n- The Extended position or stance, allows for high levels of accuracy, as well as very rapid shooting while moving. \n- The gun is held naturally and close to the Operators true focus point (normal reading distance). \n- That is an enhancement over stances that employ full arm extension, as doing that takes the sights out of the Operator''s natural focus point. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6439/34262385.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(52561, ' [quote=ay_be_why]the stock barrel is i think a bit short for hunting. 12Gauge had a shooter with a made-to-order longer barrel so maybe he had a go at hunting/target shooting with it...\n\n@12Gauge, sir there''s a channel "survivalistboards.com" on youtube. that guy, while describing and comparing the 590 and a remington shotgun, said that the 590 can be used for close range hunting, like deer hunting at around 30-40 yds (IF i remember correctly) but not suitable for "shooting birds out of the sky". you mentioned earlier that shooter is a clone of the 590. so can it be used for a  little bit of hunting as that guy said?[/quote]\n\nbro, kindly allow me to break down ur question and answer them point wise.\n\n1. yes, I had a longer barrel specially made for me with modified choke on request. this type of choke though may not be efficient in skeet and some hunting scenarios but i''m sorta very comfortable with modified for almost anything (from skeet, trap to wildbore hunting). infact there is no better choke for "do it all" type of shotgun barrel than a modified choke.\n\n2. shorter barrels usually are full choked by the manufacturer (DSA only). this is done to get a decent pattern out of an otherwise very ultra shot range weapon. plus mostly people in Pakistan use their typical barrel length DSA for hunting as well therefore manufacturer saw it fit to full-choke their barrels. otherwise the international trend is cylinder choked barrels for all HD guns.\n\n3. with shorter barrels, the pattern opens up too quickly therefore at longer ranges the pattern is too open/wide. this reason makes shorter barrels short range firearms. for short range, a shorter barrel is absolutely fine. infact i''ve been doing skeet with shorter barrel as well and there were only a few spots on the field where I thought of having a longer barrel.\n\n4. i''ve sucessfully hunted rabbits and doves with 21inch DSA Shooter. however I prefer the 28inch barrel as its patterns superb and gives u a longer sighting plane for longer shots. infact a friend of mine even shot a high flying pigeon as a bet with DSA outfitted with 28inch barrel. (I absolutely suck at skeet by the way).\n\n5. yes that guy in the video did say that, but if u look closely, he is comparing a longer barrel shotgun with an HD barrel (21inches or less) shotgun. remmy is with long barrel and ofcourse its a fine hunting barrel length, whereas mossy590 is with HD barrel. same case with short barrel DSA. u can hunt with it at close range but cannot take long range shots due to the reasons i''ve mentioned above.\n\nhope it helps.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I guess making barrels with multiple chokes puts the price of their shotgun at par with cheap turkish imports thats why they are not interested in it. plus their product sells just as fine with fixed chokes.

(52672, ' Welcome to the Forum, sir.\n\nThe "laser glider you mention" is actually called a rail, upon which a light or a laser may be mounted.\n\nThere can be two plausible explanations for the difference between the two aforementioned models. One, that Taurus makes the 92/99 in both rail- and rail-less configurations. Two, the rail-less version was the older version and the one with the rail is now the one being manufactured. From pictures in older gun magazines from the 1990s, I am certain that the older model 92/99s [b]did not[/b] have a rail. In either case, it seems pretty clear that you have the rail-less version.\n\nAbout fitting a laser without a rail: I''m not sure if that''s feasible or even possible. Mountable laser modules are out of the question, due to absence of the rails. There might be one other way, a couple of times, I''ve seen a laser module mounted onto the front part of the trigger-guard, however I feel that that particular option is not very stable.\n\nHope that satisfies your query.', ''),

(52702, ' @Omer571\n\nthe videos that u''ve mentioned here shows a guy breaking multiple hand thrown targets. u sound pretty impressed by the vidoes.\n\nlemme break it down for ya:\n\n1. low recoil: almost any gas operated shotgun will have low recoil. thats it, discussing it further is nothing more than running around in circles. Dont gimme me recoil reducing pads and stock mounted recoil (murcury/spring) reducers crap. cause thats nothing more than a marketing gimmick and i''m not interested in perceived recoil either.\n\n2. reliability: bro, if u judge the measure of a shotgun by drowning it in water for 30 hours (from the video u''ve posted) durability, then u''ve got alot to learn. thats not durability, thats just being a show-off, any dime-a-dozen type shotgun can do this. I had a 10K pak made semi auto shotgun (by Majeed sons, Peshawar) and I can say "been there done that".\n\n3. Durability: bro, again, i''m having difficulty choosing the right words. but durability isnt something that can be expressed by shooting 10 clay targets. durability is measured/calculated after firing thousands and thousand of rounds. u have to cross the line of FATIGUE FAILURE before u can tell where it is. in other words you''ll have to go beyond the breaking point to know the true potential of a shotgun.\n\n4. hand thrown clay targets: the videos that u''ve posted mainly show a guy breaking hand thrown clay targets. excluding the talent/skill of the operator, this is not a test of reliablity, this is not a test of low recoil, this is basically a test of cycling speed and feed reliability of the shotgun. any working gun can demonstrate feed reliability as long as it is a working semi auto, however cycling speed is a totally different matter altogether.\n\nso allow me ask that question again: do u want a gun just because it cycles fast?\n\nRegards.', ''),

Capture a Picture with your digital camera of the soil pattern/landscape/bushes pattern at high resolution.\n2.	Draw a canvas at Adobe Photoshop for the size of 4x10 feet.(divide it into pixels or in inches if you required), with minimum 300.dpi resolution.\n3.	 Drag your already captured digital picture at this canvas.\n4.	Save it as PSD File on CD/USB.\n5.	Visit to your nearest Pena Flex  printer, and ask for  the 4x10  feet print size. (Price should be from 20 to 35 rupees per square foot) REMEMBER : ask for 600.dpi print output.\n6.	Take 4-sticks of half inch diameter PVC pipe, each with length of 5’-6’’.(You can also use wooden sticks) NOTE: PVC pipes only can be use for soft ground like sand beds. \n7.	Draw a 4-line at equal distance to make sleeves for the pipes. \n8.	Keep each stick at drawn line & cut a piece of  Pena Flex for the same length.\n9.	Past a Pena Flex strip on the both side of the stick with Elfy Or with any kind of same pasting glue comical. \n10.	Make small cut hole , holes will work as view finder for game area, as well as for wind crossing and for better mounting of blind on the ground.\n11.	Now your blind is ready to use according to your hunting area and situations.\n12.	This blind is very light weight and water proof plus long life, its also a good shield against cold winds.\n[u][b]NOTE:[/b][/u]\nIf you are not in practice with,  Adobe Photoshop tools  than you can visit only with your captured desired digital picture to you Pena Flex printer. They will design your print as you need. And designing price is in between 200 to 400. rupees. \n\nI hope that this tip will help to the all hunters and also its best for Wildlife observers and photographers.\n\n\nBest wishes for the current game season.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', ''),

(52730, ' In my humble opinion the mpi (mean point of impact) of the group is well below the center of the target. To me, it looks like a problem of sights (to start with in order to find an error). I suggest if the sights are adjustable then screw out the rear sight or raise the rear sight. If it is non adjustable then you have two options. One is to aim high and second is to see less of the front sight tip. Once you do that the barrel will bow down and in order to bring it on the target you will have to raise the barrel and hence the point of aim. Try that. If no improvement then we can say that there is some problem with the firer and then we can address the issue with more confidence. First rule out the possibility of an error in the gun because the guns can be zeroed quickly as compared to eradicating a fault in firer. So lets be sure where the fault lies.
