After this, the firearm is examined to make sure it is still intact and if so, the metal (usually the barrel) is stamped with one or more "proof marks" of the testing agency. The proof marks create indented impressions on the metal surface, so they cannot be accidentally removed. Such a test certifies that the firearm is free from manufacturing defects and will not explode under normal usage conditions.[/I][/quote]\n12G bhai, the context of my post was to inform Den bro that Nitro testing ( according to the link and a TV show on history channel)  has been replaced with CIP and SAAMI standards,according to what I know, I also asked to be corrected if I am mistaken.

(475055, 'ATM Skimmers; ATM users — beware of the skimmer; From the Newspaper | Ikram Junaidi | 2 days ago \r\n    27 \r\n\r\nISLAMABAD, Oct 21: Though a large number of accountholders have been deprived of their money by fraudsters through the automated teller machines (ATMs), it was perhaps for the first time that a citizen in the federal capital found a skimmer attached to an ATM. \r\nA skimmer can be fixed in the ATM slot for copying data from the card to make its duplicate and then steal money.\r\nTauqeeruddin, an electrical engineer and computer software manufacturer by profession, told Dawn that he went to an ATM at a commercial centre of the capital city to withdraw money at about 7:15pm on October 13 (Saturday).\r\n“I was shocked to see a skimmer installed on the ATM. I had read enough about skimmers but always wondered whether I would identify such a device if I ever come across it. It was so obvious, so fake and so cheap that it never looked like it belonged to the ATM,” he said.\r\n“I took courage to insert one of my old ATM cards to test it. An important point here was that it took a bit of effort to insert the card.\r\nHowever, the ejection was smoother and one would never think that it was coming out through a mischievous gadget. After taking a couple of snaps of the suspected skimmer, I pulled it out and kept it for an inspection,” he said.\r\nMr Tauqeer said he also reported the matter to the bank’s online staff. According to him, the skimmer did not have a camera but had a serial interface that could be used for retrieving stolen data through a computer or some other device. It had a small magnetic card reader head which copies the data when the card passes through it. “The skimmer had an Atmel Corporation’s tiny eight-bit microcontroller for processing and a flash disk capable of storing up to 2MB data. This meant that it could store information stolen from up to 30,000 cards,” he said.\r\n“It also had a mini-USB port for transferring the stolen data to a computer. The whole electronics was powered by a tiny 3.7V, 30mAh lithium ion battery which I believed could keep the skimmer running for several days. The cost of the whole electronics may not exceed Rs1,000. However, in the underworld, criminals readily pay between $1,000 and $20,000 to obtain skimmers of varying capabilities. The prices are cited from some internet posts,” he said.\r\nMr Tauqeer said the bank’s representative later called and requested him to hand over the skimmer to them. After filing a written complaint and getting a receipt, the skimmer was give to an official of the bank.\r\nWhen contacted, an officer of the bank requesting not to be quoted said: “We viewed the CCTV footage and saw that about 45 minutes before Mr Tauqeer’s entry into the ATM booth, a youngster, who could not be identified as he was wearing a P. cap, came to the ATM, fixed the device and went away.”\r\nThe manager of the bank said the device had been sent to their fraud department in Karachi, which would take necessary steps to ensure safety in the financial transactions.\r\nTahir Mehmood, a software expert, said ATM users should be careful while using their cards. Most of the skimmers do not match with the ATM’s original colour and material.\r\n“Look for threads, thin films, tapes or thin wires hanging or pasted anywhere along the edges of the slot. If you see them, do not use the machine. If you are not absolutely sure why your card was confiscated, immediately report to your bank, and get the card blocked. Some skimmers go to the limits of installing their own keypads over the original ones, so look carefully before you punch your PIN,” he said.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that on August 23 and 24 this year, more than 20 accountholders of a bank in Rawalpindi lost their money through the ATM and filed complaints with the bank.\r\nMohammad Rizwan, one of the affected persons, who lost Rs30,000, while talking to Dawn said: “After two month-long process, the bank has finally decided to pay 50 per cent of the amount to those who lost over Rs50,000 and 100 per cent to those who were deprived of less than Rs50,000. The management has assured us that the money would be transferred to our accounts within a few days.”\r\nInam Ghani, the director of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), told Dawn that their national response centre for cyber crimes (NR3C) dealt with such issues.\r\n“According to my assessment, this kind of fraud cannot be committed without involvement of bank employees. I have been working with the FIA for the last four years and received many complaints regarding banking frauds but no one has ever lodged a complaint about a skimming device,” he said.', 'ATM users — beware of the skimmer'),

If its not the case the firearm itself got no legal serial number, so it must be fake or having its duplicate moving in the earth somewhere else. \n\nOn the same line, your serial number is also registered with the License so how can you alter or remove it ?

In July  2010, the government started issuing computerised weapons licences with  watermarks and other security features.\n However, the Licence Branch at the DCO’s office has confiscated some  800 fake licences in the last five months from citizens who had  voluntarily come to get their licences verified. These fake licences  were made after July 2010, but were prepared manually. Government  officials believe that the licences were issued by licensed weapons  dealers.\n Tariq Zaman, the personal staff officer to the DCO, said that the  city government had decided to delay a crackdown on the makers of the  fake licences until it had gathered more evidence.\n “Even fake licences carry the dealer’s stamp. The more licences we  can look at, the more we will get to know of the arms dealers involved.  The decision has been made to lodge FIRs against these dealers so we  want to get as much information as possible,” he said.\n He said that anyone who turned in a fake licence for verification  voluntarily would not be prosecuted. But a gun owner who did not turn in  their licence for verification and was later caught would be  prosecuted, he said.\n An official said that there were a total of 55 licensed weapons  dealers in the city. He said no new arms sale licences were being issued  and these licences were not transferable. He said that the city  government knew of around 10 dealers who were involved in preparing fake  licences for their customers.\n The official said that under the rules, a new gun licence costs  around Rs5,000 and the process must be initiated by the licence seekers  themselves.\n The licence is supposed to be ready in 45 days, but applicants usually have to wait around three months.\n An official in the DCO’s office, speaking on the condition of  anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media, said that the  fake licence holders had claimed that they had obtained the licences  through their arms dealers.\n Most of them had paid Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 for the licences and had received them in a week.\n According to the official procedure, applicants for weapon licences  must first get a form, fill it out and get a picture taken at the  Licence Branch.\n The form must be signed by the DCO, or the official assigned the task  by the DCO. The form is then sent to the capital city police officer’s  office, which returns the application to the DCO.\n The file is then sent to the Pakistan Security Printing Press, Karachi, where the licence is made.', ''),

In July  2010, the government started issuing computerised weapons licences with  watermarks and other security features.\n However, the Licence Branch at the DCO’s office has confiscated some  800 fake licences in the last five months from citizens who had  voluntarily come to get their licences verified. These fake licences  were made after July 2010, but were prepared manually. Government  officials believe that the licences were issued by licensed weapons  dealers.\n Tariq Zaman, the personal staff officer to the DCO, said that the  city government had decided to delay a crackdown on the makers of the  fake licences until it had gathered more evidence.\n “Even fake licences carry the dealer’s stamp. The more licences we  can look at, the more we will get to know of the arms dealers involved.  The decision has been made to lodge FIRs against these dealers so we  want to get as much information as possible,” he said.\n He said that anyone who turned in a fake licence for verification  voluntarily would not be prosecuted. But a gun owner who did not turn in  their licence for verification and was later caught would be  prosecuted, he said.\n An official said that there were a total of 55 licensed weapons  dealers in the city. He said no new arms sale licences were being issued  and these licences were not transferable. He said that the city  government knew of around 10 dealers who were involved in preparing fake  licences for their customers.\n The official said that under the rules, a new gun licence costs  around Rs5,000 and the process must be initiated by the licence seekers  themselves.\n The licence is supposed to be ready in 45 days, but applicants usually have to wait around three months.\n An official in the DCO’s office, speaking on the condition of  anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media, said that the  fake licence holders had claimed that they had obtained the licences  through their arms dealers.\n Most of them had paid Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 for the licences and had received them in a week.\n According to the official procedure, applicants for weapon licences  must first get a form, fill it out and get a picture taken at the  Licence Branch.\n The form must be signed by the DCO, or the official assigned the task  by the DCO. The form is then sent to the capital city police officer’s  office, which returns the application to the DCO.\n The file is then sent to the Pakistan Security Printing Press, Karachi, where the licence is made.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nWhat about Karachi? Lunaticx and ED were of the opinion that we would have to wait till eid for resolution of the license issue and the parties involved would have come to conclusion on the ones getting paid and the ones shown the boot.\n\nDoes that mean that our processes will start after eid or that we will recieve our licenses after eid?', ''),

Case in point being posts # 3005 to 3007 of this thread. The same query from the same member being answered by one member in 3 separate successive posts made in the span of a few minutes. When, actually, the member asking the question should have searched the forums to get an answer.

In one case, a member with 300 plus posts announced that he had acquired his first firearm.

It does not need to wait for Tayyabally to send info to Caracal from Caracal''s own proforma invoices.\n\nCaracal also knows which production lots have possible problems. No research or analysis is required.\n\nIrrespective of how long a "fix" might take and whether Caracal will foot the bill or not, it is their duty to inform customers IMMEDIATELY if there is even the slightest risk of the sort that prompted a recall. So, if Caracal is a responsible company, the above would mean that all is well and there is no reason for Pakistani owners of Caracal products to panic.\n\nIn which case, one would reasonably expect them to make a categorical statement to this effect. That they have not done so would suggest to me that their legal counsel has instructed them not to. Until they make such a categorical statement in writing, they will remain suspect.\n\nHowever, since Tayyabally is the importer, they should bear in mind that they, as well as Caracal/Tawazun Holdings, will be the subject of criminal as well as civil proceedings in case anything untoward happens which is subsequently proved to be the result of wilful neglect/inaction despite sufficient cause (for these parties to have acted responsibly).\n\nOf course, the UAE does not care for Pakistan or its courts so any plaintiff (God forbid that there should be one) would need to find a legal angle allowing them to sue in a jurisdiction that is likely to be taken more seriously by them. That should be possible no matter what Caracal''s counsel may have advised them.

Also the trigger safety tension is very  light. IF the striker in fired position the trigger safety will  hold the pin in place , but a tap  pop the slide into   on the right rear corner of the slide, muzzle up, the safety will  bounce and allow the pin to withdraw.\n\nThe will also have to be looking at the  conditions needed to disengage the striker from the trigger bar.Looking at contact wear marks, it would seem to need more than  .015"/.020" vertical separation to disengage.This might be the reason why guns theoretically may discharge when dropped([U]Although hundreds of owners have reported testing their weapons and not have had a single AD[/U])', ''),

Depending on what bullets are used and where you can place your shots on the animal. I have always used softpoints( SP) and always taken them down with a good hit in the frontal parts (shoulder forward). Love the .222 due to hardly any recoil but would not recommend it as it is on the ''light side'' for new shooters who may not have gained expertise in bullet placement.  However, many people use the .243, .270, 7x57 , .308 and have great results.  For the past few years i have been using a 30.06 with SP bullets of between 150grn up 180 grns and have had great one shot downings.\n\nIf you can get your hands on a .308 or a 30.06, these would be the most versatile calibers for pretty much all hunts that you will engage in.', ''),

(475917, 'M1907 Dreyse Pistol (.32 Caliber) AoA All\nI wanted to share few pictures of M1907 Dreyse (.32 ACP), my much esteemed possession:) \nThe pistol was designed by Louis Schmeisser in the early 1900''s and originally developed for commercial sale. It was manufactured only 8 years from 1907 through 1915. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13983[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13985[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13986[/ATTACH]\nIt’s a blowback operated, semi-automatic pistol which is chambered in 7.65mm (.32 ACP) caliber. It was designed to operate as a striker-fired single action firearm. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13988[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13989[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13990[/ATTACH]\nThe sights include a blade front sight and a V notch rear sight, both of which have been milled into the pistol and are not adjustable. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]13982[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]13991[/ATTACH]\n\nThe magazine is a single column 7 round detachable box magazine. It has the old European style heel magazine release. \nThe manual thumb safety is located above and behind the left side of the grip and must be in the fire position before the slide is allowed to move rearward. The safety lever moves in a downward 180 degree arc. \n\nThis firearm does not employ a slide hold open mechanism to inform the operator that the last round has been fired. \n\nThere are 3 "crown over [B]N[/B] markings" that were stamped on German firearms manufactured before April 1, 1940. The Crown over N stamp indicates that the gun has been proof fired with a "nitro" propellant which is also known as smokeless powder. \nThe stamp is only applied to firearms that have successfully passed the proof firing test. The top crown over the letter N stamp is located on the slide, the middle stamp is located on the barrel casing, while the bottom stamp is on the frame.\nThe weight of the slide lies above the barrel and to some, Dreyse might seem like an awkward pistol as it’s grip angle isn''t quite right and it also feels top-heavy. Nonetheless, M1907 Dreyse was reasonably successful, considering that nearly a quarter- million were made.', ''),

A gun is like a car a very serious item; furthermore a car can be used for transport, however a gun?  is for taking a life... thats what its meant for.  If someone shoots a gun for plinking, hunting, or other sport they are simply sidelining what what firearms are meant for.  So when there is a defect in the running of your vehicle you immediately go to get it fixed.  SAME APPLIES HERE.  If they don''t wanna fix it free under warranty then its time to BOYCOTT the item in this country.  I am even with Caracal if they wish to sell us the replacement parts, hell, if I have paid 66000/rs then I can afford to pay 5000/rs more.\r\nThe other thing I CAN state to you all, the Caracals being sent to US are FAR more durable, robust, and safe than the ones sent here.  If Caracal is serious then they WILL address the issue immediately.  Otherwise, I AM going to request an outright BOYCOTT of this product BECAUSE EVEN AFTER HAVING AN AGENT FOR THEIR COMPANY IN PAKISTAN - THEY ARE STILL NOT GIVING POSITIVE PROMPT FEEDBACK...

(475977, ' [QUOTE=Sturmgewehr;313215]Sir no one is suggesting that Caracal is a wastefully bad hand gun[every new design needs to be tweaked over time even those big names had and still do have problems]. Its just that people who are in the habit of making unnecessary sweeping statements like the self written Wikipedia page distress me[its too positive and perky like the page for the AKDAL Ghost perhaps]...for unlike the rest they claim that they have pulled out all the stops and have done everything to make their products the best in the world....not saying that caracal doesn''t have potential to do it, no any manufacturer who works hard to achieve quality will give his customers a good handgun its just that they don''t seem to appreciate the depth and gravity of their claims...as Mr. Faisji said that even H&K doesn''t like subjecting their firearms to the D14 and that list of D14 approved lots is very limited in its scope[I am certain that they were lot numbers of made to order firearms for western military organisations,not meant for market consumption] so folks in short instead of making sweeping statements[the mark of immature people] one should act responsibly and stop claiming that all pieces to roll out of the factory are NATO D14 tested and approved. Would love to see those new rifles though lol.\n\nP.S I personally think that Caracal has awesome potential provided they learn from their mistakes and tone down the price tag to 50k, I''m certain Glock will become a scarce[even more then usual] item in the Asian continent if caracal plays its cards right.[/QUOTE]\n\nLike I said here in the above post.....we are overreacting....and seriously its like im yamering at a concrete wall at times......you know caracal pakistan owners and employees are "HUMAN"....they probably have "FAMILIES".....and im certain many of them are also muslims thus they "MIGHT BE ON HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE EID"...with their "KIDS,WIVES,MOTHERS,FATHERS and COUSINS" like most of "US"....lets subtract atleast 4 days out of that DDAY equation....but hell I dont mean that the bull shouldnt be grabbed by the horns I completely agree with Mr.Moeen and pro-activism members....they should provide the customer care and service over the prospect of which we drooled in our sleeps....[unlike most other brands]....Hope Caracal clears this mess up and grows up where those sweeping declerations and imbecilic remarks as to the infallible quality of their products are concerned and actually start competeing aggressively with Glock and SIG and all those fancy shmancy names in the market....\n\nas far as the metal, hammer stuff goes well I do support hammer fired and full metal guns but hey apples will be apples and oranges will be oranges....so lets not fight over such things like 12 year old kids who just hit puberty....it hurts the potential of our forum and the great changes it can produce in Pakistan''s private arms laws and market forces.', ''),

And I do agree with the essence of what your stated bro.\nHowever here are some of the Facts\n1. No one in PK has a reported failure. ( Abbas bhai did a bunch of drops tests as can be seen in the video, and it didn''t Fail in them)\n2. There is one Documented failure associated with the firearm reported on the 4th oct, and the company responded with a recall in the US with in two weeks of recieving the firearm that failed, and after inspecting it. ( in my books and by most definitions that is a reasonably responsible response.) \n3.Caracal Geman website also has no mention of a recall. Nor does Their distributors, in any other part of the world \n\nMy take on things ( speculations and personal opinion)  is Caracal got caught off guard with this AD business, not only are they understocked for spare parts and trained professionals, They were still in the process of establishing their operations in most countries. And I also hv a sneaking suspicion they might hv no idea what went wrong, or how and why they missed such a problem in the years of testing before the launch of their product. ( Again this is speculation on my part)\n\nKhair I am all for wait and see how this plays out. I am Hoping for a positive response.

And it an interesting read, hopefully people will read this with an open mind, and not take it as me defaming and or defending a firearm or the other. ( most reliable firearm design are a product of constant work/upgrades/redesigns/positive and negative feedback etc over a period of years ).   \r\n\r\n[b]In 1992 the DEA conducted a series of acceptance tests for new issue pistols, and the Glock failed a portion of the test colloquially referenced  as the frisbee test. It was an aggressive drop test which involved throwing G17s ~15 feet with a 4 foot drop. This simulates accidentally falling/tripping while carrying a pistol while at a full run. All first generation Glocks, and some second generation glocks (manufactured before april 0f 1991) have frame rails that are slightly too short. In the event of a violent impact (like being thrown 15 feet onto concrete) it is possible for the slide to separate from the frame, and make a light strike on the primer of a chambered round.\r\nIt is possible that the cartridge will ignite.[/b]\r\n\r\n(Another source) The test was repeated six times without an unloaded magazine and passed. Then a loaded magazine was inserted, and on the third through sixth time the gun failed.In the test, the frame separated from the slide with every pistol tested. This resulted in every pistol becoming inoperable due to rail failure and the testing for Glocks stopped immediately because no pistols could be made to fire.\r\n\r\n(another source)"In the DEA tests the slide came off the frame and the pistol discharged."\r\nAlso \r\nIn 1992 Glock announced a "voluntary upgrade" (really a recall, but they wouldn''t call it that) for safety and reliability, to replace those six parts.the firing pin, firing pin safety plunger, safety bearing and spring, trigger bar, and extractor were all redesigned to ensure it is impossible to accidentally discharge a round when the slide separates from the frame.\r\n\r\nSOurces of Info : Glocktalk, The AnarchAngel, XDtalk.\r\n\r\nNow the point being, Glock perfection wasn''t born out of design it was Achieved through hard work and Listening to feedback and continues till date with every upgrade ( which in some cases brings new problems too ).\r\nNow if only Caracal can hopefully, sooner rather than later, give us an explanation as to what went wrong in that one reported case of failure.', ''),

(476069, 'Glocks Drop safeties: Theoretical understanding &amp; Failures In the context of the recent Caracal drop safety issue, I thought this might be an interesting read,on How internal safeties work and what functions they perform in modern striker fired handguns.\nOriginally Posted by English (glocktalk)  \nAfter far too long a time it has dawned on me that the mistake in this thread has been to consider the "trigger" safety in isolation. [b]We should have considered the safeties of the Glock as a system.[/b]\n\nFirst, the Glock is intended to fire if you pull the trigger with a round in the chamber. The weight and length of trigger pull adds a small margin of safety against a "twitch" of the trigger finger but not much in comparison to a cocked and unlocked 1911. It has no where near the margin of a revolver in double action mode. If your finger is on the trigger when you are startled enough you are very likely to pull the trigger hard enough to fire the piece. To this extent, as many keep saying, the primary safety is between your ears. Handle the gun sensibly and you won''t have a negligent discharge.\n\n[u]Second, with the negligible exception of protecting against a push or pull against the side front of the trigger, all proper Glock safeties guard against drops, but not always as you might think.[/u]\n\n[b]A drop of a solid object onto a solid surface can produce remarkably high G forces[/b].\n\n[u]A drop where the pistol lands on the top of its slide could easily unsafe the firing pin safety as its inertia would easily overcome the spring loading[/u]. Fortunately the same G forces would push the trigger bar upwards, relative to the normal orientation of the pistol, and push it more firmly into engagement with the firing pin. So that is a safe drop orientation.\n\n[b]The most serious risk is from a drop onto the tail of the slide. Here the full mass of the trigger and trigger bar will be pushed back. If the impact is large enough then, without the trigger safety, this force could, in principle, push the trigger bar back far enough to act as though the trigger had been pulled.[/b] That is, it would disengage the firing pin safety, further cock the firing pin against its spring, cam the trigger bar down against the connector/disconnector and fire the pistol. [u]The trigger safety stops this from happening because it is in neutral balance against this force and its spring holds it in place[/u] unless the pistol is spinning very rapidly, as in the infamous Frisbee test. \n\n[b]Lastly we have the simply named drop safety[/b]. This provides a guide for the cruciform of the trigger bar which prevents it moving downwards until the trigger is pulled most of the way back. [u]Ostensibly this guards against an upward impact on the but of the pistol forcing the trigger bar down and releasing the partly cocked firing pin. What would happen if it did? The gun would not fire because the firing pin would be blocked by the firing pin safety which would be held more strongly in its safe position by this direction of impact.[/u] \n\n[b]So what is the drop safety for? It protects you from the circumstance where you drop your Glock, perhaps in the course of a fight, then pick it up and try to shoot. Without the drop safety the result might not even be a click because the firing pin would have been disengaged from the trigger bar cruciform by the drop. That is, the firing pin would be fully forward against the firing pin safety. If it is not partially cocked it will not fire! So the drop safety protects you from the gun not firing when you need it to fire rather than from firing when it shouldn''t fire.[/b] \n\nIt should be clear from this that the PRIMARY mechanical safety of the Glock against accidental discharge when the gun is dropped is the trigger safety. \n\nThere is no safety against it being fired once it is in your hand with your finger on the trigger and nor should there be. \n\nThere is no safety worthy of the name against discharge when something other than your trigger finger snags the trigger and pulls it back. This is actually a major failing of what is an ingenious piece of engineering. \n\nAll mechanical systems can fail and in this case we are trusting a lot to a small engagement of two pieces of cheap molded plastic. Apart from that the firing pin safety can get stuck in the up position if it gets too dirty, the firing pin/cruciform engagement can be insecure if it has been modified and/or damaged so that there is a very small engagement but this combination would also probably need a soft primer to fire. \n\nFor what it is worth, I do not believe that any pistol design solves the re:holstering/snagging problem in a reasonably fail safe manor. A manual or thumb safety will do so provided you remember to put it on safe every time you holster. The psychological fact is that the time you are least likely to do this is in the immediate aftermath of combat. This is also the time when you are most likely to be clumsy as you re-holster.', ''),

But, I am upset at Caracal and not at people who post here (unless, of course, they are rude). \n\nAnd, allow me to also clarify that I am not upset because of the money I spent on the weapon. It is the seemingly discriminatory attitude displayed by Caracal, so far, that makes me angry enough to post here. \n\nSo, unless someone helped design the gun or has a commercial interest in importing/promoting it, I fail to understand why they would be so militant and intolerant of criticism of Caracal. It is a weapon manufacturer for goodness''s sake. So, please allow me the right to vent here. Thanks.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nAllowed.....:) cheers mate....

(476123, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;291500]Tactical Arms: A review:\n\nOk I have been meaning to do this for quite some time.. A few weeks (Tuesday 31 July to be precise) back me and Canik and MIG took a trip to Tactical Arms. Its been quite some time sooo Canik and MIG Bros Kindly help me out a bit if I forget a thing or two.\n\n[B]First Impressions:[/B]\n\nThey have a pretty neat interior decorator. Lots of heavily armed guards outside. Excellent air-conditioning. Even more excellent goodies hanging on the walls and peering at us from under the glass tops.\n\nI saw a Vepr 12 MOLOT. Its proberly the best-looking shotgun a mortal has ever laid eyes on.. Compared to the quartet of little Saigas hanging under it she looked like a mother hen sitting her brood (One of the Saigas btw had a drum mag installed )But I digress..\n\nA salesman came up to us and asked us what we wanted. We identified ourselves as forum members and Vepr Lovers (in my case) Ok I didn’t really identify myself as a vepr lover. While Canik bhai and Mig were doing the things that reviewers do. I was busy ogling the vepr. Anyways back to the topic.\nI asked em to show me the TP 9. The sales man showed me a 2 tone piece. Asking 72k. I kind of lamented the fact that she does not have a safety lever :\n\nMe: Too bad she does not have a safety lever\nSalesman: We have a model that does\nMe: Umm the TP 9 does not come with those\nSalesman: Wait lemme show u one that does (starts rummaging around with boxes an stuff) opens a box goes” sorry it has been sold and puts back.\nMe: I’d still like to see it\nSalesman: Ummm\nMe: It did not have one did it?\nSalesman:( Ruefully) No\n\nMeanwhile we spotted a Desert Eagle that bore the legend “Made in Japan”… I had no idea the Japs were doin Deagles or for that matter any handguns since the 2nd world war. There were other Japs. Handguns there as well also manufactured in Tokyo. But we were not able to examine any of those.\n\nMe: May we see the Deagle? And how much does it cost?\n\nCanik: May we see the Deagle? And how much does it cost?\n\nThe salesman suddenly became very very very busy…\n\nSo Canik decided to take the bull by the horns and asked Mr. Rabbi Motiwala to give us some time if he could.\n\nWhen we introduced ourselves Mr. Motiwala informed us that he really doesn’t care what the forums write about him? He only cares for the customers in front of him I.e. u people are here ergo u are my customers. Why should I care who writes what. He further state that he only takes Rs. 5000/- per gun as profit. He also told us htat he had fired his previous salesman cause he was rude. And that is indeed his right. Can’t really argue with a man in his own shop who wants to eke out a living making a meager 5k a gun…\n\nCanik: Err if u take only Rs. 5000/- as profit, how can u sell local handguns some of which are available at 7 to 8k apiece.\n\nMr. Motiwala: We don’t deal in local weapons.\n\nWe all tried to avoid looking at the pile of local boxes behind the counter.. (Doubtless they were there to store the Jap. Deagles)\nWe also avoided looking at the double column Local TTs in the display case… (Proberly part of Mr. Rabbi’s personal collection.. A very patriotic individual indeed.. Since he sells imported stuff but keeps the locals for himself)\n\n[B]Prices:[/B]\n\nMr. Motiwala explained the concept of “Tag Prices” i.e. the price quoted by the salesman and the price at which he will sell. I guess his 5k profit margin applies to the sale price.\n\nThe Vepr 12 MOLOT..( I went up to her… and like a vision from somewhere up above… I found her in my arms courtesy the very obliging sales man.. She has some sort of tactical grip equipped with light and laser on her. While I was cuddling and caressing her I remember Canik arguing with Mr. Motiwala.. But the world had kind of blurred and I really don’t know what they were up to..) Then he quoted the price and I put her away in a hurry. The tag price (TP) 225k. Market tag price is 150k ( By Market price Tag I mean the world outside T.A)\n\nStoeger cougher without rails 68k tag price: market tag price 63k\nCaracal: 78k T.P and market T.P 72k\nCanik TP9: 72k T.P\nCF 98: T.P 44k M.T.P 42k\nGrips for hand guns: The smallest one 1.5 inch approx. (not Hogue) 6k Tag price\n\nUs: Rabbi Bhai your prices are higher. Much higher than the market..\n\nMr. Motiwala: I also run a gold jewelry business for women. Have been doing that for years.. Women bargain a lot. Men don’t!”\n\nDamn! All these years I thought I was a feminist.. It turns out I am actually “feminine” :S\n\n[B]Licensing:[/B]\n\nTatur1 ( A young member of this forum) had his first license made through their auspices : Tag price of the lic. 22k . Final price 20k .. Delivery in 20 days. Advance 10k. After 2 months he was required to re-submit his docs. He got the license after 2..5 months. Its Home department back dated from last year. Purchase period long since expired and no registration at the national bank. To be fair though Mr. Motiwala took 17k\n\nSince, DC lics are being issued why would he do this is beyond me. We took the license to Lucky star where Ali Muhammad and son’s manager (Nasir) has been trying to clean it up. We really hope that it actually has entries in the relevant places and is not just a book handed over to us. (Amount spent to date: 4.2k)\n\nMr. Motiwala refers to such licenses as “purchase ready”\n\n[B]My feelings:[/B]\n\nThe Vepr 12 MOLOT is an awesome weapon.. And as regards T.A great place to window shop..Especially if U are an avid bird watcher and have a thing for Japanese Desert Eagles\n\n[B]My recommendations:[/B]\n\nAvoid it if u are a newbie and have no knowledge of firearms. Even though it’s a nice shiny place with nice cool air conditioners and a 5 star type ambiance.\n\nHowever for those of us who know their way around the arms market.. Don’t worry about the prices, once u let them know that you have done your homework… They will reduce them.\n (Tatur1 was offered the Cougar or 60k at TA). And please don’t allow them to do your licensing for you.[/QUOTE]\n\ndidnt know Japanese made Desert Eagles...maybe its the Israeli Japanese haha...Desert eagles made in Israel only...yahoodis make it good stuff, I have seen Baby Eagle 2 and man oh man feels light in hand and runs like za zing...chrome line barrel, ok Ill stop :) Good review again bro', ''),

Royal Emirates is not a Dubai Government owned company. \n\nSheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum, one of the many members of the extended royal family of Dubai chairs the Royal Emirates Group.\n\nThe MD of Royal Emirates is a man called Dr Kaiser Rafiq (MBA, PhD). As you can see from the news item published in The National (dated April 23, 2011), questions have been raised in a respected UAE daily newspaper about claims that he made on his CV.\n\n[URL]http://www.thenational.ae/business/media/doubt-over-la-liga-football-deal-chiefs-cv[/URL]\n\n**************\n\n[URL]http://www.guillembalague.com/guestwriter_desp.php?id=27[/URL]\n[TABLE="class: tabla_central, width: 993"]\n[TR]\n[TD][TABLE="class: margen_3"]\n[TR]\n[TD="class: tabla_interior_centro"][TABLE="class: tabla_blog, width: 713"]\n[TR]\n[TD="class: cuerpo_blog, width: 100%, bgcolor: #ffffff, align: left"][COLOR=#ffffff][FONT=Arial][B]5/04/2011[/B][/FONT][/COLOR] \n\n[COLOR=#99cc00][FONT=Arial][B]Doubts grow over Getafe investors [/B][/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="colspan: 2"][COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial][COLOR=#333333]Over the past few days there has been some dramatic revelations regarding the sale of Getafe CF to the UAE based company, Royal Emirates Group. Here is a view from the UAE.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][I]By [B]Abdalla M. Taryam[/B][/I][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][B]\nWho is Royal Emirates Group? [/B]The premium business information portal in the Middle East, zawya.com, carries absolutely no information about this company or its subsidiaries. Its own website declares that the chairman is [B]Sheikh Butti bin Suhail Al Maktoum [/B]and its General Manager is[B] Dr. Kaiser Rafiq[/B]. Other than that, very little is revealed.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]\nButti AlMaktoum carries the title of Sheikh due to his relation to the ruling family of Dubai. Unlike Sheikh Mansour of Manchester City, he is an unknown individual mainly due to his tender age and lack of political weight.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]\nThe more intriguing character is Mr. Rafiq who through the several press releases seems to be the more influential individual. He boasts an incredible CV that was posted on Linkedin.com (recently amended), which included several educational degrees from renowned universities such as NYU, UCLA and Yale. UAE press has recently exposed him by verifying that he has never attended those universities. He also seems to have inaccurately overstated his work experience in certain American organizations that have never heard of him.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]\nVery few in the UAE media are convinced that a company that has no identified holdings can come out of nowhere and pull this deal off. It claims it owns 64 companies yet they disclose only 2 online businesses and the personal family wealth of the young Sheikh cannot be ascertained. Getafe&#8217;s future seems questionable at best.\n[B]\nAbdalla M. Taryam is a UAE based football commentator tweets @AbdallaTaryam[/B]\n\n[/COLOR][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n**************\n\nIn Pakistan, Fazal Jan Corporation''s website states that it has been authorised by Royal Emirates Group for sale of 9mm pistols to the Government and Armed Forces of Pakistan.\n\n[URL]http://www.fazaljan.com/services.html[/URL]\n\nThe company lists an address on Nicholson Road, Lahore as its office address and lists two cell phone numbers as its contact numbers.\n\n**************\n\nThe aftermath of the recent tender for KPK Police was handled somewhat amateurishly by Royal Emirates. It appears that they tried to bully the KPK government into buying Caracal and pretended to have clout where, in actual fact, they had little more than some nuisance value. \n\n[URL]http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-7-138680-Police-under-political-pressure-to-buy-UAE-made-Caracal-instead-of-Glock[/URL]\n\n***************\n\nTayabally''s website ([URL]http://www.tayabally.com/arm/index.htm[/URL]) does not claim that it is sole agent/distributor/dealer or whatever. That does not necessarily mean that it may not be any of the above. It may just be that Tayabally does not consider its relationship with Caracal LLC (through Royal Emirates) to be worthy of mention on its website (which, incidentally, mentions brands like Taurus, Daewoo, Beretta) or has been unable to update it.\n\nTipu had, once, mentioned that they had sent some technicians to Dubai to be trained by Caracal. That, by itself, does not mean much more than that some technicians were sent to Dubai for training (hardly nuclear technology) at Caracal UAE. \n\n Anyone willing to pay for it may also arrange for such training with Glock and Steyr (though, it is much cheaper to send people to the UAE in Caracal''s case).\n\n[URL]http://www.glocktraining.com/[/URL]\n\n*****************\n\nSo, it would be useful to know:\n\n1. Who actually represents Caracal in Pakistan as far as the ordinary consumer is concerned and what do they acknowledge to be their responsibility towards the ordinary consumer?\n\n2. What is said representative''s contractual relationship with Caracal LLC?\n\n3. What does Caracal LLC have to say about the guns bought in Pakistan by ordinary consumers with respect to:\n\n(i) any warranty that may be in place (who should one contact, for e.g., in case one wants to make a claim under the warranty)? and\n\n(ii) ascertaining whether any guns sold in Pakistan may be subject to the same issues as the ones voluntarily recalled in the US (irrespective of whether the Company intends to do anything similar in Pakistan, we have the right to know so that we may make informed decisions about safe handling of weapons).\n\n***************\n\nPlease feel free to question the above, challenge it, add to it but try to do so in a manner that is logical, knowledgeable and inoffensive...difficult but not impossible.', ''),

He declined to comment about the change yesterday.\n\n\nOn the new CV, he replaced a line about being a sales director for the property developer Toll Brothers and the vice president of sales and marketing at Trump Organisation in New York with a three-year job as director and partner of A to Z Consultants where he "worked with all major real estate developers including Trump Organisation and Toll Brothers". An official at Trump Organisation last week denied ever hearing of Mr Rafiq.\n\n\nMr Rafiq also replaced a section about being the chief executive of the UAE office of Prudential Real Estate, which he had described as an "American-based largest real estate brokerage", with an entry on his time as a partner of Prudential Brokerage with no reference to the US company.\n\n\nHe added a new company, Mega Sound, where he said he produced films for Zee TV USA. The country manager for Zee TV USA had refuted Mr Rafiq was a previous country manager, as he had said on the old version of the CV.\n\n\nMr Rafiq said he was the chief executive of Multinational House, a company that "successfully completed the project in Pakistan namely Project USAT 786" between February 2004 and January 2006. The entry has a recommendation from Issac Wright, the "VP Global Citizen Ship" for the Middle East for Microsoft, calling Mr Rafiq a "great negotiator, leader, presenter, and team player concurrently". However, the corporate office of Microsoft in Dubai said there was no one employed under that name or with that title.\n\nMr Rafiq did not remove references to a doctorate degree at New York University or a business degree from Yale University, despite both institutions saying last week they had no record of his attendance. He did, however, remove a reference to the subject of his purported PhD - "operations management" - and his membership at Yale of the "Skull & Bone", a reference to the secretive Skull & Bones society renowned for its elite membership.\n\n\nThe new CV was posted after Angel Torres, the president of Getafe, told reporters in Madrid the team had not yet been sold. Mr Rafiq said on Saturday night Royal Emirates "reaffirmed" it had bought the team and expected a press conference announcing the deal in Spain at 6pm today.\n\n**************************\n\n[B]EDIT:\n\nJust to connect the dots for fellow members who want to know the relevance of the news item quoted above. \n\nIt was, actually, posted in response to the following comment by fellow member Salman_Ahmed while commenting on an email by Dr Kaiser Rafiq of the Royal Emirates Group (which is said to be the sole agent of 9mm Caracal pistols for Pakistan):\n\n"I really doubt this guys is making stuff up,...."\n\nIt appears from the news item in The National (a UAE daily) that Dr Sahib is not entirely incapable of making stuff up. There has been no retraction or rebuttal of this story in The National.\n\nPlease see post # 1298 of this thread for further reference to the context.\n\nI posted some more information on the thread "DUTY or Caracal" (more freedom of speech on that thread than here :-)). Pls have a look if interested and add to it or correct it if you have more authentic information (pls cite the source).[/B]', ''),

Matter of fact caracal Pakistan could not import directly they import through dealers and keep their margin. None of the big importers showed their interest so they used small dealers import licenses. \nIn Khi no big party agrees to work with them. They are buying import lic of small importers only and changing partners after every import.\nit can be popular in Pakistan if initial price fixed under 50000. As per my info this pistol costs 36000/40000 to caracal Pakistan and after their commission it become about 55000/6000 for the dealers. This mean 15000 to 20000 to caracal Pakistan rep and over this for the dealers.\nthis is why no big party involved in the import . it is true when they can get in 55 to 60 in market then why they invest their amount. They get few pcs in 55/60 and sell in 65/70.\n\nThis pistol is quoted 270$ in KPK police tender.

(476602, ' You''re getting it all wrong my friend :) its [B]not[/B] the pellet [B]speed[/B] that causes damage/penetration but the [B]energy[/B] that pellet retains. So to cut a long detailed explanation (that is cooking in my head right now :p) short; [B]higher[/B] the pellet energy, [B]greater[/B] the damage.\r\n\r\nJust to give you an idea; imagine you have THE BEST powered springers. A pellet leaving the muzzle at 29.5 fpe (.22 cal - 15.5 grain at 925fps) will retain much more energy at 25 yards compared to a pellet that leaves the muzzle at say 19.5 fpe (.177 cal - 8 grain at 1050fps). As the pellet travels farther it rapidly loses energy. At such high speeds a lighter weight pellet will have much greater accuracy issues as well.\r\n\r\nI''ll quote a real life example too for your reference: some 2 weeks back I shot a pigeon at approx 25 yards with .22 cal gamo promagnum pellet. Aimed at its head and the bird instantly fell and rolled frantically on the ground, it was dead by the time I picked it up. Upon casual inspection I did not find any wound on the bird which left me greatly intrigued! upon closer look I found torn skin on the back of its head with [B]NO[/B] damage to the skull whatsoever. What really happened here was that the pellet hit the head and ricocheted off it due to the angle. The impact energy was however great enough to knock the bird off.', ''),

Its not like a .22 pellet stops on impact; it penetrates and causes much more shock/trauma compared to .177 cal.\n\nOn longer distance the .177 cal may not even wound a thicker skinned animal or as I previously stated, will leave a superficial wound. Lets put it this way, what will hurt you more; a 1" needle driven through the palm of your hand or a 1" nail :p?

However in guns producing over 20 ft-lbs of muzzle energy, you''re better off with a .22 caliber gun since its tossing the pellet fast enough (in the high subsonic range) to produce a trajectory flat enough for accurate shot placement while delivering the larger diameter, heavier pellet.

(476687, ' [QUOTE=Armughan;314806]I am sorry to bother you for a very basic query of mine and even more sorry if it has already been discussed somewhere in this forum and I skipped it. Why pump-action is preferred over semi-auto??? I mean we are talking about zombies apocalypse and in that case wouldn''t it be better to avoid consuming time on manual loading ... Can''t semi-auto be more efficient??? e.g. you have also reviewed Saiga which has 8 and 12 capacity mags easily available and its quite a reliable gun, so won''t the saiga with 8 or 12 cartridges be more effective than pump-action of 5 cartridges.[/QUOTE] \r\n\r\nThis part is mostly "personal preference". a semi auto is probably a better option if you are considering ability to dump as much lead as possible on a horde of approaching zombies. this is where a semi auto wins hands down.\r\n\r\nhowever:\r\n\r\nif you considering hiding and attracting less attention towards yourself and only use your weapon as a last resort then a pump action shotgun is definitely a better choice as it requires less maintenance and upkeep. similarly, the chances of a break down is far less in pump actions than autoloaders. remembers even the best gunsmiths in your area might already have turned into flesh eating zombies therefore they will not be able to offer much help to you.\r\n\r\nthen there is the issue of supplies and cleaning equipment to maintain your firearm. you must consider that your supplies will only last for a very short period of time.\r\n\r\nthen there is an issue of limited ammo supply meaning in the end you would have to resort to conservative measures. that means that you''ll be using your firearm only when absolutely necessary. again that means, that you would be hiding more instead of chasing after zombies. bottom line, you just cannot have enough ammo to chase after zombies who would probably number in millions.\r\n\r\nso, given all these circumstances, a pump action would beat any semi auto hands down. same is the case with handguns, a revolver would be much better in my humble opinion.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I felt very happy, when I was searching for some information online related to the procedure of issuance of an All Pakistan Arms License (APAL), and I found this useful discussion forum.  There is a lot of discussion on it, regarding the issuance of provincial and federal licenses. However, there is no authentic information or thread on this forum which explains and promotes the procedure related to issuance of an All Pakistan Arms License (APAL), without consulting the agents and paying them a huge commission/bribe.\n\nI was wondering if there are some people out there like me, who are really interested in getting an APAL by simply following the legal and actual procedure for its issuance? If there are a few, then I would definitely like to ask them, for a little help here, in the form of their useful contributions. I know it&#8217;s not an easy task but I am sure that with your help, we can turn it into an easy and smooth one, by collecting and putting the right information here and following it as well.\n \nI am creating this thread with the very basic information, which I found only on the website of Ministry of Interior Pakistan ([URL]http://www.interior.gov.pk/[/URL]). Although, there is not much information available but whatever I could find, I am putting it here. There is no further information such as proper mailing address for sending the form, fee information, application process, post approval process, payment of fees procedure etc.\n\nThe basic idea of creating this thread is to gather and post authentic information related to issuance of an  APAL. Please don&#8217;t post your questions here as we are simply trying to collect the relevant information here at this stage. When we will have enough available information, we would certainly welcome your questions and comments. What we need at this stage is your serious and committed contribution in the form of your relevant posts related to the subject only.

I''m neither experienced enough nor have the necessary tools to open up the air gun and lube tune it. I believe Umair Bhai can do it much better than a lot of gunsmiths here in Karachi; simply because air gunning is his passion and hobby :)[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nYou are always most welcome.  But there is a difference in tuning Diana54 and Hatson 125. \r\n54 gives no recoil or vibration to the shooter. All recoil is absorbed through the recoiless mechanism. So in tuning 54 we normally don''t need to change the spring. Otherwise the best option for tuning is to install a tune kit instead of original spring and guides.\r\n\r\nThis helped a lot in tuning his 54 as we had not to import any item.\r\n\r\nIn case of Hatson,  we can lube tune it. This will improve consistency and resultantly the accuracy. \r\n\r\nThis will help you hitting the target more accurately. \r\n\r\nYou are welcome but we would have to find a proper time slot as this exercise takes 2 or more hours. And yes Hatson is a new gun for me to open. I would have to be extra careful.\r\n\r\nI have also lube tuned Imdad''s 31. He is happy with his tuned gun.', ''),

Thank you for your kind words. Well, regarding my knowledge and experience, I will share it some other time (Though I am quite inexperienced). Regarding these weapons, coincidentally I saw them at National Traders 2/3 weeks ago when I was buying Caracal F for myself. Out of curiosty, I checked their prices.

(477100, ' AoA brother Leon,\r\n\r\nAll the relevant shooting gear purchases ultimately end at BUYER''S PERSONAL CHOICE/LIKING.\r\nForum members just add their own likes and dislikes.\r\n\r\nI do wonder,why the prospective buyers become too apprehensive about "RECOIL ISSUE" when\r\n98% of them seldom go for:\r\n\r\n1. High volume BIRD SAFARI in ARGENTINA or SOUTH AFRICA.\r\n2. High volume SPORTING CLAYS involving 200-shots a day.\r\n3. 500-cartridges per week on TRAP and SKEET.\r\n\r\n So, if somebody succeeds in getting a well fitted stock,recoil pad,good gun mounting techniques\r\n then he/she must go for A400 explor without (KICK-OFF).KO creates some sort of barrier in altering\r\n stock length.Since you have developed a liking for it and it falls in your budget,therefore in my opinion\r\n A400,would be the best choice.', ''),

Didn''t know the procedure, I thought would goto the dealer and buy. But the licensed dealer said that its not that simple and that I need a licence first. But he offered me that he would arrange that for me a about a month time (all Pak). So just waiting for the licences (2 Nos) only applied a couple of days back. I am thinking of purchasing a CZ 75 pistol (after ofcourse reading various threads on this useful site). Haven''t decided about the 12 bore semi though. Any suggestions would be welcomed.', ''),

(477712, ' I''ve neither used CZ999 nor CZ-P-07 Duty... But my cousin bought a Duty a month ago, two of my cousins went to a range, used POF in CZ Rami, CZ P07, Beretta 92FS and NP34... All guns apart from CZ P-07 fired well... After firing 10-15 bullets in P-07, there was an accident... My cousin (owner of P-07) heard a bang and a CRY... It was an over charged/ powdered round which P-07 couldn''t resist... the decocker and the slide stop lever flew away and the polymer frame of the pistol bulged from the right side... My cousin was slightly injured (thank GOD it wasn''t serious)... Most of the shells recovered were cracked... One of the shells got stuck in Beretta''s barrel i.e. the cap of the shell was separated and had been ejected out, the shell got stuck into the barrel... The next bullet failed to feed, upon inspection, it seemed as if there was another barrel inside the barrel (I hope you guys understand what I mean) so the armourer present there actually had to push it out with a cleaning rod... Basically it was ammo''s fault but apart from CZ P-07, all three pistols not only fired the rounds but held the "unreasonable/ extra" pressure of substandard bullets as well... After hearing all that, I would NEVER go for a P-07 rather CZ pistol in polymer frame... May be polymer used in Glocks, Sig, HK and Walther is of very superior quality... I remember shooting POF rounds in my Glocks, Walther, NP22 and CZ75B back in 2001... And I still remember that out of 50, at least 30 shells of fired bullets used to have big or small cracks... Since 2002, I''ve switched to Chinese ammo... So keeping this in mind, I would always go for CZ 999 instead of P-07, as I''ve never heard any such thing about CZ999...!!!', ''),

(477624, ' [the Corvair was a rear-engined economy car made by Chevrolet from 1960 to 1969, as General Motors'' answer to the Volkswagen Beetle.  Corvair fans and collectors are thought to be a little... strange.  I first saw this story in the rec.autos newsgroup in 2000, according to the timestamp on the file I saved it to.  Checking just now, it appears to have been originally written by Dave Barry, a Florida newspaper columnist.  I found the original for you - ]\r\n\r\n \r\nThis is why I believe that Nobel Peace Prize Handing Out Committee should consider giving a large cash award to the guys belonging to the Chicagoland Corvair Enthusiasts club, for their pioneering efforts in the area of  making vacuum cleaners explode.  \r\n  \r\nI am not making up these efforts: I have personally viewed them on a wonderful videotape that was sent to me by Larry Claypool and Kirk Parro, who are members of the Chicagoland Corvair Enthusiasts.\r\n  \r\n(Perhaps you are thinking that people who are enthusiastic, in an organized way, about Corvairs are perhaps - to use a psychological term - several drawers shy of a file cabinet.  Let me assure you that you are correct.)\r\n  \r\nHere''s the background: One day Claypool and Parro were reading a publication called Corsa Communique, which is the official magazine of the Corvair Society of America, and they came across an article headlined:\r\n  \r\nVACUUM CLEANERS AND SIPHONS DON''T MIX\r\n  \r\nThe article was written by a person named Chess Earman, who recounted what happened once when he was trying to siphon the gasoline out of one of his four Corvairs.  He didn''t want to get gasoline in his mouth, so he decided to get the suction going by holding the end of the siphon hose up against a vacuum cleaner hose.  What this meant, of course, is that he was sucking gas fumes directly into an electric motor, which as you know operates by having sparks fly around inside it.  So the next thing Chess Earman knew, there was an explosion inside the vacuum cleaner, and fire was coming out of the back of it "like a jet engine."\r\n  \r\nFortunately Earman was able to unplug the vacuum cleaner before anything really bad happened.  But this was indeed a chilling cautionary story about the extreme danger of messing around with gasoline and vacuum cleaners, and when Larry Claypool and Kirk Parro read it their natural reaction, as guys, was : Hey, cool.\r\n  \r\n"Such a challenge must not go unmet." is how they put it in a letter to me.\r\n  \r\nAnd thus it came to pass that, for a number of years during the 1980s, the big attraction at the annual Fourth of July picnic of the Chicagoland Corvair Enthusiasts was the Flaming Vacuum Cleaner competition.  I wish you could see the videotape, because it is difficult for me, using mere words, to convey the full flavor of the event.  But I will try.\r\n  \r\nEach year, contestants brought vacuum cleaners, which were grouped into teams under signs denoting their brands (TEAM HOOVER, TEAM ELECTROLUX, etc.).  One by one, these vacuum cleaners were brought out into the competition arena where they were introduced by an announcer over the public-address system.  The vacuum cleaner nozzle would be placed in a shallow pan of gasoline.  Then everybody would retreat to a safe distance, and the vacuum cleaner would be plugged in to a power source, causing the motor to start so the gasoline was being sucked in through the nozzle.\r\n  \r\nUsually nothing happened for a few seconds: then there''d usually be a BANG and the vacuum cleaner would jump a few inches into the air.  This always got a cheer from the crowd.  Various things would happen next, depending on the vacuum cleaner,.  Some models would emit a cloud of black smoke and stop running, causing the crowd to boo.  But other models would send out a jet flame shooting several feet out the back for several seconds.  A few hardy models kept running for several minutes: the longer they''d run the more the crowd would cheer, encouraged by the announcer.  Sometimes the flames would stop and inevitably you''d hear somebody - it always sounded like the same guy, a guy who has been drinking a lot of beer - shout "MORE GAS!" Certain canister models - these were the most popular with the crowd, getting wild cheers of approval - would explode violently apart with the tops flying up and out of the camera''s range of view.\r\n  \r\n"The canister tops often exceeded altitudes of thirty feet." report Claypool and Parro.\r\n  \r\nAfter each contestant was finished, it would be dragged off and dumped onto a growing, smoking mound of charred and mangled machinery, and the announcer would say something nice about it, such as, "Not bad, Electrolux Number Two!" or "Let''s hear it for the Eureka!"\r\n  \r\nOn tape, between contestants, you occasionally see women walk past in front of the camera, on their way to get some more potato salad or something: they sometimes look at the guys, who are working industriously away the way guys do when they''re on a Mission, getting another vacuum cleaner ready for action, and the women shake their heads in such a way as to clearly indicate that, yes, they knew guys could be idiots, but they had never realized that guys could be idiots of this magnitude.\r\n  \r\nAgain, these women did not understand that the Flaming Vacuum Cleaner competition was, in fact, a relatively positive activity for guys to engage in - that if the guys didn''t have this outlet, they could easily become involved in something with far more serious consequences.  I am sure that none of us wants to pick up our morning newspaper and read the headline that says CHICAGO FEARED VAPORIZED IN MISHAP INVOLVING EXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR-POWERED CORVAIR.\r\n\r\nNo, the Flaming Vacuum Cleaner competition was probably a good thing.  I want to stress, however, that it was also a very dangerous thing, not to be attempted by amateurs.  Remember that the guys who did it were not ordinary, untrained civilians: They were Corvair enthusiasts.  And they took certain critical safety precautions, such as rigging up a public address system.  You must remember that gasoline and vacuum cleaners do not mix, and under no circumstances should you attempt to do anything like this yourself.  And if you do, please let me know where you are.', ''),

(477766, ' [QUOTE=TRX;315793][the Corvair was a rear-engined economy car made by Chevrolet from 1960 to 1969, as General Motors'' answer to the Volkswagen Beetle. Corvair fans and collectors are thought to be a little... strange. I first saw this story in the rec.autos newsgroup in 2000, according to the timestamp on the file I saved it to. Checking just now, it appears to have been originally written by Dave Barry, a Florida newspaper columnist. I found the original for you - ]\n\n\nThis is why I believe that Nobel Peace Prize Handing Out Committee should consider giving a large cash award to the guys belonging to the Chicagoland Corvair Enthusiasts club, for their pioneering efforts in the area of making vacuum cleaners explode. \n\nI am not making up these efforts: I have personally viewed them on a wonderful videotape that was sent to me by Larry Claypool and Kirk Parro, who are members of the Chicagoland Corvair Enthusiasts.\n\n(Perhaps you are thinking that people who are enthusiastic, in an organized way, about Corvairs are perhaps - to use a psychological term - several drawers shy of a file cabinet. Let me assure you that you are correct.)\n\nHere''s the background: One day Claypool and Parro were reading a publication called Corsa Communique, which is the official magazine of the Corvair Society of America, and they came across an article headlined:\n\nVACUUM CLEANERS AND SIPHONS DON''T MIX\n\nThe article was written by a person named Chess Earman, who recounted what happened once when he was trying to siphon the gasoline out of one of his four Corvairs. He didn''t want to get gasoline in his mouth, so he decided to get the suction going by holding the end of the siphon hose up against a vacuum cleaner hose. What this meant, of course, is that he was sucking gas fumes directly into an electric motor, which as you know operates by having sparks fly around inside it. So the next thing Chess Earman knew, there was an explosion inside the vacuum cleaner, and fire was coming out of the back of it "like a jet engine."\n\nFortunately Earman was able to unplug the vacuum cleaner before anything really bad happened. But this was indeed a chilling cautionary story about the extreme danger of messing around with gasoline and vacuum cleaners, and when Larry Claypool and Kirk Parro read it their natural reaction, as guys, was : Hey, cool.\n\n"Such a challenge must not go unmet." is how they put it in a letter to me.\n\nAnd thus it came to pass that, for a number of years during the 1980s, the big attraction at the annual Fourth of July picnic of the Chicagoland Corvair Enthusiasts was the Flaming Vacuum Cleaner competition. I wish you could see the videotape, because it is difficult for me, using mere words, to convey the full flavor of the event. But I will try.\n\nEach year, contestants brought vacuum cleaners, which were grouped into teams under signs denoting their brands (TEAM HOOVER, TEAM ELECTROLUX, etc.). One by one, these vacuum cleaners were brought out into the competition arena where they were introduced by an announcer over the public-address system. The vacuum cleaner nozzle would be placed in a shallow pan of gasoline. Then everybody would retreat to a safe distance, and the vacuum cleaner would be plugged in to a power source, causing the motor to start so the gasoline was being sucked in through the nozzle.\n\nUsually nothing happened for a few seconds: then there''d usually be a BANG and the vacuum cleaner would jump a few inches into the air. This always got a cheer from the crowd. Various things would happen next, depending on the vacuum cleaner,. Some models would emit a cloud of black smoke and stop running, causing the crowd to boo. But other models would send out a jet flame shooting several feet out the back for several seconds. A few hardy models kept running for several minutes: the longer they''d run the more the crowd would cheer, encouraged by the announcer. Sometimes the flames would stop and inevitably you''d hear somebody - it always sounded like the same guy, a guy who has been drinking a lot of beer - shout "MORE GAS!" Certain canister models - these were the most popular with the crowd, getting wild cheers of approval - would explode violently apart with the tops flying up and out of the camera''s range of view.\n\n"The canister tops often exceeded altitudes of thirty feet." report Claypool and Parro.\n\nAfter each contestant was finished, it would be dragged off and dumped onto a growing, smoking mound of charred and mangled machinery, and the announcer would say something nice about it, such as, "Not bad, Electrolux Number Two!" or "Let''s hear it for the Eureka!"\n\nOn tape, between contestants, you occasionally see women walk past in front of the camera, on their way to get some more potato salad or something: they sometimes look at the guys, who are working industriously away the way guys do when they''re on a Mission, getting another vacuum cleaner ready for action, and the women shake their heads in such a way as to clearly indicate that, yes, they knew guys could be idiots, but they had never realized that guys could be idiots of this magnitude.\n\nAgain, these women did not understand that the Flaming Vacuum Cleaner competition was, in fact, a relatively positive activity for guys to engage in - that if the guys didn''t have this outlet, they could easily become involved in something with far more serious consequences. I am sure that none of us wants to pick up our morning newspaper and read the headline that says CHICAGO FEARED VAPORIZED IN MISHAP INVOLVING EXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR-POWERED CORVAIR.\n\nNo, the Flaming Vacuum Cleaner competition was probably a good thing. I want to stress, however, that it was also a very dangerous thing, not to be attempted by amateurs. Remember that the guys who did it were not ordinary, untrained civilians: They were Corvair enthusiasts. And they took certain critical safety precautions, such as rigging up a public address system. You must remember that gasoline and vacuum cleaners do not mix, and under no circumstances should you attempt to do anything like this yourself. And if you do, please let me know where you are.[/QUOTE]\n\nHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA....thats hillarious and I thought those anvils shooting competitions were weird...geez.', ''),

(477801, ' [QUOTE=SIGlock;315881]I''ve neither used CZ999 nor CZ-P-07 Duty... But my cousin bought a Duty a month ago, two of my cousins went to a range, used POF in CZ Rami, CZ P07, Beretta 92FS and NP34... All guns apart from CZ P-07 fired well... After firing 10-15 bullets in P-07, there was an accident... My cousin (owner of P-07) heard a bang and a CRY... It was an over charged/ powdered round which P-07 couldn''t resist... the decocker and the slide stop lever flew away and the polymer frame of the pistol bulged from the right side... My cousin was slightly injured (thank GOD it wasn''t serious)... Most of the shells recovered were cracked... One of the shells got stuck in Beretta''s barrel i.e. the cap of the shell was separated and had been ejected out, the shell got stuck into the barrel... The next bullet failed to feed, upon inspection, it seemed as if there was another barrel inside the barrel (I hope you guys understand what I mean) so the armourer present there actually had to push it out with a cleaning rod... Basically it was ammo''s fault but apart from CZ P-07, all three pistols not only fired the rounds but held the "unreasonable/ extra" pressure of substandard bullets as well... After hearing all that, I would NEVER go for a P-07 rather CZ pistol in polymer frame... May be polymer used in Glocks, Sig, HK and Walther is of very superior quality... I remember shooting POF rounds in my Glocks, Walther, NP22 and CZ75B back in 2001... And I still remember that out of 50, at least 30 shells of fired bullets used to have big or small cracks... Since 2002, I''ve switched to Chinese ammo...

To offer this design in 9x19 is apparently  the decision of corporate china . i am not sure whether this design has been able to inherit the qualities it possess in the caliber it was designed for , after its transformation in to a gun that chambers 9x19. I cant rule out the loss of some qualities and " guts" when a design made for a particular caliber is chambered in other .

All these guns fall in Rs. 65,000 to 85,000 range. If you have lower budget go for Chinese CF-98 or Turkish Canik-55.\n\nFor rifle, I would suggest you to go for 7mm rifle made by CZ as it is only rifle allowed on Punjab License beside it is economical to buy and shoot. Since you only need rifle for boar hunting, 7mm is sufficient. If you intend to shoot some other game, then you can consider .308 or 30-06 but those will be costly solutions as both rifles are expensive as well their ammo.\n\nAbove-mentioned are cost effective and best value for money solutions.

(477874, ' [QUOTE=SIGlock;315881]I''ve neither used CZ999 nor CZ-P-07 Duty... But my cousin bought a Duty a month ago, two of my cousins went to a range, used POF in CZ Rami, CZ P07, Beretta 92FS and NP34... All guns apart from CZ P-07 fired well... After firing 10-15 bullets in P-07, there was an accident... My cousin (owner of P-07) heard a bang and a CRY... It was an over charged/ powdered round which P-07 couldn''t resist... the decocker and the slide stop lever flew away and the polymer frame of the pistol bulged from the right side... My cousin was slightly injured (thank GOD it wasn''t serious)... Most of the shells recovered were cracked... One of the shells got stuck in Beretta''s barrel i.e. the cap of the shell was separated and had been ejected out, the shell got stuck into the barrel... The next bullet failed to feed, upon inspection, it seemed as if there was another barrel inside the barrel (I hope you guys understand what I mean) so the armourer present there actually had to push it out with a cleaning rod... Basically it was ammo''s fault but apart from CZ P-07, all three pistols not only fired the rounds but held the "unreasonable/ extra" pressure of substandard bullets as well... After hearing all that, I would NEVER go for a P-07 rather CZ pistol in polymer frame... May be polymer used in Glocks, Sig, HK and Walther is of very superior quality... I remember shooting POF rounds in my Glocks, Walther, NP22 and CZ75B back in 2001... And I still remember that out of 50, at least 30 shells of fired bullets used to have big or small cracks... Since 2002, I''ve switched to Chinese ammo... So keeping this in mind, I would always go for CZ 999 instead of P-07, as I''ve never heard any such thing about CZ999...!!![/QUOTE]\n\nVery strange.

The court had then directed Sindh police chief  Fayyaz Leghari to submit a detailed report in this regard.\n During the previous hearing, Inspector-General of Prisons Zafar Abbas  Bukhari has presented to the court a list of 193 convicts and 35  under-trial prisoners who were released on parole since 2003.\n Commenting on the report, Justice Jamali has remarked: “This is a  very serious issue. It seems a parallel judicial system is being run by  the home department and convicts are being released even after their  convictions are upheld.”\n The bench, in its short order on Saturday, ordered that the 35  under-trial prisoners released on parole be arrested on immediately. It  further stated that the police and other law enforcement agencies had  failed in providing security to the citizens.\n The court also directed the Sindh government to take immediate steps  to protect the citizens against targeted killings. Moreover, [SIZE=6][B][FONT=century gothic]the court  also ordered that all firearm licenses should be computerised within  three months and all previous non-computerised licenses be cancelled.[/FONT][/B][/SIZE]\n\n The interim verdict also ordered authorities to take action against  illegal unregistered vehicles in the city, directing the government to  implement its all of its directives within three months’ time.\n\n\n[url]http://dawn.com/2012/11/03/sc-orders-action-against-taliban-armed-groups-in-karachi/[/url]', ''),

(477930, ' [QUOTE=SIGlock;315881]I''ve neither used CZ999 nor CZ-P-07 Duty... But my cousin bought a Duty a month ago, two of my cousins went to a range, used POF in CZ Rami, CZ P07, Beretta 92FS and NP34... All guns apart from CZ P-07 fired well... After firing 10-15 bullets in P-07, there was an accident... My cousin (owner of P-07) heard a bang and a CRY... It was an over charged/ powdered round which P-07 couldn''t resist... the decocker and the slide stop lever flew away and the polymer frame of the pistol bulged from the right side... My cousin was slightly injured (thank GOD it wasn''t serious)... Most of the shells recovered were cracked... One of the shells got stuck in Beretta''s barrel i.e. the cap of the shell was separated and had been ejected out, the shell got stuck into the barrel... The next bullet failed to feed, upon inspection, it seemed as if there was another barrel inside the barrel (I hope you guys understand what I mean) so the armourer present there actually had to push it out with a cleaning rod... Basically it was ammo''s fault but apart from CZ P-07, all three pistols not only fired the rounds but held the "unreasonable/ extra" pressure of substandard bullets as well... After hearing all that, I would NEVER go for a P-07 rather CZ pistol in polymer frame... May be polymer used in Glocks, Sig, HK and Walther is of very superior quality... I remember shooting POF rounds in my Glocks, Walther, NP22 and CZ75B back in 2001... And I still remember that out of 50, at least 30 shells of fired bullets used to have big or small cracks... Since 2002, I''ve switched to Chinese ammo... So keeping this in mind, I would always go for CZ 999 instead of P-07, as I''ve never heard any such thing about CZ999...!!![/QUOTE]\n\nFrame buldge from right side is a known issue / flaw in p07 Duty. and yes the polymer is of lower quality which is proven by squeezing the grip of pistol after removing the magazine. u ll notice that the grip does not have the integrity to maintain shape unlike anyother polymer pistol. Frame buldge has been reported by most of duty owners all over the world.', '');

Sending a 40gr projectile at 2000fps is no small task and that alone has me interested along with the low recoil. That being said, I would not consider it a SD/HD weapon as it would lack the stopping power of the bigger heavier bullets but it is said to be able to also send a JHP AT 1800 FPS so that bit does have potential. Depending in the price of the ammo, it can also prove to be a fairly decent competition weapon.\nI intend to get it if/when the ammo availability is confirmed so this is me putting my money where my mouth is.', ''),

Hard rubber head hammer.\n3. Screw loosning lubricant or spray(WD-40,brunox etc.)\n4. Set of punches to remove pins for taking out firing pins.(Clogged if not broken).\n\n Open the Trigger guard to expose another screw under it,it should now dislodge the stock out\n of action.Find the screw holding the top lever,Inspect it whether you find a loose bolt or cracked\n part.Try to thoroughly clean the whole action with DIESEL and operate the TOP lever after TIGHTNING.\n\n Repeat the same process for firing pins,inject diesel with a SYRINGE from outside and shake it well to\n dry out the action,although DIESEL has lubricating qualities also.Now operate the lever and do the coin "TOSS" check\n with firing pins.\n\n Without fixing stock,assemle barrel and forearm,just to load the hammers,Disassemble again and place any\n coin over firing pin hole and press the triggers turn by turn in order to check whether strikes of both pins are\n equal or not.\n\n In any case,you fear to ruin your gun, then go to Mr Akram (Basement Buksh Elahi-Lahore) to get the good repair\n job.', ''),

You can consider other caliber as well like .40 or .45ACP but models number may vary with caliber.\n\nFor rifles, intially you can go for 30-06 or .308win. 30-06 is considered favourite among hunters and there is no game in Pakistan which you cannot hunt with either of these. But you need to get MOI license and lot of effort to get it registered (as many authorities consider rifle as PB.)\n\nFor rifles of these calibers, you have to search as these are rare in Pakistan these days but you may get these.

If your pistol has a different serial number, it is not subject to the recall. \n\nIf you own a Caracal F or C pistol with a serial number identified as being affected by this recall, please do not load or fire your Caracal F or C pistol and contact us immediately to arrange to have the trigger unit replaced, completely free of charge, using the following steps:\n\n Step 1 - Contact us at 205-655-7050 (Monday-Friday 8-5 Central Standard Time), or at [email]info@caracal-usa.com[/email] and provide the model and serial number of your pistol. \n\nStep 2 - After contacting us, we will send you a prepaid overnight shipping box with instructions so that you can return your pistol to us, free of charge. \n\nStep 3 - Your firearm will be returned as quickly and efficiently as possible. \n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause, and to thank you for your patience and cooperation, we will send you a free magazine when we return your pistol to you. \n\nFor more information, you may visit [url]www.caracal-usa.com[/url] or call Caracal USA at 205-655-7050', ''),

This man has a workshop set inside his small shop and has a single helper. &#8220;I produce Kalashinkov (AK-47) rifles and 12 gauge shotgun rifles in the Kalashinkov design,&#8221; said Farid Shah.\nReplying to a question about the quality of his guns, he simply said that his guns were no match for the Russian, Chinese or Pakistani guns produced in Wah Ordnance Factories.\n&#8220;A gun made manually from ordinary steel manually cannot match a gun produced in a well equipped factory from weapon grade steel using computerised machines,&#8221; claimed Farid, adding that his guns were bulky and since there is no standardisation in the workshops, it is not possible to replace parts.[/quote]\n\n[Quote]Shah Nawaz Afridi &#8220;There is a myth that gunsmiths of Darra can produce even atom bombs. In fact they cannot even produce a serviceable AK-47 automatic rifle!&#8221; he says, referring to the famed gun that is the weapon of choice for insurgents and terrorists the world over. &#8220;You can&#8217;t be a terrorist by using weapons of this poor quality,&#8221; he says with finality.[/quote]\n\nThis is Probably the Single most important Quote from All of that article: \n\n[Quote]Among Shah Nawaz Afridi&#8217;s pet peeves is that the government simply has not had the imagination to harness the potential of these weapon makers.\n&#8220;Take Faisalabad, for example. It is a small city which has become the hub of the textile industry; the government established a textile engineering college to support the industry, thus making it one of the most industrialised cities in the country.&#8221;\nIn contrast, he says, Darra&#8217;s skilled gunmakers have been completely ignored. &#8220;They could have established an engineering college in Darra to support the local industry to help it become world class, but that did not happen.&#8221;\nHe even has an argument to counter those who say that weapons manufacturing should not be encouraged.\n&#8220;If you want these gunsmiths not to produce guns, you should train them to manufacture auto parts or other useful things. They could be trained to produce air rifles, but do you know not a single unit in Darra produces air rifles despite the fact that a world class airgun is sold at $500 a piece on the international market as compared to $50 in the case of a TT pistol?&#8221;[/quote]', ''),

All I''ve to say is NP22/34 are tried and tested weapons by many seasoned members... The reason why I would prefer NP22/34 over HP77B is: I''ve used both the the models ie.NP22/34 and besides that, one can find lots of "commendable" reviews about these two models...

I am not saying that NP22/34 are not tried and tested and I am certainly not promoting HP77B over NP22/34. all I am saying is that CF98/NP42 are officially adopted firearms whereas NP22, HP77B and NP34 are mere clones.\r\n\r\nif I were to decide between HP77B and CF98/NP42, I would certainly pick CF98/NP42 it is the officially adopted firearm of the world''s largest army. that alone is a major plus.\r\n\r\nsecond reason for me not picking HP77B and NP34/22 is the fact that they are low quality clones of a very high quality handgun. sure, at times a clone can be better than the original but I am afraid this is not the case here.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Show your cNIC again at the gate. Find out where the Home sec sits and hten convince his PA u need a meeting with the big man. Once u get the meeting.. U can then try and convince him that U need a firearms license.\n\nUsually a copy of your job letter and visiting card as well as a reason for a weapon.. that is all that is necessary.

He will then issue u a paper which u wil then need to take to the DIG operations.\n\nGo and meet the PA of the DIG and convince him that u need to visit the great man. And once U have a meeting with him then try and convince him that u need a fire arms lic. Once u have his approval get in touch with the Spacial branch i think it is also the DIG there and again the PA and the whole thing all over again.\n\nThen it wil be the DIG CIA and his PA. . However the CIA has issues with the home dep these days. So u need to convince him that u need his approval without telling him the Home Sec wants it..\n\nhow u do it is your responsibility. Then it wil be the SSP operations and his PA. all the way down to the SHO of your area. He will then send an ASI to your home to verify your antecedents. usually the ASI wil also need CNIC copies of your neighbours as character certificates. U will then need to convince the ASI to write a good character certificate.\n\n\nOnce he does write it then it is his responsibility to give it to teh SHO whose responsibility it is then to write a favourable report for the Sp who wil then write a favourable report for the SSP Ops. who will then send a favourable report to the DIG operations. How htey write these reports is not your responsibility u can try visiting them and asking them to do it but that is it.\n\nThe DIG ops will the send the report to the Home Sec. U may try and keep visiting the home sec to know if they have received the favourable reports.. Once they do so. U wlil then be asked to give the fees i.e Rs. 4500 and then u will have to submit your data personally i.e photo wil be taken finger prints and personal data such as how much u earn and where etc etc.\nU will then be issued a token and will then need to visit repeatedly to know when your lic wil be ready. Once it wlil be ready and u will take delivery then U wil buy the weapon and take it back to the home dep and they wil make an entry on it.\n\nlater U wil need to visit the Home sec. so that u can convince him that u need a 144 carry permit for at least 90 days.

I''ve currently taken out of my weekly range circular sessions to make room for other weapons in my collection.\r\n\r\nregards[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, to be honest, we really should not refer to CZ999 Scorpion as a clone of SIG. if we must call it anything then in my humble opinion it should be referred to as an improved SIG. now I am not saying that it is better than a SIG, all I am saying that there are certain enhancements in Scorpion which are not present in SIG. such as:\r\n\r\n1. internal extractor: it offers much better and more reliable extraction (in theory atleast) as the extraction claw is near to the axis of the bore.\r\n\r\n2. mainspring inside the alloy frame vs outside the frame mainspring of SIG: inside the frame should be more secure than the one covered/protected by plastic grips only.\r\n\r\n3. ambidextrous controls: this makes the gun equally usable for left handed shooters.\r\n\r\n4. single slide release and decocker lever vs separate levers in SIG: it makes operating the handgun a lot less complicated. in my humble opinion, this is probably the best enhancement in the scorpion. both functions are integrated into one lever to simplify operation..... and that lever is ambidextrous too. :)\r\n\r\n5. internal and external chrome lined barrel vs internal-only chrome lined barrel of SIG: I cant say anything for certain here but an internal plus external chrome lined and hammer forged barrel should be (atleast in theory) better than an internal chrome lined only hammer forged barrel.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

He is in serious range shooting plus in practical shooting. If cz999 is not a clone of sig then why sarsilmaz or canik is a clone of cz75.

U can then try and convince him that U need a firearms license.\r\n\r\nUsually a copy of your job letter and visiting card as well as a reason for a weapon.. that is all that is necessary.

He will then send an ASI to your home to verify your antecedents. usually the ASI wil also need CNIC copies of your neighbours as character certificates. U will then need to convince the ASI to write a good character certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce he does write it then it is his responsibility to give it to teh SHO whose responsibility it is then to write a favourable report for the Sp who wil then write a favourable report for the SSP Ops. who will then send a favourable report to the DIG operations.

U may try and keep visiting the home sec to know if they have received the favourable reports.. Once they do so.

We used walk a certain path which was 4 / 5 kilometers long and used to reach our home in the village in the afternoon (by Asaar prayer). Some people had planned to attack us. They knew our path and arsenal (an air-gun and a knife). The plan, which we quite later found out, was to kill us with axes. On that lucky day, we were carrying our new 0.22 semi-automatic rifle also. When we started walking, we had some fear at our heart which we had discussed with each other and it was decided that we nervous because of our first day out with the rifle. When we reached that specific area where we were to be attacked, I saw a dove on the ground and I was aiming for the dove with air-gun when the attackers suddenly came out of hiding and started warning us to not to run. The distance was 30 / 40 feet. It took us 3 / 4 second to realize the situation and that too after seeing revolver in one of the attacker''s hand that we are in trouble. At that time, .22 was with my younger brother and was un-chambered with safety on (in accordance with our training by our grandfather which I will discuss some other time) and I had loaded air-gun. After that all we remember is pointing my air-gun towards them and hearing my younger brother chambering the rifle and firing all 10 rounds at them. It was surprise for them that we had rifle. Secondly, they mistook my Crossman (Classic / Variable Pump which look like rifle from the distance) air-gun for another 0.22 rifle. Though, the main culprit fired 2 /3 round at us but luckily did not harm us nor our bullets harm them except a minor flesh wound to one of the attacker. Our initiative had made them run away.[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial][SIZE=2][COLOR=#000000] [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Arial][SIZE=2][COLOR=#000000]Anyhow, after the incident we somehow gathered our senses, loaded our weapons and reached our village all most running and informed our father.

I used to travel between our town and two pieces of land very often and used to carry TT for protection from boars. One day, I was going to our new land on motorcycle from our village after attending a Punjait (Village Committee) in which one of the parties had felt offended due to unfavorable verdict. When I started journey I was prepared for any adverse situation as I was expecting some brawl. Before that when I reached village in the morning, I saw 2 suspicious persons on the motorcycle on the corner of our village staring at me. When I started journey back, they were still there. Once I passed by them, they slowly started following me but at quite a distance (around 300 meters). I paid little attention to that. Around 2 kilometers from the village, there is a turn and crossroad (from where dirt track leading to our second land used to start). At this place road is covered by sand. There, I saw 2 other persons on bike and also realized that the motorist on my back are also closing in. I started feeling some fear but I took the turn on dirt track and tried to pick up some speed. I again noticed that both motorcycle are now after me and are closing in. I suddenly made the decision; I stopped, threw motorcycle on the track and ran around 15 / 20 feet into jungle. Meanwhile, I took out my TT, chambered it. I saw those persons stopping, taking out TTs and started looking around. I fired some shots into the air upon which they fired 3 / 4 shots here and there and then ran away on their bikes. I remained there for around 10 minutes waiting for them to return.

I was leaving for my office from my home (a flat complex in centre of the city). I had sold my car so I had to take rickshaw. My office was at exactly one mile from home. I waited for rickshaw for 10 minutes then in decided to take rickshaw from the corner of the street. The guard of the building asked me to wait for rickshaw but I left. Before that I noted 2 suspicious persons on bike. Then I don&#8217;t know what came in my mind that I left the gate. When in took the turn I realized that entire street is deserted and I am alone. And there came those motorcyclists. At first sight, I realized that I am in trouble but I could not run away as I was in the middle of the street with nothing to hide or take cover. Secondly, I did not have any weapon on me at that time. It took them 7 to 8 second to reach me, draw the pistols, chambering them and putting one on my forehead and the other on my ribs. I kept the cool and handed over everything in my pockets to them. Then suddenly, I person came into the street and after seeing that he started shouting. The muggers started firing at him and in the air. However, I took 2 / 3 steps back and remained standing there. I knew it was not good time to run or shout. After firing some shots they ran away.

EVERYTHING is possible in our beloved Pakistan.. If zardari can go from jail to president house.. phir kyaa reh gaya??\n\nSecondly, if anyone else is here from ASCC gun range they can tell you on practical shooting practice how the rounds fly through the air... let me give an example.. take el presidante drill.. 12 rounds max avg time taken is 9 seconds.. you do it 5 times 60 rounds gone.. target transition, reload and then the double tap target transition.. on the move .. means at least 30 rounds in 15 seconds.. do that 5 times.. 150 rounds pass, this brings the total to 210 rounds in just couple of minutes..\nThere are some days when NO regular member comes and we shoot to our hearts content.. that is when practice happens..\n\nI just can tell too much but soon.. you will see the IPSC and IDPA drills as done in Karachi.... in small clips uploaded on FB on the Pakistan national practical shooting association page. i.e. [url]https://www.facebook.com/NationalPracticalShootingAssociation[/url]\n\nToday whole day i was busy with the upcoming shooting event that is in the pipe line soon you will see another event on TV and this time it will be really Grandoise. THAT is a PROMISE. I will participate with my NP22.\nIt has a lot of wear showing on the under side of the slide just in front of the chamber..\nNO ONE is saying that NP 22 is unbreakable pistol.. you need to clean it properly on the first instance you feel it has grit developping.. I clean it TWICE during shooting with WD-40 when shooting about 1200 rounds in a day.. It is almost a torture test. we get tired severely but doing the exercises from the Steven andersons book makes it imperative that we do things properly and practice accordingly.\n\nRange shooting as in PRACTICAL shooting is a LOT different that just target shooting.. let me give you an example.. in target shooting day i seldom cross the 80 shots per day level.. on Practical shooting i easily cross the 450 shots mark. IF all the friends are there then 1000 mark is reached..\n\nMy first gun.. was a LOCAL made pistol in .45 cal.. just to carry.. but due to cost i sold it.. then i went for CF98.. within 24 hours i was on the KARSAZ range with a member and shot almost 300 rounds of POF through it. sold it the next day for NP22 and never looked back.. i also had taurus PT909 and 24/7 in .45 cal at the same time.\n\nCF 98 is a very complicated design and it has PLASTICS used.. and steel rail is pivoted at rear and fixed by the locking pin. with heavy use and as a military use pistol the slide to frame fitting is always kept LOOSE. that is because it is a MILITARY design. IT IS NOT designed for heavy use.. but is for once or twice use in the field where dirt or grit would let it function.. that is why the barrel life is 8000 rounds.. now go and get a new barrel .. IN PAKISTAN.. can you do that??\n\nhowever YOU CAN DO THAT WITH NP22.. you can put in original SIG barrel that is imported at a high cost of 400 $ roughly.\n\n"My NP22 is SHOWING signs of wear and tear and cannot be used for target practise but is excellent in the condition as it is for the Practical shooting".\n\nTHERE is NO comparision of CF98 with NP22.. it is injustice to NP22 as it is a well tested design.. so what if chinese government chose it for the infantry... NP22 design was chosen by US NAVY SEALS about 35 years ago.. and STILL it is used as the primary choice.. BEAT THAT. Chinese make excellent barrels.. i had read somewhere that NP22 was selling better than SIGS mainly because of the great input from the people using it in the north americas.', ''),

I was trained (I am not LEA or trained by LEA) not to carry chambered gun and I am not in favor of carrying chambered guns all the time. Yes, you can carry chambered gun when you are going into high threat zone or you have certain knowledge.

The situational analysis do work and sometimes your sixth sense also. But if it is a surprise and you have been taken at gunpoint then my friend you have lost.

It wouldn''t have been justice if I missed the ''eye shot'' so I decided to get a small pig with an eye shot. Found some but they ran into the woods as soon as I turned the torch on. Went a bit ahead, saw a pair of jackals at just the jungle''s ending. Turned light on, one tottered away into the woods maybe it was frightened, second one sat down on the front feet. I took my time, scope at 4x magnification, aimed in the left eye, target was about 15yds away "[B]Tic[/B]" was the sound of the silenced gun and down went the critter. Clean kill, 1 shot got the job done.\nPest control with airguns, more fun than shooting jackals like they do the conventional way, with AAA or SG 12ga ctg, without even proper aiming.\nAll you need is an accurate shot.[/QUOTE]\n\nThat''s what you call "Bull''s eye" ............', ''),

Its not just the barrel which makes a quality firearm. :)"\n\nBrother the quality firearm has three main things.. 1) barrel quality (i.e. insides) 2) Barrel to slide fitting/ slide to frame fitting and 3) the most importantly the sear and trigger group. There is a huge difference between SIG P226 and SigX6. Even though they are from the same manufacturer. However if you can fit in the barrel from SIG into the NP22 or HP77 then i am sure it would be a LOT better in condition than with Chinese barrel. If you have had some experience with polishing the sear or the trigger lever you would know the minute detail that goes in the quality. You are correct in the sense that it can never be compared to an original SIG but can you compare a 300000 rupees gun with 27000 rupees one??? This can never be a discussion it is waste of time for obvious reasons.. but when you are changing the barrel you are trying to make an average gun try to become as nearer to an original as possible. This will rejuvenate the life for couple of thousand rounds and a learning experience.\n\n12Gauge said: "Bro, here I would agree that NP22 is based on a SIG P-226 which definitely is a well tested design. however I am unable to understand why CF98 is an untested one? ;)"\n\nCF98 is a rotating barrel design, and has a small block that does the work. In most of the pistols it is an integrated block that does the same work but in CF98 it is done by a separate free floating block. The insides are very rough and the quality of the finish leaves almost everything to be wished for. Do something.. strip the pistol apart completely and take out each and every part and then reassemble it. THIS will show you the reality of what a well tested design means. Secondly the finish is what tells the quality of the gun.\n\n12Gauge said: "so the same rules/principles that apply to Chinese military in selecting a handgun do not apply in the case of US Navy Seals? are you under the assumption that it is only the practice of chinese military to adopt a handgun is based on political reasons? ;)"\n\nWell it was a reason why beretta was selected for US army for POLITICAL REASONS. however Navy Seals remained away being the elite. Chinese military has also special forces .. see which gun have they selected for their ELITE. comparing the gun of US elite with the gun of chinese infantryman.. seems odd to me.. even otherwise let me tell you something more. Selection of a weapon has got more things than can be written here. I can expound some.. such as Economy of providing 1.2 million pistols versus using a 10 times expensive pistol. You DO NOT go to war with a pistol rather it is just an item so that the infantry man can get to his rifle, i.e. ak-47. Nowadays the war is always at a farther range.. think Sniper.. and what will a SIG do when there is a sniper in front hiding??? SO the best option is have a gun which is excellent for short combat couple of times. However the navy seals use their pistols fitted with sound supressor very OFTEN and need a very refined design with very good accuracy.. think P210 design here.. THAT is why they have kept stuck to one design for so long.\n\n12Gauge said: "Bro, thats not a sign of quality or repute. clones almost always sell more than the original. why? because of the price difference. perspective customers are always attracted more to a clone instead of the original because of the price difference. :)"\n\nBrother the reason for clone is people can have almost the same fun when shooting with a clone than with original one. i can safely bet that MOST of the people in Pakistan cannot describe the basics of target shooting let alone the intricacies of double tap, eye focus at a fixed length without looking at anything (empty space) or the trigger squeeze. They just want a proper gun which is dependable and will go bang always.. and has the backing of NORINCO. If you can recall the original 636 TT was selling at whooping 30k about 20 years ago.. check the price of gold at 5300 rs per tola, that time and if we calculate it then the same gun should be 370000 rupees.. getting the idea..\n\n12Gauge said: "guess what? have you ever seen or heard a clone user defending his choice? if possible kindly do so. you''ll find the arguments remarkably familiar. ;)"\n\nWell brother every one has a reason for his choice.. I made my choice because of two reasons.. metallic body and huge practice that was intended.. I have got the guns worth of practice from it and i have no doubts and am very very satisfied from it. I am NOT defending a CLONE, almost ALL the guns are clones of one gun.. and with some minute changes have evolved and developped into what they are now. CF 98 is an absolutely revolutionary and new design encased in PLASTICS.. and rattles very soon.. i just want to see it go through 17600 rounds as i have and see the condition of it and the user if he is alive. hehehe... i hope he doesn''t get a sunflower face as in cartoons.. hehehe...\n\nAnyways.. I just wanted to say one last thing.. NP22 rocks.. and at the price range it is a mighty good gun even though it may need some work on the insides.. but am sure that some fine tuning will make it nearly as good as to compete with any good quality gun..', ''),

(479347, ' [QUOTE=atiq;317475]12Gauge said: "you are absolutely right bro but I am afraid that you mistook my words as sarcasm which infact was nothing more than a light hearted humor. :yield:"\n\nIf it was light hearted then AANAY day yaara.... ;)\n\n12Gauge said: "Bro, putting an Original Sig Barrel in NP22 will not make it a SIG I am afraid. Its not just the barrel which makes a quality firearm. :)"\n\nBrother the quality firearm has three main things.. 1) barrel quality (i.e. insides) 2) Barrel to slide fitting/ slide to frame fitting and 3) the most importantly the sear and trigger group. There is a huge difference between SIG P226 and SigX6. Even though they are from the same manufacturer. However if you can fit in the barrel from SIG into the NP22 or HP77 then i am sure it would be a LOT better in condition than with Chinese barrel. If you have had some experience with polishing the sear or the trigger lever you would know the minute detail that goes in the quality. You are correct in the sense that it can never be compared to an original SIG but can you compare a 300000 rupees gun with 27000 rupees one??? This can never be a discussion it is waste of time for obvious reasons.. but when you are changing the barrel you are trying to make an average gun try to become as nearer to an original as possible. This will rejuvenate the life for couple of thousand rounds and a learning experience.\n\n12Gauge said: "Bro, here I would agree that NP22 is based on a SIG P-226 which definitely is a well tested design. however I am unable to understand why CF98 is an untested one? ;)"\n\nCF98 is a rotating barrel design, and has a small block that does the work. In most of the pistols it is an integrated block that does the same work but in CF98 it is done by a separate free floating block. The insides are very rough and the quality of the finish leaves almost everything to be wished for. Do something.. strip the pistol apart completely and take out each and every part and then reassemble it. THIS will show you the reality of what a well tested design means. Secondly the finish is what tells the quality of the gun.\n\n12Gauge said: "so the same rules/principles that apply to Chinese military in selecting a handgun do not apply in the case of US Navy Seals? are you under the assumption that it is only the practice of chinese military to adopt a handgun is based on political reasons? ;)"\n\nWell it was a reason why beretta was selected for US army for POLITICAL REASONS. however Navy Seals remained away being the elite. Chinese military has also special forces .. see which gun have they selected for their ELITE. comparing the gun of US elite with the gun of chinese infantryman.. seems odd to me.. even otherwise let me tell you something more. Selection of a weapon has got more things than can be written here. I can expound some.. such as Economy of providing 1.2 million pistols versus using a 10 times expensive pistol. You DO NOT go to war with a pistol rather it is just an item so that the infantry man can get to his rifle, i.e. ak-47. Nowadays the war is always at a farther range.. think Sniper.. and what will a SIG do when there is a sniper in front hiding??? SO the best option is have a gun which is excellent for short combat couple of times. However the navy seals use their pistols fitted with sound supressor very OFTEN and need a very refined design with very good accuracy.. think P210 design here.. THAT is why they have kept stuck to one design for so long.\n\n12Gauge said: "Bro, thats not a sign of quality or repute. clones almost always sell more than the original. why? because of the price difference. perspective customers are always attracted more to a clone instead of the original because of the price difference. :)"\n\nBrother the reason for clone is people can have almost the same fun when shooting with a clone than with original one. i can safely bet that MOST of the people in Pakistan cannot describe the basics of target shooting let alone the intricacies of double tap, eye focus at a fixed length without looking at anything (empty space) or the trigger squeeze. They just want a proper gun which is dependable and will go bang always.. and has the backing of NORINCO. If you can recall the original 636 TT was selling at whooping 30k about 20 years ago.. check the price of gold at 5300 rs per tola, that time and if we calculate it then the same gun should be 370000 rupees.. getting the idea..\n\n12Gauge said: "guess what? have you ever seen or heard a clone user defending his choice? if possible kindly do so. you''ll find the arguments remarkably familiar. ;)"\n\nWell brother every one has a reason for his choice.. I made my choice because of two reasons.. metallic body and huge practice that was intended.. I have got the guns worth of practice from it and i have no doubts and am very very satisfied from it. I am NOT defending a CLONE, almost ALL the guns are clones of one gun.. and with some minute changes have evolved and developped into what they are now. CF 98 is an absolutely revolutionary and new design encased in PLASTICS.. and rattles very soon.. i just want to see it go through 17600 rounds as i have and see the condition of it and the user if he is alive. hehehe... i hope he doesn''t get a sunflower face as in cartoons.. hehehe...\n\nAnyways.. I just wanted to say one last thing.. NP22 rocks.. and at the price range it is a mighty good gun even though it may need some work on the insides.. but am sure that some fine tuning will make it nearly as good as to compete with any good quality gun..[/QUOTE]\nAbsolutely remarkable,We always want to read u sir but u come here after a long long time,lastly ur posts about self defense were milestones and now u proved worth of Np22,A real gorgeous hand gun from China', ''),

(479350, ' @Siglock.. NP34 is a purpose gun for conceal carry and absolutely no match in the price range. It is a copy of P228 and was preferred by even the secret service.. till they switched to other calibers.. that made them change the weapon. navy seals still use it; i.e. those ppl who have larger guns such as snipers and gunners.\n\nWith NP34 use the rubber hogue grip and you will see the HUGE difference in shooting pleasure OR you can use the skate board tape on the sides of grip. The original grip is a plastic one with slippery surface.. Another solution is stick a 2000 or 2400 grit sand paper made in japan with some samad bond. TRY that. you can remove it any time you want.. believe me it makes hell alot of difference in the grip.\n\nThe way NP22 has performed has kept its design upto its fame and name. I absolutely love the gun, a true work horse.. My mistake was .. NOT taking the pics of the before and after pics of CF98 when i gave it the thorough battering at the Karsaz range and how it broke my heart literally; no doubt cf98 is an excellent gun for carry and rough handling in wet sweat, but my purpose is range and learning and carry.. NP22 needs some more care on external finish to keep it in tip top condition. cf98 is a bit forgiving in this manner. If you clean your gun properly and can peekaboo at the internals then NP 22 is far far better than any other gun.\n\nLet me share some thing.. I have a 20000 grit water stone for polishing katanas.. so i took apart NP22 and polished the internal parts using the AGI Video of SIG armorer course. and NOW i can take care of the pistol properly.. the trigger has NO creep and shoots absolutely like MAKKHAN.. however this is NOT recommended unless you really really know what you are doing.. it will ruin your pistol completely and will need a very expert gunsmith to bring it back in working condition.', ''),

Always ensure that the weapon with its pommel aimed upwards and point downwards stay''s tightly next to your body so as not to catch a by stander by accident. your grip must be strong yet flexible to allow swift deployment of the weapon.\n\n3.Before you start trying these move''s you have to make sure that you are fit enough to handle the weight and trajectory of the weapon....trust me this is the hardest part you not only have to be strong enough to launch an effective thrust but also pull out of it while maintaining a tenable defense. This fitness and strenght can only be achieved by maintaining a healthy life style like working out and doing lots of push ups and pull ups as that''s the most effective way of maintaing balanced muscle tone and coordination.\n\n4.During drill''s and sparring with a partner make sure you dont aim for the upper levels of the body like the neck and head and always wear protective gear...if thats not avilable[it is but it''s kind of hard to obtain and quite pricey and that too for boken and other wooden stuff]....use a wooden sword for practice and drill''s...the weight of the drill sword is important as it will help prepare you for weilding the real thing.\n\nIn short please dont do anything stupid.........please....will start posting images from tomorrow.', ''),

I have not included CZ 75 SP01 in the list due to practicality. It is good for range but for daily carry, I don''t consider it practical. And I have rated CZs and Caracals at same level in first 2 ratings as in my opinion, they are at par. The only difference is personal prefrence. If you don''t have any issue with polymer and striker fired pistols, go for Caracal. If you need hammer fired pistol, go for any CZ. As a matter of fact, I consider Berettas (92FS, M9 & 90 Two), Glock, CZs (75B, P01 and Duty) and now Caracal in same range. Anything above them are HK (USP and P30) and then Sigsaur (226 or 228).

I just love .45acp. I think Taurus 1911 is a better option then 97b/bd. Reason is. Though the Cz''s are more better built and reliable then taurus, Pt1911 has proven itself here time and time again. Cz97b/bd has higher mag capacity, but when you think of .45acp, 1911s pop up in your mind. 1911s are the best platform in .45Acp. Pt1911 is lighter, has a longer barrel(.5 inch), thinner frame, so its more easily concealable. Plus its a 1911, its a must have for every gun enthusiast. 1911s have more aftermarket accessories in the markets, therefore are more customized. That''s my opinion, rest is up to you.', ''),

If you need a rod for lure fishing, you will have to look around as they are not readily available. Abdullah Fishing Center, located in basement just next to Saver Foods ahead of China Market area, has good collection of bait fishing and has few lure fishing rods as well. If you are looking for a fly fishing rod than it would be difficult to find one here. I get mine from USA or Malaysia. More importantly, the shop owner Mr Khalid Usmani is a keen angler himself and a very nice and upright person. Without doubt, he is the cheapest in Rawalpindi. The same stuff you would get in almost double the price elsewhere. Please go to him and he will give you the right things. \n\nGown House has few imported rods collection which are basically all marine fishing rods and not required for freshwater fishing. The prices are phenomenally high. The owner knows nothing about fishing and tries to impress the buyer with big brand names, without knowing the purpose of that equipment. \n\nGood luck.[/QUOTE]\n\n@ gilani ,  brother i want a fishing rod for masheer fishing ie fresh water fishing , plz suggest me good rod (not priced much) for this purpose. i am from balochistan. i use to fish in fresh water with just hook and string. now i want to improve my fishing , u r requested to guide me regarding buying of some cheap but good fishing equipment according to my fishing type.   also tell what is the breeding season for fresh water fish? thanks\n                                                                                               regards,....', ''),

All, nothing to do with it''s functionality, but handling limitations due to it''s compact size.\n\nElse, it''s a fine budget option and most suitable for carrying in and out of your car.\n\nJust be careful to get a new and fresh one.

(480225, 'Need information about this gun Dear all,\nMy friend is having this gun honestly i never saw this type of model before. Sorry i have currently one picture to show you but promise in coming days i would show you more. We are confused about the gun made. There is no writting on the gun that either it is made of russia or else. But in our experience it is more russian. If we look the engraving style, durability, meterial used, screw type used etc very much resembeling to USSR IJ 27 E. But in mechanism wise and structure wise it is quite different. The description of this gun is that it is light gun 3.1 Kg (12 G- O/U). Open space between the barrels and connected with 2 cluches. Upper barrel is clynder and the lower barrel is choke. Forehand in two pieces, one remain with barrels if you open the gun or remove the forehand. Woodstock is very smart and the recoil paid has star on it with flower engraving at end. The finishing wise and barrel internal part is very very much neat, clear and durable, still shining as like scracthless glass. There is also 1961 written on the gun. There is always need to lock the safty as safety is not autolock.\n\nThis is little discription, and please see the picture and share your opinion and knowledge about this gun if you seen this before.\n\nThanks\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14476[/ATTACH]', ''),

(480335, 'Stippling... Got guts?  Anyone? Salam All,\nGrip texture for traction has been a real issue with many firearms being manufactured today whether they be Metal, Aluminum, or Polymer.  Grip is key for proper shooting.  As there are many shooting charts showing things like if shooting in the top left quadrant = gripping too hard and so forth.  Well, what if one is sitting in this wonderful country like ours or something like it; in other words a temperate climate where sweating and sweaty palms is mostly the norm?  Naturally one is going to grab their gun hard so the grip angle doesn''t change while firing and in doing so do just that... start missing.  There are those who are against any grip traction enhancements.  I have personally seen people at the range re-adjusting their grip after EVERY shot.  Pay attention next time when you are at the range as you might be one of them.  As you get into speed shooting or even target shooting - this is a NO NO.  \nOver the years as technology progressed - so did the techniques to enhance grip traction.  There are many doodads or gizmos out there that have shown up at one time or another... things like grip glue, powder, and sand to name a few.   However two variations have remained constant as far as grip traction control methods go.  \nOne variant applies to all firearm grips whether they be wood, metal, aluminum, or polymer; sticky sandpaper or lately some people are applying glues mixed with silicon carbide.  Both provide extreme grip traction texture; however, all of them WILL start to fade or chip or get used up over time as solvents and chemicals and regular use wears them out.  The Sand Paper texture is most popular because its cheap, you can use skateboard tape or the best is anti slip by 3M also available in rubberized finish.  The glue method is using Marine Tex glue with Silicon Carbide grit mix with glue being applied first followed by a sprinkle of the SC material.\nSecond variation is PERMANENT and if done right is very effective and good looking.  In metal or aluminum frame guns people pay premiums even today for CHECKERING.  More fine the better and more it costs 20LPI, 25LPI, 30LPI, or more; as the Line Per Inch increase so does the price to have things checkered as more precision is involved.  In the case of 1911 pistols, a custom high priced pistol is appreciated ALWAYS with precision checkering in many areas like the front strap, back strap, front of trigger guard, and rear of slide.  Some pay a lot more to have cnc checkering done on slide rather than the cocking serrations.  These provide extreme grip hence requiring one to just hold the gun and NOT squeeze it.  Stippling is another method to provide traction BUT looks very nasty when done on metal or aluminum frames.  When we move to polymer its however a whole new ball game.  Polymer during manufacture from moulds and mixing does involve various oils.  On top of that when the users'' hands are sweaty or oily (and they usually are as noone washes their hands and guns with soap before a shooting session) the grip of the gun is always re-adjusting itself as one progresses with fire repetition.  What can one do?  Well you can always once a week dip your polymer frame in luke warm water with liquid dishwashing soap for an hour to remove the oils from frames... having done that enough will dry up the frame and crack it (not recommended).  One can apply adhesive with silicon carbide or those 3m traction tape which will peel off after a while (been doing this sticker thing now for 8 years).  Or my favorite is when people put the finger groove rubber grips on the grip area (nice item, gives one hernia trying to put it on, looks great; however, upon heating to put it on you can see how soft and movable it becomes; hence it too wobbles around in the hand on a hot day).  If one does nothing then over the period of time polymer gets shinier and shinier meaning polished and more and more slippery.  So what is left?  I have been hearing for some time now about the benefits of stippling.  How it makes the grip texture very good and so forth.  \nNow we come to my side of the woods.  I am a gun lover but also a shooter.  I don''t like any gun I can''t shoot.  I am NOT a coffee table show-offer matter of fact I love to make fun of people like that... in their presence.  If I have a gun I really don''t care what I paid for it - I believe in what i can do with it.  I have owned guns worth over 8 lacs which I have turned around and sold immediately due to the fact that I couldn''t shoot with it.  \nIn the case of Glocks I have always owned one since 1986.  I started shooting Glock 17L (ported) in IPSC matches in ''86.  From there I jumped to the Glock 19 when it was introduced in late 1986.  I had five Glocks back then two G17L (ported), one G17L (unported), two G19s.  Each had had work done on them uniquely.  One was painted, one had a trigger job and so forth.  Later in the begining of the ''90s, I bought a G21 and later a 10mm version as well.  This is one gun I have always owned.  This and a 1911.  Others have come and gone.  These are always around me.  Over the past few years I sold six of the Glocks I owned and decided to make one Glock; but this Glock would have to be something that tops everything.  Its got to have all the mods.  I started my quest with triggers, going from one to the next until I finally got it right.  I then moved on to the recoil system till I came upon a dual shock spring system worth getting.  This was followed by a custom slide and barrels.  I opted for LWD threaded and G34 OEM barrels.  I then moved on to the compensators tried many ended up with a final one. The thing which caused me the most pain was the sights.  After many many purchases I found only two to be the best from the rest: Richard Heinie and Warren Tactical.  So after all the hooplas I was back to square one again... grip traction!  I had been buying 3m from the US but in this hot weather climate was changing them quite often due to heat and cleaning chemicals damaging them.  Been meaning to try stippling... woahh!!  What if I ruin the gun?  Glocks are EXPENSIVE here.  What if I don''t do this stippling thing?  I will always wonder... What if?  What the heck, spent a couple of hours and did a frame I had laying around.  \nWhat you see is MORE than what I expected!  How was the grip traction?   [SIZE=5]AMAZING, AWESOME and whatever else... lolz.  [SIZE=3]Why didn''t I do this before?  What in the hell was I waiting for?  I should''ve done this stippling thing years ago.  There is sooo much traction I barely have to touch my gun and it feels like the grip wants to stay stuck to my hand.  I can''t wait to try it out at the range.  For now what I did do was put soap on my hands and then grabbed the gun... guess what people?  It does NOT slip... lolz.  I aaaam loving it.  BIG TIME.  Here are the pictures.  Will be updating with more as time progresses.\n[/SIZE][/SIZE][IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-8.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/Glock34Custom-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/Glock34Custom.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/StippleRight.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/StippleBack.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/StippleFront.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/StippleSideL.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(480357, 'Unboxing the Hatsan 125 Sniper Finally, I got the Sniper. Excited to hold it in my hands, first thing noted was the weight, it was more than my Diana 35 but manageable. Checked the barrel, seemed clean enough. Fired first shot, It was powerful with lot of recoil and vibration, but very quite. What you hear is only the twangy noise of the spring, very quite. Then fired about 30 pellets some on a distant target about 150 yards away, and the hit was instant, I could hear the noise of pallet hitting the target even at that distance. It definitely hits with a magnum force.[ATTACH=CONFIG]14490[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14491[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14492[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14493[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14494[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14495[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14496[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14497[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14498[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14499[/ATTACH]\n\nRegarding outlook, the finish is OK, not of RWS Diana quality, Blueing is fine but could be better. I did not like the hollow feeling of the stock, otherwise it is beautiful and well built.\nModerator is surely effective. The trigger has a hard second stage, after about 80 pellets and some adjustment it is slightly better. I hope it will get better with passage of time, I am afraid of doing experiments on it for adjustment. So far there is no issue of safety, trigger jam, every thing is working as it should.\nNow comes accuracy.\nInitially firing cycle was much harsh, and I was not getting any groups. Checked the spring, there was some grease on it, but minimal, I poured 4 drops of gun oil on the spring to make it a bit moist, fired some pellets, no improvement. Checked barrel again, on vry careful inspection there seemed some darkish tiny spots 2-3 inches near the muzzle end. I cleaned the barrel ( very carefully, so nothing gets caught up in the baffles of moderator) first with oiled patch and then with clean soft cloth patches. first patch came out very dirty and black, means barrel was surely not clean. I cleaned it till the patches came out completely clean. Checked the barrel again, these spots were gone and barrel was very shiny and real clean this time. \nUsing same gamo promag again made some 10 yard shots and was surprised, it was hitting same spot again and again, one hole groups at 10 yards. Tried different pellets H&n wade cutters ( flat head Pellets) because these were the most accurate I shot previously with Diana. Sighted the gun accuracy did improved a lot,and I hope it will get better with time as I get used to the magnum recoil and the gun breaks in.\nI have got AO scope with it which I plan to mount after about 1000 shots at least.\nAnd there was an extra scope stop in the box (well, I think it is a scope stop- check the pic). I think it can be used for front mount, the rear scope stop already installed on the gun also seems sturdy enough to me although according to some comments it does break away some times.\nI will fire more shots on longer distance targets soon and will update about the results. Hope this gun will last, I have liked its low noise , power and looks. surely a keeper.\nAny comments, ideas and suggestions to improve the accuracy are most welcome. Lets see how it performs in future.', ''),

(480384, ' GREAT DEAL my friend!! I see you got the AO scope, i got the 3-9x44e scope so your deal is much better :) (i''m a lil jealous hahaha). Now 1st of all congratz on taking the plunge and getting your hands on this beast, you wont be disappointed I assure you :) following is what I''d highly recommend:\n- 1st off I''d recommend cleaning the barrel but you already did that.\n\n- Get a can of Brunox gun oil for [B]external[/B] cleaning (twice a month is sufficient) spray it on a clean piece of cotton and clean the gun. Your bluing will come out richer and after a couple of cleaning sessions the stock and bluing will be even toned.\n\n- I''d suggest you do not use the H&N wadcutters as these are slightly lighter and will give you approx 975-980 fps therefore may not be very accurate above 20 yards.\n\n- Do not scope the gun yet, you''ll be delighted to notice how well it shoots without scope out of the box. You may not even need to adjust the fiber optic sights. Scope it after 250-300 shots; don''t go through the agony of firing 1000 shots, hence resisting the urge to scope it:p. By then i.e after 250-300 shots you''ll be well acquainted with the gun and its shot cycle will also have improved.\n\n- Do not attempt to play with the trigger adjustments just yet. Wait for 200-300 shots. You''ll be surprised at how crisp this trigger can break. Go through the manual and Hatsan USA website before adjusting the trigger.\n\n- During break in period practice artillery hold, that is the key to squeezing maximum accuracy out of this beast. I hold it as lightly as possible and allow it to recoil as much as it can.\n\n- The extra scope stop can be installed just behind the 1st ring. You can refer to the initial images I posted in "hatsan 125" thread. Do that and you''ll have a solid scope setup.\n\nThat''s all I can think of right now :p enjoy this hard hitting piece of work and remember to shoot safe :) Good Luck', ''),

(480395, 'Noor and Co. Lucky star Karachi area review X Noor and Co.(formarly Zia and co) Lucky Star area review X\n\nAs a rule I tend to group multiple reviews in one survey.  But I feel that this particular dealer merited his very own review.\n\nThis is a brand new dealer who has just opened his outlet right next to Karachi arms centre at main Lucky Star. (Near the camel milk seller)\n\nMe and fellow member Zainulabideen decided to review him and accordinly walked into his outlet and asked to see some 9mm handguns. \n\nHere. I would like Zain bhai to please update this review in case I have missed anything.\n\nThe salesman showed me a Taurus PT 92 in black with rail. Nice gun very nice indeed.  Asking 45k. he had obligingly attached a laser as well.  Now 45k for a PT 92 is a very good deal indeed. Too good in fact. So I asked him the inevitable &#8220;is it local&#8221; question. \n\nHe replied to the effect that the parts are original Brazilian. I was a bit taken aback. How exactly did he get parts here? &#8220;Oh, from Afghanistan.&#8221;\nPersonaly I never knew the Brazilians exported Taurus parts to Afghanistan for reasons best known to them.\n\nMe: Err this looks remarkably like the products sold at the nearby Royal arms co factory outlet\nHim: Oh  no those cheap guns are manufactured in Pakistan&#8230; Proberly Peshawar\nMe: And this gun?\nHim: The parts are made in Afghanistan Sir.\n\nMe:Umm Ok enough of that now show me some shotguns\n\nHe showed me a Vepr 12 clone hybrid with a ak 47 type down wards folding skeleton stock and plastic drum magazine equipped with a laser. Nice.  I mean really nice lookin weapon. Asking 45k \n\nHim: The weapon too was assembled with parts made in Afghanistan.&#8221; Actualy( He told me in a confidential whisper)  it was an Afghan tank. \nMe: It was a what?? :O\nHim::A tank. U know a lot em were scrapped and U know sir. tank metal is very very solid so &#8220;They&#8221; made shotguns out of em.\n\nI remember reading on the backs of rickshaws. &#8220;main bara ho kay pajero Banoun gaa&#8221; (When I grow up I wil become a Pajero SUV) But a tank that grew up to become a "shotgun&#8221;&#8230;.. If tanks have souls the poor thing must be in purgatory!\n\nMe: (Under my breath) it must have been a really naughty tank indeed.. \nHim: eh? What?\n\nMe: I mean it came back as a shotgun.. Must have done some really mean things in its previous life as a tank to deserve being re-incarnated as a shotgun.\n\nBut I coud see it was lost on him&#8230; \n\nThen I saw an Akdal M 1919. At least it looked like an Akdal M 1919. Very realistic looking weapon. But for the fact that someone had forgotten to put in a peep hole in the rear sight!! \n\nI loved the magazines though. 7 round capacity At around 3.5K a piece if they fit the original m1919 and work well they should be a real bargain. Looked pretty well made too. \nMe: how much is it for\nHim: (The by now ubiquitous) 45k \nMe: Turkish? \nHim: Oh no. Turks don&#8217;t know the ABCs of making guns. This is made\nMe: with afghan tank parts.. yes yes I know. But where. I mean is it made in Afghanistan or Peshawar or Darra? \nHim: Its made at the border.. The afghans send over the parts and there are factories at the border that turn em into guns.. \n\nI took a deep breath and tried to force the image of afghans ruthlessly assaulting and plundering  poor, helpless tanks and after dismembering em.. making bundles of their parts and surreptitiously throwing em over the border where those parts were caught and turned to guns right across the border&#8230;\n\nMe:So this akdal and Vepr clone. Can they fire slugs. \nHim: Oh u can fire a thousand of em if u want. The guns can handle it. .. \nMe:  A local offering that can actually handle slugs???\nHim: Oh we guarantee it&#8230; \n\nI guess it could. After all it was a Tank masquerading as a shotgun.\n\nOK whats that? I asked looking at a big M4 type of assault weapon. \nHim: That&#8217;s an M4 in .30 calibre complete with red dot and laser aiming module asking 85k without accessories. And 2 25 round mags included.\nDamn that thing looked good!\n\nZain bhai took a look\nZain bhai: its on a PB license right?\nHim: No not at all its NPB since it&#8217;s a pistol.\nZain bhai:That thing? A Pistol?? does that mean that the barrel is in fact a shotgun like appendage without threading.\nHim: oh no sir its threaded through out just like a real M 4\nZain bhai: And it&#8217;s a pistol?\nHim: yes of course the MOI has given instructions that ALL pistol calibers are in fact pistols irrespective of barrel size.\n\nNow that thing was waay bigger than the MP 5 which in our humble opinion is definitely PB irrespective of whether its semi or full auto. Due to the length of its barrel.  Now this thing was much much bigger then an MP 5.. Yet it was NPB..  And made right across the border from parts scavenged from those unfortunate tanks. \nAnd 85k at that.. Tank or no tank this is the most expensive (un branded).30 I have ever seen here in Karachi..\nZain Bhai: Are u sure its legel?\nHim: If it were not legal sir how would we be selling it? \nCant really argue with the man&#8217;s logic now can U?\n\nBy this time Zain bhai had enough.. He got up and decided to wait outside. As for me. .. the best was yet to come..\nI said that I wanted something cheaper. So he showed me something cheaper.  \nA &#8220;Zafar&#8221; berretta 92 clone.  Now Zafar Alam has a reputation for making some of the best copies of the berretta here in Pakistan. In fact he was amongst the pioneers of berretta copy makers here.\nHim: No not Zafar alam. But Zafar. \nMe: But isn&#8217;t Zafar Alam a gunsmith? (I had no idea that Zafar alam was something like a rock group that split apart with both Zafar and Alam making their own brands&#8230;.)\nHim: No No this is another Zafar that makes guns as good as Zafar Alam\n\nHe was in effect trying to sell me a copy of a copy and made by someone who had even copied the actual copier&#8217;s name!! 30k  final price\nAn &#8216;original&#8217; copy (even though the term&#8217;s an oxymoron) made by Zafar Alam goes for around 25k or so.  I tried out his copy\\s copy and the decocker jammed on me at the first attempt.  Now that&#8217;s a problem that I have never encountered in a betty clone. After the TT the local gunsmiths have perfected this design. And such faults may be common in their Zegana copies but never their berretas. \nBesides that, the firing pin looked pretty badly made. Kind of like an over sized darning needle that had been broken off in the middle. \nI asked him for an SS finish. Now this one was waay nicer.. A real firing pin and very light. Much much lighter than any other betty clone I have seen in the market. On top of that.  The control lever was smoother and silkier then Ashweriya rai&#8217;s ebony tresses ..  A worthy copy&#8217;s copy. Final 32k \nHowever I have seen the same quality (if not better) with NFAC and GHA products. (Both betty copy makers of some repute)\nI asked for something stil cheaper and he showed me a Himalya arms co&#8217;s local 9mm wanna be zegana clone.  18k..  I have seen the same weapon at HM Traders a few yards down the road. Asking 13k Negotiable. \n\nBy this time Zain bhai had started calling me outside.. So I decided to call it a day. But not before I took the price of Chinese red box ammo. He was retailing at Rs. 35 a pop.. Irrespective of weather u bought 1 box or a crate.  He was also willing to make a 144 permit for 6 months for Rs. 4k', ''),

He agreed to get me one but the time line he has put is 6 to 7 months as he declared the total quota for the license he has is 50.\nNow what does quota mean here i have no idea, and asking him detail about it was going to piss him off hence i backed off.\nIn the end he gave me a list of documents to be attached with the form\nthe list comes as\nCopies of Electric and gas bills.\nCopies of ID card\nCopy of letter from the office which should state your employment status and should mention your NTN number\nPlus a couple of my pics.\nSo the letter from office was easy , as i am the project manager and my friend is in HR. So i have that, the electric and gas bill will be given to me by my mother.\nID card is fortunately I have.\nSO i am planning to submit it on Wednesday\n\nED  : Bhaiya did you get the information you mentioned earlier ?[/QUOTE]\n\nAs of now, Home dep lics have been suspended pending furhter notification. ALL DCs of every district here have a quota of 50 lics per month.. And demand of a few thousand.. also per month. What he was saying was that he might be able to accommodate u in the quota 6 months hence. That may or may not be possible depending on the number of applications he has at the time..

Effective January 1, 2013, a Restroom Trip Policy will be established to provide a more consistent method of accounting for each employee''s restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of employees.\r\n\r\nUnder the policy, a "Restroom Trip Bank" will be established for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will be given a Restroom Trip credit of twenty (20) trips.  Restroom Trip credits can be accumulated from month to month.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks, the entrances to all restrooms will be equipped with personnel identification stations and computer linked voice print recognition devices. Before the end of December, each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one under stress) to the Material Department. The voice print recognition stations will\r\nbe operational but not restrictive for the month of January. Employees should acquaint themselves with the station during that period.\r\n\r\nIf the employee''s Restroom Bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restroom will not unlock for that employee''s voice until the first of the next month. In addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper toll retractors.  If the stall is occupied for more than three (3) minutes, an alarm will sound.  Thirty (30) seconds after the alarm sounds the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. If the stall\r\nremains occupied, your picture will be taken.\r\n\r\nThe picture will then be posted on the Distribution Center Bulletin Boards. Anyone''s picture showing up three (3) times will be immediately terminated.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this policy, please ask your immediate supervisor.

They made it to the medal table because millions of rupees have been invested in providing them various facilities,&#8221; he said here on Friday on his return from London.\n&#8220;If only 10 per cent of the hockey budget is allocated for the shooters, they will produce better results at least at the Asian level in the next four years,&#8221; remarked Khurram, who finished 28th in the field of 36 shooters at the Royal Barracks Range in London with score of 112/125.\n&#8220;I am not satisfied with my performance. But keep it in mind that I have achieved it without any help from any foreign coach.\nThis is a sport of precision and without scientific training and coaching, it is very difficult to make any progress,&#8221; he\ncommented.\n&#8220;Whatever I have achieved reflects my personal efforts and support of my coach Razi Ahmed Khan. But without foreign coach you cannot achieve international standard,&#8221; said the marksman.\nKhurram said that he was ranked below 100 in the International Sports Shooting Federation (ISSF) ranking, but achieved better results than some of the top-ranked marksmen.\n&#8220;I cannot devote full time to the sports, since I am not a professional shooter,&#8221; said Khurram, who made South Asian record with a score of 123/125 in 2002, adding that skeet medal winners in the London Olympics are all top professionals.\nThe marksman said the country can do better in the Asian Games and other continental events through long-term planning and availability of adequate funds to the National Rifle Association of Pakistan (NRAP). &#8212;APP\n\n\n Saw this newspaper clipping yesterday.After attending 3-olympics, this is what our star shooter has to say.', ''),

(I have subsequently reacquired it) The current card MOIs are totally unrecommended IMHO. One cannot change the weapon on them and the sindh high court has issued a judgement against them. More ever there is no set procedure for renewing them.\r\n\r\nThey might be re-converted to the books from which they were forcibly converted to cards. However if that''s what you want then the current rate is 27k and a wait of  4-6 weeks for the demand note. Once you get the demand note u purchase the weapon and get it entered at the DC office. After which it will be taken to NADRA where they will verify it and issue u a card within 30-90 days. \r\n\r\n Status: Open\r\n\r\nDealers making em: Saddar Armoury (Lucky Star)  and Guns and Ammo (Zamzama)\r\n\r\n[b]HD computerised ones:[/b]\r\n\r\nThey are issued by the Home department and the applicant has to personally visit the department where they take pictures and thumb scans and make a license exactly like the passport.

I used a Soldering iron for the job.  The choice of tip is up to the user; I preferred small.  One must remember to NOT push against the plastic otherwise the soldering iron will go through the frame ruining it.  The tip Must be cleaned every five pokes with a water wet scotchbrite spounge pad.  Just touching and causing a pin prick type hole and then moving on to make the next hole and giving it just enough gapping to where the outer edges of each individual hole overlap.  Its very tedious as the iron must be held exactly perpendicular to the frame to try to give it a straight hole.  Its a very tedious and time consuming task which requires total concentration.  As far as having the guts bit bhai, I am sure many here would have taken this gamble had the gun only cost them 700/usd.

And interestingly , he was citing a (non existent) circular of interior ministry permitting above action. Initially , i was of the opinion that such thing is having a false/cosmetic shroud which if removed,shall bring the  barrel to its legal and original  length of 5-6 inches to put that thing under the legal ambit of a pistol and if you remember ED, i literally tried to remove it by twisting the barrel but i was shocked when the salesman told me that there is no shroud and all that length is the barrel itself having grooves up to muzzle.

Effective January 1, 2013, a Restroom Trip Policy will be established to provide a more consistent method of accounting for each employee''s restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of employees.\r\n\r\nUnder the policy, a "Restroom Trip Bank" will be established for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will be given a Restroom Trip credit of twenty (20) trips.  Restroom Trip credits can be accumulated from month to month.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks, the entrances to all restrooms will be equipped with personnel identification stations and computer linked voice print recognition devices. Before the end of December, each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one under stress) to the Material Department. The voice print recognition stations will\r\nbe operational but not restrictive for the month of January. Employees should acquaint themselves with the station during that period.\r\n\r\nIf the employee''s Restroom Bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restroom will not unlock for that employee''s voice until the first of the next month. In addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper toll retractors.  If the stall is occupied for more than three (3) minutes, an alarm will sound.  Thirty (30) seconds after the alarm sounds the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. If the stall\r\nremains occupied, your picture will be taken.\r\n\r\nThe picture will then be posted on the Distribution Center Bulletin Boards. Anyone''s picture showing up three (3) times will be immediately terminated.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this policy, please ask your immediate supervisor. They have all received advance instruction.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a nice day,\r\n\r\nThe Boss[/QUOTE]', ''),

It was my 24/7 Carry buddy from the day I got there till the day I left and took it everywhere with me. What I wanted to ask all those who own a Stoger Couger is that the back of both Magazines that came with the gun developed some nasty deep scratches during insertion and detachment. There were scratches on both Magz from they were put in and out of the gun, Which kinda made me doubt the originality of the Magz. I even asked a friend of me who is a dealer (fire arm shop owner) in both local and forign guns and he said it was normal but I am not convinced. So I would like to ask the SC Owners in here if you guys have noticed the same thing? Any nasty or deep scratches on the back of your SC''s Magazines?

(481142, ' Latest update on MOI license:\n\nAs per information i could gather so far through some reliable sources at NARDA, given below are a few details. \n\n1. MOI old book Re-validation project at NADRA has been closed. This was a separate project by NADRA and even the staff deployed for this project has been shifted to other business units. This step is taken in respect to Sindh Highcourt order and controversy created because of it. Onwards, all old MOI books are valid for normal use as in past. The cards that have been issued (re-validated ones) are also good to use and will be treated under the SOP for new cards. However, those cases which were in the process are held back as NADRA have to decide a way out on how to return the fees deposited against these requests. Actually this is the conflict/hot issue on how to deal with these cases. As per Sindh court orders, they cannot revalidate old licenses any more. So if NADRA has to return pending cases, they also will return the money. AND ON THIS, there is no way out yet. \n\n2. New requests/license is a total different project and will continue on as per previous procedure. MOI will not issue booklet licenses again. However, as I stated above, due to controversies and some confusions on Sindh Highcourt latest decision, the process for new licenses is also halted till further notice. There is NO BAN from MOI so far but NADRA has stopped the process by its own choice(main reason told is un-clarity).\n\n3. Due to NADAR&#8217;s decision on halting all type of arms licenses, ICT (Islamabad Capital Territory) license process is also effected. ICT license is NPB and issued for federal capital region and Punjab. As it also involves one verification from NADRA, this process is effected too. \n\nI just got this info about two days back so thought to share it with PG members. I am not claiming this is 100% accurate but this is best to my knowledge as updated by very reliable sources in NADRA. Thank you!', ''),

(481168, '''Breaking in'' periods: Your views Do you believe in a "break in period" for a new gun?\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of Propositions:\r\n \r\n[b]1. The “Barrels” of rifles need to be broken in, with the end result of increased accuracy or decreased accuracy if not done or done improperly.[/b]\r\n\r\nRegarding this Gale McMillan was pretty vocal in the past about how barrel break-in is basically a way for barrel makers to get you to wear your barrel out faster, and thus need to buy a new barrel. \r\n[quote] I feel that the first shot out of a barrel is its best and every one after that deteriorates [the bore] until the barrel is gone. If someone can explain what physically takes place during break-in to modify the barrel then I may change my mind. As the physical properties of a barrel don''t change because of the break-in procedures it means it''s all hog wash. I am open to any suggestions that can be documented otherwise if it is just someone''s opinion--forget it. [/quote]\r\nGale McMillan, of McMillan Stocks fame, was one of the finest barrel-makers and benchrest shooters of all time.\r\nMore info found here [url]http://www.6mmbr.com/gailmcmbreakin.html[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]2. The New gun needs to be “broken in”; you should expect failures to function during the first 500ish rounds.[/b]  \r\n\r\nWhat exactly does this mean? I have yet to find a new pistol that isn''t great out of the box magically smooth itself out after 500 rounds. (Problematic Pistols remain problematic until they are repaired/fixed/get parts replaced.)\r\nOr does this mean a period where the shooter gets more comfortable with the pistol, experiments with ammo, etc.? \r\n\r\nThere are two Schools of thoughts here: \r\na)One group Believes if it fails to Function out of the box, It’s a crappy gun, associated with poor manufacturing or cutting corners. \r\nb)Another Believes all gun have break in periods. \r\n\r\n[u]In my opinion, I expect a new gun to Work (perform its primary function: feed, fire and eject a round) provided it’s been cleaned and lubed.[/u]\r\nI also understand that even with Modern precision machine manufacturing techniques once every now and then a lemon may come your way. No amount of Breaking in can fix what is actually broken in a firearm.\r\nRegarding "Smoothing Out", I believe that subjective assessment is 80-90 percent the user getting USED TO the new firearm, and some degree of springs loosening up and adjusting. Both of which don’t improve the functionality, or performance by any scientific measure.\r\nAlso the firearms I own don’t mention the need to break in by firing ‘x’ amounts of rounds in the user manual. I would not own a pistol that requires a "break in period" anyway. This means the firearm wasn''t properly finished and if they can''t get the slide rails, feed ramp, or whatever other surfaces finished properly in manufacturing, where else did they skimp?\r\nWhat is the opinion of forum members in this regard?', ''),

Had a fantasic time and through out my trip I was accompanied by my best friend, My new Stoeger Couger 8000 that I got purchase for me before I got there. It was my 24/7 Carry buddy from the day I got there till the day I left and took it everywhere with me. What I wanted to ask all those who own a Stoger Couger is that the back of both Magazines that came with the gun developed some nasty deep scratches during insertion and detachment. There were scratches on both Magz from they were put in and out of the gun, Which kinda made me doubt the originality of the Magz. I even asked a friend of me who is a dealer (fire arm shop owner) in both local and forign guns and he said it was normal but I am not convinced. So I would like to ask the SC Owners in here if you guys have noticed the same thing? Any nasty or deep scratches on the back of your SC''s Magazines? I dint take any pictures of the Magz that shows the scratches but took afew dull/ bad quality snaps of the gun itself using my blackberry and would like to apologise for the bad or poor quality of the pics in advance.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14536[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14538[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14539[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]14540[/ATTACH][/QUOTE\n\nANOTHER QUESTION I was going to ask the SC Gurus along with the first question but forgot to ask is the dots on the sights, Are they supposed to glow in the dark or not?

(481310, ' From an educational point of View, What does "breaking in" mean?\nIt seems for most of us, it simply means [b]"Smoothing out"[/b] of the [b]"Feel"[/b] of the gun.\n@Bird shooter regarding Airguns, in my experience, My very first group of shots is always bigger than my last group of shots on any given day , Similarly when I fire shots at the range with a handgun, My First string of shots , is generally a larger group than the last string.\nI would say that is mostly the Shooter "warming up" in both cases.\nIn may sports you will see players warming up(including shooting), the very first ball bowled during a match being a wide ball (for example)  \nI hv yet to see any improved accuracy or shrinking of group sizes on part of the airgun/handgun. However I hv improved as a shooter over the said period of time. Are tighter groups two years down the road with my trusty airgun/handgun due to improved skill on part of the shooter, or the "Break in" process?   \nLike I said , from an objective stand point, the handgun/airgun is still more accurate than I am as a shooter.    \n\n[QUOTE=Faisji;319398]The break in is necessary so the metal on metal friction is smoothed out and it becomes reliable.More tighter the fit on a gun surfaces the longer it will take to smooth out hence the longer the break-in.[/quote]\nSir , ty for your input.\nI missed your thread. Regarding the metal on metal friction, isn''t lubing supposed to reduce friction and limit wear of metal parts.\n\n[QUOTE=Faisji;319398]Also extension of you argument all new car and motorbikes are badly made because they require a break-in period.[/QUOTE]\nSir Engine "break in" is a myth as far as modern cars go , according to my knowledge. More on that later, however lets say Engine "break in" is something all car manufactures recommend, Now, when you''re breaking your car in, do you expect it to stumble and stall at intersections? Then why would you expect your gun to fail to feed?\n\nThe Smoothing out of various function levers in a handgun is understandable, but still inconsequential to the functioning of a gun. The problem with the "Break in period" definition I hv is when people suggest its acceptable to hv failures in primary function of firearms ( feed, fire and eject).\nIN my opinion, that is giving manufacturers a free pass to cut corners and deliver an unfinished product and expect the user to spend upwards of 40k worth of ammunition, just to make the gun reliable(if that is even possible).\n\nTake the example of the Zastava pistol ( which is the benchmark of reliability in Pak) or the Glock ( benchmark internationally).\nThe Zastava is a crude handgun, with tooling/machining marks/irregularities on internal parts (and externally), however it will Chew up and spit out any JHP rounds straight outa the box, till the day the hands of the user develop arthritis. \nCan a CF-98 be smoothed out to feed armscor JHP reliably ?\n\nThe Firearm that most associate with this break in period is the 1911, a hundred year old design. In a huge number of cases people send their 1911''s back to the manufacturer (internationally, where they can). Now if the manufacturers were to simply run a few hundred rounds through them and send them back then I would agree there is something as "Break in" improved reliability, however that is not the case, almost all of those 1911''s hv part replacements or some gunsmithing done to them. That to me is the definition of a repaired firearm.\nRegards.', ''),

It was my 24/7 Carry buddy from the day I got there till the day I left and took it everywhere with me. What I wanted to ask all those who own a Stoger Couger is that the back of both Magazines that came with the gun developed some nasty deep scratches during insertion and detachment. There were scratches on both Magz from they were put in and out of the gun, Which kinda made me doubt the originality of the Magz. I even asked a friend of me who is a dealer (fire arm shop owner) in both local and forign guns and he said it was normal but I am not convinced. So I would like to ask the SC Owners in here if you guys have noticed the same thing? Any nasty or deep scratches on the back of your SC''s Magazines?

The type of a gun that you want - [I]or seem to be approving of [/I]- are available with few designers only, Les Baer being one, i.e. Though at the cost of $5000 or so. [B]STILL WITH NO FTF/FTE GUARANTEE!\n\n[/B]The break-in is must, coz it''s not only about the friction between the parts, that you could just[I] lube out[/I]. \n \nA car is course given it''s motor oil before ignition, but it still necessitates a break-in.

"Broken-in" handguns by manufacturers would imply much steeper tallies than those we pay, but what if the handgun still delivers an FTF/FTE, are we gonna sue them?\n\nMoreover, it yields you confidence in your chosen SD measure, when you see it performing from your own hands.

(481337, ' Interesting question Salman Sahb.\nI believe "breaking in" has two aspects associated with it. The first being every machine or organism has an adjustment period to new functions or surroundings, where it might be prone to some sort of hiccup. Only because real world use can test the product completely. When a new race car is bought or even upgraded, it is run a great deal on lower rpm before it is taken on the track(its primary use). Since there are thousands of parts involved in the smooth function of that particular machine, even if manufactures go by six sigma standards ([URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma[/URL]) there is a chance(albeit small) that there might be a catastrophic failure.\nExample being the ferrari 458 Italia was tested for thousands of hours but only when it come into the real world did it have the catastrophic failure with its break pads(adhesive on break pads was combustible) and many of these beautiful machines were burnt to a crisp.  I would rather have this failure during run in period then on a track when I would be racing in Le Mans. Same applies towards handguns, I would rather test the product over and over before using it during time of duress.\nSecond part involves the smoothing of rough edges that many of the previous members have stated. That I believe is purely physiological as far as reliability of operation is concerned. A well designed, defect free firearm should be good to go from day one.', ''),

The problem with the "Break in period" definition I hv is when people suggest its acceptable to hv failures in primary function of firearms ( feed, fire and eject).[/QUOTE]\n\n Actually of all the levers the trigger is most important and triggers require to be smoothed out with firing.because gun are not made from one block of metal cut into different parts but rather assembled out of different parts using machines and people the friction will vary between parts and will be smoothed out by shooting done by the buyer..\n\n[quote]IN my opinion, that is giving manufacturers a free pass to cut corners and deliver an unfinished product and expect the user to spend upwards of 40k worth of ammunition, just to make the gun reliable(if that is even possible).[/quote]\nAgain this is from your perspective from manufacturers perpective since a gun is bought or firing at  range or for hunting or for Sd the buyer need to do he customizing of parts by breaking it in.And ammo doesn''t cost 40k in other parts of the world.\n\n[quote]Take the example of the Zastava pistol ( which is the benchmark of reliability in Pak) or the Glock ( benchmark internationally).\nThe Zastava is a crude handgun, with tooling/machining marks/irregularities on internal parts (and externally), however it will Chew up and spit out any JHP rounds straight outa the box, till the day the hands of the user develop arthritis. \nCan a CF-98 be smoothed out to feed armscor JHP reliably ?[/quote]\n\nThe reliability of Zastava M57 has a lot to do with the powerful cartridge it uses.the 9mm equivalent of the gun M88 requires a 200 to 300 round breakin and is sensitive with JHp''s tha are not +P\n\nCF98 is a mil-spec gun.It was built for PLA use and most miltaries don''t use JHP rounds in regular grunt guns. \n\n[quote]The Firearm that most associate with this break in period is the 1911, a hundred year old design. In a huge number of cases people send their 1911''s back to the manufacturer (internationally, where they can). Now if the manufacturers were to simply run a few hundred rounds through them and send them back then I would agree there is something as "Break in" improved reliability, however that is not the case, almost all of those 1911''s hv part replacements or some gunsmithing done to them. That to me is the definition of a repaired firearm.\nRegards.[/quote]\ni have yet to meet a or read about 1911 owner who is not up to the task of doing the break-in shooting on his/her 1911 because it''s the charm of owning such a tool.\n\nManufacturers do dry cycles weapons often hundreds of times to smooth it out almost all reputable makers do function check on manufactured weapons to to see that they don''t have serious failures in process.\n\nMost gun owners would rather buy a gun and find out what ammo works with it or what grip controls it.Can you imagine if glock starts recommending that owners only use Remington gold sabre rounds in their guns.The price in pakistan would be like 300 k  for gun and 75k for 25 rounds.\n\nAlso are you willing to pay extra for guns that have rounds run through them bearing in mind  that might double or triple the prices on the weapons.', ''),

Once i have it i will share the scan of the licence with you guys.\n\nAbout the pistol - My friend that was involved in it who recommended that dealer to me has said that he will get my pistol sold at the same price to another friend of his and i think that will be useful and really easy for me to buy a chinese pistol after that is sold so the money wasted on the pistol will be recovered.\n\nAbout the number issue then on this i was told that if do not get a number on my license in 3 days then i would be charged about 300 rs and my friend told me that not the dealer and about my friend he has given 3 other licenses to the dealer too of other of his friends and due to his recommendation i was there. \n\nAnyways i think you learn better when something hit you really bad.\n\nI was just here to know that if 14 Round Shot pistol is recommended or not but i have experienced that there are other serious issues going on with me about whom i have not even thought about...\n\nThanks againt to every one who is helping me and i will keep you updated about the situation with me.\n\nWith best regards,\nAli', ''),

I am sure conventional wisdom should state that the hole should be exactly the same size as the measurement that you took. guess what? no matter how many times you drill it and measure, all three (mentioned dia of the bit, measured dia of the bit, diameter of the hole) figures will never match with each other.\r\n\r\ntake another example:\r\ngo to the best machinist in your area and ask him to machine a simple 3/16 dia rod for you. instruct him to be as accurate as he can be. now take that rod and go to three different machinists and as tell them to take readings using their equipment. guess what? each machinist will give you unique readings. the exact reading will be different but they will give you an idea that this particular object was built around a 3/16 inch dia.\r\n\r\ntaking the same example further: take that rod, go to any tools supplier shop. take out each and every single vernier caliper and start measuring you''ll be astonished to the varying degree of measurements that you''ll get.\r\n\r\nso....how do we achieve accuracy (mechanical)? interesting question! you achieve accuracy or precision by defining a range. if a given fabricated object falls within that specified range, it is called "Accurately Manufactured"\r\n\r\nHaving worked on few "out of the box thinking" type projects where certain mechanical devices were conceived and built from ground up, I have learned that where multiple mechanical systems/parts interact, a break-in is absolutely necessary for the parts/systems to settle down with each other.\r\n\r\nnow kindly take the example of super accurate firearms. have you ever wondered that all precision firearms are almost always hand fitted. why? the reason is that no matter how accurate the machines are in producing their components there will always be a certain degree of deviation therefore necessitating the need for hand-fitting. you produce parts the utmost precision by machines then you assemble those parts by hand and manually settle them into their desired position. this is how you achieve precision which only the human hands are capable of, not the machines.\r\n\r\nnow moving on: breaking-in actually doesn''t produce accuracy in a firearm as a direct result. accuracy is consistency and break-in does exactly that. it makes all associated parts work together in a better way therefore their work becomes consistent with their intended job. so..... break-in produces accuracy as an indirect result.\r\n\r\nnow one can always ask themselves this question: how can we skip break-in? well.... brother for that you need to put in the same level of labor and attention to your firearm that is put in a high precision firearm.\r\n\r\nI am sorry for writing such a long story for this. I am afraid there wasn''t an easy or quick answer to this. there is still alot to be discussed on the topic and I feel that I haven''t even touched the subject: why all precision made firearms need even more break-in than regular firearms.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),
(481409, ' [QUOTE=SIGlock;319504]Thank you very much Glockcohlic and AK47 Brothers...! By the way, is there any possibility of getting an extended magazine floor plate to be installed on Rami''s 10 rounder...??? I mean double the size of the factory magazine floor plate...??? In fact, I have quite large hands and when I hold Rami with a 10 round mag, my pinky is totally in the air... :-( which makes it quite an uncomfortable grip... Actually I would prefer carrying Rami with a 10 round mag but with an extended floor plate so that I could get a good grip and serves the "real" purpose of CC... Just to give an idea, I have installed +3 magazine extensions on my G26 mags and with that, I get a perfect grip and its ability for CC is also not compromised... So please advise if there are any such magazine extensions available that could fit Rami''s 10 round mags and I''m not bothered whether the extension would add any extra round or not...[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro. there is one CZ 75 Extended Base Pad Long, Fits all Standard CZ 75 Magazines CZ 75 / P01 / PCR / SP01 / Phantom etc. The extended pad adds +4  rounds of 9mm, and CZ strongly suggest using full length 10% Mag spring for proper function. This could be the solution for you. As to me one of the problem might me associated with the mag spring and the grip extension. If the Grip Extension is properly seated and then the spring could be the culprit.  \r\n\r\nAs you have P01 as well then I will recommend that you try the following 2 options, see which one works for you to get the Rami firing without any problem associated with the mags:\r\n\r\n1: Get the P01''s mag and put the Rami''s Mag Grip Extension on to it. P01''s mag spring seems to be bit longer and it might work to rectify the problem\r\n\r\n2: Take out the P01''s mag spring and insert it to Rami''s 14 shot mag and see if it solves the problem.\r\n\r\nTry this and let us know.\r\n\r\nI am also planning to acquire the CZ 75 Extended Base Pad Long but the suggested long length spring is not available with them so I M waiting for the spring also to be sent together. Once with me I will try out this option for you and will let you know.', ''),

There is clearly visible consistency in groupings, smoother trigger break, less recoil, extreme spread reduces. Cocking effort reduces"\n\nIn the links you posted the "break in" process primarily effects Spring break guns, ( rubber seals and springs) and there is no implication that it affects accuracy.\n\n[quote]As the burrs wear down, the parts slide with less friction, which is where the cocking effort reduction comes from. It''s probably also where part of the velocity increase in the TX200 Mk III came from, but that begs a question. Why didn''t the Beeman R1 increase in velocity after the break-in? That''s because of one of those difference I talked about.Seals can wear in too ! [/quote]\n\nMy reply was purely for the perception of improved accuracy and tighter groups out of an air gun after you''ve shot a few thousand rounds or owned for a number for years. Objectively I cannot tell if its an increased skill at shooter level or Improved absolute performance of the airgun. \nRegarding spring tension reduction''s that''s norm, till a point comes that they get worn out.    \nAlso in the interest of staying on topic Spring-piston technology and airguns in general need to launch the pellet themselves where as firearms use a case filled with gunpowder to launch a projectile and then eject that case, Making airguns a different than pistols. For pistols its generally 3 variables that may be problematic, the mag, the round or the gun, in airguns, its all in the gun. I Hope you understood that last point.', ''),

Details of the people were given on phone, and photos were sent via mail or email,” the police source claimed.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]Following the revelations, the CIA staff recovered 30 CNICs and licences.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]However, the identification of the main operators of the gang is still unknown as they used operatives in cities and provided them with the materials but never revealed their own identity.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]Inspector General of Police Bani Amin Khan confirmed the arrest and termed it a great success. “It is very big scam,” the police chief added.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]The identification of the gang member is yet to be identified either they were criminals, militants or affiliated with militants outfit, the IGP said, adding, that “investigators are probing the case from all angles.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[FONT=inherit][/FONT]\n[FONT=inherit][/FONT]', ''),

I think you have been to an site where you see ads with movies which slow down the site but no one is going to use that ever ;). Check Siasat (DOT) pk that is a pakistani site and the same Vbulletin is used and only 3 ads are shown. They earn hundreds of thousands but that is not my favorite topic i mean siasat = Politics. \n\nAbout spamming : If a script is upgraded the spammers also update there bots for backlinks so Captcha can control some but most of them got advanced but still can be controlled and that problem is every where not just here. \n\nAnyways we are just giving suggestions everything depends on the administrators the real owners of the site and brother do not worry the things about you are worrying do exist and i think you have been to a forum like that but i am not going to let this site go down :D if it goes down you can test your new rifle or pistol at me :D But only if the sites goes down because of the ads if admin closes it i am not responsible ;) They are never gonna do that for sure :D\n\nTake Care,\nAli', ''),

(481863, ' Hi Khalid,\n\nDiana scopes are basic scopes which come cheap but not very effective if your target is precision shooting at different distances.\n\nFinding good mounts will be a waste of time in Dubai. The only scopes which will go well with your DIANA 350 Magnum are from Leapers Accushot series, provided you use a very high quality, single piece lock down mount, like the one from RWS. I have seen the mounts available in Al-Sayyad, but these will be a waste of money.\n\nThere is no chance of breaking your crosshair, even if your leapers scope is mounted on a 350 Mag. What most people do not realize is that they use typical rifle scopes on their airguns, these scopes are designed to accommodate backward recoil, but due to the forward recoil of the airgun, the crosshairs get damaged. You do not have to worry about this if the scope is designed for an airgun, and leapers is by far one of the best medium-priced brand available.\n\nMany years ago, someone told me that optics should always be nearly as expensive as the gun, and one should never compromise on the quality of the mount. I took this advice to my heart, ended up buying a 350 Magnum with Leapers Accushot scope and RWS lockdown elevated mount, and I still cherish this collection. Later on, I moved this scope to my Mod.35 (to give my arms & shoulders some rest), and it''s wonderful still.\n\nI highlighted the difference in the recommended RWS mounts and ones available in Dubai in an old thread. Below is the link, check last few posts here.\n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?8380-scope-mount[/url]\n\nI am in Riyadh but will be going back to Dubai next month. Maybe I will revisit the shop and see if they have some better mounts. Will update you during Dec.\n\nCheers!', ''),

The only reason why this site feels like a community and sends out a brother hood signal to every member is because, nobody is here for selfish gains(atleast not that i know of). The day you bring in advertisements etc into play, no doubt Abbass(administrator) would earn money, but the page loadings would become a bigger hassle, spam attacks would get frequent and honestly Pakguns would lose most of its charm.\n\nThis site represents the prime breed of Gentlemen from Pakistan sharing their love for guns with each other, if we bring money into the equation then in my honest opinion things would become disorderly and uncivil!!!\n\nThis site has gained popularity coz of its strict standards and I personally wouldnt want them to be compromised upon for earning money!!![/QUOTE]\n\nDear brother, \n\nI was just mentioning how much they can earn and i am not forcing any one in to this but why i  mentioned that stuff is because the current host of pakguns is nimbushosting and if the pakguns is using there cheapeast package then per year they have to pay 210Gbp = 31920 Rs and how much brotherly have we been with them and how much have we supported them???? \n\nAlso i mentioned that Pakgun should update to Vbulletin 5 and do you know the cost of that? It is 209US for an update and who is going to support our Pakguns on that???? \n\nSo the way i could support them i have told them and if they want the ads to go on then i will gurantee them 100% that the site is never going to go slow, If we update to Vbulletin 5 itself that is going to keep the spam out and ads never bring spam because we are not going to use illegal ad support. Also only 2 ads will be permitted so there is not going to be rush of the ads. I will just tell the admins the way how they should do this but it depends on them again everything will be in there control i am not forcing any one. \n\nThe main benefit of this can be that the owner of this site can buy an Dedicated Server too if the earning goes well :) and a lot can be done with the money. In a month all the expenditure which the site is currently on will cleared.\n\n I have helped many of my friends in this online earning and why shared the info with pakguns is because they supported me and they are actually on the web presenting PAKISTANI Guns like other countries presenting there. \n\nIf our site will be famous and on top then for sure we are going to send the message to the world and guys here are awesome they answer you really quick there are forum which are absolutely dead. \n\nAnyways i have written too much now which get annoying sometime ;)\n\nWith best regards,\nAli', ''),

(481899, ' [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nOne can use brass brush to clean the barrels with no ill effects as it does not harm the barrel or chrome lining being a lot softer than steel (barrel''s) or chrome lining. same principle also applies to steel wool. it is a lot softer than barrel steel therefore cannot harm barrel or its chrome lining.\r\n\r\nthere are very common misconceptions about chrome lining. when we see inside the barrel under a light source, we see it shinning like a mirror. automatically we assume that it is white chrome and associate it with the chrome we see on car bumpers or motorcycle fenders. the chrome you see on cars and similar objects is actually decorative chrome which gives white shine. decorative chrome is for (obviously!) decorative purposes and is a very soft and fragile layer of chrome.\r\n\r\non the other hand, the chrome lining inside the barrel is not decorative, its industrial hard-chrome. which is way (read: a lot more) harder then steel (barrel or wool) and in reality it is  metallic grey to light grey in color.\r\n\r\nthen there is another very common misunderstanding that firearms are weak, soft and fragile objects which can be easily broken if not pampered like a baby.\r\n\r\nwhat makes this misunderstanding more funny and humorous is that people routinely refer to their firearms as "Built like a Tank", "Virtually Indestructible" and "Literally Bomb-Proof" but pamper it like its some kind of a toy made of plastic. lols!\r\n\r\nthey would swear on forums, chat rooms, blogs and in real person conversations about their firearms ability to withstand almost any abuse man can cook up but unable muster up the courage to even clean it properly with the fear of breaking it. hahahahhaha!\r\n\r\nAnyways, back on the topic: steel wool is fine. I routinely clean using steel wool and chucking the end of the cleaning rod in a variable drill machine set at low speeds. if i am not feeling like taking the drill out, I have found that fine (high quality) automotive compound paste works just as well. the one that looks like a white dairy product (whipped cream/yogurt). just clean your barrel then apply some compound paste on a patch of clean cloth, hook it up with your cleaning rod and then go in and out of the barrel till everything becomes shiny. you might have to apply more then 5 patches to cover the whole barrel bore. in the end, the barrel will look like "New in Box" new.\r\n\r\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\r\n\r\na firearm''s barrel is designed to be subjected to extreme friction/wear and force/pressure. however it is not designed to withstand chemical abuse. keep that in mind next time you take out your barrel for cleaning. in reality you are destroying your barrel more through the use of specialty firearm cleaning fluids than by steel wool or brass brush. specialty cleaning fluids/solvent are designed to make the cleaning job easier for the person who is cleaning. not to make it easier on the thing that you are cleaning.\r\n\r\ndid I mention that if you look at industrial hard chrome under a microscope, you''ll find small cracks. these small cracks let these specialty firearm cleaning products seep in and destroy the substrate which is holding the chrome plating in its place. that substrate which is usually copper acts like glue. now what happens when the glue is gone? ;)\r\n\r\nanother thing I probably forgot to mention that these specialty firearm cleaning fluids mostly contain industrial strength solvents that dissolve copper and carbon. these fluids are mostly known to be carcinogens, that is, they can cause cancer with prolonged use or body contact. now you decide which is a better cleaning method.\r\n\r\nmost common commercial firearm cleaning fluids contain ammonia and acetone or MEK. ammonia dissolves copper substrate whereas acetone is harmful to aluminum.\r\n\r\n[B]My preference: [/B]\r\n\r\n1. spray the barrel with ordinary brake cleaner a couple of times.\r\n2. run a few patches (cloth) through the barrel to remove any lose carbon fouling\r\n3. run a few more patches (tightly fit) to clean it as much as I can\r\n4a. Steel wool chucked into a variable speed drill OR\r\n4b. Automotive Compound Paste on a few patches chucked into a variable speed drill OR\r\n4c. Automotive Compound Paste on a few patches and some exercise going in and out. That sounds Naughty, right? ;)\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

It is 209US for an update and who is going to support our Pakguns on that???? \n\nSo the way i could support them i have told them and if they want the ads to go on then i will gurantee them 100% that the site is never going to go slow, If we update to Vbulletin 5 itself that is going to keep the spam out and ads never bring spam because we are not going to use illegal ad support.

(481912, ' [QUOTE=armoured;320029]Hi Khalid,\n\nDiana scopes are basic scopes which come cheap but not very effective if your target is precision shooting at different distances.\n\nFinding good mounts will be a waste of time in Dubai. The only scopes which will go well with your DIANA 350 Magnum are from Leapers Accushot series, provided you use a very high quality, single piece lock down mount, like the one from RWS. I have seen the mounts available in Al-Sayyad, but these will be a waste of money.\n\nThere is no chance of breaking your crosshair, even if your leapers scope is mounted on a 350 Mag. What most people do not realize is that they use typical rifle scopes on their airguns, these scopes are designed to accommodate backward recoil, but due to the forward recoil of the airgun, the crosshairs get damaged. You do not have to worry about this if the scope is designed for an airgun, and leapers is by far one of the best medium-priced brand available.\n\nMany years ago, someone told me that optics should always be nearly as expensive as the gun, and one should never compromise on the quality of the mount. I took this advice to my heart, ended up buying a 350 Magnum with Leapers Accushot scope and RWS lockdown elevated mount, and I still cherish this collection. Later on, I moved this scope to my Mod.35 (to give my arms & shoulders some rest), and it''s wonderful still.\n\nI highlighted the difference in the recommended RWS mounts and ones available in Dubai in an old thread.

(481935, 'Unusual Pistols 1: AMT Auto Mag There are many pistols in current and former production, but the vast majority of them are much the same; variants of the Colt revolver, small or large FN Browning, Colt 1911, or Glock.  But there have occasionally been some very unusual guns made.  Usually they failed in the market, sometimes due to excessive cost, incompetence from their manufacturers, or design flaws. \n\n The first gun I''m going to describe is the AMT Auto Mag.  It was built from 1970 through the mid 1980s by thirteen different companies in at least four different American states.  The Auto Mag was a short-recoil operated rotary bolt design.  When fired, the upper part of the gun moved back about 7mm.  A curved track twisted the bolt out of the locking lugs in the upper and the bolt and cocking piece moved back under their own inertia, then were pulled back forward to strip the next cartridge off the magazine and feed it into the chamber.\n\n The Auto Mags were made from stainless steel, still unusual in 1970, and initially chambered in .44 AMP, or Auto Mag Pistol.  The cartridge was made by cutting down a .308 rifle case to make, basically, a rimless .44 Magnum.  Later, the .44 case was bottlenecked to make a .357 and .41.  Somewhere along the way, a handful of Auto Mags were chambered for .45 Winchester Magnum.\n\n The Auto Mag is a BIG gun, as large as a Desert Eagle.  It was designed for  big game hunting and silhouette shooting, a sport popular in California and Mexico at the time.  Silhouette contestants fired at outlines of animals cut out of steel plates, set at various distances.  Scoring was simple - you had to knock the steel plates down to get points.  The size and weight of some of the plates meant silhouette shooting favored powerful cartridges.\n\n The Auto Mags were rushed into production before being fully debugged, and they were sensitive to the type of ammunition used.  The factory was usually reorganizing, going bankrupt, or just recovering from bankruptcy, and it wasn''t until the 1980s that some of the Auto Mag''s problems were addressed.  The price had also gone up from $200 to over $1000 in ten years; in 1980, I made $400 a month.  A few years ago another company thought they would get rich building Auto Mags and advertised them at over $5000 Real Soon Now.  A few months later their phone was disconnected and their web site went 404.\n\n Not many people even knew the Auto Mag existed.  A few magazine articles, a handful of gun shops, nothing widespread.  Most people first saw one in Clint Eastwood''s movie "Sudden Impact" in 1983.  Every previous Dirty Harry movie resulted in a sales spike for Smith & Wesson''s Model 29, but not even Dirty Harry could get people to pay so much money for an Auto Mag.  The company moved on to other designs, and the Auto Mag was forgotten again.  There were maybe 6,000 Auto Mags made.', ''),

(481949, 'Armes Unique .22 Pistol/Carbine Salams,\r\n\r\nI want to share a rare gun made by Armes Unique France. This is in .22 Caliber and can be converted to a pistol or a Rifle by very simple method. Fortunately I own this gun from my father and this is the first one from which I started using Firearms. Right now this gun is in my village, but I am sharing the pictures from internet which wholly resembles it.\r\n\r\nFrom internet information I found that this pistol/carbine was manufactured by armes unique France in 1960''s. And that time it costed around $80. It has 18" barrel when using as a rifle and it weights around 4kg only. \r\n\r\nIt has a 10 shot .22 LR magazine and works in semi-auto. \r\n\r\nThe pictures will tell the story itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen using it as a rifle\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/8cda77fa3ddadc59b56ee451dd1b0f5c.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nWhen using it as a pistol\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/1e052437d21103892d006802334b2d97.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI also attached a scope to it, but I have not removed the rear sight as in this picture the rear sight is removed.

(481952, ' The method of changing between pistol and rifle is, lock the slide of pistol back and remove the small barrel, then attach it with the rifle and release the slide using the slide release.

I am mostly traveling and have not touched a gun since last 9 months which is quite frustrating.\n\nHi Khalid,\n\nSome more points regarding scope mounts for Diana:\n\nThere should be only one lock down pin at the rear top end of the mount, which goes into the dovetail rail vertically. You will notice that each Diana dovetail has a small hole in the rear.  \n\n[url]http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/images/54-scop-rail-web.jpg[/url]\n\nThe lock down pin should go in this hole.\n\nThere are however 2,3,4 tightening screws on the side (depending which mount you are using). There are few very important points to consider while buying mount for Diana:\n\n1. Make sure its a single piece mount, with a lockdown pin in the rear of the mount\n2. Length of the mount should be equal to the dovetail rail for best fit.\n3. Mount should have elevation towards the front. This is most important, as a mount without elevation in the front, will always keep the scope exactly parallel to the muzzle, which means that the crosshair and pellets never intercept each other at any distance. Result: No matter how much you try to zero your scope, you are always shooting higher', ''),

It can be flown upon quails and up to dove sized quarry.\n\nThe females are larger and more aggressive than the males. In falcons, the price difference between males and females is mind boggling.

I''ve been wanting to buy a shotgun for a while now, after abit of research initially I was going to go for the Hatsan Escort but when rang a reliable dealer today he did not have the Hatsan Escort in stock. BUT instead he has the Hatsan Escort Combo available (with 2 barrels) and quoted me 56K Price. I am now thinking that perhaps getting the Hatsan Escort Combo may be a better idea as it comes with two barrels, 1 for HD and other for Hunting.  \n \n My questions frm the experts here are:\n \n1) Is Hatsan a good and reliable make and its shotguns are of good quality?\n \n2) Is Hastan Escort Combo a good shotgun to get? both for Home Defence and Hunting?\n \n3) Does it fire slug?\n \n4) and Is [B]56K [/B]a good price for Hatsan Escort Combo (Black Plastic Version)?  (this is the asking price that was quoted over the phone, the dealer did say that when we go to the shop he will knock off abit more money and will look after us, how much exactly I dont know yet)\n \nI am not a professional hunter but this may be a start for me to join my friends who hunt regularly.

Report\nKARACHI: Licensed weapons were being used in target killings in Karachi while illegal arms makes only 20 percent of the total arms seized by Law enforcing agencies, this was revealed by the Sindh Home Department in a meeting of the Standing committee on human rights presided over by Federal minister PML-Q MNA Riaz Fatyana here in the committee room of Sindh Assembly on Thursday.\nThe meeting was attended by members National Assembly, Attiya Inayatullah and Khushbakht Shujaat, Consultant to Sindh Home Department Sharfuddin Memon, Additional Secretary Interior Sindh Waseem Ahmed, Chief CPLC Ahmed Chinoy and other officials. \nWhile briefing the Standing Committee on Human Rights about the Law and order situation in Karachi both the Sindh Police department and Citizens Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) presented their figures in the meeting. According to official figures 1732 persons were killed in 9 months of this year. Out of those being killed 1297 were murdered as result of personal enmity, 54 were killed during snatching while 306 became the victims of politically motivated target killings. The causes of death of the remaining 75 could not be ascertained. \nThe SC was informed that 224 cases of extortion were registered in 2011 whereas the figure reached to 288 in the first 9 months of 2012. Extortion money was collected in all part of the city. According to police, 151 target killers were arrested including Imran Butt, Muhammad Saeed Anwar Bangali, Saeed Ahmed alias Garam, Ameer Zaib alias Bawani, Muhammad Arshad, Zeeshan Jafri, Saba Haider, Sheeraz Ahmed, Hussain Ahmed, Mushtaq Khan and others.\nThe committee was informed that 273 persons were kidnapped in 2011 whereas the figure reached to 268 in the first 9 months of 2012. Out of them 90 people were kidnapped in Karachi, 80 of them were recovered. According to CPLC, 243 children went missing in Sindh out of which 13 were found dead while 65 were recovered and 60 are still missing.

The committee was informed that most of the police personal remain busy in providing security to the VIPs. \nThe standing Committee in its recommendations to the governor Sindh suggested the city should be freed of illegal weapons in the first phase and then licensed arms should seized which is used in the target killings. The number of police providing security to VIPs should be decreased according to the red book. The data of missing persons and dead bodies of unknown persons should be collected and maintained. SC also suggested measures should be taken for closing the unregistered Sims cards which are used in crimes.\nThe registration of rental houses and installation of surveillance camera at the entering and exit points of the city and establishing of training schools for the law enforcement agencies was also suggested in the committee''s recommendations. \nChairmen SC Riaz Fatyana suggested the governor Sindh should free Karachi from arms and take measures for ending the political backing of the criminal elements. \n"This is our first visit to Karachi but not last. The law enforcement agencies should give result and Political leader should support them" said Riaz Fatyana while addressing the meeting. He said that everyone including policemen and judges seem to be terrified in the city. \nAttiya Inayatullah said there was a difference between the sectarian killings in Karachi and Gilgit. "We just can''t blame the police when the accused are freed with the intervention by the political leadership" she maintained. \nAdditional Secretary Interior Sindh Waseem Ahmed told that the number of police should be almost doubled. He said the only 20 percent of the weapons recovered are illegal. Most of the killings are done through licensed weapons.\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

They make constitutions remember?  :D[/QUOTE]\n\n[URL]http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-143668-Kalashnikov-culture-bows-out-to-the-9mm-era[/URL]\n\n[B]Karachi\n \nIts small size makes it easy to carry concealed. It is available in abundance, and only a few thousand rupees are needed to fetch one. To top it all, it can fire up to 25 rounds with a single magazine. It is no wonder then that a 9mm pistol is the most preferred weapon of Karachi’s target killers. Senior police officials say the fearsome weapon is used in 80 percent of the target killings in the city.\n \n“There was a time when the groups involved in target killings in the city used Kalashnikovs,” SSP Raja Umer Khattab of the Crime Investigation Department (CID) Sindh’s Counter Terrorism and Financial Crime Unit told The News.\n \n“But after the introduction of the 9mm pistol, these groups, particularly banned militant outfits, have started using this weapon because it’s semi-automatic, small in size and easy to carry. This accounts for the weapon being used in a vast majority of the target killings in the city.”\n \nThe police official said a 30-bore pistol was rarely used in target killings as its magazine had a capacity of only six or seven bullets. “That’s why criminals prefer a 9mm pistol because its magazines can accommodate between 15 and 30 rounds.”\n \nTalking to The News, SSP Mohammad Aslam Khan of the CID Sindh’s Anti-Extremism Cell concurred with his colleague’s observations.\n \n“When using a 30-bore pistol, there is a chance of the bullet getting stuck inside the barrel.”\n \nKhan also disclosed that target killers sometimes used hollow-point bullets that had a small pit in their tips.\n \n“These bullets expand when they enter the body and cause maximum damage to the vital organs.”\n \nWhere do they come from?\n \nSSP Khattab said the 9mm pistol was the official weapon of Nato troops. “They are usually smuggled into Pakistan from neighbouring countries.”\n \nHe said at first the 9mm pistols found in the city were usually China-made. Later, the model of this weapon manufactured in Darra Adam Khel also became abundant due to its cheap rates.\n \n“The prices of the 9mm pistol, depending on the company that manufactured it, range between Rs15,000 and Rs500,000.”\n \nShedding more light on the issue, SSP Khan said there were several versions of the 9mm pistol manufactured in Turkey, Malaysia and Austria.\n \n“The Austria-made Glock is the most expensive 9mm pistol, costing around Rs1 million.”\n \nKhan said imported 9mm pistols were used in some high-profile murders, but target killers usually preferred the locally manufactured versions.\n \nThe China-made CF-98\n \nSSP Khattab said the 9mm pistol currently used by most of the city’s target killers was the China-made CF-98 model.\n \n“A few months ago, members of a banned outfit, Jundullah, carried out an attack at the City Courts in which they used the CF-98 and managed to free their arrested associates. In another case, a pistol of the same model was found at a crime scene following police’s encounter with criminals.”\n \nThe SSP said police had busted some gangs that acquired imported weapons through weapons dealers. “It was easy to catch them because the Customs had the record of the weapons’ importer.”\n \nThe police official added that weapons manufactured in Dara Adam Khel were smuggled into Karachi through intercity buses and trains.\n \nModus operandi\n \nKhattab said the city’s criminals groups expertly changed the serial numbers on 9mm pistols. “The modus operandi of these groups is that they first manage to get weapon\n \nlicences. Then they buy four or five 9mm pistols and punch the numbers mentioned on their licence papers on them.”\n \nSpeaking about the firing kits used in 9mm pistols that make them fully automatic, the SSP said target killers hardly made this alteration to their weapons. “It makes the pistol harder to handle.”\n \nBuilt to kill\n \nAccording to the information about the pistol available on the Internet, a 9mm pistol is semi-automatic, chambered for the Nato standard 9mm x 19mm pistol round. This round is also known as the 9mm luger and 9mm parabellum. Some modern literature refers to the gun as a “hi-power”, while it was earlier referred to as a “high-power”. This is a translation from its original title, “grand puissance”, given to it by the Belgian weapons manufacturer, Fabrique National d’armes de guerre (FN).\n \nThe pistol was designed by John Moses Browning in the 1920s for the FN. It first went into production in 1935. Browning died in 1927. The final design work was carried out by an FN employee, Dieudonne Saive.\n \nSome armouries have produced copies with the help of FN, while some countries have produced unauthorised “knock-offs”. Of the various clones, some are exact copies and have parts interchangeable with the FN guns.\n \nAt various times during its history, the High-Power has been the issue sidearm in over fifty countries. Browning High-Power pistols were used during WW2 by both the axis powers and the allies.\n \nMeanwhile, the police are now trying to curb the use of this deadly weapon for target killings in the city. They intend to compile data on the arms dealers and verify whether they are registered or not. Then also intend to initiate a crackdown against illegal dealers and boost surveillance at railway stations and entry points to the city to prevent the smuggling of this deadly weapon.\n \n[/B]', ''),

Same packing . same box. same manual. even the same weapon. same waight same features. \n\nAnd should be close to the price of a betty. \n\nAs regards a wheel gun.. There are .32s available in black.

(482837, 'a piece of history [Here is something I wrote a year or so ago.  I thought you might enjoy it.]\r\n\r\n I dug my Mauser out the other day. I haven''t shot it since... uh... 1987, best as I can figure. I have about 60 rounds of homemade 7.65x53 I loaded about the same time. One box of 20 has the characteristic round shoulders left by the swaging die that reforms .30-''06 brass to 7.65. The shoulders don''t get crisp until the round is fired once.\r\n \r\n 1891:\r\n \r\n In the American West, the Dalton Gang was in the news. \r\n \r\n In the citified east, Thomas Alva Edison gave the first demonstration of moving pictures via his new "kinetoscope."\r\n \r\n In the village of Ranshofen in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a boy named Adolf turned two. His parents went to church and prayed for his health; he was their fourth child. Two boys and a girl had all died before reaching their third year.\r\n \r\n In the Third Republic of France, Michelin patented the pneumatic tire.\r\n \r\n In Imperial Russia, Tsar Alexander''s armorers approved the "3-line rifle, Model 1891," though production was not scheduled to start until the next year. He also started construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway.\r\n \r\n In the British Empire, "The Strand" in London printed the first Sherlock Holmes story. Across town, Freidrich Engels was finishing up "Das Kapital" after the death of its original writer, his friend Karl Marx. \r\n \r\n In the Second Reich of Germany, an inspector in the ultra-modern steam-powered, gaslit Mauser-Werke factory in Berlin drove a hardened steel stamp into the barrel of a rifle. It marked the rifle as proofed by the authority of His Imperial and Royal Majesty Wilhelm the Second, by the Grace of God, German Emperor and King of Prussia.\r\n \r\n \r\n And now, 120 years later and on a different continent, that same rifle is leaning against the side of my desk. The Reich and the House of Hohenzollern are no more, and Mauser-Werke exists only as a brand name in a corporate conglomerate. It has been a quarter of a century since it was last fired. But when I settle it onto the sandbag at the range next week, I expect it will perform flawlessly, as it always has before.\r\n\r\n There are few modern sporting rifles that match the Model of 1891 as far as quality of construction. The 1891 wasn''t designed for sale to individuals, but to governments, in an era when rifles were still considered a capital investment, and were expected to last indefinitely. I have never found the price the 1891 sold for, or then-current exchange rate between the Reich and government of Argentina, but I expect that rifle cost at least the same as a year''s pay for the soldier who carried it. By modern standards the detail on the 1891 is insane; the magazine follower is whittled out of bar stock and polished, and the blue job... of course, the 1891 was designed for export, and "pretty" is always a selling point, even for military weapons. The Model of 1891 isn''t "better quality" than my Romanian AK-47; I expect the Romy will perform just as reliably on its 120th birthday. The two rifles are the end products of very different engineering decision trees, their only real similarity being that they both shoot a .311 diameter bullet.\r\n \r\n Even knowing that, I still love the smooth snick of the polished, oiled Mauser parts sliding against each other. That feel doesn''t make it shoot any better, but I bet it impressed that long-ago Argentine purchasing agent as much as it does me. "This is a firearm of the highest quality, one that our soldiers will be proud to carry, that will serve our nation reliably for many years to come."', ''),

(482840, ' When the US Army adopted the .308 they came up with a way to shoot .308 in some .30-06 rifles.  Basically, it was a bushing that pressed into the .30-06 chamber.  The front was shaped to match the shoulder of the ''06, the back was shaped to provide the proper headspace for a .308.  I''ve always assumed it was intended for the ''03 Springfield and 1917 Enfield, which were still in reserve armories at that time.\r\n\r\n The adapter adds to the "freebore", or distance between the front of the bullet and the start of the rifling.  Though target shooters now minimize freebore, the Army apparently felt it wasn''t a problem.\r\n\r\n I haven''t seen any of the bushings for sale in a long time, but someone with a lathe could make one easily enough.  It''s not a stressed part, so any chicken-wire-grade steel (or even brass) would be sufficient.  \r\n\r\n Such a bushing would be much simpler and cheaper than having the rifle rebarreled to .308.', ''),

Now that era is gone. To many turf wars too many no  go areas too many extortioniasts. \n\nThe MQM''s stand is that first illigal weapons should be eliminated and  then legal ones since there would be no need for em. The ANP''s stand is  the reverse. They say that since we have the data bout legal guns here  in Karachi. Lets get rid of htem first at least. Then we will see bout  illegal ones.  \n\nhad they succeeded in having this bill passed karachi would have been  the only city in the country where there would not have been any legal  weapons around.  \n\nHowever by foisting in on the whole country they have effectively  ensured that it will never be passed. It is easy to disarm a localised  urban middle class but to do it all over the country lock stock and  barrel (bad pun intended) quite difficult.

On the other hand, everyone seems to have something good to say about the build quality of the SXP. This is the crux of the confusion.\n\nThe SXP also seems to have benefited from some design improvements too, like fewer moving parts and is said to have an even smoother slide than the 1300.

Hammering through the path will guide it out easily.  Secondly, a dud, squib or aka whatever... under powered ammo will NOT damage barrel unless the user fires another round behind it.

Only pistol grip and small barrel.\nFazal Kareem of United Arms Saddar Rawalpindi is selling a new one for PKR 120,000 (fixed).\nLet me assure you that the metallurgy of US arms is a hundred times  better than Turkish weapons. I have used both American and Turkish  Winchesters. I still have the 1300 Defender as my bedside companion  whereas the Turkish didnt last a month with me! I had issues with the  fire-pin to start with. Fazal Kareem refused to change the weapon the  very next day of my purchase. I had it fixed from elsewhere but the gun  started rattling after 3 boxes of SG (Shaheen). I sold it for nearly  half the price I bought it for. So........Never Ever will I buy a  Turkish weapon again.\nAnd about Mr Fazal Kareem of United Arms, Saddar, Pindi; the guy is the  biggest cheat in the market! Elahi Buksh is a rip-off fair enough but Mr  Kareem is known to remove origional parts from weapons and replace them  with local ones. Happened to me and a friend on two occasions. He had  changed the fire-pins of a Baikal 27 I bought from him which started  missing shots on its first hunt. Upon inspection by Abbas of Daudsons  Armory I was shown the crudely made local fire-pins. I confronted him  and he took the pins out of the new shotgun he had in stock and put it  in my shotgun but refused to take the gun back. So....stay away from  Turkish Winchester if US is available and avoid Fazal Kareem of United  Arms. He also sells sub-standard Shaheen Cartridges. When you complain  he changes the box saying ''kabhi kabhi aik dabba aisa nikal aata  hai''....lol!\n\n\nRegards', ''),

(483258, ' [QUOTE=Skeeter60;318455] it made a very little sound, he then proceeded to fire the 51st shot in the same barrel when the barrel blew.\nI then told him that without the weight and pressure of lead shot the propellant only partially ignites and the shot cup/over powder wad gets stuck in the barrel and the follow up shot blew his barrel. He immediately agreed that this was his mistake.\nHow ever measures are being taken at the POFs to ensure the crimp is tight and does not allow even fine shot like 8 and 9 to spill out.[/QUOTE]\n\nI am so struggling with this whole thing and trying to reason with it due to the fact that Beretta is such a reputed manufacturer whose test standards surpass any firearm manufacturer of the world.\n\nWads are flimsy plastic pieces to create separation between powder and shot. Primer 209 which is used in shot gun shells does sound like a "patakha" if powder is missing and produces flame almost 4 inches long. How do I know? I reload my shells and had made mistakes of missing powder but in many cases just primer was enough to push wad out and shot come out of barrel end like a spit. This one was told to be loose crimp so should have been easier to be pushed out.\nSo what happened in this case?\n\nWe all know that factory reloading is done on high speed machines and shells are produced sequentially and packed sequentially at the same time. No one produces a pile and then pack them. So what is the probability of having a no powder and double powder right next to each other - - - produced and packed just like that? \nI think, very high. Shooter should have closely examined both shells to find evidence of ignition of powder. I am confident that it was most likely shell which should have been connected to manufacturer and who should be paying for any losses. Alhamdulillah, shooter was safe, he should give sadqa for that.\n\nPoint I am trying to make here is:  Inspect condition of your firearm and ammo before using it. At the end you as a shooter is responsible for your own and other''s safety. overwhelming majority of similar accidents are related to ammo, not the firearm. However, if someone take a 100 year old coach gun (side by side double barrel) and use modern ammo, I would be very cautious due to the fact modern powders burn very fast and produce pressures super fast.\n\nHope I am making some sense. . . . . .', ''),

Only pistol grip and small barrel.\nFazal Kareem of United Arms Saddar Rawalpindi is selling a new one for PKR 120,000 (fixed).\nLet me assure you that the metallurgy of US arms is a hundred times  better than Turkish weapons. I have used both American and Turkish  Winchesters. I still have the 1300 Defender as my bedside companion  whereas the Turkish didnt last a month with me! I had issues with the  fire-pin to start with. Fazal Kareem refused to change the weapon the  very next day of my purchase. I had it fixed from elsewhere but the gun  started rattling after 3 boxes of SG (Shaheen). I sold it for nearly  half the price I bought it for. So........Never Ever will I buy a  Turkish weapon again.\nAnd about Mr Fazal Kareem of United Arms, Saddar, Pindi; the guy is the  biggest cheat in the market! Elahi Buksh is a rip-off fair enough but Mr  Kareem is known to remove origional parts from weapons and replace them  with local ones. Happened to me and a friend on two occasions. He had  changed the fire-pins of a Baikal 27 I bought from him which started  missing shots on its first hunt. Upon inspection by Abbas of Daudsons  Armory I was shown the crudely made local fire-pins. I confronted him  and he took the pins out of the new shotgun he had in stock and put it  in my shotgun but refused to take the gun back. So....stay away from  Turkish Winchester if US is available and avoid Fazal Kareem of United  Arms. He also sells sub-standard Shaheen Cartridges. When you complain  he changes the box saying ''kabhi kabhi aik dabba aisa nikal aata  hai''....lol!\n\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\n\nThe comments in the thread below suggest the 1300 was made very cheaply so it could be supplied at the least cost to the consumer market.

(483593, ' [QUOTE=Amjad Ali;160546]LEVER ACTION is very rare in pakistan .[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n The lever action was invented in America in the mid-1800s.  A few were used in the American Civil War, but after that the US military went back to single shot breech loaders for a while before adopting various bolt action designs.\r\n\r\n Carbine-length lever rifles were immensely popular with civilians and law enforcement in the western lands and territories, which is one reason you see so many of them in cowboy movies.  The lever action could be operated quickly, and their magazines held up to 34 rounds of ammunition (the Evans with its helical magazine) in an age when most militaries thought 5 rounds was enough, and soldiers were supposed to use a "magazine cut-off" to turn them into single-shots unless authorized to shoot from the magazine.\r\n\r\n Most militaries went to bolt actions because they envisioned their soldiers laying on the ground or in trenches, shooting from very low to the ground.  The lever rifles needed clearance to work the lever... but they could be fired easily from either hand, making them much more useful then bolt actions for use on horseback, such as by cowboys or mounted hunters.\r\n\r\n Winchester''s Model 1895 fed from a box magazine and had a stronger action than any previous lever rifle.  Imperial Russia bought over 300,000 rifles chambered in 7.62x54R, out of about 425,000 made overall.  After Russia''s cavalry was replaced by mechanized units the rifles were passed on to security forces or Soviet allies; they eventually showed up all over the former Soviet Bloc and in places like Finland.\r\n\r\n "Cowboy action shooting" is a popular sport in America now, but not many lever rifles are made here any more, and prices are extremely high as the manufacturers keep supplies short and promote "premium" and "super premium" fancy models instead of working guns.  Many shooters turn to imports made in Italy or Brazil to get something they can afford.\r\n\r\n Though not so common any more, it was once popular to select your rifle and pistol to use the same cartridge - .38-55 or .44-40 in the old days, .357 or .44 Magnum later.  You only had to carry one kind of ammunition, and the rifle gave greater accuracy and range when something was too far away to hit with a pistol.  Plus the short pistol cartridges meant the rifle''s ammunition capacity could be much higher than the usual six shots from a revolver.\r\n\r\n Outside of the American West and the Russian cavalry, lever guns were never that popular, though.  It''s not surprising they would be rare in Pakistan.', ''),

(Effectiveness in this case i took as potential stopping power in which it is assumed that the higher muzzle energy would result in higher effectiveness).\n\nI came to a personal conclusion that carrying a .357 mag 2inch snubbie may NOT be such a great idea given the following:\n1- the huge recoil , which makes it very difficult to come back on target.\n2- the huge muzzle blast and weapon report, which does not make it ideal for discharging it in an enclosed environment such as a vehicle or a house (for self defence).\n\nThe muzzle energy of a .357 mag fired from a 2inch revolver barrel is almost similar to a 9x18 fired from a 2inch (breech face to muzzle length) pistol barrel.\n\n.357 magnums start to outshine 9x18''s phenomenally in longer barrels.\nHence my surprise and  my ongoing search for a good  and reasonably priced sub-compact 9x18 to replace my snubbie.', ''),

(483776, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;320065][B]AoA Everybody[/B]\n\nOne can use brass brush to clean the barrels with no ill effects as it does not harm the barrel or chrome lining being a lot softer than steel (barrel''s) or chrome lining. same principle also applies to steel wool. it is a lot softer than barrel steel therefore cannot harm barrel or its chrome lining.\n\nthere are very common misconceptions about chrome lining. when we see inside the barrel under a light source, we see it shinning like a mirror. automatically we assume that it is white chrome and associate it with the chrome we see on car bumpers or motorcycle fenders. the chrome you see on cars and similar objects is actually decorative chrome which gives white shine. decorative chrome is for (obviously!) decorative purposes and is a very soft and fragile layer of chrome.\n\non the other hand, the chrome lining inside the barrel is not decorative, its industrial hard-chrome. which is way (read: a lot more) harder then steel (barrel or wool) and in reality it is  metallic grey to light grey in color.\n\nthen there is another very common misunderstanding that firearms are weak, soft and fragile objects which can be easily broken if not pampered like a baby.\n\nwhat makes this misunderstanding more funny and humorous is that people routinely refer to their firearms as "Built like a Tank", "Virtually Indestructible" and "Literally Bomb-Proof" but pamper it like its some kind of a toy made of plastic. lols!\n\nthey would swear on forums, chat rooms, blogs and in real person conversations about their firearms ability to withstand almost any abuse man can cook up but unable muster up the courage to even clean it properly with the fear of breaking it. hahahahhaha!\n\nAnyways, back on the topic: steel wool is fine. I routinely clean using steel wool and chucking the end of the cleaning rod in a variable drill machine set at low speeds. if i am not feeling like taking the drill out, I have found that fine (high quality) automotive compound paste works just as well. the one that looks like a white dairy product (whipped cream/yogurt). just clean your barrel then apply some compound paste on a patch of clean cloth, hook it up with your cleaning rod and then go in and out of the barrel till everything becomes shiny. you might have to apply more then 5 patches to cover the whole barrel bore. in the end, the barrel will look like "New in Box" new.\n\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\n\na firearm''s barrel is designed to be subjected to extreme friction/wear and force/pressure. however it is not designed to withstand chemical abuse. keep that in mind next time you take out your barrel for cleaning. in reality you are destroying your barrel more through the use of specialty firearm cleaning fluids than by steel wool or brass brush. specialty cleaning fluids/solvent are designed to make the cleaning job easier for the person who is cleaning. not to make it easier on the thing that you are cleaning.\n\ndid I mention that if you look at industrial hard chrome under a microscope, you''ll find small cracks. these small cracks let these specialty firearm cleaning products seep in and destroy the substrate which is holding the chrome plating in its place. that substrate which is usually copper acts like glue. now what happens when the glue is gone? ;)\n\nanother thing I probably forgot to mention that these specialty firearm cleaning fluids mostly contain industrial strength solvents that dissolve copper and carbon. these fluids are mostly known to be carcinogens, that is, they can cause cancer with prolonged use or body contact. now you decide which is a better cleaning method.\n\nmost common commercial firearm cleaning fluids contain ammonia and acetone or MEK. ammonia dissolves copper substrate whereas acetone is harmful to aluminum.\n\n[B]My preference: [/B]\n\n1. spray the barrel with ordinary brake cleaner a couple of times.\n2. run a few patches (cloth) through the barrel to remove any lose carbon fouling\n3. run a few more patches (tightly fit) to clean it as much as I can\n4a. Steel wool chucked into a variable speed drill OR\n4b. Automotive Compound Paste on a few patches chucked into a variable speed drill OR\n4c. Automotive Compound Paste on a few patches and some exercise going in and out. That sounds Naughty, right? ;)\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nVery Informative\n\nRegards', ''),

(483789, ' Optical centering comes from the natural centering of the cross hair either by the mirror or by using V shaped blocks to rest the scope upon. This way you will be able to center the reticle dead center and then place it on the rings with collimator in barrel to see where is the cross hair pointing. After that you can align the scope to the center WITHOUT using the turrets by just making small changes to the rings or the bases if you have a windage and elevation available in bases. This is mainly done to have an absolutely zeroed reticle at the time of installation.\r\nonce this is done.. some of the scopes allow to manually realign the turrets by removing the hex screws.. thus the scope will have centered scope aligned properly..\r\n\r\nlet me explain it by words from a peer:\r\n\r\nHowever, let us not forget that the key to accuracy is that the POA and POI coincide. Therefore, unless we have adjustable mounts, multiple offset ring inserts (like Burris Signature Rings), shims or other means of external adjustment to align the scope to the rifle, we are forced to use at least some of the internal adjustment range to align or “zero” the scope to the rifle. As a consequence the typical scope will not have its internal adjustments centered when “zeroed”.\r\n\r\nFor those fortunate or foresighted enough to have external means to adjust the “zero” of the scope to the rifle and use the internal adjustments only for small field condition corrections, it is very important that the internal adjustments are centered before “zeroing” via external means. There are at least three methods to accomplish the centering of the internal adjustments:\r\n\r\n1. Basic – Gently run the adjustment to one end of its range, count the clicks required to get to the other end of the range then back up half that number (repeat for the other adjustment). The principal advantage is that no other equipment is required but it is very difficult to do precisely particularly with scopes with large adjustment ranges and fine clicks.\r\n\r\n2. Mirror – Place a mirror (first surface mirror preferred) on the objective housing. View through the eyepiece will show the actual reticule and its reflection. Adjust both turrets until the actual cross hair covers its reflection. This method is very precise but does require either a bright outdoor setting or sufficient room light to be able to see the reticule reflection.\r\n\r\n3. V blocks – Place the scope on V blocks pointed at a white or gray card. While viewing through the eyepiece, rotate the scope. The junction of the crosshairs will orbit around the central axis. Adjust both turrets until the junction is on center and doesn’t move as the scope is rotated. Somewhat tedious but very precise and simple.', ''),

(483833, ' [QUOTE=atiq;321952]Optical centering comes from the natural centering of the cross hair either by the mirror or by using V shaped blocks to rest the scope upon. This way you will be able to center the reticle dead center and then place it on the rings with collimator in barrel to see where is the cross hair pointing. After that you can align the scope to the center WITHOUT using the turrets by just making small changes to the rings or the bases if you have a windage and elevation available in bases. This is mainly done to have an absolutely zeroed reticle at the time of installation.\nonce this is done.. some of the scopes allow to manually realign the turrets by removing the hex screws.. thus the scope will have centered scope aligned properly..\n\nlet me explain it by words from a peer:\n\nHowever, let us not forget that the key to accuracy is that the POA and POI coincide. Therefore, unless we have adjustable mounts, multiple offset ring inserts (like Burris Signature Rings), shims or other means of external adjustment to align the scope to the rifle, we are forced to use at least some of the internal adjustment range to align or “zero” the scope to the rifle. As a consequence the typical scope will not have its internal adjustments centered when “zeroed”.\n\nFor those fortunate or foresighted enough to have external means to adjust the “zero” of the scope to the rifle and use the internal adjustments only for small field condition corrections, it is very important that the internal adjustments are centered before “zeroing” via external means. There are at least three methods to accomplish the centering of the internal adjustments:\n\n1. Basic – Gently run the adjustment to one end of its range, count the clicks required to get to the other end of the range then back up half that number (repeat for the other adjustment). The principal advantage is that no other equipment is required but it is very difficult to do precisely particularly with scopes with large adjustment ranges and fine clicks.\n\n2. Mirror – Place a mirror (first surface mirror preferred) on the objective housing. View through the eyepiece will show the actual reticule and its reflection. Adjust both turrets until the actual cross hair covers its reflection. This method is very precise but does require either a bright outdoor setting or sufficient room light to be able to see the reticule reflection.\n\n3. V blocks – Place the scope on V blocks pointed at a white or gray card. While viewing through the eyepiece, rotate the scope. The junction of the crosshairs will orbit around the central axis. Adjust both turrets until the junction is on center and doesn’t move as the scope is rotated. Somewhat tedious but very precise and simple.[/QUOTE]\nVERY VERY THANKS ATIQ BHAI BUT STILL NOT UNDERSTAND ON V Block Can you translate it into URDU?

For that u have to tell them who u have to meet and why.. (U should know the name/designation/and office block as well as floor on which he is situated) U also need your original CNIC.\r\n\r\nThen u ned to go to the home department. Show your cNIC again at the gate. Find out where the Home sec sits and hten convince his PA u need a meeting with the big man. Once u get the meeting.. U can then try and convince him that U need a firearms license.\r\n\r\nUsually a copy of your job letter and visiting card as well as a reason for a weapon.. that is all that is necessary. If u do convince him of your need for a fire arm. He will then issue u a paper which u wil then need to take to the DIG operations.\r\n\r\nGo and meet the PA of the DIG and convince him that u need to visit the great man. And once U have a meeting with him then try and convince him that u need a fire arms lic. Once u have his approval get in touch with the Spacial branch i think it is also the DIG there and again the PA and the whole thing all over again.\r\n\r\nThen it wil be the DIG CIA and his PA. . However the CIA has issues with the home dep these days. So u need to convince him that u need his approval without telling him the Home Sec wants it..\r\n\r\nhow u do it is your responsibility. Then it wil be the SSP operations and his PA. all the way down to the SHO of your area. He will then send an ASI to your home to verify your antecedents. usually the ASI wil also need CNIC copies of your neighbours as character certificates. U will then need to convince the ASI to write a good character certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce he does write it then it is his responsibility to give it to teh SHO whose responsibility it is then to write a favourable report for the Sp who wil then write a favourable report for the SSP Ops. who will then send a favourable report to the DIG operations. How htey write these reports is not your responsibility u can try visiting them and asking them to do it but that is it.\r\n\r\nThe DIG ops will the send the report to the Home Sec. U may try and keep visiting the home sec to know if they have received the favourable reports.. Once they do so. U wlil then be asked to give the fees i.e Rs. 4500 and then u will have to submit your data personally i.e photo wil be taken finger prints and personal data such as how much u earn and where etc etc.\r\nU will then be issued a token and will then need to visit repeatedly to know when your lic wil be ready. Once it wlil be ready and u will take delivery then U wil buy the weapon and take it back to the home dep and they wil make an entry on it.\r\n\r\nlater U wil need to visit the Home sec. so that u can convince him that u need a 144 carry permit for at least 90 days. Meanwhile, U wil also need to take the lic to the national bank to get it registered there as well.\r\n\r\nThis sir is the procedure in case u want to do it on your own.\r\n\r\nAnd hanh. U need to be at least 25 years old to be eligible for teh Home dep lics. DC ones are closed these days till at least after muharram. \r\n\r\nYour only option in this age bracket is the DC one.', ''),

(484031, ' [QUOTE=fahadtanwri;322162]ohhhh are u talking abt adnan \n\nyes i got it\n\nsorry my mistake. i for got.:)[/QUOTE]\n\nOkay so I have followed this thread from the start and will offer you advice based on what I learnt from the newbie stage. Firstly bro, there is a reason references and details are mailed rather than displayed here openly on the forum. I hope you can spot the reasons. Secondly, the most important thing to do while getting the license made is to relax! Remember, dont push it or try to take shortcuts in this. Currently I am both weapon less and license less but I have learnt so much from involving my self on the forum and going around doing things the proper way. As it should be.\nThe dealer in question will charge you 15k - 17k. May be more because the powers that be decided some months ago that their coffers were light. And now I am very close to getting my license made and I will share my experience for your benefit.\n\n1) I am younger than 25 myself therefore opted for the DC license because the computerized ones require 25 years of age minimum. I went to the same dealer whose reference you were given and my license is still under process. Its been exactly three months to this date. No matter how smoothly the dealer may talk or how convincing his deadlines may sound, the license is a tough safe to crack and it will require alot of time. And every one hates waiting!\n\n2) For a DC license through a dealer, you will need (a) Advance cash (usually 3 - 4K) (b) CNIC photocopy (c) 3 passport sized pics. And then you will need both prayer and luck because not only you need a license, you need a valid license and the chances are that If youre amongst the law abiding, hard working citizens of Pakistan without Pawa, its gonna take you time.\n\n3) Forget about shortcuts and any other piece of advice. The Few pointers that ED wrote in the start of this thread should be your "Ten commandments" nothing else. The dealers will offer you false information. For the sake of ease since youre a newbie, dont take advice from dealers. They want your money and they will do everything to get it!\n\n4) Get your character certificate made by your local PS and do it yourself with all proper steps. You will need, (a) Two utility bills, KESC and SSGC my case, (b) 4 passport sized pics, (c) Two CNICs from your nieghbourhood (note these people should not be relatives - I learnt it the hard way. And give this to the dealers as they tend to avoid this step!\n\n5) Photocopy all documents you come across and submit. As a thumb rule!\n\n6) While youre waiting, make friends on the forum and ask them to take you out on shooting trips. Check websites and read reviews on youtube. Trust me, It will help you pass time and will assist you in avoiding the temptation of short cuts.\n\nWho knows, with time you might find someone who has some friends in the DC office and will help you getting the license made!', ''),

Whereas, Glocks have the same trigger pull... All one needs to understand is that, Glocks are designed for trained and specially very cautious people... But I would also admit that when it comes to "pull your gun out and shoot", Glock is the fastest...!!![/QUOTE]\nActually glock is favorite pistol of LEAs, meet any SSG person ask about his fav pistol, answer would be glock. It can be carried chambered if its hard fiber holster is used, and that can be used only when u dont have to carry it concealed.', ''),

The back dated licenses are those licences against which the quota was approved but the challan fees was not submitted or the license was converted from pistol to shotgun or  shotgun to pistol.  \n\nE.g Mr. karachite after being mugged decides to carry a firearm. Was fortunate enough to find the DC in a jolly mood one and day and somehow convinces him for a license. The DC approves and assigns quota number 38 for the month of November 2009 to Mr. Karachite. He like a good citizen follows all the steps and by chance gets killed in a gunfight by a bullet that wasnt intended for him. Now his quota for the license is a orphan without a home!\n\nNow Mr. GunsandBullets a reputed dealer with connections in the DC gets someone to find out all such orphaned licences and sells them to enthusiastic chaps like Mr. Gulshan who get books dated November 2009 on the quota for that year.\n\nMr. Gunsandbullets, to avoid discrepancies, writes the date of the purchase of weapon for the year 2009 too in his books so that he doesnt get caught.

If TT''s recoil does not bother you, you need not to worry about 9mm. It has the most tamed recoil.\n\n2.

Honestly speaking, I have never heard of such jamming issues. As far as price is concerned, even 95K with kit is on higher side. Caracal F is available in Lahore for 65K and kit for 20K.

I never recommend a shotgun for self defense. its just too cumbersome and can never compete with a handgun/revolver for this kind of an assignment. however Home Defense is where a shotgun truly outshines any other kind of a firearm and in HD, my preference is always a pump action over a semi auto because:\r\n\r\n1. P/A are virtually maintenance free.\r\n2. P/A actions are extremely simple to "not get it right" the first time.\r\n3. P/A are virtually malfunction free. simple devices.\r\n4. P/A are easy to operate (with a little bit of practice ofcourse). there are not many controls that need to be mastered.\r\n\r\nin short there is no simple answer as to why one should go for a P/A over S/A (Semi Auto). no such thing as right or wrong here. the debate is quiet similar to a Semi auto Handgun vs a Revolver. where one platform offers higher rate of fire whereas the other platform offers simplicity in design and operation.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(484439, 'DIY - Full Bedding A Rifle Stock [SIZE=4]Rifle bedding[/SIZE] (also known as glass or epoxy bedding) is the process of filling gaps between the action and the stock of a rifle with an epoxy based material. The bedding creates a stable and precise fit for the contact surfaces. Bedding is a technique employed in accurizing a rifle and to a lesser extent prolonging the life of the stock.\n\n[SIZE=4][U]Primary Purpose[/U][/SIZE]\n\n\n[B][SIZE=3]Increased Accuracy[/SIZE][/B]\nBedding increases accuracy in part by relieving stress on the action. The rifle''s action will rarely sit flush in the stock without bedding. This causes the action to flex when tightening the bolts holding the action to the stock. The flexing results in a loss of accuracy. Bedding will create a flush surface for the action and prevent flexing. Bedding also reduces movement of the action in the stock. Without bedding, the action may be more likely to shift after a shot. If the action shifts and does not return to same spot in the stock the rifle will lose the ability to maintain zero.\n\n[B][SIZE=3]Prolonged Stock Life[/SIZE][/B]\nBedding can help prolong the life of the stock. Repeated recoil forces can cause movement of the action in the stock. As the action moves, friction can create wear in the stock surface. Eventually the repeated wear can ruin the stock.\n\n[B][SIZE=3]Methods of Bedding[/SIZE][/B]\n\nSeveral different methods of bedding can be used depending on the type of stock, desired results and level of experience of the person attempting to perform the bedding.\nMethods include:\n[B][I]1.  Full contact bedding of the action with the barrel floated.[/I][/B]\n2.  Full contact bedding of the action and the barrel.\n3.  Full contact bedding of the action with a pressure-bearing pad for the barrel.\n4.  Pillar bedding of the action with the barrel floated.\n5.  Full length aluminum action bedding block.\n\nFull contact bedding of the action with the barrel floated is a very common method for long range rifles with a heavy barrel. A free-floating barrel will generally produce the greatest accuracy. However, a pressure pad under the barrel just forward of the action can sometimes improve accuracy by acting on barrel harmonics and reducing stress on the action from the weight of the barrel. Pillar bedding can be used to float the action as well as the barrel, but the process is more difficult.\n \n[SIZE=1][B]Credits: [URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle_bedding[/URL]\n\n\n[/B]I have chosen the 1st option to follow.\n\nHaving shot about 50 bullets since I bought it a while back, I felt a dire need to bed the action of this Armscor .22 WMR rifle. It holds the action to the stock with one screw and stock-to-action chiseling has some visible gaps, specially inner contact areas.\n\n[/SIZE]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14906[/ATTACH]\n\n[B][SIZE=3]Step 1:[/SIZE][/B] Scrubbed / mildly sanded the polished & oil enriched areas that go into contact with the action directly.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14907[/ATTACH]\n\n\nThis is how it came out. It is supposed to remove polish only & not the wood, leaving a rough surface good for adhesion.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14908[/ATTACH]\n\nAs the fore-end also needed to be bedded to avoid or minimize swelling that may effect a floating barrel in rainy / humid weather, same process was applied there as well.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14909[/ATTACH]\n\nThis was to avoid sandpaper rubbing the outer edges and damaging polish.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14910[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14911[/ATTACH]\n\n\n[SIZE=3][B]Step 2: [/B][/SIZE]The stock needed to be taped to protect from damages, spillover & easy cleaning afterwards.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14912[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14913[/ATTACH]\n\nThe barrel needed to have atleast three layers of tape to create a thickness enough to leave a gap between bedded epoxy & barrel to make it float.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14914[/ATTACH]', ''),
(484440, ' Greased a thin but uniform layer on the areas that are intended to touch the epoxy.

What i did was mix about 1.5 pack of our commonly available Magic Epoxy (quick settling) and applied about 2 mm thick layer in the action area and about 1 mm thick layer in barrel area of the stock. Placed the action into place & screwed it tight enough to be in place perfectly leaving about last one or two turns. That will provide the pressed grip while final torquing.\n[/COLOR]\nThe overflow of surplus epoxy.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14918[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]14919[/ATTACH]\n\nGave it about 30 minutes till the epoxy felt hard enough not to come off or lose shape.

You people must be aware that a data bank with SBP has been established which just reveals all bank accounts of a person with just one click after entering CNIC number.\n\nThe same policy can be applied to weapon holders as well. CNIC should be primary id number for every thing.', ''),

(484608, ' Here, I can share my story. in 2007, my father wished to buy a pump action. He surveyed and then asked me and my elder brother to go along with him to purchase. This was my first interaction with Farhan as a shop owner. My father put the license before him and get the gun (Mossberg, Maverick) out of box. My elder brother just get the money out of his pocket and put on the desk. Meanwhile, My father handed over the gun to me for review. I just pulled the pump. A sober man was sitting there, he asked me that please donot pump while the gun is not loaded. I replied, "pumping a gun should not be a problem as it is necessary to review the gun". Suddenly, Farhan invaded (at that time, he was registering the gun on our license) that the guy was saying right. I replied very politely that now gun was ours and we could do whatever we wished to do and I did not want to do a discussion on it. He said that I insulted his friend, you knew who was he. I replied, I did not know his friend and I did not do any offense. He just got flared up and tried to bully me. I was loaded with pistol at that time and my father knew this thing. My pop pushed me out of his shop. Then I  asked my elder brother that what ever the situation we would not buy the gun from him. Then my pop refused him to buy the gun and got cancellation of purchase on the license. We bought the gun from Walcon Arms. \nI know Farhan from the time when he was an employee on Maukal Arms. This is the rule in vendors'' community that customer is always boss. I dont know what he is selling but he is v.poor in "Respect Buying". \nWhen ever we visit a shop, we never be a friend, we are just purchasers. \n\nNow a days, I am in USA and I can evaluate that what kind of respect and protocol, a customer deserves!\n\nJust to fortify my explaination, I wish to introduce myself that in 2007 I was a PhD fellow and Now I am an Assistant Professor.', ''),

(484615, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;322547]Bro, you are absolutely right however kindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject. I never recommend a shotgun for self defense. its just too cumbersome and can never compete with a handgun/revolver for this kind of an assignment. however Home Defense is where a shotgun truly outshines any other kind of a firearm and in HD, my preference is always a pump action over a semi auto because:  1. P/A are virtually maintenance free. 2. P/A actions are extremely simple to "not get it right" the first time. 3. P/A are virtually malfunction free. simple devices. 4. P/A are easy to operate (with a little bit of practice ofcourse). there are not many controls that need to be mastered.  in short there is no simple answer as to why one should go for a P/A over S/A (Semi Auto). no such thing as right or wrong here. the debate is quiet similar to a Semi auto Handgun vs a Revolver. where one platform offers higher rate of fire whereas the other platform offers simplicity in design and operation.

(485082, ' No only 3 weapons available here  that have rotary berrels. The CF 98/NP42 the stoeger cougar and Berreta Storm\n\n"Self-loading automatic pistols can be divided into "blowback" and "locked breech" categories according to their principle of operation. The blowback operating principle is suitable for smaller, low-powered calibres, such as 7.65mm Browning (also known as .32 ACP), and 9mm Browning Short (also known as .380 ACP) as the resistance of the recoil spring and mass of the slide are sufficient to retard the opening of the breech until the projectile has left the barrel, and breech pressure has dropped to a safe level. For more powerful calibres such as the 9mm Parabellum (9mmP) and .45 ACP, some form of locked breech is needed to retard breech opening, as an unlocked blowback pistol in these calibres requires a very heavy slide and stiff spring, making them bulky, heavy and difficult to operate." \n\nWikipedia \n\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_pistol[/url]\n\nThe rotary barrel system actually rotates the barrel which is supposed to lead to decreased muzzle flip.

I have shot nice groups at 25 meters.  These are truly James Bond Guns.  Their ammo has always been an issue here in Pakistan.  About ten years ago, in DAK, the Walther PPKs could be had for about 3300/rs - 5000/rs.  Yes, that price is right.  The were all converted from .380 acp to .32 bore.  OEM .32 bore Walthers can be had here but NIBs are now commanding about 100000/rs by some shop owners.

(485133, ' [QUOTE=Mig;321681]Then what could be the problem ??[/QUOTE]\n\nIt "could" be the problem as I explained above.\n\nI have done similar mistake due to vague knowledge of firearms at early age. During cleaning process I broke the string and glob of oily rags got stuck about 6 inches from muzzle end. I just picked up a shell and shot it. I was lucky that rag being far away from shell, gas had some room to expand and was able to push pallets towards the end and push rags out before reaching to dangerous pressure in a very short time. \n\nIf rag ball was within an inch of shell, I would have been in big trouble. Now I know that, but at that time I didn''t.\n\nSo, moral of the story is "NO RESTRICTION IN THE BARREL WHATSOEVER".', ''),
