Infact I think that''s nonsense, it''s all about the design of the gun. Some guns are better suited for polymer frames like Glocks for example. The Rami P although not a bad gun turns into a fantastic gun in the Steel/Alloy frame while in Polymer it''s just average. Also CZ gave the P another disadvantage by giving the D Trijicon sights and P regular ones.  \n\nI''ve had both guns for a year and carry the Duty every day and the Rami perhaps a dozen times. It all comes down to your preference. I took some pictures just now to show and tell you why.\n\nHere are both the guns next to each other. The Duty a compact and the Rami a sub compact. I have a Houge on the Duty in this picture.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4934[/ATTACH]\nNext up, notice the Grip width. The Rami with it''s Rubber grips is about half a cm thicker than the Duty.\n\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]4935[/ATTACH]This is the Rami with 14 shot magazine. Isn''t it strange that the Rami grip length is more than the Duty. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4936[/ATTACH]\nThe Rami and the Duty placed side by side to make length comparison easy for you guys. The Duty is about 2 cm longer. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4937[/ATTACH]\n\nFrom the pictures above it should be clear that the Rami ceases to be a sub compact with the 14 shot magazine and is almost into compact territory. Barrel length is not the sole consideration for being a sub compact, frame width, low sights, low weight is very important for a gun that is meant to be primarily carried concealed. \n\nI prefer the Duty to carry over the Rami because:\n\n1). The Duty fits my hand better.\n2). The Duty is as easily carried as the Rami.\n3). The Duty offers me two more rounds for slightly lesser mag size (16 vs 14).\n4). The Duty has a better balance because of the longer frame/barrel.\n5). The Duty has a better trigger. (Rami''s is good, Omega is excellent).\n6). The Duty has a Safety and an option to install a Decocker if I need one. The Rami comes with a decocker. I prefer safeties.\n7). The Duty is easier to shoot on Range days at distances beyond 20m.\n8). The Duty has a much better trigger guard for support hand adding to gun balance.\n9). The Duty has rails for mounting a light or a laser.\n10). The Duty has Ambidextrous controls (i.e the Safety/Decocker is on both sides of the gun)\n\nI have both and really love the little Rami because it is a gun that over delivers on your expectation for a subcompact, to do that though it''s ended up somewhere in between a compact and a sub compact.', 1, 0, '117.102.35.138', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You can easily achieve 1 inch groups at 40 yards, effective range for pigeons and rabbits is up to 100 yards and recoil is very manageable. Once the rifle is broken in, accuracy is further aided and loudness also decreases to some extent. It is a springer which is an ''air cannon'' and able to take down coyotes, jackals, porcupines, etc in one shot. I myself have shot a large baby wild boar with mine. About scopes, Diana 4-16X42AO and Diana 6-24X42 AO scopes work perfectly alright on this gun and stay zeroed if you use a single-piece lock-down mount. Other scopes which are effective on this gun are Bushnell, Leopold, etc RECOIL AND SHOCK PROOF SCOPES. And if one wants a cheaper method than scopes, he can buy peep sights, just like open sights, very very accurate (about as much as a 4Xmagnification scope).', 1, 1, '119.73.6.189', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It was strange to read a post such as the one below from someone such as yourself. \n\nThere was perhaps some miscommunication, this forum is not Punjab, KPK or any other province specific nor does it follow the hunting or firearms rules of any of province. We have our own set of rules and are clear about what is allowed and what is not. For example automatic weapons in Pakistan are allowed for those who have licenses for them, however our forum rules don''t allow them so don''t discuss them. Similarly bolt action rifles were prohibited in Punjab but allowed in Sindh. Regardless of what the provincial policy in Punjab was we allowed them from the very beginning. This is one thing our hunter brothers fail to understand, we don''t care what the hunting rules are in Punjab, KPK, Sind or Baluchistan, we have our own and act accordingly. \n\nIt is useless to start arguing with a moderator about "why" a rule is what it is. He is just responsible for enforcing it.   \n\nAnyway, your ban was temporary from whichever mod was present at the forum when your post was made. It will be lifted in 72 hours. If you wish to keep on participating at the forum, I look forward to your posts.

Excellent.\nYour shots are generally an inch or or 2 to the lower of the POA.

Further efficiency of the laser would be  clear, if you do a group of 5 consecutive shots in rapid. Just shoot again as soon as you find the beam back on the bull, would be pretty interesting to see that sequence.\nAlso, kindly share your stance with these shots, were you still aiming naturally, means, checking the beam through the iron sights, or was it purely[I] point shooting [/I]?

Airsoft guns are very similar to real guns used by these personnel, and in many cases, the size ratio and even weight ratio is 1:1. Also the devices function very closely to how real guns operate.\n\nOne of the main reasons airsoft guns are so attractive in militaristic simulations is, besides the realism, the simple fact that you can actually use them to fight. All you can do with a real gun is target shoot or at most fire blanks but nothing that comes close to real. Personnel can actually engage in realistic military operations with airsoft guns, and perform maneuvers that they may well do in actual combat. The training is very efficient because of the size and weight ratios and the fact that with the use of the appropriate airsoft guns, the training feels like a real battle.\n\nHope this makes the concept of airsoft guns clearer to you.', 1, 1, '119.152.93.85', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

My grandma use to apply lemon,vinigar,garlic crush etc, for the big game meat. Flour (ATTA) is a new recipe. This is normally used on low dense fish meat after lemon application to absorb its water. Since duck meat is very thick, dry and high dense it does not release the water contents so easily.\nIn Japan i have seen the traditional duck cooking where they use smoke of wood fire on the raw duck meat to eliminate its smell. Somewhat similar method is also applied in Pakistan which is locally  called "Luu Kai Pakana". In this process removes the feathers of the duck while leaving the skin and feather filaments intact. Clean the duck thoroughly and burn the feather filaments with wood fire until the skin becomes brownish. Now remove the chest bone and cut the duck into pieces. Tender these pieces in Garlic paste, Oil, Little yogurt, a small cube of cheese, salt, pepper and spices according to the taste. (No onion ). Once it properly cooked remove the skin while eating and enjoy a great taste of duck.\nHowever I enjoyed Steak of my hunting birds and animals. Marinade the completely clean and washed 1/2 kg meat with 2 table spoon of oil, 2 table spoon of water. 1 table spoon of red wine vinegar and 2 table spoon of Steak seasoning. Put marinade meat in refrigerator for 1 hour. Discard marinade. You may grill the stuff or wrap a foil paper and put it in oven for 30 minutes. Try it and enjoy.

I figured of all my forums that I subscribe to, this is the one that has the best chance of having someone who can read Arabic, so here it is.\n\nOne of the UN conditions that the former-Yugoslavian countries (Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia) signed up for in their peace agreements was that they would disarm their militias and paramilitaries, and reduce the number of weapons in their national armories.  These weapons were stored for awhile, and now they are being destroyed by cutting the receiver in half.  The parts from these destroyed guns go onto the world market, many of which come to the USA.  \n\nSome of these parts have been modified and personalized by individuals who used them.  I assume this was probably done by militia/paramilitaries and civilians, as it is hard to imagine the officers of a regular military force permitting this.   In any case, it was very common to carve the buttstocks and grips in ways ranging from crude graffiti to elaborate national crests and slogans or nice portraits of wives and girlfriends, etc.  Pretty much whatever a bored soldier without good supervision would want to do.\n\nSo here is what I have, presumably made by a Muslim militiaman fighting for Bosnia (either a native Bosnian or foreign volunteer).

I have heard of the .30 bore (7.62x25mm) rounds achieve between 1300 -1450 fps but with a 85 grain bullet. The .357 magnum round (7.62x33mm) has almost the same diameter as the .30 bore bullet, but has a longer cartridge (more powder) behind it resulting it far higher velocities from heavier bullets. For example the .357 mag bullet having 158grain bullet achieves 1485 fps. Hence the .357 can weigh almost twice as much and still have the same velocity as  the TT bullet, which should impact considerably more damage to the target.\n\nI am learning new things everyday and would appreciate the reference? thanks[/QUOTE] Defining power of a cartridge is very difficult. Some judge by the  bullets diameter, others bullet  velocity,still others by  energy derived for bullet diameter  and velocity factors combined. For myself, I have compromised on all these factors. I use the 9mm, not because it is the most powerful, but because it has sufficent bullet diameter, velocity, and energy to stop an opponent with muliple hits.I chose it  because I wish to reduce the chance of killing an innocent bystander, reduce the change of over penetration(and again killing an innocent),and because hanguns are available in sizes ease to conceal.I will close the a quote from and older wise man."The only use for a handgun is to fight your way to a rifle"', 1, 0, '173.217.103.147', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

An excellent  compendium of various handgun caliber bullets'' performances. For example a  9mm luger delivers more energy when fired from a 3 inch barrel than a .38 special bullet out of a 2inch snubbie (so a CZ RAMI with its 3 inch barrel may be a more effective man stopper with less recoil, more shots and less muzzle blast than with a 2 inch  barreled S&W J frame revolver firing .38 special cartridges/bullets) ).  This also shows that using a .357 magnum in a 2inch revolver may deliver as much punch as when using a 9mm luger from a 3-4 inch barrel [but with the 9mm luger you also get a lot more control-ability and more shots].  .357 magnums start shining when fired from 3inch+ barrels. I certainly learnt a lot from this and MAY be switching from my .357 mag snubbie to a CZ RAMI as a backup handgun. Hope you all enjoy it as much as i did.

I would have thought the muzzle energy is equal or perhaps slight higher for heavier grains and not less as is shown in the graph (since energy is a measure of force that is independent of weight).[/QUOTE]\n\n@ Alisyed: Bro, a very valid and interesting observation which i shall answer in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1: Muzzle energy is actually the Kinetic energy of the bullet as calculated right when the bullet exits the muzzle. Kinetic energy: E=Mass x velocity x velocity. \nSo muzzle energy  calculations DO  take into account   the mass of the bullet and its velocity.  Since we are measuring energy in ft - pounds the formula is as under:\n\n[TABLE="width: 700"]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]         [CENTER][B]muzzle energy:[/B]\n[/CENTER]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         [CENTER][B][U]Velocity * Velocity (ft/sec) * Bullet Mass (grains)[/U] =           ft. lbs.\n 450,240 [/B]                    \n                       \n        (velocity in feet per second, weight in grains.)\n\nThe number 450,240 is a constant needed to convert the units. If someone is curious as to why this number is used, i have put in the calculation at the bottom. We are using grains and velocity in ft/sec as these figures are easier to come by. We are using pounds since the cited graphs have their energies measured in ft-pounds.\n[/CENTER]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (Velocity squared. I can''t figure out how to put up a ''squared'' in here so i put in velocity  * velocity )\n\nPlease[FONT=Arial] note that it is obvious from the above formula that in developing muzzle energy, muzzle velocity is much more important than projectile weight. Doubling the muzzle velocity of a  projectile quadruples its energy, whereas doubling the projectile weight only doubles its energy.[/FONT] If the  mass of the bullet being shot is increased and its velocity is not kept the same or is decreased there will a bigger drop in the muzzle energy in proportion to the drop in velocity. \n\nIdeally, if when the bullet mass increases and the velocity could be kept constant or the velocity drop is kept at a minimum, it would result in far more muzzle energy delivered by the bullet compared to that delivered by  a lighter bullet with the same velocity.\n\nExample:  \n a .357 magnum bullet of 125 grains mass and achieving a muzzle velocity of 1000 ft/s from a 2 inch barrel  would generate around 277 ft.pound of muzzle energy\n[B][U]1000 * 1000 * 125[/U]  = 277.62        ft. lbs.\n 450,240 [/B]                    \n\na .357 magnum bullet of 158 grains mass and achieving a muzzle velocity  of 1000 ft/s from a 2 inch barrel  would generate around 350 ft.pound of  muzzle energy\n[B][U]1000 * 1000 * 158[/U]  =   350.92        ft. lbs.\n 450,240 [/B]                    \n\nIn this case the heavier bullet DOES impart phenomenally more muzzle energy than its lighter counterpart (velocity remained constant) and your observation holds completely true.\n\n\nPart 2: How to explain the phenomenon that you noticed wherein  a heavier bullet in 9mm luger is showing considerably less muzzle energy than a lighter bullet (example Corbon 90 grain  JHP +P  vs Federal  135 gr Hydra Shok JHP Low recoil).\n\nThe answer lies in their muzzle velocities. The 90 grain bullet is rated +P which means that bullet''s  cartridge is loaded HOTTER to achieve higher velocities than normal for the bullet. Fired from a 2 inch barrel it achieved a velocity of 1215 ft/sec.  The  135 gr Bullet is marked "LOW RECOIL" indicating that it is loaded for lower recoil and hence would achieve lesser velocities (since the mass of the bullet is fixed and is larger than the 90 grain bullet, it would mean that the powder used was of such quality or quantity that it imparts lower velocity to the bullet- hence lower recoil felt by the shooter). This bullet achieves a velocity of 909 ft/second only. Difference in velocities= 306 ft/sec. ( the 90 grain bullet is faster by 33% than the 135 grain bullet).\n\nThe large difference in velocities of these two rounds tilt the scale of muzzle energy in favour of the  the lighter bullet, as reflected in the graph for 9mm below.\n\nHowever, when you compare the Corbon 115 grain +P, the muzzle energy delivered is far higher than those delivered by the the 90 grain +p bullet. \n\nThis is because the 115 grain +P bullet (being ALSO loaded hot) achieves a velocity of 1134 ft/second. Now the difference in velocities is  narrower between the two bullets (1215-1134= 81 ft/second) but it is enough to give the heavier bullet a slightly more muzzle velocity (The difference in mass between the two bullets is far more than the difference in velocities .  The 115 grain bullet is 27.7% heavier than the 90 grain bullet but the 90 grain bullet is only 7% faster than the heavier 115 gr bullet). \n\nIf you look at the graph for the 9mm luger closely you would see that in fact all heavier bullets that are rated ''+P'' (faster) achieve a higher muzzle energy for their given weight when compared to their ''non +P'' rated (slower) equal weighing counterparts. The +P rated heavier bullets are delivering more muzzle energy than slightly faster but lighter bullets as the mass gain in all of them are much higher and the loss in velocities is quite low. \n\nI hope this issue is a little bit more clear. \n\nBut please do bear in mind that calculation of muzzle energies is just ONE variable in measuring the bullet''s effectiveness in self defence situations and the bullet''s performance/effectiveness also largely depends on its structure/shape, its effectiveness at expansion, its ability not to break up or not to break up prematurely, and on its ability to  achieve consistent deep enough penetration to reach and damage vital organs.\n\nNotes: Part 1: velocities of bullets used in Part 1 are hypothetical for  use as an illustration\n          Part 2 : Velocities of 9mm luger stated are actual recorded and correspond to the graph below.\n\n (Source for velocities : BBTI    [URL]http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/9mmluger.html[/URL])\n\nThat constant  number 450240 is a constant created by  multiplying two times the acceleration of gravity by 7,000 - the number  of grains in a pound. The number I am using for the acceleration of  gravity is 32.16 f.p.s.

Airsoft guns are very similar to real guns used by these personnel, and in many cases, the size ratio and even weight ratio is 1:1. Also the devices function very closely to how real guns operate.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons airsoft guns are so attractive in militaristic simulations is, besides the realism, the simple fact that you can actually use them to fight. All you can do with a real gun is target shoot or at most fire blanks but nothing that comes close to real. Personnel can actually engage in realistic military operations with airsoft guns, and perform maneuvers that they may well do in actual combat. The training is very efficient because of the size and weight ratios and the fact that with the use of the appropriate airsoft guns, the training feels like a real battle.\r\n\r\nHope this makes the concept of airsoft guns clearer to you.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThank you very much for this detailed explanation. :)\r\nI have one more question, Can Airsoft Gun be used in Bird hunting ???', 1, 0, '203.128.27.14', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is a FREE of COST platform for Hunters all over Pakistan and the world to gather to share their stories, pictures and experiences.\n\n We here at PakGuns have provided unparalleled freedom of discussion with easy to follow rules and polite and mild warnings in case of offenses. However some friends have started to think of this facility as a [B]Right [/B]by arguing with moderators, posting content which is against our rules, trying to bend the rules and thinking themselves VIP''s. Moderators start receiving calls, SMS''s and emails soon after a post or a thread which is deemed inappropriate is deleted. I find this behavior very strange, this is an online forum and concerns should be shared via email not by calling people''s personal/work phones. Also not everything everyone shares or posts is something which we would want to keep on fourms. If moderators delete any post or content then that is solely their choice and decision and I stand by it [B]100 %[/B]. No one has the right to question them except Admin.\n\nThe Hunting forum and PakGuns in general is a [B]Privilege [/B]that we provide without any compensation or expectations of return as a goodwill gesture to our Pakistani brothers. We run it the way we deem appropriate, this forum is not a democracy nor do we vote on who gets to be a moderator or not. Admin chooses the best person for the job and then supports and stands by his actions. If Admin over the long run thinks a moderator is not upto the job then it is a matter of personal discussion between the Mod and Admin who are often close friends. I was surprised to learn that people from the Hunting section were calling moderators over the phone and asking for explanations as to why their threads/posts/content were deleted. \n\nAlso to our amusement, two members would both have a quibble in the forums, both would report each other posts saying mean things about the other and demanding that he be banned. If a moderator thought someone was at fault and banned one of them, the other would start asking in the open forum as to why the other was banned and he should be unbanned and brought back to the forum. This reminds me of a John Travolta / Nicolas Cage movie but translated into Urdu the word would be ''Munafkat''. \n\nIn short, some friends from this section have caused us more headaches in a month then the entire forum put together in 6 months. We are strongly considering closing the Hunting section altogether and withdrawing this free platform we provide to hunters.

Most mid-high end Air-soft weapons are carefully crafted replicas of the original gun. Like paintball they have a significant potential for fun game play which a little more added realism. So when i heard of air-soft guns being imported , it got be excited, and i ended up buying a G36c Asia electric AEG ( automatic electric gun ).\r\n\r\nFirst Impression :\r\nHaving never held a proper G36c i cant comment on how realistic the feel may or may not be , but the textured abs plastic body is very impressive, compared to the polymer frames of some handguns my family owns. The only thing I''m not a huge fan of is the very ''plastic'' grip.It came with the manual which is pretty much just like Tokyo Marui''s. It even talks about the TM tracer unit. Also included is an 8.4v battery, more on that later a trickle type wall charger, cleaning rod, magazine, and the gun.\r\nStarting with the back of the gun , A decent strength butt-stock, Foldable with a removable rubber butt plate. \r\nThe following are all metal on the G36C: Front sling post, hand guard rail, flash hider, hop-up cover, trigger, selector switch, front and rear sights, all the body and stock pins, and the gearbox. The gun is flat black but when held up to the light it has an amber-ish glow. Metal rear sight, adjustable, and two sights for cqb/field targets. Ambidextrous selector switch. After reaching home i popped bb''s into the mag, and stepped outside,then quickly took aim at my favorite target and let off a quick burst. The rounds took flight and went straight into orbit. After adjusting the hop-up, which is stiff at first, I was consistently hitting a 3 foot tall tree stump at 150 feet. Not bad for a gun that is only 28 and a quarter inches long.\r\n\r\nManual:\r\nThe manual actually surprised me. It didn''t have many spelling mistakes and was easy to read, almost no engrish. It had a lot of diagrams for the breakdown of the gun, cleaning the barrel, even trouble shooting. A good manual is a plus in my book.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\nThis thing shoots quite far, I am consistently hitting a tree trunk from 150 feet. I did a poor mans chrono test with a Diet Coke (with Lime) and it went straight through both sides. I also shot the bottom and it pierced it (didn''t go in). But that is quite impressive. \r\n\r\nInternals:\r\nI haven''t cracked open the gearbox mainly because I just got it and I wont jack with it till it breaks or I want to upgrade it. The hop-up is very responsive and is adjusted via the G36 dial.\r\nJudging by the sound of the gun, there isn''t any gear grind or weird sounds so I think this thing will last, time will tell. I haven''t had any semi auto lock ups, where you have to switch into auto to be able to fire.The battery that comes with the gun is very nice and fits solidly into the hand guard.\r\n\r\nDurability:\r\nCant say yet, but trust me this gun is going to have the crap beat out of it and we''ll see how long it lasts. Judging by how smooth the GB is running I think it will last, but only time will tell. I have shot about 1500 rounds through this gun, with not 1 miss-feed, jam, or lock up. Its done its job so far, not only internally, but externally as well.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nIn the limited time I''ve owned this gun , it''s managed to bring a smile to my face each time . Watching a cardboard box getting shred to pieces on full auto is just plainly put ....Satisfying :P  \r\nAir-soft guns aren''t meant to be compared to Airguns, their primary application is for fun and sport\r\nI would like to thank Imran bhai for being a super host/salesperson/tech-help all rolled in one .\r\nThis is airsoft !

Please moderate them under the following rules:\n\n1). If you find an inappropriate post, copy it here and delete it. The post made after deletion is "[B]Thread Cleaned of inappropriate/off topic posts[/B]". [U]Under no circumstances should any other comment be made[/U]. If anyone asks what happened to their post without any comment just post a link to this thread: ( [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?7457-New-Hunting-Section-Rules.-Please-follow-to-avoid-Inconvenience.&p=222704#post222704[/url] )\n\n2). [B]Moderators should avoid posting comments in the Hunting threads[/B]. If you appreciate them they will think you are their best buddy and they can get away with stuff, if you object to them they will start to think they are being victimized. \n\n3). [B]Completely Avoid communication with Hunters over the phone/sms[/B] or in person except GTG''s. They can never be friends with Mods.\n\n4). [B]Warnings are sent over email only[/B] to Hunters and not in the main forum. Any warning in the main forum is like a head shot to their ego''s. \n\n5). [B]Never, ever, Never NEVER get personal[/B] with Hunters or ask them about laws and regulations and to explain their viewpoint. They will always tell you an interpretation of the law with suits them. It is pointless arguing. Any warning should be [B]soft[/B], [B]professional [/B]and [B]business [/B]like. \n\n6). If someone is rude to you, do not get angry, the man responsible is not worth spoiling your mood over. If the rude comment is mild then you can ignore it by deleting his post and pretending you never read it. If he misbehaves again ban him for 72 hours with the ban message being "Account Disabled for 72 hours, please be polite". \n\n[B]An example of how I like to tackle rude behavior can be seen from an email I just got and replied to: [/B]\n\nQuoting Sajjad Khan <snowleopard_pk@yahoo.com>:\n\n[I]Dear sir,,,\n[/I][I] Your words are quite straight forward and self explanatory,,,,\ni or any other member can never nor should challenge the powers awarded  to the Mods by you as you are the CHIEF and ADMIN,,,, BUT,,,, BUT,,,  BUT,,,,\nMy Very Dear and Respected sir,,, you are not understanding my point or  rather not trying to understand ..... that the only rule at hunting  forum is NOT TO SHARE OR DISCUSS ILLEGAL HUNTS,,,,,\n\nI in my previous mail explained the whole scenario,,, that we shared  some legal hunts which were deleted, and someone else shares an illegal  hunt and his posts are still there? if you cant address this issue and  resolve it , then please kindly don''t call us "Munafiq" in your recently  started thread,,,, as it proves yourself "Munafiq" by supporting the  illegal hunters at your forum and  this is the bias and partisan  behavior on which we are complaining and you are not  listening,,,,,,,,,,,,one thing more we never called your Mod for banning  any body it was him who contacted via email and requested for our cell  no.s and discussed the DOVE HUNTING ISSUES,,,,\n\nin addition a very  recent "GOOD WORK" by your Mod  is that a member  named "Affan khan" started a thread in which he is sharing the hunt of  partridges,,,,, Dear sir Partridge hunting season is not still on in any  part of the country till now,, the guy is sharing an illegal hunt and  your Mod is praising him on this hunt on his post #07,,,,,,,,,,,\nThis simple and recent example is enough to support my words,,,,,,,,, on  the other hand you are one and only CHIEF whatever you do i have no  concern with that,,,,, i can only wish a good future to PG as i was a  sincere part of it for some time and learn t some very precious things ,  which will help in my coming part of life,,,,,,\ntake care\nsajjad khan\n[/I]\n\nReply:\n\nDear Brother,\n \n Thank you for your concern and the in depth explanation.

I want to share some of the draw backs of Diana 54 airking.  Its a costly gun and I feel that all should know the negative points of this gun before going into purchase it.  \n\nPlease note that I mention these points with complete confidence and surety.\n\n1.  Its heavy for some one who wants to shoot it from standing position.\n\n2.  Its very accurate but to find all the potential accuracy you would have to scope it.  And this is the most difficult thing to do. This gun is hardest on scopes.  Even most of the airgun rated scopes do not last long on it. Many Leupolds fail.  It is recoil less to the shooter but has the heaviest recoil on scope.\n\n3.  The recoil on scope is even greater than Webley Patriot.\n\n4.  Even costly scopes fail after a few hundred or few thousand shots.\n\n5.  This gun and 48/52/56TH have the shortest spring lives among all Diana airguns.  The average spring life is 4000 shots.  Some last for just 1000 and some last for 7000 thousand.  So when you buy this gun, be ready to acquire an extra spring.\n\n6.  The best accuracy with this gun is in bench rest position. When you take a sharp angle, you would have to adjust the power of recoil less system.\n\n7.  There is a sleeve of metal on the barrel. This sleeve needs to be kept tight. But some times it becomes loose which creates problem with accuracy.\n\n8.  Peep Sight is the only best option for longer range targets.  Sadly most of us in Pakistan dont use Peeps.\n\nI hope this much will help.  I am always here to give as much information to all as I can.\n\nRegards,', 1, 0, '202.163.115.148', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

That is not the case with a snap cap, and hence your logic of ''geometrically and mechanically disturbed'' is disturbing.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a snap cap is to safe guard the firing pin, period! A firing ping is forced to stay within its operational specs when a bullet is present since its motion is stopped by the primer. In a dry fire without a snap cap, the firing pin may come to a stop because of opposing forces on the firing pin spring or by exerting pressure on other areas not designed for it. That said, modern semi''s typically do not need it but precaution is always good. Rimfires and older guns should always be used with snapcap for firing.\r\n\r\n@trajan - PLEASE PLEASE do something about the color - use a marker if need be to make red. It might save someones life one day. Even a small source of confusion of live vs dummy round ammo is too great a risk. \r\n\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Wolf Hunter;219707]When we talk of dry firing we must keep this in mind that we are not doing justice to our weapons.Well I ''ll define it for my brothers that while dry firing when triggers is pressed then only the hammer works and only trigger mechanisim functions where as slides does not move.Now you see you deprive your gun ( by a dry fire) from its natural mechanical move and only trigger, hammer, firing pin and firing pin spring start getting worn out leaving the slide , slide spring and ejector untouched/un moved so the proportion of weapon is physicaly, geometrically and mechanically disturbed.So dry firing if not avoided should be kept least minimum.[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '58.27.154.117', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is the be all and end all of  your Home and Self defense needs and the sheer firepower it puts out is enough to put the fear of God into any opponent. The version I was looking for was the 12C (K) Exp-01 with the year of manufacture of 2010. My specific demands were met when a dealer friend sent me an email saying he had one and I picked it up instantly. \n\nThe Exp-01 comes with a side folding stock and my version is the Model 16 which comes with a windage adjustable leaf sight. There are over 25 variations of the Saiga 12 which are mostly the same thing with minor differences. i.e some will have a full length fixed stock, some will have rifle sights, some with wood furniture etc. \n\nThe build quality of the gun is exceptional. This gun is built to last and to be used in all weather conditions. The weight is very reasonable at around 7.7 pounds (3.5 kg) and the barrel length is 17 inches. My gun came with two magazines, one with a mag cap of 8 cartridges and the other of 5. The fore-end (front grip) is made out of hard plastic and quite comfortable to hold, the pistol grip is also more comfortable to hold and shoot than your normal AK grip. \n\nMake no mistake about it, this is not your run of the mill shotgun. It is a high quality Russian made semi auto AK-47 chambered in 12guage. It is also probably the most powerful mass market NPB weapon that you can buy in Pakistan. \n\nSome pictures:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5112[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5113[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5114[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5115[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5116[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5117[/ATTACH]\n\nRange Report and more to follow tonight.

Review continues below.\n\nThe gun came packed in moisture absorbing paper in a cardboard box. The picture below shows what was included with the gun. An English language manual and a certificate of fitness was also there.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5119[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5120[/ATTACH]\n\nDisassembling the gun, I found it to be bone dry. There was not even a single drop of oil or grease even on the springs or rails. The gun has a gas tube setting, 1 for heavy/magnum loads and 2 for light skeet loads. By default my gun was at the 2 setting. So if I had fired it out of the box (without greasing/oiling and resetting the gas tube to 1) it probably would have destroyed the gun in under two boxes of ammo. Also if the boxes I was shooting were heavy loads, the gun would have given me quite a few cycling issues and much heavier recoil. So I oiled the springs and greased the rails, I also set the gas tube to setting 1 with the help of an included tool (which btw I forgot to add to the picture above).  \n\nAs the gun is an AK, I thought you guys would find it more interesting if I posted the pictures of the internals after shooting a couple of boxes though it. Ak''s have much looser tolerances and are meant to foul up less hence never jam on account of fouling. The following pictures were taken with an 18 megapixel DSLR to really try and catch the grime. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5127[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5126[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5125[/ATTACH]\nThe Gas Tube Setting:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5124[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5128[/ATTACH]\nAfter light / quick cleaning:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5129[/ATTACH]\nAmazing right ? Atleast 7 boxes of ammo were shot though it of various different loads and the fouling was next to nothing. The little bit that you see in the second picture was mostly the grease I had applied to the rails. Also as you can see from the pictures above, the internals are the exact same desgin as the Ak47. \n\nComing up: Field Testing and Video''s.', 1, 0, '117.102.35.138', 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I fired off the first round and was surprised, the recoil was much lesser than on shotguns with fancy recoil pads. The gun also has natural point-ability and the SG shot was a ho hum affair for it. It wanted more, [I]lots more[/I]. We started off with shooting Shaheen SG/LG''s at 15 meters. After one mag, the target was toast. The below target picture was taken after two mags and a couple of 12G''s home made slugs though it. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5133[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5136[/ATTACH]\nShooting the Saiga is pure unadulterated [B]100 %[/B] Prime entertainment and fun. It is just so addictive and easy to shoot that once you start shooting it''s hard to stop. In less than a minute we had shot our first box of SG''s though it without a thought. The sights are simple and easy since this is a point and shoot weapon. The trigger is crisp and precise, the bolt action flawless and the muzzle flip/recoil extremely manageable. \n\nThe rate of fire of this gun is just jaw dropping, after putting just one box of ammo though it, I was able to shoot an incredible 6 rounds of SG/LG''s in [B]one[/B] second !! The fully automatic and fearsome USAS 12/AA-12''s shoot 5/6 rounds per second !!\n\nWe moved back to 50 meters and started shooting the homemade slugs, our sights were off but at 50 meters the grouping was quite decent. We did have some trouble getting loaded magazines inserted and locking the bolt back but I did a tutorial video about it today and after watching it no one should have any problems. A few more pictures.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5134[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5135[/ATTACH]\nLooking at this picture, does it look like 12g wants one ?? ;)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5137[/ATTACH]\nWe shot a total of around 150 rounds though the gun of various types like home made slugs, Shaheen #4, Shaheen #6, Shaheen #7, Shaheen SG/LG, Federal hollow point Slugs. All shot flawless. At no point did I readjust the gas port setting back to light loads. All shot reliably without malfunction of any kind on setting #1. I tried my best to make the gun FTE but no matter how loose I kept my grip, how loosely I kept the butt stock on my shoulder it worked every time. I also threw the gun around a bit and planned to do a mud/water test but the horrified expressions I saw on 12g''s, Stigma and Starfish''s faces I thought better not to. ;)\n\n[B][U]The Firepower of the Saiga 12.[/U][/B]\n\nAlthough we don''t allow any automatic / P.B weapon discussion here at PakGuns, since this design is so similar to the most successful combat firearm ever made I have to say a few words on the firepower comparison between the two. \n\nOne magazine of the Ak47 holds 30 rounds compared to the Saiga''s 8 cartridges. The 30 bullets mean 30 independent projectiles available for shooting, with the Saiga''s 8 cartridges of SG/LG, you have 9 projectiles per round times 8, making 72 projectiles at your disposal. The Ak47 has a rate of fire of approximately [B]10[/B] rounds per second. I was able to shoot [B]6 SG/LG''s[/B] in the same time. 6 SG/LG''s mean an incredible [B]54[/B] projectiles per second !!\n\nAlso the Ak is a combat rifle and the long range and automatic fire is useless and even dangerous for civilians who at the most require firearms for self / home defense. The Saiga in my opinion is a much more powerful weapon for self/home defense which under extreme circumstances is still always less than 50 meters. The added versatility of the 12guage rounds and the variety of cartridges available make it much more practical. For example I would load a #4 as a first round in my magazine followed by 2 SG/LG''s followed by another #4. If I hear a noise outside my home, in my lawn for example, I would see which general direction the noise is coming from and if I deem it a threat, I would point in that direction and shoot. The #4 pellets would spread to cover a larger area and have a higher probability of hitting anything there. Even if I score a direct hit the damage would not be enough to kill a human being and give him an opportunity to escape. If he attacks instead then the 2 SG/LG''s would take care of any unfinished business. \n\n[U][B]Conclusion[/B][/U]: If you have self/home defense needs and are looking for a reliable auto loading shotgun, you cannot do better than the Saiga in Pakistan.

You should use the pad of the last digit of your trigger finger (the center part of the finger between the last joint and the finger tip). You should NEVER use your knuckle or joint to pull the trigger. The reason for this is that our hands actually don''t have any muscles; in order to move our fingers we actually use muscles in our wrist and forearm. Therefore the idea is to minimize the number of muscles involved when pulling the trigger so as not to cause what is known as a "muscle stagger" (when more than one muscle is involved in doing a particular task, their collective strength is added and the applied force gets multiplied). So, in order to use as few muscles as possible in order to avoid the muscle stagger (and keep the gun as steady as possible), use the pad of your finger; that way you use only the tip of your finger (and therefore only one muscle in the forearm instead of multiple muscles if you use a joint of the finger).\n\nThird important thing in controlled breathing.

In this scenario we assume that it does then the next thing will be the mode of payment; again most of the sites only accept Paypal. Third and most important aspect you will have to consider will be the Shipping Cost, the cheapest Airmail from Hong Kong (largest Airsoft goods market in Asia and may be in the world) will not be less than $20.\n\nLet’s suppose you have managed all of the above and your bag of BBs has finally reached Pakistan, now comes the Pakistan Customs in picture. I am assuming that the Custom’s Officer inspecting your Parcel is in a very good mood so he will impose the minimum possible duty on the package which will be around Rs. 500 including the ST and resealing.\n\nFingers crossed everything is going smoothly so far so we take it that the parcel has finally reached your doorstep after around a week to 10 days of waiting, now after paying “Eidi” to the postman your bag of BBs will cost you around [B]Rs. 3500[/B].\n\nTaha, I have personally been through the above scenario a couple of times so I would request you to order a bag from the site you have located on the internet and please let me know the actual price you end up paying.\n\nBelieve me even after a total monopoly in this field the prices I have calculated for these products do not leave me with more than 5% to 7% profit. After such a huge investment only an injudicious person like me would be selling at this margin.\n\n [B]Airsoft is more of a hobby to me than business.[/B]\n\nHave you ever wondered why a Glock or Beretta cost what it costs in USA and why does it cost what it costs here in Pakistan?', 1, 1, '119.152.74.136', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Whatever whenever anyone has hunted, in which ever country, province, legal or illegal it is solely at his own discretion and responsibility and we have no power to control or stop it.

I never knew that a bruised shoulder can be so much joy. literally we were practically displaying the black and blue as if it is some kinda honor badge. Kindly allow me to clarify that the bruised shoulder was not Saiga''s fault but it was mine. we were all firing the Russian Beast as if we are warding off a hoard of human flesh craving zombies. we fired slugs in such a manner that at such speed, other shotguns normally see spring and sprockets flying all over the place.\r\n\r\nI can talk for hours and hours about the superb balance, exceptional reliability, bomb-proof durability and quality trigger of Saiga but I would rather say that this shotgun simply boosts the testosterone levels in who ever fires it. with every shot fired you can feel the family jewels weight more and more. I would suggest if one is having hard time making babies, kindly consult SAIGA M.D.\r\n\r\nin my humble opinion, most shotguns cycle. some flawless whereas some less than flawless but a Saiga cycles like this:\r\n\r\nBoom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-\r\n\r\nThe only kinda firearm that probably makes you wish for a zombie invasion. lols!\r\n\r\nNow to the things that I did not like:\r\n\r\n1.

It gets much easier that way. Unfortunately, the bolt does not remain open automatically at ejecting the last round.

Clay shooting is totaly different from wing shooting, First of all consider it, what type of lead (forward allowance) do you use when shooting ducks? \n\n1. Swing-through: let the bird pass your barrel, then swing through it and shoot right at it as you pass through, or... \n\n2. Sustained lead: point at the appropriate distance in front of the bird while moving the barrel with it, then fire. \n\nFriends are asking and sharing about lead and I went straight to swing through but when people talk about lead they mean a sustained lead. \nAlso a very effective method and it also takes lots of practice to judge distance and speed to come up with your lead. \nI have used sustained leads that were probably near 20-30 feet shooting at fast moving divers at 40 yards. But  when ducks there over your decoys and slowed down pointing right at their head or just in front of it is all you need. \n\nThe longer I take to pull the trigger when leading a duck the more often I miss. When I just pull up and swing ahead of it and shoot in one smooth motion I''m more consistant. \nProbably half your battle will be to just get consistant with your gun. \n\nI said there is differance in clay and wing shooting but at the same time clay shooting can improve your swing study for lead. That''s where the clays come in. Don''t go out with just a box or two of shells and call it good.  Get to the point where after you shoot you don''t remember seeing the bead on your barrel or much of anything else but the target exploding. Don''t aim your shotgun. \nIf you''re aiming you''re concentrating on the bead and not the bird. When you don''t have to "think" about what your gun is doing you''re getting somewhere.\nAnother thing to consider is that your shot is probably leaving the barrel between 1200 & 1500 feet per second depending on what you''re shooting (Skeeter60 already defined very well).\n\n If those pellets stayed at 1500 fps for one second they would go 500 yards in that time. They get to 30 or 40 yards pretty quick but a duck can move right out of the way in that amount of time too.', 1, 1, '110.36.12.88', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When shooting on the target your alignment of the gun is almost straight and perfect but taking the bird on flying shots it entirely different. In this case normally you align the gun from 30-90 degrees and the most valid error is to point the flying object only with the fore sight.

An area should emerge, after five or six shots, where the bulk of the shot is concentrated and for every inch that the pattern is &#8220;off&#8221; target, the stock will need to be adjusted by a 1/16 th of an inch. So, by the same rule, that ¼ inch head lift converts into the shot going 4 inches high at 16 yards, twice that at 30 yards. At 40 yards a ½ inch head lift (and believe it or not, some shooters will come off the gun even more than this!)\r\nwhen we also factor the shot-drop in at this greater distance, may mean that well over ½ the original payload will miss the target. And here&#8217;s a word of caution. I see many clients, when using a pattern board under my supervision, concentrate hard on their gun mount and consciously align their eye with the rib every time. The result is a flawless point of impact printout on the board. &#8220;Ah hah&#8221;! Mr. Good mount says triumphantly. &#8220;Told you so.

Anyhow, if experts have overlooked your query I would like to share whatever i know about it. \n\nSwing always mean to move barrel in the line of the flight of the object matching its trajectory and velocity. Better you catch the both, better you will hit. You missed any of them your chances squeezed. Practice and time will bring improvement automatically. Persistently following this practice you will be a good shooter one day. However natural instinct is an additional feature. I have experienced many new shooters quickly reached the satisfactory stage. Concept should remain unchanged rest will improve by practice.\n\nI would second the champion (Skeeter60) that sometimes you need to change your shooting style at once. For example, for long crossing birds I always swing an additional second to pull the trigger, it covers the leading concept to some extent but I did it in my routine. Similarly there are several more to know which one learn automatically like shifting of weight for high incoming bird to back foot or leaning forward for dropping bird etc. \n\nIn beginning I was being taught for two technics for overhead crossing bird and dropping ahead from rare bird. \n\nFor overhead crossing upward swing the barrel, cross the bird and hide full bird behind your barrels then pull the trigger and continue swing. For dropping downwards bird swing down the barrel, cross the bird and take the full bird over the barrel &#8230;. Bang with Swing &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. Both worked well throughout my life. Interesting thing is here to perform it all in a row without looking at barrels; otherwise, one will miss in both cases by feet behind the bird. \n\nWhatever, I have said is solely my own experience and I am not advocating to follow, however, if my practice needs some more improvement please feel free to advise me.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nSpeechless.

This would make the gun very hot but not hot enough to do damage.  Then another round of 100 rounds another day using the same procedure. My thought process behind this is that most  important factor to check in my handguns is reliability and this is to ensure that any TIGHT  clearances (that  are so close that as the gun heats up and the metal expands, the components will  rub enough to slow down the slide) would be smoothed out.   The objective of breaking in a gun is to wear enough off of these tight-fit  surfaces so there is sufficient clearance to enable them to slide smoothly over  one another even when the gun is hot, while not adversely affecting accuracy.\n\nAll my pistols are tactical use type pistols which have fairly loose tolerances when compared with customs-tightly fit pistols.The criteria I use  for determining whether a gun is broken in or needs more testing is how it  ejects.

The speed of sound is about 1100fps. At this speed, your accuracy will suffer and there are more chances of your prey being scared away. Shooters select heavy pellets for such types of airguns so they keep the velocity under the speed of sound barrier, they have to give away a bit of personal choice.. You won''t find many different varieties in heavier pellets. .22 cal also delivers more energy thus gives cleaner kills at longer ranges. I PERSONALLY DON''T KNOW ABOUT GAMO SOCOM. You have choices like Gamo Raptor, Shadow 1000, Whisper and another one or two models available in Pak don''t remember the names. It will be good if you find any of these in .177 other than Shadow 1000. RWS34 is available in .177 cal in Classic and Panther variants, fps on chronographs are 15-20 fps higher than Gamo Shadow 1000 in .177, why not give it a try if you can handle the WEIGHT, though the Panther variant has lesser weight.

The more harder is the steel the more life of its sharp edge. In knives manufacturing 440 hardness of stainless steel is considered the best and it comes from Japan. On the other hand damascus is totally different technology. They make the ordinary steel more harder than any other steel. They take a steel sheet melt it, fold it and press in such a way that both the parts penetrate in each other. They repeat the same process in one sheet for 450 times, melting, folding and pressing.......(This is what they claims) and the ultimate product achieves extreme and optimum hardness. It is to be said that this technology was introduced in 12th century by a blacksmith in damascus and there in after Japanese refined the process.

The front sight bead was again put back by the gun smith.The  transformation was excellent, it always brought down partridges quail, and ducks with consistency and to our greatest satisfaction.No 7 and 8  cartridges was the medicine for all kind of upland wing shooting and even for ducks on decoys.On high flying ducks of course No 4. It was named by my sons as our Holland and Holland.\n\nIf you are about to buy a gun  for your self always go for improved cylinder in the right barrel and modified choke in the left barrel for a fixed choke gun side by side.Of course in a gun with interchangeable chokes there is no problem.  \n\nSince you have already bought your gun, for flushed partridges you have to wait them out for the pattern to spread considerably and also to minimize the chances of spoiling the bird for the table.', 1, 0, '180.178.190.33', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When you choose to buy a weapon you have to see a lot of things, like its availability in the local market, its caliber, size, suitability for which you are choosing it, potency and finally the price. Its not the best weapon out there in CC category but considering its price it is good, roughly around 55k. Other options might be Rami or a Glock 26, but if you have more money. Its biggest advantage is its very small size. In my opinion A Baikal MP-442 or Makarov is also a very good choice for a CCW. Mak has less mag capacity whereas MP-442 has more. But in this price range the Slim beats them all. The only thing which I have found difficult to master in this gun is the trigger, and hence accuracy.

I really cant explain what it feels like but Single set trigger just breaks you don''t feel anything else than BOOM here goes bullet down range, shooter trying it out first time (like I did today ;) ) surely get surprised by 2 or 3 unintentional  discharges ;)\n\nCZ-527 has free floating barrel which normally is flaunted in photos with 100 dollar note between barrel & stock fore end ;) to show barrel is not sitting on or in contact with stock. A free floating barrel is one of the traits a match rifle has to increase & maintain the accuracy.\n\n   \n  Fired total of 30 rounds today (mixed) without any issue of any sort. One thing noticed though not sure if its because rifle being new or characteristic of .223''s lean bolt or detachable magazine but found bolt bit hard or unstable to push (than my Parker Hale 7mm Mauser), had to apply more force to push it to chamber.\n   \n  Now to the bullet weight vs rifling twist; what ever I read was CORRECT..... 55 grn was the most accurate at 65 meters and NATO 5.56x45  is far better than Norinco FMJ among both 55grainer I tried.  75grn HP BT Armscor behaved worst, bullets dropped at target like an SG/LG balls would from 30 meters, that made me repenting on my greed which caused me buying 100 rounds; these have no use now, will try replacing these with NATO 55grn.\n\n  NATO 62grn (steel core; green tipped ones) were not that accurate but lot better than 75grn ones, I can try on boars after a little practice with these.\n   \n  Now the issue of 5.56 rounds in .223 chamber, main reason for buying this particular rifle was the CZ''s assurance that this rifle can be used with 5.56 as a regular fodder. I was trying to get a .22 mag for range rifling but as soon as got to know that CZ had one .223 rifle in their range that can eat cheaper 5.56 ammo I just dropped the idea of .22mag, although had to drop 200k more along with the idea but a center fire rifle is lot more RIFLE than a rim fired ;) specially when you can get the center fire ammo at the same price you would get rim fired.\n   \n  Now; little bit of porn at range ;)  (hope you like the gun rest)       \n      \n\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/001.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/002.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/003.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/004.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/005.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/006.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/007.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/008.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '182.178.153.215', 14, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Companies manufacturing cleaning materials are charging for convenience with products like bore snake. The bore / barrel can also be cleaned by swabs but bore snake is very quick. I personally use the traditional metal rod. Secondly one spends thousands of rupees in acquiring a good firearm but is stingy when it comes to buying high quality gun cleaning material and ammo. In the long run these things pay off.\n\nReplacing a weapon within the 60k range is easy when the gun starts to catch rust and not perform to its fullest but the same scenario in 100k plus pistols will incur heavy losses in the second hand market.  The more you maintain your firearm the higher chances are that it won''t fail you when the time comes.

Some very premium bullets would also consistently expand at velocities below the above mentioned figure, but they would be for specialized used such as for use with silencers (being subsonic @ velocities less than 1100 fps- speed of sound being around 1150 fps around sea-level).\nIf you can find 10 rounds of JHP''s i would suggest finding some +P rated bullets which are meant for higher velocities that would ensure more effective penetration.     You can check out  \n[URL]http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/9mmluger.html[/URL]   for a list of popular handgun 9mm parabellum bullets here which are listed with their velocities.    It is to be noted that the bullet velocity is also LARGELY dependent on the size of the barrel you are shooting them out of. For all  practical purposes  a bullet fired from a longer barrel would have a higher velocity (and hence increased effectiveness). i could not find PROPER statistics on the ARMSCOR 9mm in 124 grain JHP, but apparently their 124 grain FMJ''s are rated at 1090 fps  as per [URL]http://www.fivesevenammo.com/shop/page10.html[/URL] \n\nI would really not worry too much about this stuff. Just practice on your shot placement under stressful conditions (quick draw from cc position). If you can quickly tap the target 1x plus  in the proper area (more is always better) under stress and with decent JHP''s, these things pretty much become secondary.', 1, 1, '115.186.111.155', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I have shot them with No 6 and even 8 over decoys.\n\nUsing a duck call will also help in luring them near your hide, but use it sparingly, you can use decoys to your advantage too but don''t spread them too far apart.When they come in you can recognise them by the heavy swishing wing noise, and hear the splash when they alight near the decoys.\n\nHope this will help. \n\nGood luck.', 1, 0, '223.29.231.130', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Companies manufacturing cleaning materials are charging for convenience with products like bore snake. The bore / barrel can also be cleaned by swabs but bore snake is very quick. I personally use the traditional metal rod. Secondly one spends thousands of rupees in acquiring a good firearm but is stingy when it comes to buying high quality gun cleaning material and ammo. In the long run these things pay off.\n\nReplacing a weapon within the 60k range is easy when the gun starts to catch rust and not perform to its fullest but the same scenario in 100k plus pistols will incur heavy losses in the second hand market.  The more you maintain your firearm the higher chances are that it won''t fail you when the time comes.

For people who own guns for Sport/Hunting this suggestion MIGHT be valid as if the gun fails to perform, its just a missed shot.\r\nComing to people who own guns for SD, this suggestion is totally invalid, IMHO, as you cannot afford a gun to malfunction on you in such a scenario.\r\nThis has been discussed profoundly throughout PG and we all know that the issue is not of Patriotism but of low quality control. The base metals/alloys used are not of good quality and the processes are not stansardized.

The ammo is cheap, the bang is low, and with using RWS subsonic bullets its no more than a spring airgun and there isn''t any recoil at all. In result that adds the benefit of even installing the most menial scope with menial mounts and still you will be getting great results at 100yds. As the rains struck sindh this monsoon, water-fowling has become very difficult if not impossible. But again if one has a .22lr at hand one can always go for water fowling without even stepping in the water. Though i have been searching myself for a decent riflescope but haven''t succeeded yet. I have CZ 452 standard, and installed a BSA Sweet rifle scope 3-9x40mm. I shot a stray dog from about 50 yards under its ear and the dog fell in its tracks. We have already discussed alot about .22lr''s lethality but as I have used the caliber i have learned that the prime thing is the shot placement without which one will never be able to drop any game in its track. I have seen doves flying off shot with 40 grain FMJs due to poor shot placement, as the bullet passed clean through the dove flew and fell after some distance, result of which was the bird couldn''t be retrieved or tracked. I have more to share as well regarding this beautiful rifle and the caliber that i will share later, for the time being it would be an honor to read about the experience of fellow members with this caliber and rifle.[/FONT][/COLOR][/URL]\n[/QUOTE]\n     \n[COLOR=#ff0000]P:S Edited the thread title & Post , regarding dove banned specie .

Sooooo, today I got a much anticipated call from a brother of mine to come over to the Isb Gun Club and to bring the FN 5.7 as well.\nTwo variants were fired at approx. 25meters or 27yards at paper targets.  I shot only five rounds at paper and had fun putting dents in the quarter inch steel plates.  There is a video of all this I am trying to get edited which I will also post later on this thread... maybe by Saturday along with many more pics.\nGetting back to the guns, there was a adjustable sight model and a fixed night sight model to fire at the range.  Each fired about fifty rounds through the respective weapons - aside from the sights the only other variation was that on the fixed sight model a hogue finger groove sleeve was added for support and comfort.  My personal preference has always been aggressive checkering/design for grip on the grip which the FN has.  Both guns have the following: ambi safety placed in front/top of trigger guard, ambi mag housing allowing you to switch mag rel sides, a loaded indicator, the top of the slide is also housed in plastic (going a little overboard if you ask me) to give it a more appealing look.\nI picked up my FN and we danced.  Bang!  Wow!  I couldn''t believe it, exactly as stated by many owners, literally no felt recoil or atleast 30% less than 9mm.  AMAZING, the video will show my ear to ear grin as I was firing this doll.  The grip is very ergonomic and slim considering the magazine capacity is 20 rounds.  The sight picture was clean and clear.  The only thing I felt needed work was the trigger.  Although, very stiff, it was still very crisp and very smooth, there was no trigger lag.  Another amazing thing we discovered about both pistols - the ejected rounds all landed three feet to the front/right of the shooter AND all the spent casings were no more than a foot apart on the ground in one location.  Most guns'' casings end up everywhere.\nHere are the pics:\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/photo2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/DSC03599.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/DSC03596.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-2.jpg[/IMG]\nThe target above is mine - 25 METERS firing first time.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-1.jpg[/IMG]\nThe target above is my brother Baluch''s (PG member) also firing for the first time at 25 METERS.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/IMG_0038.jpg[/IMG]\n\nMe and our new member Baluch (forum name).\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/IMG_0056.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '115.186.153.47', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Basically even with the Section 144 exemption I cannot carry the firearm with a round chambered or the magazine isnserted in the firearm if the magazine has rounds.\n\nThere are three separate and potentially conflicting definitions of a "loaded" firearm which are applicable depending upon the circumstances. 1) Under Penal Code Section 12031 (g) a firearm is considered loaded when there is a live round of ammunition "...in, or attached in any manner to, the firearm, including, but not limited to, in the firing chamber, magazine, or clip thereof attached to the firearm...". For example, a semi-automatic gun with an empty firing chamber and a loaded magazine inserted in the magazine well is considered loaded. Further, under the "attached in any manner to" language, using certain accessories which attach to the firearm and are designed to store additional ammunition may cause the firearm to be considered loaded. A charged muzzle-loader is not loaded if it is not capped or primed. This definition applies while on any public street or in any public place in an incorporated city, or on any public street or in any public place where it is unlawful to discharge a firearm in unincorporated territory. If a person is in the process of committing or attempting to commit a felony, a firearm is considered loaded if ammunition is in the person''s "immediate possession."', 1, 0, '39.47.183.51', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Ammo price of this thing varies so no SET rate as I have picked up rounds for as low as 50/rs as well as up to 2000/rs a ridiculous round!\n\nThis gun in my opinion, had there not been an issue with ammo, makes for a great hip-carry-gun.  I won''t wear it on the ankle.  Then again mine is not for carry; I wanna slowly make it a range gun.  Its lighter than a G19 loaded atleast it definately felt like that.  I don''t have a trigger pull measuring gauge but I felt it to be around 5 or 6 lbs.  I opened it up to see if this problem could be remedied but the trigger and other springs were coil (non compression) springs meaning cutting a coil or two will only render this pistol workless.  Still I too don''t give up that easy... other springs are on the way along with a threaded barrel ;-).

Previously migrated ducks have left this area and migrated ahead to avoid the heat weave presistantly hitting till last week.\n\nGood flocks are being reported at chashma these da.

Even though I''ve shot quite a bit, I always keep a print out of this chart with me at the Range. A quick glance at it instantly corrects one''s errors.\n\n\n\n[B]The Wheel of Misfortune[/B]\nEvery day of the shooter''s life brings a new lesson. Identifying errors are crucial in order that these lessons be learned. The following chart can help pinpoint such basic flaws in a shooter''s technique by analyzing group locations. As printed, it is for a right-handed shooter. (A left-hander''s chart would be mirrored horizontally.)\n\n[IMG]http://www.adjunct.diodon349.com/attack_on_usa/pistol_and_revolver_error_analysis_and_correction_files/image002.gif[/IMG]\n\n [B]Top Eleven Bad Habits of Shooters[/B]\n[B]1.         Not Looking at the Sights. [/B]This quite frequently is listed as "looking at the target." A shooter may be focusing his eye on neither the sights nor the target, but since he does not see the target in clear focus he assumes he is looking at the sights. You must concentrate on sight alignment. \n2.         [B]Holding Too Long. [/B]Any adverse conditions that interrupt a shooter''s ability to "hold" will cause him to delay his squeeze, waiting for conditions to better. The disturbing factor about this is that you will do it unconsciously; therefore, you must continuously ask yourself, am I being too particular? \n[B]3.         Improper Grip or Position. [/B] Suffice to say that you cannot fire a decent score with any gun at any range if you continually change your grip or position. \n4.         [B]Jerk or Heel. [/B]The application of pressure either with the trigger finger alone or in case of the heel, pushing with the heel of the hand at the same time. Apply pressure to the trigger straight to the rear and wait for the shot to break. \n5.         [B] Anticipation. [/B] Anticipation can cause muscular reflexes of an instant nature that so closely coincide with recoil that extreme difficulty is experienced in making an accurate call. Anticipation is also the sire to flinching. \n6.         [B]Loss of Concentration.[/B] If the shooter fails in his determination to apply positive pressure on the trigger while concentrating on the front sight his prior determination needs renewal and he should rest and start over. \n7.         [B]Anxiety. [/B]You work and work on a shot, meanwhile building up in your mind doubt about the shot being good. Finally you shoot just to get rid of that particular round so you may work on the others. \n8.         [B]Vacillation (Plain Laziness). [/B] This is a mental fault more than a physical one, which results in your accepting minor imperfections in your performance which you could correct if you worked a little harder. The end result being you hope you get a good shot. Just like you hope you will get a gratis tax refund, and you will get one just about as frequently as you get the other. \n9.         [B]Lack of Follow Through. [/B] Follow through is the subconscious attempt to keep everything just as it was at the time the shot broke. In other words you are continuing to fire the shot even after it is gone. Follow through is not to be confused with recovery. Merely recovering and holding on the target after the shot is no indication that you are following through. \n10.     [B]Lack of Rhythm. [/B]Hesitancy on the first shot or any subsequent shot in timed or rapid fire. Develop a good rhythm and then have the fortitude to employ it every case. Frequently many shooters will have fine rhythm until the last shot of a string and then hesitate, doctoring up that last shot. \n11.     [B]Match Pressure. [/B]If there are 200 competitors in a match, rest assured that there are 200 shooters suffering from match pressure. So what makes you think you are so different? If you are exerting all your mental energy toward executing the correct fundamentals rather than the arithmetic evaluation, your shooting match pressure will be what you feel when people congratulate you on a fine performance.', 1, 0, '117.102.33.113', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

My father, this very evening, unveiled a sterling piece of family history: an Astra 200 "Firecat" which belonged to my paternal grandmother. This gun was manufactured in Spain by "Astra Unceta y Cía". My grandmother bought it in 1966 as a CC weapon from Majeed & Sons here in Lahore. It''s a 6.35mm (.25) caliber semi-auto, carries 5 rounds in the mag, comes with 3 safeties (grip safety, magazine disconnecter & thumb safety). It''s an all-metal gun (frame, slide, grip, etc) with a chromed barrel and feels quite solid. The slide rides smoothly and trigger pull is crisp with very little creep (I dry fired it a few times, don''t know if that gives me an exact representation of trigger pull with a round in the chamber). The magazine release is actually a little latch on the heel of the grip which needs to be pulled back to release the mag, therefore switching mags is a real pain. Other than that, it''s quite a little pocket rocket! Only thing left is to take it down to the range and let it rip! :-)\n\nMy grandmother bought a box of 25 rounds with the gun and, till date, this gun has fired only [B]FIVE[/B] rounds; so it''s basically in near-mint condition. Don''t know much else about the gun, except that it fit quite well in my hand (and I have big, beefy hands!) and was pretty comfortable. Despite being all-metal, it''s light enough to carry around in your pocket without any discomfort.\n\nHere are a couple of pics I took (please excuse the poor results, I was way too excited to run & get my camera, so used my cellphone instead!)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5460[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5461[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5462[/ATTACH]\n\nI had a couple of questions:-\n1)  The ammo is almost 40 years old (bought in 1966), so is it still safe to shoot?\n2)  Is the ammo for this gun (6.35mm) available in Lahore/Islamabad?', 1, 1, '110.36.101.177', 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Didn''t really get a chance to play with it till today.\n\nIt''s a fun toy, looks and weighs very much like the Glock 17 except it doesn''t have any markings. Airsoft was telling me he''s getting new ones in stock with markings but this one looks original enough. The only thing included in the box is the gun itself and a mag. Not much else to say about it except the build quality is average. I would be quite careful while disassembling it, the dis assembly lug is just a piece of plastic and will break quite easily. The sights have a glow in the dark kinda paint on them, a few minutes in the sun and they will start to glow a bit. The mag holds around 25 BB''s and the mag on full gas will fire almost all of them. The gas nossel is found under the magazine butt plate. The amusing thing is the ''safe action'' trigger almost works like the original.\n\nOut of curiosity I tried to see how far the BB would go on a full magazine before it hits the ground. Was surprised to find that it almost goes a distance of 45 meters ! Below are some pictures and a target shot at 15 and 10 meters.

After taking the leopard and lion on a South African hunt with Ingogo Safaris in 2006, he returned to Africa in 2008 to harvest a Cape buffalo. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQKhx2TyzbUsvIsGPglduRrin9sHpV5QSrDZWNHSZoMvx1wCl1boA[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThat same year, he also brought down a rhino on a green hunt, during which he used a tranquilizer dart as ammunition and the animal was released unharmed after being examined by a South African wildlife and conservation biologist. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://c362.r62.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/articles/Butch_display.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOn all of Meilinger''s hunts, his weapon of choice was a Horton Archery crossbow. During the first three successful trips -- the leopard, lion and Cape buffalo -- he used a Legend 175 but after speaking with Horton''s pro staff head Riley Foster, he opted for a Team Realtree 175 for the last trip because of its accuracy and the fact that it''s lightweight and easy to transport. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://c362.r62.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/articles/legend_175_display.jpg [/IMG]\r\n\r\nIn order to give him the best chance of effectively penetrating an elephant''s thick skin, Meilinger also had Danny Miller of Sardis, Ohio, custom craft six heavy-duty carbon bolts for the hunt. \r\n\r\nHunting with Helgard Beukes of Somerby Safaris, the same outfitter he had used for the rhino trip, Meilinger began his pursuit of an elephant along the Matetsi River, adjacent to a forestry reserve that was closed to hunting and served as a refuge for the animals. \r\n\r\n"What we did was we would ride around all through the day trying to find something we could approach, specifically a lone bull because it''s less difficult than approaching a herd," Meilinger said. "After six days, I had seen 60 or 70 in herds but they were always in the protected forestry area where we were not allowed to go." \r\n\r\nAt night, Meilinger, Beukes and crew would set up in a blind at a watering hole between the refuge and some agricultural areas the elephants were visiting to feed. While they were hoping to ambush their prey, they were also hoping they wouldn''t become dinner for another hunter patrolling the area. \r\n\r\n"There was a lion hunting that water hole, too. We saw him a couple times. He was there five or six nights," Meilinger said. "It was quite unnerving to have him roaring for two or three minutes nonstop every 20 minutes to two hours." \r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of the hunt, Meilinger finally got his chance at an elephant after the hunting party saw two large bulls traveling in a group of about 15 or 16 animals. \r\n\r\n"We actually saw these two bulls cross just before dark as we were heading back (to the watering hole), so we scrambled because when they got down to the bottom of this ridge, if they turned right they were going to that conservation area, and if they turned left they were going to that water hole," he said. \r\n\r\nFortunately for Meilinger, the animals made a left. After carefully but quickly making their way toward the watering hole, the hunting party caught up with the herd. \r\n\r\nWith the wind in his favor, Meilinger stalked to within 16 yards of one of the bulls and was able to make a perfect shot that put the animal down. \r\n\r\n"As photos were being taken, I can remember feeling like a huge burden was lifted," he said. "When I first took the leopard, I had no idea if it was even possible to take Africa''s Big 5 with a crossbow. I guess what made this so special was that no one had ever done this before." \r\n\r\nAccording to Meilinger, the elephant''s left tusk was 53 inches long and weighed 31.5 pounds while the right one was 54 inches long and weighed 32.5 pounds. The animal is the pending No. 2 crossbow harvest in the Safari Club International record books and Meilinger has had replicas of the ivory made for his home. \r\n\r\nThe elephant itself, however, was given to a nearby village, which put the entire animal to good use. \r\n\r\n"The next morning, 15 or 20 people came from the village with their children and with baskets on their backs," Meilinger said. "They get all the meat from that animal, every piece. They worked on it, they skinned it out. \r\n\r\n"The ivory goes to the government, which then turns it over to wildlife artists and craftspeople who then sell it and generate revenue for their villages. There were 42 to 46 people in that village. They were going to be in supply of meat for 70 to 90 days." \r\n\r\nWhile Meilinger is indeed proud of harvesting the elephant, he says the most memorable and challenging of the hunts was his pursuit of a leopard. Not only was it an incredibly difficult animal to locate and get close to, he also had a too-close-for-comfort encounter with the big cat when he finally caught up with one. \r\n\r\nAfter unsuccessfully pursuing leopards on two previous hunts, Meilinger was finally able to get close to one on his third hunt after a pack of hounds cornered the animal. During the encounter, however, the cat turned and charged Meilinger''s vehicle, ultimately leaping at another jeep that had pulled into the oncoming animal''s path. \r\nAlthough he eventually killed the leopard, Meilinger called it "four minutes of hell." \r\n\r\n"He slammed into the wheel well on the driver''s side, dented it, went underneath (the jeep) and bit the valve stem on the left front tire, which went flat," he said. "He came back out on the driver''s side, jumped up and hooked the rain guard, and literally the only thing separating his face from the driver''s face was the window. He slapped and cracked the window twice and took off." \r\n\r\nWhile Meilinger is now busy planning for a trip to the Arctic to pursue musk ox, he says taking Africa''s Big 5 is an accomplishment he will never forget, especially considering he did it with a crossbow. \r\n\r\n"It takes a lot of effort to accomplish some of the things I have done. Without a doubt, the trackers and professional hunters are the most important," he said.', 1, 1, '119.152.165.195', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It means how well a bullet will overcome air resistance. The higher the BC number the better it would resist air. Air resistance is the biggest enemy of bullet velocity. It increases with the increase in velocity and it depends heavily on the following;\n\nCaliber and Weight ratio\nLet us say we are using a rifle, we should know that the heavier bullets of any given caliber will be more likely to resist air depending on the factors mentioned below.\n\nSHAPE\nA pointed bullet or a Spitzer bullet will have a higher Ballistic co-effecient than a Round nose or Flat nose bullet or a Semi Spitzer Bullet\n\nBASE\nThe bullet base plays an important role in reducing Air resisitance, a Boat Tail Bullet will have a higher BC or better ability to resist air than a flat base. \n\nNow that we are aware of the factors we can say that the heavier bullets of a given caliber with Spitzer points and boat tails will have a higher ability to retain velocity and resist air and there fore will have flatter trajectory and higher terminal energy.\n\nIngall made the tables for BC in the US by using a 1000 grain bullet of .50 cal with different shapes and bases and the Ingalls tables were used as a reference for a long time.\nThe science of aero dynamics has progressed so much that the trajectory of a bullet can be predicted extremely well over a long range when barometeric pressure, humidity and temperature are known.\nAlso it has been discovered that the BC changes with very high velocities, and yet again as the velocity of the projectile begins to drop due to air resistance. The Dopler Radars have been used to completely profile the trajectory of each type of bullet with varying BC and velocity and the complete trajectory can be predicted to the entire length of flight of the bullet. \nFor our basic hunting knowledge and purposes I think we have a fair understanding and we can discuss it further in Q&A  form', 1, 1, '58.27.154.85', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I have seen Neel Gai taken with a .243 at 250 yds a fluke as the bullet passed between the ribs and was stopped after passing through  the heart;\n and have also known of a so called shikari who took one with a .22-250 at 30 yds with a neck shot; this was a  "Khan sama " shot with a search light in the poor animals eyes.\n In real day light hunting first of all a Neel Gai will never be visible except in the rut season and that also at least 300 to 400 yds away. If animals are to be murdered sitting in a jeep with a search light in their eyes then this is a futile discussion. Any caliber will kill at 30 yds. \nIf we are to take fair day light shots on Neel Gai then 30-06 or 7mm mag or a 7mm Mauser with heavy 160 to 175 grain bullets is the answer. \nA 7mm Mauser is now almost 125 years old and still popular for good reasons it fires long heavy bullets at almost the same velocity as a 270 and these are so lethal that Major W.D.

This made it popular in Africa, where it was used on animals up to and including elephants, for which it was particularly favoured by noted ivory hunter W. D. M. Bell, who shot 1,011 elephants using a 7×57mm rifle, when most ivory hunters were using larger-caliber rifles.

The Mauser should have a slight advantage if handloaded in a modern rifle.\r\n\r\nFor point blank shooting ~300 yards and inside the .308 should carry more energy in factory loads. Way, way out there the 7mm''s better BC means it might have more energy (I haven''t broken out the carts to check).\r\n\r\n.308 is easier to find and last I checked it was a fair amount cheaper to buy factory loads.\r\n\r\nThe Mauser has less recoil/muzzle blast and is more pleasant to shoot given all things equal. The .308 isn''t a bear in the recoil department, but it is above the 15 lb recommendation for new shooters (weight can tame it below).\r\n\r\nThe Mauser really shines when handloaded, but it''s really more than adequate for almost all medium game in almost all situations in factory form.\r\n\r\nThe .308 is a genuine short action round, the 7x57 is inbetween long and short and called intermediate length (but is usually put into a long action). This is not an issue if you are looking at a single shot like the Ruger #1.\r\n\r\nI consider anything beyond 300 yards out of normal hunting ranges. Out to 400 yards the both maintain more than a 1000 ft-lbs of energy. There is only on average 2" of difference between the trajectories as well at 400 yards.

I know that the rimfire is a nasty creature when it comes to the sensitivity of its rim. I did observed all the possible safety measures i could, and trust me no one likes me more than myself:).\r\nI removed the tip of the bullet from the case took out all the powder out of it and then divided it into three parts and then put back that 1/3 of the powder back. Though i am still struggling to find a correct and better way of taking the tip out without damaging the case. I don''t have any tools that would assist in the reloading process but the fact is my reloading is for the sole purpose of less risky plinking and not to undertake some big game in the wilds. here''s the video watch impact and listen to reduced bang of the .22lr. there is another video using a standard bullet watch, compare and comment.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpKDex85H9k[/url]   (Homemade Subsonic)\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVd4OVW9aq8[/url]  (Standard armscor ammo)\r\n\r\nP.S: As stated in the thread topic this is just an idiotic experiment.

Thanks go to Joshua Stevens, the father of the 22LR, who developed the cartridge in 1887.  If it was not for this inventor, designer, and manufacturer, we can picture the fun missing from our lives. The Stevens company’s history goes back to 1864. In 1920 Savage Arms bought Stevens Arms. Some guns were identified until 1936 as Savage-Stevens. Savage used the Stevens brand name until 1950. During the life of the Stevens brand, it manufactured several types of firearms in several calibers, including the now world famous 22LR. Just one company alone in the world - CCI manufactures 4,000,000 LR cartridges every day. There are dozens of other companies that also manufacture the 22LRs. You can pretty much imagine the quantity of 22LRs manufactured, sold and expended every day of the year.\n \nPrior to starting his own firearms business, Stevens worked for Samuel Colt - the inventor of the 45 Colt pistol; Eli Whitney - the inventor of the cotton gin; Cyrus Allen - manufacturer of the turret repeaters; and Massachusetts Arms Company - now known as Smith & Wesson.\n \nAgain, let us give full credit to Joshua Stevens for bringing out a cartridge that makes many millions happy - including me.

Members on the site have already taken notice of my absence for a while.\n\nUnless someone is willing to expend oodles of money on custom guns, working around the variables that can be controlled is the way to go for accuracy. I hope we both agree that two rifles coming from the assembly lines in sequence will behave differently using the same ammo in both guns. If there is agreement on this point, then we can discuss the variable that we can control. \n\nMost gunners use commercial ammo for their needs. The ones that are into competition shooting are more demanding than the casual shooter.  The 22LR caliber is a breed into itself that can be discussed at another time. As to the center-fire commercial ammo, many of the variables can be tested without firing the cartridge. I have weighed cartridges and taken measurements of neck diameter and bullet depth dept from the ogive point. I have taken apart these cartridges to weigh the projectile, propellant and the case capacity. Finding changes in all these elements introduces comulitive degrees  of error when the weapon is fired. At this point in time we are not considering the variables that of the weapon itself. With a commercial cartridge, the least we can do it is to sort it by weight and test those on the range that weigh the same. Of course the more makes and types of ammo you test, the better the chance of finding the ideal fodder. A cartridge that is good on the range may not be suitable in the field. Where I am, hunt is allowed only with sold point bullets.  \n\nNow we turn attention to hand loading. Here we have ample opportunity to control many of the variables. Other than the variation of the propellant within a given batch, we can precisely weight the power, weigh the the bullet and its dimensions,  and adjust the seater die for a consistent depth. Having "precision" die   helps in controlling the depth to a precise point. Once the cartridge is ready we test it at the firing range. Now we can vary adjust and monitor our two main variables - namely the propellant weight and the seating depth. We go back to the range and test again. The starting point of this exercise of reloading is to rely on well established reloading handbooks with a caution - for safety sake, not to exceed the maximums given in those handbooks. The key to accuracy repeatability - each time, each element of the cartridge to be the same.\n \nAs to what can be done to the weapon itself to improve  accuracy,  that is a topic for another day.', 1, 1, '75.140.11.190', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Courier service IIRC took around 02 days.[/QUOTE]\n\nCollected mine today, from OCS Godown at Korangi Industrial Area after 7 sur QAWALI to their operations staff... opened the box to see it neatly packed in plastic with one additional spring.Box was intact. no damage at all... O M G it had tons of Grease on it.. :) Cleaned it to see the actual airgun.. bai wah it is pretty good.. lovely bluing and stock finish... Couldnt wait to fire a few shots with it at say 30 metres range.... the first shot actually pierced a pieca of wood (irani pellet 5.5 mm pointed tip).. hmm. power seems to be good. aimed and shot say 15 pellets at the same range.. it is off target.. say about 3 inches to the right and 2 inches above. but pellets landed consistently in the same area.. about an inch apart (i was not using a rest)... left kaisay kerooon? errr errr errrr.. Moawia bhai sight has up down setting but no left right.. Jaldee bunayain left right adjustable wala. Kidding :mod:. I''ll be mounting a scope on it once ive shot atleast 300 shots with it. Ppl attempting to zero in a scope before properly breaking in wont be able to zero or perhaps setting may change after 50 odd initial shots. \n\n2 Questions for Moawia.\n\n1. Does it have a leather piston seal? I have two spare synthetic piston seals for my other Diana 45..If the diameter is same will it fit? Synthetic seal is known for faster piston speed and also seals better (more compression). Leather seal is kinda more forgiving if airgun is shot accidentally empty and overall it is more reliable in the long run but needs some silicone oil say 2 drops a yr of USE to avoid leather hardening. Airgun should never be fired empty as it results in seal/ piston and or compression tube damage... Heard even loose pellets (pakistani) deteriorate seal quality but thats more gradual.\n\n\n2. The Spare spring has 34 coils, the same as my original Diana 45 spring also 34 coils which i have in spare. But wire diameter of original Diana seems to be more than the Rainbow Spare spring provided. Both springs have same length? Do u recommend a spring change now or should i break it in on its original spring n when it starts showing loss of power i shuld get it changed? \n\nAs for barrel lube Ive tested and regularly used [B]Slick 50 One Lube[/B] spray once a year, it contains PTFE (teflon). THe same non stick material used on non-stick pans and household steam iron. Clean the barrel, 2 small bursts down the barrel, keep the airgun upright to let it sink into the compression tube. It reduces Lead Dust in the barrel which causes inaccuracy and also lubes seal and cylinder wall with teflon, maintains piston speed. Fire 10 dry pellets and u r good for a year. Mineral oil is a no no for compression tube as it causes dieselling and sticking which slows down piston speed and reduced FPS. Ofcourse silicone oil is the best for compression tube.\n\nHere is a good web page on airgun accuracy and maintenance.\n\n[URL]http://air_guns.tripod.com/accuracy.htm[/URL]\n\n[I][U]I am happy with my purchase and would like to thank everyone, especially Dr. Hanif, Moawia and Hafiz Abrar Sb !!\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5726[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]5794[/ATTACH][/U][/I]', 1, 0, '115.167.87.54', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Webley &amp; Scott - SxS 12g (English, old/new)  and Where can I find one in Peshawar or Rawalpindi?[/QUOTE]\n\nThe English Shotguns are divided in two basic categories, the Side lock and the Box lock. The Side locks are about 4 times or more expansive than a Box lock of the same make.\n\n Then there are a number of Box lock Models specially by Westley Richards which have varying quality and hence price. A Westley Richards Box lock with Drop Locks is actually just as expansive as its Sidelock and in fact more sought out. \n\nOver here the main thing is to see if the lugs have been repaired and what is the condition of the shotgun,  these days people buy beat up guns have barrels made in Darra and after filling the lugs fill up with metal or by Argon welding  then file it to shape  to tighten the gun which was rattling badly due to use and abuse.\n \nThe original mid rib with the writing is used and a new stock with beautiful walnut is made is made for it.\n \nThere are a few mechanics in Darra specialising in it and have very senior and educated fraudsters who help them and then sell these guns. \n\nTo catch a re built shotgun see the following; If the gun is original and in very good condition it will speak for itself. How ever if the gun is an old one with shiny barrel , the barrels are desi.\n\n English guns show corrosion due to mercuric primers of the 60s. The Proof marks when viewed with a magnifying glass will be obviously forged and larger than these should be.\n \nWhen you dis assemble the gun and view the lugs or lumps you will see a half moon from the sides. This is where the gun was repaired and will start to rattle again within a 100 shots.\n \nThe Firing pins, hammers and inetrnal parts are all desi and some times abbreviations are stamped on these to give an authentic look. \nSome times  they even use cheap Spanish makes like Kestrel and Spanish Churchill side locks and write English makers names; but some how an experienced person can always catch these by observing keenly. \n\nThe stocks are more beautiful than most English guns  have as we have the best and most beautiful walnut. \n\nThe engraving is nothing but a repitition of commas; I am told the engraver Umer Gul has improved, Jameel is the stock maker and Repairer. \n\nMistry Akram at Baksh Illahi Lahore is a very nice and honourable person; always show him a gun and he can tell you all about the gun you want to buy. \n\nThere are experienced persons  who can help you buy a used  English gun. There are still some virtually brand new English shotguns available but these command a lot of well deserved price. I have seen some brand new Webley&Scotts for about 250,000/- and also fakes which the seller always claims was presented to his father by Liaqat Ali Khan or the Viceroy which is all bullshit. \n\nA Westley Richards gun in new condition is worth buying at any price. Like from 8 lacs to 10 a Holland with self opener and a Royal Deluxe would be cheap at around two million and can be worth  4 million if in new condition with high grade engraving.\n\n The guns are there and show up for sale now and then  always with a sad story; A widow of some gentleman or a spoilt son of some gentleman who wants a "Panj Satti " an auto 5 shot and some money by selling his late father''s soul and dream gun.', 1, 1, '58.27.204.155', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am equally at ease in talking to an illiterate who makes a living by farming as I have also framed. I learned to drive a big Caterpillar tractor before I leaned to drive a car. I teach farmers in BWP how to determine the output of their tube wells without any fancy equipment. One farmer told me that the monument (stone marker) of one of his kila (acre) corner was missing. On that visit I had a GPS with me.  I set out to solve the farmer''s problem. Working three days and two night I had a solution. Now one can take me out blindfolded anywhere in Bahawalpur District. With the GPS in hand and my pre-calculations, I can tell you the block number, sub-block number, kila number and the distance to all four corners of that kila from that spot where I stand. All this knowledge came about when that illiterate farmer told of his missing kila marker. \n\nI am the son of a one-time patwari who wrote "Atalik Patwar" which was first published in 1941 in Lahore.

Why do so many people like this diminutive cartridge? Perhaps it for the same reason that common human instinct calls for backing up the underdog - the little guy.  Psychologist may be able to shed some light on such behavior. For those of us that have had this 22LR kinship, it was love at first sight with the first experience.\n \nTo be Number One in anything, it has to be exceptional. And, the 22LR is exceptional. Unlike the center-fire cartridge the 22LR can let you enjoy shooting for a longer period without worrying about your pocketbook. You can hone your shooting skills with the 22LR and deploy that confidence when you take out your big caliber rifle. Here is my often-repeated suggestion. If you have multiple guns and a 22LR is not in your collection, unload (meaning sell) one and with the proceeds buy a 22LR and still have money left over to buy lots of 22LR ammo. You don&#8217;t have to get a new rifle. Get a &#8220;clean&#8221; used one. Some that don&#8217;t look cosmetically clean can turn out to be excellent performers and excellent buys. If the 22LR is going to your first and only firearm acquisition - take along a gun nut friend with you when you are ready to buy one. He can lead you away from the ones that look nice and fancy but perform poorly.\n \nCome and join us.

It reduces Lead Dust in the barrel which causes inaccuracy and also lubes seal and cylinder wall with teflon, maintains piston speed. Fire 10 dry pellets and u r good for a year.

When an air gun is fired air temp inside the cylinder may rise upto 2,000 degrees but only for a fraction of second.. therefore any oil residue is burnt up. but when u have the spring changed u may want to clean the entire compression tube using a cloth tied to a long brush or plastic rod.. break a plastic hangar or use a piece of wood. long screw driver should be avoided as it may scratch the cylinder walls. nothing abrasive should touch the cylinder wall. recommended lube for piston is Moly Grease also called MOS2 (molybdenum di sulphide). Clean piston and apply light Moly to the seal.. anything else will quickly burn up and is useless. \n\nDue to our dusty and moist environment before storing ur airgun always lube the barrel and cover its exposed/open end with a plastic bag to avoid moisture and or dust creeping in.

Usually, longer barrel rifles have a larger sight radius - but not always. Many modern manufacturers limit the iron sight radius in order to have reasonable space on top of the receiver and portion of the rear end of barrel to accommodate a telescopic sight so as to clear the rear iron sight from the objective lens of a riflescope, if one is to be installed.\n \nHere a way to visualize how the length of the barrel and sight radius impacts the &#8220;sighting&#8221; of the target in the horizontal plane. Let us say that the rifle is mounted at a point where the chamber and the rear end of the barrel meet. The mounting is on fixed plate that can only be rotated in horizontal plane. The radius of the plate is as large as the length of the barrel. The longer the barrel - the larger is the radius of the plate. The outer edge of the smaller plate may only be able to accommodate markings perhaps at just one- degree intervals. Larger plate may be able to perhaps accommodate one-degree minute markings. With an even larger plate resolution of the markings may be in degree, minute and second markings or even more refined.\n \nThe subject is very simple - larger sight gives better angular resolution in the vertical plane than a shorter sight radius. The same holds true for rear iron sight that adjusts the elevation. The larger the sight radius, the better the resolution of the rear sight markings. With a larger sight radius and larger number of rear markings, each vertical rear sight mark will make the target adjustment in the vertical plane more refined.\n \nThe above discussion is applicable to all rifles and pistols of any caliber with iron sights.', 1, 1, '75.140.11.190', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Proofing is performed to stress the rifle chamber and the barrel under higher than standard pressures as set by SAAMI (Sporting Arms & Ammunition Manufacturer Institute) a body that sets standards. This is done to ascertain that the chamber and the  barrel retain intergrity. Maximum recommended pressure for 22LR is 24,000 PSI (pounds per square inch).  Overload cartridges are prepared with extra propellant for test purposes. In some cases, like in .50 BMG - Browning Machine Gun, the extra pressure is attained by using a heavier bullet than the standard/normal weight bullet. With a standard/normal weight of propellant in the cartridge, the heavier bullet is slower to move from the chamber and through the barrel - thus creating higher pressure for testing and proofing purposes.  \n\nFor comparison here are some other maximum pressure recommendation by SAAMI: 30-06, 61,000 PSI; 300 Winchester Magnum, 64,000 PSI; 270 Winchester, 22-250, 300 Remington Ultra Magnum, 375 Remington Ultra Magnum, 300 Weatherby Magnum 65,000 PSI.\n\nI hope this answer your remaining question.', 1, 1, '75.140.11.190', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Increasing the LOP on a synthetic hollow stock (of any shotgun) is a real b^^ch. some creative problem solving is required because the recoil pad fits into the hollow cavity of the stock. so a stock spacer will have to be designed in such as way that it partially fits inside the hollow cavity (one side) and the recoil pad has to in the hollow cavity (other side). the spacer will also have a collar machined around its edges to prevent it from going all way inside the stock under recoil.\r\n\r\n[B]Slip-on Recoil Pad:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.chuckhawks.com/sims_limbsaver_slip-on.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nthe easiest that I can think so far is a slip-on recoil pad. it might not be a perfect solution but it will save you from the trouble of designing a stock spacer. plus if things don''t work out, you can always take it off. the downside is a slight chance shifting of the slip-on recoil pad during recoil. the stock spacer is geared towards a person with a long term fix in mind.\r\n\r\n[B]Stock Spacer:[/B]\r\n\r\nThe stock spacer was made for a Baikal MP-153. It was later taken off as I realized that Ideal measurements are not always practical. :)\r\n\r\nThe spacer is made out of polypropylene. very soft (to touch) and durable polymer material. it is spray painted (matt-black) to match synthetic Baikal MP-153''s furniture.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011197.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011198.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011200.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011202.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011203.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011204.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.43.73', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0);

Proofing is performed to stress the rifle chamber and the barrel under higher than standard pressures as set by SAAMI (Sporting Arms & Ammunition Manufacturer Institute) a body that sets standards. This is done to ascertain that the chamber and the  barrel retain intergrity. Maximum recommended pressure for 22LR is 24,000 PSI (pounds per square inch).  Overload cartridges are prepared with extra propellant for test purposes. In some cases, like in .50 BMG - Browning Machine Gun, the extra pressure is attained by using a heavier bullet than the standard/normal weight bullet. With a standard/normal weight of propellant in the cartridge, the heavier bullet is slower to move from the chamber and through the barrel - thus creating higher pressure for testing and proofing purposes.  \n\nFor comparison here are some other maximum pressure recommendation by SAAMI: 30-06, 61,0000 PSI; 300 Winchester Magnum, 64,00 PSI; 270 Winchester, 22-250, 300 Remington Ultra Magnum, 375 Remington Ultra Magnum, 300 Weatherby Magnum 65,000 PSI.\n\nI hope this answer your remaining question.[/QUOTE]\nTyping error . 30-06 > 61000 PSI and 300 Win Mag 64000 PSI', 1, 1, '58.27.144.192', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The river slopes from the source to the mouth vary strongly, with the steepest part, about 25 m/Km upstream of Tandi. \r\n\r\nFrom Tandi to Akhnoor the slop is 5m/Km and it drops to \r\nabout 0.4 m/km when the river flows out into the plains. Below Akhnoor it becomes wider and the flood plain is enormous. \r\n\r\nDownstream of Marala the river width varies from 700 to 1400 m whereas the flood plain is about ten times as wide as the river.', 1, 1, '110.36.31.181', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The river basin measures 67515 km\nThe source of Chenab is at 77°- 30° E and 32°-50° N and lays in Lahul and Spite district in Himachal Pradesh India. \n\nThe river forms at the confluence of the two streams called “Bhaga” \nand “Chandara” which flow along the Baralcha pass at an elevation of 5,000 M and join at a place called Tandi in Jammu and Kashmir State (India). \nBesides Bhaga and Chandra, Bhut nullah and Manu also enter the river from right above Salal Dam. \n\nChenab is joined near the boarder by two major tributaries, the Munwar Tawi and Jammu Tawi both draining some 2,800 Km of land on both side of the two rivers.\nChenab enters Pakistan just upstream of rim station Marala (32°- 40N and 76°-29E). The total catchment area upstream of Marala is nearly \n28,000 Km\n\nThe distance from Marala Barrage to confluence point with Indus river at Mithankot is 598 Km. The river slopes from the source to the mouth vary strongly, with the steepest part, about 25 m/Km upstream of Tandi. \n\nFrom Tandi to Akhnoor the slop is 5m/Km and it drops to \nabout 0.4 m/km when the river flows out into the plains. Below Akhnoor it becomes wider and the flood plain is enormous. \n\nDownstream of Marala the river width varies from 700 to 1400 m whereas the flood plain is about ten times as wide as the river.[/QUOTE]\n@ TR\n\nMan, do u want to say that the mighty INDUS is inferior to Chenab river by any means? \n\nNO NO NO … Sir, please.  \nDoubtlessly, the Indus flyway (Green Route) is something mammoth comparing the rest of the rivers, by all manners.

Also, avoid the cheap Pathan dealers, as to avert a second hand purchase, and they might even have a lower price for it, as to lure. Purchase from the more established ones as I''ve mentioned above, and preferably from a guy who can put forth some 3-4 boxes before you as to choose, and never show interest in any specific one, ask for the prices of all first ( There may be different tags for older version/railed version/black/two-tone, etc).

The 1911 of any manufacturer will fire all kinds of ball ammo without any hitches. It''s the specialty ammo (like JHP''s) which gives the 1911 problems. The issue lies with the 1911''s extractor. Custom 1911''s, like Taurus or Kimber or Dan Wesson, have modified extractors to facilitate specialty ammo and so function without any problems most of the time. It''s usually advised not to use a full-loaded mag with a 1911 before it''s been broken in. Other .45 ACP pistols, like the Taurus 845, do not have such stoppage problems like the 1911. I''m sure the seniors and 1911-owners here will be able to better elaborate and clarify.\n\nThe 1911 is, IMHO despite being a 100-year old design, a flawless pistol that continues to do what it was designed to do: Fire military-grade ball ammo. Under most circumstances, a broken-in 1911 packing ball ammo is enough to cope with any SD/HD situations.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nDear friends, I''d like to interject, if I may. I use an NP44 for SD/HD and CC (:p however much of that''s possible) and I went into a cold sweat my gun FTEd the very first round!!! One of the main reasons is that the gun doesn''t have a feed ramp - polished or otherwise - so the very first round (now listen to this.....!) was a Serbian SJHP ! So, to add to the misery of not having a feed ramp, a SOFT-NOSED round was bein fed into the chamber ! This was but to be expected, one of the range gurus Raza Tareen informed me! \n\nThat REALLY got me into action and I subsequently fired 200 rounds through the iniquitous weapon and lo and behold! I can fire shrapnel through it now without a hitch! But let me qualify that. These Serbian .45acp rounds have pathetic casing. they dent at the drop of a hat. Probably, therefore, they loosen at the seat and sometimes the round will easily come out of the casing. No other round that I know of does this, but a 185-grain .45acp SJHP is VERY bad news for ANY bad guy! \n\nThirdly, the NP44''s magazines are nothing to write home about unless you are one very lucky individual and good mags with your gun. \n\nI hope i''ve helped.', 1, 0, '175.110.4.33', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

From the moment the trigger is pulled and the bullet enter the rifle bore it starts to spin. Initially the bullet is in line with the bore. As soon as it leaves the barrel, gravity takes over and the bullet is no longer traveling in a straight line; it starts to head down range toward the ground. The bullet is being twisted or torqued to the right. This rotation gives the bullet a push in a 90 degrees direction from the rotation. In physics this twist or torque called the gyroscopic effect or drift. This drift for a typical 7.62 mm projectile is about 10 inches (9.5-10 inches) at 1,000 yards. This drift equates to about one minute of angle (MOA) at the given distance. One MOA is close to 10.47 inches at 1,000 yards. For a right hand twist the drift is to the right. For left hand twist the drift is the same but to the left. Long-range shooters understand this drift.\n \nThe earth’s spin causes acceleration which in physics is called the Coriolis effect or drift. The Coriolis drift has two parts - one in the horizontal plane and another in the vertical plane. The amount of horizontal drift is dependant on the firing distance above or below the equator. This effect is zero at the equator and approaches maximum toward the poles. A conventional 7.62 mm projectile fired from Aquitaine, France (location - exactly 45 degrees above the equator) will drift about 2.5-3.0 inches to the right at 1,000 yards.\n \nThe Coriolis vertical drift depends on two factors - the direction of fire and the location of fire on the earth. Maximum vertical drift is at the equator. Firing eastward will result in projectile hitting high. Firing westward will result in projectile hitting low. A 7.62 mm projectile fired eastward from, Acquitaine, France, will have vertical drift resulting in impact 2.5-3 inches high at 1,000 yards. Shooting westward, the projectile will hit 2.5-3 inches low at the same distance. Firing north or south will have no vertical drift.\n \nGyroscopic drift and Coriolis drift are not related to each other but act independent of each other. Combining the two drifts determines the overall effect. In practice the shooter makes sight adjustments to compensate for the mentioned drifts. For the northern hemisphere shooter, left twist rifling can compensate for the gyroscopic drift. From long ingrained old habits, manufacturers keep churning out right twist barrels. For scientific reasons the need is for left hand twist rifling as majority shooters live north of the equator.\n \nNot everyone in this hobby is a long range shooter. All the same, an avid shooter want to know how the rifling twist direction effects a projectile. He also wants to know how his direction of fire and the distance from the equator influences the fired projectile. Such knowledge in our hobby need not be held like a family secret. The sole purpose of this site is to share such knowledge with each other.', 1, 1, '75.140.11.190', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I liked both air guns. One of my cousins at that time had a bolt action 22LR. I tried his rifle and like it. As time passed, both of my air guns wore out from very heavy use. At that time they could not be repaired in Bahawalpur. When the time came for replacement, I was given a bolt action 22LR. I can recall the brand name of my air guns but for the life of me I can not recall the brand name of the 22LR rifle. I do remember that it was made in Czechoslovakia. Perhaps it was a BRNO.\n \nOver lifetime I have had many different center fire caliber rifles. My interest in those calibers peaked and waned. But, the fascination and love of the 222LR never left me. To this day it is still in me and with me.[/QUOTE]\nI love the way you have described your youth... and the area sounds familiar.', 1, 1, '119.73.13.130', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

There are reasons why it is known as the Number One. \n \nIt is the cheapest brass cartridge available. It delivers almost no recoil to the shoulder. With reasonable marksmanship, it is effect up to 100 yards on small game. If later you acquire big caliber rifle, the 22LR will still serve you well. When big game season is over and you have to wait for following big game season - you can keep honing your shooting skills with the 22LR at minimal cost. The 22LR will be like your best buddy - always ready for you. Don’t forget, with a 22LR rifle your immediate and extended family members can enjoy this sport with you .\n \nYou need not spend a ton of money to get a decent 22LR rifle. You don''t have to buy a new one. There are many fine used 22LR rifles available at reasonable prices. If you have relatives or friends in this hobby, ask their assistance in keeping an eye open for a “good buy” for your need. If no one around you is in this hobby, ask member here for help. As a newcomer, members will go out of their way to assist you.\n \nNo doubt you will be excited when you get your 22LR rifle. I will be just as excited to hear from you that you acquired one.

All this, whilst saving Rs. 125K''s( Glock, 350K''s), which you again could invest in getting some accessories imported, if need be. You''ll never forget the "feel" of holding a Steyr in your hands.\n\nI''m placing the Glock in third position, because it is severely over-priced and because I personally do not feel ease of controlling it, due to the aggressive grip texture.\n\nFinally, I''m placing the Caracal at the bottom, coz it''s still a new item, with lots to establish yet.

Antique piece are priceless...\n\n"The [B]MAB model D[/B] is a [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol"]pistol[/URL]  produced by MAB (Manufacture d''Armes de Bayonne) from 1933 to 1963 (.32  ACP) and 1982 (.380 ACP); it was inspired by the Belgian Browning [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_model_1910"]FN pistol 1910/22[/URL].  It was developed with the smaller "MAB C," also made in .32 and .380  ACP, and with which it has many parts in common. Some later examples  marked "MAB C" are actually a combination of a MAB C "slide" and barrel  with a MAB D frame; these are officially an "extended grip" MAB C but  usually called a "MAB C/D," although are not so marked. The MAB C was  primarily a civilian "pocket pistol," while the larger MAB D was  intended for police and military use.\n\n The MAB D was used by the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"]French[/URL] Army and [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_police"]military police[/URL] before and after World War II. After German forces occupied France, the MAB D was adopted for use by the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht"]Wehrmacht[/URL] (German army) during [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"]World War II[/URL];  these pistols typically have German acceptance marks stamped into the  metal. (As with other weapons, it is not uncommon to find forged German  acceptance marks on MAB Ds being sold, including incorrect acceptance  marks, incorrect placement, and marks on Type II MABs not manufactured  until after World War II.)\n Following World War II, the MAB D was used by the French military in  Indochina. In France, it was used by various French governmental  agencies, including the French local police, the "Gendarmerie" (national  police), the customs department, the "National Forest Office" and by  the "Banque de France". MAB Ds are now only used as surplus pistols for  the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Police"]French Police[/URL],  who primarily used revolvers before 2000. As with other French  firearms, MAB Ds were also used by the military and police of the  Kingdom of Morocco, a French protectorate. In the years after World War  II, German police forces also used the MAB D.\n\n There were two MAD D versions, usually called the Type I and Type II.  The Type I MAB D was made 1933-1945 and used an external muzzle bushing  release latch in front of the trigger guard; the Type II used an  internal "bayonet" type release requiring pushing in and turning the  muzzle bushing. The MAB factory changed from the Type I to Type II  production in June 1945."\n\nAnother informative link for your consideration and Serial number checking.\n\n[url]http://forums.gunboards.com/showthread.php?60762-MAB-model-D-serial-number[/url]', 1, 0, '113.203.129.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The 6.5mm Remington Magnum is based on the 350 Remington Magnum case, the only difference being in the caliber reduction. The Remington Model 600 carbine had an 18 1/2-inch barrel and the later 660 carbine a 20-inch barrel. Neither of these carbines allowed the cartridge to develop its full velocity potential and both were discontinued. By 1971, only the Remington Model 700 and 40-XB target rifle with 24-inch barrels were cataloged as available in 6.5mm Magnum caliber. for a short time, the Ruger Model 77 was offered in this caliber. At the present time, no one offers rifles chambered for the 6.5mm Remington Magnum, although Remington still loads the ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe 6.5mm Remington Magnum has greater case capacity and develops higher velocity than any of the European 6.5s. It is actually an excellent cartridge for North American big game hunting and can also double as a varmint cartridge by handloading the lighter bullets of 87 to 100 grains. Probably one reason it never achieved great popularity was because of the rifles it was offered in, which were not very appealing designs, and their short magazines required deep seating of the heavier bullets with a consequent loss in powder capacity and performance. Combined with the short barrels of the Remington Model 600 and 660 carbines, this added up to ballistics well below the 30-06 class of cartridges. In a standard action that will allow seating the heavier bullets farther out, one can nearly approach the performance of the 270 Winchester. With the proper bullet, the 6.5mm Magnum is adequate for almost any North American big game at moderate to long ranges under normal hunting conditions. Unfortunately, this is another case of a basically good cartridge that didn''t catch on. At one time, Remington offered two bullet weights, a 100-grain bullet at an advertised muzzle velocity of 3450 fps and a 120-grain bullet at 3220 fps. The older 6.5mm cartridges gained their reputation as good killers with the heavier bullets of 140 to 160 grains, and the lack of such a factory load is very likely another reason for the demise of the Remington version. Maximum performance is delivered by 4350, 4831 and H450 powders, in this cartridge, particularly with heavy bullets.', 1, 0, '113.203.151.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In other words we want our results on target to be same again and again. This factor of repeatability is the one that gives us accuracy. Let us look at our shooting process and see how some of the variations can show up on the target.\n \nThe rifle - You had test fired the rifle some time back and have proof on paper showing excellent results. Since then how much have you used that rifle? If you have used it a lot, can you say in all honesty that the current condition of the rifle is the same when you tested it on paper target? Perhaps, not.  Since then you may have propellant residue build-up in the chamber and the barrel. What assurance you have that that the rifle sight (iron or optical) has not been disturbed by mishandling since you did your testing?\n \nThe ammunition - Are you using the same ammunition that you used when you test fired the rifle? Is the ammunition from the same box? If not from the box, but another box, is the batch number on the ammunition box you are using now the same as the one that was imprinted on the test fire ammunition box? If the ammo is from the same box or from the same batch, has ammo you are using now been stored properly? Proper storage calls for low humidity and in mild temperature swings. If bought your ammunition one or more years ago, have you stored the ammunition where large swings of humidity and/or temperature took place? If the answer is yes, your ammunition may not behave the same as it did when you tested it sometime back. In an area like Punjab, seasonal temperature swings of about 40-45 centigrade are not uncommon. In the monsoon season, high humidity and high temperature conditions are also not uncommon.\n \nLet us assume the condition of the rifle and the ammunition is the same. What was the season and the weather condition when your rifle was tested? Is the current season and weather condition for shooting the same as when you test fired the rifle? If not, your “test bed” - the rifle-ammo-season-weather” combination is not he same.

Excellent share above.\n\nMay I just say, this is the way to boom one''s potential up for the gross benefit of the GDP, the way the Turk government promoted the skills of their technical faculty available, in setting up kind of small firearms industries all around the country and gave them the kind of "vendor" status of supplying parts and components to the main manufacturers - or may I say "assemblers" - who then assemble the quality manufactured items - [I]made according to individually specified requirements [/I]- and then move on to export these delights to us for the further joy.\n\nI feel this is an example that should long ago have been followed over here, if our government could have utilized the skills of our Darra region and helped those people in setting up small manufacturing units with the state of the art equipment.[COLOR=#0000cd] This would also have ridden illegal firearms to a great extent[/COLOR].\n\nI think, what you missed discussing with the Turks, or perhaps just forgot to include in your post above, that all firearms for export are then passed on to another authority like MKEK, which does the final passing of the quality standards before export permission is giving and items [I]serialized[/I]. It''s an absolutely unique set up.\n\nFinally, I feel we should discuss with some of the more popular importers over here, to get us some of the more desired Turkish items, that they somehow still haven''t pondered on to import. An example is the Sarsilmaz Rifled barrel slug autoloader, a couple of great handguns by Sarsilmaz, like the 14 shots K-45, probably also the SC model in Stoeger Cougar, which also could fill a major gap over here in reliable CC.\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '119.153.130.148', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The three men are charged with using single import licences of civil officials and members of sensitive agencies to execute the scheme.\nThese charges are contained in a letter sent to federal interior and commerce secretaries, chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), DG ISI, DG FIA and IG Police Punjab by one who called himself &#8216;well-wisher of Pakistan&#8217;. The Lahore customs collector is also alleged to have used his subordinate staff to harass the business rivals of Diyal in order to extract bribes running into millions of rupees.\n\nThe letter says Abbasi also used his influence to shield from prosecution his brother implicated in the smuggling case of 28kg of gold.  It goes on to allege that Abbasi, acting in tandem with his unannounced business partners, used the single import licences issued by the commerce ministry to officials of sensitive agencies for semi-automatic weapons to import lethal automatic weapons and then sell them in the open market.\n\nWhen Abbasi was contacted to get his version of the story, he called the allegations baseless and requested that these not be publicised.  Ex-MNA Ejaz Diyal pleaded ignorance about any such letter or weapons import.

If you want to punch holes in papers, the 22 magnum can go to 100-125-150 yards and 22 the Hornet to 200-250-275 yards. \n \nIf you want to hunt, then you need to state the intended game. Sure, 22 Hornet can outdo the 22 magnum on paper and in the field. Say, you want to hunt rabbits at a reasonable distance. The 22 magnum may kill at that distance but 22 Hornet may damage a good part of the rabbit meat. It may be ok for small boars, but bigger ones may require more "horsepower" from the barrel than the 22 Hornet can deliver.\n \nThe &#8220;22 Hornet&#8221; thread in the Ammunition Forum that Abbas started on October 31, 2011 is very informative. You will find many posts in that thread outlining features and comparisons. There, beside the 22 magnum and 22 Hornet, many other calibers are mentioned. In post #11 of that thread, Abbas gives cost comparisons.  The 22 magnum is cheaper to shoot. But, if you are thinking of 22Hornet, why not also consider 223 as the shooting cost is essentially the same. But 223 can do a lot more than the 22 Hornet.\n\nIf mind to buy is already set on the rifle make/model you mentioned and it is only available in 22LR and 22 Hornet, then you need to answer the initial question for yourself - the intended use and the distance in mind. You may want do some more thinking before pulling the money out of your pocket and handing it to the gun dealer.

I am a DIY car enthusiast so it was just a walk in the park for me.\nTime required - 6 hours Approx. (would have be quicker if I did not have to go to a Lathe Shop).\n\nAfter say 800 shots, was not happy with the spring and the twang it makes when cocking and phanch sound when it fires, so i thought about replacing it myself. Though I won''t complain on power, it still was firing quite nice. I had a spare Diana 45 Spring that i got from air rifle headquarters. h[URL="http://www.airrifleheadquarters.com/catalog/item/251488/8070882.htm"]ttp://www.airrifleheadquarters.com/catalog/item/251488/8070882.htm[/URL] for 17$. Had chat with Moawia before buying Rainbow and he said it will fit. The spring is 34 coils with heavier 3.25mm wire. Already using another one in my Diana 45 for some years and it shoots consistently.\n\n[B]1st Step.[/B] Building the spring compression rig cuz main spring is under compression and there is no way you can compress it with bare hands. Got hold of 36" x 5" x 2" piece of wood. Cut two 03 inch sections using my electric jig saw to be used for ends. 36 inch minus 06 inch (2 end sections) gave me total length of 30 inches of wood. With the end sections mounted on base, effective internal length comes to 24 inches. Iron nails do not have the strength to hold these sections in place when under spring tension so I used Gimsa Adhesive (Rs. 50 bottle kinda elfy but bottle is bigger) before nailing in the end pieces. Oh i need a screwable compressing tool... So i used Honda Scissor Jack !! Clever Idea huh. If you are my type, do it yourself kinda guy, be very careful, [B]any slips may injure you[/B]. Holes on the rig are for 02 pins. \n\n2. Unscrew stock screws. Two on the sides and one thicker minus screw on the bottom (trigger guard front screw). Also remove rear sights.\n\n3. Remove the barrel lock screw then the barrel screw to remove the barrel and the cocking arm. Surprised to see cocking arm is a single unit unlike diana 45 where cocking arm goes into the cocking shoe. Holy cow there are no washers on the sides of barrel, seems like the manufacturer forgot to add those during assembly. Went to a lathe shop to have these made from metal washers. After reassembly barrel movement has become so much smoother than before. \n\n4. Place the compression tube on the rig and screw in the scissor jack till u achieve some tension. U may need a few big washers (big enough in diameter but should go inside the compression tube rather than the tube edges - may also use a piece of plastic pipe) on jack face. Exerting some pressure eases removal of pins. Gently tap 2nd last pin on the compression tube with rubber hammer and a flat faced iron nail (filed a 5 inch iron nail to get rid of its pointed tip). This will free the trigger.. remove it with care as u do not want to lose the trigger spring.\n\n5. Now remove the last pin. Be careful u r abt to experience spring tension. Holes on the rig that I had made prior to pin removal made it easier to collect pins in the pocket.\n\n6. Inspected piston and its leather seal. Hmmm. Requires some tuning. The seal is held in place with a screw (minus head) with plastic washer in the front and the rear of the piston. \n\n[B]Preparing the front piston seal washer for a tighter piston seal:[/B]\nI noticed the front plastic washer is responsible for how closely the leather seal grips on the cylinder wall and there was some space between the leather and the front plastic washer. Front seal washer sits inside the leather seal and its walls restrict leather seal pressing on the piston.  hmmm. Loose seal. Washed the front washer with petrol to remove any grease on it. Wrapped the edges with abro 1 inch paper tape (around 10 wraps) to achieve roughly 2 mm increase in diameter. Used scissor to cut of excesss tape. Applied elfy on the paper tape. Paper tape absorbs elfy and makes it as hard as plastic. With this i increased diameter of the front seal washer so as to ensure leather seal will grip tighter on the cylinder walls. Applied thin layer of depoxy on the front and rear let it dry. Filed off excess depoxy to give it a nice smooth finish. Depoxy can withstand heat much better than elfy so this light coating will help durability. \n\nCleaned the entire barrel using rolled piece of cloth. Goodness, it had metal filings inside the compression tube. The piston although very sturdy in construction but had a few rough edges. Filed those off, perhaps these metal filings in the compression tube had caused it. \n\nHad run out of spring tar so i used 3M White Grease (Lithium) on the spring and the piston behind the seal. 3M White lithium grease comes in a spray can and forms a pretty heavy slippery layer when it dries up. Ideal for lubricating metal to metal contact.\n\nApplied some silicone oil (also available at Tread Mill Shops) on the piston seal. With increase in piston seal diameter it was a bit difficult to get it inside the compression tube but it made me smile :) cuz i know it will improve compression. Once piston was in, sprayed more 3M Lithium grease inside the compression tube on the walls.  \n\nReassembled the entire gun in reverse order with a few shots of 3M White Grease on barrel washers and screw. Fired a few shots, it is a much refined airgun now but initially experienced loss in power due to tighter piston seal :). After say 30 shots it is as smooth as butter. No spring twang on cocking nor a phanch on firing, smoother barrel movement and greater cocking effort required with this new spring. [I]You may measure cocking effort by placing barrel on a house hold weighing scale (that you use for weighing yourself) and pressing the stock in an attempt to cock the airgun. This is not extremely accurate but gives a general idea of cocking effort. With previous spring i measured around 26 Lbs cocking effort. With new spring it is around 35 lbs. Let me also add that barrel now has washers therefore there is less resistance on barrel movement. This simple test with new spring and repeating it after several thousands shots shows you what condition is your mainspring. Reduced cocking effort = reduced power. [/I]\n\n[I][B]Love the heavier sound of a powerful airgun with a greater recoil ofcourse !!. \n[/B][/I]\nRecoil reminds me that I have also drilled a small hole just 2mm on the dove tail to restrict scope movement. \n\nSorry guyz I know I should have taken pictures of the entire process but greasy hands restricted my access to a camera !!\n\n[B]Disclaimer: If you want to tune your Rainbow 35 , [U]DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. There is a great risk of injury and or damaging the gun if you do not know what you are doing. Above Average Mechanical Expertise Required.

Interesting features and development however I would advise against trading in your MP-153s in favor of MP-155s. At least for now. Here is why:\r\n\r\n[B]Certain features really tickle my fancy:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. No more adjustable gas system (self regulating only)\r\nno more fiddling around with a very moody (and times quiet frustrating) feature of the MP-153. the system will automatically adjust to any load it is being subjected to. Kinda Cool.\r\n\r\n2. Ability to use shims to change cast and length of comb\r\nNow this is certainly interesting. a good gun fit makes one hell of a difference in the way you shoot.\r\n\r\n3. Dovetail milled on the receiver (to install a variety of sighting systems)\r\ncool feature for somebody who want to shoot slugs. a definite plus.\r\n\r\n4. Improved controls (better shaped trigger guard, mag cut-off)\r\nI kinda liked the shape of the trigger guard. mag cut-off is pretty nice as well. at times you really dont want to cycle through every cartridge just to empty the magazine. plus it gives you the option of sudden load change given the situation (hunting).\r\n\r\n5. Reduced weight\r\na big time plus\r\n\r\n[B]Things that concern me:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. New design with no history or track record\r\nwith every new product , there are bugs and issues. some of them are caught during designing, some during prototyping phase and some during serial production phase however others (the really nasty ones) reveal themselves only after years of continuous use. in short, you need some time before you can conclusively say that all kinks have been worked out. in other words: it takes a few years before a manufacturer gets everything right in a product.\r\n\r\n2. Probable design flaws that might need tweaking\r\nif you recall the history of Baikal MP-153, uptil 2005, it was plagued with a variety of issues ranging from durability to reliability and pattern performance. infact, if you compare your 2006 (or later) Baikal to a 2005 (or earlier) Baikal you will find striking differences in the shape of the barrel thread (choke system), cartridge elevator (design and shape) and bolt handle(more likely a cosmetic change only).\r\n\r\n3. No more adjustable gas system (self regulating only)\r\nThis is either a good thing or a bad thing. however given the quality and inconsistency of locally manufactured cartridges I am more comfortable with a system which I can fiddle with or adjust.\r\n\r\n[B]To Summarize:[/B]\r\n\r\nI would say that you hold on to your Baikal MP-153s for now. why? cause this new MP-155 still has a long way to go before it proves itself worthy to be called a Baikal shotgun. Something synonymous with hell and back reliability and tank like durability.\r\n\r\nRegards', 1, 1, '182.177.124.171', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I was not able to shoot the partridges in the proper way so my dad said you should get a GWARCH and hunt in a close range or monitor how the partridges move so you can see how to hunt them. I mostly used to monitor there movement and enjoy rather then hunting them. I saw the GWARCH making in front of me. Its very Simple. Take a Good piece of cloth which you think you can hide your front from it. Take Skins of the Wild Bushes, ( Chegird or Chish in balochi). The skins of this Wild bushes give a AKHROAT type color when u put them in water. Put the Cloth and these Bush Skins together to Color the Cloth. Believe me, the Output is a perfect Camouflage for upland. make a hole for your Eyes and another for your Gun and Aiming.   \n\n\nI dont enjoy the hunting with this GWARCH, but the most enjoying part is, Go without a Gun and Just watch the partridges in there Mood :)[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks Brother For sharing nice information.', 1, 1, '119.152.44.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The sear cage and decocker assemble pops open, and requires a lot of patience, skill, and patience again, to re-assemble.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the weapon I was modifying was NIB, had very tight springs and pin-holes. This meant I had to go the conventional way, let everything pop open instead of pushing longer sear pin out with a shorter slave pin. For those not aware of CZ P01 design, the sear cage pin holds the sear cage in the frame, as well as 3 different springs, sear, firing pin lifting block lever, and decocker assembly. One single pin goes through all these parts, and in the frame. A shorter slave pin will retain all the parts, while remove the sear cage from the frame to get to the hammer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U]SEQUENCE[/U]\r\n-Field strip\r\n-Remove grips\r\n-Remove main spring retaining plug and mag brake. This will lead to main spring popping out. This part can also be done after removing sear cage.\r\n-Lift sear spring and remove decocking lever\r\n-Remove washer which retains the sear cage pin.\r\n-Push out the sear cage pin. The springs and other parts will literally fly out. Make sure you have them secured. If a slave pin were used, properly, you could have an intact sear cage coming out, no fuss.\r\n-Remove the hammer pin retaining pin, and then the hammer pin (yes, a lot of pins)\r\n-Hammer and disconnector are all yours to have now! The pins attaching the hammer and disconnector to the strut do take a lot, a lot, of beating to come out. They are very well staked. They will have to be replaced, so have them in spare beforehand.\r\n-Re-assemble in reverse order.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U]TOOLS[/U]\r\n-Punch (roll pin) 1/16", 3/32" , 1/8" \r\n\r\n-Polymer hammer for smacking in the sear cage pin\r\n\r\n-Starter punch kit\r\n\r\n-The handle of the hammers for pressing down the plug, or any thing that does not damage finish, and can be used to hold/push the plug inside.\r\n\r\n-Nose pliers\r\n\r\n-Spring hook kit (to fiddle with sear spring, decocker spring, hammer retaining pin, and decocker/sear-cage pin retaining washer)\r\n\r\n-Polymer pistol block\r\n\r\n-Slave pin for decocker assembly (almost impossible to reassemble without this)\r\n\r\n-No Third Hand this time, had to use both arms and both legs during the process.\r\n\r\n-Those looking for pictures, can have a look at the youtube videos, it was more or less what I did, although it looks pretty simple in the videos, is more difficult in real life...or was it just me! I did not touch the trigger group..\r\n\r\n\r\n[video=youtube;mSOY9OvLrBg]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSOY9OvLrBg[/video]\r\n\r\n[video=youtube;IOsojk4fJss]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOsojk4fJss[/video]\r\n\r\n[U]RESULT[/U]\r\nThe trigger break was 4.5 lbs after the modification, reduced from 5 lbs prior. I expect this to go down to 4 lbs in time, as the weapon was NIB still. There was no creep after the change in hammer. Absolutely no creep. Competition level SA break, very smooth. I have two offers for the weapon now, one of the proposers have only heard about this over the phone!\r\n\r\nAnd yes, some very very, very sore finger tips (and a couple of cuts as well), all taken care of by the satisfaction at the range!\r\n\r\nHave now fired exactly 100 rounds in two sessions, chinese red box, barnaul, s&b 124 grains, pof2z (original or not, they worked). All through without any sort of malfunction.\r\n\r\n[U]TOTAL MODIFICATIONS ON PISTOL[/U]\r\n-Competition hammer (looks exactly standard, but has a different hook profile, to give crisp, smooth and instant break. A matching disconnector was also installed.\r\n-Reduced power springs: main spring for DA pull (13 lbs, also helps in racking slide!), firing pin spring to ensure reliable ignition with weaker main spring, and firing pin lifting block (fplb) spring to reduce creep in pre-travel, as well as trigger weight. Can almost not feel the fplb.\r\n-Night Sights by Meprolight (good news is they were spot on in the first install, did not need to readjust at all by tapping them after shooting!)\r\n-Cocobolo full checkered wood grips by CZ.\r\n\r\nFresh and clear pics later, for the time being, below should suffice (to some extent)..\r\n\r\n[U]CAUTION[/U]\r\n-I did repeated function checks. One after reassembling the sear cage with slave pin. Then again after installing the sear cage in the frame. Both times with decocking lever installed. Repeatedly. Finally, function test after complete assembly of weapon. Slide racking, trigger reset, decocking function etc. I only loaded two rounds in first magazine at the range, just in case. They went fine. Next mag was five rounds.\r\n-I do not intend to do any decocking type weapon again.

I didn''t notice this before I cleaned the receiver.    The gun appears to operate correctly in that the trigger works fine, the gun breaks open fine and the safety works.   Is this normal?

For spring, i was compelled to order imported spring cuz the ones available in our country are unfortunately not up to the mark. \n\nMainspring is most critical for the power plant. Mettalurgy of wire is important and the wire needs to be cold rolled or else it loses its tension very quickly. When selecting air gun spring whether in pakistan or outside please give extra attention to the spring edges. Most springs show signs of heat (oxy aceytelene torch commonly called gas welding) on the edges. A coil even if it is cold rolled but any heat even on the edges (oxy aceytelene torch) destroys its ability to maintain its shape and tension after a few strokes (case with local springs). Closely inspect color changes on the spring coils especially on the ends to see signs of TORCH / Heat. Good luck with spring buying dude. \n\nIt is my habit and strongly advise to wait for the right parts before attempting any upgrade to avoid frequent dismantling. Plan, wait and do it right the very first time. Would have postponed assembly if i was stuck anywhere upto my satisfaction be it proper spring, piston seal or barrel side washers.

I shot and the dove flew away injured, cause my Rainbow''s spring was down after extensive shooting of just 1000 pellets or so. I was angry and returning back, not knowing of the bad luck awaiting on the other route where I thought I''d spot an occasional dove for a Sunday Broast...

The first shot with a heavy trigger pull like DA and subsequent shots are in SA ? \n\n* If revolver mode (DA) is selected then when we chamber the round, does the hammer remain cocked unless we decock it manually or it gets in decock position itself ?\n\nI am asking these questions because I dont have this pistol yet. Further my concern is about the magazine.\n\n*How much an original Zastava Extra Magazine cost ( or even its available or not) ?\n\n* The NIB is supplied with how many magazines ?\n\n* How much an altered magazine cost me as brother 12Gauge in a separate thread mentioned that we can alter easily an original/desi Beretta/SIG magazine for CZ999.\n\n* There are higher capacity magazines available for original SIG P226, Like 20 rounds. Can they also be used with some alteration in this Pistol ? Or any other method of higher capacity magazines for this.\n\nBecause the primary attraction for me from Mp-446 towards CZ-999 for my first personal handgun (i am using only my dad''s Remington''s 1911,TT and Makarov and now thinking to buy one from my pocket money) is the extra magazines.

One popular belief is that if the crown is not perfectly symmetrical, then one side of the pellet or bullet can exit before the other and allow escaping gas to impart a destabilizing effect on the bullet/pellet at the beginning of its path to the target. So, crowns have to be perfect.\n\nThe idea behind barrel re-crowning is to improve upon most air guns quick/cheap mass-produced production techniques which often results in a poor crown. A poor crown generally results in a gun that shoots off-center as the pellet gets hung-up on the barrel tip as it exits, pulling it to one side or another.  Perfect crowns improve accuracy.\n\n[URL]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OorpZlG28fI[/URL]\n\nI used Turtle Chrome Polish that has polishing agents. Household tootpaste can also be used. Make sure the airgun is not loaded and you use the right brass screws for it. Rounded edged ones (pictures below) not the ordinary admajee wood screws with flat heads. Screw should be just a little bigger than the muzzle. It needs to spin on the muzzle edge not inside the barrel to make a 1 to 1.5mm perfectly polished edge called the crown. Make sure ur drill machine does not have too much wobble or else u will acheive an oval crown instead of a round crown. \n\nView the video above and the pictures to see how it is done. \n\nSharing the best picture of i could get of the perfect CROWN on my Rainbow 35..with screws, and drill used. \n\n[B][I]Good Luck if you attempt to DIY !![/I][/B]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6125[/ATTACH]', 1, 0, '139.190.194.82', 0, 1, 7, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It''s all-metal (I personally prefer metal over polymer even on a bad day) and comes with a slide-mounted safety/decocker.

I said it was "uber-sexy" because it felt "just right" in my hand, even more than the Shark C which I had been considering getting.

But its availability is rather rare and its possession seemed  very remote up to now.  \n\n   One of my friend’s mentioned about an acquaintance of his willing to part with a Ruger .22 cal Mk II. Purchased from USA.  I contacted the person who turned out to be my senior and a thorough gentleman, on top of it we had been stationed together for good many years in the past .It was just coincidence that we had not met were we are now all these years.    \n\n   Subsequent to meeting and renewal of our acquaintances the deal was done. He never wanted to sell the pistol in the market and was truly happy to make me the new owner. I would greatly appreciate if the value of this weapon is not inquired and gauged in monetary terms, as it would spoil the timeless aroma of the comradeship which I share with my colleagues. For this I would be, and am immensely grateful in advance. \n\n   The pistol is a real pleasure to shoot, the accuracy is phenomenal. Only about 15 rounds have been fired through it by the previous owner out of a box of 50 Winchester Super Max Hollow Point .22 LR Ammo. The unfired bullets and a spare Magazine also came with it. The bore is bright and shiny with clear rifling, the crown is perfect. Retains its blueing though it has some slight handling marks.\n\n   I have done the field stripping just to get the feel about assembly and disassembly, which went very smoothly.

The original company was brought out by a British company called Modular Industries and operated under the name :-\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4][B]Bremmer Arms Company[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\nwho were using the Parker-Hale factory to re-manufacture the American Springfield M1903A3 and the M1903NM rifles. In 1992 it seems they did a deal with the Gibbs Rifle Company of America to make the Parker-Hale line of bolt action rifles but this venture was a disaster and it lasted about two years. Meanwhile the Bremmer Arms Company ran into legal troubles over the import of some of their re-manufactured M1903''s into the US and as a result they shut down the company pretty damned quick to get out of the bother they had gotten themselves into.  This last bit is hear-say as so far no proof has come to light but when seeking more information about the Parker-Hale history I located a couple of ex-workers who claim to have witnessed Bremmer Arms bosses burning the records in a skip in the yard of the factory. Now the barrel making plant and tooling from Parker-Hale is still in England as the company[B] Armalon[/B] purchased it and moved it south to their own factory. \n\nWhat happened to&nbsp;the rest of the tooling from Parker-Hale I do not know but large quantities of finished parts and unfinished parts were sold off at auction to the trade some of which may have found overseas buyers. Proper UK made Parker-Hale rifles will bear the correct Birmingham proof marks. Sorry to say the stock must be removed to see them as for some reason P-H always had the applied at the bottom of the barrel with only the calibre marking on top visible. Part of your problem may stem from the fact that there were a fair number of finished rifles that were also sold off and some are still surfacing NIB still and in some not catalogued calibres. \n\nNow I cannot help about local Pakistan made copies but with the aid of the Birmingham proof marks it is often possible to date the Parker-Hale rifles. To further confuse matters Parker-Hale also did different types of finishes to their rifles depending on it''s intended market. I have seen P-H 1200''s with a matt blue finish instead of the usual high gloss blacking that Parker-Hale we noted for. The bolts could be blacked, left polished in the white of have just the rear of the bolt and handle blacked. I have not heard of nor seen any mention of Parker-Hale using chrome lined barrels.

Gauge = 12 Gauge\r\n2. System = Gas Autoloader\r\n3. Barrel Length = nicely blued 28 inches with chrome plated bores\r\n4. Chokes Supplied = 5 (Screw in)\r\n5. Weight = 6-7 pounds (felt really light weight)\r\n6. Furniture = Turkish Walnut with good grain\r\n7. Rib width = 6-7mm wide rib.\r\n8. Price = Drum Roll Please! [B]PKR 100K[/B]\r\n \r\nAs they say "looks can be deceiving......" before we continue be warned that this review is not for the faint hearted or for anybody looking for some blind Webley & Scott praise.\r\n\r\n[B]Initial Impressions:[/B]\r\n\r\nA beautifully finished, High-end shotgun like appearance and a light weight shotgun. I specially liked the shape lines of the shotgun, really high tech looking.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011225.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe Laser checkering is fine and crisp. The good looking pattern too. it offered good and comfortable grip.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011215.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe forend is nice and slim. offers superb grip and handling. Fine Laser checkering here as well. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011213.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe Wood grain is also pretty good to look at. felt pretty much similar to a Hatsan Escort Luxano.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011224.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI specially like the shape lines. they give the shotgun space-age type look (to me atleast).\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011214.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe chrome plated bolt assembly was nicely fabricated though I would have preferred a stainless steel bolt. it moved smooth and without any grittiness inside its channels in the receiver.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011219.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe trigger was absolutely horrible. it felt like you are pulling a two ton truck with your finger. it was heavy and the break was not even close to what you call a clean (glass like) break. Its official, now I know what a truly bad trigger feels like.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011218.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nhave you ever seen a more misaligned shotgun rib? the picture clearly the attention to (mechanical) detail Webley & Scott has put into this shotgun. the receiver to rib alignment is off by no less than 2mm. everybody at the range was complaining that the gun isn''t hitting straight. Initially we all thought that it must be a fitting (shooter) issue.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011217.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nNow this is what I call a true representation of the W&S quality. the front bead isn''t even properly centered on the rib. mistakes like these even give lemons a bad name. The gun is supplied with 5 screw in choke tubes similar to [B]any Turkish[/B] shotgun. lols!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011216.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe wooden forend rattled like crazy even after firmly tightening the forend screw. may be its meant to do that. lols!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011223.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe internals were nicely machined. the mag tube was hard chrome plated. the gas pistol was assembly looked as if its black chrome plated.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011222.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nHere is another look. I did like the action bars (stainless steel). looks like a pretty solid setup. but the gas assembly is nothing out of the ordinary (or high tech).\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011221.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe gas piston assembly seemed pretty straight forward. nothing out of the ordinary or high tech here. in other words, its not something you would write home about.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011220.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnother look. its not the kind of a system employed in most Turkish shotguns. to me, Hatsan''s gas system looks and feels far more impressive.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Webley%20and%20Scott%20X12/02122011221.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe gas piston itself is unusually large. however the gas cylinder is similarly sized to most Turkish autoloader shotguns.\r\n\r\n[B]Final Impressions:[/B]\r\n\r\nThe [B]Jamo-matic[/B] shotgun failed to cycle (bolt did not move backwards at all) each and every load (80% or above failure rate) that was put in it. The ones that did manage to throw the bolt back all ended up in FTEs (Failure to Eject). two may be three times the bolt was stuck in its rear most position so severely that a bit of engineering was done to get it back into fire-able state. The gun''s shooting was so off the mark that everybody thought that its a fitting issue. [B]W&S X-12 proved to be nothing more than an absolute disappointment[/B].\r\n\r\nIt could be a lemon but quiet frankly, I have seen better lemons from some really low end shotgun manufacturers with some of the highest lemon producing tendencies.\r\n\r\n[B]In Short:[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]STAY AWAY IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY[/B]. There are better ways out there to waste your money. you will be better served with other Turkish shotguns which are available at half the price compared to W&S.\r\n\r\nIf you want a quality shotgun that provides what ever it advertises then get your self a Hatsan Escort (NO! I do not work for the company and no association of any kind as well) or any other tried and tested Turkish shotgun brand. compared to this, a [B]Hatsan Escort Luxano is twice the gun at half the price[/B].

After mounting the electric motor, and the rest of the essential electronics, next step was flying ,this time there was no on board camera, still pics were taken by his friend Hamza with his Digital SLR and Zoom lenses and he did a good job of it.

But its availability is rather rare and its possession seemed  very remote up to now.  \r\n\r\n   One of my friend’s mentioned about an acquaintance of his willing to part with a Ruger .22 cal Mk II. Purchased from USA.  I contacted the person who turned out to be my senior and a thorough gentleman, on top of it we had been stationed together for good many years in the past .It was just coincidence that we had not met were we are now all these years.    \r\n\r\n   Subsequent to meeting and renewal of our acquaintances the deal was done. He never wanted to sell the pistol in the market and was truly happy to make me the new owner. I would greatly appreciate if the value of this weapon is not inquired and gauged in monetary terms, as it would spoil the timeless aroma of the comradeship which I share with my colleagues. For this I would be, and am immensely grateful in advance. \r\n\r\n   The pistol is a real pleasure to shoot, the accuracy is phenomenal. Only about 15 rounds have been fired through it by the previous owner out of a box of 50 Winchester Super Max Hollow Point .22 LR Ammo. The unfired bullets and a spare Magazine also came with it. The bore is bright and shiny with clear rifling, the crown is perfect. Retains its blueing though it has some slight handling marks.\r\n\r\n   I have done the field stripping just to get the feel about assembly and disassembly, which went very smoothly.

(please note that most weapons have copied this design, so just compare pictures with cz75b or it compact or decocker versions, including p07 duty).\r\n\r\nTheir design incorporates a cross pin to retain the firing pin in its position. This cross pin gets badly damaged by dry firing, as it is hollow in design. I was lucky I had (and have) in spare, so changed just in time. The cross pin runs across the slide, left to right, in the rear serration area (from where we hold and rack the slide), visible as a small hole in below picture. \r\n\r\nAn easy method to avoid damage while dry firing is to make a thick ball of tissue paper, place it at the base of hammer, between hammer and slide area. The cushioning should be think enough to avoid the hammer striking or contacting the firing pin. This can be ensured by using a pencil. Place the pencil in the barrel, flat side facing the firing pin. If the hammer ''strike'' makes the pencil move or fly out, the cushioning is not enough, and a thicker ball of tissue paper will be required. I have made this SOP for all my dry-firing sessions involving handguns, be it with firing pin block or without. For those wondering what is different in weapons without firing pin block, the are retained by a block at the end of the slide, instead of a cross pin, so there is no cross pin to get damaged, and snap caps alone should be enough.\r\n\r\nThe parts that do get stressed are:\r\n1. The firing pin, as it is constantly struck by the hammer during dry firing session\r\n2. Firing pin spring, which absorbs the forward motion of firing pin, and brings the firing pin back in position\r\n3. Hammer surface contacting the firing pin, usually a small dent is created, which is normal so far as no light strikes on live primers are observed\r\n4. Hammer or main spring\r\n5.

Soldiers are always advised to wear thick Cotton/Wool socks to minimize boot biting during long walks and fungal infection as a result of the bite. they are also advised to change their socks as often they can.\r\n\r\n2. Feet expand considerably when subjected to long walks.\r\n\r\n3. with slightly roomier boots, you can put in extra insoles such as Dr. Scholl''s, Sorbothane, spanco or Viscolas. these insoles make walking in hard boots similar to super soft joggers.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.95.206', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Bought a Kickeez recoil pad online. kickeez pads are alot heavier compared to limbsaver. heavy is good. reduces felt recoil exceptionally well.\r\n\r\n2. Bought a sheet of shoulder eez from the same website. its only a sheet of sorbothane. this sheet was then placed on the inside of this shooting vest where the recoil pad makes contact with the shoulder.\r\n\r\n3. length of pull of measure carefully and buttstock was lengthened by 2/8 inches by adding a self made spacer. I know its not much to make any real difference but a proper length of pull reduces the felt recoil considerably but at the cost of slowing the shotgun mount a little.\r\n\r\n4. increased the pitch a little after carefully viewing the pad where it made contact with the shoulder. this ensured maximum contact surface area. this also reduces felt recoil.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nhe shoots all day long now without any discomfort (associated with recoil) and the only complain that I get to hear is that the shotgun is a bit heavy. :)\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.57.207', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This is only possible with Beretta Urika2 above, while Maxus has 28 grams load and up range and Win SX3 has 31-32 grams and up. This is a critical difference in my opinion.

This quite frequently is listed as "looking at the target." A shooter may be focusing his eye on neither the sights nor the target, but since he does not see the target in clear focus he assumes he is looking at the sights. You must concentrate on sight alignment.\n[*]Holding Too Long. Any adverse conditions that interrupt a shooter''s ability to "hold" will cause him to delay his squeeze, waiting for conditions to better. The disturbing factor about this is that you will do it unconsciously; therefore, you must continuously ask yourself, am I being too particular?\n[*]Improper Grip or Position. Suffice to say that you cannot fire a decent score with any gun at any range if you continually change your grip or position.\n[*]Jerk or Heel. The application of pressure either with the trigger finger alone or in case of the heel, pushing with the heel of the hand at the same time. Apply pressure to the trigger straight to the rear and wait for the shot to break.\n[*]Anticipation. Anticipation can cause muscular reflexes of an instant nature that so closely coincide with recoil that extreme difficulty is experienced in making an accurate call. Anticipation is also the sire to flinching.\n[*]Loss of Concentration. If the shooter fails in his determination to apply positive pressure on the trigger while concentrating on the front sight his prior determination needs renewal and he should rest and start over.\n[*]Anxiety. You work and work on a shot, meanwhile building up in your mind doubt about the shot being good. Finally you shoot just to get rid of that particular round so you may work on the others.\n[*]Vacillation (Plain Laziness). This is a mental fault more than a physical one, which results in your accepting minor imperfections in your performance which you could correct if you worked a little harder. The end result being you hope you get a good shot. Just like you hope you will get a gratis tax refund, and you will get one just about as frequently as you get the other.\n[*]Lack of Follow Through. Follow through is the subconscious attempt to keep everything just as it was at the time the shot broke. In other words you are continuing to fire the shot even after it is gone. Follow through is not to be confused with recovery. Merely recovering and holding on the target after the shot is no indication that you are following through.\n[*]Lack of Rhythm. Hesitancy on the first shot or any subsequent shot in timed or rapid fire. Develop a good rhythm and then have the fortitude to employ it every case. Frequently many shooters will have fine rhythm until the last shot of a string and then hesitate, doctoring up that last shot.\n[*]Match Pressure. If there are 200 competitors in a match, rest assured that there are 200 shooters suffering from match pressure. So what makes you think you are so different? If you are exerting all your mental energy toward executing the correct fundamentals rather than the arithmetic evaluation, your shooting match pressure will be what you feel when people congratulate you on a fine performance.\n[/LIST]', 1, 1, '182.177.160.214', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Barrels of an O/U or SxS converge at a known distance thus the point of impact of a slug becomes a guestimation at best. making it extremely difficult to fire slugs with any reasonable accuracy.\n\n2. the front sight is of a bead type. a setup intended for rapid aiming. as it promotes speed but at the cost of accuracy. specially the rifle like accuracy required for firing a single projectile such as a shotgun slug.\n\n3. the two barrels in an O/U or a SxS are held together by a side rib joined together by a solder (mostly cold). the recoil and vibrations caused by a slug can easily work the rib loose.\n\nwith the reasons above, an O/U can handle slugs but it is not recommended.[/QUOTE]\n\nLogically explained.

This has been based on Norma components since about 1951.

It is quite accurate and well-suited for long-range varmint shooting on one hand, and delivers sufficient velocity and energy to take on almost any North American big game on the other hand. A superb deer, antelope, sheep, goat or black bear cartridge, it has also been used successfully on elk, moose, brown bear, lion, buffalo and zebra. Many authorities insist that it is much too light for heavy or dangerous game, but high-velocity advocates insist with equal favour that with proper bullets, it is adequate for any thing except the largest and most dangerous game in close cover. In any event, it is not intended as a woods rifle, for the light, high-velocity bullets are too easily deflected. It is in its element for long-range plains or mountain hunting. For long-range varmint shooting it can only be described as ''spectacular".', 1, 0, '113.203.153.196', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

To shotgun aficionados, however, only the best matter—and “best” takes on a particular meaning in the world of shotguns.\n  A “best gun” is a double-barreled shotgun made with all the care and precision of a work of art. The cream of the crop is the London best—a shotgun made by premier gun makers of London such as Boss & Co., Holland & Holland or J. Purdey & Sons.\n  In 2008, Christie’s held their Exceptional and Fine Sporting Guns and Rifles sale in London. The highlight of the event was a pair of gold-inlaid 12-bore shotguns by J. Purdey & Sons. Gunsmith Ken Hunt was inspired by the Royal Armouries in the Tower  of London. These shotguns are particularly notable for the profusion of gold used in their making and are displayed in an exquisite oak and leather case.\nValued at $320,000 to $400,000, it’s safe to say these fantastic firearms are the most expensive shotguns in the world. \n  [ATTACH=CONFIG]6351[/ATTACH]', 1, 1, '182.177.179.85', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Originally designed for 7.65x22mm Parabellum cartridges, US Army trials in 1906 demanded a semi-automatic pistol with a larger caliber. DWM&#8217;s submission, a Luger adapted to .45 ACP rounds, has since become the most expensive handgun in the world.\nThe .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge, one of the most successful cartridges ever, was designed only a year earlier by American firearms designer John Browning. It has been used in a wide variety of firearms since, owing part of its success to the fact that it isn&#8217;t prone to over penetration and is, therefore, less likely to injure anyone standing behind the original target. Additionally, due to its inherent subsonic nature when firedfrom handguns or short-barreled submachine guns, it is one of the most powerful pistol calibers able to be suppressed.\nOf the two .45 ACP Lugers submitted to the US Army, only one, marked serial number 2, is known to have survived. Serial number 1 is assumed to have been discarded, possibly damaged after the initial trial. For unknown reasons, DWM withdrew from the trials after the first round of tests. At least three more of the .45 ACP Lugers were made, one a carbine bearing serial number 21.\nMost recently, the world&#8217;s most expensive handguns have been valued in excess of $1 million.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6356[/ATTACH]', 1, 1, '182.177.179.85', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

That is one of the reason why I absolutely love a "Neutral" shotgun.\r\n\r\nhowever if I have to pick between a nose heavy and a tail heavy shotgun, I would always prefer a nose heavy shotgun. aids in a smooth swing and you can always use some shot lead mixed with ordinary carpenter''s putty (inside the hollow buttstock) to bring the center of gravity in the smack middle of the shotgun. I prefer right under the forend hinge assembly.\r\n\r\nas far as the poor pattern performance of A400 with Shaheen Cartridges is concerned, I am guessing that it could be the inadequate gas seal inside the over bored barrel of A400. just a guess, I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nusually, as the barrel ID increases beyond a certain degree/point, the wads are unable to provide adequate gas seal which can result in uneven (blown out) patterns.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.38.120', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In waterfowl hunting, the need would be much more, rather essential. Therefore, I would advice A400 lovers to choose 28" barrel NON KICKOFF version: two reasons .... (1) ability to change length of pull and (2) Slight FWB due to removal of KO and addition of 2" barrel length (when compared to 26" brl). Besides 28" is a multiusage barrel - skeet/trap/ducks/upland. The KO system at stock''s rear with hydraulic springs & all, adds considerable weight on rear side even with a 28" barrel.\r\n\r\nOn a different tangent, one thing abt "A400 Xplor Light" ..... users of this weapon which though is very light (around 6.5 lbs ave) probably do not know that there is one major thing that they are forgoing i.e. KO3 system which protects the gun from wear and tear and excesive peening and battering of the receiver and mechanism.

I once mentioned this issue to Chief Sb himself, when he had purchased a custom made TT and Chief replied me after use that I was absolutely right on this point, since his extractor was having the same issue.\n\nYou cannot carry a gun which is [I]ammo specific[/I]. At times 311 ammo is available, at times you have to look around for it.\n\nYou basically have 2 options:\n\n[B]1) Change the extractor.[/B]\n\n[B]2) Return the gun, even if at 2-3K''s loss.[/B]\n\nI did the latter, coz I didn''t want a desi extractor in a Chinese gun, even though it was a "DOSSAL" product. Price of this gun should not exceed 16-18K''s.\n\nSince I did not have anyone to guide me, I ended up spending some 5K''s in just experimenting with different ammo. It doesn''t support other Chinese ammo, like the 2008 head-stamped.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nAk bro \n\nthe rounds got stuck in pistol was desi rounds i wasnt aware before not to use desi rounds in forieng made \nat that time problem faced was hammer was backward and triger was free not firring \n\ni fired 10 rounds at that time \nnext day i visited to complaint but they told me not to use desi amo it will affect pistol performance and recomended to use foreign made ammo and then tested some 311 at dealer place then i took 25 pieces but was still not satisfied untill i try some by my hand so i tried 5rounds to fire and worked fine,no hammer trigger issue absolutely fine \ni still have to check for my satisfaction kindly tell me names of other foreign ammo of 30 bore so i cld try them too tell me the variety of ammo available in PK', 1, 0, '202.69.8.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

[/B]\nAccording to reports, five poachers, among them Ramzan Shoro and Pervez allegedly paid Rs5,000 bribe to game watcher of the area, Suleman Khoso, to look the other way when they hunted down the antelope about three weeks ago in Naryasar village, a game sanctuary near Nagarparkar.\nThe news about the rare animal`s hunt came out when Pervez posted snaps of about 200 animals and birds, including the antelope recently hunted near Naryasar village on his profile on the Facebook, and thereby left no recourse to the wildlife officials but to take some sort of action. Dawn\nDistrict Game Warden Shoukat Ali Hingorjo on Friday imposed a fine of Rs50,000 on the five poachers. He told that during an inquiry into the poaching incident and a visit to the site, a local influential man Hamir Shoro, admitted to involvement of his son Ramzan and others in hunting the endangered animal in violation of game laws.\nAn FIR was registered against Ramzan Shoro, Samero Kolhi, Jafar Shoro, Pervez, Ratno Kolhi and two unidentified men and Rs50,000 fine was imposed on them, he said.\nHe said that another antelope was also reportedly hunted near Dhingano village, Nagarparkar taluka, about three weeks ago and the matter was being investigated.\nGame Watcher Suleman Khoso and his colleagues posted in Nagarparkar taluka had been accepting bribes to allow hunters and poachers to hunt down the rare animal, he said.\nHe said that Suleman had been transferred to the wildlife department`s head office in Karachi in the past over public complaints but he succeeded in getting himself reposted to Nagarparkar by using his connections, he alleged.\nHe said that an inquiry was being conducted against the game watcher.\nPoaching and hunting of rare and endangered species of antelope, deer, houbara, peacock, partridge, sand goose and hare in Karoonjhar hills game sanctuary continues unabated under the very nose of wildlife officials but they usually turn a blind eye to it for obvious reasons.\n[url]http://www.dawn.com/2011/11/27/hunter-invites-action-by-posting-pictures-of-animals-on-internet.html[/url]', 1, 1, '182.177.211.1', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Putting a twenty  bore cartridge into a twelve bore and then placing another twelve bore  cartridge over the top of it is one of the most common shooting  accidents, and several people are lucky to only lose fingers every year;  for the less fortunate, the results can be fatal\n[*]When actually shooting driven birds, never swing the barrels through  the line of guns; always be aware of everybody else&#8217;s position. A shot  in a direction that could potentially endanger anybody else must never  be taken. A good rule is to make sure there is "sky" behind the bird  before firing\n[*]Most of these safety procedures are common sense but they must  always be strictly adhered to.

I don''t believe you have fired that many through it otherwise you would revise your statement.  Subsonic WILL clog up your firing Pin.  Read the article on the reliable feeding for P22, the way I did it, it fires EVERY Ammo EVERY time.\nSecondly, I agree with most when they say, that the p22 is not for HD.  In others case(s), agreed.  I, however, do carry and have been carrying either the Beretta 87 or the P22 for SD.  Reason, I now have experienced MY guns enough to realize whether or not they will fail and with which ammo.  \nSecondly, my position is this: if the FBI makes its agents qualify four times (shooting) a year to allow field work - and its been shown statistically that in a fire fight even they end up missing 40+% of the times... where does that leave us?  Hands shaking, nervous, sweating palms... etc etc I want a gun I can just hold without it slipping and pull the trigger repeatedly without jerky recoil and NOT taking my aim out of sight after the first round.  All I gotta worry about is the slightly nervous shaky hands, I have taken out most of the other variables for my gun.

Cosmetics is something else - unless you are going into collecting guns. For practical use, a scratch on the wood stock should not be of concern.

Fee (If Any), get out of city Lic also work but, WHY if you can have it at your door-step, I agree that KHI dealers do charge a bit-high, BUT do make them aware that if we move to HYD or any other city for our required task "THEN" what are they left with to do business ?\n\nLike in another thread I calculate a nominal cost as;\n\nGovt Fee (if Any) + Service Fee (Agent''s Service Fee to perform job + Dealers Charges to make things done at the their responsibility.)\n\nSo if the Govt. Fee is Rs 2,000 + then Service can be some where around 75% to 100% (Or in some cases up to 150%) but never above that,\n\nBrothers try to get your dealers to a nominal cost based upon the nature of work and Govt fee involved, incase of No Govt fee; then a cost somewhere 2,000 to 3,000 (like Section 144 Exception Permission)............\n\nDo try it, Hope this will work, as if we all try to set cost like this, there will sure be a "Calculated Way" in getting a true costing.\n\nRegards', 1, 1, '182.178.85.225', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If you can afford it , get the best and most reliable weapon you can afford.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSalam Trajan Bro,\r\nOk, consider this, you have a shotgun shouldered in a situation. You press the trigger, but the round fails to ignite..... now in a semi auto, you have to take your one of your hands(in most cases your trigger hand) and pull back to load a new round, but with the pump action, your front hand is already ON the action of the bolt, all you have to do is pull back, push back and we''re ready.\r\nCase 2, you fire a round but round fails to eject, with the shell caught in your action, you again have to take one of your hands off the normal position and use force to clear the shell. With a pump action, you can exert more force just because of the posture you''re in.\r\nCase 3, you shoot, the case eject but the gun fails to feed the round. Once again the outcome should be predictable :)\r\n\r\nThe second thing that you pointed out of pump action guns jamming, but like you said they were local guns, the materials and engineering principles of production in these are mostly flawed(even more specifically, the ones that jam). That''s why a GOOD pump action is recommended. I personally have used the DSA Shooter, a Remington 870 and a Winchester 1300. No issues whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAll this said, I am not saying that semi autos will ALWAYS jam, just that the probability of one jamming is higher(due to all the moving parts involved) than that of a pump action. Even a pump action can malfunction, just the probability is lower.

You press the trigger, but the round fails to ignite..... now in a semi auto, you have to take your one of your hands(in most cases your trigger hand) and pull back to load a new round, but with the pump action, your front hand is already ON the action of the bolt, all you have to do is pull back, push back and we''re ready.\nCase 2, you fire a round but round fails to eject, with the shell caught in your action, you again have to take one of your hands off the normal position and use force to clear the shell. With a pump action, you can exert more force just because of the posture you''re in.\nCase 3, you shoot, the case eject but the gun fails to feed the round. Once again the outcome should be predictable :)\n\nThe second thing that you pointed out of pump action guns jamming, but like you said they were local guns, the materials and engineering principles of production in these are mostly flawed(even more specifically, the ones that jam).

Some feel comfortable to use pump and others semi autos. But for higher risk involve in fighting with robbers or bad guys pump is best due to minimum time of thinking and fighting. \nUse pump.\n\nChuk chuck dhoooz, chuck chuck dhooz.

Chinese airguns, as I know, are not durable and the claimed fps is highly exaggerated. The springs wear off after a few hundred shots. Even if I was going to get a Chinese airgun, I''d get a Stoegar or Ruger. However as I have not experienced the gun you are talking about, I can''t comment, personally I''d never par 35k or 28k on a Chinese airgun, that too which I have never heard of. The choice is yours.\r\n The appearance of the regular 350magnum can be seen in my other thread:- Raised cheek-piece, Rubber recoil pad, checkering, and cheap iron sights.\r\n What I love about the classic variant is the long-sleek finely-grained stock, which makes the gun more balanced than the other one mentioned, though weight difference is just 200 grams or so (classic is just 200 grams lighter). Secondly it has no recoil pad. Thirdly, I like the fiber optic sights. Recoil difference is just due to fine tuning of this gun, I think it has a 20% milder recoil than the other one I had. The raised cheek piece on the other 350mag made shooting pleasure less. The stock used to hit my jaws. Probably this was due to the barrel slightly tilting upwards, should be fine. Overall, I like the classic 350 much more and it''s prettier.\r\n To utilize the power, a scope is a must.', 1, 1, '119.73.12.37', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Soon,they came back in claiming to have killed a bird which fell far-away in the Nallah. I snitched the rifle from them and ran outside with a pellet loaded. On a fruit tree and at a range of about 6 meters I saw a bird,took my first shot in a hurry as my brother was running after me, and much to his dislike, down went the bird after flying till my neighbor''s house. I received compliments from my Grandfather( my hunting teacher), and he promised me a reward, now I have forgotten what it was. Hunting always caught my attention and I used to love game meat (still do) which my elders used to give me. \nThen I progressed to a newer Chinese airgun, on to a .177 Diana 21, and finally a RWS 350 magnum.. In between I started shotgun hunting with my grandpa and uncle. Old hunting memories still fascinate me and I have made a small archive of as much as I could capture on camera.\nMy first dove came after much desperation, utter hardship and a lot of time. One day one just came and sat on the "Dharaik" 10 yards away from me. I had my airgun in my hands (as usual on weekends), shot, down it came. I kept it in the freezer a few days just to have a glare of it. Finally went into my stomach. After that, MashAllah have shot hundreds of them and taken part in many hunts.[/QUOTE]\n\nNice Share Brother.', 1, 1, '202.142.172.190', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Well, my purpose was to know of your experience, not to challenge your ratings, as such. So, very kind of you to explain your methods and experiments. We need more of such, preferably with photographic support, whenever in the field, as that say''s lot more than the verbal resume.\n\nWe''ve experimented with a few, inclusive of Magtech Brazil, Armscor, Prvi Partizan, and I shall post a link to the thread by the bottom of this post, as per your kind request.\n\nAs regards my own wording quoted by your good self above, well, let me say, those words -[I] if understood correctly from my post in separate thread[/I] - were meant for the Prvi Partizan one, about which I stated that it [I]was compromising on the expansion[/I], in favour of reliability, as well as [I]adaptability[/I] to specific feeding ramps of some handguns. The Armscor ones expand much better, if only your gun accepts these. I just did not like the cosmetic appearance of these, wrt the non-uniform tip cavity from round to round.\n\nWe''ve not tested the S&B round so far, yet I assume it should expand reasonably well. I intend to do a review of this one at earliest convenience, since it''s an expensive round, the mushrooming capability of which should be determined for the good of our community. It stands at Rs. 120 per round as of now, hence the double of all other rounds. I truly hope it delivers commensurately well.\n\nAs regards your notions on the Barnaul, well, I''d like to see the substantiated proofs of it being good or better than the rest, coz I''ve my doubts on it''s mushrooming capability at the heavy grainage of 145. A Jhp round requires a high muzzle velocity for best expansion, which I doubt the 145 grained would have.\n\nWe''ve found the Armscor one as the best with respect to expansion vs the Prvi Partizan. And I don''t quite think water gallons would give the desired mushrooming effect at impact. You''d need somewhat more solid an object to impact it on.\n\nThe Prvi and S&B, however, due to the sharper nosed profile would suit the more troublesome of handguns, with respect to positive feeding/extraction. \n\nI am of the view that in selecting a Jhp ammo, it''s expansion capability should be the foremost thing for consideration, and one must then experiment with a few that your handgun works best with, wrt to feeding reliability, lest you''re carrying one that does feed reliably, but yields no more results than an fmj!\n\nBelow our own review, conducted last year:\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?5205-9mm-vs-.45ACP-Which-caliber-do-you-prefer-and-Why&p=171741&viewfull=1#post171741[/URL]\n\nSome links on the Prvi Partizan, Sjhp''s:\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?6416-prvi-partizan-not-expanding-at-all-s[/URL]\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '119.153.60.202', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
