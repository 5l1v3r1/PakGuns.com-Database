(444624, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;67113]Salams, a lot of the friends that come here to PakGuns are relatively new to the world of firearms and are thinking about or have recently got a new license and are looking for the right right gun to buy for their SD or HD (Self Defense, Home Defense) needs. Many new threads are opened everyday about the topic and it gets repetitive and the information becomes less useful over time. \n\nI would like to suggest a couple of guns for the first time users in various price ranges and a mini one line review of the suggested firearm. Details and discussion on any of them can be found by clicking the search button on our panel bar and typing the desired gun name i.e Glock or CF98.\n\nTo start off with I would like to say that the most important thing when keeping a gun for self defense is knowing how to use it properly. All guns are useless and counter productive if the shooter does not have a reasonable level of proficiency in the use of the firearm. Proficiency only happens by firing atleast 200 to 300 rounds in a controlled environment like a range and at a target. Once you are hitting a head size target at 10 to 25 feet you are good to go since in 90 % of the cases that is the maximum distance your gun will be used for defensive shooting.\n\nMost people new to firearms do not understand what calibers are and what difference it makes. In a nutshell calibers are difference sizes of bullets, .22 being small, 9mm being average and .45 being large.  The difference it makes to [B][U]New Users[/U][/B] is that generally the larger the bullet, the higher the recoil and lower the accuracy of the second shot. I suggest selecting 9mm as a caliber for your defense needs. It''s like Goldilocks porridge not too hot, not too cold and just right ;) \n\nIn the world of firearms and defense the most important thing is reliability and all the weapons listed here have proven their worth by multiple tests. Ofcourse the more you spend the more reliable firearm you will get. \n\n\nIn 9mm there are several guns available in the market in varying price ranges. A suggested few are:\n\nIn the Rs. 30,000 price range there is the [B]CF-98[/B].\n\n[IMG]http://www.leverarms.com/Pistol%20Images/Norinco%20CF98.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIt is made in China and is a decent medium size light weight gun. It is quite accurate and probably the best you can buy around Rs. 30,000.\n\nIn the Rs. 45,000 price range, your options open up quite a bit and there is the [B]CZ 999, the Canik 55 and the Stoeger Cougar 8000.   [/B]\n\n[B]CZ 999:[/B]The CZ is a great gun, extremely accurate and well made. You cannot go wrong with it. It is a high quality copy of the SIG 226 pistol which retails for around Rs. 350,000. It is made in Serbia. \n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/cz999-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Canik 55:[/B] This is my personal favorite. It''s a clone of the CZ75 B and is the most accurate sub Rs. 100,000 pistol I have ever fired. Very high quality copy. Made in Turkey. I got mine for just under Rs. 40,000.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik552.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Stoeger Cougar:[/B] Probably one of the most discussed pistols at PakGuns, this pistol is very highly regarded by all for it reliability and size. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik555.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Taurus PT 99[/B]. If you are a fan of Beretta and large shiny objects appeal to you ;) I suggest looking no further than the PT 99 by Taurus. It is one of the best pistols of the world in any price range. Very high quality piece and one of my favorites. I have shot over 4000 rounds though my pistol and it''s still brand new. Very accurate too. The only drawback is the size, it is a large frame pistol and not really comfortable to carry around. Very highly recommended. Price Around 54 K.\n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/taurus_pt99.jpg[/IMG]\n\nApart from these guns, nothing in my opinion can be justified because of the insane prices. The only gun that I would recommend spending more money on is either the Glock 17 or the Glock 19. The 17 sells for around Rs. 225,000 currently and the 19 for Rs. 250,000. The difference between the two is that the 17 is larger and more accurate and the 19 is smaller and slightly less accurate than the 17. The reason you pay a much higher cost is reliability and durability. Glock is absolutely the most reliable handgun in the world and it will last multiple lifetimes.\n\n[IMG]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/glock17.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nA closing note on magazine capacity ammunition type and durability.\n\nBoys will be boys and every manufacture that makes products aimed at men will stress "more is better" but that is not necessarily always the case. Although a 20 round magazine will get "wow''s" from your friends, more rounds in your magazine will make your weapon larger and heavier. For most situations you do not practically need anything above 13 or 15. Infact that is excessive as well, what you can''t do in the first 5 shots you aren''t going to do in the next 20. So if the handgun you are choosing has a magazine capacity of 13 or 15 you are good to go. If you feel you need more rounds, then that''s what the extra magazine is for. \n\nAmmunition type. For target shooting and practice you use normal 9mm rounds which cost around Rs. 35 (POF, CHINESE). For Self defense however you use "Hollow Points". These bullets are specifically designed for defensive purposes and will expand upon impact thus having a higher probability of knocking your target down. They cost around Rs. 65 to Rs. 250 depending upon make. I would suggest atleast firing a box of 50 rounds of hollow points though your gun to make sure they work well before loading your magazines with them.\n\nDurability. Most people will go on and on about barrel life and forging technology and yada yada. Yawn.... :rolleyes: \n\nA gun will last "FOREVER" if maintained properly. You must clean your gun within 24 hours of use or it starts to get damaged. Barrel life is nonsense and is of no concern to 99 % of the people. Ammunition is so expensive that if we take the CF 98 whose barrel under the worst conditions still lasts 3000 rounds then that means you fired about Rs. 100,000 worth of ammunition though a Rs. 30,000 gun. Not very probable, if someone has that much money to spend on ammo then I''m sure they will buy a better gun first.\n\nAnd last but not least remember that if you own a firearm you are a grownup and a responsible individual. Anger, Machoism and Irresponsible behavior have no place in the life of an firearm owner. Before you own firearms these three things should be ingrained in your psyche. \n\n\n1). EMPTY OR LOADED, NEVER EVER POINT YOUR GUN AT ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DESTROY.\n\n2). ALWAYS ALWAYS KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER TILL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THE TARGET.\n\n3). NEVER CARRY/USE A GUN UNLESS YOU NEED TO.\n\n\nHope this little write up helps all our new brethren to the wonderful world of Firearms ! If anyone has any question I and all PakGunners will answer them gladly. No question is too basic or foolish, we are all learners here.[/QUOTE]\n\nws,\nvery good information thanks. i was reading some of the threads. everyone seemed to know a lot about guns. this post was a welcome surprise.\n\n\nliked the forum rules btw: be polite, we all have guns...lol.', ''),

(444600, ' [QUOTE=atiq;282195]CZ999 is a VERY VERY sturdy gun and I haven''t seen any gun that could beat it at this.. BUT the only thing against it not favoring you is that it is a full size gun. you are going to wear it in IWB holster. With the weight, size and height it has it is a very hard to conceal gun.\nStoeger is a full size yet a smaller gun relatively to CZ999, Rotary barrel doesn''t matter that much. I don''t like Stoeger ONLY because of the safety on the slide. It HURTS my hands a LOT when I have to rack the slide in fast action secondly the whole side has a cutaway and is slippery, used it at the range twice with sweaty hands and it was mighty difficult to rack it from any other place other than the serrations and on serration half of them are covered by the HUGE safety. it is on a heavier side, extremely sturdy but NOT as sturdy as CZ999. Same weight in a smaller package.\nIF it was me then at the price range of 55k NOTHING beats CZ999.\nhere i would ask sadatpk brother to give his input as he LOVES it more than any other gun and he has had pretty good results as it fits him perfectly.\n\nCZ from Czechoslovakia is a different matter altogether.. they are what defines what a GUN is; without going into the history, i assure you that if you go for the CZ75 family you will NEVER ever be disappointed from the quality, shooting ease, and the value it offers. IF you can then raise your eyes towards CZ75c (Compact) or cz75b(full size). If you intend to carry buy the CZ75c. IMHO there is no other gun that offers such extreme value for money as CZ family does.\n\nCZ75 Duty is a polymer framed wonderful gun, light to carry extremely reliable, accurate and excellent gun. for CC(conceal carry) it is also one of the top choices but will not beat cz75c.\n\nSo the list for you should be\n\n1)Cz75C\n2)Cz 75 Duty\n3)CZ999\n4)Stoeger.\n\nAlso keep in consideration..\nNP34 ... a chinese clone of SIG P228\nCanik 55 L120 (Clone of Cz75b) Alloy frame\nCanik 55 C100 (Clone of Cz75c) Alloy frame\n\nCanik is a NATO certified gun.. their certifications follow the strictest rules of EPVAT, in Turkish guns i would only recommend you to look into "Canik 55" family only rest are not as good as Canik though price is same.\n\nI own NP22 and have shot about 1200 rounds in a day. YES 1200 rounds in a day.. and the round count has neared 7000 and broke the locking lug spring.. The gun comes with a spare set of springs..[/QUOTE]\nRespected Atiq sb,Cz999 is a wonder ful gun with superb result in its price range,After 5000 fires my piece is still like new,there is no voilence mark inside, field striping is very easy,slide is fit to frame in an excellent way, there is no rattling till now,It is damn accurate gun Far ahead than any turkish gunIMHO,as it owns the tradition of Zastava Arms and euro metallergy.\nSir Atiq sb, no gun can beat this beast in its price range,but this is sad that it is no more in Markeet here in punjab,however Np22,Np34 r also Sig clone of very high quality,and the real value for money,IMHO thisCz999 just enjoys the honorary rank of CZ,however its younger br is in Market with the name of Ez,not Cz as i think Zastava ia also a great name and its product r in service of Serbian Army,which is another proof of Quality control,another worth-mentioning is that in the long span of 5000 fires I have not faced even a single FTE or FTF.', ''),

It is the Titanium version and very light like some of the members pointed out. It also comes with a ported barrel for easier to handle recoil and is very very accurate. The ported barrel is a real help as I also have a Smith and Wesson 2" .357 in steel and the difference in recoil is alot. I do carry this on the ankle many times and the light weight really helps.

(444645, ' Salam All,\r\nTOTALLY AGREE Moeen Bhai. And lolz @ the "anomalies".... :D\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of handguns; combat and competition. When one is aiming at competition(which clearly the op is :)), it always helps to have the best equipment no matter what the sport is. It actually gives the user benefit in the sense that he/she can concentrate on the mistakes being made and correct them. Same holds true to shooting. An interesting thing that ED bro said, that a professional driver can beat us on a normal road even if he is in a Mehran, I think that''s because he has actually driven perfect machines and in doing so perfected his FEEL for driving. For example people like me, who have just shot combat handguns, have reported "Unintentional" discharge of a Tactical Sports (I havent shot one myself) due to a very light trigger, when shooting the first time. And I think if I try to race in a Ferarri for the first time on a normal road, I''m positive I''ll bang it up :D. I think a person who starts shooting a TS regularly will become a better shot quicker, even with combat handguns. So a good competition gun will help you to learn the sport quicker vs a combat handgun. The same holds true for combat handguns alone, a good gun will help you improve shooting much better and quicker than a clone. :)\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(444802, ' I beg to differ Moeen Bhai. A Glock is a Glock is a Glock and that IMHO is the only reason it commands such prices. \n\nBesides what good will it do em to strike us off their export list. The gun manufecterers in the west are not responsible for their goverment''s policies and neither are they getting the HUGE margins being charged for their products here. \n\nTheir products are still being sold at their list prices by them. What happens to the same products afterwords and what whopping margins our dealers charge is not their concern since they are only getting what they charge.\n\nIf for some reason the muslim world slaps an embargo on us (An exteedingly unlikely event) The same guns will simply disapear here. I Mean how many people (Staunch Caracalists that they may be) will prefer a 300k Caracal to a 300k Glock?\n\nIn which case the lose a pretty big market for their guns. A market where thanks to the political embargo they can rule the roost unlike the west where they have to fight tooth and nail to make a name for themselves amongst a veritable plathora of similar handguns\n\nThe only reason that prices fluctuate so wildly is due to the sweet whims of our dealers. Its the only reason why the 24/7 Taurus can be sold at 150k one year and 55k the next by the same freakin dealer. \n\nA case in point. A Moonstar Brand local Vlotro clone at Shahid arms centre  M.A. Jinnah Road was worth 27k. The same gun at the Moonstar factory outlet Lucky star was worth 16k. They do offer after sales service as well.\n\nSo, if there is an honest-to-goodness 3S (Sales, service spare parts) dealership here.

An answer to this can be had by asking Glock.  When a country decides to order say 20000+units verses us (probably 1000) and that country also states to Caracal something like "... and now that you are in the big league we prefer you don''t sell to the.... what do you think Caracal is going to reply by stating NO its a muslim country we will sell to them?!!!"  Bro, if you believe that then I do have a beachfront property in Islamabad as gift for you ... lolz.

And at the end of the day, its all about supply and demand.  Sure, people will pay 300k for it here.  I remember when they were paying 365k for that Taurus 24/7!!!!  Yes, thats right 24/7.

I will state this though for the Caracal, it is a GREAT pistol for the price in Pakistan.  Its new in the market and I am sure there will be many more generations to come before it becomes equal to if not near to the quality of the Glock... but there is much time to go on that.  The Plus side to the Caracal is that this company is backed up with some SERIOUS money; hence, further development of it is I am sure continuous and quick.  I do believe that most of us will never end up in a Rambo like situation and if we did... we would turn and run rather than have a standoff which may require our weapons to go through sand, mud, or water pit firings!\nAnd if nothing else, here is something to think about... 12years ago, you could find a Glock at any gun shop for about 60k/rs, then the imports stopped and the price jumped.  What do you think is gonna happen when this Caracal also stops coming to Pak..  So guys its also a great investment.  Once this thing takes off in the West and it will, we are gonna be off their export list QUICK...  Something to think about.  Then we will be paying about 300k for it like the glock.\nAs far as those who think that the NATO tests were bought... I say this, ALL their tests CAN be swayed in one direction; but bought I don''t think so...  I can just imagine Gaston Glock bribing NATO with his Cutlery Sets when Glock went for its NATO approval...lolz.\nAnd Caracal bribing NATO with OIL... hmmm, I think I stepped in it this time...lolz[/QUOTE]\n\nSir, I agree you on it, genuine words.', ''),

I am not sure if the reporter''s version can be relied upon. \nThe news item seems to say that NADRA is not the competent authority to grant licences and only the MOI is authorised to issue licences. Fine, I say, but my license was approved by the MOI not NADRA. And, my card license mentions only the GOP and MOI not NADRA. In any case, I don''t see how it matters to anyone whether the MOI delegated the physical processing etc. (as distinct from the actual decision of granting or denying a license to a citizen) to its employees M/s XYZ or to its subsidiary NADRA. \nI fail to see how a petition by people who are unhappy with the decision of the MOI to revalidate licences issued by it should result in outright "cancellation" of a legally obtained (fresh not revalidated) license, issued by the MOI in accordance with existing rules. The physical shape or form of the license instrument or the absence of user friendly protocols for change of weapon (or ammo entitlement) is not suffucient cause to summarily turn lawful citizens into criminals.

Strike One pistol, which is also known as  (Swift bird) in its Russia-made version, is intended to compete for the role of a service pistol for various military and law enforcement forces (in Russia and elsewhere). It will be also offered for civilian sales as self-defense and/or sport weapon, where permitted by law. At the moment of this writing (mid-March, 2012), Strike One pistol is still in prototype / pre-production stage, and its final version most probably will differ from the ones shown here in certain respects. One most noticeable feature of the Strike One pistol is its extremely low bore axis, which helps to control recoil and muzzle rise during rapid fire.\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Type \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Semiautomatic, Single Action (pre-cocked) \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Caliber(s) \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]9x19 Luger/Parabellum, 9x21 IMI, .357SIG, .40SW \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Weight unloaded\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]750 g \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Length \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]210 mm\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Barrel length\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]128 mm\n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="width: 29%"][B][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]Magazine capacity \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/B][/TD]\n[TD="width: 71%"][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3][FONT=Helvetica][SIZE=3]17 rounds \n[/SIZE][/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strike1.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strikeone.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000][IMG]http://i1256.photobucket.com/albums/ii491/jahangir-58/strikeoneb.jpg[/IMG][/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/QUOTE]\n\nApart from cosmetic changes guess which gun it resembles? minus the front serations, the texture of the grip and reduce the barrel length to 4 inches and it looks like a Caracal F', ''),

Mine came with a Straight 8 sight which while easy to align were nothing spectacular.\n\nKindly explain this term STRAIGHT and DOT because i am not familiar with these terms.\n\nSecondly what about the quality of this pistol.IS it reliable as compared to other pistols available in the market like stoeger,CF-98 etc.\n\nI am waiting for your reply.\n\nregards [/COLOR]\n\n\n[QUOTE=Abbas;234193]Salams,\n\n\n\nRecently I was given a Caracal F and Caracal C by the guys at Caracal Pakistan and they asked me to test and review them. I told them plain and simple that the review will be unbiased and I would need a 1000 or so rounds to test it with. They obliged and yesterday I tested the Caracal to my satisfaction.\n\nA few words on Caracal before I go on:\n\nThe Caracal is a new combat handgun from the U.A.E. It was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who first worked at Glock and then moved to Steyr to design the Steyr Mannlicher M & S family of pistols. Caracal''s are made to compete directly with the likes of Glock, Steyr and XDM line of pistols. There are three versions, the F, C & SC which respectively compete with the Glock 17, 19 & 26. It is perhaps also pertinent to mention that Caracal owns the German Shotgun and Rifle manufacturer Merkel which produces the Caracal handguns under licence in Germany as well. \n\nOn to the review: \n\nThe Caracal came in a decent quality plastic box, included in it was the gun, two magazines and a users manual. The manual is in English and well written. The F itself is about the same size as the Glock 17 however it has a 4.1 inch barrel compared to the 17''s 4.5 inch barrel. The gun comes with a safe action (DAO) trigger which functions great and breaks smoothly, the trigger pull is about 5 lbs. The gun comes with two different kind of sights, conventional straight 8 ones (in which you align the two dots to form a figure 8 to be on target) and a quick sight which roughly starts from above the barrel chamber area and extends to the muzzle end. Mine came with a Straight 8 sight which while easy to align were nothing spectacular. The sights also seem to be part of the slide itself which is not a positive. On the back of the gun is a loaded chamber indicator which tells you when the gun is loaded.\n \nThe finishing of the slide and the polymer frame is quite good and defiantly in the exclusive Glock/Styer neighborhood. It weighs about 125g more than the Glock 17 at 750g which is quite welcome as the gun feels very solid to hold. Holding the gun for the first time felt amazing, infact I think it is the most point able gun I have ever held. It gives you Steyr like depth of grip with Glock like solid feel without the Glock grip angle (which does not suit everyone). The checkering on the Polymer grip is very comfortable to hold and even after shooting it quite a lot it still felt good. It does have a ambidextrous mag release but the slide release is only on the left hand side (for right handed shooters). There is a picatinny rail on the front for mounting accessories and a Glock like serial number plate on the bottom of the frame but strangely no serial number printed on it. Overall the polymer frame is top notch/high quality. The disassembly lugs situated right above the trigger finger are made of hardened steel and make disassembly surprisingly even easier and quicker than the Glock (I didn''t realize it could get easier). \n\n[/QUOTE]', ''),

(445275, ' @ Moeen: Thank you for sharing your experience. The competition was narrowed down between a TS and a Czechmate, but i am inclining towards the TS now.\nHowever, i did try a colleagues TS who had modified the trigger to less than 1LBS pull AND i can VOUCH that i experienced accidental discharges (double tap) on MORE than a few occasions. I then gave up on my quest for the TS. most of my handguns are and always have been combat /tactical style pistols, but the eye opener was when i took the SP-01 Phantom to the range and shot a respectable 70% on the first go. With a SP_01 Shadow borrowed at the range, i immediately felt the difference in the trigger pull (smoother as it does not have a firing pin block) and proceeded to shoot in the 80 percentile range.\nWhile i had my heart towards a Czechmate, i think the advise is correct, the red dot sight would be  a major drawback and when it comes to the price-value-utility the TS would be better. I think i will give an unmoded TS a go when i get back to Pakistan next month. \n\nAs for the debate below, everyone is right in their own opinions in DIFFERENT circumstances. \nfor example, a complete novice with a a world class weapon could miss entirely, whereas an expert can display a decent performance using a mediocre weapon.  \nHOWEVER< when it comes to two persons of near or equal skills, the better platform would DEFINITELY give a strong edge. A better platform is also critical where accuracy requirements are strict -as they are in a bulls eye competition.  short of being the top 1% accurate shooter in the world, i can wager confidently that a .30 bore local T/T will NEVER consistently score a 90%+ score  on a 25 yard bulls eye target.  A highly quality, accurate weapon would consistently repeat the performance.\n\nThough, in a close range combat scenario, a .30 local bore, in the right hands is just as potent as the most expensive handgun one can buy.', ''),

Mine came with a Straight 8 sight which while easy to align were nothing spectacular.\n\nKindly explain this term STRAIGHT and DOT because i am not familiar with these terms.\n\nSecondly what about the quality of this pistol.IS it reliable as compared to other pistols available in the market like stoeger,CF-98 etc.\n\nI am waiting for your reply.\n\nregards [/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nDesert Storm Bro May i, I think Abbas bhai is out of country. I own a Caracal F with Straight Eight Sights. These sights are also called DOT ON DOT sights because that what you do. Just have to align the dot on the Front sight on top of the dot on the Rear sight and you''re good to shoot. Other sights are called QUICK ACCUSATION SIGHTS or Quick sight hence QS. If your using this gun for Self defense and conceal carry then i would suggest the QS. But if you want to use this gun on Range sometimes, then i''ll recommend you the Straight Eight sight system as its more accurate then the QS. Now coming to the quality thing, this gun has much much better quality then the CF 98 and Stoegar. It''s a very reliable gun too, i''ve fired 300+ round from it with no problems of any kind.', ''),

Googled a bit and found that CF98/NP42 (preferably NP42 cause of better barrel life) is the best among low budget pistols so no confusion about it. Still ideas are welcome :)\n\nNow a piece for under 50-70k budget. Heard and read a lot about CZ75b, but PT99 looks more beauty to me. Gonna try them both soon and will let the hand-grip decide. The only thing bothers me is that I heard a few bad reviews about Taurus, not specifically for PT99 and a Taurus jammed on me once after just 10 rounds, its been years and I am not sure about the exact model.\n\n\nSo enlighten me experts!\n\nAnd yeah it''ll be helpful if anyone can post the current (Karachi) prices for these.\n\n\nThanks!', ''),

(445698, 'Lucky Star series of reviews Part VI This review is in continuation of my series of reviews at Lucky Star (The Karachi version of Neela Gumbad) I had originally gone there to get my shotgun repaired. But could''nt resist having another ''Go'' at the traders there. I was joined by little Tatur1. We visited a total of 11 outlets And if I have forgotten anything I would request Tatur1 to add his memory to mine. \r\n\r\nOur visit was marred by the extremely disturbing news that one of the few dealers that I respect and purchase from was abducted by extortionists. I would request all our brethren here to pray for his early recovery. He has infant children. A number of dealers I talked to are still in a state of shock.\r\n\r\n[b]General  Impression:[/b]\r\n Most of the dealers were in a pretty good mood. And gave us a lot of time. But then this was the 2nd half of a Saturday during Ramadan. Business was slow and they seemed glad to talk.\r\n\r\n[b]1st  port of call[/b].. Haji something or the other This outlet is right next to Ansari arms and the khan sahib deals exclusively in locals. ( I have given his gunsmith my shotgun) The display case was full of shotguns of all shapes and sizes. Some I could recognize as crude versions of the AR 15, M16 and the Seiga 12 and still others that looked like they came straight out of a 5 year old’s nightmare. I asked him if any of them were capable of SD. He did not even bother to look up, simply refused.  \r\nThat’s why I like this guy, once before I had gone to him looking for a 9mm for SD. Even then he had refused. In fact had advised me against getting one if serious SD is my aim. This guy is incidentally either the cousin or the brother of the owner of the Moonstar arms company outlet. \r\n\r\n[b]After that it was Pioneer arms.[/b]\r\n\r\nI think he is a whole seller for his prices were pretty decent. 60K for an Akdal M1919 and 50k for the Hatsan MP A. The TS was not available.  He had the only MP A in the whole market. \r\n\r\n[b]Hussain Brothers:[/b]  M1919 was 63k MPA was not available. A to-thepont-man. No room for ide chit chat so we left\r\n\r\n[b]Ghulam Ali and Sons.[/b] The dealer was quite locasious a best. Wont even let me look at his local offerings. He showed me a lot of guns. Nice ones too! Even when I did not want to see them.. Went a bit further and even showed me videos of him skeet shooting! A little more time and I might have ended up with an invitation to meet his family. However he did show me some really nice stuff. \r\nThe Akkar 222 semi-auto shotgun.. Comes with excellent ghoast ring sights and a highly visible front fibre optic sight. Compared to the Akkar the MP A’s front fibre optics were a complete disapointmnt\r\nThe weapon had a picatinny rail for accessories . 4 chokes and and extra hunting barrel. A rubberized pistol grip and a fairly well made stock completed the ensemble: Asking 60k. \r\nHe said that no Turkish gun should be used with a slug. Not even those with slug barrels. Only Amarican guns are slug capable. To prove it he showed us a mossy maverick pump 5+1 70% or so. 80k. Since I had already seem a similar weapon NIB at Mega. I was not interested.  \r\nThen it was on to handguns. I finaly saw the Salsimarz ST 10. I a dead ringer for the H&K USP. Unfortunately while it looks like fairly accurate clone of the H&P USP. It does not have the functionality of the “Universal Style Pistol”  I.e a safety lever but no decocker.  He also showed me a USP as well. Bout 80% or so. Asking 350k and NIB 400K \r\nHe was offering a plain vanilla Cougher (Black w/o rails) 65k. CF NIB 44k and Kanuni 2 tone in 65k\r\nP.S. Knew all about Gun forums: In his opinion losers hang out at those…\r\n\r\n[b]Haris :[/b]\r\n The man was busy (I think) Girsan 21 & 23 Not available. Zigana F 75k M1919 65k Hatsan MP A Not available. I saw a 24/7 in the display case and ask him if he had it.. He said No. I realized he really did not like being disturbed. I left.\r\n\r\n[b]TNT Arms:[/b]\r\nThe gent was more helpful then the last time I went there. He deals more or less exclusively in local products. Every weapon there had the Legend “Gul” in a little sunflower on his gun. He was selling Seiga 12 and AK-47 Shotgun knock offs at 28k apiece. Asked us to take em home and shoot to our hearts’ content and if satisfied to pay later, He claimed they had been made from Russian Machine guns. Well the barrels  must have been pretty badly chopped up cause I could see multiple welding  joints where the melted metal had been covered in a thin layer of paint. The bolt was rusty as was the folding stock. In fact most of it was covered in rust. He made the usual claim that-his-products-were-the best –in-the-market. And the firing pins and extractors were all made In USA!! What u got was a so-callled American Russian hybrid that would put a vodka soaked Siberian to shame. Honestly speaking I really cant understand why they do this? To us and to themselves as well???\r\n\r\n[b]Ali Muhammad and Sons:[/b]\r\nThis outlet is now a subsidiary of Ammar and co. Adnan handles it as his own outlet. They have a lot of good stuff there and since they are importers at pretty reasonable rates. M1919 at 60k asking Hatsan MP 32k Plain vanilla Cougher 60k and 809 70k as well as G II at the same rate.  I also saw a Taurus  judge .410 revolver 120k. He had gotten it off Guns and accessories.  Taurus .38 special 6 shot 80k .357 and .38 bullets at Rs. 100 and  .410  shot shells at Rs. 120 each (Those things are tiny compared to a 12 guage) Adnan is a friendly chap unlike most of the jaded and cynical dealers around. He was nice enough to let us handle the weapons to our hearts’ content. A practice most dealers frown upon specially with stranger. But this may have been due to the fact that I am old customer of his Uncle’s Khuzema Bandulwala. The original  owners of Ali Muhammad and sons. \r\nUnlike other dealers who refused to make licenses for people below 25 years of age he has no issues as long as the person is 18+. Rate 15k Permits are Rs. 2500. \r\n he had to go somewhere and left us to our own devices while we were extolling the different advantages of the 809 and the cougher his father walked in with a bunch of people in tow demanding to see ‘bareeetas’ “Hamain bareeta dekhao”  His father started yelling at his absent son for leaving the store at his salesman at the boy on the counter… he seems quite fond of it. Yelling I mean.. Before he started on us we decided to slink away. Highly recommended.. Good service reasonable prices. But do check and make sure Papa is not around before you walk in. \r\n\r\n[b]Famous arms:[/b]\r\n\r\nA slightly under the weather Mehmood bhai was sitting  alone in the shop.. He seems quite upset about the abduction of a fellow dealer in the market.. He felt like talking. We  were only too eager to oblige. He had some pretty decent Seiga 12 and ak style shot gun knock offs9(The term ‘decent knock-off” sounds a bit like an oxymoron does’nt it) Asking price 18k and the quality was better.. Much better then the stuff at TNT. He has his own service centre adjacent to the shop. And gives a 3 month replacement warrenty for his weapons and also a lifetime service warranty for all his products including small parts such as pins and extractors. He also offered to test fire the weapon before purchase. A practice that most dealers balk from where shotguns are concerned. \r\n\r\n[b]Bashir Khan and Co.[/b]\r\nA trader rather like TNT offering similar products. T similar prices. Claimed that no 144 has been imposed in Karachi and all licences are closed. He had a TT he called “naga Parbat” partly cause she had heart shaped holes in the slide and was supposedly matt chrome.. Only it turned out to be some sort of light gray colur with little bubbles etched in it. He was selling the Zigana f for around 80k. His products were known by the name of “Chamkani” \r\nLocal bullets rs. 30 and Chinese Rs. 40\r\n\r\n[b]Mega Armoury:[/b] \r\nI dropped in at my old ''friend'' Danish at Mega.. The minute we walked in They gave each other a “oh-no-not-him-again-look ..oooohh we are just closing..Do come back on Monday… M1919  65k (With customers like U we have to have room to maneuvere its not like U are going to give me what I ask) DC License 18k irrespective of age. \r\n\r\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] \r\n\r\nZiganas and Girsans and other Turkish offerings are just bout and in some cases slightly more then Taurus.  70 to 80k range. \r\nMost dealers  are vary of firing slugs in Turkish shotguns.. Specially M1919. The Nickle Plated Akkar pump is not available in fact dealers have not even heard of it.The market is evenly spread b/w dealers who are not willing to make licenses for people below 25 and those who are willing to do so. \r\n\r\nRest I will continue when I pick up my shotgun on Tuesday.', ''),

(445789, ' Enigmatic Desires Bhai Very Very Very Good. Interesting Information about dealers about guns.:clap2::second:\n\n[QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;283954]This review is in continuation of my series of reviews at Lucky Star (The Karachi version of Neela Gumbad) I had originally gone there to get my shotgun repaired. But could''nt resist having another ''Go'' at the traders there. I was joined by little Tatur1. We visited a total of 11 outlets And if I have forgotten anything I would request Tatur1 to add his memory to mine. \n\nOur visit was marred by the extremely disturbing news that one of the few dealers that I respect and purchase from was abducted by extortionists. I would request all our brethren here to pray for his early recovery. He has infant children. A number of dealers I talked to are still in a state of shock.\n\n[B]General  Impression:[/B]\n Most of the dealers were in a pretty good mood. And gave us a lot of time. But then this was the 2nd half of a Saturday during Ramadan. Business was slow and they seemed glad to talk.\n\n[B]1st  port of call[/B].. Haji something or the other This outlet is right next to Ansari arms and the khan sahib deals exclusively in locals. ( I have given his gunsmith my shotgun) The display case was full of shotguns of all shapes and sizes. Some I could recognize as crude versions of the AR 15, M16 and the Seiga 12 and still others that looked like they came straight out of a 5 year old’s nightmare. I asked him if any of them were capable of SD. He did not even bother to look up, simply refused.  \nThat’s why I like this guy, once before I had gone to him looking for a 9mm for SD. Even then he had refused. In fact had advised me against getting one if serious SD is my aim. This guy is incidentally either the cousin or the brother of the owner of the Moonstar arms company outlet. \n\n[B]After that it was Pioneer arms.[/B]\n\nI think he is a whole seller for his prices were pretty decent. 60K for an Akdal M1919 and 50k for the Hatsan MP A. The TS was not available.  He had the only MP A in the whole market. \n\n[B]Hussain Brothers:[/B]  M1919 was 63k MPA was not available. A to-thepont-man. No room for ide chit chat so we left\n\n[B]Ghulam Ali and Sons.[/B] The dealer was quite locasious a best. Wont even let me look at his local offerings. He showed me a lot of guns. Nice ones too! Even when I did not want to see them.. Went a bit further and even showed me videos of him skeet shooting! A little more time and I might have ended up with an invitation to meet his family. However he did show me some really nice stuff. \nThe Akkar 222 semi-auto shotgun.. Comes with excellent ghoast ring sights and a highly visible front fibre optic sight. Compared to the Akkar the MP A’s front fibre optics were a complete disapointmnt\nThe weapon had a picatinny rail for accessories . 4 chokes and and extra hunting barrel. A rubberized pistol grip and a fairly well made stock completed the ensemble: Asking 60k. \nHe said that no Turkish gun should be used with a slug. Not even those with slug barrels. Only Amarican guns are slug capable. To prove it he showed us a mossy maverick pump 5+1 70% or so. 80k. Since I had already seem a similar weapon NIB at Mega. I was not interested.  \nThen it was on to handguns. I finaly saw the Salsimarz ST 10. I a dead ringer for the H&K USP. Unfortunately while it looks like fairly accurate clone of the H&P USP. It does not have the functionality of the “Universal Style Pistol”  I.e a safety lever but no decocker.  He also showed me a USP as well. Bout 80% or so. Asking 350k and NIB 400K \nHe was offering a plain vanilla Cougher (Black w/o rails) 65k. CF NIB 44k and Kanuni 2 tone in 65k\nP.S. Knew all about Gun forums: In his opinion losers hang out at those…\n\n[B]Haris :[/B]\n The man was busy (I think) Girsan 21 & 23 Not available. Zigana F 75k M1919 65k Hatsan MP A Not available. I saw a 24/7 in the display case and ask him if he had it.. He said No. I realized he really did not like being disturbed. I left.\n\n[B]TNT Arms:[/B]\nThe gent was more helpful then the last time I went there. He deals more or less exclusively in local products. Every weapon there had the Legend “Gul” in a little sunflower on his gun. He was selling Seiga 12 and AK-47 Shotgun knock offs at 28k apiece. Asked us to take em home and shoot to our hearts’ content and if satisfied to pay later, He claimed they had been made from Russian Machine guns. Well the barrels  must have been pretty badly chopped up cause I could see multiple welding  joints where the melted metal had been covered in a thin layer of paint. The bolt was rusty as was the folding stock. In fact most of it was covered in rust. He made the usual claim that-his-products-were-the best –in-the-market. And the firing pins and extractors were all made In USA!! What u got was a so-callled American Russian hybrid that would put a vodka soaked Siberian to shame. Honestly speaking I really cant understand why they do this? To us and to themselves as well???\n\n[B]Ali Muhammad and Sons:[/B]\nThis outlet is now a subsidiary of Ammar and co. Adnan handles it as his own outlet. They have a lot of good stuff there and since they are importers at pretty reasonable rates. M1919 at 60k asking Hatsan MP 32k Plain vanilla Cougher 60k and 809 70k as well as G II at the same rate.  I also saw a Taurus  judge .410 revolver 120k. He had gotten it off Guns and accessories.  Taurus .38 special 6 shot 80k .357 and .38 bullets at Rs. 100 and  .410  shot shells at Rs. 120 each (Those things are tiny compared to a 12 guage) Adnan is a friendly chap unlike most of the jaded and cynical dealers around. He was nice enough to let us handle the weapons to our hearts’ content. A practice most dealers frown upon specially with stranger. But this may have been due to the fact that I am old customer of his Uncle’s Khuzema Bandulwala. The original  owners of Ali Muhammad and sons. \nUnlike other dealers who refused to make licenses for people below 25 years of age he has no issues as long as the person is 18+. Rate 15k Permits are Rs. 2500. \n he had to go somewhere and left us to our own devices while we were extolling the different advantages of the 809 and the cougher his father walked in with a bunch of people in tow demanding to see ‘bareeetas’ “Hamain bareeta dekhao”  His father started yelling at his absent son for leaving the store at his salesman at the boy on the counter… he seems quite fond of it. Yelling I mean.. Before he started on us we decided to slink away. Highly recommended.. Good service reasonable prices. But do check and make sure Papa is not around before you walk in. \n\n[B]Famous arms:[/B]\n\nA slightly under the weather Mehmood bhai was sitting  alone in the shop.. He seems quite upset about the abduction of a fellow dealer in the market.. He felt like talking. We  were only too eager to oblige. He had some pretty decent Seiga 12 and ak style shot gun knock offs9(The term ‘decent knock-off” sounds a bit like an oxymoron does’nt it) Asking price 18k and the quality was better.. Much better then the stuff at TNT. He has his own service centre adjacent to the shop. And gives a 3 month replacement warrenty for his weapons and also a lifetime service warranty for all his products including small parts such as pins and extractors. He also offered to test fire the weapon before purchase. A practice that most dealers balk from where shotguns are concerned. \n\n[B]Bashir Khan and Co.[/B]\nA trader rather like TNT offering similar products. T similar prices. Claimed that no 144 has been imposed in Karachi and all licences are closed. He had a TT he called “naga Parbat” partly cause she had heart shaped holes in the slide and was supposedly matt chrome.. Only it turned out to be some sort of light gray colur with little bubbles etched in it. He was selling the Zigana f for around 80k. His products were known by the name of “Chamkani” \nLocal bullets rs. 30 and Chinese Rs. 40\n\n[b]Mega Armoury:[b] \nI dropped in at my old ''friend'' danish at Mega.. The minute we walked in They gave each other a “oh-no-not-him-again-look ..oooohh we are just closing..Do come back on Monday… M1919  65k (With customers like U we have to have room to maneuvere its not like U are going to give me what I ask) DC License 18k irrespective of age. \n\n[B]Conclusion:[/B] \n\nZiganas and Girsans and other Turkish offerings are just bout and in some cases slightly more then Taurus.  70 to 80k range. \nMost dealers  are vary of firing slugs in Turkish shotguns.. Specially M1919. The market is evenly spread b/w dealers who are not willing to make licences for people below 25 and those who are willing to do so.\n\nRest I will continue when I pick up my shotgun on Tuesday.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Nice guy. \nI saw some ak shotguns being taken from TNT to Famous, may be they have the same suppliers.\nFamous also gets some local made clones of SIG, STOGER, ZiGANA etc from GH Arms (Gul Haji) factory in peshawar.\n\ni talked to the GH arms owner(aimad) last week. I asked about a good local 9mm bullet. He said BBF was good but not anymore. Asked to try some STAR brand 9mm bullets.[/QUOTE]\n\nHmmm So Famous arms has the same Haji Gul as the supplier for his clones as well.. Only difference b/w the 2 is that TNT was charging 26-28K for his clones while Mehmood Bhai was charging 16 to 17k for the same. giving free spare parts and 3 months warranty on his products. When U buy local. After sales service is very very important indeed. And he did not give me any outlandish nonsense about ''American firing pins and Russian machine gun barrels. \n\nHell M.G barrels are grooved while shotgun barrels are smooth bores! Unless the Russians are using simple ''pipes'' as barrels for their M.Gs!!!\n\nHe also claimed that the stuff was manufectured at their own facility in KP. When i pointed out Gul''s logo. He said Gul is just  a karigar (workman) who is fond of putting his name on their guns. \n\nJudging my the sheer volume of "Gul" logo bearing shotguns there. I am sure Mr. Gul must be a very very prolific worker indeed. \n\n Just because we were wearing pants and shirts was no reason to treat us like idiots! \n\nHowever Mehmood bhai completely failed to mention that his supplier and TNT''s were one and the same.... \n\nAs regards the ST 10. It does look good and unlike the original USP it has universal picatinny rails the kind that accept most accessories.\n\nhmm he told me the original Ghulam Ali and sons sold the business some time back. Though it goes back to 1906. \n\nI say Muhammad M. If ever u talk to Mr. Aimad at haji Gul do ask him which of his guns should be bought.. Some pieces like the Saiga 12 did look reasonable but some were obvious junk. I have no idea about the internals of any of em... I would love to know what the manufacturer would recommend. \n\nAs regards the pistol clones. i think I''l pay him a visit to see what he recommends..\n\nAs regards Mega Arms..

(446138, ' @Ameer\nBro, from what you''ve described, seems to me you have issues with trigger control. Of all the 7 fundamentals of shooting, [B]THE[/B] most important is trigger control; [B]Skeeter60[/B] Sir once told me that trigger control is 60% of the game!\n\nUnfortunately, trigger control is also [B]THE[/B] most difficult fundamental to master. I still haven''t completely  mastered it, despite being a very regular shooter. But, from personal experience, I have learned a few things:-\n\n1) First off, know that the human hand contains [B]NO[/B] muscles; we articulate our fingers and thumbs via tendons which stretch all the way up to the muscles in our forearms. Therefore, the trick is to "isolate" the trigger finger so that your forearm doesn''t shake.\n2) As a rule of thumb, make sure that the center of the first digit of your trigger finger is placed on the trigger, not a joint or a knuckle. I know it''s not intuitive or instinctive, but it''s the best way to "isolate" the trigger finger.\n3) Pull, not squeeze, the trigger; that way you''ll pull the trigger straight back instead of "curling" your finger on it, which will remove any "curling" effect on your primary hand.\n4) Be gentle, and don''t rush your trigger pull. Be calm and relaxed, and gently pull the trigger rearwards. Take all the time in the world.\n5) As practice, I recommend pasting a small target on your wall and slowly dry firing your gun. I personally do dry fire drills everyday for atleast 2 hours every night.\n6) Lastly, give yourself time to master the trigger. Don''t be impatient with yourself, give yourself the learning time and space. Manipulating a trigger, initially, is quite counter-intuitive. So just relax and let it come to you naturally, don''t rush yourself.\n\nI sincerely this helps you out bro.', ''),

(446178, 'Kim Rhode Wins Gold in Women''s Skeet, Makes US Olympic History I first saw her on her own skeet range in Ronald Lee Ermey documentary series "Lock N'' Load with R. Lee Ermey", which focused on the development of different types of weapons. An inspiring video for Pakistani women in sports shooting.\n\nWhen Kim Rhode, then 17, stood on the podium at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta with her first gold medal hanging from her neck, she never dreamed 16 years later she would make history in London at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, but that''s exactly what happened Sunday morning. \n\nRhode, 33, set a new Olympic record in qualifying for Women''s Skeet with 74 hits out of 75. She went on to match her own world record with a perfect 25 in the final for a total of 99 out of 100, winning the gold. \n\nShe is the first U.S. athlete in history to medal in an individual sport at five consecutive Olympic Games. \n\nBefore today, Rhode had collected two gold medals in the Double Trap event in 1996 and 2004, a bronze in 2000 and a silver in the Skeet at the Beijing 2008 games, cementing herself as one of the best competitive shotgun shooters in the world. And she''s not done yet.\n \n"I do not see myself quitting any time soon," Rhode says on the official Olympics website. "I''m looking forward to 2016 and a few more after that.

I carry out this practice before start of each shoot even after 36 years of shotgunning and believe me, it helps. as for pistol shooting cross eye dominance doesnt count because in that in any case you are firing with a deliberate aim and with left eye closed. most likely your problem lies with trigger control (99 % of pistol shooting is about trigger control)', ''),

However, the grip area is completely the opposite-it is curvy and has curvy lines and patterns on it as opposed to the looks of the top half of the gun. this simply was never going to look right in my eyes anyway. of course, it is to the taste of many people...caracal owners! sorry i don''t mean to cause any offence in any way whatsoever, and this is just my honest opinion. i hope the next time i return here, there will be a new caracal which i can purchase-fingers crossed.[/QUOTE]\n\nNo need to say sorry bro.

(627602, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;464336]Hi guys, the PX3 is now available in Canada, however it goes by the name of P762 by Dominion Arms. They are a very good value at $300, and I''m very interested in picking one up. However, it''s not available at any of the stores in my area, so I''ll have to order online. The only problem with that is, I will not have the opportunity to handle one before deciding. It looks nice enough in the pictures I''ve seen, but my concern is the grip size. Part of the reason I like TT''s and 1911''s so much is because of their single stack mags, and hence slim grips. I don''t have very large hands, with the 7.62 being a relatively long cartridge and having two columns, I''m afraid the gun won''t fit me.

Glad to see you now have a place for you and your Piranha to get better acquainted. :)\n\nAs for ammo, I''ve fired S&B (115gr & 124gr), Barnaul, PoF Mk1Z and Chinese Redbox with my Piranha. Of these, the best I found was the S&B 115gr and Barnaul (they''re almost identical and great ammo). I''m currently using Redbox because of it''s lower price (Rs. 38-40/round here in Lahore) and it''s shooting perfectly. If I were to compare S&B/Barnaul and Redbox, the big difference would be that the Chinese round is slightly "hotter", meaning it has slightly greater velocity and a flatter trajectory, but it''s also as dirty as a year-old used diaper! :p\n\nBottomline: If you strictly want performance and money isn''t an issue, then go for either S&B 115gr or Barnaul.

Note              that by using a larger steel shot size, comparable velocity and              retained energy at desired yardages are maintained.  By              carefully studying this chart, you can compare the retained energy              for steel and lead shot of the same size (e.g., Steel 2 vs. Lead 2),              and prove to yourself why a larger steel shot size must be used to              yield similar retained-energy values.[/SIZE][/FONT] [/CENTER]  [/TD]\n           [TD="width: 50%"]             [CENTER][IMG]http://shotshell.drundel.com/images/enrcomp.jpe[/IMG][/CENTER][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/CENTER]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n   [TR]\n     [TD="width: 100"]       \n[/TD]\n     [TD="width: 528"]       [CENTER]              [TABLE="width: 528"]\n                  [TR]\n           [TD="width: 153"]             [CENTER][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3][B]COMPARATIVE PATTERNING              PERFORMANCE*\nSTEEL VS.

However, since the steel shot is much harder, it stays              round, and flies truer to the target.  At 40 yards, a higher              percentage of steel pellets will be on target (within a 30" circle)              than lead loads.

Steel shot, because it is three times harder than              lead, stays round, and develops a shot string that is 50-60% shorter              and 60-70% narrower than lead.  Or, looking at it another way,              steel provides a much more precise "hitting zone" than you''d get              with lead shot.   We recommend that you practice shooting              with steel shot so you can get used to its compact, hard-hitting              "sweet spot" before hunting season.[/SIZE][/FONT][/CENTER]             [CENTER][IMG]http://shotshell.drundel.com/images/leadpath.jpe[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://shotshell.drundel.com/images/stlpath.jpe[/IMG][FONT=Arial][SIZE=3][/SIZE][/FONT][/CENTER][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/CENTER]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[FONT=Verdana][SIZE=2]\n[/SIZE][/FONT]', ''),

After that it will goto DCO for approval, if approved then you have to get a police report done by your local police station that is a lengthy process but could be done in a day if you have a contact. After that arms dept will ask for the tickets worth 5000 and you will get your license.\n\nWhat I did for my license recently that I wrote an application and went right to the DCO for getting the approval. He was satisfied for the reason I gave and signed my application, rest I went through the same process I mentioned.[/QUOTE]\nPolice report is a part of application which must be completed before the final approval of D.C.O.\nOnce you submit the application Suprintendent of Arms branch or D.O.C. but not the D.C.O., mark it for the police report.

I owned guns from glock, cz, colt, para,detonix etc. etc.. But nowadays i asked myself why do i even bought a gun? the answer is not to be a show off as to how my gun looks aesthetically but for my family and personal protection. Why do any of us buy guns? i bet the main reason would be the same as mine. As to my experience with caracal c, it is so far the best handgun ive ever own with the reasons below : \n\n[COLOR=#0000ff][B]1.) smooth trigger\n2.) very low recoil \n3.) doesn''t jam even at 1,000 rds using factory or reloads and different gr''s\n5.) easy to clean and maintain\n6.) very robust design\n7.) packs a 15+1 ammo very good for ccw\n8.) QS very effective design for fast acquisition particularly in CQB situations\n[/B][/COLOR]\nagain i am not saying that caracal is the best, but i believe you should choose a handgun that you can shoot accurately and can be used to its main purpose, which is to protect yourself  and your family, and for me THAT IS THE CARACAL C.  THERE IS NO BEST AMONG THE REST HANDGUN in the world, there is only THE BEST HANDGUN for you and you alone. whichever handgun  you are comfortable shooting with and have the most highest accuracy would be the best handgun for you regardless of how it look or where its made. just my two cents.[/QUOTE]\n\nvery well highlighted the things,', ''),

Glad to see you now have a place for you and your Piranha to get better acquainted. :)\n\nAs for ammo, I''ve fired S&B (115gr & 124gr), Barnaul, PoF Mk1Z and Chinese Redbox with my Piranha. Of these, the best I found was the S&B 115gr and Barnaul (they''re almost identical and great ammo). I''m currently using Redbox because of it''s lower price (Rs. 38-40/round here in Lahore) and it''s shooting perfectly. If I were to compare S&B/Barnaul and Redbox, the big difference would be that the Chinese round is slightly "hotter", meaning it has slightly greater velocity and a flatter trajectory, but it''s also as dirty as a year-old used diaper! :p\n\nBottomline: If you strictly want performance and money isn''t an issue, then go for either S&B 115gr or Barnaul.

Heck NO.\n3.  recoil part is very much a place in the mind of the person shooting UNLESS one gets a ransom rest and actually checks the degrees of tilts per weapon(s) so thats out too.\n4.  15+1 capacity is a norm on many guns these days, that is nothing to boast about... its like screaming out... hey everyone my car has wheels!!  lolz.\n5.  the QS sights are nothing new, rather renamed copy of the ASP pistol from the late 70s era, they NEVER caught on.  There are some other ones out there now as well but the norm is the norm... meaning regular sights.\nLastly, bhai, re watch all the videos, the gun DID jam and more than ONCE.  Don''t turn a blind eye to it.  And definately don''t make some of us actually give you the actual timeline in the Utube videos showing the jams.\nI am glad you love the Caracal, I will state again, its the best value for money, but buying one and then running around defending it or trying to other things that are better is not the right thing.

I have another question though, how can I release both hammer springs? I have only receiver and barrels as the wooden parts are being re-finished.

(446981, ' The longest test of a pistol and simplest is the test by the serious users. Here the military takes the lead. Caracal is no doubt a serious competitor to the Glock series; but NO competition IF the glock was selling at its real price or at same price as caracal.\nHowever if sturdyness is taken then Viking and CZ999 take the lead from every other gun. Taurus 24/7 are at the bottom as in 3 years the 9mm version with the ribbing grip becomes so bad that i wouldnt want anyone to see me with that gun.\nI have seen LOCAL PG ammo go through cz999 to about 400 rounds in a day at the range with about 400 of chinese red box through a friends gun and it easily digests. the trigger of Viking is a LOT better than caracal''s.\nMost of the people who buy a gun treat it with a LOT of care and dont test it as a platform to practise with. I am of the school of thought that if you choose a gun then it should work flawlessly with the ammo you choose and it should be severely reliable. I shot 1200 rounds in a day all local mix brands in a day and stopped when locking lug spring broke. The gun DID NOT stop firing it was in perfect working order even then. I have NO doubts that both caracal and viking will stand this test.. I have seen the ejector of a caracal break with local ammo... as local ammo is filled TOO much with the durmal (propellant) giving a severe kick and ear splitting high pitch bang.\nTesting a gun also involves high speed shooting of mags one after another; in addition to number of rounds and this happens only in the practical shooting event/ drills. the worst condition i saw was a taurus slim 9mm i think 709 it is NOT a gun just a badnumaa daagh..\nCaracal gun internal pars are thin and need time to see what they result in after they have seen a fair share of shooting plus availability of parts because caracal internals are harder to replicate from local gunsmiths as metal hardening is NEVER done properly.', ''),

(447351, 'My DCA (Sindh) License Confusion As most of you know the whole story of getting a license from TA. It has finally arrived after 2.5 months. Here is the thing:\n\n1. There is no NBP seal on my license, I asked Rabbi he said its not needed and I can purchase form anywhere directly on this license. Issue date of this license is "28-12-2011" (written on page 12) while I applied on 27th May 2012.\n\n2. On page # 18, "Date on which license expires" is 31-12-2012. Its written by a pan in handwritting with no stamp on it. When asked about, Rabbi said its no issue.\n\n3. Page # 19 is stamped (4x) one of them states "Home Minister Quota", and other one has 3 rows looks like a payment stamp worth 4500 with receipt number and date of "28-12-2011".\n\n4. On page # 11, My photo is stamped ("Commissioner Karachi Division Karachi") and signed as well.\n\n5. Most of the copy is filled with manual writing from a pen such as page # 17 which defines ammunition that is "50 P/A" with enough space to make it "500" (however I have decided to not play with it at all).\n\nAfter taking it from Rabbi, at that point he said its now possible to buy weapon directly but instead I decided to take it to "Ali Muhammad & Sons" shop at Lucky Star which I have very friendly experience of (I went there with Engagement Desires) bro on survey a week ago. I didn''t find same person but there was a guy called Nadeem or I don''t exactly remember name (but sure starts from "N") who said he will still renew license and get NBP stamp on it, increase ammo to 250 and get me a pink slip from NBP and some other process which will cost me 4500.', ''),

(447366, 'Lucky Star Arms Market survey Part VII This Tuesday MIG, Usama and Canik decided to do a spot of surveying.\n\nThese are the results. If I have forgotten anything I would like MIG and Usama to add anything they like to it.\n\nWe went to [b]Shaheen[/b]. A tiny little shoplet on main Mansfield street. Usama bhai wanted his air gun repaired. Shaheen told us to go Mustafa traders. He had some pretty expensive hardware for such a small shop.   Gamos and Dianas ranging from 63k to 96k. I had no idea air guns were this expensive. \nHe said he will have some air pistols (Gamo) available in the next few weeks.\n\n[b]Mustafa Traders:[/b]\n\nHe had what I wanted. A used CF 98. His asking price was 34k. Did not bother to show me the weapon. Simply gave me his card and asked me to cal him back with my offer.  Had a Zigana F clone Pretty neat. At first sight I mistook it for the original. Asking 26k And a reasonable looking CF clone asking 20k \nHow he is with air guns. I guess Usama would be able to tell us further. Was not interested n procuring licenses or permits.\n\nWe went to [b]International Arms Company[/b] but they were out of stock of just about everything&#8230;. Very surprising really since the outlet was full of customers \nTried [b]Haji Abdur Rehman[/b] and same answer. They deal only in locals and asked us to come next week since their shipment is due then. \n\nThen it was [b]New Shaheen arms[/b]. The dealer claims to be a wholesaler. He had few weapons in stock. Offered us a CF for 41k. \nAnd a Zig clone that looked like a bloated TT in .30 bore. Refused to even consider helping out with 144 permits or had anything to do with licenses. Would not even have the weapon registered at the HD.  Just stamp the license and that&#8217;s it. \n\n[b]Moonstar Arms Company[/b]\n\nThey are Moon Star&#8217;s Factory outlet and have some excellent local shotguns. However Khan sahib is in a class all by himself. I am an old customer of his but he remembers the fact that I have visited his outlet without buying stuff&#8230; A few months back. \nHe had some really nice shotties. And I have heard that his Moonstar brand of local pistols are pretty good. me, Usama and MIG got a taste of his ''temper'' Even though I am old customer he really does not like people who come and browse and not buy. Even though MIG bought a couple of mags (TT local) from him he was not mollified.\n When I wanted to see some stuff the sahib said something in pusto to the attendant and they started laughing at us..\nthe 3 of us. viz. Usama , Mig and I were scolded as well.. He won&#8217;t even take a gun out of the window. I had to do this myself. and as regards handguns. I kept telling him how much his Berretta clone is appreciated and how it has a reputation of being amongst the best clones in the market. before I managed to coax him to let me see it.\nits so freaking difficult getting him to show something on his own. Last time I went to him I had mentioned that I have heard that his betty clones are good. But that was not reason enough to persuade him to show em to me.. \n\nThis time we was prepared. We told him that I have heard they are the very ''bestest-est'' clones in the market. And the rest are useless in comparison. And I have heard so much about em that I will definitely make em my SD/HD weapon. If he would consider them good enough for his purpose. Since he knows better then I do. Etc et. Then he consented to ask some1 to put a betty clone in front of me.\n\nPlease bear in mind that I am an old customer of his. And even now we purchased a couple of mags from him. He claimed that what ever local stuff we buy he can give it cheaper. But &#8220;Tum loag Pathan per aitbaar nahi karta&#8221;  U people don&#8217;t trust pathans.. Heck had I not trusted him I would never have bought from him. His Saiga 12 clone final rate was 22k and for the AK style 20k . The betty clone was 20 as well. Don&#8217;t know much bout other clones since he never did show em.  Not interested in helping out with lics or permits an all that\nThe concept "The customer is always right" is as alien to him as Martians on the Lyari Expressway\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cQDvBrVCCM&feature=g-vrec&context=G2c3afe7RVAAAAAAAADA[/url]\n A video of the Moonstar arms company manufacturing facility in KPK\n\n[b]Majid Latif and sons[/b]\nHe is a nice old man who remembered me from my vist a couple of months back. Had taken my number too. Fliped though the pages and found me there. Liked the fact that I patronized his shop. However barring a Danish pump action for 7.5k He had noting to display at that point in time. And unlike last time he was not forthcoming about lics and permits. But after some small talk he said things can be worked out. \n\nThis concluded the first part of our visit. Usama had to leave and me and Mig continued for our rendezvous  with Canik for our review of Tactical Arms. Which I wil share later tonight.', ''),

Is testing after service is a must, or you just can be confident that it will work fine and no malfunctions will occur?\nNinth, if there could be any malfunctions due to striping only, what could be these as regarding SD, this means life?', ''),

You may need to turn the offending barrel ejector adjustment screw an additional half turn to prevent whichever condition from occurring.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend cutting the ejector springs. It takes 300 to 500 rounds for the action to loosen up. It will continue to loosen for another 500. After that it will swing open like a Browning.

(447556, ' Okies. Yours is a fairly simple question that requires quite a detailed answer.\n\nWe will start with pistols\n\nThere are different types of safties for different guns. First lets go though the kinds of hand guns in the \n the Pakistani market while keeping your budget in mind\n\n SA\n\nSA (Single Action) \n\nThe single action pistol requires that you cock it I.e pull back the hammer before the first shot. The trigger only releases the hammer but does not pull it back.  Every subsequent shot will automatically cock the weapon and U dont have to pull it back every time. \n\nThe most common example of this system is the Tokerov Tule model of 1933 Commonly reffered to as the TT. It has an 7 shot magazine and is the least expensive item around.. rates start from 4k (Used pak made) to 40k (Zastava & Russian) The most common is the Chinese TT costing 20k approx. NIB (new in box)\n\nDA (Double Action)\n\nIn this type of weapon the Trigger is capable of pulling back the hammer as well as releasing it. Most 9mms in your budget are DAs\n\nNow on to safeties\n\nInternal safeties:\n\nFiring pin block\n\nA firing pin block is a mechanical block used in semi-automatic firearms and some revolvers that, when at rest, obstructs forward travel of the firing pin, but is linked to the trigger mechanism and clears the obstruction to the pin just before the hammer or striker is released. This prevents the firing pin from striking a chambered cartridge unless the trigger is pulled, even if the hammer is released due to a faulty sear or the pin is dropped or struck by another object.\n\nHammer block\n\nA hammer block is similar to a firing pin block. It is a latch, block or other obstruction built into the action and normally positioned to prevent the hammer contacting the cartridge primer or firing pin when at rest. Similar to the firing pin block, the obstruction to the hammer''s travel is removed as a consequence of pulling the trigger. This allows the hammer to contact the primer or firing pin only when the trigger is pulled.\n\nDecocker: A decocke is lever that when manipulated correctly will decock the weapon I.e switch it from SA to DA mode\n\nExternal safety: This feature when applied effectively either blocks the firing mechanism or disconnects it all together. \n\nLCI (Loaded chamber indicator) It shows if there is a round in the chamber or not.\n\nThe TT has none of the above safety features. No firing pn block no hammer block no decocker. if u drop it it wil fire if U decock it and your hand slips it will fire. It does have a hammer half cock safety, but if the weapon falls on the hammer it may disengage. \n\nCanik C100/L120 are pretty nice guns clones of the formidable CZ line up. They are equipped with a manual safety But no decocker. I.e u have to decock the weapon manually with your thumb..  highly accurate Price around 50k\n\nThe NP 22/ NP34 / HP77 series\n\nthese are also around 44 to 50k or so NIB excellent weapons Made in china. SIG clones..Very sturdy.. very realiable bult like tanks spacialy the HP77 A big heavy all steel affair.  Unlike the Caniks They do have Decockers.. but no manual safety. i.e If u are carrying with a round in the chamber there is no lever to flip on or off. u simply  point and shoot.

Then I pushed the small metal which is at the bottom of the receiver and moved the lever to the center position.

It boils down to what you feel comfortable with and, more importantly, what you think you can handle safely.\n\nAs a newbie to the gun world, and this is just my opinion, one should lean towards hammer fired weapons that have external safeties and decockers.

But its depends on the size of the guy using the gun aswell. Now if your big well built guy then even you might be able to conceal a glock even. But if your a timid guy then even a cougar might be showing from behind your clothes.\r\n\r\nFor S.D and H.D it depends on the situation in which the user is IMHO........most of the times the enemy would be in your face in SD situation hence you''ll need a gun which you can get your hands on quickly, hold firmly plus easily and instantly put the bugger down with a bullet.\r\n\r\nNow home defense can be like a medium range shoot out between you and the bugger for which you might require a gun which is accurate beyond 25meters!!\r\nWell this is what i think.........not saying this is the real core principal!\r\n\r\nAs far as external hammer and internat hammer thing goes, toh what i''ve learned from my uncle''s who are gun enthusiasts is that the ammo we get in pakistan usually is of low quality which screws up guns with internal hammers.

(447758, ' Salam All,\nI am sooo happy everyone had a great time.  I am sorry guys, I even got to lahore at 10am on Saturday.  I met Naveed bhai with PG Members coming out of Hira Arms as I was getting ready to go in.  Soon after Ahnab arrived there as well with Rmishaq on the way to Nila as well.  We figured hey plenty of time... God was I wrong to think that everything was fine....\nIshaq bhai called up from Para and asked me to hurry over there.  As Ahnab and I got up and looked outside... words can''t come to mind the sight we were seeing.  Both his Honda City and My Civic were surrounded by atleast 2.5feet of water (thats higher than the door floor sill).  Soo we ran opened the door to get in and quite a bit of water entered the car with us.  As we started the car and backed out of parking I noticed the car was floating more than driving... lolz.  We drove out and the water kept on rising till NOT EVEN THE WHEELS of the car were showing anymore.  A bus passed me and the water WAVE not splash WAVE made my front hood disappear for a sec giving me the scare that something might short out or in my case (driving auto) the car might shut down.  I called Ishaq up and said sorry lets get the heck outta here.  He too left out.  Ahnab called me on the phone and told me to follow him out and lets go to his house.  By that time, water had entered the car to the point where from the knees down I couldn''t see anything.  Still the car kept on going as did Ahnab''s.  It took us two hours to get from Hira to GORII.  RmIshaq got home at about 9:30pm a good 5 hours stuck in traffic.  As soon as I got to Ahnab''s home, I started to drain water out of my car with the car started... then the car finally gave out and died.  Called an electrician, he came about an hour or so later, there was a contact point which was shorted as the water did finally seep in the circuitry.  I finally got to leave lahore (took a chance) at about 10pm.  And got home at about 3am.  Today the entire day has been spent dis-assembling and washing out the interior of the car.\nI would like to apologize and say thanks to Ahnab (thanks again for taking me to your home, meal and the mechanic) & Rmishaq (its because of me they missed the GTG, its also because of me that they were at Nilagumbad that their cars got damaged).  I would also like to say thanks to Abbas bhai for offering me a car and driver for tow to anywhere.  Denovo bhai thanks for offering to pick us up, we mainly refused because you too would have missed the GTG by being stuck in the ridiculous traffic.\nAnd now for pics....\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/8-2.jpg[/IMG]\nimage taken upon finally entering a road with no water.\n[url]http://youtu.be/9Q3cBPiYspQ[/url]\nvideo taken after reaching Ahnab''s house two hours later\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/5-1.jpg[/IMG]\ntaking things apart this morning\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/6-3.jpg[/IMG]\ntaking more water out of car\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-9.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/7-1.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

We had a pre Iftar gup shup session followed by a great Iftar menu, prayers followed by an even better dinner.

That is that only way forward to grow into and surpass world class firearms enthusiasts as not everyone can afford (in time, or in money, or in experience) what a few have the luxury to learn. It is the duty and greatness of those fortunate few to pass it on so the community can learn and grow.   \n\nI would also request guests and friends to look at our GTG pictures and note the quality of our members MashAllah.

Which one is good for everyday use conceal carry??\n\nIs Glock 19 really worth the extra money??[/QUOTE]\n\nThe Glocks are really what you can call a "Gadha Mar" Pistols, shoot a 1000 rounds non-stop and they won''t die ( provided with proper cartridges , not those darra reloads ). On the other hand, the problem I''ve faced with glocks ( own a 17 ) is that they''re  made of polymer frame, that makes them light, which on  one hand makes it an easy carry , and is the pistol of choice for many police officers around the globe, it backfires. Backfires in the sense that the balance is not that good and you actually feel the blowback/recoil much more. \n\nCZ75s however, while being made of all metal, are heavy, but I like the balance and grip on them, and hence are very good to shoot. So if you''re looking for a concealed carry and self defense, get a glock ( even Gen 3 is equally as good ). But if weight is not an issue, and if I were you, I''d rather look into other options like Beretta 92FS or Taurus 917 as well. At the end of the day, the decision is up to you. Glock 17/19 has so many mods, but you''ll always be stuck with the same polymer frame and the grip is a bit tricky. I like the grip on CZ75 and also the balance. Plus , you can actually buy all three mentioned above and give them a try :D.', ''),

In our part of the world where Safe action handguns are a luxury for blessed few, the VASTER majority of handguns circulated have manual safeties mounted.\n\nAnd the world stretches much farther than the spheres of eastern block TT lovers.\n\nOver the past 3 years or so, I''ve personally witnessed 5 gun accidents, one past month over here with a Beretta 92, bullet hitting the main artery through thighs of senior enthusiast, leading to death, and another incident involving an army officer, also leading to death.\n\nOnly 1 of these 5 cases involved a TT, and none involved luxury Glock.

(448151, ' [COLOR=#222222][FONT=Times]@AK47 bro If you scroll just two post above your last post, you''d see that I admitted to being biased. And since (by some piece of luck) my post got in before yours, you don''t get points for this.\nNow!! Onwards to the discussion on safeties and guns with safeties causing majority of ND; my NCC instructor in college once said (loosely translated into English because typing roman punjabi on the phone is difficult) "a guns'' safe usage is directly proportional to the experience and intelligence of the wielder" ... Although certain terms he used were not polite so this is a verrry lose translation :)\nCase being, and no offence to anybody who got hurt, incorrect handling of a gun is the cause of negligent discharge not the presence/absence of safeties. Having a gun and not know how to use it in emergencies is IMHO worse than not having a gun at all.\n\nSo in short, I don''t agree with the random statement you made because it seems to me that the statement was made just to validate how awesome the Caracal is for not having an external safety and how it automatically becomes perfect for everyone.\n \nIf guns shouldnt have safeties, then what in the world are gun manufacturers doing putting em on guns!? Surely they must know something that we missed or perhaps Caracal will open their eyes to the ultimate truth that the Caracal is the holy grail for solving problems they never had.\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

Apologies for that.\n\nThat being said, the argument here is the premise that if the presence of safety on a gun is useless because people have had NDs with guns that have safeties. That''s akin to saying that, since car accidents happen because people fail to apply the brake in time, we should not have brakes in cars. So instead of trying to address the improper usage we end up increasing the probability of an incident....hmmm!!! I''m unable to connect the dots there but that''s probably because I''m not that we''ll versed with guns without a safety or decocker anyway.\n\nYour preference for not having safeties on guns is just that: a preference. In the context of a discussion and putting it forward as a "point of view", especially from a senior members like yourself who actually hold a lot of weight for me along with other newbies and amateurs, there should be some sound reasoning behind it.\nYou''re right in saying that this discussion is for another thread and I''m also not the best qualified to pursue this further coz I just used up all of my knowledge on the subject :).

(448305, ' [QUOTE=rmishaq;286436]AK47 bro!! I am always calm so no worries there :)\nOk so may be the Caracal statement was presptuous of me. Apologies for that.\n\nThat being said, the argument here is the premise that if the presence of safety on a gun is useless because people have had NDs with guns that have safeties. That''s akin to saying that, since car accidents happen because people fail to apply the brake in time, we should not have brakes in cars. So instead of trying to address the improper usage we end up increasing the probability of an incident....hmmm!!! I''m unable to connect the dots there but that''s probably because I''m not that we''ll versed with guns without a safety or decocker anyway.\n\nYour preference for not having safeties on guns is just that: a preference. In the context of a discussion and putting it forward as a "point of view", especially from a senior members like yourself who actually hold a lot of weight for me along with other newbies and amateurs, there should be some sound reasoning behind it.\nYou''re right in saying that this discussion is for another thread and I''m also not the best qualified to pursue this further coz I just used up all of my knowledge on the subject :). I leave this to your expertise and experience.[/QUOTE]\n\nAOA,I agree with Mr.AK47, and I think most people missed the  point, the point isnt that people get into accidents in cars due to failing to apply brakes in time, its becuz people are careless/reckless/sleepy/drunk/complacent/over speeding in a residential area etc, so in that case hving brakes or not isn''t going to change the outcome( i.e the car getting in an accident).  \nThere is a reason why people that hv handled firearms all their lives religiously insist on people obeying the 4 laws of Gun safety, none of which include buying guns with multiple mechanical safeties :\nThe 1st Law - The Gun Is Always Loaded!\nThe 2nd Law - Never Point The Gun At Something You Are Not Prepared To Destroy!\nThe 4th Law - Keep Your Finger Off The Trigger Until Your Sights Are On The Target!\n\nEVERY SINGLE ND involves a violation of one of these 3, irrespective of how many safeties a gun has on it. ND''s tend to be rare events at Gun ranges becuz people are being Careful, and then they go home/go out and start ignoring these laws. These Rules are to be applied Everywhere. \n[b]People Suggesting a Certain Gun is Safe to Handle compared to Another becuz of Number of Safeties , are wholly missing the point.[/b]\n\nNow just to over-blow the whole Safeties on a gun debate thing ,with a gun hving multiple Safeties, All engaged It would be really safe if u carried the gun in a Safe in your car, with the Key hidden in Another Safe inside your home , and  Effectively , reducing the probabality of a ND to Zero, And ALSO limiting the usefulness of ur SD Weapon to Zero too.\n\nAll in All, If u plan on being complacent/casual, get a gun with multiple manual safeties, but remember that will never mean ur gun is Now SAFE in all circumstances (in All honesty, people that become complacent are the ones that get into ND situations, some just outa pure bad luck, and a some due to bad/broken/non-functional Safeties.)\n\nTrue Safety doesn''t exist, u can only minimize the Risk''s, not by buying a gun with multiple safeties, But by practising the 4 laws of safe gun handling ( and not depending on mechanical Safeties to Always work , at all time) .\n\nback on topic ,the tp 9 seems like a promising entry. But I didn''t really like the finishing on it :(  \nRegards.', ''),

(448328, ' These gun models were the prime weapons of 70 era and were the solid side autos beside wheeling guns. Well, handling any old piece, one literally holds history in their hands.   Due to their popularity the local gun smiths especially of Darra Adam Khail, started manufacturing of local clones,  fakes and beside metallurgy they lacked the skill in embossing the actual writing / numbers in a refined manner. The alignment of writing was another indicator but beside all above they were widely accepted all over the country . The designs and calibers were best to choose by the enthusiasts of that time, even me not an exception once i was able to lay hand on them in mid 80 as they were still popular by that time. It is interesting to note that fake models manufactured in indo-Pak subcontinent, Afghanistan are still valued despite wrong inscription of words , dis-alignment , wrong markings, poor quality of engraving, spelling errors etc , may be to acknowledge the skills of those craftsmen.

Though I have not allocated budget for that, but the cheapest without compromising the reliablity and performance is my preference.\n\nBy Reading some posts of Br Abbas, AK47 and other members, I got impression that 9mm is a good option. Though I fired quite some time back TT, and some heavy Weapons ;)\n\nBut, right now, my preference is Handgun and as per Br Abbas 9mm is good for new ones.\n\nSo, kindly suggest me a very reliable and good handgun. Three handguns, namely, CF98 , Stoegar Cuggar & ZIGANA (preferably LEA) is often advised. So may be these can be considered as well. Kindly share there latest prices, in Lahore and Peshawar and \none more thing that, is it possible to use Laser, silencer & light on CF98, Stoegar Cuggar & Zigana.\n\nLastly, I got a feeling that I have fear or whatever of Noise of Gun shot, or anyother loud sudden noise. So how to overcome it. Thanks.[/QUOTE]\n\nWelcome to PG Mohammad Ali Anwar bro. Regarding your question, Well the cheapest and reliable handgun would be CF98, But i would recommend you to increase you budget slightly and go for Baikal Viking MP446. There is no gun in Pakistan which is as well built as this Russian tank. Not a big fan of Stoegar''s. Although its pretty reliable, but it''s not a very accurate gun because of its rotating barrel. Zigana''s are also good guns but nothing beats Mp446. Yes you can use lasers and lights on you handguns but no silencers. You can overcome you fear of noise in 2 ways. First use earmuffs, if they don''t work then wear the earmuffs and load your handgun with live rounds mixed with snap caps. As you friend to load the mag randomly with a live round and a snap cap without you knowing. This practice will not only help you overcome you fear of noise but also help you overcoming with the flinching issues.', ''),

(448399, ' This thread has gotten [B]really [/B]interesting! I love it when we have such open debates! :) Seriously, one gets to learn so much!\n\nWhen I first started CC-ing (I''ve always carried chambered since day one), I used to do so with the safety on. Now, considering that in a DA/SA gun the "hammer down" itself is a safety of sorts, I still felt I wasn''t a mature or experienced enough operator to carry with the safety off. But with the passage of time (and after God knows how many draw drills), I eventually felt that I''m now competent enough to start carrying with the safety off.\n\nI think (and this is strictly my personal opinion), how an individual feels regarding safeties is directly dependant on his/her experience with firearms in general and how comfortable he/she is with a specific gun in particular. For example, if I start CC-in a 1911, I''ll probably start doing so not "cocked & locked", but instead with the hammer down. Later on, when I feel I''m comfortable with the 1911 will I start CC-ing "cocked & locked". I guess that''s just how my brain works works! :p\n\nBut the one thing I guess I''ll always be adamant about will be the presence of [B]some[/B] kind of external safety that you can manipulate; be it a safety lever, decocker or a hammer.', ''),

Regarding your question, Well the cheapest and reliable handgun would be CF98, But i would recommend you to increase you budget slightly and go for Baikal Viking MP446. There is no gun in Pakistan which is as well built as this Russian tank. Not a big fan of Stoegar''s. Although its pretty reliable, but it''s not a very accurate gun because of its rotating barrel. Zigana''s are also good guns but nothing beats Mp446. Yes you can use lasers and lights on you handguns but no silencers. You can overcome you fear of noise in 2 ways. First use earmuffs, if they don''t work then wear the earmuffs and load your handgun with live rounds mixed with snap caps. As you friend to load the mag randomly with a live round and a snap cap without you knowing. This practice will not only help you overcome you fear of noise but also help you overcoming with the flinching issues.[/QUOTE]', ''),

I had a look at the Zastava but even the compact version is not completely a CCW.

I also liked the Cz Rami and if I get another license made then I will be buying a Rami.\nAnyway theres not much choice in the shops due to import issues. But I managed to buy the last Cz P-01 at National Traders. He will be a shipment within a month. Once again BIG THANK YOU TO LEON[/QUOTE]\n\nCongrats on the Cz P01 Shahjee. Good advise from Leon bro. He''s a gem of a person. What was the price that you got. Also if you can plz share some pics too. Happy shooting....', ''),

(448635, ' ok coming back to the topic.\r\n\r\nBefore i say what i want to, i want to clarify one thing. I RESPECT EACH MEMBER OF PG, FROM A ROOKIE TO THE MODERATORS, AT THE SAME LEVEL.\r\n\r\nnow, we didnt get a range report, buu huu!!\r\n\r\nBut a few of my brothers said that Abbass sahab was with them and he took a detailed look at it and said that it''ll be a good gun. Also only 25 rounds were fired that day.\r\n\r\nSorry but i dont buy that! If Abbas could tell about a gun''s future performance just by looking at it, then he should be hired by law enforcement agencies all over the world to foresee the future performance of the guns. Hence no offence to anyone but dont agree to what was said.\r\n\r\nYes TP9 looks very good in hand, yes TP9 is wholesome(coz of the accessories) for the money it comes in, and yes TP9 comes from a company whose PIRANHA & C100 has impressed many people who''ve fired them. But will i spend half a lakh on something thats new, hasnt passed the test of time and i have no idea about its accuracy? NO!!!!\r\n\r\nWill i instead go for the hideous looking, ugly duckling called CARACAL?   YES!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nWhy? Because by buying caracal i get the satisfaction of an accurate striker pistol, a gun coming from a designer of glock and steyr, a gun whose company is officially opening its service station in pakistan for its customers like us! Doesnt that give us the peace of mind? Yes it does........\r\n\r\nSo no matter how much i might complain about its looks and other things that the caracal lacks in, but the TP9 has got to do alot more then bring fancy stuff in its box or look nice in the hand to make me buy it and depend on it for my self defense!\r\n\r\nI''ll repeat that i have utmost respect for abbas, because he is a pioneer in what he did, brought PG on the face of the world, but i''m just sharing my opinion.

Infact I wish a few law enforcement agencies would hire me so I could get free ammo and free guns ;)\n\nAs for my comments after playing with the TP9 for 10 mins, I think it should be a decent gun. Why do I say so ? No magic involved, I like Canik products personally, slide to frame fitting was passable, trigger was average, it''s almost a copy of a successful/reliable design, finishing was decent, sights I thought were below average, grip angle was decent, slide was good, frame was average, minor other things etc and a little bit of experience thrown in. \n\nIf you notice, I''m rating most of the important things as average then why would I think it''s a good gun ?? The answer is: Value. Price is what ultimately decides if a gun is successful. I, for example have sold all my Glocks because I simply cannot justify to myself the price they command in Pakistan. Similarly a few PakGunners were sitting the other day and we all agreed that PakGuns and Pakistan would be having an unending love affair with Caracal if it had launched at 65,000 instead of 150,000.

Stick to decent pellets, be it Gamo as that is far better than these. I''ll post some pictures later today regarding accuracy at approx 18 yards using Gamo Promagnums and Crosman Premeir HPs. Although the promagnums did not do well compared to the CPHPs but still i''d stick with these if i had to choose between these and the local/irani/afghan pellets.

Is a Glock worth the extra premium to you? As far as I am concerned, with the exception of Glock 26, I would prefer an equivalent (size wise) CZ model even if the CZ was upto 15% dearer than a Glock. But, that is my personal preference. Similarly, there are certain weapons that I would not bother with no matter how cheap they might be (again a matter of personal preferences).

And it is complete code of life, we can find many teachings which are directly related to subject and object of the PakGuns. For example, Islam strictly prohibits aiming a weapon towards a believer, Islam encourages having weapons etc and many more of such beautiful information provided by Islam. Which All PakGunners should know including me.\nSo, I very humbly request and suggest you that kindly Islamic discussions should be made and allowed, who knows how many get guidance and Abbas Bh you will be rewarded for that. Also, it will be a source of spreading the message of Islam. \n\n2ndly, Can you kindly tell me that is it possible to get Non-Prohibited bore handgun on a prohibited bore licence. As I am allowed to get Prohibited bore licence, so what do you suggest that I got PB Licence and then get NPB handgun on it or for that I have to get another NPB licence? and are the licence are issued now days?

There are some other ones out there now as well but the norm is the norm... meaning regular sights.\nLastly, bhai, re watch all the videos, the gun DID jam and more than ONCE.  Don''t turn a blind eye to it.

I owned guns from glock, cz, colt, para,detonix etc. etc.. But nowadays i asked myself why do i even bought a gun? the answer is not to be a show off as to how my gun looks aesthetically but for my family and personal protection. Why do any of us buy guns? i bet the main reason would be the same as mine.

(448926, ' Salams, to answer your questions point wise:\n\n[QUOTE]\nOne, as Abbbas Bhai said "even if you fire one round, 500 or 1000, the gun should be cleaned afterwards", so how often this stripping should be done?[/QUOTE]\n\nI''ve seen people keeping guns for decades but never even knowing how to disassemble them. They just use a brush/cleaning liquid through the barrel and around the firing pin area, wipe the gun down with a cloth and store it. It does work but stripping the gun is highly recommended after shooting as that''s the proper way to clean your gun. It takes hardly a few seconds and makes cleaning much easier. \n\n[QUOTE]\nSecond, since the firing pin and the firing pin springs, both are in a concealed chamber, how to service/lubricate this mechanism?[/QUOTE]\n\nSome guns have removable firing pins (CZ TS etc) which come out easily without any disassembly required. But not really needed for most people as they tend to gunk up or start giving problems after 3,500 to 5,000 rounds. \n\n[QUOTE]\nThird, how to clean/lubricate the trigger as well as ejection mechanism, and how often it can/would be done?[/QUOTE]\n\nI use a hard brush or an old toothbrush to clean the trigger, no need for disassembly. As for lubriction, one or two drops of oil on the trigger spring is enough. \n[QUOTE]\n\nFourth, what if the gun is not fired at all after the previous servicing, does it need the same servicing after being kept idle, if yes, how often?[/QUOTE]\n\nNot really for years if cleaned/lubricated properly before storage but I take my guns out every 6 months or so and inspect for signs of rust, wipe them down, re lubricate and store again.\n\n[QUOTE]\nFifth, are there any harms involved due to striping or it is as simple as we take bath after removing our cloths and then put them on, no damages;) [/QUOTE]\n\nNo harm, these guns are supposed to be stripped and cleaned. It''s not "a" way to do it, it''s "the" way.\n[QUOTE]\nSixth, even if all parts assembled properly, can the gun malfunction even then, just due to the striping and cleaning exercise (As according to a friend)?[/QUOTE]\n\nAny machinery can malfunction but due to stripping and cleaning, no. The simple rule is just disassemble what you need to and understand how to put back together. It''s not complicated, gun designers have made it ridiculously simple. \n\n[QUOTE]\nSeventh, again according to the same friend, this should only be done by a gunsmith:ban:, what you say?[/QUOTE]\n\nA detailed strip, yes. A field strip (general cleaning) like the one shown above no. \n\n[QUOTE]\nEighth, after this energizing work (for both the gun and the enthusiast), how to test the gun if it is working fine, when you don''t have a choice to go to the range or can''t even shoot a bullet instantly? Is testing after service is a must, or you just can be confident that it will work fine and no malfunctions will occur?[/QUOTE]\n\nAfter you reassemble your gun, just do a function check but without any ammo. i.e rack the slide a couple of times, point in a safe direction and shoot. If it fires properly it will fire properly at the range as well.\n\n[QUOTE]Ninth, if there could be any malfunctions due to striping only, what could be these as regarding SD, this means life?[/QUOTE]\n\nNo, these guns are meant to be taken apart for cleaning. Once put back together and function checked they will perform fine.\n\nRegards,\n\n@PA Thank you.', ''),

I would not attempt to do that to just any gun.

(448990, 'Hatsan Escort Magnum AS Hi\n\nI was short on budget, might get the SX3/Maxus/AL391 I actually wanted sometime later now... spent the money I had on the BSA I recently got. \n\nThe rest bit I had saved, I rate this as a good buy. Much much better looking gun than the Baikal Mp153 which initially amused me (but was in short supply in the market). The guns aesthetics are great, and the thinner forearm provides a comfortable grip. Also I like how the gun is so light even in wood stock.\n\nThis is no review, but just my initial impressions. I''m not so familiar with shotgun terms, just enjoy shooting them so pardon me for any mis-quotes. Also the review done by 12GAUGE is far more informative.\n\nThe checkering/engraving is commendable for such a cheap shotgun. Taking advantage of the sling swivels, I attached a sling to it for easier handling while out on strolls. The sling, along with a basic cleaning kit I received complementary from Mustafa at Badruddin (where I purchased it) and it sure is a great good-will gesture.\n \nI like the design of the magazine cut-off compared to the one on the Mp153.\n\nI chose wood stock as it''s quite beautiful in wood, while the same in the fibre/plastic stock looks ugly as hell.\n\nAlong with the gun I got 5 chokes, M, IM, IC, F, and I think the one currently fitted on the barrel is a skeet choke (Cylinder skeet)?? \nThere were 4 stock shims too in the box with chokes,  to adjust stock drop and cast. (not familiar with them though)\nThe magazine capacity is 4+1 originally, but since the gun comes with a mag extension tube - the capacity can be made 7+1.\n\nIt has a 76mm/3" chamber and a 28" barrel. The gun is capable of ''eating & spitting'' lighter skeet loads to 3" magnum rounds with auto adjustments in the gas piston.\n\nThe rubber recoil pad seems quite thin but surely would reduce felt recoil by 15-20%?\n\nI heard I need to clean the gun of lubricants before shooting sessions, and oil metal parts and the firing pin area (after passing cloth with a rod through the barrel). Is this all, or should I do more to maintain it?\n\nAlong with the gun got some skeets, Shaheen #4, #6, SG, and Victory slugs. But haven''t had time to shoot it, maybe within a week.\n\nHere''s some pics... alot of them.\n\nThe box seems attractive\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort001.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWhich aftermarket recoil pad do you suggest?\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort002.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort003.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort004.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort006.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort007.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort008.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort013.jpg[/IMG]\nSaddlers gun case and ctg belt\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort014.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort017.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/hatsanescort019.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nPlease enlighten regarding choke usage, which choke/ctg combination to use on which game (quail, partridge, pigeon, rabbit, duck, goose, boar) at particular ranges.

(449031, ' @Chauhdary\r\n\r\nnice shotgun buddy. I am sure you will enjoy this shotgun for a very long time. now coming to the questions that you have asked:\r\n\r\n1. take the choke out, if its marked Sk, then its skeet. otherwise it could be a cylinder choke if shows CL or no marking on it.\r\n\r\n2. Bro, the choice of aftermarket recoil pad depends upon many factors such as gun fit.  autoloaders usually do not need recoil pads therefore it is not wise to spend money on an expensive accessory, especially if you are not looking to change some important gun characteristic such as length of pull etc.,\r\n\r\nstill if you bent on getting an aftermarket recoil pad then my recommendations would be:\r\n\r\n>>>>stick with the original thickness of the pad if you are comfortable with the length of pull.\r\n\r\n>>>>instead of going for super expensive and high performance recoil pads such as Limbsaver and Kickeez, try to get a pachmyer old english skeet pad. its looker way better than any limbsaver or kickeez pad I have ever seen. its recoil performance may not be up to par with the two big names but since the said gun is an autoloader, you do not need a canon to kill a bird. for your purpose,  pachmyer old english skeet pad works way better than any factory supplied recoil pad.\r\n\r\n3. nopes! not much is required in terms of cleaning. kindly refer to a shotgun cleaning thread for a detailed cleaning one you reach a certain round count.\r\n\r\n4. for quail and partridge use Improved Cylinder (IC), for pigeon use Improved Cylinder or Modified (depends upon shooting conditions such as range), for Duck Improved Cylinder or Modified, for Rabbit use Modified and for Boar use Improved Modified.\r\n\r\nI personally never recommend full choke. I don''t know why but I have always found full choke''s pattern to be less than ideal in most shotguns. in my humble opinion, tighter chokes require a much higher degree of manufacturing quality and most shotgun makers tend to put quality chokes at the lowest priority. now you know why aftermarket choke tube manufacturers thrive in this highly competitive industry.\r\n\r\n5. don''t shoot the gun without a choke tube installed. nothing will happen but you run the risk of damaging fine choke tube threads.\r\n\r\n6. you use a choke wrench. besides, you hardly need to change the choke tube during a hunt. unless you put in a wrong tube for the job in the first place.\r\n\r\n7. you may use any choke tube for buckshots. your range, pattern performance and personal preference will decide which choke to ultimately use.\r\n\r\n8. modern slugs are said to be safe in any degree of choke. however just to be on the extra safe side, its better to use more open chokes such as Cylinder, Skeet, Improved Modified. I have always found that slugs perform better when there is just a slight degree of choke. it kinda promote consistency in the flight path of slug when it leaves the muzzle. I would suggest start with Improved Cylinder. at times, Cylinder/Skeet gives better results. anyways, you''ll have to test them at a range to know for sure.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(449037, ' @Denovo & 12G Thank you for the kind comments. You guys did a great job and we were also fortunate enough to experience infighting between the importers/investors resulting in cancellation of almost all middle men and direct sales by one party to the market. \n\nI would however request that any such future ''molestations'' not be taken out very soon. :) One per year is enough.\n\nThe 1100 round test was more of an attempt to destroy the gun that no owner would willingly do to their weapon. I could never really comment on accuracy as after what I put the gun/barrel though, that gun could not represent Caracal guns as a whole. \n\nWould also request you guys that since Caracal has come down to your desired price range, let''s now drop any preconceptions and judge the gun on merit and with an open mind. Otherwise it sends a really bad signal to the firearms manufacturers/importers/dealers as in the past about 75 % of Caracal discussions were over price and the members who had bought one are having to defend their choice/purchase.\n\nDo you think Caracal (regardless of it''s price) would want purchasers of it''s products to have to defend themselves specially when they went out on a limb to offer us something which is unheard of in Pakistani gun markets ?\n\nI want firearms manufacturers and dealers to keep on offering us weapons to test as it''s great for our forum and a honour for us. We have to be politically correct sometimes, this whole Caracal bit did show off the power of the forum but lost us CZ advertising and CZ products to test whose deal was almost in the finalization stages. CZ guys and the importer saw what we were doing to Caracal pricing and how potent the forum is and suddenly backed out as bottom line the importer likes his margins and the manufacturer would not want forum admin/management dissing products where they are being advertised. \n\nI mentioned to all you guys in our conversation in person about CZ but never really gave details of the deal. Let me give details so you guys can better understand what we lost to gain the 65K Caracal. \n\nCZ offered us Rs. 250,000/year for one medium size CZ banner on our homepage. Access to all new CZ products on first import, discounts and promotions for PakGuns members i.e we would have been able to offer 5 CZ Duty''s for Rs. 60 K, two months later 5 CZ Shadows for 75 K, two months later 5 Tac Sports for 90K etc. Import of cheap ammo (Rs. 35 fixed for Privi/S&B), funds and help to setup a CZ PakGuns range in partnership. \n\nFantastic isn''t it ? :) Anyway, I did try to pursue the guy but he sort of avoided me. I think we''ll put 12G on his case as he can handle and convince him on a more ''sustained'' basis . After Eid when convenient to 12G, will setup a meeting with that guy for both of us here in Lahore and introduce you. I''m sure you can convince him and follow up with him better that I.\n\nIn the end, I understand and congratulate what you guys achieved.

(489463, 'Turkish shotguns???!!! Hello all. First off, I''m really new to this thread business although I''ve been on PG for a while now. Though I mightn''t have been posting very often, my heart is definitely here! \r\n\r\nBut to begin at the beginning! I had a Mossberg 500 and a Winchester pump from my "Bad" days! The pump was to intimidate and I plead guilty to that vice till I saw the light! But I was PRETTTY good with a shotgun, if I may blow my own trumpet and one fine but fateful day, I was revelling in the euphoria of my excellent shooting on the roof of my Gulberg house when I proved to myself that I wasn''t at all as good as I made myself out to be because that euphoria made me lose my concentration and nearly cost me my foot! YES! I nearly ACTUALLY shot myself in the foot!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that day on, I never thought myself worthy enough of handling a shotgun and so put the guns away, only to soon sell them. \r\n\r\nCome about a month ago, I decided on taking a chance and dipping just my toes in the fast and deep current of shotgunning again and bought a low-budget Turkish repeater chambered for 3" shells. I particularly asked for a gun that would take slugs because I enjoying the feeling of powerful recoil, so salesmen Nabeel and Umar at my distant relative Sardar Adil Omar''s Chaudhry Arms in Gulberg passed me a Torn Silah Sanayi TS 870 Commando Magnum with a fibre optic from sight.\r\n\r\nI very promptly informed my avid shikari friend Kochi (as Henry is fondly known) that I was bringing over my new purchase for his approval, or otherwise. Kochi was visibly impressed but somewhat incredulous about the gun, not ever having heard of it. These guys were heavy duty bird-gunners whereas I was quite heavy duty the opposite! However, he decided not to take it apart because he said he might not be familiar with any new technology, if any. \r\n\r\nto cut a long story short short, Kochi and his expert son Ahsan took me shooting off Ferozepur Road near where they live and since I had just 8 cartridges, I turned down their offer to see me shoot the new gun because I wanted their expert opinion on how the gun behaved. Well, they enjoyed shooting it! Not a hitch! The quick double taps left no FTFs more FTEs. \r\n\r\nThat was their experience, I haven''t fired ONE shot from it after that.

I have fired 700 rds thru it without a single malfunction or jam. It doesn''t jam unless you use low quality standard velocity ammo(which is unrealiable even in Standard velocity firing weapons). Use only High velocity ammunition, in my case I use CCI stingers & RWS FMJs, so far no malfunctions, and i have only cleaned the firearm once.

(449420, 'Shotgun chokes details [URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun#Pattern_and_choke[/URL]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]Shot, small and round and delivered without spin, is ballistically inefficient. As the shot leaves the barrel it begins to disperse in the air. The resulting cloud of pellets is known as the shot [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"]pattern[/URL], or [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_shell#Spread"]shotgun shot spread[/URL]. The ideal pattern would be a circle with an even distribution of shot throughout, with a density sufficient to ensure enough pellets will intersect the target to achieve the desired result, such as a kill when hunting or a break when shooting clay targets. In reality the pattern is closer to a [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"]Gaussian[/URL], or normal distribution, with a higher density in the center that tapers off at the edges. Patterns are usually measured by firing at a 30 inch (76 cm) diameter circle on a large sheet of paper placed at varying distances. The hits inside the circle are counted, and compared to the total number of pellets, and the density of the pattern inside the circle is examined. An "ideal" pattern would put nearly 100% of the pellets in the circle and would have no voids—any region where a target silhouette will fit and not cover 3 or more holes is considered a potential problem.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]A constriction in the end of the barrel known as the choke is used to tailor the pattern for different purposes. Chokes may either be formed as part of the barrel at the time of manufacture, by squeezing the end of the bore down over a[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrel"]mandrel[/URL], or by threading the barrel and screwing in an interchangeable choke tube. The choke typically consists of a conical section that smoothly tapers from the bore diameter down to the choke diameter, followed by a cylindrical section of the choke diameter. Briley Manufacturing, a maker of interchangeable shotgun chokes, uses a conical portion about 3 times the bore diameter in length, so the shot is gradually squeezed down with minimal deformation. The cylindrical section is shorter, usually 0.6 to 0.75 inches (15 to 19 mm). The use of interchangeable chokes has made it easy to tune the performance of a given combination of shotgun and shotshell to achieve the desired performance.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]The choke should be tailored to the range and size of the targets. A skeet shooter, shooting at close targets might use 127 micrometres (0.005 inches) of constriction to produce a 76 cm (30 inch) diameter pattern at a distance of 19 m (21 yards). A [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_shooting"]trap[/URL] shooter, shooting at distant targets might use 762 micrometres (0.030 inches) of constriction to produce a 76 cm (30 inch) diameter pattern at 37 m (40 yards). Special chokes for turkey hunting, which requires long range shots at the small head and neck of the bird, can go as high as 1500 micrometres (0.060 inches). The use of too much choke and a small pattern increases the difficulty of hitting the target, the use of too little choke produces large patterns with insufficient pellet density to reliably break targets or kill game. "Cylinder barrels" have no constriction.

Some turkey hunting tubes have constrictions greater than "Super Full", or additional features like porting to reduce recoil, or "straight rifling" that is designed to stop any spin that the shot column might acquire when traveling down the barrel. These tubes are often extended tubes, meaning they project beyond the end of the bore, giving more room for things like a longer conical section. Shot spreaders or diffusion chokes work opposite of normal chokes—they are designed to spread the shot more than a cylinder bore, generating wider patterns for very short range use. A number of recent spreader chokes, such as the Briley "Diffusion" line, actually use rifling in the choke to spin the shot slightly, creating a wider spread. The Briley Diffusion uses a 1 in 36 cm twist, as does the FABARM Lion Paradox shotgun.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(449516, ' [QUOTE=Chauhdary;287238]Hi\n\nI was short on budget, might get the SX3/Maxus/AL391 I actually wanted sometime later now... spent the money I had on the BSA I recently got. \n\nThe rest bit I had saved, I rate this as a good buy. Much much better looking gun than the Baikal Mp153 which initially amused me (but was in short supply in the market). The guns aesthetics are great, and the thinner forearm provides a comfortable grip. Also I like how the gun is so light even in wood stock.\n\nThis is no review, but just my initial impressions. I''m not so familiar with shotgun terms, just enjoy shooting them so pardon me for any mis-quotes. Also the review done by 12GAUGE is far more informative.\n\nThe checkering/engraving is commendable for such a cheap shotgun. Taking advantage of the sling swivels, I attached a sling to it for easier handling while out on strolls. The sling, along with a basic cleaning kit I received complementary from Mustafa at Badruddin (where I purchased it) and it sure is a great good-will gesture.\n\nI like the design of the magazine cut-off compared to the one on the Mp153.\n\nI chose wood stock as it''s quite beautiful in wood, while the same in the fibre/plastic stock looks ugly as hell.\n\nAlong with the gun I got 5 chokes, M, IM, IC, F, and I think the one currently fitted on the barrel is a skeet choke (Cylinder skeet)?? \nThere were 4 stock shims too in the box with chokes, to adjust stock drop and cast. (not familiar with them though)\nThe magazine capacity is 4+1 originally, but since the gun comes with a mag extension tube - the capacity can be made 7+1.\n\nIt has a 76mm/3" chamber and a 28" barrel. The gun is capable of ''eating & spitting'' lighter skeet loads to 3" magnum rounds with auto adjustments in the gas piston.\n\nThe rubber recoil pad seems quite thin but surely would reduce felt recoil by 15-20%?\n\nI heard I need to clean the gun of lubricants before shooting sessions, and oil metal parts and the firing pin area (after passing cloth with a rod through the barrel). Is this all, or should I do more to maintain it?\n\nAlong with the gun got some skeets, Shaheen #4, #6, SG, and Victory slugs. But haven''t had time to shoot it, maybe within a week.\n\nHere''s some pics... alot of them.\n\nThe box seems attractive\n\nWhich aftermarket recoil pad do you suggest?\n\nSaddlers gun case and ctg belt\n\nPlease enlighten regarding choke usage, which choke/ctg combination to use on which game (quail, partridge, pigeon, rabbit, duck, goose, boar) at particular ranges. Skeet choke on skeet, but whats special about it?[/QUOTE]\n\nCongratulations Bro on ur purchase. :)\nHappy & Safe Shooting.', ''),

I''m hoping this improves a bit with use as so far I''ve fired on 20 rounds through it but I''m not that hopeful :( coz I''ve been dry firing for a week and it''s not changed much after quite a few hundred pulls in the DA mode.

Now all those people who have their card MOI all Pak in the pipeline are not sure what they will get. if they get cards from Nadra the card wil have to be given back to nadra for conversion into books.. If they dont get cards but books. They wil have to wait since it wil take a long time before NADRA actualy starts printing book lics..  \r\n\r\nThe same confusion rests with PBs as well. \r\n\r\nWith the added problem that the political uncertainity wil render the actions of this govt. null and void in the next I.e the PB lics of the  govt might be declared illigal by the new one.\r\n\r\nmy email addy is in my profile', ''),

Following examples will help you to understand.\n\nI received my manual license in Oct 09, and was renewed in Dec 09 (Same year) so in your case it is equally OK. BTW, you always enjoy one month grace period as well.\n   \nlicense will be automatically registered with the National Bank Of Pakistan when you will go for its renewal. the Bank cost is Rs 500 per year and you can pay for as much years as you wish.\n\nThana registration is compulsory and not optional as written on the licensee too and this is within the specific time. Just walk into the concerned police station and meet the Head Moharrar personally.  Rest will be taken care of by him. normally no charges. I registered two licenses (One Manual and One Computerized) with my concerned police station and no charges paid\n\nfor DCO registration, er buying the weapon, walk into the DCO office, meet the receptionist, submit your license and it will get registered on a manual journal.  please do register with the DCO as well because when you will go for a computerized copy, DCO verification will be asked by the Home Dept.\n\n Hope this will help you in your case.:smile:', ''),

The MOI (Federal ministry of Interior) had declared all MOI issued  book licences illigal after a certain date and these had to be submitted to NADRA along with relevent documentation to be converted into "legal card licences".. After all the processes had been completed and a number of books were converted into cards.. The Sindh high court declared cards illigal. Soo Now the After the "illigal book licences" were converted into "legal" cards. Now these same cards have been declared "illigal" and have to be converted into "legal" books again that had been declared illigal in the first place but are now legel!!!The task of issuing the computerised books has been delegated to NADRA once again. Supposedly.... Now wehter NADRA has the authority to issue these or eventualy the MOI (Like the sindh home department) will have to issue them is a moot point. right now its in the discussion stage. Now all those people who have their card MOI all Pak in the pipeline are not sure what they will get. if they get cards from Nadra the card wil have to be given back to nadra for conversion into books.. If they dont get cards but books. They wil have to wait since it wil take a long time before NADRA actualy starts printing book lics..  The same confusion rests with PBs as well. With the added problem that the political uncertainity wil render the actions of this govt. null and void in the next I.e the PB lics of the  govt might be declared illigal by the new one.my email addy is in my profile[/QUOTE]Ed Bro, you yourself in intitial post said that Nadra is still making such licences....[QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;287098]Actually NADRA is still making these licences in Sindh.

I.e 9mm... or .30 etc..\r\n\r\nMore ever theere are some excellent .22 revolvers around.. I tend not to go for a pistol with .22 rimfire rounds. Pistols are suseptable to FTFs with differnt loads with different pistols prefering different brands. Thats why I prefer wheel guns for those.. Generaly they go bang every time...\r\n\r\nHowever U might need a revolver lic for that.. So U see. the lic is waaay more important then the gun.. Contrary to what people new to fireems think. 1st getting the right weapon then going afte rthe licence.. its kind of like putting a cart before the horse.. \r\n\r\nIf U decide to get a .22 wheel gun U will need a lic for that. if U go for a 9mm pistol U mught need a differnt lic for that. or alternately u mignt need to change your old one.. \r\n\r\nSo first U have to decide which lic. then we can go about finding the right gun for that particular lic. \r\n\r\nAs a general rule we usually ask a newbie if he has a license before telling him all bout the guns he might be interested in... Because he wont even be able to see the weapon he might decide on, at the dealership. The dealers dont entertain people wihtout lics..

And a 63k SC wiht rails is as good as it gets these days. \r\n\r\nAs regards CF. I consider the CF better then teh cougher in terms of features if not fit & finish. Cause it has a loaded chamber indicator. \r\n\r\nTHe CF is a military fire arm so wil work wel wiht FMJs however it might give problems wiht JHPs.  \r\n\r\nThe CF is Made in China. Its a military fire arm so the fit and finish is strictly functional. CFs do have stiff controllevers. But not all. The cougher''s lever is not exactly soft either.. Ambidextous controls do tend to be stiff.. \r\n\r\nThe Cougher is made in tuerky by soeger a berreta subsidary. in fact the cougher is actualy a berreta.

This is very common in hammer-fired pistols, but not so in striker-fired guns. The Caracal, Glock and the Styer M9 pistols all lack the DA mode, hence no "Second Strike".

It all depends on situation to situation and place to place:\r\n\r\nYour Qs. 1) You will have read in internet sites that mallards and all other ducks you mentioned r attracted to mallard decoys and call of a mallard female ... I think this ain''t true for our situations here. Reason is we have a lot more gunning pressure here than in States coupled with the fact that mostly river hunting takes place here and as mallard is a bird of undisturbed marshes, this King of all ducks has unfortunately become increasingly scarce. ''Undisturbed marshes'' are a rare commodity here. Here it is advised thus to use the same decoys that you generally hunt. But most of times, good qlty pintail and teal decoys (12 each, though teals can be more) alongwith few (like 4 to 6 each) pochard & shoveler decoys are best combo for decoys. Bunch them together or bunch them according to species .. your decision ... but as Liano said, make open zone in bw for ducks to land. Reason: Puddle ducks do not fly over other ducks (decoys too) generally when coming and like to have their space to settle. Patterns of decoys spread is a lengthy debate but generally it is good to bunch one group of decoys along shore on right side of blind and one bunch on left side, with an open space in bw. Use 15 yards minimum distance from blind and maximum 30-35 yards (in general, though NO specifics can be claimed here).\r\n\r\n2) Spead 24-48 decoys (geese shells painted with same color in matte finish) in majority feeding pose and others resting ones with 2-4 sentries .. in same pattern as our geese  generally graze here in wheat fields. Do not follow the Americanized type patterns. If you intend to make two separate bunches, just use two bunches maximum .. one on either side of blind at considerable distance ... not near blind. Geese are wary. Use a distance of 25-40 yards from blind, no more than 40 yards for last decoy. And use a call. Same call as our species. I have four or five of them & they are deadly in pulling the flock at 10 yards distance from guns.. especially the feed chuckle which is a gr8 tool. I use silhouettes too (about 12-18)..try them ..they fill up the spread well. Use a very very dense blind, preferably few feet dug into ground (semi PIT blind).\r\n\r\n3) Answered in no.1 above.\r\n\r\n4) Call them only if you are a master caller and are using good quality duck calls and with the right tone. TONE and volume of call you use are very important. But...if you are not a master caller or an old hand, when birds spot the decoys at say about a 100-200 yards, stop calling and lie still and close to ground as possible with head down and wait for them to come in point blank range (10-25 yards) and then daz dazz dazzz ....\r\n\r\n5) Motion decoys are a delight to shoot with if one uses the right model and with appropriate placement. I have five motion decoys (battery/cell types) now which I experiment with at different times and have seen some patterns with their usage on ducks. The usual mallard male mojo with large metal flashing wings scares ducks off when ducks  are near hide..at least thats what we have seen here. Reason: they are common everywhere since last 1-2 yrs and give off a high flash with less rotation speed. That makes them a duck repelling instrument rather than an attractant. Even if one has them, use a remote to switch ''em off when ducks have spotted the decoys and are coming towards blind. Idea basically is to let them see decoys and spread and make an attractive looking space (from skies) in between the spread. NOTE: they will land AGAINST wind (almost always) when they finally decide to set their wings to land.\r\n\r\nI think that might address your confusion to an extent ... and settle your unease with not getting an answer  to your query ;)', ''),

(449857, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;287947]first and foremost. Do try and get a license. They are not particularly easy to accure thse days.. and sometimes they have the calibre marked on em. I.e 9mm... or .30 etc..\n\nMore ever theere are some excellent .22 revolvers around.. I tend not to go for a pistol with .22 rimfire rounds. Pistols are suseptable to FTFs with differnt loads with different pistols prefering different brands. Thats why I prefer wheel guns for those.. Generaly they go bang every time...\n\nHowever U might need a revolver lic for that.. So U see. the lic is waaay more important then the gun.. Contrary to what people new to fireems think. 1st getting the right weapon then going afte rthe licence.. its kind of like putting a cart before the horse.. \n\nIf U decide to get a .22 wheel gun U will need a lic for that. if U go for a 9mm pistol U mught need a differnt lic for that. or alternately u mignt need to change your old one.. \n\nSo first U have to decide which lic. then we can go about finding the right gun for that particular lic. \n\nAs a general rule we usually ask a newbie if he has a license before telling him all bout the guns he might be interested in... Because he wont even be able to see the weapon he might decide on, at the dealership. The dealers dont entertain people wihtout lics.. ANd until and unless one actualy feels a weapon in his hand the rest is reduntent..\n\n\n\nBtw the cougher was with rails. And a 63k SC wiht rails is as good as it gets these days. \n\nAs regards CF. I consider the CF better then teh cougher in terms of features if not fit & finish. Cause it has a loaded chamber indicator. \n\nTHe CF is a military fire arm so wil work wel wiht FMJs however it might give problems wiht JHPs.  \n\nThe CF is Made in China. Its a military fire arm so the fit and finish is strictly functional. CFs do have stiff controllevers. But not all. The cougher''s lever is not exactly soft either.. Ambidextous controls do tend to be stiff.. \n\nThe Cougher is made in tuerky by soeger a berreta subsidary. in fact the cougher is actualy a berreta. They just handed over production to the turks. and the magazines are still made in Italy. U re getting a berreta. without the berreta name and price tags so to speak.. \n\nU can simply google the images of the 2 and u''ll know what I mean....[/QUOTE]\n\n\nUff.... what hectic laws... separate licence for every caliber.... :?\n\nOK ED Bh, I got it. first I have to apply for the licence. And considering your post I think it is wise to go for the Provincial one.\n\nOK, but about your suggestion regarding revolvers, bro, honestly I feel I dont like revolvers, and prefer pistols, may be due to larger magazine capacity but what ever the reason is, I like pistols more than revolvers.\nAnd I found in this forum Walther P22 (dont know its current price) it is a .22 pistol and hope there will be others pistols in .22 too. \nSo do these also have FTF/FTE issues?\nAs a senior member from ISD, Br Moeen has had also Walther p22 and he said he didn''t have any issues and fired around 3000 rounds or so with it.\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?2758-P22-Walther&highlight=walther+p22[/URL]\n\nBut seriously I am a bit confused in selecting to which caliber should I go for? Because you suggested .22 for me to start and later go to 9mm etc. But also said that pistols in .22 have FTF etc issues...so :confused:\nAnd you also forgot to tell that is .22 good for SD/HD? also what is price difference bw 9mm and .22 ammunition?\nAnd later If I go to 9mm I also had to undergo the procedure of changing caliber on my licence.\nSo, 9mm or .22 still a complicated issue.

(449870, ' [QUOTE=Chauhdary;287238]Hi\n\nI was short on budget, might get the SX3/Maxus/AL391 I actually wanted sometime later now... spent the money I had on the BSA I recently got. \n\nThe rest bit I had saved, I rate this as a good buy. Much much better looking gun than the Baikal Mp153 which initially amused me (but was in short supply in the market). The guns aesthetics are great, and the thinner forearm provides a comfortable grip. Also I like how the gun is so light even in wood stock.\n\nThis is no review, but just my initial impressions. I''m not so familiar with shotgun terms, just enjoy shooting them so pardon me for any mis-quotes. Also the review done by 12GAUGE is far more informative.\n\nThe checkering/engraving is commendable for such a cheap shotgun. Taking advantage of the sling swivels, I attached a sling to it for easier handling while out on strolls. The sling, along with a basic cleaning kit I received complementary from Mustafa at Badruddin (where I purchased it) and it sure is a great good-will gesture.\n \nI like the design of the magazine cut-off compared to the one on the Mp153.\n\nI chose wood stock as it''s quite beautiful in wood, while the same in the fibre/plastic stock looks ugly as hell.\n\nAlong with the gun I got 5 chokes, M, IM, IC, F, and I think the one currently fitted on the barrel is a skeet choke (Cylinder skeet)?? \nThere were 4 stock shims too in the box with chokes,  to adjust stock drop and cast. (not familiar with them though)\nThe magazine capacity is 4+1 originally, but since the gun comes with a mag extension tube - the capacity can be made 7+1.\n\nIt has a 76mm/3" chamber and a 28" barrel. The gun is capable of ''eating & spitting'' lighter skeet loads to 3" magnum rounds with auto adjustments in the gas piston.\n\nThe rubber recoil pad seems quite thin but surely would reduce felt recoil by 15-20%?\n\nI heard I need to clean the gun of lubricants before shooting sessions, and oil metal parts and the firing pin area (after passing cloth with a rod through the barrel). Is this all, or should I do more to maintain it?\n\nAlong with the gun got some skeets, Shaheen #4, #6, SG, and Victory slugs. But haven''t had time to shoot it, maybe within a week.\n\nHere''s some pics... alot of them.\n\nThe box seems attractive\n\n\nPlease enlighten regarding choke usage, which choke/ctg combination to use on which game (quail, partridge, pigeon, rabbit, duck, goose, boar) at particular ranges. Skeet choke on skeet, but whats special about it?[/QUOTE]\n[COLOR=#333333]Congrats bro..[/COLOR]', ''),

The striker looks like the thing that sends the ball in a pinball machine. A spring surrounds the striker, and when you pull back the striker, the spring compresses and stores energy to later strike the primer.\n\nit cleared couple of questions of my mind. 1 more thing i want to ask, all handguns who do not have external hammer are supposed to be considers as stricker fire handgun?\nIf not, please elaborate..', ''),

Though my primary choice was CZ 455 Varmint or American, due to acute shortage of 22lr bolt-action rifles in the market these days, 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] best option according to my preferences was this Savage Mark II.\n \nKnown for its inherited out-of-the-box accuracy & Accu-Trigger mechanism, this rifle has got good reviews by the users except one dislike, the rattling 10 round banana clip. The rifle comes in typical khaki cardboard box.\n \nFor me, there was another added benefit in this version. The polymer stock & over-all matte finish. This stock is literally, waterproof, scratch/dent proof, oil-proof (not just oil-resistant) but at a cost of classy looks of any nicely finished wooden stock.\n \n[B]The rifle was purchased NEW from Orient Traders, Lahore for Rs. 65,000.[/B][B][SIZE=4][/SIZE][/B]\n \nThe official link:\n \n[URL]http://www.savagearms.com/firearms/model/MARKIIF[/URL]\n\n[SIZE=4][COLOR=#0000ff]The rifle is made in Canada though the original manufacturer was from USA as everyone knows.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11814[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=4][COLOR=#0000ff]What we get to see inside the box[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11816[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11810[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=4][COLOR=#0000ff]The lock, trigger adjustment tool, 3M earplugs[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11815[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11817[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11818[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11819[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11820[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11821[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11822[/ATTACH]\n\nContinued ...', ''),

And....what are your reviews about .357 revolver by Taurus above. Gr8 revolver BTW. I have seen one COLT (Python or something).357, similar looking  firearm, with a cousin...it looked and fired gr8.

Love the Urika2, can''t get any better then that. The Cz Duty is Pakigunner bro''s. I sold mine and got Caracal F. I think P01 is a better choice then Duty, because the metal frame Cz''s are better then polymer Cz''s. The Taurus .357 mag is a awesome weapon. The feeling of .357 going off is just fantastic.

(450078, ' May I know the range of serial no. You bought?  Heard that after a79x all issues are resolved. \n\nHave you experienced frame bulging or magazine stuck so far?\n\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=Armughan;269358]There is no need to review CZ Duty after Abbas bhai''s, Anthrax bro''s and TH78 bro''s detailed and expert reviews but just my two inexperienced cents about my new purchase.\n \n[B]The love that materialized [/B]\n \nWhen I was planning to buy my first handgun then CZ or any other such handgun was not even on the list. I was searching for 70K gun and had PT92, Baikal, Stoeger in my mind and my heart with Taurus PT 809. I did window shop the market couple of times and when I was finalizing between Baikal and Stoeger I had the opportunity at one shop to check out CZ Duty. The grip fitted in my hand just perfectly and the slim compact look was awesome. The guy was demanding 110K final so it was just a dream for me at that time. I went for stoeger and started managing my funds to buy it. Finally got the chance to buy it at 85K and I sold my Stoeger for 55k (bought for 58K) and purchased CZ-75 P07 Duty from Peshawar. And this time my love materialized. :)\n \n[B]The impressions without firing[/B]\n \n[B][I] In and out of the Box[/I][/B], It came with two standard magz of 16, some manuals stuff and a CD, a cleaning brush. That’s it.\n \n[B][I]Safety/Decocker[/I][/B] Its with a safety however t there is an option to change the safety with decocker and as per manual its quite easy to do, even user can do it without needing help of gunsmith etc. I am fine with safety bcuz manual "decocking" is not that science and therefore "decocker" is not required badly. Though I do quite fine with manual decocking with my dad''s tees bore and with empty CZ but today when I decocked it manually with a live round, hammer got slipped and hit the firing pin from more than halfcocked position. Didn''t fire the round.\n \n[B][I]Hammer[/I][/B] is not hard. Its easy to cock and decock.  \n \n[B][I]Grip[/I][/B] is awesome. It fits in my hand as if it is made for it. Serrations on the grip make it perfect for sweaty hands. It just doesn''t slip even when hands are raining sweat.\n \n[B][I]Slide[/I][/B] is not polymer and its not black either. Its kinda greyish black. As the slide and barrel is metal that’s why when mag is empty, the gun in hand drops forward bcuz of the weight of barrel and slide. But when mag is loaded with around 10 bullets then its balanced. When the slide is locked back then barrel does not appear to be steady straight. Its kinda tilted upwards from front side. Donno why is that.\n \n[B][I]Magzines[/I][/B] are easy to load. Loading Stoeger''s mag was quite hard. But CZ Duty''s were fine however couldn''t load the 16[SUP]th[/SUP], tried twice on both the magz and then left it for some other time. Mag drops free easily. You guys will be surprised to know that Sig P226''s mag fit in, load the bullet in chamber and extracts it perfectly.\n \n[B][I]Disassembly[/I][/B] takes time, atleast its kinda difficult than Stoeger. It cud have been quite better. Guiding rod is plastic and spring is just pain in ass. It took me half an hour and still cudn''t put it back. I thought I am one big jerk to buy a handgun and can''t assemble it. Opened youtube and found everyone complaining about the spring, relieved tried again and did it on second attempt. I am now scared of disassembling it again just bcuz of that bloody spring.       \n \n[B]Had the opportunity today to visit my frnd''s village for some firing. So here are some range details.[/B]\n \n[B]Ammunition[/B]\n \n1. Chinese Brown box (11)\n2. Chinese Red box (15)\n3. WCC Nato (15)\n4. Armscor JHPs (10)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10541[/ATTACH]\n \nDidn’t have enough time so could only manage to fire 51 rounds. No problem whatsoever. No FTE, no FTF.\n \n[B]Cherry Popping[/B]\n \nThis time I thought not to deflower my handgun thru "flat nosed" ammo (Chinese :p) or "no nose" philpo ammo (Armscor JHP) so the only option left was WCC NATO and Chezh Republic''s beauty''s cherry was popped thru US''s WCC Nato rounds.\n \n[B]Performance at 10 meters[/B]\n \n5 WCC Nato rounds went first. Remained on 7 o clock from target, one was a flyer. There was a smell of burning gun powder after WCC rounds, never happened when i fired chinese rounds with stoeger.\n\n5 Chinese red box next. 3 bull''s-eye. 1 at 8 o clock near bullseye and one again far at 7 o clock. The slide didn’t lock back this time.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10542[/ATTACH]\n \n11 chinese brown box next. 2 were damn in the bullseye, and 3 were smelling the boundary, so I will say 5 were bullseye :p, 4 were at 6 o clock, 1 was at 3 o clock and one was flyer.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10543[/ATTACH]\n \n10 armscor JHPs next. 2 bullseeye, 1 was quite near so lemme say 3 bullseye :p, remaining seven managed to be on the chart, literally everywhere like cricket fielders, long thirdman, short thirdman, back on boundry at midwicket, long on and long off.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10544[/ATTACH]\n \n10 WCC Nato rounds next. Didn’t hit the target. :( one was again flyer :p ... Again that smell ... \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10545[/ATTACH]\n \nSo, 11 out of 41 bullseye, and it was my second time on target shooting with handgun. I am lovin'' it :p\n \nNow time for being a little controversial here :p\n \n[B]CZ Duty VS Caracal[/B]\n \nBeing a new learner and novice, I think I should be using hammer fired handguns to be familiar with guns and stuff. If hammer or no hammer is not a problem and I shud pick one based on internet reviews, I''ll go for CZ Duty with my eyes closed. Personal choice, no offence meant.\n \n[B]CZ Duty VS CZ 999[/B]\n \nWell, that’s an awkward comparison. Charade GTTI or Baleno are cheaper than VTI, could outrun vti oreal, and their consumption is quite better than VTU but still people buy VTI oreal, are they stupid or what or there are few things like brand loyalty, or ego, or lust for having good thing whether not it outperforms its cheaper competitor. Its as simple as you read it. So, if price is not the factor, CZ Duty anytime of the day. No comparison whatsoever. :p\n\nHere are pix of my queen :p\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10546[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]10548[/ATTACH]\n\nDenovo bro, Naved bro, any help for pix ...

(450174, ' [QUOTE=Muhammad Ali Anwer;288110]Can any one tell that is there any purpose behind hunting so many ducks? I mean in my opinion hunting is done for two reasons, although liking is common in both of them, \r\n1. to kill harmful and dangerous beasts, e.g. wild pigs, boars etc\r\n2. to kill harmless animals or birds to enjoy hunting as well as enjoying their meat.\r\n\r\nSo, duck hunting surly does not fall in 1st category, does it fall in 2nd one ? If yes then can Dr Sb or other hunters are able to eat all what they hunt or atleast consume  ??? :D[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Muhammad Ali Anwer;288396]Nice point made Laino!\r\n\r\nBut I would humbly suggest that hunters should focus on hunting beasts, that seems more excited achievement oriented and enjoyment....![/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n@AliAnwer bro, the real thrill in hunting is wingshooting, that too fast darting birds, not "beasts" ;) , or even hoofed animals. Besides, game meat of wild birds is one of the best sources of animal protein with good cholesterol and amino acids...all without synthetic hormones etc etc ... you can ask any nutritionist. Besides that, religiously speaking too, hunting was a sport of some of our Prophets (a member ''Engineer'' br. can throw better light on this topic from religious pt of view). Yet the issue of quantity which was raised....thats not a continuous occurance. It is occassional and infrequent that a handsome quantity of game birds is found, then shot and also retrieved. All these three aspects (found + shot + retrieved) are not easy, therefore occasional hunting of good bags should not be objectionable. Also, the bags, whatever they are, are divided among 4-6 group members most of times including hosts and guides ... so, per head quantity of birds that a gunner takes home is not much. And, yes ...all game is devoured keenly in every home and enjoyed over dinners among family members & close friends. Some game is even given to special friends who had requested for it since season start. So, on face of it though, it might appear obnoxious to you, from a closer perspective, it is not that outrageous or treacherous ;). The "image" of a hunter holding a shotgun and firing at (so-to-say harmless) gamebirds does always appear as objectional to all NON-hunters.\r\n\r\nP.S: These "beasts" such as wild boars, deer etc are also very harmless, rather both run at the first sight of a human. Its only in jungle lore that animals are portrayed as dangerous. In reality, they are not. They are very much afraid of humans. So harmful or harmless, does not apply IMO.', ''),

(450239, 'Review: Churchil Over and Under 12 gauge Shotgun [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nToday I came across a special (different rather) over and under shotgun at the range today which kind of tickled my fancy enough to pick it up and write a review about it.\r\n\r\nThe gun that I am talking about is a Churchil Over and Under Shotgun produced in Turkey or Italy or Turkey or Italy or Turkey or Italy or Turkey or Italy or Turkey or Italy or Turkey or Italy or Turkey or Italy or Turkey. Now I am feeling woozy.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1942.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1949.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe gun comes with 28 inch vented side rib barrels and supplied with 5 choke tubes. The receiver is engraved with a covey of ducks. All that at a price at of 55K.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1943.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1944.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1945.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1947.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nHas anyone noticed the &#8220;Made in Italy&#8221; markings? A little bit of net search revealed that Churchil shotguns were indeed made in Italy for a while before the brand moved to Akkar Silah of Turkey. If this gun is Italian then I guess it must be the lowest of the low for Italian gun industry.', ''),

In all fairness, the engraving looks less like something associated with firearms but looks like something you would see on some really old furniture.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1950.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe aluminum receiver looks reasonably well made with no machining marks on the outside. The bottom plate of the receiver displays laser etched CHURCHIL with a very minimalist approach to aesthetics. The trigger guard is also engraved with a leaf pattern. the receiver is finished in something that looks like semi gloss powder coating.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1952.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe bore and 3 inch magnum chambers are chromed lined for ease of cleaning and corrosion resistance. The safety button (also serves as a selector) and opening lever offer plenty of purchase for easy operation.\r\n\r\nThe action was quiet stiff for a guy who is used to Russian Baikals. I wasn''t really expecting a Turkish shotgun to be this stiff even when new. Not only it was difficult to open, it was equally difficult to close as well.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1954.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe serrated 7mm rib runs true to the bore with no noticeable flaws in manufacturing.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1955.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe recoil pad though soft and easy to shoulder (thanks to the plastic heal) feels too thin for the job. The recoil on this thing was on the high side but not to a level that would tenderize shoulders.', ''),

In my humble opinion, you expect old double trigger side by side double barrel shotguns to sport something like this. It could be more of a personal preference thing than a flaw. The checkering felt laser cut with clean lines offering adequate grip.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1957.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI specially liked the schnabel-like forend. The checkering here is more than adequate offering better grip and handling than what I am used to.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1958.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA look at the upside down over and under shotgun.

The finish is a deep black/blue unlike the ugly black chrome finish on some of the current budget oriented Turkish offerings.\r\n\r\nThe side ribs are vented probably to reduce weight. Cant say much about the weight savings that they might cause but they sure look great. The first thing that you notice after picking the barrel up is how light weight they are. For a moment there I thought I am handling a set of 20 gauge barrels.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1964.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe gold plated trigger offers plenty of surface area for adequate trigger control however it was probably the leading contender in the race of horrible triggers. The trigger pull felt like you are pulling a truck. The break was noway near anything resembling a clean break. There was no pre or post travel but for such a horrible trigger I guess things like these hardly matter.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1966.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe florescent front sight resembled something like a fiberoptic sight. Not my cup of tea given small its size and poor light gathering ability.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1968.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1967.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOverall barrels look quiet impressive. With clean lines and polished deep blue finish. The gun comes with 5 flush fitting chokes that look remarkably similar to Hatsan or most Turkish shotgun chokes. The choke tube&#8217;s build quality was reasonable too.', ''),

It field strips into three major parts, pretty common for over and under shotguns these days.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1970.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe monoblock looks like its adequately machined. I couldn''t spot anything out of the ordinary. The setup ensures that the receiver is reasonably short.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1971.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSeems to offer adequate bite for a reasonably strong lockup. The automatic ejectors are well made too. I could not find a way to turn them into manual extractors. I guess best of luck running after empties if you are into that sort of a thing.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1972.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I was quiet impressed by the overall construction of the forend. The part that takes up stress is made out of stainless steel.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1973.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1974.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe aluminum receiver is super light. The machining is reasonably impressive for a gun that costs 55K. definitely beats the Russian shotty in finish.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1975.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Churchill%20Over%20and%20Under%20Shotgun/IMG_1978.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI was kind of concerned about the wearing out of aluminum specially at the breach area but then I found that the breach face is piece of stainless steel held in its place with the help of a screw. With the wearing out issue settled, I am thinking if parts are ever become available in future, one can get it replaced if this plate ever gets worn out. A plus in my books&#8230;well&#8230;. sort of.\r\n\r\n[B]Final Thoughts:[/B]\r\n\r\nWell, its basically everything you would expect out of an otherwise extremely ordinary double barrel over and under shotgun. However there is one thing that instantly strikes anyone who picks up this shotgun for the first time, that is, its weight. Weighing at slightly less than 6.5lbs, this gun is extremely light and well balanced.\r\n\r\nQuick on the shoulder and lightning fast due its less weight. Sure, the recoil was a little on the higher side but its nothing out of the ordinary for a light weight field double barrel shotgun.\r\n\r\nOver all 50 rounds were fired from it with zero malfunctions of any kind. The gun shouldered superbly and pointed quiet nicely as well. the gun did felt a little whippy but I guess it happens with super light shotguns and the operator is accustomed to shotguns that handle like  2*4s.\r\n\r\nAnyways, as far as durability, finishing and looks are concerned, I am afraid there are probably better options in the market in its price range however if a super light weight and reliable shotgun is your primary requirement, to carry a lot and shoot a little, look no further as this shotgun gladly gets included in the &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221; list.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(450340, ' [QUOTE=francolino;288422]@AliAnwer bro, the real thrill in hunting is wingshooting, that too fast darting birds, not "beasts" ;) , or even hoofed animals. Besides, game meat of wild birds is one of the best sources of animal protein with good cholesterol and amino acids...all without synthetic hormones etc etc ... you can ask any nutritionist. Besides that, religiously speaking too, hunting was a sport of some of our Prophets (a member ''Engineer'' br. can throw better light on this topic from religious pt of view). Yet the issue of quantity which was raised....thats not a continuous occurance. It is occassional and infrequent that a handsome quantity of game birds is found, then shot and also retrieved. All these three aspects (found + shot + retrieved) are not easy, therefore occasional hunting of good bags should not be objectionable. Also, the bags, whatever they are, are divided among 4-6 group members most of times including hosts and guides ... so, per head quantity of birds that a gunner takes home is not much. And, yes ...all game is devoured keenly in every home and enjoyed over dinners among family members & close friends. Some game is even given to special friends who had requested for it since season start. So, on face of it though, it might appear obnoxious to you, from a closer perspective, it is not that outrageous or treacherous ;). The "image" of a hunter holding a shotgun and firing at (so-to-say harmless) gamebirds does always appear as objectional to all NON-hunters.\n\nP.S: These "beasts" such as wild boars, deer etc are also very harmless, rather both run at the first sight of a human. Its only in jungle lore that animals are portrayed as dangerous. In reality, they are not. They are very much afraid of humans. So harmful or harmless, does not apply IMO.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanks, and I think your last sentence seems true, that hunting seems objectionable to non-hunters. But just to clear that my point was not as of Halal or Haram nature of Hunting, I was just surprised by the quantity of the "game". Which you explained. Thanks Br.', ''),

(450393, ' OK Folks!! So finally, we (Ahnab and myself) got the chance to carry out an ameturish range test. This will be my first test of this kind so be kind!!\n\nBasic conditions for the test:\n- Fired at 15m from a seated position using a rifle stand\n- Point of aim kept in the middle of the bull (or tried to anyway)\n- The gun kept as is out of the box (other than the 20 or so rounds fired last weekend)\n- 3 Different ammo brand (POF 1Z, Redbox, SnB 124 gr)\n   - 2 strings of 5 rounds per ammo but it started raining heavily near the end and the Snb target which was shot at the end got completely wet and was lost so the review will be only with the MK1Z and the Chinese Redbox\n- All shot fired in SA mode\n\nI had marked the first and second string on the targets to avoid having to write too much but none of the targets survived the rain. I was initially thinking of marking the first and second strings on the photos using the Photo Editor but again that would defeat the purpose (especially I do not have a photographic memory). So while I will provide a little commentary on the grouping, it will not be as good as having a marked target.\n\nNow for the targets:\n\n[U][B]MK1Z[/B][/U]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11846[/ATTACH]\n\nThe common theme throughout would be that the second string was better than the first. I am not at all used to firing from a seated position let alone using that rifle stand thingamajig. This one was a a bit of a surprise especially the first 5 shots. Basically the 5 shots impacting the lowest on the target are the first string. So that''s a 77 out of 100 with so-so grouping.\n\n\n[U][B]Chinese Redbox[/B][/U]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11848[/ATTACH]\n\nThe Redbox resulted in a lower overall score of 69 but the grouping on the second string is the kind I would like to see on a consistent basis. The 4 snug little holes at 8''o''clock in 7 and 6 plus the on in 7 down  at t''o''clock.\n\nThere I''m happy with the gun now (I''ll get to that in a bit) and, after one more session, it will become my EDC.\n\nNow onto the fun bit. Last week and this week as well, I noticed that the gun is shooting left. So after having done with the range report, I decided to adjust the rear sights as per my normal shooting stance using 3 round strings. I required 2 minor adjustments and the stages are somewhat visible on the target as well :)\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11851[/ATTACH]\nSuffice to say the last few rounds of the day (before the torrential downpour) were all nines. The grouping will improve as I get more used to the trigger (you will note that I have stopped hoping for the trigger to improve and instead focused more on getting used to it). I will also wait for a proper review on the gun by Abbas. Hopefully we should be able to do that next week or whenever he is free.\n\n\n[I]Edit: I noted that the pics aren''t showing. Ahnab will be uploading the pics.[/I]', ''),

I am in  contact with some friends and they also called me up long time ago as  WHY i was NOT posting on the OTHER forum.\nIt is more so a jealousy  kind of a thing. The postings that are HERE are NOT liked by some of the  members over THERE as TGF is over taking by leaps and bounds.\nOne of  the comments that i heard were "The TGF people are arrogant and the  seniors are too proud to answer properly when asked a question even  through PM."\nand "TGF people think of themselves as superior to  others"... i dont know where did they get this.. I have never felt this  on the forum.\n\n[B]\nWasn''t it your Atiq? if I had authority I  would love to kick your stinking @@@ out of the both forums, read how  you whined in the OTHER forum 4 weeks ago, you filthy back biter.[/B]\n\n\n[QUOTE=atiq;278581]@Enigmatic Desires.\nI  had considered my decision by weighing in many things at the same time;  If someone wants to get some nice tips then he should treat the other  person with same respect as he would give to his teacher and if he  doesn''t then it simply shows the lacunae left in his upbringing. I DONT  care about any of them even the least bit, MAINLY because I have a LOT  in my life going on and am MORE than happy with it; In fact i dont ask  Allah to give me anything anymore.. He has given me everything that i  can possibly need.. (read this as 500 chinese and 2000 local brand ammo  FREE of cost every month). HEHHEHE\n\nTrue that there is a better  discussion on some of the things on TGF but what about the support of a  bad egg by almost the whole lot that was present there, except Canik  (member of TGF) NO ONE said anything against such outburst??? IT all  just made everything clear to me in all the confusing things that i was  patiently handling. However I still miss some discussion over there as I  have completed the detailed testing of ammo and wanted to post it  there. All the pros and cons of local ammo is tested and soon i will  take photos and post it here.\n\nBTW: have you thought about all the  other forums?? cauz research has led me to a forum where all the  possible questions are already answered. HOW do you think i got the  sponsorship as mentioned above?? it was in the sponsorship section of a  forum and i did as it was advised. Secondly ... just the presence of  Skeeter sb here more often makes this place well above any other place  that can possibly be.\n\n[B]Anyways i find this forum a lot  better then TGF; and i think that incident was bound to happen and make  me come here and post here only.[/B] I have been practicing a LOT  with the local ammo lately at a private farm house of a friend and many  of the people around me get the same benefit of free shooting casually  if the ammo i am given is in excess to my shooting mood. This all  happened from the ASCC friend''s MEHARBANI. He introduced me to someone  and it all went up hill in full swing.[/QUOTE]\n\n[B]And you SA; dont  you find it pertinent to reveal how many more ID''s than Glock19 you made  on your own forum? you are such a hypocrite and arrogant self acclaimed  superior knowledgeable son of a gun.[/B]\n\nSA wrote:\n[B]I feel it pertinent to repeat my post made in another thread started by[/B] MythBuster.\n\nGlock19 wrote:\nAnother  thing I would like to share is that TGF probably does not enjoy very  good reputation in the areas of Rawalpindi and Lahore. In fact some of  my gun enthusiast friends advised me to stay away from this forum. I am  not sure about the reason for this but I found nothing bad on this forum  rather most of the things are up to my liking.\n\nregards\n\n\nThe  reason is that the ''other'' forum mainly comprises of members from those  two cities and in between and creation of a new forum two years ago was  taken very negatively, which should not have been the case. TGF  continued concentrating on quality rather than large number of members.  The forum pruned it''s inactive members regularly and continues to do so.  TGF management kept ignoring the finger pointing and mud slinging and  continued towards it''s goal. Today, TGF has members actively  contributing from several countries including US, UK, Canada, Czech  Republic, New Zealand, Croatia, Serbia, UAE, Turkey, Philippines, etc.\n\nCity-wise  (from Pakistan''s perspective) we have actively contributing members  from Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi/Islamabad, Skardu, Gilgit, Quetta,  Peshawar, Hyderabad, Nawabshah, RahimyarKhan, Multan, Sanghar, etc.,  which I believe, is a pretty decent representation from east to west,  north to south of the whole country.\n\nHowever, I''d like to  reiterate the point made earlier, i.e., the aim is not to confine  knowledge-sharing to any city or country. TGF DOES NOT HAVE ANY  GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES, nor is it confined to members of any ethnicity,  race, religion or color. \n\nAs for non-contributing members......  we should not feel bad about members who refrain from contributing for  whatever reason. This is the norm on almost all international forums  where you have members in thousands but hardly a few dozen contributing  actively. Similar is the case with TGF, however, here, we regularly  prune inactive accounts after few months. Till now over 4,500 members  joined TGF out of which around 3,500 member accounts got pruned because  of inactivity.\n\n\n\n[B]You all should see your faces in above  mirrors and do some brain storming as  how a reasonable person can  accompany arrogant liars like you.[/B]\n\n  					[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSorry again bro''s but it was getting unbearable and causing increase in blood pressure, so had to do some chitrol to relieve my nerves.', ''),

Churchill. infact, to be honest, I am equally doubtful about this gun''s origins. so lets not get carried away and start calling it a clone or a copy of a shotgun.\r\n\r\nto be honest, the mediocre finishing on this gun clearly suggests that the manufacture is not trying to mimic any famous brand.\r\n\r\nas far as I am concerned, to me, the gun didn''t look anything of Desi or Darra origins. its the choke tubes and micro threads that instantly give it away that its not locally produced.\r\n\r\nsecond: the similarities between this shotgun and other made in Turkey shotguns also hints that there is a high probability that this shotgun was manufactured in Turkey.\r\n\r\nThird: some parts such as Choke tubes are so similar that I wouldn''t be surprised if you can interchange them with other Turkish shotguns.\r\n\r\nTherefore: overall I like the shotgun but only for a light weight field hunter. \r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Mian-50;288783]  I do remember,that POF Skeet range had a luxury of using a STEEL PATTERN plate installed on TWO\r\n  steel poles and grounded in with concrete mortar.It would have been a HIGHLY APPRECIABLE part of\r\n  review to show the SHOTS CONVERGENCE over a pattern plate.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSir, the pattern plate is still there. we still use it from time to time. however the original plan was to show patterns but to shortage of time in Ramadan it was dropped at the last minute. Rest assured, in my next range visit there will be pattern tests of this shotgun.\r\n\r\nas far as chokes are concerned, I found their quality to be at par with the chokes that are provided by most Turkish shotgun manufacturers. so, I am also expecting similar pattern results. however the truth will only be revealed by real testing.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

The finish on most of the 92 fs models here in Pakistan is Bruniton. There might be quite a few of the blued ones, but they are not common. Also, an original Beretta Blued gun can be seen a mile away. About markings, well none of the italian ones I have seen have the markings on the barrel and they all had the serial number cut into the frame. So, it can be marked or cannot be, it can have a printed serial or not. Now the Problem is that the market is flooded with clones, and the only thing that is conclusive is the finish, since clones can be marked in all these places.... or not.... but the bruniton or rare Blue on a Beretta cannot be replicated here. \r\n\r\nThe thing is that Beretta is a pretty old company and the 92fs is one of the most sold handguns in the world. If you refer to the site I linked in one of our earlier conversations, there are many many different models that have been produced, with all these different markings, which is inconclusive to the fact whether the gun under question is fake or original.

You can''t shoot lets say even 50 rounds of .357 in a day. But .45 you can shoot all day long hundreds of rounds. Another advantage of a .45 is that you can use it as a SD gun too.

The next step going back to the home department to get the book printed.\n\nThe verification process took me two weeks and each verification step took approx a day I.e u submit the letter n collect it the coming day.\n\nThe rest of the ordeal will b written as soon as I face it.\n\nI hope this will b helpful to the people who read it.\n\nLastly I need to add that I was plesently surprised by the was I was treated by the ACS. He is the serving home secretary & minister. He met me every time I had a problem. Greeted me with open arms and even helped me fill my form. He also granted my 144 permission and asked me to come back after I had my llicense and weapon so he could fill the details n give me the letter. Without doubt he is the best govt official I have come across.', ''),

I have never enjoyed its shooting with shotguns as chances of injured boars (incl females and youngs) are very high. Of crs the screaming is also very upsetting, appears cruel. With rifle one can pick an animal upto 200 yards at night with a strong spotlight and shoot it clean (dead). Shooting males except the young/juveniles is ok... one should spare the females with young ones tagging along. But I have not heard of any hunter sparing them even which is the worst part.

Stoeger Cougar-8000 or Taurus PT-809\n(at same place because both felt equally good in my hands and PT-809 appears better to me for its slide''s being rectangular like but heard about its ammo-sensitivity issue)\n\n\n2.Zigana-T LEA version\n(though Zigana-T LEA as told by Bro Abbas in his post is priced 90K and my budget is 60K-75K so I might be increasing it after having opinions and reports on relaibilty from senior members if so)\n\n3.Taurus PT-92(least for this because of its large frame size)\n\n\nThankyou all.', ''),

I am posting a screenshot taken just now:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]11927[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]11928[/ATTACH]\n\nIt is the norm for PakGuns to have 13-18 times the users of TGF at anytime. According to their stats however they claim to have almost half our visitors (35,069 vs our 82,643). If we are getting 2600 visitors per day (which is true) these guys should be getting  about 1106 (2600/2.35) visitors per day. Does that make sense ? The reason we have so many visitors at our forum is because it is open for all, i.e no membership is required to read the content here. At Tgf the picture is completely different, what are 1106 users doing there everyday if they are not members and can''t read the content ?? Understandable that maximum maybe they have 106 members online in a day, what are the other 1000 guests doing ? Stareing at a blank Please signup page ?? \n\nAlso note that our member/guest counter is set at 5 seconds ! Which means that when a member leaves the forum our count updates his leave and minuses him from the total online in 5 seconds. Theirs is set at 5 minutes ! that means they are still counting people who have left the forum 5 mins ago in their count. If I set it at 5 mins, lol our server crashes and it gives a "Too many users" error message. If our hosting/server could take it without crashing/slowing down then our 5 minute count would be something over 1500 members online !\n\nAnyway even with these doggy err I mean dodgy ;) stats the interesting thing to note is that their Number 1 city Karachi has more users than Number 2 city to Number 14 city put together, making it a strictly Karachi based forum and we still have about double the readers from Karachi than they do :)', ''),

If you pull DA trigger in one go (rather quickly) then no problem.\n2. But if you pull DA trigger very slowly to see what happens then you have problems.\n\nSolutions:\n1. Dry firing will loose the DA trigger a bit (at least with my case)\n2. Put your index finger on the lower tip of the trigger, in order to get more power.[/QUOTE]', ''),

(451559, 'Self Defence ; Understanding the implications This is a compilation of some interesting Stuff I came across over the internet, and decided to repost All that material here, its a lot of info, some repeated ideas and I would suggest all people that are interested in SD/HD to go over these in their Free time.\n\nQ&A: Fighting with a Handgun\n\nLet&#8217;s discuss some truths about fighting with a handgun. First, answer yes or no to the following questions (for this particular scenario, assume that you have made the decision to use lethal force based on your particular state laws):\n\n1. Do you know how to select and utilize gear that will ensure your survival as opposed to allowing you to lose your gun during a dynamic situation?\n\n2. When dealing with a potential threat more than three yards away, can you access and draw your firearm efficiently and quickly (under two seconds), and do you practice those techniques weekly (at a minimum)?\n\n3. If you were forced to deal with that same threat and they were less than three yards away, do you know what to do in that close proximity?\n\n 4. What if that same threat were so close (less than a yard) that they could grab or punch you? Would you know how to handle that situation, i.e., could you protect yourself against the punch?\n\n5. If you were seated in your vehicle, seat-belted in, would you know how to deal with a threat?\n\n6. During your critical incident, if you drew and shot the threatening person yet they failed to stop, would you know how to handle that or what caused it?\n\n7. If you were injured or one of your hands was occupied during a critical incident, could you still draw, reload, and clear malfunctions in your handgun with one hand?\n\n8. If cover was available, could you use it efficiently and still return fire?\n\n9. During your incident, you might experience some physiological and psychological effects that could easily rattle you. Do you know what to expect?\n\n10. Lastly, have you ever exposed yourself to stress that simulates a real fight, and if not, do you know what it will be like?\n\nMost tests have a minimum passing score of XX, right? This test does not. If you don&#8217;t get 100% &#8220;yes&#8221; on it, you might die. The ten questions all describe critical items that can mean the difference between life and death &#8230; yours, that is. Take the time to find the answers before your critical incident. Unfortunately, most people consider carrying a firearm a convenience that simply makes them feel safer, and fail to address the seriousness of actually carrying a firearm for self-defense. The truth is, if you have made the decision to carry a gun for self-protection, you are a warrior. Now you must begin to train and act like one.\n\nComplete Article :[url]http://www.personaldefensenetwork.com/articles/tactics-defensive-issues/the-concealed-carry-trap/[/url] \n\n\nI was sitting in on a Combat Focus Shooting Instructor Development course in Washington state when my ears perked up. Rob Pincus, the lead instructor and developer of the course, had drawn a couple of rectangles on the whiteboard. One depicted a target with shots evenly distributed within its area, and the other the same number of shots tightly grouped in the center.\n\n&#8220;What can you say about these targets?&#8221; he asked the instructor candidates. &#8220;Good shooting!&#8221; exclaimed one student, the others joining in the ensuing laughter.\n\nRob looked a little puzzled. After all, the goal in defensive shooting is to make the bad guy go away using the least amount of time and energy necessary. Was spending time and energy to achieve smaller groups really a mark of good defensive shooting -- or simply a display of meaningless athletic prowess?\n\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that shooting more precisely than the target needs is good shooting.&#8221;', ''),

(451734, ' This HammerFired gun in not designed by any famous or very experienced person as was the case with CARACAL-F/C but by a young engineer of UAE Mr Al Mutawa :) Best wishes for him.\n\n[COLOR=#0000ff][SIZE=3]Emirati designs, develops high-performance pistol\n\n[B]Nissar Hoath / 25 February 2011[/B]\n\nABU DHABI &#8212; A young Emirati engineer has designed and developed a high-performance pistol for Abu Dhabi&#8217;s leading small arms manufacturer Caracal. The new hammer type pistol was unveiled at the 10th International Defence Exhibition and Conference (IDEX 2011) in the capital.&#8220;It is my first fire-arm design, which will be marketed. I always had the passion to design machineries, particularly vehicles and their engines. This is my hobby,&#8221; said  Mohammed Abdul Aziz Al Mutawa, who is employed at Caracal&#8217;s Research and Development Unit, told [I]Khaleej Times[/I].\nThe young Abu Dhabi engineer, who acquired his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from a US university in 2005, joined Caracal, a Tawazun Holding company, three years ago as a research team member. The 9mm-bullet with 18-round magazine hammer type pistol is named Caracal-H. It is the company&#8217;s first hammer type pistol that adds a new series &#8211; Caracal-H series &#8211; to its profile.\nAl Mutawa explained: &#8220;Now we have the prototype here on display. The actual production for this type of pistol will begin by the end of 2011. I designed this with the combination of both modern and hammer type technologies and features to guarantee safety &#8232;and precision. \n&#8220;A number of key characteristics ensure high-performance from the Caracal H type. Its low profile helps provide greater accuracy and balance through limit muzzle movement, which improves the pistol&#8217;s stability, and makes for faster target acquisition during dynamic shooting.&#8221;  He further added the pistol features a smoothing trigger pull with a precise stop which also enables &#8232;accurate shooting. Tawazun Holding, he added, played a key role by providing all means of support and encouragement to produce a pistol that combines high performance, stability, ease of use and elegance.\nAccording to Caracal, the H type designed and developed by Mutawa is aimed primarily for the &#8232;specialty market.   Caracal COO Salem Al Matroushi commenting on the new design said: &#8220;The Caracal-H type represents another example of Caracal&#8217;s commitment to innovation and focus on the continuous improvement of its range of products to meet the requirements of Caracal customers.&#8221;\nHe also said lots of interests were shown for the product at the exhibition and it will find both local and international markets when produced and available. Al Mutawa said such success could not have been achieved without the unwavering support of the country&#8217;s leadership.\nHe urged young Emiratis to make use of the facilities provided in the country to develop their capabilities and to boost innovation in technology and manufacturing sectors.\n[/SIZE][/COLOR]\nSource KhaleejTimes\n[URL]http://www.khaleejtimes.com/biz/inside.asp?xfile=/data/business/2011/February/business_February427.xml&section=business[/URL]', ''),

THE ONLY EXCEPTION is if you see a government officer such as a police officer who is discharging his duties and IDENTIFIES himself as being a government official then and only then you cannot shoot him. [COLOR=#ff0000][FONT=book antiqua]HOWEVER if he tries to enter your home without giving a search warrant you can shoot him as he is acting against the law. The proper cover of Law is provided here to the HD person[/FONT].[/COLOR]"\n\nSecondly on the road you need to have the paper work completed no matter what you think.. about government officials. MOST important of all is the original license, CNIC and the Section 144 Cr.P.C permit with you, as well as a copy of it in your car as well as a copy at home. It may seem not so important but carrying a weapon when restrictions to carry are imposed becomes a crime even though you have a valid license with you. The carry condition as is mostly said by the police mean NOT on YOUR BODY condition. i.e. inside the car in glove compartment, console or under the seat or inside the door compartment. The gun should always be in a concealed condition because terrorism and the political parties have made it a habit of brandishing heavy licensed weapons leading a fear of insecurity to the masses. Hence this awkward conceal carry is imposed which has NO support from the Legislation and LAW.. the ONLY support it has comes from the notifications under the Home Department only. NO ONE has yet challenged it in court but untill someone does and wins the legal battle till then we do have to follow the notification and carry a gun with 144 permit duly issued by the department.\n\nI am here as an Advocate who has had about 10 years of experience of full fledged lawyer as well as 3 years of experience as junior clerk..

(451970, ' Flinching control requires mental concentration and acceptance. Apart from hearing impact visual focus also matters a lot. Concentrate only on the front site, do not tingle target, rear and front sights together. Prior to play with the trigger  take a long breath, hold the air in your lungs and consider that you are teaching someone instead of learning yourself. This will increase your confidence for the much better control on flinching and better shot. In addition to this fix a target in your room, empty the gun and do lot of dry practice without cocking the gun. Lift the gun, point it on target, play with the trigger and workout your flinching level and control it with your confidence. Do this exercise at least for 15 minutes everyday.

(452134, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;287279]@Chauhdary\n\nnice shotgun buddy. I am sure you will enjoy this shotgun for a very long time. now coming to the questions that you have asked:\n\n1. take the choke out, if its marked Sk, then its skeet. otherwise it could be a cylinder choke if shows CL or no marking on it.\n\n2. Bro, the choice of aftermarket recoil pad depends upon many factors such as gun fit.  autoloaders usually do not need recoil pads therefore it is not wise to spend money on an expensive accessory, especially if you are not looking to change some important gun characteristic such as length of pull etc.,\n\nstill if you bent on getting an aftermarket recoil pad then my recommendations would be:\n\n>>>>stick with the original thickness of the pad if you are comfortable with the length of pull.\n\n>>>>instead of going for super expensive and high performance recoil pads such as Limbsaver and Kickeez, try to get a pachmyer old english skeet pad. its looker way better than any limbsaver or kickeez pad I have ever seen. its recoil performance may not be up to par with the two big names but since the said gun is an autoloader, you do not need a canon to kill a bird. for your purpose,  pachmyer old english skeet pad works way better than any factory supplied recoil pad.\n\n3. nopes! not much is required in terms of cleaning. kindly refer to a shotgun cleaning thread for a detailed cleaning one you reach a certain round count.\n\n4. for quail and partridge use Improved Cylinder (IC), for pigeon use Improved Cylinder or Modified (depends upon shooting conditions such as range), for Duck Improved Cylinder or Modified, for Rabbit use Modified and for Boar use Improved Modified.\n\nI personally never recommend full choke. I don''t know why but I have always found full choke''s pattern to be less than ideal in most shotguns. in my humble opinion, tighter chokes require a much higher degree of manufacturing quality and most shotgun makers tend to put quality chokes at the lowest priority. now you know why aftermarket choke tube manufacturers thrive in this highly competitive industry.\n\n5. don''t shoot the gun without a choke tube installed. nothing will happen but you run the risk of damaging fine choke tube threads.\n\n6. you use a choke wrench. besides, you hardly need to change the choke tube during a hunt. unless you put in a wrong tube for the job in the first place.\n\n7. you may use any choke tube for buckshots. your range, pattern performance and personal preference will decide which choke to ultimately use.\n\n8. modern slugs are said to be safe in any degree of choke. however just to be on the extra safe side, its better to use more open chokes such as Cylinder, Skeet, Improved Modified. I have always found that slugs perform better when there is just a slight degree of choke. it kinda promote consistency in the flight path of slug when it leaves the muzzle. I would suggest start with Improved Cylinder. at times, Cylinder/Skeet gives better results. anyways, you''ll have to test them at a range to know for sure.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nSIR 12 Guauge\nI have two questions \n1) I am unable to open the baikal mp153''s tube''s cover cap   i dont know what its called kindly correct me f im wrong.how it should be opened?\n2) I emptied whole box of shaheen no6 today it fired and ejected every catridge but i felt something was striking the barrel .i got the  sensation on my left arm that was on forearm? is it ok was it bolt or sth else. should i reassemble the gun.?\ncan you please upload a video of assambely of mp153\nRegards,', ''),

(452143, 'Hi, my introduction I am excited to join this forum and get to know you fellow Pakistanis who are interested in shooting and marksmanship. I''m 21 years old, a student in Lahore and I come from a middle-class family. I am not gun crazy or enthusiast, I don''t own any firearm for that matter but I have a lot of interest for marksmanship and recreational shooting.\n\nBeing living in Pakistan, I''ve not heard of anybody who does shooting for entertainment and fun. In our society, firearms are considered only for killing or defence. For a youth like myself, owning a firearm is considered to be what I would call taboo, if I used the right word.\n\nAnyways, I had interest in firearms by playing PC games such as counter strike, call of duty and what not. I was not really interested in shooting until I saw Top Shot on History Channel and I thought it should be a lot fun if I try target and competitive shooting. I''ve only shot a firearm total of 2 times in my life, with a TT33 aka china pistol. However, I am aware of how to use a firearm safely and I am responsible.\n\nHence, I joined this forum to ask you guys about how can I get started in a safe world of shooting sports, preferably handgun or rifle. I am aware that the economic conditions and inflation in our country are getting worse and worse by day and shooting is expensive. Hence, I am thinking that the first firearm that I would purchase will be .22 long rifle handgun, preferably a revolver. I am looking forward to get the Smith & Wesson 317 kit gun but I don''t know if it is available in Lahore or not.\n\nWell, my introduction is getting longer. I would appreciate some tips from experts here about how can I get starting in shooting, financial needs, what process will I have to go through to own a firearm and where I can practice or compete safely in Lahore. What should be my first purchase? etc....\n\nThank you for reading.', ''),

These appear to be very interesting pieces and one would be reluctant to do any more buffing. Have you seen Abbas''s thread on ultrasonic cleaning? It might be worth the trouble to check if that might be a less damaging means of cleaning these revolvers. You would need to take the grips off for that and that might itself cause damage.\n\nAs for ivory, you really need to apply mineral oil to that to maintain its sheen and prevent dryness - which can cause stress lines and eventual structural damage.', ''),

I am aware that the economic conditions and inflation in our country are getting worse and worse by day and shooting is expensive.\n\nWell, my introduction is getting longer. I would appreciate some tips from experts here about how can I get starting in shooting, financial needs, what process will I have to go through to own a firearm and where I can practice or compete safely in Lahore. What should be my first purchase? etc....\n\nThank you for reading.[/QUOTE]\n\nSalams brother and welcome to our forums. You''ve picked the greatest of sports to enter into, the world of firearms is a  hobby which grows on you and stays with you for a lifetime. A lot of friends started this passion in their teens and still pursue it in their 60''s/70''s with the same excitment and zest.\n\nTo answer your questions in point form:\n\n1). Get a Licence made. There are two kinds, provincial and Federal. It will allow you to purchase a semi-auto / bolt / pump action firearm (handgun/shotgun/rifle) from a dealer in almost all sporting calibres. The requirement is your ID card, two pictures and a filled in form. It can be made through a reliable firearms dealer. Processing time varies but anywhere from 1 month to 3 months. Costs range from approx Rs. 13,000 - 19,000.\n\n2). Once your licence is made, you need to select a sporting weapon/catagory. For competitive shooting there are three / four common disciplines in Pakistan. Standard (.22 LR, Single handed shooting at 25 meters), Big Bore (double and single handed shooting of handguns above .32 CAL) double handed is known as Amateur and Single handed professional, targets are set at 25 Meters. Skeet & Trap (Shooting down clay birds (think airborn firni toothi''s) with a shotgun) .22 LR rifle shooting (open sights at 50 Meters) and Air pistol (single handed shooting at 10 Meters) \n\n3). When you have decided which line of shooting to pursue, the third step is to have a place to shoot/practise. For that you need to have a range membership. There are excellent ranges for all disciplines in both Karachi (Karsaz Range) and Islamabad (Gun Club), in Lahore there is LRC which has all of the above except shotgun facilities. Range memberships are stupidly expensive in Karachi and Islamabad but reasonable in Lahore for Rs. 25,000 one time and Rs. 1000 per month.\n\nSince you''re probably studying and on a limited budget I would suggest you start with Air. There is no licence requirement, no hefty ammunition costs and you can even delay the range membership by practising at home. The gun would cost about Rs. 125,000. Walter SSP, Pardini, Walther GSP Expert, Hammerli etc are good options. Ask for suggestions again in the air pistols section if you decide to go this route. At LRC there is a good Air Coach available free of cost, targets are also free and you can refil your pistol air cylinders there as well.', ''),

As PG is a discussion forum, healthy discussion is a good sign here and provides the learning oppertunities for all of us. \nAs per my [B]personal[/B] opinion few submissions (though there are lot more factors in detail discussion):\n1. Eley is one of the best cartridge in the World with consistent quality of its pattern, load, smooth feeding and ejecting and hardly misfires  if used in compatible gun.\n2. Shaheen is also a good cartridge in its price when compared to the prices of imported ammo in the market. However its quality control is very poor in batch to batch production. Ordinance Factory is in-consistent in the quality of shot gun cartridges. Misfires, Feeding and Ejecting issues are normal in some production lots. Imagine the situation of a shooter who attempts a mallard or partridge and the cartridge does not fires.\n3. As fasr as No.4, 6 or 8 is concerned, it depends upon the shooting envoirnment, target, gun choke and personal confidence of the shooter.\n4.

''''Technicality'''' (abt elec caller vs live bird call) is still there though. Limit .. maybe there are revised limits now.\r\n\r\nLIMIT: From unlimited to 30-50 birds per gun should be OK as it is a very small bird and comes here in very large numbers... \r\n\r\nNETTING: Conservation issue would not be there if netting is all-together banned, i.e. no permits (unlike 10K nowadays). Even 10K few netters pay. They thrive on ''collaboration'' & ''coordination'' at local levels by paying 25-33% of this official fee of Rs10000 and then selling the birds in market for profits and filling their freezers.\r\n\r\nCALLER/LURE: Electronic tape or cd or mp3 callers should be allowed as live bird (bulara) is impossible phenomenon, and, thus gun shooting should not pose any threat to bird populations. \r\n\r\nBut...Qs is: Why authorities/depts do not take action in this regard, it is out of comprehension.

The other shotgun i have is tomahawk it also came with three chokes the  bore sizes of it chokes are 18mm, 17.5mm and 17mm  can any one let us know the maximum bore to minimum bore of the chokes[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nWith Baikal MP-153, three (IC,M,F) are supplied usually. Bore size of Baikal MP-153 is Tru Bore i.e. Tru Choke i.e. 0.729" which is standard for almost all English guns too. Beretta mobil has 0.723" bore size and Beretta Optima bore has 0.732" and so on.\r\n\r\nNow, the chokes...........\r\nAny choke tube that you have with MP-153 will be according to following. I am assuming 0.730" bore diamter (ID):\r\n\r\n***** Cyl choke: 0.730" exit dia i.e. 0.000" constriction\r\n**** IC choke: 0.720" exit dia i.e. 0.010" constriction\r\n*** Mod choke: 0.710" exit dia i.e. 0.020" constriction\r\n* Full choke: 0.700" exit dia i.e. 0.030" constriction\r\nXtra Full choke: 0.690" exit dia i.e. 0.040" constriction\r\n\r\nFor Tomahawk, you have to find Bore ID (Internal Diameter) first as per manual or their website, then see the chokes similar way as above. Note: term "bore ID" is used for barrel & "exit diameter" for chokes.\r\n\r\n[Note: 18mm = 0.710" , 17.5mm = 0.690" , 17mm = 0.670" ... approx]\r\n\r\nSo, based on that, 18mm exit dia choke for MP153 is a MODIFIED pattern choke for upto 35-40 yards shooting. And, 17.5mm exit dia choke is Extra Full (XF) pattern choke with ranges of 40-50 yards but of crs for that high powered cartrgs are better alongwith that to reach out to that range. Thats infact a turkey hunting choke and not for our use here. The third choke supplied with MP153 would be IMO the 0.719" (18.25mm approx) exit dia choke which is IC and is best upto 30-35 yards shooting. This would be your decoying duck choke with regular #6 cartrg and for longer ranges, 18mm (Mod) would be the best duck choke with #6 Super Shaheen or better imported cartrgs. My suggestion would be only use #6 for ducks, 31gms for all rounder shooting and 36gms for longer ranges (if required).\r\n\r\n[Pls correct any dimensions or typing errors if I''m wrong]', ''),

(452925, ' [QUOTE=Nazim Sahib;291047]\nWith the CZ 999 you get alot of value for the money you put in,it has a life of 200,000 rounds and has seen action and is also being used by many armies and special forces around the world.\nThe same cannot be said for the other two handguns as the viking is chambered for 9mm (which isnt its actual intended round nonetheless its a reliable weapon) and the Stoeger couger 8000 is only being used by some law enforcement agencies,but is used alot by civilian shooters and is a very good handgun nonetheless.\nThe only problem i see with the CZ 999 is that its a tad bit difficult to use in conceal carry as its a full sized handgun.IF that isnt a issue for you then by all means go for it.\nI hope this helped you out.[/QUOTE]\n\nWith all due respect, I would beg to differ on that, the CZ 999 is a decent gun, and that''s pretty much it. Its way too heavy by modern standards, and after owning and carrying one for 2 years, im pretty much sick of it ( personal opinion, your mileage may vary, also that may lead to my opinion being biased against it).\n\nThe only Army(s) that use it are Serbian , the country of its origin. I hv no idea why the CZ 999 gets pushed so hard on these forums.\nThe CF 98 is cheaper, adopted by the Chinese army ( and did I mention its cheaper) , the MP446 Viking adopted by the Russian military.\nMy Observations are as follows :\nObjective assessment (Cons only, you ll find plenty of pro''s)\n[b]CZ999[/b]\n1. Is pretty much a full frame pistol with a 15 +1 mag ( other full frame pistols generally hold more)\n2.Heavy and THICK(I really don''t like those protruding Slide Stop/ Decocker''s sticking out)  by modern standards ( glock 17 which is the gun used by Most LEA agencies in the world, most armies use Rifles, 2ndry firearms dont really matter )\n3. Can not be concealed in summers ( maybe by some1 taller than 6 feet 1 inches )\n4.Tends to get stuck on clothing while drawing from holster (not as much of late, that''s mainly due to the slide release sticking out with plenty of empty space for it to catch on clothing articles), kind of a subjective issue\n5.Machining marks and sharp edges on the internals, which really put me off.\n6.What''s with the card box packing?(subjective issue)\n7.Subjective issue, the Slide finishing needs a lot of care.\n8. Between its Heaviness/thickness/grip texturing or the lack of it, the gun is pretty ''slippery'' if shots are made in quick succession. \n9.DA and SA pulls were about average, maybe towards the lower end of "average" but certainly not awful or unmanageable.\n[b] Stoeger and VIKING [/b] Both are an equal match with some additional points\nLike ED brother has mentioned. \n\nCommon features : All of these guns will out last the user.\nAll of these guns are equally reliable.\nAll of these guns are as accurate as any normal SD/HD/Combat user might need them to be.\nAll of these are good value for money, (becuz Glock''s are just crazy over the top over- priced) [u]I Bought my CZ999 for 40k two years back and Cougar 8000 for 42k, they shud be sub 55K, however I am unaware of current prices, but I wouldn''t buy ''em if they were more expensive than that.They arn''t really worth more than that to me[/u] I would just get the CF 98 or a Turkish handgun. \nAll of these guns are not easily concealed ( the Cougar 8000 is the easiest)\nI had a hard time Finding good holsters for the CZ999 and Cougar 8000, I think its the same with the Viking ( and a good holster makes a HUGE difference).  \n \n[b]Suggestion[/b] I would definitly re consider the CF-98 if u hvnt already.( cheaper, and will serve you very well, best Budget SD/HD/Carry/Duty handgun out there. )\nAlso check the Piranha Turkish Canik 55 handguns, CZ 75 Clones and JUST AMAZING BEASTLY guns.( some might argue they are best Option, in the current Pak market, hard to produce a counter argument) \nIn the 60-80k Range ( if u can stretch that much) consider the Caracal and the amazing CZ Duty.\nSometimes it comes down to simple stuff as looks etc, so just check them out in person, and which ever gun you feel is right , just go with it :)', ''),

However, the question about barrel life is kinda moot. \nAt 40 rupees a pop,10k rounds equates to 4lac rupees which implies that we''d be spending a million rupees to reach the barrel limit which is a lot of money to spend on a 55K gun. And even if one uses the gun beyond the stated barrel life, the result is a bit of (subjective) degradation in the accuracy.\nI guess it boils down to what your purpose for the gun is. Incidentally, I have been told that in most cases one should actually be more concerned with the frame of the gun holding up to the rigors of shooting that many bullets than the barrel itself.

Period.\nAlso Practice handling your Guns, Don''t ever rely on Manual safeties to Always work at all times. Which Ever gun you Buy , start off by practising Drawing, Holstering, putting the gun away for storage, general carrying as if it were always Loaded , and Always even when you know its empty Treat it as if its loaded i.e Don''t point it at anything that you aren''t willing to destroy, and Never let the trigger finger get to the trigger if you aren''t shooting it.\n\nRegarding the Caracal : For me personally, and a significant no. of people will agree, Its one of the best guns in the Sub 75k market currently.

It does mention that the gun is "Sport and Training" weapon and, this would be pure assumption, it would make sense to have a decent barrel life of 10-15k.\nHowever, it still stands to reason why one should worry about the barrel life of a gun?[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for your responce Ishaq bro. \n\nI''ve seen couple of youtube reviews about different handguns and most of the reviews are also focused on barrel life.

(453084, ' DrNagi68\r\nNice to find P08 lover on board, just for the knowledge sake may I ask what fascinated you to go for Lugger WW-II pistol ? not WW-I.\r\nYou might be knowing but to refresh your memory historical back ground of this pistol is that Germany had the Luger P-08 which fairly served well in great WW-I. However the P-08 was a complicated design and due to intricate cuts and tolerances involved and time consuming factor it was expensive to manufacture. The most important issue is that P-08 has a very fine toggle fitted mechanism which  reportedly got jammed in wet , humid and muddy climate of central Europe ,it hung up for empty brass cases , had lengthy disassembly/ reassembly procedure, but its draw backs were kept secret by the Germans. Due to this in 1940. Fritz Walther by 1931 started working to remove the negative factors of P-08 a pistol having lesser parts. His first success was Walther PP blow back action followed by Walther PPK having lesser parts. Every year lot of research , evaluation went on secretly by the Germans silently with parallel promotion of P-08 the best pistol of the world. Due to same in 1940 June the German Army issued orders to Mauser Obendorf to cease P-08 Luger production & to start manufacturing P-38 which was massively opposed by the Germans soldiers not knowing the drawbacks, so to calm the issue  limited P-08 manufacturing was restarted & it continued till 1942 November after which Mauser started massive production of P-38 only. P-08 of limited production are very rare to find and P-38 are the trophy guns of WW-II which were first produced by Walther then by Mauser and later by SpreeWerke Berlin Spandau.  Due to approved & accepted designs it was given the name of P-38s Walther, To sum up P-08 ( Luger ) is WW-I & P-38 is WW-II gun , i am only attaching P-08 pic , regards', ''),

Period.\nAlso Practice handling your Guns, [B]Don''t ever rely on Manual safeties to Always work at all times[/B]. Which Ever gun you Buy , start off by practising Drawing, Holstering, putting the gun away for storage, general carrying as if it were always Loaded , and Always even when you know its empty Treat it as if its loaded i.e Don''t point it at anything that you aren''t willing to destroy, and Never let the trigger finger get to the trigger if you aren''t shooting it.\n\nSalman bro, can you please elaborate the firing pin safety mechanism in depth.\n\nSecondly, if i am not taking wrong, manual safety doesn''t matter to you. Why is it?? as per my understanding from different threads, experts take it as an edge/advantage for a user to handle a fire arm safely.', ''),

(1) NETTING or (2) SHOTGUNNING - there are only these two methods thru which one can catch/get partridges. Lets assume : the intention is only to EAT via both methods, if you insist. You mean to say for eating, netting is OK, but netting for sale in markets is condemnable??? ..who will be the Judge and the Jury to ascertain whether the caught birds are being taken home for eating or for sale in markets? Yet the government departments of Environment, Wildlife and Forests etc, all categorically mention it (netting) as an illegal act, either for eating purposes or whatever. Besides that, its a lamentable/condemnable act ethically speaking too as already mentioned. How will one confirm before the catch comes in the net, whether the brood of partrgs does not contain females, young birds or chicks, as these birds usually thrive in family groups, most of times young chicks tagging along too. Therefore, government deptts have set rules policy - i.e. ban it totally across the board. Illegal is illegal, whether the objective is eating or sale in markets.\n\nLets move on.....\n\n\n\nMian sb (mian-50), where have you been janab. Long time no communication.

A few weeks (Tuesday 31 July to be precise) back me and Canik and MIG took a trip to Tactical Arms. Its been quite some time sooo Canik and MIG Bros Kindly help me out a bit if I forget a thing or two.\n\n[b]First Impressions:[/b]\n\nThey have a pretty neat interior decorator. Lots of heavily armed guards outside. Excellent air-conditioning. Even more excellent goodies hanging on the walls and peering at us from under the glass tops.\n\nI saw a Vepr 12 MOLOT. Its proberly the best-looking shotgun a mortal has ever laid eyes on.. Compared to the quartet of little Saigas hanging under it she looked like a mother hen sitting her brood (One of the Saigas btw had a drum mag installed )But I digress..\n\nA salesman came up to us and asked us what we wanted. We identified ourselves as forum members and Vepr Lovers (in my case) Ok I didn&#8217;t really identify myself as a vepr lover. While Canik bhai and Mig were doing the things that reviewers do. I was busy ogling the vepr. Anyways back to the topic.\nI asked em to show me the TP 9. The sales man showed me a 2 tone piece. Asking 72k. I kind of lamented the fact that she does not have a safety lever :\n\nMe: Too bad she does not have a safety lever\nSalesman: We have a model that does\nMe: Umm the TP 9 does not come with those\nSalesman: Wait lemme show u one that does (starts rummaging around with boxes an stuff) opens a box goes&#8221; sorry it has been sold and puts back.\nMe: I&#8217;d still like to see it\nSalesman: Ummm\nMe: It did not have one did it?\nSalesman:( Ruefully) No\n\nMeanwhile we spotted a Desert Eagle that bore the legend &#8220;Made in Japan&#8221;&#8230; I had no idea the Japs were doin Deagles or for that matter any handguns since the 2nd world war. There were other Japs. Handguns there as well also manufactured in Tokyo. But we were not able to examine any of those.\n\nMe: May we see the Deagle? And how much does it cost?\n\nCanik: May we see the Deagle? And how much does it cost?\n\nThe salesman suddenly became very very very busy&#8230;\n\nSo Canik decided to take the bull by the horns and asked Mr. Rabbi Motiwala to give us some time if he could.\n\nWhen we introduced ourselves Mr. Motiwala informed us that he really doesn&#8217;t care what the forums write about him? He only cares for the customers in front of him I.e. u people are here ergo u are my customers. Why should I care who writes what. He further state that he only takes Rs. 5000/- per gun as profit. He also told us htat he had fired his previous salesman cause he was rude. And that is indeed his right. Can&#8217;t really argue with a man in his own shop who wants to eke out a living making a meager 5k a gun&#8230;\n\nCanik: Err if u take only Rs. 5000/- as profit, how can u sell local handguns some of which are available at 7 to 8k apiece.\n\nMr. Motiwala: We don&#8217;t deal in local weapons.\n\nWe all tried to avoid looking at the pile of local boxes behind the counter.. (Doubtless they were there to store the Jap. Deagles)\nWe also avoided looking at the double column Local TTs in the display case&#8230; (Proberly part of Mr. Rabbi&#8217;s personal collection.. A very patriotic individual indeed.. Since he sells imported stuff but keeps the locals for himself)\n\n[b]Prices:[/b]\n\nMr. Motiwala explained the concept of &#8220;Tag Prices&#8221; i.e. the price quoted by the salesman and the price at which he will sell. I guess his 5k profit margin applies to the sale price.\n\nThe Vepr 12 MOLOT..( I went up to her&#8230; and like a vision from somewhere up above&#8230; I found her in my arms courtesy the very obliging sales man.. She has some sort of tactical grip equipped with light and laser on her. While I was cuddling and caressing her I remember Canik arguing with Mr. Motiwala.. But the world had kind of blurred and I really don&#8217;t know what they were up to..) Then he quoted the price and I put her away in a hurry. The tag price (TP) 225k. Market tag price is 150k ( By Market price Tag I mean the world outside T.A)\n\nStoeger cougher without rails 68k tag price: market tag price 63k\nCaracal: 78k T.P and market T.P 72k\nCanik TP9: 72k T.P\nCF 98: T.P 44k M.T.P 42k\nGrips for hand guns: The smallest one 1.5 inch approx. (not Hogue) 6k Tag price\n\nUs: Rabbi Bhai your prices are higher. Much higher than the market..\n\nMr. Motiwala: I also run a gold jewelry business for women. Have been doing that for years.. Women bargain a lot. Men don&#8217;t!&#8221;\n\nDamn! All these years I thought I was a feminist.. It turns out I am actually &#8220;feminine&#8221; :S\n\n[b]Licensing:[/b]\n\nTatur1 ( A young member of this forum) had his first license made through their auspices : Tag price of the lic. 22k . Final price 20k .. Delivery in 20 days. Advance 10k. After 2 months he was required to re-submit his docs. He got the license after 2..5 months. Its Home department back dated from last year. Purchase period long since expired and no registration at the national bank. To be fair though Mr. Motiwala took 17k\n\nSince, DC lics are being issued why would he do this is beyond me. We took the license to Lucky star where Ali Muhammad and son&#8217;s manager (Nasir) has been trying to clean it up. We really hope that it actually has entries in the relevant places and is not just a book handed over to us. (Amount spent to date: 4.2k)\n\nMr. Motiwala refers to such licenses as &#8220;purchase ready&#8221;\n\n[b]My feelings:[/b]\n\nThe Vepr 12 MOLOT is an awesome weapon.. And as regards T.A great place to window shop..Especially if U are an avid bird watcher and have a thing for Japanese Desert Eagles\n\n[b]My recommendations:[/b]\n\nAvoid it if u are a newbie and have no knowledge of firearms. Even though it&#8217;s a nice shiny place with nice cool air conditioners and a 5 star type ambiance.\n\nHowever for those of us who know their way around the arms market.. Don&#8217;t worry about the prices, once u let them know that you have done your homework&#8230; They will reduce them.\n (Tatur1 was offered the Cougar or 60k at TA).

The reason that it does not decrease the velocity is todays plastic wads will expand a great deal to seal the bore of the shotgun and not allow gas to escape around the wad. NO gas leak, NO velocity lost! \r\nBack boring means less choke constriction:\r\nAs you open up the bore of a shotgun it takes less choke constriction to still get the same pattern as one with a standard bore.

The current breed of Taurus pistols have a safety lock in place that totally incapacitates the weapon. There is a set of 3 keys provided with the gun. U use the key to ''lock'' the gun. The 809 has this feature. it also has an external safety that can be flicked on and off as and when the shooter want. It helps prevent accidental discharge and the weapon also has a decocker. That decocks the weapon i.e lowers the hammer. The 809 can be carried cocked and locked as well. I.e hammer down and safety on safe mode. I.e U just need to flick off the safety and shoot. It also has a loaded chamber indicator that can be both felt and seen.\r\n\r\nThe weapon comes with 3 different grips for different hand sizes and a magazine loader as well and it also has a rail for tactical laser/light accessories.  \r\n\r\nHowever it is not the most reliable weapon around. Price. around 70k or so\r\n\r\nAnother good option can be the PT 92 series. It also has a ''control lever'' i.e a lever that acts both as decocker and manual safety. Its extremely reliable. and can also be carried cocked and locked. Same price range. However its not an easy gun to conceal carry. Same goes for the 909 as well as 917c. all gun in the same price range with essentially the same features.\r\n\r\nThen lower down u have the stoeger cougar. Slightly smaller then the others. Berreta blood line and Italian magazines. A very reliable handgun with low recoil and a control lever that both decocks as well as acts as manual safety. Around 60 to 63k depending on a model with/without rails.\r\n\r\nStill lower u have the CF 98. Another excellent low budget platform that has a dedicated loaded chamber indicator, external safety/decock lever, low recoil and light weight and a comparatively smaller package then the Taurus-es \r\ncost 40k to 42k NIB (new in box) \r\n\r\nThere are the Caniks as well. however they all follow the CZ formula and have either external safeties or decockers not both in one platform so i will not recommend them.', ''),

This is a big bonus to all that love to shoot trap and other sporting clay games because this puts more pellets into the center mass of the shot string and over all shortens the shot string reducing the time frame from first pellet strike to the last..."\r\n\r\nFrom above, due to reduction of this time frame it looks like more pellets hit a moving target while the barrel is firing and swinging. Other than that, factors 2 & 3 below are there as well:\r\n\r\n1- Over-boring effects on pellet patterns\r\n2- Lengthened choke tube effects\r\n3- Lengthened chamber-to-bore forcing cone effects\r\n\r\nThe 2nd factor is exactly like we use extended choke tubes Vs standard flush tubes in mobil barrels in Beretta or invector choke barrels in Browning. I have found better and uniform patterns (less fliers) with extended types (Briley) on mobil barrel.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd factor is also debatable - but not conclusive yet. The theory does somehow say that there is an optimum length of this forcing cone etc such as 1-1/2"..but the questions still lurk about overall effect of these 3 factors on pattern improvements (if any).', ''),

These had sights on them that were adjustable upto 500 meters :D, which I think was a little too OPTIMISTIC on the manufacturer''s point of view. The effective range parameter is almost the same, ok not as outrageous as the 500meter thing, but still :D\n\nAlso, have you ever seen a maximum effective range statement from manufacturers like Glock, Beretta, Sig and so on?

Remember, a handgun with good ergonomics "encourages" the shooter to place his finger on the trigger; it takes practice and experience to "unlearn" this instinct. The reason I personally advocate a hammer-fired pistol with a thumb safety for a new shooter is because it minimizes the chance of an ND due to an accidental trigger pull. As you said so yourself, [B]"it has it mounted on the trigger, and you can disengage it in one smooth  motion, when you are squeezing the trigger with your index finger.[/B][B]"[/B], it''s incredibly easy for a new shooter to accidentally disengage the safety and pull the trigger./QUOTE]\n\nI disagree with you completely bro.

(453577, ' PARRALAX\n\nI will try to explain in as simple and non technical terms as possible.\nWhen you use a  long range rifle scope it is supposed to be parralax free at a 100 yards.\nWhen we fix a rifle in a stand and see through a rifle scope and aim at a point  at a hundred yards and then move our eye vertically up and down or side ways the relationship of the reticle and point of aim on the target should be a constant and there should be no\nmovement or change.\nHow ever when you move to 300 yds or so and do the same you will discern a small change in the relation ship. ( The rifle must be fixed ) this movement can be as small as an inch or so and could be as large a s a FOOT.\nThis is where the quality of the scope build and lenses and lens coatings come in.\nI want to draw your attention to an important point; a modestly priced scope will not be much poorer in quality if it is UNDER 8 or so Magnification and the objective lense is around 40mm. \nA cheap scope is in any case a disaster waiting to happen.\nA quality scope is also taxed hard, if it is of a higher magnification than let us say 10 \nto overcome Parralex problem.\nBuy as expansive as you reasonably can. ( In optics there are no compromises )\nKeep the Magnification under 10 and objective dia at least 36 mm.( When preparing to buy a scope )\nTry to position your head at same spot along the stock comb and maintain a constant  eye  relation and keep the eye in the center of the  circular vision or the view and the black circle around the eye piece should be centered. This will help.\nThere are scopes where the parrallax can be adjusted but then these are specialist scopes for snipers and I will not like another opening in the scope to leak gas and draw moisture on a moderately priced hunting scope. These bells and whistle are only workable on USD 2000 sniper scopes.\nFor a hunting scope follow Mr Murphy buy the best scope fixed 6 X 42 and you will get a Ziess or a Schmidt & Bender for USD 600 to 800 or a fixed 4 and have a life time trouble free scope. Never ever buy a fixed of more than 6 magnification, preferably 4 X.\nYou want a variable  go for a 2.5 -8 X 36, or 3 - 9  X 40, or a 3.5 -10 X 50 but at least a Leupold Vari X 3. and if you are loaded go for Ziess, Shcmidt & Bender or Swarowski, but remember Keep It Simple Stupid ( KISS ) this is one kiss which will keep you out of trouble.\nProblems start when we go into higher and higher magnification. In optics designs are compromises and I do not want to get into a very technical discussion on Exit Pupil Dia, Relative Brightness and Twilight factor; although in my earlier posts I have explained these and their relationship with a hunting scope. \nM some other time.', ''),

Because I know people who say they shot big boars with LG at 90yds and all but I''ve seen majority of shooters emptying whole mags of SG into boars from 50yds till point blank but still those beasts kicking and breathing. 30yds is the max effective range of SG on boar, maybe 50yds for deer.\nNow what I fail to understand is how can one shoot a bird (goose sized target) at [B]200yds[/B] with a ctg containing just [B]9 pellets[/B] If you''re shooting boars at 50-80yds with DBBL/SBBLs, hardly 2-3 pellets hit the target (or on desired spots)....... wouldn''t the pellets be occupying a GIGANTIC GIGANTIC circumference at 200yds?\n\n(4)What about LG? But the problem with buckshot is at longer ranges you don''t know if a pellet''s even going to hit the target?????\n\n(5)The only slugs available in the market are imported. But I''m totally confused @>1KM range for a slug :confused:\nThe max effective range I''ve heard/seen people shooting slugs in smooth bore shotguns is 60yds or MAX MAX 80yds.\nIf you''re using a rifled barrel, then maybe 150yds with Sabots or MAX MAX MAX 200yds.\nCorrect me if I''m wrong, I''ve heard the drop of a 12ga slug is more than anything after a hundred yards and it doesn''t stay in flight for long afterwards.......... 300yds maybe? 400yd????? 500????? No more. Oh if you shoot in the air then even a .22LR goes well over a mile but I don''t know if a slug''s supposed to do that much even as [B]Slugs are VERY HEAVY and WIDE projectiles going at LOW VELOCITIES mostly.[/B]', ''),

(453741, 'Glock Artillery I was in search of a gun which could give me versatility, adaptability, durability, dependability and accuracy. The gun which could be easily maintained and the availability of the OEM part and aftermarket parts shouldn’t be a problem and the gun which should be friendly to conversions. Glock’s versatility to accommodate different aftermarket barrels, slides and parts makes Glock one of the best pistols in the word. And Glock is also known for the diversity of parts available in the market. And now days the availability of Glock parts in our country is also not a problem but Glock in our country is way over priced while in International Market the price range is between 500 US$ to 600 US$. I think our dealers needs to cut down the profit and bring the Glock price down close to100K max. (at least we wish).\r\n\r\nI haven''t seen any other pistol which has got such versatility (this you will see later in the thread), parts availability and simple functionality. Glock has got reliability, accuracy and all those features that a handgun enthusiast can wish for. The closest I can guess is the Legendary 1911. \r\n\r\nGlock is such a handgun that there has been a vast ocean of information available regarding its Performance, Reliability, Accuracy and Versatility. Rest I will leave the story to the pictures.', ''),

He was also pretty surprised, and couldn''t understand what was wrong. So he replaced it and gave me a new one. This time, I fired five shots outside his shop just to make sure. It was working fine.

Or does it tilt the weight balance twds the muzzle side more...or to the stock side???\r\n\r\nIdeally IMO the weight of the gun needs to be squarely balanced in bw BOTH hands for a good mount & swing movement at fast flushing targets like salt range partridges which are the toughest wingshooting quarries here.

(454155, ' Masroor bro thanks. Good info. I will take your tips on purchasing Peter Engine and the shaft/propeller. Someone told me that the best market to look for these engines is Brandreth Rd market Lhr.\r\n\r\nYes Samad boats are really good and very stable for turbulent waters but.....very costly now. Earlier I bought one for Rs10,500 (5 man model, smallest one) and used it extensively. Later on a friend also bought same and we both used that in exclusive hunting areas with some fabulous duck shooting.\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/19022010003.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBut now it is very costly; the smaller size has been discontinued and the larger one is not practical for duck shooting and phenominally expensive now. Also, trailer needs to be made with it, to transport it to river beds....I then wonder whats the difference bw that and other fiberglass or aluminium models? Latter are much economical and puncture proof of course too. One can dump steel duck stools, mojo rods, sharp objects, decoys, anything in the fiberglass/aluminium ones, but the inflatable types such as Samad or the ones they are copied from (Avon, Quicksilver, Zodiak etc) get puncture after one or two shoots. Then, the rubber has a certain life and makes an expensive purchase less feasible.\r\n\r\nMy votes for any aluminium or fiberglass flat bottom boat having good gear and persons capacity. This is one of my recent flat bottom boats and still in use occassionally as required, depending on water situation.....this picture is before I picked it from the works site and was there for paint touch up instructions to the foreman seen in pic:\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/18022011154-001.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

Today between the 3 of us we shot about a 100 rounds. No malfunctions but then after my 1200 rounds torture test I can say [I][B]"It''s a Caracal, I wasn''t expecting any"[/B][/I] ;)\n\nThe surprsing part was how tight the groups started to get after we had shot 10/15 rounds each. We measured the group I shot at 10M (pictured below) and it was around 1.5 inches. That''s just great and Bilal and Irfan (he shot a 50) were getting the same sub 1.5 to 2 inch groups.

(454218, ' [QUOTE=Khilji;292389]I have seen these sort of birds at sea shore  many time what are those birds called?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThis one is "Common Snipe" and its sound file is below - sound that you''ll recognize well when it takes off noisily. Normally hunters mix word Snipe with "Common Greenshank" or "Common Redshank" which are also common here & have interesting whistling sounds. Common Snipes are the toughest to shoot if walked up and flushed, treading slowly in shallow marshes (feeding grounds) and ideally require a 24" barrel shotgun with an open choke like e.g. IC and 9# 31g cartrg with very fast reflexes to be shot consistently. If a shooter lets it go after the initial flush, the quarry is more likely to be missed...it has to be taken just after the initial flush. If the shooter waits a bit longer to let it get stable in flight (like we do with quails normally), snipes flip left & right very fast as if delibertely trying to dodge the shooter ;). On the contrary, quails have to be taken with a bit more patience as they get stable in flight after the initial spring from ground. Normally hunters miss quail because of this factor i.e.  taking hurried shots immediately after the initial flush. Thus I consider Common Snipes as the toughest wingshooting targets here, but relatively much easier if shot from blind during duck hunting...as they sometimes accidently bump into you approaching towards blind during early mornings on route to their feeding spots. And, their meat is quite good too.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.avibirds.com/html/Snipe.html[/url]', ''),

A tight group easily can be moved towards bulls eye just by compensating point of aim (which I strictly instructed not to) or adjusting sights altogether but you cannot absolutely do anything with a gun inherently throwing shots in 3-4" radius.\nCZ, glock, sig etc handguns (& rifles) come with a fired target (at factory) which always is quite off the POA but they always mention the group size on that paper to describe firearm''s accuracy & we all select the gun which has tighter group irrespective of how far or close that group is from POA.[/QUOTE]\n\nAs far as I can tell, shouldn''t Group sizes be a Reference to the Inherent accuracy of the Handgun Design ( which includes Factors as the kind of Ammo used) and are performed with a Bench-rest of some kind, to minimize shooter interference. And only after that,when the shooter starts shooting standing(without a rest) used a tool to judge [b]how well you shoot[/b] with a said handgun( how closely you can reproduce the same groups) and how Effectively you can use the fundamentals of shooting in conjunction with Grip/stance/breathing/speed etc to effect that.\n  \nThere is a reason why in most shooting sports ( Olympics quite recently) Scores are counted and the groups of shoots can vary considerably, while im pretty sure the target Guns being used can punch all rounds through the same Hole(or very close to it).\n\nSo the question is Why do we consider group sizes in inches and argue over 2" groups compared to 5" groups when Most of the Handguns available for purchase ( correction : ALL of them ) will be More accurate than 80-90 percent of the Shooters shooting them. \nPeople reading reviews then use these Group sizes and information in that regard to buy guns, and end up choosing guns which might be a stretch for their budget, when they cud hv easily gotten a good SD/HD weapon for much cheaper that would hv served them Equally.\nor am I completely wrong in those assumptions?\nRegards.', ''),

Last night I was about to edit my main post and replace the word ''proper'' accuracy testing to ''shooter'' accuracy testing but did not. Completely agreed on in 99 % of the cases the gun is more accurate than the shooter.\n \nAn authentic accuracy test is done by placing a gun in a pistol rest (taking the human factor out completely) and then shooting. This is the proper way to test a gun''s accuracy. That said with all the targets posted on PakGuns we hope to achieve something a little different and practical than .25 inch group to the left or right. What we want to see is how the gun performs in the hands of established shooters firing just a few rounds from it. If all of them are shooting groups with it consistently then that means it''s an easy gun to shoot and be on target for new shooters. If we''re all having issues shooting it then almost 100 % new shooters will as well.\n\nOn our forums we try to be as less academic as possible and as practical as possible.

I.e His weapon is pointing at U. then DONT do anything foolish.. Period!..\r\n\r\nMy advice: next time a BG asks for your stuff hand em over.. Nothing unmacho bout it. I know a number of people who carry firearms and have done the same. \r\n\r\nHowever If you stil insist on carrying a non lethel weapon. Then the pepper spray can enable you to engage without making actual contact.. and the spray will instantly blind and disorient a man for at least an hour... \r\n\r\nU can get em at Tactical arms bahadurabad..
