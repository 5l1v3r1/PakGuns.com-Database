That is because some people gives excuse of having guns as "safety" and "hunting" but in fact the main purpose is either revenge or crime. \n\nIt is become stereotypical sign in Pakistan that a person carrying gun is bad a$$ and must be involve in crime, the one way or other.\n\nThat''s where PakGuns.com comes in the scene. We need to make ourselves distinctive from these criminals. We need to tell the world (in Pakistan and outside Pakistan) that like all other countries, in Pakistan too, there are sensible people who knows the value of gun and own it only for safety and/or use it for recreational purposes. That can only be done by marking a clear line between us and criminal use of guns. \n\nWe need to voice ourselves that not everybody who owns gun is a criminal.

There is a lot of misinformation out there. Please write your suggestions to include in the booklet/pamphlet. [/b]\n\n[b]Currently I am thinking along these lines. This is a sample of the kind of text that I want to include, it''s from the FAQ in the articles section. Please feel free to add information. [/b]\n\n\nQ). What are the different types of Guns ? What kind can a Pakistani Citizen keep ?\n\nA). There are 5 major types of guns. Pistols, Revolvers, Shotguns, Rifles & Machine Guns.\n\nIn Pakistan all pistols and revolvers, shotguns and .22 rifles are allowed. Automatic weapons are prohibited to the general public unless a special license is granted.\n\n\nQ). Aren''t Guns Dangerous ?\n\nA). Guns are NOT DANGEROUS ! While they should be treated with respect they should not be feared. Gun related deaths are outnumbered by automobile related deaths by a ratio of 10 to 1 specially in Pakistan. In modern times firearms have reached an excellent safety level. Usually there are at least two safeties on every weapon and if treated with diligence the chances of an accident are extremely slim. Gun owners with small children in the house should never keep their firearms chambered and preferably keep the weapon and ammunition in separate locked places.\n\n\nQ).  Why are weapons so loud ? Do all weapons make the same amount of noise ?\n\nA). When a gun is fired, the gunpowder inside the bullet essentially explodes which in turn propels the bullet forward though the barrel. That exploding gunpowder makes most of the noise. Generally the larger the bullet/cartridge, the more the gunpowder it has hence the louder the sound. The weapon itself also plays a factor and the speed of the bullet breaking the sound barrier is the cause of the loud ''crack'' sound. The sound can be muffled in small arms by attaching a silencer at the end of the barrel. If you''re shooting for sport, use ear protection. It will save you from going deaf in the long run.  \n\n\nQ). Do I need really need a weapon ? What kind ?\n\nA). In my opinion every household should have at least two weapons. A handgun (Pistol/Revolver) and a Shotgun. Both are multipurpose, can be used for self defense as well as sport. \n\n\nQ). Can I carry my gun around with me ? Is it legal ?\n\nA). It is subject to debate as it is a bit of a grey area but generally the answer is No. You should not carry your gun on your person unless there is a real threat to your security. Carrying firearms to show off, feel important or to appear macho is just plain idiotic and childish. You are a responsible adult that is why you were issued a firearms license, carrying without need is asking for trouble. \n\n\nThe 10 rules for firearm safety\n \n\nHunting and target shooting are among the safest of all sports. Part of the reason is that young and new shooters are introduced properly by responsible adults. The following 10 rules for firearm safety are passed along from shooter to shooter and keep us all safe in the field.\n\n\n1. Always keep the muzzle pointed In a safe direction and Never point the muzzle at anything you are not willing to destroy.\n2. Firearms should be unloaded when not actually in use but be always treated as loaded.\n3. Don`t rely on your gun`s "Safety".\n4. Never shoot at a hard surface, or at water -- your shot may glance off, ricochet and injure someone.\n5. Use correct ammunition.\n6. If your gun fails to fire when the trigger is pulled, handle with care!\n7. Always wear eye and ear protection when shooting.\n8. Never joke around or engage in horseplay while handling or using firearms\n9. Don`t alter or modify your gun, and service your guns regularly.\n10. In the event of a misfire, keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction, remove your finger from the trigger, wait ten seconds, take the magazine out and eject the cartridge.', 0, 1, '117.102.5.174', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 337, 5159),

No new applications for arms licenses would be received and entertained before March 1, sources in Interior Ministry said here on Monday.\n\nThe section dealing with issuance of arms licenses is running short of staff, besides an unusual increase in the demand for arms licenses and this forced the ministry to stop entertaining new applications, sources told Business Recorder.\n\nThe ministry has got strict orders from its chief (Advisor on Interior) regarding disposing of the pending applications, they said, adding that following the directives from Advisor on Interior, the Ministry has stopped entertaining new applications and people are asked to approach after March 1.\n\nWhen asked about earlier announcement of February 15, they said that the ministry had stopped entertaining application for new arms license till February 15 but the date has now been extended owing to backlog. During the last two years the ministry has issued about 178,754 arms licenses of non-prohibited bore (NPB) out of which 2,788 arms licenses, were issued by the present government.\n\nMeanwhile, they said that the Advisor to the Prime Minister on Interior, Rehman Malik, has directed the ministry to issue a new arms licenses only after due verification of the applicant from Nadra and other relevant organisations.\n\nHowever, Advisor on Interior has directed the concerned department to ensure the verification before issuing license, as many complaints had been received that the arms licenses were being issued to the influential people without proper verification, the sources said.\n\nThey said that the arms licenses are being issued on the recommendations of parliamentarians and there is no quota restriction in this regard and Ministry of Interior is issuing authority of the arms licenses. The sources added that the ministry had already stopped issuing computerised arms licenses and new licenses were issued manually.\n\n[url]http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?id=891351&currPageNo=2&query=&search=&term=&supDate=[/url]', 0, 1, '202.70.149.57', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 274, 5700),

For a semi automatic the only option is .22. As such, any bolt action is legal on a NPB. Sometimes, your relationship with a dealer will play a part. As long as the license is not suspect, credentials of the buyer are ok then there should be no issue.\n\n- For NPB licenses issued before 1989, you can own any NPB  caliber in either semi automatic or bolt action. (This obviously excludes service calibers such as 5.56 or 7.62). Infact, even if the license is a duplicate of one issued before the ''Only 22 semi auto condition'' the Home Ministry is bound to honor the original issue date of the license. Case in point is my own license where though the book says in print that only a .22 semi auto is allowed the home ministry made a notation that since license is a duplicate of a pre-1989 license a 222 or 223 can be bought and possessed by the licensee.\n\nThe condition of only a 22 semi auto was introduced later on when proliferation of semi auto rifles and licenses was extensive.\n\nI would advise members that if they ortheir parents have an old license (before 1989) then they value it and keep it safe. Also, in many cases these old licenses (esp for our grand parents or parents generations) will have .22 bolt actions on them. Its better to transfer those rifles to new licenses and keep the older one either free or for use for semi auto rifles.\n\nHope this helps clarify some questions.', 0, 1, '117.102.83.122', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 61, 5823),

My advice is relevant for amatuers only who should not have one in the chamber-either when driving or in a social environment. Also, increasingly I am seeing hand guns in thehands of totally inexperienced boys. I myself have seen boys who had never held a firearm in their life and who''s families have no experience with weapons, simply geting into their SUV''s outside their home shouting at each other to take their pistols out and load cos its late. (eithr to impress their friends or to put their weapons to some use---cos for as far as i could see there was no threat--clearly lit street, no car for 300 yards etc.). Also, i am not a supporter of arms licenses getting into hands of people who are juts willing to pay 18-20 k to dealers liek DAAD and getting their hands on pistols without any prior training, parental supervision or even for the need of a weapon. I for one would not like to e in a mile of a bunch of folks like that. \n\n\nObviously, I guess for someone with extensive experience with weapons and having one in the chamber will be a personal choice and  (like Firepower...) and with them i''d still feel safe if i knew they were carrying a live weapon. Similar to the officer who had one in the chamber and that''s ok. My personal opinion on taht situation was that to have one in the chamber was the right decision...there was a clear and present threat. I myself on occassion have had one in the chamber but only cos the situation demanded it.\n\nForums like this should actually help inculcate safe firearm practices esp for new comers.\n\nI like the comment that "PakGuns officially recommends NOT to carry your firearm chambered"\n\nAlso, my two bits on Army personnel not having a live one in the chamber: Yes a regular infantry soldier will not even cary a secondary weapon..his primary would be his rifle and that too not live. A soldier on protection duty will have a secondary firearm as on perimeter duty he would be carrying a rifle. The close quarter protection detail will have a Handgun keeping both hands free for reaction and crowd control. (they might choose to have one in teh chamber dependent on the briefing for the day and tehir perception of the threat)\n\nDidn''t mean to offend anyone with their choice of having one in the chamber--as long as the decision is based on the correct threat perception, ability to handle the situation, training etc. And by the looks of it members like FP, Balazona and others are mature enough to decide when to have one live and when not!\n\nGood discussion people....', 0, 1, '134.144.244.5', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 328, 5960),

However the problem is control. How do we achieve that at? There is already so much red tape and bribes in place that any more regulation will only mean more bribe that is all. \n\nUnless we get highly paid branch of officers who run proper training schools whose passing certificate becomes a pre-requisite for license I dont see how we train and control them.\n\nAnother problem is lack of training schools and firing ranges.

I ticks me off just seeing that...needless to say what it does to those who used to play there. Any guess what those Madrasa kids are thinking now and DOING instead?

In my view the decision to carry a gun in condition one should be made based on the nature, extent, and perception of threat. However, these days the ''nature'' of the threat has changed significantly. For instance, many a times the kidnappers or robbers actually storm the house of the victim i.e. 10/15 highly trained people with loaded assault rifles and a clear intent to take lives in case of any minute threat to their own safety. Since these events are happening with a much higher frequency, therefore the ''perception'' of threat has changed as well. Now how can a commoner with just a little bit of handgun training can coupe with this situation? May be the answer lies in the readiness. Moreover, it''s not just the question of carrying a loaded gun; one should also have training in quick draw, target acquisition under severe stress, and physical maneuvering. \n\nPolice and/or army personnel in their own country are not trained from a victim''s point of view, at least it was not the case until recently in Pakistan. Moreover the breach of security parameter gives them a significant warning. Hence I would not take any references to their practices of carrying a loaded or otherwise gun.\n\nNow if I were to express my personal view here, I would always attempt a counter attack instead of capitulation. It is still better than getting kidnapped and going through the hell later. Given this inbred, firm decision, I would always carry a round in the chamber, with safety on.\n\nAs far the rich-kids are concerned, their behavior is a by-product of the action movies and improper parental control.

(5441, 304, 0, 'Salman', 26, '', 1235479664, 'Choosing your ammo is as important as choosing your weapon. Choose wisely, these descriptions should help.\n\nThe following basic ammo types are listed in order of armor penetration, best to worst.\n\nArmor Piercing - A hard bullet made from steel or tungsten alloys in a pointed shape typically covered by a thin layer of lead and/or a copper/brass jacket. The lead and jacket are intended to prevent barrel wear from the hard core materials. For game play purposes, AP is slightly worse on unarmored targets than FMJ. This is to indicate the hard AP projectiles'' tendency not to deform or reliably tumble/yaw.\n\nFMJ - Full Metal Jacket - Made with a lead core surrounded by a full covering of brass, copper, or mild steel. These have very little deformation or expansion, but will occasionally yaw/tumble. FMJ is a good choice when you don''t know what you will be fighting or possibly if you will be going up against a mix of armor types.\n\nJSP - Jacketed Soft Point - In the late 1800s, the Indian Army arsenal at Dum Dum, near Calcutta, developed a variation of the FMJ design where the jacket did not cover the nose of the bullet. The soft lead nose was found to still expand in flesh while the remaining jacket still prevented lead fouling in the barrel. For game play purposes, JSP is roughly splitting the difference between FMJ and JHP. It gives more penetration than JHP but has more stopping power than the FMJ.\n\nJHP - Jacketed Hollow Point - Soon after the invention of the JSP, Woolwich Arsenal in Great Britain experimented with this design even further by forming a hole or cavity in the nose of the bullet while keeping most of the exterior profile intact. These bullets could theoretically deform even faster and expand to a larger diameter than the JSP. Best used against unarmored targets only, the JHP also has the least over penetration so it is ideal for use around hostages.\n\nGlaser Safety Slug - The Glaser Safety Slug dates back to the early ''70s. The inventor Col. Jack Cannon named it for his friend Armin Glaser. Over the years, the projectiles have evolved from crude, hand-produced examples to mass-production; however, the basic concept has remained the same: copper jackets filled with bird shot and cover by a crimped polymer end cap. Upon impact with flesh, the projectile fragments, with the birdshot spreading like a minature shotgun pattern.\n\nThe standard ''Blue'' Glaser uses a rather fine birdshot which only gives 5 to 6" of penetration in flesh. The ''Silver'' Glaser adds another 1 to 2" of penetration with the use of slightly larger birdshot. Due to the much reduced penetration in flesh, some have theorized that the Glaser would be ideal where over-penetration of a projectile could be hazardous to bystanders. For instance, the Glaser may be stopped by a muscular or upraised arm. However, for the same reasons, the Glaser’s terminal performance can vary dramaticly, producing impressive successes and equally spectacular failures depending on the angle at which the target is struck.\n\nGlancing hits on hard surfaces will result in fragmentation, reducing the risk of ricochets. However, the Glaser can penetrate barriers such as drywall, plywood, and thin sheet metal if struck directly. The Blue and Silver Glaser handgun loads are worthless against body armor, penetrating only 5 layers of Kevlar.\n\nTraining Ammo - The training ammo is portrayed as a cross between the FX paint cartridges like Simunitions and long range simulators like the laser-based MILES. It is intended more for clan practice, and is not suitable for single player usage. It can cause wounds, however.\n\nThe Hague Accords - The Hague Accords ban the use of expanding projectiles against the military forces of other nations. Some countries accept this as a blanket ban against the use of expanding projectiles against anyone, while the U.S. feels free to use JSP and HP against terrorists and criminals. (The U.S. didn''t sign the complete Hague Accords in any case, but still follows its guidelines in military conflicts.)\n\n12 gauge/70mm Shotgun ammo\n\nThe trick with the buckshot is that you can have a few large pellets or a bunch of smaller pellets. The smaller pellets have a better chance of scoring a hit due to the sheer number of pellets, but the severity of the wound won''t be as great as a hit from a larger pellet. The same principle applies to the armor piercing QB-8 (Quadrangle Buck) and flechettes. For purposes of game play, the armor piercing shot will not be as effective as standard buckshot against non-armored targets. (Of course, the standard buckshot is worthless against armored targets except for taking out the legs and arms, hoping for enough wounds to cause incapacitation.) They are listed from largest to smallest, separating the list into non-armor piercing and armor piercing types. The capacities are based on a 70mm length hull.\n\n000 Buck - 8 lead pellets (0.36")\n00 Buck - 9 lead pellets (0.33")\n0 Buck  - 12 lead pellets (0.32")\n1 Buck - 16 lead pellets (0.30")\n4 Buck - 27 lead pellets (0.24")\n\n\n\nQB 8 - 8 pellets (Armor Piercing) - Quadrangle Buck is made from a steel cylinder cut into two layers of four pie-shaped pieces per layer. The numerous sharp edges gives excellent penetration; however, the light weight and poor ballistic shape limits its effective range.\n\nFlechettes - 32 flechettes (Armor Piercing) - Flechettes are essentially small steel nails with tiny fins swaged into the rear.\n\nSlug - Slugs will pretty well flatten any target, armored or not; however, the issue of over penetration will determine whether you want to take the solid or the hollow-point slug.\n\nSlug HP - Hollow-point slugs. Less penetration than regular slugs.\n\nBaton - Rubber batons. Used for training.\n\n\nCalibers\n\n.30 US Carbine - In 1940, the US Army''s Ordnance Department approached Winchester with a light rifle concept. This was to bridge the difference between the .45 ACP and the .30-06. For the cartridge, Winchester recommended a rimless version of their .32 Winchester Self-Loading sized down for .308" projectiles. The resulting cartridge tossed a 110gr projectile at nearly 2000fps from a carbine-length barrel. While derided for lacking stopping power in contrast to the .30-06, the .30 Carbine is more powerful than many common handgun cartridges of similar size such as the .357 Magnum.\n\n.300 Whisper subsonic - Made by necking-up the .221 Remington Fireball case to .308" and using a 240gr Sierra MatchKing, this cartridge will fit and feed from 5.56x45mm NATO magazines. The Whisper is subsonic with about as much power and weight as .45 ACP, but in a thinner bullet which dramatically increases armor penetration. Good against all targets, but is\nunreliable against heavy armor.\n\n.300 Winchester Magnum - A long range sniping round, it is favored by US Navy SEALS and the German Bundeswehr. While not in the same class as the .338 Lapua, it has roughly the same power as 7mm Remington Magnum, and easily exceeds the performance of 7.62x51mm NATO. Good against all targets.\n\n.338 Lapua Magnum - Originally designed as a long range sniping cartridge to bridge the ballistic gap between the .300 Winchester Magnum and the .50 BMG. It is in service with GSG9, the British SAS, British Army, Royal Marines, and the Dutch military. An early prototype of the cartridge even saw service with the US Navy SEALs. Good against all targets.\n\n.338 Whisper subsonic - Made by necking-up the 7mm Remington BenchRest case to .338" and using a 300gr Sierra Match King, this cartridge will fit and feed from 7.62x51mm NATO magazines. Good against all targets, but is unreliable against heavy armor.\n\n.357 Magnum - Using a lengthened and strengthened version of the .38 Special case, the .357 Magnum was rapidly accepted by hunters and law enforcement. At the time of its introduction, it was claimed to easily pierce the body panels of automobiles and crack engine blocks. While it has less power than .44 Magnum, it compares favorably to the 10x25mm Norma and .45 ACP, but with better armor penetration. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.357 SIG - Designed to produce .357 Magnum revolver ballistics in a self-loading pistol (automatics), the .357 SIG is roughly a .40 S&W case necked down to .355". Despite the manufacturer''s claims, it is not quite as powerful as an actual .357 Magnum, but it exceeds the 9x19mm NATO and falls roughly in-between the .40 S&W and 10x25mm in power. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.376 Steyr - Roughly a shortened 9.3x64mm Brenneke case necked up for .375" projectiles. The cartridge is loaded to give performance approaching that of the .375 Holland & Holland. More power than required for two-legged predators, even those with armored hides. Good against all targets.\n\n.40 S&W - Roughly a shorter cased version of the 10x25mm Norma, this round is a step up in power from the 9x19mm NATO in similar sized handguns. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.40 S&W subsonic - Roughly a shorter cased version of the 10x25mm Norma, this round loses about 20% of it''s energy when subsonic. This round is a step up in power from the 9x19mm subsonic, and has beaten out the parent 10x25mm subsonic in popularity. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.44 Magnum - A high powered pistol cartridge designed primarily for hunting, the .44 Magnum offers less power than .50 AE and .454 Casull, but much more than .357 Magnum. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.440 CorBon Magnum - The .440 CorBon Magnum is derived by necking down a .50 Action Express case down to accept the same .429" projectiles used in .44 Magnum cartridges. The 240gr .429" projectile has equal sectional density to the 325gr .500" of the .50 AE. However, with equal powder charges, the .440 CorBon can launch the 240gr projectile much faster than the 325gr projectile from the .50 AE. This equals greater energy and penetration against hard and soft targets.\n\n\n\n\n.45 ACP +P - The standard U.S. pistol round for about a century, the .45 ACP offers more power than .40 S&W but less than a full-power 10x25mm Norma. The +P designation indicates that the cartridge is loaded to higher pressures and generates higher velocity than normal version of the round. Very effective against unarmored targets while reducing the specter of over-penetration.\n\n.45 ACP subsonic - The standard U.S. pistol round for about a century. Typical .45 ACP loads are already subsonic, making them ideal for suppressed weapons. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.454 Casull - A very high powered pistol cartridge designed for taking the largest game animals, the .454 offers more power than .44 Magnum and has superior penetration over the .50 AE. It is the most powerful handgun cartridge in NATO 3. Good against armored targets.\n\n.45-70 Government - Adopted by the US Army in 1873 as their standard service rifle cartridge, the .45-70 Government refuses to fade away. Most commercial loadings of the cartridge are constrained by the possibility that someone may attempt to fire a modern loading in one of the 1873-vintage rifles. However, current production rifles from Marlin, Ruger, and Browning can accept pressures nearly twice as high as the original black powder specs. The low velocity of typical .45-70 loads does not lend itself to defeating soft body armor, but the high sectional density of the projectile can result in severe blunt force trauma.\n\n.50 Action Express (AE) - A very high powered pistol cartridge, exceeding the .44 Magnum, the cartridge''s combination of high velocity and mass results in very favorable penetration characteristics against hard cover and certain types of body armor. It is excellent in close quarters where the first shot is often the only one that counts.\n\n4.6x30mm H&K - H&K''s answer to the 5.7x28mm FN. Based on HK''s experimental 4.6x36mm cartridge for the HK36 ACR in the early ''70s, even retaining its unique Löffelspitz (spoon-nose) projectile. Like the FN entry, the 4.6x30mm has amazing armor penetration, yet recoils less than a 9x19mm pistol cartridge. The smaller HK projectile appears to gives superior penetration over the FN variant, but this also detracts from the permanent wound cavity. Best against unarmored targets, but can be used against armored.\n\n4.92x34mm H&K caseless - This revolutionary round encases the bullet in a combustible material. There is no brass holding the cartridge together and the "powder" is completely burned upon firing. The round itself is ballisticly similar to the 5.45x39mm Soviet but has better armor penetration. Good against all targets.\n\n\n\n\n5.45x18mm Soviet - Similiar to a necked down 6.35x16mm Browning (.25 ACP) and producing exterior ballistics equal to a .22 rimfire, 5.45x18mm cartridge possesses an impressive ability to defeat body armor. For best gameplay results, one should still restrict its use to unarmored targets only and use multiple shots.\n\n5.45x39mm Soviet - The Soviet''s response to the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge. While the long 5.45mm projectile doesn''t fragment like the 5.56x45mm NATO, it is more prone to reliably tumble/yaw. Good against all targets.\n\n5.56mm Steyr Flechette - Introduced for the US Army''s ACR trials, the Steyr cartridge uses a plastic case with a small caliber flechette pulled by a 5.56mm diameter sabot. The flechette is launched at a high velocity and the narrow projectile offers excellent penetration. However, this small diameter also reduces the terminal ballistics. Good against all targets but tends to wound more than kill.\n\n5.56x45mm NATO - Adopted by the US military in the 1960s, it later became the NATO standard rifle cartridge in the early ''80s, displacing the much more powerful 7.62x51mm. Good against all targets, but has trouble with heavy armor.\n\n5.7x28mm FN - The small high velocity cartridge used in FN''s new pistol and SMG appears much like a miniature rifle round. The 5.7mm FN cartridge has amazing armor penetration due to its small projectile size and speed, yet has much less recoil than many pistol rounds. However, don''t be tricked into believing that it is as powerful as a rifle cartridge. The ballistics are roughly pistol level with far superior penetration. Best against unarmored targets but can be used against armored.\n\n5.7x28mm FN subsonic - This round loses about 50% of its power due to the dramatic reduction in velocity. While the heavier projectile allows it to retain a portion of its armor penetration, its performance is severely hampered. Use against unarmored targets only and use multiple shots.\n\n7mm Remington Magnum - A long range hunting cartridge, the 7mm Remington Mag has its proponents among the US Secret Service (at least until recently) and those not emotionally tied to a .30" projectile. While less powerful than the.338 Lapua, it offers roughly the same power as .300 Winchester Magnum and far more power than the 7.62x51mm NATO. Good against all targets.\n\n7.62x39mm Soviet - The standard Soviet/ComBloc rifle cartridge from the mid-1940s to the mid-''70s, it is easily one of the most widely distributed cartridges in the world due to the distribution of the ubiquitous AK-47 series. Roughly equal in terminal performance with the 5.56x45mm NATO, it is far powerful less than 7.62x51mm NATO. Good against all targets.\n\n7.62x42mm Soviet - Outwardly similiar to the Nagant revolver cartridge, the 7.62x42mm Soviet''s case contains not only propellant and a projectile, but a piston sandwiched between the two. When the propellant is ignited, the expanding gas presses the piston forward to expel the projectile. However, the piston remains trapped inside the case, effectively sealing off the escape of propellant gas. The lack of expelled gas and a subsonic projectile results in no firing signature other than the mechanism of the parent weapon. The 7.62x42mm is credited with a maximum effective range of 50m, and the SP-4 armor-piercing cartridge can only defeat a helmet or body armor out to 25m. For best gameplay results, one should still restrict its use to unarmored targets only and use multiple shots.\n\n7.62x51mm NATO - This was the standard NATO rifle round until it''s gradual replacement by the 5.56x45mm. It is much more powerful than 5.56x45mm, but has considerable more recoil. It is now typically restricted to sniper rifles and GPMG. Good against all targets, but with lots of over penetration.\n\n7.62x51mm NATO Duplex - Originally designed to counter human-wave attacks, the M198 Duplex load fires two projectiles for one shot. Good against all targets.\n\n7.62x51mm NATO Match - A variation of the 7.62x51mm NATO, the cartridge uses a heavier projectile such as the 168gr or 175gr Sierra MatchKing. The production methods are tweaked to provide a high level of consistency and quality for the cartridges, which pays off in target group sizes. Good against all targets.\n\n7.62x51mm NATO Sabot - The sabot allows a .224" projectile to be fired from the larger 7.62x51mm case. This is designed to dramatically increase the short range velocity and penetration of the round. Good against all targets. Sabot is an archaic French word referring to a wooden shoe.\n\n7.62x54mmR Russian - The standard Russian rifle round from the 1890s to the mid-1940s, it is now confined to sniper rifles and GPMG. The "R" stands for rimmed. A little less powerful than 7.62x51mm NATO, but the target won''t quibble over the difference. Good against all targets.\n\n7.65x17mm Browning - A very small pistol round designed for...very small pistols. However, it was the predominant police service cartridge in Europe until the mid-1970s. It is the weakest of the cartridges in NATO 3 and Rogue Spear. Only useful against unarmored targets, and then only in volume.\n\n7.92x57mm Mauser - The standard German service rifle cartridge from 1888 to 1945, the 7.92x57mm (aka 8mm Mauser) has seen wide distribution around the globe through commercial, surplus, and military sales. Serbia continues to use it in sniper rifles and GPMG. It compares favorably to the 7.62x54mmR Russian and 7.62x51mm NATO. Good against all targets.\n9x19mm NATO - Invented for the German military at the turn of the century, the wide distribution of the 9x19mm Parabellum/Luger cartridge made it the logical choice for the NATO standard pistol and SMG round. While weaker than .40 S&W, it tends to have an advantage in weight and capacity. Fairly good against unarmored targets, but very weak against armor.\n\n9x19mm NATO subsonic - As suppressed 9x19mm weapons became more popular, purpose made subsonic cartridges were produced. In order to retain a portion of the energy for both weapon function and terminal ballstics, heavier the normal projectiles were substituted. The US Navy SEALs standardized on a 147gr loading due to its accuracy at 50 meters, allowing for reliable head shots from a suppressed MP5N. This round loses about 20% of it''s energy when subsonic. However, many US law enforcement agencies have followed the FBI''s advice and now use it as standard issue, even in unsuppressed weapons. The cartridge is weaker than .40 S&W subsonic and is roughly equal to the elderly .38 Special. Fairly good against unarmored targets, very weak against armor.\n\n9x21mm Russian - The 9x21mm Russian cartridge is roughly a lengthened version of the 9x18mm Makarov/PMM. Russian police have realized that the 9x18mm cartridges are barely adequate against criminals wearing body armor and driving sturdy Western European automobiles such as Mercedes-Benz. The armor-piercing RG-054 load is credited with defeating NIJ Threat Level IIIA armor out to 50m. While its muzzle energy is lower than the .40 S&W, it has an advantage in weight and capacity.\n\n9x23mm Winchester - Roughly a 9x19mm case lengthened by 4mm, the 9x23mm Winchester has its roots in IPSC competition shooting. John Ricco of CP Bullets had developed the ''9x23mm Super'' case as an alternative to the .38 Super ACP, whose cases varied dramaticly in strength. The .38 Super case also has the disadvantage of a vestigial semi-rim, which can interlock in magazines. Not to be confused with the externally similiar 9x23mm Bergmann-Bayard (aka 9mm Largo), Ricco''s case could be safely loaded to nearly double the chamber pressure of the older cartridges. Since Olin/Winchester produced the cases for Ricco, they saw the commercial potential for using the case in a loaded cartridge. Unfortunately, Olin/Winchester tried to cut Ricco out of his potential royalties from sale of the new 9x23mm Winchester. The resulting lawsuit (won by Ricco) and the poor marketing of 9x23mm pistols by Colt has led to tepid commercial acceptance. Despite these troubles, the 9x23mm Winchester comes closer to the goal of matching .357 Magnum ballistics than the more popular .357 SIG. Good against unarmored targets. \n\n9x30mm Grom - The 9x30mm Grom (Thunder) is roughly similar in dimensions and performance to the commercially unsuccessful 9mm Winchester Magnum. While its light projectile lacks sectional density, there is more than enough velocity to muscle through armor. It is compariable to the .357 Magnum and .30 US Carbine in similiar length barrels.\n9x39mm Soviet subsonic - The 9x39mm Soviet is roughly a 7.62x39mm Soviet case necked up for a heavy 9mm rifle projectile. There are competitive loadings from Nikolai Zabelin and Yuri Folov, each optimized for specific roles. It is compariable in performance to the .338 Whisper, but with slightly less penetration. Good against all targets; however, it can be unreliable against heavy armor.\n\n10x25mm Norma - Originally designed for the ill-fated Bren Ten pistol, the cartridge gained another lease on life when it was briefly promoted by the US FBI. Slightly more powerful than .45 ACP, the narrower projectile offers better penetration and greater effective range. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n10x25mm Norma subsonic - When the FBI''s Firearms Training Unit found that full-power 10x25mm loads were too powerful for the average user, the subsonic version was developed. This round loses about 40% of it''s power when subsonic. Slightly more powerful than .40 S&W subsonic, the 10x25mm subsonic was briefly the general issue sidearm cartridge of the FBI and continues in use in the FBI''s MP5/10 SMGs. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n12.7x99mm BMG (.50 BMG) - Originally designed to pierce tank armor in the First World War, the cartridge still serves an anti-materiel round against light armor. It is basically overkill against personnel. Use this for stopping vehicles.', 0, 1, '61.5.159.212', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 406, 6708),

Ideally when you begin what you do is have not more than 10 rounds in your pistol, first hold up the pistol to the target empty and sight in the bullseye and pull the trigger. Do this several times and you''ll notice if your hand is jerking or not at the pull of the trigger. Next chamber a bullet, and take your time to acquire the target, atleast 30 seconds before firing. After the round is fired look at the target closely to see where your bullet ended up, if it was off target think why, correct and then hold the pistol up again and fire. There should be atleast a 30 - 45 second delay between shots if you''re new. It is pointless to rapid fire your clip and it''s a waste of ammunition which is very expensive. Keep in your mind that the bullet you are firing is worth Rs. 40 to Rs. 50 each which is enough money to feed a person for a day.

Most shotguns are smooth bore.\n\nA rifled barrel is one which has grooves in it like a pistol or rifle. These makes the shot/bullet spin as it leaves the barrel which makes the bullet more steady and increases it''s range.\n\nA rifled barrel with a sabot round (picture given below) achieves about three times the range of a normal shotgun. Average ''effective'' range for a normal shotgun is about 150 feet (50 yards), a sabot fired from a rifled barrel increases that to 450-500 feet (150 yards) giving it rifle like range and stability. \n\nCut and paste from an article:\n[i]\nA smooth-bore slug barrel does not spin its projectile, so its range is limited. A smoothbore barrel with a screw-in rifled choke is somewhat better because it will impart at least some stabilizing spin to a departing solid or sabot-design slug, and a full-length-rifled barrel is best (which is why high-power rifles are not smoothbore). In general terms, sabots are intended to be spun. The faster they spin, the better they work, the more stable the flight of the projectile they enclose and the more consistently they separate from the bullet. So, the rule of thumb is essentially this: All types of slug ammo, sabot and non-sabot, provide their best accuracy and the longest effective range when fired in a full-rifle barrel. A smoothbore barrel with rifled choke tube will be somewhat less accurate, and a pure smoothbore offers the least accuracy. You can safely shoot all types of slugs in all types of barrels, but if you use premium-grade sabot ammo in a smoothbore, you''re wasting your money, and will likely get less accuracy than with a conventional old Foster-type soft lead slug, since the sabot won''t properly separate from the bullet and it actually de-stabilizes the trajectory more than a solid-type load.[/i]\n\nSource: [url]http://www.gameandfishmag.com/hunting/whitetail-deer-hunting/gf_aa106402a/[/url]', 0, 1, '203.81.194.221', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 431, 7197),

Lead is a very hard metal and it keep the shape of bullet after firing thus giving more accurate shot.\n\nHowever, there are some controversies rising against the use of lead in bullets, especially when use in hunting. What happens that when a bullet kills an hunted animal, the lead is sprayed in a fine mist (1 and a half foot around the wound) over the animal and in it''s meat. You can''t find lead sharp particles in bite but it''s in there.\n\nLead is very dangerous for children and pregnant women. It''s can stun mental growth of children and is a major cause of lower IQ in children. That''s why governments all over the world banned lead in paint.\n\nLead is also dangerous for scavenger animals and birds who eat on hunted animal after remains are left by hunters. \n\nIn last few years, large ammunition manufacturers like Winchester and Remington (and many others) are moving towards "green" or lead-free bullets.\n\nYet there is no ban by governments on larger scale on lead bullets but it''s hunters'' choice whether they use normal lead bullets or lead-free bullets.\n\nOne more thing is cost. Lead bullets are cheaper while lead-free bullets (usually made with copper) are more expensive.\n\nFor more information:\n[url]http://californiahuntingtoday.com/hogblog/[/url]\n[url]http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/85/i48/8548notw7.html[/url]\n[url]http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammunition/etipwin_100907/[/url]\n[url]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/01/15/new-remington-lead-free-ammo-disintegrator-varmint-and-copper-solid/[/url]\n[url]http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/03/04/green.bullets/index.html[/url]\n[url]http://www.frangiblebullets.com/[/url]\n\n\nWhat do you guys think of it?

I would like to share my personal observations with my friends.\n\nSince most of the shooters on the forum are more interested in big bore shooting, I shall restrict myself to the events of the big bore pistol at national level competitions. \n\nThe last shooting National Shooting Championship I attended was held at Jhelum in Nov 08 and as usual there were two big bore pistol events.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. BIG BORE PROFESSIONALS\n\nWeapons: All calibers are allowed except .22 and .32 (pistols or revolvers both allowed). Normally 9mms are used but I have seen one or two shooters using .38 special revolvers.\n\nDistance:  25 meters\n\nGrip        :  single handed\nTime       :  1 minute/shot – total shots 20  (4 series of 5 shots each).\nResults (first 10 positions):\nGold       Navy guy         190/200\nSilver         “       “          189\nBronze   Punjab             182        (Turkey made 9mm NOT Stoeger)\n4th                “               178        (don’t know)\n5th                “               173        (Beretta 9mm target grade model)\n6th           Army              172        \n7th           Punjab           171        (SIG 9mm target grade model)\n8th           Navy              167\n9th           Punjab           167\n10th         Army              165\n\nNOTE: There was no representation from Sindh or NWFP. Baluchistan participated but performed poorly.\n\n2. BIG BORE AMATEURS\n\nAll conditions are the same except DOUBLE HANDED GRIP IS ALLOWED. Only one shooter from Sindh participated, whose score was 25/200.\n\nAll top positions were taken up by army, navy and PAF.\n\nAny shooter who has not shot at national level before is eligible to enter as an amateur for the first time only.\n\nResults:\n\nGold    Army    185/200\nSilver      “       183\nBronze   “        179\n\nI hope this information is of some help to set the sights at.\n\nIf you have any queries you are very welcome to shoot.\n\nSeeing the targets and enthusiasm of my friends from Karachi, I really would love to meet you at the next Nationals representing Sindh.\n\nI do tend to go with the suggested 1000 rounds estimate though I believe it to be on the lower side.

The build quality is solid, firing it is very comfortable and a pleasure. But it does take some rounds to get used to it to become fairly accurate, I would say around 300 at least.  \n\nThere is a world of difference between this and the CF-98 which seems to be everyone''s bread and butter pistol. This fires better, looks better, is finished *much* better, has a better min round life (25k vs 8k for the CF98) and comes with a 20 round extended mag ! It is also very easy to clean, infact it the easiest pistol to take apart for cleaning I''ve ever used. Beretta 92/99 like slide disassembly only simpler. \n\nSome people were saying that the Kanuni has FTF & FTE issues. It is absoultly untrue, there are no such problems what so ever. To really test it I fired about 110 rounds of WAH from it and when it got nice and black from inside I put in the 20 round mag and rapid fired, fired great. I tried to take a picture of the inside of the barrel to show everyone that it still fired fine even after being so messy but it didn''t turn out so great.

The agreement between PAF and CATIC on the basis of “seller’s credit” was reached at a ceremony held here Saturday, whereby 42 fighter jets would be jointly produced for the use of PAF.\n\nThe agreement was signed on behalf of PAF by Chairman Pakistan Aeronautical Complex Air Marshal Khalid Chaudary and President CATIC MA Zhiping which was witnessed by Chief of the Air Staff PAF Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed and Ambassador of China to Pakistan Luo Zhaohui besides other senior officials from both the parties.

He said that PAF will get 40 JF-17 thunders this year.\n\nHe said first squadron of these highest quality fighter jets would be inducted in the PAF’s fleet by mid of this year as PAF has already been using 8 jointly produced aircraft for the last couple of years. This fleet would be raised in Peshawar, he added.\n\nAbout the delivery of AWACS system to Pakistan, he said that agreement had already been reached with a Chinese firm which would start its delivery by 2010. On the delivery of first AWACS system Pakistan would pay 10 % cost of the aircraft while the rest would be paid on easy installments basis, he said.\n\nAnswering a question, he said the agreement between Pakistan and China for the delivery of High-Tech aircraft J?10 was intact and these aircraft after improving them further would be delivered to PAF in 2014-15.\n[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SbLMq5lGnKI/AAAAAAAAAlg/03Y4ick6qpc/s400/Picture+Courtesy+M+Usman+peshawar_jf17sqn.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SbLMqtAfQPI/AAAAAAAAAlY/iXlM9mT6wKA/s400/2f9480d4031da9c4a7a6a296ef70e7c9.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SbLMqeav3PI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/Eq0kU9zIlGc/s400/1912aad6e3657d6746c14d0b10b6881c.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SbLMp1_xF1I/AAAAAAAAAlI/TFHFzizORuY/s400/40ae6435c179e883efce84f238533aba.jpg[/img]\nlink\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/03/paf-to-start-serial-production-of-jf-17.html[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.70.34', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 8287),

(6812, 373, 6773, 'Thunder', 124, '', 1236547238, '[b]Pakistan''s Growing Defense Industry[/b]\n\nU.S. Army Gen. William Westmoreland is reported to have said: "On the battlefield of the future, enemy forces will be located, tracked and targeted almost instantaneously through the use of data links, computer-assisted intelligence and automated fire control. … I am confident the American people expect this country to take full advantage of its technology–to welcome and applaud the developments that will replace wherever possible the man with the machine." It seems that this vision from the 1970s is being realized today. One manifestation of it is the development and deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles by many nations, including Pakistan.\n\nThe growing reliance on armed drones (aka predators) by Americans in Afghanistan and Pakistan''s FATA region to target militants has been making headlines with increasing casualties. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or Drones designed and manufactured in Pakistan have also been making news since IDEAS 2008 event in Karachi, Pakistan held in November of last year. Integrated Dynamics, a privately held Pakistani company that drew attention at IDEAS 2008 expo, is a developer and manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nIntegrated Dynamics is a full-service UAV systems provider based in Karachi, Pakistan. The company has been in business since 1997 and designs and integrates UAV systems primarily for the Government of Pakistan, the Pakistan armed forces and export. The company says they are committed to the use of the UAV system as a scientific and defensive tool that can be used to save lives and monitor potentially hostile environments for human personnel. The company also makes drones such as the turbojet-powered Tornado decoy, which can fly up to 200 kilometers, and emit false radar signals to "confuse enemy air defenses into thinking they are attacking aircraft," according to Defense News of Pakistan.\n\nIn addition to supplying drones to Pakistani military, the company exports its products to Australia, Spain, South Korea and Libya and the United States. The US homeland security department uses its Border Eagle surveillance drone for border patrol duties. Integrated Dynamics'' products cost only a fraction of the cost of comparable products made in the United States and Europe. ID UAV prices start from about $ 20,000 while comparable UAV products made in the West start from about $ 200,000, according to the Karachi-based company. The ID models have operational range of 20 to 1600 kilometers.\n\nIntegrated Dynamics began developing the Firefly mini-rocket UAV in late 2004 in response to Pakistani army operational requirements for a high-speed, short-range observation system that could be used in the high-altitude environments of northern Pakistan. A basic system costs around $3,000 and comprises four rockets, a launcher, a carry case, datalink and a PDA-based ground control station.The UAV company is an example of a new generation of private defense companies in Pakistan that have grown with the emerging needs of Pakistani military and export opportunities to both military and civilian sectors abroad.\n\n\n[b]Arms as Pakistan''s Cottage Industry[/b]\n\nPakistan has a long history of arms manufacturing as a cottage industry. The dusty little town of Darra Adam Khel,only a half-hour drive from Peshawar, reminds visitors of America''s Wild West. The craftsmen of this town are manufacturers and suppliers of small arms to the tribal residents of the nation''s Federally Administered Tribal Areas who carry weapons as part of their ancient culture. The skilled craftsmen of FATA make revolvers, automatic pistols, shotguns and AK-47 rifles. Until five years ago, the list also had items such as anti-personnel mines, sub-machine guns, small cannons and even rocket launchers. Pakistani government has forced the tribesmen to stop making heavy assault weapons to try and prevent the Taliban and Al Qaeda from getting access to such weapons.\n\nPakistan''s arms industry has come a long way from making small arms as a cottage industry in the last few decades. The US and Western arms embargoes imposed on Pakistan at critical moments in its history have proved to be a blessing in disguise. In particular, the problems Pakistan faced in the aftermath of Pressler Amendment in 1992 became an opportunity for the country to rely on indigenous development and production of defense equipment.\n\n[b]Pakistan''s Military Industrial Complex[/b]\n\nThe country now boasts a powerful industrial, technological and research base developing and manufacturing for its armed forces and exporting a wide variety of small and large weapons ranging from modern fighter jets, battle tanks, armored vehicles, frigates and submarines to unmanned aerial vehicles and high tech firearms and personal grenade launchers for urban combat. Some of these items were on display at IDEAS 2008, the 5-day biennial arms show held November last year in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nPakistan has become an increasingly important player in the world arms industry, a global industry and business which manufactures and sells weapons and military technology and equipment. Arms production companies, also referred to as Defense Contractors, produce arms mainly for the armed forces of nation states. Products include guns, ammunition, missiles, military aircraft, military vehicles, ships, electronic Systems, and more. The arms industry also conducts significant research and development. Pakistan''s major defense manufacturing companies are owned and operated by Pakistan''s military. According to Business Monitor, Pakistan''s defense industry contains over 20 major public sector units (PSUs) and over 100 private-sector firms. The majority of major weapons systems production and assembly is undertaken by the state-owned PSUs, while the private-sector supplies parts, components, bladed weapons and field equipment. Major PSUs include the Pakistan Ordnance Factory (POF), Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT), Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works (KSEW) and the Pakistan Machine Tool Factory. Multinational presence in Pakistan is limited, although joint production or engineering support in the development of certain armaments has recently occurred with companies such as DCN International and the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.\n\nIDEAS 2000, Pakistan''s first major arms show, was organized after former President Musharraf assumed leadership of the country in the wake of the 1999 bloodless coup that toppled the Nawaz Sharif government. At the show, the former president emphasized the need to grow Pakistan''s defense industry and private sector involvement in R&D;, manufacturing and marketing of arms. Held every two years since the year 2000, the show has become a runaway success. It has helped Pakistan and other friendly nations to show off their wares, find customers, share knowledge, build bilateral partnerships, encourage scientific innovation and learning among young people and made visitors and Pakistani citizens more aware of the role defense industry plays in national defense and economy. Held in November last year, International Defense Exhibition and Seminar 2008 attracted 256 companies including 162 foreign and 94 Pakistani companies. Among the largest foreign pavilions, Turkey had 28 companies and United States had 22. Other major exhibitors came from China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, the Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Among other products, Pakistani companies showed off JF-17 fighter plane built by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex in partnership with China''s Chengdu Aircraft, Al-Khalid main battle tank, POF eye capable of shooting around corners and launching grenades in urban combat, and a variety of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) designed, developed and built in Pakistan.\n\n[b]World Arms Market[/b]\n\nIt is estimated that yearly, over 1 trillion dollars are spent on military expenditures worldwide (2% of World GDP). Part of this goes to the procurement of military hardware and services from the military industry. The combined arms sales of the top 100 largest arms producing companies amounted to an estimated $315 billion in 2006. In 2004 over $30 billion were spent in the international arms trade (excluding domestic arms sales). Many industrialized countries have a domestic arms industry to supply their own military forces. Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens. The illegal trade in small arms is prevalent in many countries and regions affected by political instability.\n\n[b]Pakistan''s Arms Business[/b]\n\nIn a July 2008 interview with Pakistan''s Dawn newspaper, Major General Mohammad Farooq, Director General of the Defense Export Promotion Organization, indicated that collaboration with the United States had increased in manufacturing armored personnel carriers "with transfer of technology". There have been unconfirmed reports that Pakistan is manufacturing Humvees for the US military in Afghanistan. General Farooq also claimed that Pakistan''s defense exports have tripled to around $300 million because of the quality of its ammunition, anti-tank guided missiles, rocket launchers and shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. He said exports to South Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries had increased significantly. It has been reported that Sri Lanka has purchased cluster bombs, deep penetration bombs and rockets and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) from Pakistan.\nGeneral Farooq said optical instruments like night vision devices, laser range-finders and designators, laser threat sensors, artillery armor mortars and munition, mine detectors, anti-tank rifles, missile boats, different types of tear gases, fuses of unarmed vehicles, security equipment and sporting and hunting guns were also being manufactured in Pakistan. "The fuses are being purchased by countries like Italy, France and Spain," he said.\n\nIn reply to a question, he said Pakistan''s military exports were higher than India''s. "Indians started working on Arjun tank but, they are yet to induct it in their army, while Pakistan has built and handed over Al Khalid tank to the army, although it started the program later," he said.\n\nLately, Pakistan has come under severe criticism by human rights groups for being a leading manufacturer and exporter of land-mines, cluster bombs and depleted uranium munitions.\n\n[b]High-Tech Aerial Warfare[/b]\n\nThe three main branches of Pakistani military are evaluating UAVs made in Pakistan and the rest of the world for purchase and deployment. Pakistan has been eager to boost its capabilities for high-tech aerial warfare and restructure and reorient its military to respond to the new and emerging challenges of combating insurgents. A number of public and private sector companies have been engaged in research, development and manufacturing of unmanned aerial vehicles as a part of this initiative. The public sector companies include Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Air Weapons Complex and National Development Complex.\nHere''s a brief run-down of the status of Pakistan''s three military services as gleaned from Jane''s and other publications:\n\n[b]Pakistan Air Force[/b]\n\nAs part of its effort to go high-tech, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) will formally induct unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into service for the first time in 2009, the chief of the PAF has told Jane''s. In addition to the Bravo+ UAV, which, according to PAF Chief Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed, has been built indigenously by Air Weapons Complex, the PAF will also receive the Falco UAVs produced by Selex Galileo of Italy. The two systems will be used mainly for aerial reconnaissance and information gathering, although the PAF will later also induct UAVs equipped with weapon systems to carry out offensive operations. "This capability we are developing fairly rapidly; we are becoming mature. It is part of our operations now and I look forward to seeing this in real operations by [the] beginning [of] 2009," ACM Ahmed reportedly told Jane''s.\n\n[b]Pakistan Army[/b]\n\nThe Uqaab, Pakistan Army''s drone designed and built by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, is the first step towards the eventual mass production of a Pakistani UAV. Technical details shared by Pakistani officials suggest that the Uqaab can fly at an altitude of about 15,000 ft and is equipped with day- and night-vision equipment. There have been unconfirmed reports that Pakistan has discussed with China the possibility of further developing the Uqaab to carry a weapons payload, according to Jane''s.\n[b]\nPakistan Navy[/b]\n\nPakistan Navy is reportedly interested in deploying vertical takeoff and landing UAVs on its ship. As a part of its plans to purchase and deploy UAVs, the Pakistani navy has completed trials of Austrian Schiebel Camcopter S-100 and Swedish made Cybaero autonomous VTOL UAVs from a Pakistani frigate in the Arabian sea in April 2008.\n\n[b]Pakistan''s UAV Industry[/b]\n\nGrowing interest by Pakistani military and foreign companies and governments has helped spawn several private Pakistani UAV companies specializing in air-frames, launch and propulsion, flight control, tele-command and control systems, signal intelligence, training simulators, etc. Some of the private companies involved in UAV development and manufacturing include Integrated Dynamics, East-West Infinity, Satuma and Global Industrial Defense Solutions. Between the public and private sector UAVs developed in Pakistan, there is a long list of products including Bravo and Uqaab by Air Weapons Complex, Heliquad by East-West Infinity, Nishan Mk1 , Vision MK1 , Vision MK2 , Nishan TJ 1000, Tornado, Border Eagle, Hornet, Hawk, Hawk Mk1, Shadow and Vector by Integrated Dynamics Pakistan, Flamingo, Jasoos and Mukhbar by Satuma Pakistan , Bazz and Ababeel by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. These products vary in payload type, size and weight, engine types, range, flying altitude, endurance and launch and recovery systems. Growing domestic and international demand and increasing competition among suppliers is expected to produce significant improvements in capabilities and quality of the UAV products offered by Pakistani companies. In addition to Integrated Dynamics described above, here are three more UAV companies in Pakistan:\n\n[b]East-West Infinity:[/b]\n\nOne of the companies at the forefront of UAV development is East West Infinity (EWI). EWI''s latest products are the Heliquad micro tactical UAV and the Whisper Watch signals intelligence (SIGINT) package.\nThe Heliquad was first displayed in prototype form at the IDEAS2006 defense exhibition. Equipped with a tiny camera, it can relay pictures back to troops or special forces in an urban environment or in the field, giving them a tactical reconnaissance capability. Being exceptionally small and powered by four electric motors, Heliquad is highly stealthy and represents the cutting edge of EWI''s electronics miniaturization. SIGINT has become more important with ongoing anti-terrorism operations on the western front and in the tribal areas. Designed for militaries unable to afford high-end, dedicated SIGINT platforms, the company says its Whisper Watch platform is most effective when aerostat-mounted, as the platform is stationary and airborne for longer.\n\n[b]Satuma[/b]\n\nSatuma (Surveillance and Target Unmanned Aircraft), founded in 1989, is small UAV specialist company based near Islamabad, Pakistan. Satuma products include Flamingo, Jasoos and Mukhbar UAVs. Its biggest customer is Pakistan''s military.\n\n[b]Global Industrial Defense Solutions:[/b]\nGIDS, the largest of the private defense sector companies, has a UAV division, which produces a whole range of operational and training UAVs.Its biggest customer in Pakistan''s military. The UAVs developed by GIDS have been extensively flight tested by military. GIDS ground control stations have an interactive and user friendly interface, where flight parameters and auto-pilot mission planning, and execution is done in addition to reception of high-enbd crisp quality video transmitted over an encrypted digital link.\nHeaded by a retired PAF Air Vice Marshall, GIDS has emerged from a combination of 7 Pakistani private defense companies that include AERO (Advanced Engineering Research Organization), IDS (Integrated Defense Systems), MSL (Maritime Systems Pvt Limited), ACES (Advanced Computing and Engineering Solutions), IICS (Institute of Industrial Control Systems), ATCOP (AI-Technique Corporation) and SETS (Scientific Engineering and Technology Solutions). Other than UAVs, its major products include anti-personnnel, anti-armor, incendiary, anti-runway, electronic impact and time-based fuses, electronic warfare equipment, navigation systems, optical fiber and optical fiber cables. Anti-tank Wire Guided Missile System known as "Baktar Shiken" made by IICS, a component of GIDS.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nPakistan''s growing defense industry is going high tech to keep up with the challenges of a changing world that requires advanced weapons and new strategies to maintain peace and stability in a hostile neighborhood. At the same time, Pakistan''s defense industry is contributing to scientific, technological, industrial and economic development of the nation by training and employing thousands of citizens. The investments made in defense production are a good bargain for the companies, their investors and the taxpayers of Pakistan to help ensure the nation''s economic, political and national security against both internal and external threats.\n\n[url]http://www.zimbio.com/South+Asia+Investor+Review/articles/75/Pakistan+Growing+Defense+Industry[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.232.10', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 8332),

If ALL bolt-action rifles are NPB now, what about the licenses issued mentioning .22 Rifle on them?\n    a. Can another bore bolt-action rifle be bought on it without making any changes?\n\n3. What is the process of transferring a father''s licenses PB & NPB (not just the weapon) in own name? In both scenarios of father being alive or deceased.\n\n4. A PB license by origin or weapon specific is what is generally known. Are there any other ones like open PB licenses without specifying bore or weapon?\n\n5.

These included murders, attempted murders, robberies, edacities and aerial firing.\n\nMost of the cases occurred in contravention of 13 Arms Ordinance meaning that shots were fired from unlicensed weapons. Most of the firearm cases took place in Bannu, Tank and North and South Waziristan.\n\nPeople in the province have an estimated 1 million Kalashnikovs and Kalakovs and only five per cent of them are licensed. These licences were issued on political basis during the tenure of late prime minister Mohammad Khan Jonejo.\n\nThe government had some 10 years ago launched a drive to cleanse the country of automatic weapons, but that didn’t bear the desired results and the menace continued unabated.\n\nA Kalashnikov or AK-47, which had been sold at Rs65,000 in 1976, is now easily available at Rs5,000. “There is no misfire and magazines with the capacity of 75 cartridges can be sued in it,” said a weapon expert.\n\nMarkets in Darra Adamkhel, Khyber, Mohmand, North and South Waziristan and Bajaur agencies are replete with automatic weapons made of Russia, Hungary, China, Egypt, Bulgaria, Finland, Iraq, North Korea and Germany.\n\nSources said the people could get weapons in any part of the country after making an advance payment to the dealers in Fata.\n\n“Though the WAH factory manufactures weapons for armed forces, police and law-enforcement personnel, parts of G-3 automatic guns smuggled from the factory are assembled in the Darra Adamkhel market,” said forensic experts.\n\nThey said that it was hard to determine the entry and exit points of bullets in firearm victims because of multiple and, some time, countless shots. They said that the number of contact injuries had also registered a surge because bullets injured untargeted persons after piercing through the targeted ones.\n\nPolice said that Abbottabad, Mansehra, Battagram and Kohistan were a few districts where people still used 12, 16 and 20 bore guns.\n\nThese types are used for hunting purposes in other parts of the NWFP and Fata.The unlimited trade of illegal weapons has assumed alarming proportion. The sources said the latest additions to this trade are US weapons which were seized from American forces during ambushes in Afghanistan.\n\nThey said that police often seized huge quantity of illegal weapons. The seized weapons, they said, were replaced with dummy weapons before being shifted to the weapon storage of the police department.\n\nSource:[url]http://www.dawn.com/2007/09/08/nat21.htm[/url]', 0, 1, '119.154.42.187', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 274, 8508),

THese license have either been free of fees army licenses with dad or dada''s ranks on them or of the regular civilian type:(pls bear in mind that this is on personal experience also)\n\n1. a) under current definition the .22 condition is only applicable for semi-auto rifles. Any bolt action rifle calibre incldg .308 (G3 ammo), 7 mm, .222 etc can be entered on the license and maintained.\n    b) if the exisiting rifle is taken off you can enter any bolt action rifle on it. if you do it immediately no issue but if you keep the license free of weapon you will need a stamp of ''purchase validity extension'' for either 6 mths or 1 mth from either the DCO office or Home Deptt.\n\n2. again the .22 condition is for semi auto rifles and not applicable to bolt actions.\n\n3. you cannot get the arms license for your father (or father in law) transferred in your name if the parents are alive. if the parent has passed away the weapon has to be deposited with the home office pending arms license transfer. the same can be done by using the form that is attached on the pakguns website under forms. there is a section related to transfer of license and weapon. for a prohibited bore it might not be passed but for a npb there is usually no issue. in either case you will need a death certificate and a noc from other heirs nominating you as the rightful heir. ( i advise that in the case parents are alive just enter yourself as a retainer on the license and use that. i have as a retainer even transported my grand parent''s weapons on domestic flights and till recently. another frined of mine who''s father was tragically killed a few years back applied to transfer his fahther''s old licenses to his name. he was successful but got screwed over as new books were issued and he lost the right to non .22 semi autos on the rifle licenses. 12 bores and pistols were not effected. PB license was cancelled) \n\n4. yes there are open PB licenses as the same has depended on issuing authority or even the clerk writing the license out. generally for local use the PB is for the 7.62 calibre used in ak''s. (my dad''s m-16 that he had bought back from a navy seals course in phillipines was under a 223 license and never subjected to a PB license) so just depends. also PB would be for fully auto weapons and hence limited choices. guess sometimes it would depend on luck. again if you''re looking for a ak (or kk) u shouldn be worried as that would be covered under the PB.\n\n5. the last would happen when the licenses issued in a certain period are cancelled. so yes theoretically changing the policy would chnage the status of the license and conditions but difficult to implement. tricky one and i haven had an experience for this scenario.', 0, 1, '125.161.132.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 274, 8511),

I think I have an idea of what I want to say but any input will be appreciated.\n \n[B]1. What are the personal and professional strengths that make you successful?[/B]\n\n    Damn that! Don''t you even know? What kinda fool are you that you don''t  know that already?! I''m awesome. That''s it. Simple. I have to work with  fools all the time so my awesomosity gets all the more vivid and  outstanding. Yeah, that. Go play with your toys, kid.\n\n[B]2. Please indicate your key work accomplishments and achievements from the past 12-18 months.[/B]\n\n    Whatever, fool! I have endured working in this crappy office and these  stupid people for the past 18 months or so. Ain''t that a major  accomplishment in itself? I mean ... really! An awesome, girl like  myself, working with fools I have all around me all the time. Darn! I  should get an immediate increment of 70% in my salary just for that one  thing. Are you in the account dept? Hey! If you are, we can get away  with a major "work" behind the curtain. You know what I''m saying? ;)  Here''s my personal cell number. Ring me some day. Maybe we can go on a  date or something.\n\n[B]3. What are your short term career goals (0-3 years)?[/B]\n\n    I want to learn how to smoke! God, I just lovvve smoking. Every night I  lay in my bed with the ciggy and the lighter and I keep trying smoking.  But I know I have to join a professional institution for that. An  amazing skill like that can''t be learnt at home :(\n\n   I want to  stab John (he''s my stupid boss). He keeps giving me work while I''m at  the office. He also never gives me proper "attention" no matter how hard  I try. Once I went to work in miniskirt and half sleeves in winter, but  the idiot just looked at me and offered to arrange a gas heater at my  desk. The douchebag has no idea how to treat a lady!\n\n   I also  want to stab Rosaline (that biatch is my boss'' personal secretary). No  matter how hard I try, she always looks and smells better than me. John  never even looks at me the second time after he''s seen that biatch. Oh I  want to stab her sooo hard! The cheap birch needs die in pain!\n\n    I want to shoot Fernando. He''s the head of the accounts department. I  tried to make a "deal" with him about some experimentation with the  company''s funds, but the idiot just refused and threatened to inform the  officials in case I didn''t stop. Damn! How much I have had to try to  convince him I was joking. He will learn the truth after I''m through  sending 6 bullets in his chest. That mofo son of a ...!\n\n[B]4. What are your long term career goals (3+ years)?[/B]\n\n    What the hell?! Do you want me to shoot you with Fernando, too? What do  you think I typed in the above field? Were you sleeping or something?\n\n[B]5. What development activities and/ or needs are required to help in achieving your career goals?[/B]\n\n    I need to learn smoking! Damn, didn''t I mention it already?! Hell,  every time I mention it, I can''t stop crying. Oh Goodness! When ... just  WHEN will I learn this awesome skill? Man, every time I see guys  exhaling smoke, the smoker inside me just ... ugh ... forget it!\n\n    I also need to learn how to use a gun. I mean ... I know how they use  in the movies and all, but I''ve never held a real gun in my hands. My ex  once bought a gun for home security but I was too terrified to touch  it. That was none of my fault, though. It was all black and he said IT  SHOOTS BULLETS! Like ... really! I hope the same institution which  teaches smoking will also teach me handling guns. If you know a joint  course for both these skills, drop me a text. My personal cell number is  given at the end.\n\n   Ummm ... I think after taking care of  Fernando, I will need to make a fresh deal with whoever they appoint as  the new head of the accounts department. I need to start working on that  right now.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nOne of these days sand...one of these days you are going to royally screw up. yourself or somebody else.\nBut it will be rather amusing.\nDo tell us when it happens.', 1, 0, '86.135.211.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The PAF has achieved such a deterrence level that no one can cast an evil eye on the motherland, he said. Air Chief?designate Air Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman (Deputy Chief of Air Staff perations), who will take over the PAF’s command on Wednesday was also present with the Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed on the accession.\n\n\nAir Marshal Rao is architect of an effective strategy to deal with the Indian threat of carrying out surgical strikes against Pakistan. Due to this strategy the adversary had to shelve its nefarious plan of surgical operations. Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mehmmod Ahmed said that the country achieved nuclear power back in 1998 with the aim that the defence of the country be made impregnable and over the years PAF has been able to successfully achieve the target. “We fought two wars with India in 1965 and 1971 and prevented three imminent wars in 1998, 2002 and in recent days in the aftermath of Mumbai attacks.” India had threatened Pakistan of undertaking surgical strikes against her but seeing the level of preparedness and alertness of PAF the looming dangers from the adversary were averted effectively, which showed that the attainment of nuclear power has helped in achieving peace in the region.\n\n\n“It helped deter any misadventure in the region.” he said. Answering a question, he said 95 % of PAF personnel and officers are not out to earn livelihood but they joined PAF with the passion to defend the motherland through obtaining mastery over the machine and ammo. Talking about the last ten years, the Air Chief said the PAF today is much more effective and potent force than what it was in 1998 and it shall continue to excel further with the passage of time. Earlier, making remarks at the book launching, the Air Chief termed all the sanctions imposed by the west from time to time in the past a s blessing in disguise saying “this helped us a lot to achieve indiginization of technology. It has brought us at the higher pedestal.” “We would have not gone nuclear. We are now a nuclear state and it is all due to the sanctions,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe co?production with China of a modern fighter aircraft like JF?17 Thunder is also an outcome of the sanctions. “We achieved all that with minimal spending while living within our limited financial resources.” About the book he said the author Alan Warne (Editor of UK based Air Forces Monthly) has written the book on his own as the PAF had facilitated the writer to carry out his work with an unbiased approach independently. He appreciated the efforts of the writer for creating a masterpiece within a short span of about 15 months. He said the book covers past, present and future of the PAF, presenting salute to heros of the force besides shedding light on future plans. He also appreciated the services of former Director Public Relations (Air) Air Commodore Sarfraz Ahmed Khan for facilitating the author for accomplishment of his task.\n\n\nHe also mentioned the DPR (Air) Air Commodore Humayun and his able team in the Directorate. Earlier, the author of the book said that the PAF during the last 40 years had been undergoing sanctions and despite all that what it has achieved is highly appreciable. PAF is the only air force of the world which has been co?building modern fighter aircraft like JF?17 Thunder, he said.

They were taken onboard two Pakistan Navy (PN) main warships, PNS Tippu Sultan and PNS Tariq, to witness the first day of the operational sea of the Aman exercise that remained in progress from March 9 to March 12.Out of the 38 countries from different regions, navies of 11 countries actively participated in the Aman 2009 maritime exercise, bringing their ships, aircraft, naval officers, and sailors.\n\nEight warships of Pakistan Navy and 11 other ships from navies of the USA, the UK, Bangladesh, China, Australia, France and Malaysia were present on the first day of the operational sea phase of Aman exercise.In the evening, these ships also took part in a surface firing competition in the open sea. The main surface guns of ships fired at a glowing target in the open sea dropped at a distance of seven to eight Nautical Miles.\n\nAs the two PN warships, of type-21 class and Britain made, had to remain in the open seas during four days of operational phase of the Aman, news personnel were shifted from PNS Tippu Sultan and PNS Tariq to two missile boats of PN for their return journey to the naval dockyard at the Karachi port. This shifting – in maritime and naval warfare terms – is called Personnel Replenishment at sea between ships.The personnel replenishment exercise in the open sea took place through small “Zulu” boats. A wooden ship ladder and two ropes hanging seaward vertically from the ship were used to help descending journalists; an activity demanding mental alertness and physical balance to enable them to safely get down onto the small rubber-inflated boats.\n\n\nIt took at least 90 minutes for the crews of PNS Tippu Sultan and PNS Tariq and those riding the Zulu boats including the PN divers to ensure the safe transfer of journalists from the ships to the missile boats.Officials and sailors at the warships and missile boats said that the phenomenally calm and smooth sea conditions during personnel replenishment were instrumental in the safe vessel-to-vessel transfer of media personnel, which included a female journalist.PN spokesman Commander Salman Ali said that by involving the media in the personnel replenishment exercise between ships, they were given a chance to have a glimpse of the outstanding mental and physical alertness, fitness, and determined ruggedness required of the seafarers associated with the country’s naval force.\n\nThe dropping of PN commandos on deck of moving ships through Sea King helicopters was also highly appreciated by news personnel.Lieutenant Zia, who led the squad of Special Service Group of the navy which landed on PNS Tippu Sultan, said that the aerial dropping technique of commandos, which is otherwise called Visit Boat Search and Seize operation against enemy ships, had attained salience once again in the backdrop of international maritime efforts against pirates operating off the coast of Somalia.The visiting newsmen also witnessed joint flypast by helicopters, maritime surveillance aircraft and fighter jets from Pakistan Navies and naval forces of other participating countries. The participation of P-3C Orion of the Japanese navy and Mirage-5 fighter jets of No. 8 Squadron of PN were the distinguishing features of the flypast.\n\nAlouette helicopters of PN performed deck landing on warships. Helicopters of other participating naval forces performed cross deck landing on each other’s ships.Talking to media personnel, Commanding Officer of PNS Tippu Sultan Captain Zubair Shafique said that warships from different navies of the world had been participating in the sea exercise to understand operational procedures utilised by other naval forces against common maritime threats.He added that the joint exercise would help in increasing interoperability of various naval forces against common maritime menaces of terrorism, piracy, drug, and human smuggling.', 0, 1, '118.103.237.102', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 9795),

Sales are low and, in order to increase them, he comes up with a plan to allow his customers to eat now and pay later. He keeps track of the meals consumed on a ledger.\n\nWord gets around and as a result increasing numbers of customers flock to Pajja’s shop. Pajja’s suppliers are delighted and are very willing to sell more and more raw materials for the meals he prepares. Pajja shows them his ledger of receivables and they extend him credit.\n\nA young and dynamic customer service consultant at the local bank recognizes these customer debts as valuable future assets and gives Pajja a credit line and then increases Pajja’s borrowing limit.\n\nTaking advantage of his customers'' freedom from immediate payment constraints, Pajja jacks up the prices of his Nehari and Siri-Paye. Customers dont mind as they are not required to pay on the spot. Sales volume increases massively; Banks and suppliers lend more; Pajja opens more outlets. He sees no reason for undue concern since he has the debts of the customers as collateral.\n\nAt the bank''s corporate headquarters, expert bankers recognize Pajja''s customer loans as assets and transform these customer assets into BONDS. These negotiable instruments are given exotic names such as SIRIBOND, PAYABOND, MAGHAZBOND AND BONGBOND. These securities are then listed on the Stock Exchange and traded on markets worldwide. No one really understands what the names mean and how the securities are guaranteed but, nevertheless, as their prices continuously climb, the securities become top-selling items.\n\nOne day, although the prices are still climbing, a credit risk manager of the bank decides that the time has come to demand payment of one of the debts incurred by Pajja. Pajja in turn asks his clients to pay up. One by one they refuse; the clients cannot pay back the debts. Pajja refuses to serve them any more. The clients stop coming.\n\nPajja is really screwed now. He cannot fulfill his loan obligations and therefore claims bankruptcy. All Bonds drop in price by between 80 to 95%.\n\nThe suppliers of Pajja, having granted generous payment due dates and having invested in the securities are faced with similar problems. The meat supplier defaults on payment to the sheep and cattle supplier and claims bankruptcy. The atta supplier is taken over by a competitor; Pajja lays off the cook and staff. Bankruptcies soar, unemployment mushrooms.\n\nThe bank that lent the money in the first place is set to collapse. It is saved by the Government following dramatic round-the-clock consultations by leaders from the governing political parties with Pajja commuting back and forth in his Executive jet and Mercedes 500SEL, brokering the deal.\n\nThe funds required to save the economic collapse are obtained by a tax levied on the citizens, most of whom do not eat Nehari or Siri-paye.\n\nUNDERSTOOD?', 0, 1, '202.70.159.202', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 561, 10167),

"They will be very disappointed by this,” one said.\n\nThe J-10, which China has taken about 20 years to make, was on a training exercise with deputy regiment air force commander Li Feng at the controls. He tried to exercise a tricky manoeuvre at an altitude of 4,500 metres when the engine failed, state media reported. Realising the the jet could lose power at any time, he requested permission to return.\n\nStiill seven kilometers from the airfield, the engine stopped and the jet began to lose altitude at a rate of 25 metres per second. The pilot succeeded in gliding the fighter onto the runway without power. The rear parachute also failed, but he succeeded in bringing the fighter to a halt after taxiing for some 1,400 metres down the runway. The entire landing took 104 seconds, state television said. The success of the pilot may have influenced their decision to broadcast the landing.\n\nOne aviation expert said that the skill of the pilot should not be underestimated. He said: “A fighter jet glides like a soggy brick.”\n\nIt was the first reported incident involving the J-10 since it was unveiled with great fanfare before an international audience at the Zhuhai air show in southern China last November. It received several impressive reviews of its performance at the time. Vladimir Karnozov, a Mosco-based aerospace journalist, wrote a blog calling the J-10 the real deal. He said: “The pilot did none of the show tricks like post-stall or tail slide or pitch-back, but turns were very tight, initial rate of turn very high. It was clear there is a lot of potential in this airplane to achieve the same maneuvers more quickly. “\n\nHowever, diplomats said question marks still hung over the plane, which has taken some 20 years to develop. Most involve its engine.\n\nAll the J-10 fighters built so far are believed to be powered by a single Russian-built turbofan engine, the AL-31F. Diplomats said that there had been problems adapting the plane and the engine to fit, adding that the use of a Russian engine could affect Chinese plans to sell the jet overseas. China already has an order for 40 of the fighters from Pakistan.\n\nThey said that China was keen to install its own engine in the aircraft but so far this had not been possible. Chinese media said last year that the PLA had finally developed an indigenous turbojet engine called the WS-10A, or "Taihang", as it is known commercially, and had started installing it in the J-10.\n\nChinese-made engines are currently used in the twin-engine J-8, which is based on the design of the Russian Sukhoi-15 fighter, but these are still being adapted to the far more rigorous demands of a single-engine jet. The Chinese engine is believed to take twice as long as the Russian one to reach the same level of performance: the lag of up to one minute could mean the difference between life or death for a pilot needing to restart his engine or eject. The aviation expert said: “These single-engine fighters are often known as widow-makers.”\n\nExperts said that China was apparently still trying to adapt its domestic engines to power the J-10. Its programme faces additional urgency since the PLA may be keen to use fully homemade fighters once it builds its own aircraft carrier. Several senior officers have indicated China’s construction of such a group is now only a matter of time.\n\nlink\n\n[url]http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/worl...icle5961023.ece[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.74.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 10850),

We''ll see what the folk at TFL taught you ;)\n\nI think someone mentioned in another thread if you lived on a farm, a fixed stock and slugs might work fine but in our 2/4 kanal houses. The attacker will be able to put 4 bullets in you before you are able raise your shotgun to your shoulder. In small spaces the small the weapon the more faster the response. For the same reason you have the M16 and then you have the M4, the Ak47 and the AKS74. Smaller weapons with high hitting power are required for HD/SD. The most ideal shotgun for SD is a Mossberg with a 14/16 inch barrel with a pistol grip. No replacement for it.[/quote]\nOK,i will answer this all step by step.just tell me how much big houses in North America?they usually dont have big houses like ours, here in Pakistan.But they still use full stock for their HD shotgun.\nsecondly the rifles u r talking about these r all semi auto.in these rifles recoil is not too much.u can handle them in pistol grip only mod.but a 12 gauge recoil is much more than semi auto rifle.and at very close distances ur shot''s pattern will be so tight that u need a good aim of ur target.with a pistol grip only shotgun u cant aim or shoot ur target properly.\nanyways this is all about personal preference.and i am very comfertable with my full stock shottie.YMMV', 0, 1, '119.154.68.202', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 590, 10899),

Reminiscent of the DSI modification first tested on a Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 30 in 1996, this modification saves weight and improves specific engine power and stealth. It also cleans up the J-10''s previous complex inlet configuration, which was reportedly prone to vibration.\n\nChina''s research on DSIs dates back to the late 1990s, with Chengdu''s 611 institute for aerospace design having been assisted by government-funded research at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\nIn addition, this J-10 variant has a new infrared search and track (IRST) system canted to the right of the windscreen, with an apparent smaller optical sensor below the radome area, and a new electronic systems faring near the top of the vertical stabiliser, also similar to that of the FC-1. In addition, the radome has been changed to a flatter F-16-like profile. The back-leaning angle of the radome attachment bulkhead gives credence to web reports suggesting it also has a new radar, perhaps a new electronically scanned array, either active or passive.\n\neither a new more powerful version of the Russian Saturn AL-31FN or the Chinese developed Liming WS-10A. While these could follow later, this aircraft appears to be an incremental upgrade for the J-10, which would be consistent with previous Chinese practice for indigenously designed combat aircraft. Nevertheless, these upgrades, perhaps to include a new radar, would enhance the aerial combat flexibility of the J-10, positioning it to better compete with the Shenyang J-11B for People''s Liberation Army Air Force orders. [b]It is also suggested that this J-10 is an initial development for what may become the ''FC-20'' to be purchased by Pakistan.[/b]\n\nFor some time there have been indications, mainly from Russian industry sources, that Chengdu has been developing advanced variants of the J-10. The most near-term upgrade cited by these sources would have used a thrust-vectored version of the AL-31FN to power a potential aircraft carrier variant or one better suited for high-altitude airfields near India.\n\nSource: JDW', 0, 1, '115.42.70.219', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 11233),

When a car is parked, its springs are well within ''NORMAL'' operational load position like an empty magazine. To compare it accurately, load a car so much weight that the springs are collapsed fully. Leave it for a couple of weeks and see the results for yourself.\n\nFurther I''ll refer to the air gun manufacturers'' recommendation that the gun must not be kept loaded for longer durations. For them, the longer is just few minutes not hours or weeks for that matter. Needless to say that airguns'' primary component is a spring and we are talking about firearms where these components are supportive not primary. Therefore any decrease in their strength may go unnoticed specially in pump actions.\n\nTo my understanding its the same thing as the barrel life.

"We are preparing for negotiations, which have not yet started," for four or six ships, including options, he said March 24. "We hope to close the negotiations as soon as possible. That goes for both sides."\n\n[img]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScuBrgcsNGI/AAAAAAAAA48/fO-sKBryswI/s400/U214+SSK.png[/img]\n\nFougeron gave no price details on the 6,000-metric-ton Frégate Européene Multimission (FREMM), co-developed by France and Italy. But the economic crisis has hit Greece hard, making it tougher for the government to pay for planned purchases of the new warships and combat aircraft. DCNS asked European missile maker MBDA to be part of the French warship offer, which beat proposals from other companies, including Italy''s version of the FREMM, Fougeron said. The Italian FREMM has a different combat management system, he said. MBDA has Finmeccanica of Italy as a shareholder alongside EADS and BAE Systems. DCNS has a cooperation agreement with local partner Elefsis Shipyards. DCNS last year opened an office in Athens.\n\n[img]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScuBrPA1IgI/AAAAAAAAA40/lo1ikkFJTvI/s400/MARLIN+SSK2.jpg[/img]\n\nIn January, Greek Defense Minister Vangelis Meimarakis said the authorities had authorized bilateral talks with France to buy six FREMM warships and 15 Super Puma search-and-rescue helicopters. The estimated price of a FREMM ship is about 500 million euros ($678 million). DCNS believes the Hellenic Navy''s difficulties in getting a German-built U-214 conventional submarine into service could be helpful in efforts to sell a French boat to Pakistan. Meimarakis said that Greece is trying to renegotiate a contract for a German-built conventional submarine because of technical problems, Reuters reported Jan. 22. The German four-submarine contract is reported to be worth about four billion euros, with three other 214 boats under contract. The difficulties of the Greek submarine, the Papanikolis, has probably led Pakistan to reconsider a planned buy of the 214 from Howaldstwerke Deutsche-Werft (HDW), leaving the door open to DCNS'' Marlin, an all-French derivative of the Franco-Spanish Scorpene. HDW is part of Germany''s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.\n\n[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScuBq6NNxEI/AAAAAAAAA4s/VKmPkwJ_ARY/s400/MARLIN+SSK.jpg[/img]\n\n"We are in the game in Pakistan," Fougeron said. The last of three Agosta 90 submarines built for Pakistan''s Navy took to the sea in September, equipped with the Mesma air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, Fougeron said. The AIP system, which allows the submarine to operate for longer periods underwater, has been used heavily and is working well, he said.

The cabinet’s defence committee, headed by Gilani, discussed various dimensions of national defence and security, and also reviewed the AFDP 2025 in detail. The AFDP, started in 2004-05, was initially estimated at $15 billion and expected to be completed by 20014-15, but it was later enhanced to 2024-25 with a total outlay of $28 billion, the sources said.\n\n\nThe government is allocating over a $1 billion annually to cater to the country’s defence needs, which include acquisition of latest weapons, aircraft and enhancing the country’s weapons manufacturing capability. Despite the ongoing financial crunch, the government has met the AFDP’s requirements in the current fiscal year. The sources said when the budget 2008-09 was announced, allocations for salaries were not met completely, as there had remained a shortfall of a few billion rupees.\n\n\nTo meet the financing shortfall, an additional allocation of Rs 10 billion was approved for the three forces. With the addition, the total outlay of the defence budget has increased from Rs 295 billion to Rs 305 billion for 2008-09, the sources added. The ministers of defence, foreign affairs and information, and the advisers on finance and interior were present in the meeting along with the chiefs of the country’s armed forces.\n\n\nUnder the development plan, Pakistan would purchase defense and armed weapons to fill its defense need for next 16 years, sources added. Priority has been given to Pakistan air force in armed forces development plan 2025 while production of JF-17 thunder jet is being carried out under this project. Under the plan, air defense of Pakistan army would be strengthened while Cobra, Apache helicopters and state of art weapons would also be purchased from US. In order to strengthen naval defense, 3 submarines U-214 would also be purchased from Germany, sources said.\n\nJ-10, JF-17 thunder jets would be purchased from China for Pakistan air forces. Sources told Online, finance ministry has assured armed forces that it would release funds at appropriate time to ensure implementation on Armed Forces development Plan 2025.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/03/prime-minister-yousuf-raza-gilani.html[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.75.81', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 12098),

On his arrival at the Base, he was presented with a guard of honour by smartly turned out contingent of Pakistan Air Force. The New Air Chief will undertake series of visits to various PAF Bases and would unfold his vision for preparing PAF to meet the challenges of 21st century Air Operations. While referring to the incidence of 26/11, the Air Chief lauded the performance of PAF Airmen, who played a vital role in averting an imminent war. He said, “ when the Surgical Strikes threat was about to cross the threshold, I devised an Air Strategy plan and unfolded it to the then CAS and within 4 ? 5 hours the whole PAF was on Red Alert Status and present everywhere to defend and launch offensive operations.”\n\nWhile talking to the pilots, the Air Chief said, “you are cutting edge of PAF and Nation pins high hopes on you to defend, deliver and sacrifice and keep up the glorious traditions of PAF air warriors.” He emphasized upon them to maintain the highest level of standards pertaining to various aspects of Air Operations. Addressing a joint session of Airmen, the Air Chief said “the cardinal points of my vision are Integrity, Professional Excellence and Teamwork. The top most priority will remain operational preparedness of PAF. Today, the PAF is passing through transit phase, we will be handling and operating old and new weapon systems of various capabilities, you are required to maintain these assets for their optimum performance.\nThe induction of new systems programme is on track. These systems will be requiring knowledge based training, thus my focus will be on modern training techniques and on flight safety. All measures and quality assurance procedures must be adopted for preserving the assets of PAF.” Earlier, on his arrival at the Base, the Air Chief was received by Air Vice Marshal Attique Rafique, Air Officer Commanding, Central Air Command, Pakistan Air Force and Air Commodore M Ashfaque Arain, Base Commander PAF Base, Mushaf.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/03/pafs-effective-strategy-by-paf-averted.html[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.235.166', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 12154),

This would include older models like the AL-1 through AL-3 and the 300 series (300-303), and current models 390 and 3901. This article does not apply at all to the Beretta gas-operated guns that have the recoil spring in the forearm (older Lark series and the current Xtrema) nor to Beretta''s recoil-operated shotguns (ES100 Pintail or Victoria). \n\n\nParts diagrams and owner''s manuals: I will refer to the parts by Beretta''s names for them (except where their names are counterintuitive) and will list the part numbers from Beretta''s 391 parts diagram, which is available here: \n[url]http://www.berettaservices.com/Moduli/C[/url] ... eal391.pdf \n\nThe parts diagram for the 390 is also available, but I will not use the 390 part names or numbers. [url]http://www.berettaservices.com/Moduli/C[/url] ... eal390.pdf \n\nOwner''s manuals are available here: \n[url]http://www.berettaservices.com/index.aspx?m=53&did=652[/url] \n\nDisclaimer: Beretta says some of the things discussed here should be done by a gunsmith, but I don’t know anybody who pays attention to that. If you get your gun apart and lose some parts or can’t get it back together, don’t blame me. It ain''t my fault, I just do what the voices tell me to. \n\n[b]Removing the barrel: [/b]\n \nCock the gun and leave the bolt open. Unscrew the forend nut (Beretta''s name for it is forend cap part 55), pull the forearm off, and pull the barrel off. The piston (part 48 ) normally remains on the magazine cap shaft (part 45), but if the gun is dirty it may stick inside the gas cylinder on the barrel. To store the gun with the barrel off, put the forearm back on, insert the red plastic bushing that came with the gun, and screw the forend nut on. The plastic bushing is not used when the barrel is on, but it is needed to keep the forend nut from jamming when the barrel is off. Caution: do not let the bolt slam shut with the barrel off, as it may cause the piston to damage the forearm or stick inside the forearm. If you want to store the gun with the bolt closed, hold the cocking handle and ease it shut. \n\nCaution: When you put the forearm on, make sure the U-shaped projection of wood at the base of the forearm goes into the recess on the front of the receiver. You should not see any gap between the forearm and the receiver. If you don’t get that projection seated properly, you could damage the forearm. \n\nEven if the gun is stored with the barrel on, the forend nut should be removed often, cleaned, and greased (I recommend Anti-seize, but any lubricant is better than none) to keep it from rusting and freezing in place. \n\nRemoving the bolt assembly: The bolt can be removed with the trigger group either in or out, but you might as well go on and take the trigger out (instructions below). It is a lot easier to get the bolt back in if the trigger group is out - with the trigger in, it can be hard to get the connecting rod into the recoil spring guide. If the trigger group is in, the hammer has to be cocked or the connecting rod won''t come out or go back in. That is one of the reasons you should make sure the gun is cocked and put the safety on before you start to remove either the bolt or the trigger group. (The safety has been removed from the gun illustrated, because it is dedicated to clay shooting only). \n\nRemove the forearm and barrel, and slide the piston off the magazine cap shaft. While holding on to either the cocking lever or the sleeve around the magazine (part of the operating rod part 47), press the bolt release button (Beretta calls it the cartridge latch part 35) and ease the bolt and operating rod forward. Caution: do not let the bolt slam forward when the barrel is off. Remove the cocking handle (part 72) by pulling it straight out. This may be hard to do on a new gun, but gets easier after it has been done a few times. If necessary, pull with pliers padded to prevent damage, or tie a strong cord to it and jerk. There is nothing holding it in but a spring-loaded ball that fits in a shallow groove on the side of the lever. Pull the sleeve part of the operating rod forward, and the bolt will come out of the receiver. It will not come out if the hammer is in the "fired" position. \n\n \nThe bolt is in two parts: The chrome part is the breech bolt (part 63), while the black part is the breech bolt slide (part 57). Caution: when the two parts of the bolt are separated, the pin that holds the connecting rod (part 58 ) to the slide can fall out and get lost. \n\nCaution: If you separate the connecting rod from the slide, make sure you turn it the right way when you put it back on. It should be turned so it is (as a mathematician would say) “concave up”: in other words, the cross-section of the rod should look like this \\_/, not like this /``\\ . \n\nTo put the bolt back in, put the breech bolt and slide together, hold them in place in front of the receiver on top of the magazine tube, drop the connecting rod down in the receiver, and just barely start the end of the bolt into the receiver. Put the operating rod on the magazine tube and hook the end of the operating rod into the side of the slide. Now slide the whole works down into the receiver. Make sure the end of the connecting rod goes into the cup on the end of the recoil spring guide (part 12 ). You should now be able to work the bolt up and down, compressing the recoil spring, by holding onto the operating rod. Once the bolt is in, stick the cocking handle back in. \n\nSometimes the bolt will seem to go in OK but it won''t slide back all the way. If that happens, make sure the end of the connecting rod is in the cup on the recoil spring guide. If it is, make sure the connecting rod isn''t installed upside-down (see the "caution" paragraph above). If that is OK, the bolt probably went into the receiver cocked a little bit to one side. Take the bolt out and start over, making sure the bolt goes in straight. It might help to turn the bolt a little bit clockwise as seen from the front as it goes in. \n\n[b]Replacing the firing pin or its spring: [/b]\n \nTo remove the firing pin and spring, the “firing pin retaining pin” (part 67) must be driven out from the bottom - it cannot be driven from the top. Note that the retaining pin is staked in place - that means the top of the bolt beside the retaining pin hole has been struck with a punch to deform the metal and lock the pin in place. I’ve only removed one retaining pin, and I was able to drive it out with no trouble, but if it is staked very securely you might need to use a Dremel tool to clear off the deformed metal. I think it would be best not to remove that burr if you don’t have to - in my case, I was able to get the retaining pin out and back in (twice) and there is still enough of a burr to help hold it in place. \n\nWith the retaining pin out, the firing pin and spring just slide right out. \n\nRemoving the trigger group: This is hard to do the first time, but gets a lot easier after it has been done a few times. \n\n \nYou can remove the trigger group with the bolt in or out, but it is easier to get the bolt back in if the trigger group is already out. \n\nPut the safety on. Drive out the “trigger plate retaining pin” (part 30). This is the pin that goes through both sides of the receiver, above the front end of the trigger guard. Pull the trigger group forward a fraction of an inch - you will see a small gap open up between the back end of the “trigger plate” (part 73) and the bottom of the receiver. When new, you might have to hit it with the heel of your palm to get it to move. From this point with a new gun, it will help to get someone to hold the gun down while you pull the trigger group out. Press the bolt release button while pulling the trigger group forward and down. Putting the trigger group back in is just the reverse - remember to press the bolt release button while you put it in. After it has been out a few times, the trigger group will loosen up and it will go in and out easily. \n\nCaution: The hammer should remain cocked while the trigger group is out of the gun. There are two pins that get loose and can fall out while the hammer is in the "fired" position. These are the trigger pin (part 84) and the carrier catch plunger pin (part 96). \n\n[b]Ambidextrous safety: [/b]\n \nThe safety comes from the factory set for a right-handed shooter, but it can easily be changed for a left-handed shooter, or removed completely. \n\nThe safety button is held in place by a plunger and spring on the right side. To remove it, use a thin blade or similar tool to press the plunger in and push the button out to the left side of the trigger group. Be careful not to let the plunger and spring fly out and get lost (although the plunger often hangs up and has to be pried out if the safety is not going to be put back in.) To reverse the safety for a left-hander, just turn the button end-for-end and put it back in. \n\nIt is common for clay shooters to remove the safeties from guns that are dedicated to clay shooting only. I do that, but I do not recommend it for a gun that will be used for any purpose other than clay shooting. \n\n[b]Magazine Parts and Plug: [/b]\n \nThe magazine tube cap (Part 45, including the shaft that the piston and forend nut fit on) screws into the end of the magazine tube (part 44). There is a tiny plunger through the side of the tube to keep the cap from coming loose. Depress that plunger with a point of some kind, and unscrew the cap. If necessary, a screwdriver can be used in the end of the cap shaft. Caution: If you are not careful the magazine spring (part 42) will fly out when the cap comes off. With the spring out, you can turn the gun up and let the follower (part 41) fall out. \n\nThe magazine plug (part 43) is an aluminum rod with a head like a nail, which extends through the shaft of the magazine cap and into the magazine. It is held in place by a spring clip (magazine reducer plug retaining washer, part 46). To remove or replace the plug, pull the clip off and throw it away. Yes, I said throw it away. I didn''t make that up, one of the FAQ''s on the Beretta USA web site says throw it away - it serves no useful purpose. I guess the clip is on there to keep a new owner from thinking he got a broken gun if he turns the gun down with the forend nut off, and the plug falls out. With the clip off, just remove the forend nut to remove or replace the plug. All 391''s sold in the US (as far as I know) come with a plug installed to limit shell capacity to 1 in the chamber and 2 in the magazine, with a longer plug in the box to limit capacity to 1 and 1. With no plug, capacity is 1 and 3. \n\n[b]Removing the stock, and using stock shims:[/b] \nFirst remove the recoil pad. Depending on what kind of recoil pad you have, there might be a quick-release device or two Phillips-head wood screws. If you can’t see the screw heads, look for two tiny holes in the rubber, oil the point of the screwdriver and press it into the holes, expanding them. If there are no holes, there may be two circles about 1/4” diameter - these are rubber plugs which can be pulled out with thin-nosed pliers. \n\nThe nut which holds the stock in place takes a 13mm socket, but I have been told that a 1/2” socket is close enough to work OK. (Some older models of Beretta’s gas-operated guns might take a 19mm socket.) Getting the stock off is self-evident, but it can be tricky to get it back on. I have found that a magnet shaped like a pencil helps a lot in putting the rear plate and lock washer in place while the gun is held vertical, butt up. Then put the nut in the socket and turn the gun partly over on its side so you can get the socket inside without the nut falling out. \n\nWhat we commonly call “stock shims” consist of a front spacer (part 10) and a plate (part 15) which come in matched pairs. They can be turned different ways to produce cast off (marked DX) or cast on (marked SX) and any of several amounts of drop (marked in millimeters). Caution: It is very important that both be turned the same way. For example, if the spacer is placed on the rear of the receiver so the figures “C-60-DX” (60mm drop, cast off) are showing before the stock goes on , then the plate must be installed with the same figures showing. Mixing them can cause the stock to split due to uneven stress. \n\n[b]Replacing the recoil spring: [/b]\n \nThe recoil spring needs to be replaced periodically, because it weakens with use. Some people advise replacing it every 5,000 shots, some say 10,000. A weak spring will allow the bolt to come back too fast when the shot is fired, which over along time period can result in damage to the bolt and the receiver. The old spring will be shorter than the new one - sometimes there is a bigger difference than shown in the illustration. Replacing the recoil spring may not be as important if you only use light target ammo as it would be with heavy field loads, but it is cheap insurance anyway. The 12 gauge 391 (but not the 20 gauge) has an additional recoil absorber (part 120) in the rear of the receiver to act as a buffer. \n\nThe spring and its tube may need cleaning once in a while if you are using very dirty ammo that leaves a lot of ash. \n\nThe recoil spring cap (part 14) screws into the rear of the stock bolt tube (part 11) and there are flats on the sides for a wrench. The cap is usually fastened in place at the factory by use of a thread locker (Loctite or equivalent). That is not always true, as I had one that came from the factory with no thread locker, but most of them are locked. The cap must be heated to release the thread locker. Most people use a small propane torch, but if you don''t have one you can do it by sticking the cap through the cracked-open door of a kitchen oven preheated to around 450-500 deg. Try the wrench every 30 seconds to a minute, and the cap will come out in just a few minutes. \n\nCaution: the recoil spring is compressed and will fly out violently if not restrained. Before you get the cap completely off, stick a stiff wire or a thin nail through the holes in both sides of the tube, to hold the spring in. With the cap off, hold a rag over the end of the spring, pull the nail out, and let the spring come out gently. The spring will probably be dirty and greasy. The recoil spring guide (part 12) will slide out, but you might need to start it by pressing with a fingertip from inside the receiver. Some of the guides are longer than the one illustrated - a design change, apparently. Clean and lightly lubricate the tube. \n\nThe easiest way I have found to compress the new spring enough to get it in is to put the guide and spring in the tube, stick a thin Phillips screwdriver in the spring and push down as far as possible, then stick the nail in to hold the spring until the cap is screwed in. Both the screwdriver and the nail must be thin so the screwdriver won''t keep the nail from going in. \n\nSo, do you put Loctite on the cap when you put it back in? As far as I''m concerned, that is an open question. I don''t, and I don''t think most shooters do, but I had a cap come loose one time, letting the stock get loose. I probably just didn''t tighten it enough. I still don''t use Loctite but I pay more attention to tightening the cap. If I were shooting a very important tournament or going on the hunt of a lifetime with no backup gun, I would use Loctite, but since I switched from an O/U to an automatic I have learned from experience to carry a backup in those situations. \n\n[b]Forend nut: [/b]\n \n\nThe 391 forend nut (Beretta calls it fore-end cap, part 55) is the most ridiculously over-engineered mechanism I have ever seen. It consists of 7 parts, only 6 of which show on Beretta’s parts diagram. The parts in the illustration will go back into the nut in clockwise order: the plastic bushing first, then the washer, etc, and finishing with the lock ring (snap ring). The thin ring in the 4 o''clock position in the illustration is the part that does not show on the parts diagram. \n\nOlder forend nuts do not have the mysterious ring, confirming that it was part of a design change, and that is why it does not show up on the parts diagram. The moving part, which I call the "plunger" for lack of another name, is bigger in diameter so it fits close in the nut without a ring. I prefer that design, because the metal washer and plastic buffer are easier to get out for cleaning. I would guess that Beretta added the ring because the outer part of the nut rusts, which could cause the plunger to bind. The ring looks like stainless. I still think the old design is better, provided you don''t neglect the nut until it rusts. So why didn''t Beretta switch to a rust-resistant steel for the outer part of the nut and leave the ring out? That would have solved several problems. Beretta works in mysterious ways..... \n\nThe most important part of the nut to clean is the threads. If they are not kept clean and lubricated, they will rust and freeze onto the magazine tube cap. Removing a badly rusted nut is a major project, and preventing that is worth some effort. Fortunately, that can be done without disassembling the nut. Just remove it from the magazine cap often, flush the threads out with a solvent (Gunscrubber, brake parts cleaner, Breakfree CLP, etc) and lubricate it. I generally use a few drops of Breakfree CLP or RemOil inside the threads, but to be extra careful I apply Permatex Anti-Seize or Rig Universal grease to the threads on the magazine cap. \n\nDisassembly of the nut for a detailed cleaning is something that does not need to be done real often. In fact, if you only use your gun for hunting, and you use fairly clean-burning shells, you might get away with never disassembling it. However, if you shoot a lot and use dirty shells it will fill up with crud and stop working eventually if you don''t clean it. \n\nTo see if the nut is still working properly, place it on a hard surface like a table top, with the spring-loaded part (I will call it the plunger for lack of a better name) down, and press on the top of the nut with the heel of your hand. You should be able to feel the plunger moving on its spring. If not, you''ve got trouble, and you should have cleaned it long ago! \n\nThe first step in disassembly is removing the snap ring, and to do this you need a pair of snap ring pliers. You need to squeeze the nut to depress the plunger and take the pressure off the snap ring to make it easier to get the ring out. I have used a small vise, and a friend of mine uses a drill press, but I generally use a small pair of tongue and groove pliers (commonly called Channellocks). \n\nOnce you get the snap ring out, the plunger and spring come right out. You could just stop there and clean what you can see: in fact, some people may not even realize that the other parts are in there. To take everything out, you first have to remove the mysterious "phantom" ring that does not appear on the diagrams. Use a dentist''s pick or something similar to hook under the bottom edge of the ring, pull up a little, and work your way around pulling up just a tiny bit each time. Once you work the ring part way up, you can grab it with thin-nosed pliers and pull it on out. With the ring out, the metal washer and plastic bushing will come out if you turn the nut face down and bang it on the workbench. However, if you let the nut get real dirty before you try to clean it you may never be able to get the ring, metal washer and plastic bushing out. No matter, you can clean it pretty well with those parts still in. \n\nGetting the snap ring out and back in can be a problem. If you clean your nut often you might consider replacing the snap ring with one that does not fit quite so tight. I went to a well-stocked hardware store and asked for a snap ring to match the original, and what I got looked like the same size, but turned out to be a tad bit smaller. I suspect the original is a metric size and the replacement is an SAE size. It goes in and out a lot easier, and it holds everything in just fine. When the nut is on the gun, there is no pressure on the ring anyway, it only serves its purpose when the nut is off. \n\nThis over-engineered forend nut can be simplified and made easier to clean by removing all the internal parts and replacing them with a single spring, so the nut functions very much like the one on a Beretta 390. For more information, see: \n\n[b]Cleaning the gas ports:[/b] The gas ports are two holes in the bottom of the barrel that feed gas from inside the barrel into the gas cylinder which is welded to the bottom of the barrel. If the ports get clogged, the gun will not cycle properly. The first sign of clogged ports is weak ejection - the empty hulls will land closer to the shooter''s feet, and eventually will fail to get all the way out of the receiver. How often they need cleaning depends on how clean-burning your ammo is. They will go at least 10 times as long between cleanings with clean ammo like Rio than with dirty ammo like Federal Top Gun. Some people say they never have to clean the ports, but I had trouble when I didn''t, so it is just something you have to learn from experience. \n\n \n\nTo clean the ports, one must first disassemble the gas valve. New 391''s come with a pair of "valve hook wrenches" (part 118) to loosen the valve counter nut (part 116) and remove the valve nut (part 115). They are hard to use because the counter nut is put on very tight at the factory, and the valve nut has a long threaded portion, requiring that it be turned a lot with the wrench. Several after-market suppliers make socket wrenches that are easier to use. Beretta advises against using the after-market wrenches, because they work too well. Beretta apparently is afraid you are going to tighten the nuts so tight you damage something. I understand their point, but I have a higher regard for your intelligence than Beretta does. \n\nUse the two hook wrenches together as illustrated to break the counter nut loose. It will be easier after the first time, because you probably won''t get it back on as tight as the factory did. Next remove the valve nut and the valve, valve centering ring, and valve spring (parts 113, 114, and 117 respectively). The valve shaft (part 112) will then come out of the other end of the gas cylinder. \n\n \n\nThe gas ports can then be cleaned by sticking any suitable probe through the hole in the underside of the gas cylinder, going all the way through the cylinder and into the ports in the barrel. If the deposits are soft, a pipe cleaner may be enough, but I have seen some deposits that were much harder - it depends on the ammo you use. It may also depend on whether you keep the area "wet" with a solvent like Breakfree CLP. I like to clean the ports of a 12 gauge gun with a 1/8" drill bit held by hand, or in a small pair of vise grip pliers, or in a pin vise. A 1/8" bit is smaller than the ports (so it won''t cut the metal), but close enough to keep the port diameter from narrowing down much due to deposits. When I did the cleaning with a thinner wire I had trouble with failures to eject, because the ports were open to some extent, but too narrow. Caution: The suggestion of a 1/8" drill bit for cleaning the ports is only for a 12 gauge gun. That might be too big for a 20 gauge gun. \n\nThere are also 4 ports on the front of the gas cylinder, covered up by the valve when it is assembled. For lack of a better name, I''ll call them valve ports. These may also plug up when you use dirty ammo, and they need to be open for the valve to function properly. The valve is what makes the whole system self-adjusting (within limits) for light and heavy loads. \n\nWhen the valve is reassembled, the valve shaft should be turned the way it is in the illustration - with the longer side toward the barrel where it will protect the magazine cap shaft from the hot gas coming through the ports. The gun seems to work just fine with the valve shaft turned the wrong direction, but I suspect the shaft on the magazine cap will get dirtier faster that way. \n\nThe valve does not need any adjustment - just tighten the valve nut all the way down, then tighten the counter nut. \n\nReplacing the Carrier: Some 391 owners have had to replace their carriers, because the factory turns out one every now and then that is twisted, and causes a characteristic type of failure to feed (FTF). The front end of the second shell will hang up on the right edge of the chamber, and not enter the chamber at all. \n\nSome people say their carriers are twisted so badly you can easily see it, but mine had such a little twist in it that I still can''t see anything wrong with it. However, I did find a way to detect the twist. I lay the carrier on a smooth table top, hold it down with a fingertip, and wiggle it side-to-side. My original twisted one wobbles like a table with one leg shorter than the other 3 legs. Most replacement carriers do not wobble at all - all 4 "legs" contact the table top together, although I have seen one good carrier that would wobble just a tiny bit. If you are having failures to feed, you might be able to use this technique to test your carrier to see if it is twisted. But of course, all the wobbling in the world won''t matter if you don''t have failures to feed. The image below illustrates the technique: \n\n \n\nThe carrier lever (with its spring and plunger) is riveted to the carrier. If you have to buy a new carrier, you might want to get one with the lever already attached. Or, if you feel comfortable about removing and re-installing the rivet, just get a new rivet with the carrier and do it yourself. \n\nTo remove the carrier, just drive out the carrier pin, and make sure the small parts (two round swivel joints, spring and spring guide) don''t get lost when it all comes apart. \n\nFor instructions on how to reinstall the carrier, see section F below in "Reassembly of the trigger group". \n\n \n\n[b]Disassembly of the trigger group:[/b] It is never necessary to disassemble the trigger group for cleaning: just flush it out with a solvent and spray it with oil or CLP. Once in a while it becomes necessary to take the trigger group apart to replace a part (usually a hammer brace or hammer bush). The group looks complicated, but it really isn''t difficult to get it apart and back together. If you want to do a complete disassembly, I would suggest doing it in the following order: \n\n[b]Step1:[/b] Remove the carrier catch plunger with its pin and spring. The only reason for doing this first is it will probably fall out anyway, so you might as well get it over with. The pin is held in position by spring pressure as long as the button is out, but it will get loose if: \na: you press the button in and let the carrier drop down, holding the button in, or \nb: you pull the trigger and let the hammer go up to its "fired" position. \nDo either of those things, let the pin fall out or push it out with a punch, and the plunger and spring will come out. \n\nBe careful not let the pin fall out and get lost while cleaning the trigger group. (I was lucky, and found mine on the floor.) \n\n[b]Step 2:[/b] Remove the carrier. Just drive out the carrier pin, and make sure the small parts (two round swivel joints, spring and spring guide) don''t get lost when it all comes apart. \n\n[b]Step 3:[/b] Remove the hammer spring. (If you ever have to replace the hammer spring, you can do it without going through steps 1 and 2 first.) While holding the hammer down, pull the trigger then let the hammer rise to the ''''fired" position to relieve pressure on the hammer spring. At this point, the trigger pin is likely to fall out, but that is OK, just don''t let it get lost. Drive out the roll pin (Beretta calls it "hammer spring guide spring pin"), and the Hammer Spring Guide, Spring, and Plunger will come right out. Driving the pin out and putting it back in will be easier if you press in on the guide to take spring pressure off the pin. \n\n[b]Step 4[/b]: Drive out the hammer bush (note - it must come out on the left side, it cannot come out to the right). Once the hammer bush is out, the hammer, hammer braces, and trigger come right out. \n\nOne note about the hammer bush and its "hammer bush retaining spring ring" as Beretta calls it - most people call it a "circlip". It is a tiny piece of spring wire bent into a circle, and it goes around the hammer bush, clipping into a slot in the bush to hold it in place. The function of the circlip is to hold the trigger group pin (trigger plate retaining pin) in place by clipping into one of the two grooves in the pin (the pin actually goes through the bush). Once in a while the bush will break at the slot, allowing the circlip to come off. The pin will then fall out, and the trigger group will move, resulting in malfunctions. \n\nNote that the hammer braces are not alike - they are a mirror-image pair, left and right. They come together at the rear (smaller) end, and stand apart at the front end, one on each side of the hammer. The holes on the front ends of the braces fit over studs on the sides of the hammer. \n\n[b]Step 5[/b]. Remove small parts from the trigger. I have never removed the Trigger Spring and its Guide Plunger, because as far as I can tell the end of the plunger needs to be swaged like a rivet, and if you ever have to take it out you probably should put a new one in. To remove the sear, just drive out the trigger bush, and be careful not to lose the sear plunger and spring as the sear comes out. \n\n\nReassembly of the trigger group: You may have your favorite way of putting the trigger group back together, but this sequence works for me: \n\nA. Put the Sear Spring and Plunger in their hole in the trigger, put the Sear in place so it holds the Sear Spring Plunger in place, and insert the Trigger Bush. \n\nB. Put the trigger and trigger pin in the Trigger Plate. The Trigger Pin will probably be a little loose, so you have to hold it to keep it from falling out. \n\nC. Put the holes in the hammer braces over the studs on the sides of the hammer, and hold it all together while you put the small ends of the braces (they should be together) into the hole where the hammer spring guide plunger will go later. \n\nD. Put the base of the hammer near its final position at the front end of the trigger plate and move the other end down to the sear, so the hammer is in the cocked position. Put the hammer bush in place (from the left). \n\nE. Pull the trigger and lift the hammer to the "fired" position, put the hammer spring guide plunger, spring, and guide into the hole in the rear end of the trigger plate. Press the guide in to compress the spring while gently tapping the roll pin in to keep everything in place. Cock the hammer after you get the spring installed to put spring pressure on the trigger pin to keep it from falling back out. \n\nF. Put the carrier on. There may be several ways to do it, but the way that works for me is to put the carrier close to its final position on the trigger plate, then get the swivel joints, spring, and spring guide in place before I insert the pin. Handling all those little pieces might be awkward at first, but be patient and it will all go together eventually. You can''t get the swivel joints backwards, because only one of them will go in the carrier. Make sure you put the short end of the spring guide in the carrier swivel joint, because if you put the guide in backward the carrier won''t work right. Don''t ask me how I know that, just take my word for it.  \n\nG. Install the carrier catch plunger spring, plunger, and pin, leaving the plunger out when you finish so the pin won''t fall out.', 0, 1, '203.81.231.160', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 650, 12218),

The Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) had, at first, explored the possibility of such a plan and, later, put together operational plans for a possible air strike against Kahuta in the 1980s using satellite photo and intelligence information provided by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These operational plans are still kept updated in the Headquarters of the IDF/AF and pilots of some specially assigned IDF/AF F-16 and F-15 squadrons are given special training exercises to carry out mock attacks on Kahuta. So much so that a full-scale mock-up of the Kahuta facility was built in the southern Negev Desert for the IDF/AF pilots to train on.\n\nThe Kahuta plan was made concurrently with the plan to attack Osirak using the same pilots of the Iraq mission, if it went through successfully. The Israelis planned to either use Indian airbases or fly non-stop from Israel to Kahuta while refuelling their aircraft using airborne tankers. Israeli Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft would jam Pakistani air defence radar while the Israelis took out Kahuta - or at least attempted to do so.\n\nTo this effect, India had played its part in cajoling and trying to convince Israel to carry this ill-advised plan through. However, Israel was insisting on using Indian air bases but India was reluctant to allow them such a facility for fear of sparking of another Indo-Pak war. According to a paper published by the Australian Institute for National Strategic Studies, “Israeli interest in destroying Pakistan’s Kahuta reactor to scuttle the "Islamic bomb" was blocked by India''s refusal to grant landing and refueling rights to Israeli warplanes in 1982.” India wanted to see Kahuta gone but did not want to face the blame or the retaliation nor bear any responsibility. Israel, on its part wanted it to be seen as a joint Indo-Israeli strike so that responsibility could be shared. The Reagan Administration was against this plan, not out of any love for Pakistan’s nuclear programme, but because at that time it was busy fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and considered Pakistan a key ally in the conflict. It informed Israel and India that it could not support such a plan. This plan, therefore, never materialized and was indefinitely postponed, and rightly so, after Pakistan reminded the Israelis that they were not the Iraqis and the Pakistan Air Force was not the Iraqi Air Force. Through indirect channels, Pakistan had also conveyed the message to Israel, if Kahuta was attacked, Pakistan would lay waste to Dimona, Israel’s nuclear reactor in the Negev Desert.\n\nPakistan, however, was not taking any chances. Soon after the Osirak raid in 1981, then President Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan directed PAF Air Headquarters (AHQ) to make contingency plans for a possible Israeli attack on Kahuta. In lieu thereof, the PAF Chief of Air Staff issued an Air Tasking Order to the Air Officer Commanding of the Air Defence Command to take suitable measures for the air defence of Kahuta and prepare a contingency plan for a retaliatory PAF strike on Dimona, in case Kahuta was attacked. As a follow-up to this directive, a special Operations Room was established at AHQ, Chaklala to oversee the task of defending Pakistan’s strategic nuclear facilities at Kahuta and Karachi. A study of the air defence ground environment of Kahuta was carried out and gaps and weaknesses in the air defences were filled and strengthened. On 10 July 1982, a special contingency plan was issued. In the event of an Israeli attack on Pakistan''s strategic installations, plans were drawn up for a retaliatory Pakistani strike on Dimona. The strike would be carried out by Mirage III/Vs. When Pakistan received 40 General Dynamics Block F-16A/Bs from the US from 15 January 1983 onwards, this new weapons system too was incorporated in Pakistan’s contingency plan to carry out retaliatory strikes on Dimona.\n\nIn the backdrop of the above scenario, it was, therefore, not surprising that in the aftermath of the Indian nuclear tests of 13 May 1998, Pakistan felt that there was a strong possibility of a joint Indo-Israeli strike against Pakistan''s nuclear installations. The PAF had an essential role to play in defending Pakistan''s strategic installations and airspace to thwart any such plan. The tensions were so high that a PAF F-16 flying low over the Ras Koh test site in the Chagai District of Balochistan on the eve of the Pakistani nuclear tests was, for a moment, mistaken by the personnel on the ground, to be an Israeli warplane. The incident sparked off a diplomatic squabble between Pakistan and Israel, with the Israeli Ambassador in Washington D.C. denying the existence of any such plan.\n\nThen Pakistan''s Ambassador to the United Nations, Ahmed Kamal told CNN that Pakistan had reliable information about Indian intentions to launch air strikes against Pakistan''s nuclear test facilities. Kamal told CNN that if India strikes, Pakistan''s response would be "massive" and would "bode ill for peace."\n\n"We''re involved in this threat and in making sure that it does not arise because if it does, the world must understand that Pakistan is ready, that it will react, that the reaction will be massive and dissuasive, and that it would lead us into a situation which would bode ill for peace and security, not only in the region, but beyond," Kamal said.\n\nAs soon as the decision to conduct the nuclear tests had been taken, the PAF was ordered to assume air defence duties over Chagai and the strategic nuclear installations of Pakistan, including Kahuta, Nilore, Fatehjung, Chashma, Khushab and Karachi.\n\nOperation Bedaar ’98: PAF Squadron Roles during Chagai\n\nThe PAF operations for the defence of Pakistan’s strategic nuclear installations during the May 1998 nuclear tests were codenamed “Operation Bedaar ’98” by the PAF.\n\nThis was a unique operation in which all four PAF command sector Headquarters (HQ) were involved, namely:\n\n(a) HQ NORSEC (Northern Sector) based at PAF Chaklala (Rawalpindi, Punjab) and falling under the control of the Northern Air Command (NAC) at Peshawar;\n\n(b) HQ CENSEC (Central Sector) under the Central Air Command (CAC) and both based at PAF Sargodha (Punjab);\n\n© HQ WESSEC (Western Sector) based at PAF Base Samungli (Quetta, Balochistan) also falling under the command of CAC; and\n\n(d) HQ SOUSEC (Southern Sector) based at PAF Faisal (Karachi, Sindh) and falling under the control of the Southern Air Command (SAC), also based at Karachi.\n\nNo. 6 Air Transport Squadron (ATS) Squadron, equipped with C-130 “Hercules” medium-lift tactical transport aircraft and based at PAF Base Chaklala, commanded by Group Captain Sarfraz Ahmad Khan, extended the necessary logistical support to the rest of the PAF squadrons that were being redeployed for air defence alert (ADA) duties. The Squadron carried a total of 12,66,615 lbs. loads in 71 separate sorties during the nuclear tests.\n\nNo. 7 Tactical Attack (TA) Squadron, equipped with ex-Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Mirage III EAs having recently undergone Retrofit of Strike Element (ROSE I) upgrades at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC), Kamra and based at PAF Base Masroor (Karachi, Sindh), commanded by Wg. Cdr. Shahid Mahmood were moved to PAF Base Shabaz (Jacobabad, Balochistan) for day-night ADA duties. This squadron is now due to be transformed into a multi-role squadron following the ROSE upgrades and after being equipped with new radar.\n\nThe PAF’s elite No. 9 Multi-Role (MR) Squadron “Griffins” (falling under No. 34 Wing led by Grp. Capt. Shahid Shigri), equipped with F-16As, commanded by Wg. Cdr. Azher Hasan, was deployed at PAF Samungli (Quetta, Balochistan) on 27 May 1998 to provide night-time air defence cover to the nuclear test sites at Ras Koh and Kharan.\n\nNo. 11 MR Squadron "Arrows" (No. 34 Wing), equipped with F-16A/Bs commanded by Gp. Capt. Akhtar H. Bukhari was moved to PAF Shabaz for day-night ADA duties on 24 May 1998.\n\nNo. 14 MR Squadron “The Tail Choppers”, equipped with F-7P aircraft and based at PAF Sargodha, commanded by Wg. Cdr. M. Jamshaid Khan, was deployed at PAF Base Chaklala for the point defence of KRL, Kahuta; PINSTECH, Nilore and NDC, Fatehjung.\n\nNo. 17 Air Superiority (AS) Squadron "Tigers" (falling under No. 31 Wing led by Grp. Capt. Rashid Hasan Bukhari), then equipped with F-6 aircraft and commanded by Wg. Cdr. Muhammad Jamil Memon carried out standing day-time Combat Air Patrol (CAP) missions from its parent base, PAF Base Samungli and its Forward Operational Bases (FOBs), PAF Bases Shahbaz and Sukker (Sindh) respectively. No. 17 Squadron was re-quipped with F-7PG aircraft from China on 27 March 2002.\n\nNo. 23 Squadron "Talons" (No. 31 Wing), then equipped with F-6 aircraft and based at PAF Base Samungli, commanded by Wg. Cdr. Ghulam Mustafa Abbasi was deployed at PAF Base Sukker for about a week for day-time ADA duties. Members of the Squadron who participated in the ADA duties included Wg. Cdr. Irfan Idrees, Sqn. Ldr. Khan Maqbool, Flt. Lt. Anwer Karim, Flt. Lt. S. Atta, Flt. Lt. Waqas Moshin, Flt. Lt. Zeeshan Saeed, Flt. Lt. Aamir Shaukat, Flt. Lt. Ali Asher, Flt. Lt. Nadeem Afzal and Flt. Lt. Nasir Jamal. No. 23 Squadron is also scheduled to be re-quipped with F-7PG aircraft from China later this year.\n\nAt PAF Base Samungli, F-6 aircraft belonging to the re-equipped No. 25 MR Squadron (now a SAGEM-upgraded Mirage V EF (ROSE II) squadron) and which were being kept in reduced flying status (hot storage) by the Field Maintenance Unit (FMU) at the Base were also activated and made operational in a day’s notice for emergency back-up if the need arose.\n\nNo. 314 Ground Combateers Wing of the PAF, located at PAF Samungli was tasked with providing enhanced ground security cover to the F-16s of Nos. 9 and 11 Squadrons deployed at the Base.\n\nNo. 481 Control & Reporting Centre (CRC) based at PAF Base, Lahore, along with seven Mobile Pulse-Doppler Radar (MPDR), was deployed at designated sites till the exercise was called off on 1 June 1998. No. 482 CRC based at PAF Base Malir (Karachi) deployed its MPDR-45 radar in the Sukker area at short notice on 21 May 1998. The radar handled a number of CAP missions that were launched to counter any aerial threat to the nuclear installations. No. 484 CRC based at PAF Chaklala remained on usual alert for the point defence of Kahuta. No. 486 CRC based at PAF Chaklala since November 1985 has been exclusive assigned to the task of defending Pakistan’s nuclear installations. It deployed its MPDR-90P radar at Pasni, Balochistan at short notice to detect any attack approaching from the sea. No. 403, a mobile Squadron based at PAF Base, Lahore and equipped with TPS-43G high altitude surveillance radar also participated in Bedaar’98. No. 408 Squadron based at PAF Malir, (near Karachi) and equipped with FPS-20A high-altitude long range static radar and TPS-43G high altitude radar successfully controlled a number of hot CAP mission and intercepted US Navy aircraft flying close to Pakistan’s 12 nautical mile wide territorial sea. Incidentally, this was the same squadron that participated in the several joint PAF/USN exercises called "Inspired Alert" between 1994 and 1997 in which the Squadron had experienced an opportunity to intercept aircraft like the F-14s and F-18s. No. 410 Squadron equipped with TPS-43G radar provided round-the-clock operations and controlled 26 high altitude CAPS during Operation Bedaar’98. No. 4091 Squadron based at Kirana Hills near Sargodha and equipped with Siemens MPDR-90 low-level static radar located at a height of 1,600 feet, provided a surveillance capability for the point defence of Sargodha Air Base and the Central Ammunition Depot (CAD) with its ability to detect aircraft flying at low level at extended ranges.\n\nNo. 541 Squadron, a mobile Surface-to-Air-Missile (SAM) squadron based at PAF Chaklala, and equipped with Crotale 2000 performed its duties for the point defence of Kahuta. No. 904 Squadron, based at Murree and equipped with MPDR-90S radar provided both independent and hooked-up mode operations with No. 486 CRC by providing early warning on low and medium level ingressing aircraft towards the national vital points from Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir. No. 451 Squadron, a mobile SAM squadron based at PAF Chaklala, and equipped with the Crotale 2000 SAM system provided air defence to the Kahuta and Nilore area. No. 454 Squadron, a mobile SAM squadron based PAF Chaklala, and equipped with the Crotale 2000 SAM system provided air defence cover to the national vital points. No. 455 Squadron, a mobile SAM squadron, deployed in the Kilo area and equipped with the Crotale 4000 SAM system provided air defence cover to the national vital points. No. 242 Squadron, a mobile SAM squadron, based at PAF Base Rafiqui, and equipped with the French Mistral SAM system provided air defence cover to PAF air bases. No.471 Squadron, a SAM squadron, based at PAF Chaklala and equipped with the Black Arrow (Chinese Red Flag II) high-altitude SAM system provided day-night air defence coverage upto 80,000 feet over the Kahuta, Nilore and Fatehjung area.\n\nIt was felt that a joint Indo-Israeli attack could target not only Pakistan''s nuclear installations but the nuclear test sites at Ras Koh and Kharan as well. According to intelligence reports, US and Indian intelligence did not know about the Kharan Desert site, which came as a total surprise to them. To counter any high-level threat emanating from the west or south-west, a TPS-43G high level radar had been permanently deployed in the Quetta area since October 1982. The same radar was, therefore, used to provide surveillance on all flying aircraft in the Chagai area.\n\nDalbandin Airfield had an important role to play during Pakistan’s May 1998 nuclear tests. In fact, two names gained prominence around the world during the tests: (i) Chagai Hills and (ii) Dalbandin airfield. Dalbandin is located among sand dunes some 30 km south-east of the Chagai Hills near the Pakistan-Afghanistan Border. The Koh Khambaran Massif in the Ras Koh Mountain Range, the site of Pakistan''s nuclear test, lies south of the Chagai Hills and Dalbandin.\n\nThe airfield at Dalbandin was constructed in 1935 to serve as a satellite for Samungli Air Base at Quetta. During the Second World War, it was made operational by the Royal Air Force in order to counter a possible Russian invasion through Iran and Afghanistan. During the 1970s, Dalbandin remained a disused airfield. Although the airstrip is visible from extremely high altitude, pilots making landing approaches often find the airstrip disappearing from view, with sand dunes and sand collected on the runway obscuring it - like a natural camouflage. Dust storms are frequent and cause delays in take-off and landing schedules. The airfield was taken over by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in 1985, it received a major face-lift and overhaul, which provided modern navigational aids, air traffic control facilities, a passenger terminal and a paved runway. There are regularly scheduled Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) services to the airport. While not a military facility, this airfield is available to the PAF for emergency landing and recovery of aircraft during peacetime and wartime. During May 1998, Dalbandin air field became the centre of activity for all personnel, military and civilian, flying to and from the nuclear tests sites to the rest of the country.\n\nThe nuclear devices were themselves flown in semi-knocked down (SKD) sub-assembly form on two flights of PAF C-130 Hercules tactical transport aircraft from PAF Chaklala in northern Punjab to Dalbandin airfield, escorted even within Pakistani airspace by four PAF F-16As armed with air-to-air missiles. At the same time, PAF F-7P air defence fighters, also armed with air-to-air missiles, were on CAP guarding the aerial frontiers of Pakistan against intruders. Both the nuclear devices (the bomb mechanism, the HMX explosive shields and casing) and the fissile material (the highly enriched uranium components) were divided into separate consignments and flown on separate flights of the Hercules. The PAEC did not want to put all its nuclear eggs in one basket in case something adverse was to happen to the aircraft. The security of the devices and the fissile material was so strict that that PAF F-16 escort pilots had been secretly given standing orders that in the unlikely event of the C-130 being hijacked or flown outside of Pakistani airspace, they were to shoot down the aircraft before it left Pakistan’s airspace. The F-16s were ordered to escort the C-130s to the Dalbandin airfield in Balochistan with their radio communications equipment turned off so that no orders, in the interim, could be conveyed to them to act otherwise. They were also ordered to ignore any orders to the contrary that got through to them during the duration of the flight even if such orders seemingly originated from Air Headquarters.\n\nOn 30 May 1998, when Pakistan sixth nuclear device shook the ground in the Kharan Desert, Operation Bedaar ''98 had accomplished its mission - that of deterring any misadventure by either India or Israel to strike at Pakistan''s nuclear infrastructure.\n\nBut how real was the possibility of a joint or unilateral Israeli or Indian raid on Pakistan''s nuclear installations during May 1998? The answer is that we really don''t know. The threat is of such a nature that it can neither be overestimated nor underestimated. Overestimation may lead to minor diplomatic embarrassment, but underestimation will surely lead to catastrophe for Pakistan. So Pakistan prefers to overestimate the threat and pay the price of minor diplomatic embarrassment rather than underestimate it and face the prospective annihilation. This is not to say that the threat was never there during May 1998. Pakistan preferred to be safe rather than sorry. Furthermore, there is concrete evidence that India and Israeli have been planning exactly such an operation to neutralize Pakistan''s nuclear capability. It is only the PAF and the risk of nuclear retaliation that is holding them back.\n\nAccording to an Indian official, Subramaniam Swamy, a former member of the Hindu fundamentalist and extremist Bharati Janata Party (BJP) that rules India today, Israel in 1982 asked him to sound out other Indian leaders to see if India would grant Israeli warplanes landing and refueling rights were they to undertake an Osirak-type raid against the Kahuta nuclear reactor in Pakistan. India refused, probably for a combination of reasons. As one expert on South Asia speculated:\n\n"First, the Kahuta facility is well-protected and is thus a hard target to destroy. Second and more important, India expects that any first strike by India against Kahuta would be swiftly followed by a Pakistani attack against India''s nuclear facilities. Such an exchange would leave India worse off, since any potential deterrent capability against China would thereby be eliminated. Finally, India would be wary of launching such an attack against Pakistan as it would cause not only great death and destruction to Pakistan, but could blow radioactive fall-out back over India. Such an attack against Pakistan would also alienate the Muslim Middle Eastern states whose amity India has assiduously cultivated."\n\nIn a meeting in Paris in July 1985, senior Israeli diplomats and a personal envoy of the late Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi reportedly examined the option in detail. As an incentive, Israel held out an offer to cooperate with India on military intelligence, defence production and transfer or technology. Yitzhak Rabin, then the Israeli Defence Minister, reportedly pinned a lot of hope on that meeting. But India, which had not yet forged diplomatic ties with the Jewish state, ultimately rejected the proposal, ostensibly because of the fear of possible nuclear retaliation by Pakistan and for fear of a possible backlash by Islamic states, including an oil embargo against it by the Muslim member-states of OPEC.\n\nIn 1991, India and Pakistan signed a treaty pledging that neither would preemptively attack the nuclear facilities of the other. However, as India’s and Pakistan’s animosity grows, this treaty has been rendered toothless and is unlikely to be adhered to by either side.\n\nIn the early 1990s, reports surfaced in London claiming Israel had repeatedly tried to pressure India into launching a joint strike on Pakistan''s nuclear weapons development plant at Kahuta. The reports claimed Israeli and Indian pilots would be aided by detailed satellite photographs of Kahuta provided by convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.\n\nAccording to a report in The Washington Times, citing US officials, Pakistan’s then Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed had notified the US government and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Israeli and Indian warplanes, equipped with long-range refueling gear and operating out of India, had planned to attack Pakistani nuclear facilities at dawn on Thursday, 28 May 1998.\n\nIt is possible that for Kahuta, the Israelis will use F-15 Strike Eagles to carry out the actual attack with F-16s providing air cover - a reversal of the roles in the operation against Osirak. Furthermore, it is almost certain that if Israel ever attempted to take out Pakistan’s nuclear weapons facilities, Kahuta will not be the only target and it is highly likely that the Plutonium Reactor at Khushab and the National Development Complex (NDC) at Fatehjung, among others, will be additional targets high on the priority list of the Israelis.\n\nSenior Israeli military intelligence officials had, of course, dismissed the notion that any kind of attack was being contemplated against Pakistan. Pakistan and India "are coming out of the closet and they are trying to drag us with them," one senior intelligence official said. "We have nothing to do with it. They are trying to force us into being a party in this. "The official also maintained that Pakistan''s infamous espionage and counter-espionage agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was acting on "faulty intelligence." The Israelis maintained that the misinformation may have been propaganda fed to them from some other body, the Iranians perhaps. "They took it seriously. They could have believed it, but they did the responsible thing and checked it out with the Americans," the official said. Not that the Americans could be trusted, given the fact that it was the United States which has supplied all the information and satellite photos of Pakistan''s nuclear installations to both Israel and India.\n\nThe assessment in Israel is that it does not believe that Pakistan sees the Jewish State as its enemy - not directly and at least not in the short-run. Israeli intelligence officials also do not believe that Pakistan has transferred nuclear or missile technology to nuclear-wannabe Iran. Moreover, they have no proof that Pakistan is or intends to engage in any nuclear cooperation with any other country. An Israeli defence analyst commented to this effect, "Pakistan will not transfer nuclear know-how to any other Muslim country, not out of fear of Israel, but because that would diminish its own importance in the Islamic World. Today, Pakistan is the Islamic world''s sole nuclear power, if there are two, Pakistan''s position would be reduced. So it is using its nuclear prowess not only as a deterrent against its enemies but also to bolster its relationship with its strategic friends".\n\nShai Feldman, Director of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel once stated, "I am certain that the Pakistanis have enough trouble on their hands and would refrain from doing something that would actually increase Israel''s incentive to cooperate with India. Why would they buy another enemy when the situation is as bad as it is?" Feldman said. "They are not stupid, and they probably know that if we had any evidence of transfer of technology to one of our adversaries then Israel would react and it wouldn''t be very pleasant," he added.\n\nAnd vice versa, Mr. Feldman.\n\nlink\n[url]http://www.grandestrategy.com/2009/03/wings-over-chagai-story-of-israels.html[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.68.54', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 12245),

The researchers, based at Toronto University''s Munk Centre for International Studies, said their discovery had profound implications.\n\n"This report serves as a wake-up call... these are major disruptive capabilities that the professional information security community, as well as policymakers, need to come to terms with rapidly," said researchers Ron Deibert and Rafal Rohozinski.\n\nAfter 10 months of study, the researchers concluded that GhostNet had invaded 1,295 computers in 103 countries, but it appeared to be most focused on countries in south Asia and south-east Asia, as well as the Dalai Lama''s offices in India, Brussels, London and New York. The network continues to infiltrate dozens of new computers each week.\n\nSuch a pattern, and the fact that the network seemed to be controlled from computers inside China, could suggest that GhostNet was set up or linked to Chinese government espionage agencies. However, the researchers were clear that they had not been able to identify who was behind the network, and said it could be run by private citizens in China or a different country altogether. A Chinese government spokesmen has denied any official involvement.\n\nGhostNet can invade a computer over the internet and penetrate and steal secret files. It can also turn on the cameras and microphones of an infected computer, effectively creating a bug that can monitor what is going inside the room where the computer is. Anyone could be watched and listened to.\n\nThe researchers said they had been tipped off to the network after having been asked by officials with the Dalai Lama to examine their computers. The officials had been worried that their computers were being infected and monitored by outsiders. The Chinese government regularly attacks the Tibetan exile movement as encouraging separatism and terrorism within China. The researchers found that the computers had succumbed to cyber-attack and that numerous files, including letters and emails, had been stolen. The intruders had also gained control of the electronic mail server of the Dalai Lama''s computers.\n\n"The investigation was able to conclude that Tibetan computer systems were compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive information, including documents from the private office of the Dalai Lama," the researchers concluded in their report. They have now notified various law enforcement agencies, including international groups and the FBI.\n\nThe news also comes as researchers at Cambridge University prepare to release a report today called Snooping Dragon, which looks at suspected Chinese cyber-monitoring of Tibetan exile groups. The report is expected to detail the unexpected scale and sophistication of such efforts by a government against a private body.\n\nlink\n[url]http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/29/china-computing[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.68.54', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 652, 12250),

The air force is passing through a transit phase. We will be handling and operating old and new weapon systems of various capabilities, you are required to maintain these assets for their optimum performance. These systems will require knowledge-based training, thus my focus will be on modern training techniques and on flight safety.

The F100-PW-229 EEP represents the latest evolution in the F100 series of engines, recognized worldwide for its safety, reliability and cost Effective operation.\n\n\n\n“The F100-PW-229 EEP is another example of Pratt & Whitney’s pioneering work in fighter engine technology,” said Warren Boley, Vice President of Pratt & Whitney Military Programs and Customer Support. “Not only does it offer superior performance capabilities for our armed forces, it reduces maintenance and life cycle costs at a time when value and efficiency are top priorities on the nation’s agenda.”\n\n\n\nThe F100-PW-229 EEP incorporates groundbreaking technology developed for the F135 and F119 propulsion systems, the world’s only fifth-generation fighter jet engines. The F100-229 EEP will provide advanced, dependable power for F-16 and F-15 aircraft around the world. In response to strong customer demand, the first engines will begin delivery of the new configuration in October of this year.\n\n\n\nThe F100-PW-229 EEP was created to dramatically decrease the cost of ownership without impacting performance. This was accomplished by increasing the engine depot inspection interval from 4,300 to 6,000 cycles and increasing durability of key components while maintaining the 29,100 pound thrust rating. The inspection interval increase extends the amount of time between scheduled depot maintenance from the average of 7-9 years to over 10-14 years depending on utilization rates. This increase consequently should reduce life cycle costs by 30 percent over the life of the engine. The F100-PW-229 EEP continues to be the only fighter engine funded and qualified by the U.S. Air Force to the 6,000 cycle capability.\n\n\n\nPratt & Whitney will offer customers the option to purchase the F100-PW-229 EEP as a complete engine or as an upgrade kit that will be made available to all -229 operators near the end of 2010. “The U.S. Air Force and several other operators of the P&W F100-PW-229 engine have expressed interest in having upgrade kits to modify their existing engines, so we’re working diligently to provide this capability for our customers,” Boley said.\n\n\n\n\nInitially, 74 F100-PW-229 EEP engines have been ordered, with the first delivery set for Republic of Korea. Additional deliveries will be headed to Morocco and Pakistan in early 2010. Pratt & Whitney is a world leader in the design, manufacture and service of aircraft engines, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines.

According to Pakistan’s High Commission in Laula Lumpur the Goodwill Cum Training visit of Pakistan Navy (PN) ships to Malaysia would further strengthen and enhance the existing friendly ties and mutual cooperation between Pakistan Navy and Royal Malaysian Navy.\n\nThis visit will also provide better opportunity to the PN ships and Royal Malaysian Navy to benefit from each other’s experience and mutual learning of new concepts and doctrine.\n\nDuring their stay, the ships will undertake number of activities with the Royal Malaysian Navy which includes friendly sports fixtures, exchange visits, courtesy calls and reception onboard ships.\n\nPN ships will also avail the opportunity to hold Joint/Passage exercises with Royal Malaysian Navy. Ship crew would also undertake community welfare work in one of the orphanage.\n\nPNS NASR is a Combat Support Ship of Pakistan Navy Fleet’s 9th Auxiliary and Mine Warfare Squadron. Her name, an Arabic Word meaning ‘Help’ denotes its combat support role so very vital for sustained operations at sea.\n\nThe ship is capable of providing fuel, water and stores to surface ships and helicopters at sea for prolonged perations and therefore acts as a lifeline of the Fleet.\n\nPNS NASR actively participated in LIMA-07 held at Langkawi Malaysia in December 2007. The ship contributed in Tsunami Relief Operations at Maldives and provided assistance to ‘Sidr’ cyclone effectees in Bangladesh.\n\nPNS BADR is a leading war ship of the 25th Destroyer Squadron of Pakistan Fleet. The ship is named after the famous battle fought in 624 AD at a place called BADR near Madinah. The ship is fitted with state of the art weapons and sensors manned by highly trained and motivated team.\n\n\n[url]http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=71864[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.72.185', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 12822),

The aim was to improve the bullet''s effectiveness by increasing its expansion upon impact.\n\nThe phrase ''dum-dum'' was later taken to include any soft-nosed or hollow pointed bullet.  The Hague Convention of 1899 outlawed the use of dum-dum bullets during warfare.\n\n[u]Source:[url]http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/dumdum.htm[/url][/u]\n\nSuch bullets are sometimes known as Dum-dum or dumdum bullets, after an early British example produced in the Dum Dum arsenal, near Calcutta, India. There were several expanding bullets produced by this arsenal for the .303 British cartridge, including soft point and hollow point designs. These were not the first expanding bullets, however; hollow point expanding bullets were commonly used for hunting thin skinned game in express rifles as early as the mid 1870s.[1]. The use of the term "Dum-dum", applied to expanding bullets other than the early .303 designs, is considered slang.[2] Manufacturers have many terms to describe the particular construction of the various types of expanding bullets, though most fall into the category of soft point or hollow point designs.\n\n[u]Source:[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dum-dum[/url][/u]', 0, 1, '119.154.47.145', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 697, 13296),

Personally I wouldn''t stop at all, and would instead accelerate and smash right into them (hopefully running over one of the buggers!). I would continue driving fast, while simultaneously pulling my gun out and switching the safety off (provided you carry with a round already chambered).\nPersonally, I''m a big proponent of the 3 Rules I mentioned in my previous post. Let me do a hypothetical rundown of the situation Mig described: I''m driving and talking on the phone at the same time (something which should be avoided at all times because it seriously hampers your "Situational Awareness" and ability to make snap decisions. If necessary, carry a hands-free for your phone), when suddenly 2 bikes stop in front of me. Not knowing what the intentions of the perpetrators are, I''ll assume the worst (that they''re here to kill me) and will immediately go to Condition Red. I''ll immediately floor the accelerator and ram the bikes (ideally at the spot between the 2 bikes which will topple both the bikes and discourage/delay the perps from following you). As I speed away, I''ll also pull out my gun and switch off the safety. Also, I''ll call the police and immediately inform them of the situation. I will [B]NOT[/B], however, get into a gunfight because my first priority is extracting myself ASAP, unharmed and intact.\nNow I know that this is a hypothetical debate, but it''s always best to have some kind of plan laid out in your head. The old saying "Even the best laid plans do not survive the first contact with the enemy" is true, and given the heightened emotional state you''ll be in, you might not follow your plan through exactly. But as long as you have SOME course of action planned out, you''ll atleast execute some part of your plan.\nTwo very important things to remember: First, always be prepared for the worst.

However, the plane lost all power at an altitude of 1,160 meters, although it was only about 6 km from the base''s runway.\n\n"There was some smoke in the cockpit, perhaps generated by the engine, which leaked into the environmental control system," Lt.-Col. Li said during an interview with China Central Television last week.\n\n"All readings on the instrument board vanished, red lights flashed and the radio went out," he said.\n\nUnder Air Force rules, fighter pilots may eject if their aircraft loses engine power below 2,000 meters and can''t be restarted.\n\nBefore Li lost contact with the control tower, the commander in the air base asked him to eject.\n\nBut Li Feng insisted on having another try.\n\n"I knew where the deadline (to abandon the aircraft) was and was prepared for the ejection, but I decided not to give up unless the fighter was totally out of control."\n\nAfter 106 seconds, Li was able to glide the fighter to a safe landing.\n\nDuring his service in the Air Force, Li handled another emergency in 1999, when his J-7 jet fighter caught fire at take-off.\n\nThe award ceremony was held by the People''s Liberation Army''s (PLA) Air Force Command in Guangzhou, capital of south China''s Guangdong Province.\n\nLi received the medal from Yang Dongming, Deputy Commander of the PLA''s Air Force, who came especially to the city for the ceremony on behalf of Commander Xu Qiliang.\n\nLi is a deputy commander of an aviation regiment in the PLA''s Guangzhou Military Area Command.\n\nThe First-Class Merit Citation is the second-highest military award can get. The Meritorious Pilot gold medal is the top award that the PLA Air Force grants to its pilots. Only a very small number of outstanding pilots have been awarded those medals since 1991.\n\nLi was also given 200,000 yuan (29,411 U.S. dollars) for his courage and composure, which allowed him to save the aircraft worth 200 million yuan. He will share the bonus with other people involved.\n\nThose who were in the control tower during the event won Second-Class Merit Citations.\n\nThe J-10 is the third generation of a single-engine fighter made by China''s largest state-owned aircraft maker, Aviation Industry Corp. of China.\nEditor: Deng Shasha\n\n\n[url]http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/29/content_11093380.htm[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.232.32', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 13348),

However, the plane lost all power at an altitude of 1,160 meters, although it was only about 6 km from the base''s runway.\n\n"There was some smoke in the cockpit, perhaps generated by the engine, which leaked into the environmental control system," Lt.-Col. Li said during an interview with China Central Television last week.\n\n"All readings on the instrument board vanished, red lights flashed and the radio went out," he said.\n\nUnder Air Force rules, fighter pilots may eject if their aircraft loses engine power below 2,000 meters and can''t be restarted.\n\nBefore Li lost contact with the control tower, the commander in the air base asked him to eject.\n\nBut Li Feng insisted on having another try.\n\n"I knew where the deadline (to abandon the aircraft) was and was prepared for the ejection, but I decided not to give up unless the fighter was totally out of control."\n\nAfter 106 seconds, Li was able to glide the fighter to a safe landing.\n\nDuring his service in the Air Force, Li handled another emergency in 1999, when his J-7 jet fighter caught fire at take-off.\n\nThe award ceremony was held by the People''s Liberation Army''s (PLA) Air Force Command in Guangzhou, capital of south China''s Guangdong Province.\n\nLi received the medal from Yang Dongming, Deputy Commander of the PLA''s Air Force, who came especially to the city for the ceremony on behalf of Commander Xu Qiliang.\n\nLi is a deputy commander of an aviation regiment in the PLA''s Guangzhou Military Area Command.\n\nThe First-Class Merit Citation is the second-highest military award can get. The Meritorious Pilot gold medal is the top award that the PLA Air Force grants to its pilots. Only a very small number of outstanding pilots have been awarded those medals since 1991.\n\nLi was also given 200,000 yuan (29,411 U.S. dollars) for his courage and composure, which allowed him to save the aircraft worth 200 million yuan. He will share the bonus with other people involved.\n\nThose who were in the control tower during the event won Second-Class Merit Citations.\n\nThe J-10 is the third generation of a single-engine fighter made by China''s largest state-owned aircraft maker, Aviation Industry Corp. of China.\nEditor: Deng Shasha\n\n\n[url]http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/29/content_11093380.htm[/url][/quote]\nLucky Li,could have lost his job for not following the SOP.He was suppose to eject below 2000m.', 0, 1, '116.71.4.124', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 13359),

The assertion seems to confirm Netanyahu''s own hawkishness, as well as the fears of US Middle East policymakers who support a more delicate approach to the region. From the interview account:\n\nIn an interview conducted shortly before he was sworn in today as prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu laid down a challenge for Barack Obama. The American president, he said, must stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons--and quickly--or an imperiled Israel may be forced to attack Iran''s nuclear facilities itself.\n\n\n"The Obama presidency has two great missions: fixing the economy, and preventing Iran from gaining nuclear weapons," Netanyahu told me. He said the Iranian nuclear challenge represents a "hinge of history" and added that "Western civilization" will have failed if Iran is allowed to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nIn unusually blunt language, Netanyahu said of the Iranian leadership, "You don''t want a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs. When the wide-eyed believer gets hold of the reins of power and the weapons of mass death, then the entire world should start worrying, and that is what is happening in Iran."\n\nHowever, further in Goldberg''s account of the interview comes more promising signs that Netanyahu, despite blunt statements, still reserves room for non-military, diplomatic measures to stymie Iranian nuclear development:\n\nNetanyahu said he would support President Obama''s decision to engage Iran, so long as negotiations brought about a quick end to Iran''s nuclear ambitions. "How you achieve this goal is less important than achieving it," he said, but he added that he was skeptical that Iran would respond positively to Obama''s appeals. In an hour-long conversation, held in the Knesset, Netanyahu tempered his aggressive rhetoric with an acknowledgement that nonmilitary pressure could yet work. "I think the Iranian economy is very weak, which makes Iran susceptible to sanctions that can be ratcheted up by a variety of means." When I suggested that this statement contradicted his assertion that Iran, by its fanatic nature, is immune to pressure, Netanyahu smiled thinly and said, "Iran is a composite leadership, but in that composite leadership there are elements of wide-eyed fanaticism that do not exist right now in any other would-be nuclear power in the world. That''s what makes them so dangerous."\n\n[url]http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/31/netanyahu-to-obama-stop-i_n_181293.html[/url]\n\n[b]Dang! Talk about having a nerve.

Chinese sources say it can hit aircraft out to 125 kilometers, air-launched cruise missiles out to 50 kilometers, and ballistic missiles out to 25 kilometers — representing ABM capability equivalent to the Indian AAD and American PAC-3.\n\n\nThere has been speculation that Pakistan acquired an HQ-9 variant called the FT-2000 some years ago as a short-term countermeasure against India’s airborne early warning and control aircraft, but no such missile has been seen in the country, and some sources say the FT-2000 was never actually produced.\n\n“China has always fulfilled its promise to meet Pakistan’s defense needs”Akhtar said. He noted that China needs Pakistan as a bulwark against Indian hegemony in southern Asia, and said the “all-weather, strategic Sino-Pak relationship had moved beyond a purely defense relationship” to a “deep economic relationship.” Akhtar also dismissed concerns about budget cuts, saying that the enduring Sino-Pak relationship makes him “optimistic that this would not affect Pakistan’s defensive capabilities in the long run.” But Shireen Mazari, a former head of the Institute of Strategic Studies, has written that the government’s Strategic Planning Division, which controls the planning and deployment of strategic weapons, had cut research and development funding in high-technology areas.\n\nKhan agreed. “The SPD’s funds have been curtailed,” especially for newer projects, he said. Strategic Planning Division officials have rejected these statements. Khan also said the SPD and the National Engineering and Scientific Commission, which handles the design and production of ballistic missiles and other defense programs, had been instructed to slow work on certain projects. “In the short to medium term, there might not be any effects, but in the long term, these reductions will cause fault lines which Pakistan cannot afford,” Khan said.

I am sorry I don''t have a pic that clears your concern. All the pics were taken in a way to show least blood.  \nOmer[/quote]\nThanx dear Omer for that update. I did observe the cuts at the base of the neck i.e. usually done for trophy mounting purpose. What I have seen, ''zibah'' is administered @ throat around Larynx.\n\nThis forum is a guiding tool as well for the learners. The reason of asking questions is in no way criticism of any kind, its clarification of any possible doubts. Taking this opportunity, I would like to put it down here in this post.\n\nSlaughtering is to be done from the front of the neck, between the throat and the head of the breast bone (Libba). The throat/oesophagus (Mirree), windpipe/trachea (Halkoom) and the two jugular veins (Wadijan) are cut in the neck without severing the spinal cord. This cut severes the arteries to the brain of the animal, thus depriving the brain of blood supply. As a result, the brain loses consciousness due to insufficient oxygen. This renders the animal unconscious, causing the animal the least amount of pain. \n\nThe Muslim slaughterer who carries out Zibah (Islamic method of slaughter) cuts the two jugular veins, which carry blood from the brain to the heart, and the two carotid arteries, which transport blood from the heart to the brain. This leads to blood drainage instantaneously which ultimately results in a sudden dip in blood pressure. Meanwhile, messages are still being transmitted from the brain to the heart to pump more blood to the brain. This phenomenon causes more blood to gush out of the cut region. In addition, natural responses from the pulse, respiration, and blood ejaculation by muscular contraction and movements of the limbs further result in a more thorough bleeding.', 0, 1, '110.37.64.97', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 706, 13782),

I never actually came around to buying a weapon mainly due to the lack of proper information and guidance. I just didn''t want to take the dealer''s word for what he thought was a suitable weapon.\n\nHowever I discovered Pakguns.com last week (clicked the banner on Pakwheels) and found this incredibly informative and useful community.

The commander of the French Joint Forces in the Indian Ocean, Vice Admiral Gerard Valin, said India''s military assets had to develop to reflect its position as a key world player, including in maintaining world stability. Asked if that meant having nuclear attack submarines, he told reporters in Mumbai: "For me it''s legitimate."\n\n"A nuclear-propelled submarine gives you mobility. France has a nuclear deterrent. To have a nuclear deterrent you must have submarines capable of ensuring the security of a large area," he added. "I think that India will be in the same situation" in the future, he said. India''s naval chief said in 2007 that the country''s first domestically built nuclear-powered submarine would be ready for sea trials by this year. The vessel is expected to be an adaptation of the Russian Charlie II class submarine and capable of firing nuclear warheads.\n\nSince then, India has test-fired nuclear-capable ballistic missiles from undersea platforms as part of an ongoing programme to develop land and sea-borne nuclear and conventional missile systems. France and India have been steadily developing military ties. Last week the Indian and French navies took part in anti-submarine exercises off the coast of the western state of Goa, said Valin. India''s navy is also involved in the international effort to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa. Part of Valin''s mandate is marine law enforcement, including targeting high seas hijacks by armed bandits in the same area.\n\n\nIn October 2005 India signed contracts worth 2.4 billion euros (3.8 billion dollars) with Armaris, which is owned by France''s Thales, and European defence firm MBDA to buy six Scorpene submarines. They are being assembled in India and are slated to begin operations from 2015.\nFrench companies are also looking to make inroads into India''s civilian atomic energy market, following the lifting last year of an embargo on nuclear deals with India imposed in 1974 after New Delhi staged nuclear tests.\n\nlink\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/04/india-should-have-nuclear-attack.html[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.72.195', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 14843),

There will be no nuclear warfare but a short, swift war that could have menacing consequences for India,” said an army officer, who was part of the three-day war games that ended on Wednesday. In the military’s assessment, based on a six-month study of various scenarios before the war games, “China would rely on information warfare (IW) to bring India down on its knees before launching an offensive”, the report claimed.\n\nThe war games saw generals raising concerns about the IW battalions of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) carrying out hacker attacks for military espionage, intelligence collection, paralysing communication systems, compromising airport security, inflicting damage on the banking system and disabling power grids. “We need to spend more on developing information warfare capability,” he said. The war games dispelled the notion that China would take at least one year for a substantial military build-up across India’s northeastern frontiers. “The Tibetan infrastructure has been improved considerably. “The PLA can now launch an assault very quickly, without any warning,” said the officer.\n\n“The military believes that China would have swamped Tibet with sweeping demographic changes in the medium term. For the purposes of Divine Matrix, China would call Dalai Lama for rapprochement and neutralise him. The top brass also brainstormed over India’s options in case Pakistan joined the war too. Another apprehension was that Myanmar and Bangladesh would align with China in the future geo-strategic environment,” said the Hindustan Times. daily times monitor\n\n[url]http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\\03\\27\\story_27-3-2009_pg7_45[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.72.195', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 14847),

He said this was the maiden visit for ''Badr'' in Malaysia, while ''Nasr'' had been sailing here regularly, especially to provide support for Pakistan naval ships which participated in LIMA, the bi-annual military showcase in Langkawi.Kamran described the ties between the two naval forces as good, adding that last March, they were involved in a joint naval exercise, ''AMAN'', in Pakistan where the Malaysian Navy sent ''KD Kedah'' and its crew to participate. He said Pakistan would like to study the possibility of placing its female naval personnel on board warships like what was being done in the Malaysian Navy.Currently, Pakistan Navy female personnel were working in the information technology, medical and education sectors of the navy.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/04/two-pakistan-naval-ships-dock-in-port.html[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.72.195', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 14848),

Avoid commuting in expensive cars & SUVs.\n2. If you own an expensive cell phone use a handsfree to talk on it in public. You accessories(watch, cellphone etc.) gives out a lot about what you are.\n3. There mostly an insider involved so be wary of giving out personal information like office timings, working hours, places you go to at a given time & on a given day, your financial standing, your profits, quoting prices of items of interest in your pocession and the like. Only provide information on a need to know basis. For the brevity of it: Keep you eyes open & you mouth shut.\n4. If your work requires visiting a bank on a regular basis, make good terms with the manager and handle all transactions from his room. Do not take cash at cash counters. Keep changing the times & days that you visit a bank.\n5. Be unpreditable in every action. Do not keep fixed timings & use same routes. Art of war is based upon deception.\n6. If you have an enemity, most cultures in our region will not attack you if you have a third person with you. They wouldnt want another enemity if they hurt another person. Always keep a friend with you when you go out.\n7. Keep a weapon. Always. And when you do and you travel alone mostly never let anyone know under any circumstances that you own one. Detente doesnnt apply to kidnapping for ransom when your travelling or commuting without a personal security detail. If they want to kidnap you they will kidnap you and if they know you might be armed their primary objective would be to get you unarmed by all means which is likely to turn voilent. \n8. Most kidnappings in upper punjab takes place on the highways & motor ways. Keep your eyes on the view mirrors. Keep a good safe distance from all approaching vehicles. Kidnappers usually use two vehicles and try to squeeze you into stopping from front & rear. Almost all of them use 95-98 model Toyota Corrollas. If you see two speeding cars approaching your vehicle and the instant they''re near you, change the lane and slow down and let them pass. They''ll panic and will blow their intention and you''ll have a cushion and space to get out. If you have a weapon, I would prefer a machine pistol at that time or a handy pump action, FIRE at them & get away. 99% of them will not come after you. SHOTGUNS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS IN CLOSE QUARTER ENGAGEMENTS. Learn how to load ammo with one hand esp when driving.\n9. Do not go to collect cash payments.\n10. Do not meet unknown people. I was lured and invited to a business deal in Bahawalpur and was kidnapped.\n11. NEVER accept drinks & food at a strange place by strange people. Keep a LIVE chambered rounds when you anticipate things to escalate.\n12. If confronted with a situation, be offensive VERY offensive & ruthless but retreat IMMEDIATELY when they dont expect you to. Shock & Awe.\n13. Your children & family members are the kidnappers primary target. Your drivers & servants are usually the primary sources of information. Always drop & pickup your children from the school. The timings would be fixed so keep changing the routes. Make sure your children know home addresses & your telephone numbers and of your friends  family. Make sure your children know the way to home. They should know how to hire a taxi or riskshaw. Do drills with them for different kind of situations. IMPORTANT: Your servants should be SHIT scared of you. So scared that they''d wet their clothes. This again works for a repellent. Have copies of their ID cards. Home addresses. Addresses of their close relatives, every one of them. Know the ISDN number of the mobile phone sets that they use. Never trust anyone. Keep them well paid and have them trust & love you as well. Dont talk about financial matters in their presence. Do not make cash transactions in their presence and let them have an approximation of your net worth.\n14. If you think you are eligible enough to be kidnapped, you can afford a personal security detail as well. Try not to hire personnel from security companies. They CANNOT be trusted. With all due respect, esp the tribals because they are unpredictable. Never let two guards have good relations or friendly terms with the other. Always make sure theyre against the other. This can be accomplished by keeping guards from different ethnicities esp ethnicities which are at loggerheads with the other. Pair them up if they have different political idealogies. You know inside out. Never hire two guards from the same security company. Keep changing them regularly. \n15. Never let you kid trust your servants of security guards. Tell your kids to panic & start shouting once they see an unusualy situation or an unusual route.\n\nNever ever neglect or takes things easy or give any one an opportunity against you.

By the wa I live in a busy Society area of Karachi and own a couple of weapons,which by the grace of Allah were never used on intruders. \n\nThe theory given by the elders on low walls is that these robbers/gangsters never try to enter a place which can be seen clearly from outside. This makes them vulnerable.

They were pressuring him to get the main door opened from inside when the old man started shouting my servants names with cries of help. They heard and looked over the wall to see this scene, as soon as they saw that they had been discovered they ran. Two young guys wearing jeans etc on a white car with a third waiting in the car. I missed the scene by minutes as my library over looks that exact spot in their house. \n\nThe law and order situation is getting out of hand. Perhaps my house was avoided because of shotgun carrying guards but this is still insane. Openly breaking in at 12:30 in the afternoon! We need to protect our homes against these sort of people.

(12624, 373, 6773, 'Thunder', 124, '', 1239305740, '[b] China Adds Precision Strike To Capabilities[/b]\n\nChina has been developing and purchasing weapons for precision-strike warfare. This is the hard edge of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) doctrinal drive toward using increasingly sophisticated information technologies such as C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) to improve the capabilities of weapon systems (DTI March, p. 39). The PLA’s near-term goals appear to be greater asymmetric capabilities to target U.S. naval assets in the western Pacific and in space as part of an anti-access strategy. Long-term, however, greater precision will be a feature of most new weapon systems.\n\nChina’s growing C4ISR capabilities were demonstrated in March by its coordinated two-fleet operation to intercept two U.S. Navy ocean survey vessels. Chinese ships found and harassed the USNS Victorious, operating in the Yellow Sea, and USNS Impeccable, which was about 75 mi. south of Hainan Island. The fallout was diplomatic, as Washington and Beijing clashed over interpretations of the Law of the Sea Treaty, which Beijing contends gives it rights to deny access to military survey missions. This incident, though, was reminiscent in timing and scope to the April 2001 clash that saw China “capture” a U.S. Navy EP-3 electronic intelligence aircraft off Hainan.\n\nChina’s aggressive challenge of Japanese claims in the East China Sea, plus Washington’s refusal to cease its survey missions could be flashpoints. In February, a provincial Communist Party newspaper contained a threat to sink U.S. survey ships.\n\nIn this second of three articles on China’s growing regional power, DTI examines the country’s efforts to improve its ability to target and destroy threats.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Chinese military scholars have been warning of the need for China to prepare to defend against, and if necessary, conduct military operations in space. In late 2006 reports emerged of China’s use of high-power ground-based lasers to “dazzle” U.S. surveillance satellites. On Feb. 11, 2007, China launched the first successful intercept by its SC-19 direct-ascent antisatellite (ASAT) system, derived from its KT-1 solid-fuel space-launch vehicle, with an interceptor stage whose development was likely aided by China’s micro-satellite programs. A target FY-2 weather satellite was probably illuminated by large phased-array radar developed for tracking Shenzhou manned space capsules. A far less-noted potential co-orbital ASAT demonstration occurred on Sept. 27, 2008, when the Shenzhou-7 manned spacecraft, which had just launched a BX-1 nanosatellite, passed within 45 km. (28 mi.) of the International Space Station. Following the U.S. Navy’s shootdown of an errant satellite on Feb. 21, 2008, and a Mar. 5, 2008, announcement that Russia would resume ASAT development, it is likely that China will continue ASAT testing.\n\nChina’s direct-ascent ASAT also proves that it is capable of developing a long-range antiballistic missile (ABM) system, a U.S. pursuit that China has opposed. China had an ABM program from 1963-80 that produced a short-range interceptor prototype and long-range radar. Chinese sources told DTI at the recent IDEX expo in Abu Dhabi (see p. 16) that they have tested the new FD-2000 surface-to-air missile (SAM) in an antitactical ballistic missile (ATBM) mode. Developed with help from Russia’s Almaz-Antey Co., the FD-2000 also draws from the earlier passive-guided FT-2000 SAM, which reportedly benefited from U.S. Patriot SAM technology. These indigenous SAMs are entering PLA service, and will complement about 1,000 Almaz-Antey S-300/PMU-1/PMU-2 SAMs purchased since the early 1990s, giving the PLA air force the most formidable air-defense network in Asia. The PLA has also developed short-range SAM systems—including man-portable air-defense systems—for tracked vehicles and trucks. Among these is the TY-90 Yitian for trucks and armored personnel carriers that was disclosed in 2005, but displayed for the first time at IDEX this year.\n\nIncreasing precision is also the hallmark of new PLA surface-to-surface missiles and air-launched weapons. New Chinese nuclear ballistic missile warheads feature smaller sharp-tip warheads, signifying higher precision. One warhead configuration for the 12,000-km.-range DF-31A ICBM places at least one warhead on a delivery bus that is apparently capable of radical maneuvering to evade ABM defenses.\n\nMedium- and short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) are also being upgraded for greater precision. The U.S. and Japanese navies have long been concerned with the PLA program to create an antiship ballistic missile, by placing a maneuverable terminally guided warhead on the 2,400-km.-range DF-21, and likely, on the 600-km. DF-15. Asian military sources are also concerned that a new 3,000-km. version of the DF-21 may have multiple terminally guided warheads.\n\nAn early 2009 Taiwanese estimate places the DF?15, DF-11 Mod2 and new land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs) of the second artillery missile force targeting Taiwan at more than 1,500, with newer versions having navigation satellite (navsat) guidance. In 2007 a Chinese source told DTI that the PLA will also be using two new shorter-range SRBMs, the truck-mounted 250-km. B-611M and 150-km. air-transportable P-12. Both are maneuverable, navsat-guided weapons with modular warheads. The PLA is also developing longer-range artillery rocket-based SRBMs, like the 200-km. navsat-guided WS-3. Some Chinese sources indicate that an antiradar or passive-guided 300-km. version of the WS series is possible.\n\nAsian sources say the PLA has developed two families of strategic-range LACMs: the DH-10, which equips new units of the Second Artillery, and YJ-62/C-602, which equips PLA navy destroyers and land-based antiship missile units, and is to be developed into an air-launched version for the PLA air force. The air force is expected to equip a new version of the 1950s-era Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 Badger bomber, the Xian H-6K, with the weapon. The H-6Ks modified with more powerful engines, now have a potential 3,000-km. radius—enough to reach Guam. Rumors have long surrounded a potential long-range bomber program at Xian Aircraft Co., and a new stealthy version of Xian’s JH-7A fighter bomber is also in development.\n\nTactical combat aircraft in the PLA air force and navy are receiving new Russian and indigenously designed air-to-air and ground-attack weapons. The air force’s first Sukhoi Su-27SK fighters had the helmet-sighted Vympel R-73 missile a decade before the Raytheon AIM-9X entered U.S. service. The BVR self-guided Vympel R-77 followed the Su-30MKK into PLA service early this decade. But new Chengdu Aircraft Corp. J-10 and Shenyang Aircraft Corp. J-11B multirole fighters will carry air-to-air missiles designed by Luoyang Opto-Electric Co. (LOEC), which include the self-guided PL-12, thought to have a range approaching 100 km. in lofted delivery. Chinese sources also indicate LOEC is developing a high off-boresight air-to-air missile (AAM) similar to the South African Denel A-Darter, and a long-range ramjet-powered AAM.\n\nRussian Su-30s in PLA service have been equipped with several guided munitions, including the Zvezda Kh-31 antiradar and antiship ramjet missile, Zvezda Kh-59 interdiction missile and optical image-correlation-guided KAB series bombs. At the 2005 Moscow air show, a Russian source disclosed that Russia had assisted China’s development of electro-optical targeting pods, which have been photographed on J-10, JH-7A and some Hongdu Q-5 fighter-bombers. These will help guide two new families of laser- and navsat-guided bombs developed by LOEC and China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC). The latter’s FT family includes the 500-kg. (1,100-lb.) FT-1 navsat-guided bomb, the FT-2, which adds range-extending wings, the 250-kg. FT-3 and the 100-kg. FT-5, which is reportedly comparable with Boeing’s Small Diameter Bomb. At last November’s Zhuhai air show, LOEC revealed a dual-optical navsat-guided bomb. CASC’s bombs can be expected to follow suit.\n\nPrecision is being packed into smaller munitions like the new 45-kg. AR-1, a laser-guided missile designed for the CH-3 unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), similar in capability to the U.S. Predator-1. Guizhou Aircraft Co. has likely developed a larger turbofan UCAV comparable to the MQ-9 Predator-B/Reaper.\n\nMost of China’s new precision-strike systems are for sale. Pakistan and Iran have benefited from China’s ballistic and cruise missile technology, and from sales of conventional systems. Many more countries are likely to consider the $22-million Chengdu FC-1 and $41-million J-10 fighters, especially when equipped with precision-guided munitions like the PL-12 and FT-1. This form of power projection will soon be joined by the PLA’s increasing power-projection capabilities, the subject of the final installment.\n\n[url]http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&id=news/CHINA040809.xml&headline=China%20adds%20precision%20strike%20to%20capabilities[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.69.211', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 15408),

Pakistan is the eighth international customer to join the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard flying with Sniper ATP. The contract includes spares and training services. Terms of the contract were not disclosed. “This sale culminates a two year combined effort by Lockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control and Aeronautics businesses to upgrade the precision attack capability of one of our key allies,” said Ken Fuhr, director of Fixed Wing Targeting Programs at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. “Sniper continues to demonstrate exceptional performance in meeting the requirements and expectations of the Warfighter.” With deliveries [having begun] in 2008, the Pakistan Air Force will benefit from Sniper ATP’s exceptional stability and superior imagery, allowing aircrews to perform intelligence, targeting, surveillance and reconnaissance missions from extended standoff ranges. The Pakistan Air Force joins the U.K. Ministry of Defence; the Canadian Forces, the Royal Norwegian Air Force; the Polish Air and Air Defense Force; the Royal Air Force of Oman; the Belgium Defence; and other international customers with its selection of the Sniper ATP. Sniper ATP is currently flying on the U.S. Air Force and multinational F-15s, F-16s, F-18s, A-10s, B-1s and the Harrier GR9. Sniper ATPs have accumulated tens of thousands of flight hours in thousands of sorties in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.Sniper incorporates a high-resolution, mid-wave third-generation forward-looking infrared (FLIR), a dual-mode laser permitting eye-safe operation in urban environments, a CCD-TV along with a laser spot tracker and a laser marker. Sniper is fully compatible with the latest J-series munitions and precision-guided weaponry. Its superior detection ranges are vital to pilots, helping keep them out of range of threat air defenses.

I dont mind using either in a SD/HD situation. 5.56 is offered in a variety of firearms whereas x39 is just AK for the most part. AK design is such that it makes it near indestructable and reliable as it can be. Then thats just the design not the ammo. 5.56 is much smoother to shot than x39, but x39 has more impact on the target- how much more? Not enough for me to give up 5.56''s advantages in range. The real difference in power kicks in when you move from 5.56 to x51. So what does all this mean?\n1. X51 for special roles where you need to hit hard and distance.\n2. 5.56 is .22 high velocity and light ammo that can be carried in larger numbers than x39, therefore, better option in combat. \n3. Ak beats M16 on reliability not accuracy.\n4. Whats the perfect solution for a service rifle that has AK''s reliability and M16''s accuracy: Galil 5.56.\n5. Even Russians realized this and moved to 5.45x39 in 1974.\n6. It does not mean x39 is useless. It remains excellant round for under 250 yards combat because at that distance it wont lose much trajectory to effect accuracy yet it will yield more power than 5.56.\n\nIn conclusion: they are both good rounds.

Even if they are not, treat them as if they are.\n\n2. Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy. (For those who insist that this particular gun is unloaded, see Rule 1.)\n\n3. Keep your finger off the trigger till your sights are on the target. This is the Golden Rule. Its violation is directly responsible for about 60 percent of inadvertent discharges.\n\n4. Identify your target, and what is behind it. Never shoot at anything that you have not positively identified.\n\nsomething similar from a hunting publication:\n\nThe Ten Commandments of Firearms Safety\n\n1. Treat every gun with the respect due a loaded gun.\n2. Watch that muzzle! Be able to control the direction of the muzzle even if you should stumble.\n3. Be sure barrel and action are clear of obstructions and that you have only ammunition of the proper size for the gun you are carrying.\n4. Be sure of your target before you pull the trigger; know identifying features of the game you hunt. Never shoot at a sound or movement.\n5. Unload guns when not in use. Take down or have actions open; guns should be carried in cases to the shooting area.\n6. Never point a gun at anything you do not want to shoot; avoid all horseplay with a firearm.\n7. Never climb a fence or tree or jump a ditch with a loaded gun; never pull a gun toward you by the muzzle.\n8.

Q. Khan and other members of his group accused of providing nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.\n\nThe Indian lobby on Capitol Hill played a key role in including the two clauses into the bill and had formed a special task force for this purpose.\n\nThe Pakistani caucus, which once started as an effective lobbying group, has been rendered useless by the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. To ensure that it cannot function as an independent body, the embassy purged all senior people from a support group created to provide technical support to the caucus.\n\nConsequently, the Pakistan caucus, which on papers has the support of almost 100 lawmakers, has become a non-functioning body with no clout on the Hill.\n\nAlthough two separate bills are now being moved in the House and the Senate for tripling US economic assistance to Pakistan, the motivation for doing so did not come from the Pakistan Embassy or the lobbies.\n\nThe motivating force behind the move is America’s fear that if not helped, Pakistan, a nuclear nation of 170 million people, could turn into a safe haven for terrorists armed with atomic weapons.\n\nThe need for Pakistan’s help in fighting the Taliban and al Qaeda militants in Afghanistan and Fata also played a key role in motivating US lawmakers for seeking to increase the aid to Pakistan.\n\nBut this did not prevent the House members from seeking strict restrictions against Pakistan in return for the aid.\n\nClause (H) of the bill requires Pakistan not to provide any support, direction, guidance to, or acquiescence in the activities of, any person or group that engages in any degree in acts of violence or intimidation against civilians, civilian groups, or governmental entities.\n\nClause (I) needs Pakistan to redouble its efforts to prevent the presence of the Taliban and Taliban-affiliated groups in Pakistan that support insurgents in Afghanistan.\n\nTo ensure transparency and provide effective accountability of all US assistance and reimbursements provided to Pakistan, the bill wants Islamabad to improve counterterrorism financing and anti-money laundering laws to comply with international standards, to include applying for ‘Financial Action Task Force’ observer status and adhering to the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\n\nThe task force is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe bill also requires Pakistan to take all appropriate measures to adapt its armed forces to be able to conduct effective and sustained counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations.\n\nThe bill, however, also recognises Pakistan as an invaluable friend and ally to the United States, ‘both in times of strife and in times of peace.’\n\nIt notes that the two countries share many common goals, including combating terrorism and violent radicalism, solidifying democracy and rule of law in Pakistan, and promoting the social and material well-being of the people of Pakistan.\n\nThe bill assures the Pakistani people that the United States seeks a ‘sustained, long-term, multifaceted relationship’ with Pakistan based on friendship between the peoples of the two countries, the commitment to democracy and the rule of law, and the mutual interests of stability, security, and prosperity.\n\n‘It is critical for the United States to support Pakistan''s democratic government and strengthen its democratic institutions, including its parliament and the judicial system,’ the bill notes.\n\nThe bill also makes it clear that the United States supports Pakistan''s struggle against extremist elements and ‘recognises the profound sacrifice made by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, including the loss of more than 1,600 soldiers since 2001 in combat with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremist and terrorist groups.’\n\n[url]http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/world/us-aid-bill-seeks-protection-for-india--bi[/url]', 0, 1, '115.42.68.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 15799),

The success percentage of the US predator strikes thus comes to not more than six per cent.\n\nFigures compiled by the Pakistani authorities show that a total of 701 people, including 14 al-Qaeda leaders, have been killed since January 2006 in 60 American predator attacks targeting the tribal areas of Pakistan. Two strikes carried out in 2006 had killed 98 civilians while three attacks conducted in 2007 had slain 66 Pakistanis, yet none of the wanted al-Qaeda or Taliban leaders could be hit by the Americans right on target.\n\nHowever, of the 50 drone attacks carried out between January 29, 2008 and April 8, 2009, 10 hit their targets and killed 14 wanted al-Qaeda operatives. Most of these attacks were carried out on the basis of intelligence believed to have been provided by the Pakistani and Afghan tribesmen who had been spying for the US-led allied forces stationed in Afghanistan.\n\nThe remaining 50 drone attacks went wrong due to faulty intelligence information, killing hundreds of innocent civilians, including women and children. The number of the Pakistani civilians killed in those 50 attacks stood at 537, in which 385 people lost their lives in 2008 and 152 people were slain in the first 99 days of 2009 (between January 1 and April 8).\n\nOf the 50 drone attacks, targeting the Pakistani tribal areas since January 2008, 36 were carried out in 2008 and 14 were conducted in the first 99 days of 2009. Of the 14 attacks targeting Pakistan in 2009, three were carried out in January, killing 30 people, two in February killing 55 people, five in March killing 36 people and four were conducted in the first nine days of April, killing 31 people.\n\nOf the 14 strikes carried out in the first 99 days of April 2009, only one proved successful, killing two most wanted senior al-Qaeda leaders - Osama al Kini and Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan. Both had lost their lives in a New Year’s Day drone strike carried out in the South Waziristan region on January 1, 2009.Kini was believed to be the chief operational commander of al-Qaeda in Pakistan and had replaced Abu Faraj Al Libi after his arrest from Bannu in 2004. Both men were behind the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Dares Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, which killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others.\n\nThere were 36 recorded cross-border US predator strikes inside Pakistan during 2008, of which 29 took place after August 31, 2008, killing 385 people. However, only nine of the 36 strikes hit their actual targets, killing 12 wanted al-Qaeda leaders. The first successful predator strike had killed Abu Laith al Libi, a senior military commander of al-Qaeda who was targeted in North Waziristan on January 29, 2008. The second successful attack in Bajaur had killed Abu Sulayman Jazairi, al-Qaeda’s external operations chief, on March 14, 2008. The third attack in South Waziristan on July 28, 2008, had killed Abu Khabab al Masri, al-Qaeda’s weapons of mass destruction chief. The fourth successful attack in South Waziristan on August 13, 2008, had killed al-Qaeda leader Abdur Rehman.\n\nThe fifth predator strike carried out in North Waziristan near Miranshah on Sept 8, 2008 had killed three al-Qaeda leaders, Abu Haris, Abu Hamza, and Zain Ul Abu Qasim. The sixth successful predator hit in the South Waziristan region on October 2008 had killed Khalid Habib, a key leader of al-Qaeda’s paramilitary Shadow Army.\n\nThe seventh such attack conducted in North Waziristan on October 31, 2008 had killed Abu Jihad al Masri, a top leader of the Egyptian Islamic group. The eighth successful predator strike had killed al-Qaeda leader Abdullah Azzam al Saudi in east of North Waziristan on November 19, 2008.\n\nThe ninth and the last successful drone attack of 2008, carried out in the Ali Khel region just outside Miramshah in North Waziristan on November 22, 2008, had killed al-Qaeda leader Abu Zubair al Masri and his Pakistani fugitive accomplice Rashid Rauf.\n\nAccording to the figures compiled by the Pakistani authorities, a total of 537 people have been killed in 50 incidents of cross-border US predator strikes since January 1, 2008 to April 8, 2009, averaging 34 killings per month and 11 killings per attack. The average per month killings in predator strikes during 12 months of 2008 stood at 32 while the average per attack killings in the 36 drone strikes for the same year stood at 11.\n\nSimilarly, 152 people have been killed in 14 incidents of cross-border predator attacks in the tribal areas in the first 99 days of 2009, averaging 38 killings per month and 11 killings per attack.\n\n60 drone hits kill 14 al-Qaeda men, 687 civilians - GEO.tv', 0, 1, '115.42.68.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 15805),

The Lord dipped His hand into the water and pulled up a golden thimble set with sapphires.\n“Is this your thimble?” the Lord asked. The seamstress replied, “No.”\nThe Lord again dipped into the river. He held out a golden thimble studded with rubies.\n“Is this your thimble?” the Lord asked. Again, the seamstress replied, “No.”\nThe Lord reached down again and came up with a leather thimble.\n“Is this your thimble?” the Lord asked. The seamstress replied, “Yes.” The Lord was pleased with the woman’s honesty and gave her all three thimbles to keep, and the seamstress went home happy.\nSome years later, the seamstress was walking with her husband along the riverbank, and her husband fell into the river and disappeared under the water. When she cried out, the! Lord again appeared and asked her, “Why are you crying?” “Oh Lord, my husband has fallen into the river!”\nThe Lord went down into the water and came up with George Clooney. “Is this your husband?” the Lord asked.\n“Yes,” cried the seamstress. The Lord was furious. “You lied! That is an untruth!”  The seamstress replied, “Oh, forgive me, my Lord. It is a misunderstanding. You see, if I had said ‘no’ to George Clooney, you would have come up with Brad Pitt.\nThen if I said ‘no’ to him, you would have come up with my husband.

Be unpreditable in every action. Do not keep fixed timings & use same routes. Art of war is based upon deception.\n7. Keep a weapon. Always. And when you do and you travel alone mostly never let anyone know under any circumstances that you own one. Detente doesnnt apply to kidnapping for ransom when your travelling or commuting without a personal security detail. If they want to kidnap you they will kidnap you and if they know you might be armed their primary objective would be to get you unarmed by all means which is likely to turn voilent. \n8. Most kidnappings in upper punjab takes place on the highways & motor ways. Keep your eyes on the view mirrors. Keep a good safe distance from all approaching vehicles. Kidnappers usually use two vehicles and try to squeeze you into stopping from front & rear. Almost all of them use 95-98 model Toyota Corrollas. If you see two speeding cars approaching your vehicle and the instant they''re near you, change the lane and slow down and let them pass. They''ll panic and will blow their intention and you''ll have a cushion and space to get out. If you have a weapon, I would prefer a machine pistol at that time or a handy pump action, FIRE at them & get away. 99% of them will not come after you. SHOTGUNS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS IN CLOSE QUARTER ENGAGEMENTS. Learn how to load ammo with one hand esp when driving.\n11. NEVER accept drinks & food at a strange place by strange people. Keep a LIVE chambered rounds when you anticipate things to escalate.\n14. If you think you are eligible enough to be kidnapped, you can afford a personal security detail as well. Try not to hire personnel from security companies. They CANNOT be trusted\n[/quote]\n\nGood advice Glxspk.  I would like to add a bit to it.  I have been working in the NWFP for the last 1.5 years and during that time, two of my colleagues have gotten kidnapped.  Furthermore, there have been two attempts on me so far which i can classify as attempts.  I would like to point out that I now travel with a personal security detail [i](plus have my own weapon with me)[/i] which is a chase car with two armed guards following me all the way from the NWFP to Islamabad.  \n\nDuring this point in time, we have undergone quite a bit of training on kidnap scenarios.  Since my company is a multinational and in more than 100 countries, we can leverage those learnings as well. Teams from high risk / crime areas e.g. South Africa have come down to brief us and in fact, there is a K&R [i](Kidnap & Ransom) [/i]training in Islamabad for us in this week; some experts from our global offices flying down.  The common themes which pretty much every expert has quoted, some of which I will reproduce below:\n\n1) Unpredictability - this is the most important.  Because if they mean to kidnap you, they will.  Only security to the level of a presidential detail can probably ensure safety [i](keeping in mind that in Pakistan, even soldiers in fully armed convoys are kidnapped)[/i]\n2) As far as weapons are concerned, there is an interesting view from a British consultant (ex-SAS) whom we had over for a security assessment.  As far as he is concerned, a weapon in the hand of us civilians is only a deterrence due to lack of proper training / exposure or in his words "a bluff".  If the kidnappers are willing to take a risk [i](in case they think you are a lucrative target)[/i] and escalate, this bluff will be called and either they will take you or you will wind up dead [i](since odds are against you)[/i]. In his view, weapon display or use is last resort and must only be used in two circumstances which are 1) To surprise them thus allowing you to run away or 2) If there is no choice and you prefer death to kidnapping :).\n3) Weapon will probably have more impact against an "Opportunistic kidnapping" as opposed to a "Planned kidnapping".  As the planned kidnapping will have accounted for all risks and they are after YOU specifically[i] (in an opportunistic one, they will disregard you upon seeing a weapon and will go to the next softer target)[/i]\n4) There are two types of kidnappers.  a) Common criminals - carry out planned kidnappings, try to avoid violence and b) Displaced people or Pseudo Taliban - usually opportunistic and no hesitation in using violence\n5) If you do get kidnapped, try and not threaten the kidnappers with consequences etc just comply.  They can and will kill you at this stage as they have nothing to lose.  An example is of a Wapda XEN who was kidnapped from Nowshera, ransom was paid, he was released and then shot in the back as he was walking away because the kidnappers thought he had recognised them.\n\nIn other words, I more or less agree with all of your points above i.e. 5, 7, 11 and 14.  I would tend to disagree with point 8 due to the following reasons:\n\nFirst of all we cannot be general about the cars being used by them.  In the two cases of my colleagues, latest model corollas were used.  In the case of one, a civic with a police flasher and kidnappers in police uniforms were used.  Secondly, in this area, at times police also stop you in this manner i.e. two speeding cars, specifically anti car lifting cell so before opening fire be very certain or you will go to jail for a very long time.  Also keep in mind that if they signal you to stop and you run, if they are genuine police, they will never open fire on a public road........they will follow you and relay word to the next "naka" where they WILL open fire you if you dont stop.  They will only retaliate on the road if you open fire on them.  By the way, most kidnappings in NWFP take place during broad daylight...........since kidnappers can assess you more easily.\n\nI will relate some incidents which will make it a bit clear:\n\n1) One of my colleagues was kidnapped near Lawrencepur around 9 pm.  Two cars with police flashers pulled them over and guys dressed in police uniforms took him leaving his wife behind.  They knew all the details about him and knew that he usually travelled with a guard.  From what they told him, they were ready to kill the guard and him, if he had touched his weapon [i](which he did not have)[/i].  Interestingly, he was picked up from between two motorway police cruisers [i](he had passed one and the other one was parked barely 300 yds down the road when he was stopped.....he could see its lights)[/i] He was released after paying ransom. By the way, this is the gang which was killed by the police in an encounter in Kamra around 3 months back if anyone has been following the newspapers\n2) The other colleague was picked up in broad daylight near gondal.  Two cars stopped him and before he knew it there were guns pointed at him.  Again, ransom was paid by him for release.\n3) A local influential was picked up near Swabi interchange [i](he is an "Ilaqay ka Badmash") [/i]when three cars boxed him in. He got his hand on his gun at the same time a gun was pointed at his head.  One of the kidnappers took it away from his hand.  Again, released after ransom.  \n4) A cinema owner was picked up on the GT road while travelling with four armed guards.  The kidnappers created a choke point and car had to slow down.  When guards tried to retaliate, they were shot and the guy was taken.\n\nIn my case, I was chased on main GT road in broad day light.  Once I managed to lose them by going to 150.  The other time, I had to display my weapon, point it at them which slowed them for an instant allowing me to run away [i](didnt fire)[/i].\n\nI can relate hundreds of these incidents but the theme is clear.  AWARENESS is key.  Once the kidnappers have lost the element of surprise, you can get away.  Try not to open fire unless you are sure its not the police and by doing it, you might be able to get away.  Otherwise there is no point as if it comes down to a gunfight, you WILL lose against 6-7 guys armed with AK-47s and you with a machine pistol / shot gun.\n\nOne funny bit is, my colleague when he was being released, asked the kidnappers for advice on how to prevent it in the future and what they said was a) Never travel in night time and b) If a car is chasing you, never let it come alongside you because if it does, you are done for [i](since we shoot out the tires or shoot you)[/i]', 0, 1, '203.82.55.89', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 756, 16495),

The possibility of ricochet is one of the reasons for the common firearm''s safety rule "Be sure of your target—and of what is beyond it."\n\nI will quote two incidents of bullet ricochet that happened to people I knew. \n\nA Pakistani lawyer went to his friend’s place to check a handgun which he intended to buy, in the US. His friend handed him the gun. The lawyer cocked the gun and dry fired it towards a wall, believing that the chamber is empty. Like always, the empty gun fired and the bullet ricocheted off the wall and hit the lawyer’s wife, who was also in the room, in her neck and killed her. \n\nThe second incident involved my Diana air gun. My uncle aimed at a bird on a tree in neighbour’s front yard while he was standing in our courtyard. He pulled the trigger, the bird flew away and we heard human screams. We rushed to their house and found their son having a pellet injury in his left thigh. The rest is a lot of nagging and a ban on our touching guns.  \n\nThe ricocheting depends on number of factors: \n\nVariables\nThe likelihood of ricochet is dependent on many factors, including bullet shape, velocity (and distance), target material and the angle of incidence.\n\n\nBullet\nBullet construction has a major factor in determining both the likelihood of ricochet as well as where the bullet will travel afterward. Hard bullets have a greater tendency to penetrate than softer ones. Bullets that break up, such as varmint hunting bullets have a low risk of ricochet. \n\n\nVelocity\nRicochets are often more common with low power calibers such as .22 or .177 calibre, which can have trouble penetrating some materials, although a ricochet can occur with any caliber. Higher velocity projectiles have a tendency to either penetrate the target, and/or to break-up on contact with it.\n\n\nTarget material\nBullets are more likely to ricochet off flat, hard surfaces such as concrete or steel, however a ricochet can occur on almost any surface including grassed soil, given a flat enough angle when hit. Materials that are soft, give easily, or can absorb the impact have a lower incidence of ricochet, for example sand. Though it may not be obvious, bullets easily ricochet off water.\n\nAngle\nThe angle of departure, both vertically and horizontally, is difficult to calculate or predict due to the many variables involved, not the least of which is deformation of the bullet caused by its impact with the surface it strikes. Ricochets will almost always continue on a somewhat diagonal trajectory to their original trajectory, unless it is against a flat surface perpendicular to the angle of incidence (or approach), in which case, it will reflect at an angle dependent on the other variables involved in the ricochet incident.\n\n\nDangers\nRicochets are a common danger of shooting because after bouncing off an object the bullet that ricochets poses an ''unpredictable'' and serious danger of causing collateral damage to bystanders, animals, objects, or even the person who fired the shot. When the deformed projectile does hit a bystander or another target it can become very dangerous. Instead of cleanly traveling through the "body/object", the bullet can behave more like a hollow point bullet, causing a larger wound cavity, or even fragmenting and causing multiple wound channels.\n\nIn rare cases, ricochets can return to the shooter. This occurs when the object struck possesses enough resistance to withstand the impact of the bullet, and whose surface is perpendicular to the shooter. Some bullets are designed to deform at the nose, which is the main reason for the bullet ricocheting at such an extreme angle and returning in the shooter''s direction.', 0, 1, '58.27.227.115', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 838, 16684),

While you may wish to teach your child how to handle a gun at a time and place of your own choosing, remember that curiosity can sometimes get the better of a child. Keep your ammunition and weapons stored in separate, locked locations. \n\n[b]Use a gun lock.[/b] In many places, gun locks are now a legal requirement when you purchase a new gun. These are lock-and-key systems that physically prevent the trigger from being pulled. \n\n[b]Ask if your child''s friends have guns in the home.[/b] It''s your choice to allow or not allow your child to spend time at a house where there are guns. Either way, you should know the answer to this question. Maybe you support gun ownership, but your child''s friend lives in a home that doesn''t take the same safety precautions you do. You need to know what kind of access to guns your child might have - that''s the single biggest contributor to gun violence, accidental or otherwise. \n\n[b]Talk to your kids about guns.[/b] Again, no matter what your opinion about guns, educating your kids about gun safety is always good idea. Teach them a few key points, and revisit the subject often. Very young children should know simply to stay away. Older children need to understand the difference between television and real life, and how to resolve conflicts peacefully. \n\nMost important of all, you should always be a good role model. Teach kids to respect firearms. Make sure they understand these important safety tips, and keep the lines of communication open so you know what exposure your child might be having to guns elsewhere. People can differ philosophically on the issue, but safety needs to be a priority for all. Because no matter where you come down on the issue, there''s one thing we can all agree.\n\nSource:-http://life.familyeducation.com/gun-safety/politics-us/59180.html?page=2&detoured=1', 0, 1, '116.71.214.31', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 843, 16704),

The initial flight of the rocket is expected no later than 2014.\n\nThis type of carrier rocket deserves attention, as its advanced upper stage can be integrated with a CZ-5 carrier rocket to directly blast designated equipment to medium Earth orbit and geostationary Earth orbit, or even lunar orbit. The rocket is capable of deploying multiple satellites and has outstanding capability for orbit maneuvering and orbit transfer. It can function in orbit for seven to 10 days.\n\nThis advanced-upper-stage rocket is of critical importance for the People''s Liberation Army in its research of orbit transfers and orbital killer satellites. The advanced upper stage of the rocket has a diameter of 3.8 meters, and the thrust power of the engine is 35 kilonewtons.\n\nThe CZ-5 is likely to be deployed on Hainan Island, where conditions are favorable for the launch of satellites into geosynchronous or geostationary orbits. Most of the United States'' ballistic missile early-warning satellites and communications satellites are deployed in this orbit range. The CZ-5 is capable of sending a 25-ton-class satellite into low Earth orbit and a 12-ton-class satellite into geosynchronous orbit.\n\nBy the time the rocket is ready for launch, the quality of China''s image-reconnaissance satellite will have improved greatly.\n\nAt a weight of around 14 tons, it will be on par with the technological standard of the KH-12 image-reconnaissance satellite of the U.S. military.\n\nIn recent years, China''s export of space technology, including satellites and satellite-launching services, has been closely tied to its attempts to acquire natural resources globally. The LM-5D will put China in a more favorable position, capable of competing with the United States and Russia.\n\n[b]China''s sales of space technologies overseas have so far focused on its traditional allies, such as Pakistan,[/b] and oil-rich countries like Venezuela and Nigeria. On Oct. 17, [b]China signed a contract with Pakistan to provide a PakSat-1 communications satellite and launching service.[/b]\n\nThis is China''s third such foreign contract. It produced a communications satellite for Nigeria and launched it in May 2007, and it did the same for Venezuela with a successful launch in October 2008.\n\n[url]http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Analysis_China_reveals_new_super_rocket_999.html[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.233.61', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 16722),

[b]In a report, Forecast International asserted that MBTs from China, Pakistan and Russia would account for most of the market through 2018,[/b] Middle East Newsline reported. "In terms of sheer numbers, Forecast International expects [b]Pakistan''s Al Khalid[/b], the Type 98 of the People''s Republic of China, and the Russian Federation''s T-90 — including India''s licensed T-90S production program — to continue to dominate the market, representing 60.57 percent of all new tanks rolling out worldwide, and accounting for 52.28 percent of the value of the market, through 2018," the report, titled "The Market for Tanks," said.\n\n[b]Both Al Khalid as well as Type 98 have been offered to Middle East clients. In 2008, Al Khalid underwent trials in Saudi Arabia while Type 98 was presented to Sudan.[/b]\n\n"Last year, the Chinese Type 98 program maintained its position as the single largest new-production program," Forecast said. "Yet, with a total value of $395.79 million — for 116 new-production tanks — the Type 98 program was worth only about 27.11 percent what the U.S. DoD spent on the M1 Abrams in 2008."\n\nIn its annual analysis, the Forecast International Weapons Group, based in Newtown, Conn., asserted that the U.S.-origin Abrams and the German-origin Leopard MBTs would set the standard for the market. The report said the United States would spend most of its MBT budget in maintaining and upgrading the MBT fleet.\n\n"In the congested streets of Iraqi cities, the Abrams serves as a significant force multiplier, fully up to meeting the challenges of an asymmetric warfare environment," Forecast said.\n\nIn 2008, U.S. Defense Department contracted nearly $1.5 billion for the maintenance, reset and upgrade of the M1A1 fleet. Forecast said this marked more than 46 percent of the total value of all new-production main battle tanks entering the international market in 2008 — nearly $3.17 billion.\n\nIn all, more than 6,500 MBTs, worth nearly $27 billion, were expected to be produced through 2018. Forecast said modernization and retrofit would remain a significant component of the international market.\n\n"The expense associated with the modernization and retrofit of high-end main battle tanks pales in comparison with the prospect of new tank procurement," Forecast said. "Thus, FI expects new production of high-end tanks to remain relatively low, accounting for 14.9 percent of all production and 24.22 percent of the value of the market during the forecast period."\n\n[url]http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/ss_military0245_03_25.asp[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.225.226', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 17063),

Glock''s intial purpose is LE/Army, so it has to survive brutal treatments, water resistance, there fore as mentioned the main parts are mainly enclosed in the slider it self, the lower frame/receiver being made of polymer plastic is resistant to water and any other sort brutal treatment, also it does not rust.\n\nGlock designed it LE/Army intentionally, which means the when the user draws the weapon he draws it with the intent to shoot, so rather than having an external safety, its internally built within the trigger with a 2 - 5.5kg pull adjustment.\n\nAll the factors combined the make Glock an excellent combat firearm and very reliable.

"Carbine" Williams, he was convicted of bootlegging moonshine and sentenced to prison, in prison he incorporated the Jonathan Browning short stroke piston in a rifle which was much smaller than the M1 Garand rifle, when the prison warden found out he let him continue to make a prototype, he was released early, and hired by Winchester, and so came the M1 Carbine. It got its name from the inventor''s middle name.

They will only go away when their back office tells them to do so. \nI think they don''t even have authorization to shoot BGs or maybe just in the legs as a last resort. \nThe alarm signal is sent to the security company via phone line. You can get a 2 line option which will use whatever land line is free/working. Better still get a GSM option which requires a working SIM so it can send the signal even if your landlines are down/cut. \nAlso get a cordless panic button. It can be useful to have in your hand as you approach your gate from the inside or outside - that''s when many incidents happen.\nThe alarm usually sounds by mistake when someone in the household unknowingly opens a door/window while the system is armed. Or if the wind blows open an unfastened window. Or even some equipment fault.\nI noticed that we were very alert when the system was new but as we got used to the false alarms the alertness level also went down over the years.

We used to drive in and out of these roads, where they have other facilities as well, like the welfare club, swimming pools, tennis and squash courts, as well as the golf-club. However, there are two points, which cause me optimism: 1) 7mm wrote that he could help with memberships, thus there must be some provisions and exceptions for non-army personnel.2) The Captain of the range, during our chat, told me they already do have some members coming all the way from Islamabad and even Lahore. Who are these guys? Army personnel would not move this far for shooting facilities, they would have their own in their respective cities. However, lets see, how things unfold.

Irshaad!!! \n\n\nThe Man Rules  \nAt last a guy has taken the time to write this all down\n  Finally , the guys'' side of the story.\n\nWe always hear " the Rules " \nFrom the female side.  \n  Now here are the rules from the male side.    \n\nThese are our rules!\n1.   Men are NOT mind readers.\n\n2. Learn to work the toilet seat.\nYou''re a big girl. If it''s up, put it down.\nWe need it up, you need it down.\nYou don''t hear us complaining about you leaving it down.\n\n3. Sunday sports, It''s like the full moon \nor the changing of the tides.\nLet it be.\n\n4. Crying is blackmail.\n\n5. Ask for what you want.  \n\nLet us be clear on this one: \nSubtle hints do not work!\nStrong hints do not work!\nObvious hints do not work! \nJust say it!\n\n6. Yes or No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.\n\n7. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it.. That''s what we do.\nSympathy is what your girlfriends are for.\n\n\n8. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. \nIn fact, all comments become Null and void after 7 Days. \n\n\n9. If you think you''re fat, you probably are.\nDon''t ask us.\n\n10. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the  other way\n\n11. You can either ask us to do something\nOr tell us how you want it done. \nNot both.\nAnd if you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.\n\n12. Whenever possible, Please say whatever you have to say during commercials…. \n\n13. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we.\n\n14. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings.\nPeach, for example, is a fruit, not A color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.\n\n15. If it itches, it will be scratched.\nWe do that.\n\n16. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," We will act like nothing''s wrong. \nWe know you are lying, but i t is just not worth the hassle. \n\n17. If you ask a question that you don''t want an answer to, Expect an answer that you don''t want to hear.\n\n18. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really .\n\n19. Don''t ask us what we''re thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as rugby , windsurfing or surfing (not golf).\n\n20. You have enough clothes..\n\n21. You have too many shoes.\n\n22. I am in shape.  Round IS a shape!\n\n23. Thank you for reading this.\nYes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight;\n\n\nBut did you know men really don''t mind that? It''s like camping. \n\n\n\n\nCLOSE UP sa daant saaf karain.......\n\nPEPSODENT se mazboot karain.......\n\nCOLGATE    sa     fresh   karain .......\n\nAgar phir bhe white na hon to,........

This prevents entry of moisture into the cartridge and also prevents the removal of the bullet by accident.  Finally the lacquer coat also helps to provide a very limited amount of lubricant for the bullet as it goes into the barrel as well as corrosion protection.  A lot of manufactures use a clear lacquer that is not visible, but I think that most of them add a lacquer coat simply for the reasons mentioned.\n\nYou will also find green/blue/red lacquer around the primer area, again to protect it against moisture effects.  This especially so the case with the Russian brands which were designed for adverse conditions.  Have also seen this on some Knocchi cartridges.\n\nFor example, the red box chinese 9mm ammo all have clear lacquer on their primers, but the newer batch of white box 9mm chinese ammo have a green. \n\nBullets do not have marker lines on them.  Their seating level is checked by the overall length of the ammo cartridge, confirmed by a die.  Bullet lengths vary based on their weights and composition.  \n\nThe load in a specific cartridge is by weight in grains of gunpowder.  In a factory setup this is done automatically, but again based on weight of gunpowder per cartridge [b]FOR THAT LOAD.  [/b]\n\nYou can increase the velocity and power by increasing the amount of gunpowder in a cartridge to some extent...the limitations are the space available and the ability of your firearm to handle extra pressure as well as the ability of the case and primer to handle that extra pressure.  That''s why (for example) the 9mm, 9mm +P and 9mm +P+ are all the same overall length.\n\nBTW, WD-40 will have no effect on the bullet, cartridge or the primer.  These cool dudes have tested it quite thoroughly:\n\n[url]http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/bot39.htm[/url]\n\nIts a very informative website, would urge all members to check it out.\n\nHaving said that, IMHO its best to keep your ammo as grease/wd-40/oil free because it will attrach dust.  Here in Karachi we have a lot of dust, and dust is not what you want going into your gun.

Its basically a cheaper made 500 and the main visible difference is that it has a cross bolt safety (on the trigger guard) unlike the 500 which has it on the tang (like a double barrel shotgun).  My point is that if you want a pump shotgun for HD, the maverick should be good enough as it is based on the 500, and has a pretty good reputation as an economy pump.  \n\nThe Turkish guns are nice, but they don''t have the longer term reputation that the Mossbergs do.

It has been used at times heavily and other times has been left alone for a couple of years with no care.

There is a reason why people recommend the Mossberg 500 or the Remington 870 as HD shotguns.

In fact, with his permission, I even took the liberty of firing away a mag of my 9mm, in the status of a non-member! Anyhow, I had promised a report on my visit over there, which unfolded interesting opportunities! However, I wish to start by answering some of the most frequent asked questions of our members, before I elaborate on membership procedures/opportunities.\n\n 1) The club has so far only 129 registered members, has facilities for Skeet/Trap shooting as well as .22 rifle shooting and handguns shooting. Its located in wonderful greenery and I believe it is covering nothing less than 20-25 acres, next to the local Golf Club.\n\n2) Membership is mostly of Army personnel, coming from different parts of the country, but even non-army civilians can apply. The Captain told me he would be supportive with this, but more on this in my subsequent paragraphs. \n\n3) They don''t yet have lady members, but ladies/family can accompany and sit in their covered sheds and watch the events. \n\n4) They only, as 7mm reported, have arms for V.I.P personnel. Thus you must bring your own firearms. \n\n5) There is no restriction as such on the calibers of your handguns, they just must be licenced. People do use 9mm''s over there. Prices of ammo as 7mm reported, a pack of 25 of No.7 12 gauge shells @ 175, skeets@ Rs.3. Handgun ammunition not available over there, you must bring your own. \n\n6) They don''t have any appointed instructor as such, but the Captain himself does offer his assistance with minor things. Course, he has more to take care of over there.\n\n7) There is no Cafeteria over there, but there is a nearby store from which ordinary refreshments can be ordered. \n\n8) The expended ammunition can be paid for on the spot, or by depositing some amount in an account, and be deducted from there. Fees, as 7mm reported, 10000 in security deposit for life-time and a minor monthly fee.\n\nNow, to come to the membership procedures. Well, basically, it sounds very simple. You fill up their membership registration forms, have it endorsed/ recommended by 2 club members, signed/attested/recommended by your local S.H.O( For non-government servants), attach your photograph, deposit your security in advance with a bank assigned by the club, and then wait for acceptance. How long? Well, that''s the question. In some cases for months, and in cases with references about 3-4 weeks. Yet more on this in the next paragraph, Where I would like to draw the attention of Respected brother, Abbas.  \n\nI was there both for my personal requirement, as well as a non-official represantative of Pakguns. As far as my single membership is concerned, that would not be too troublesome, and I will secure it, Inshallah, soon. However, as far a larger number of members is concerned, the Captain during our talks, suggested me a wonderful option. He said that instead of applying for memberships individually, it may possible for him to allow a larger number of Pakgun members, a quoata type arrangement, if we, I mean Pakguns, could do a bit of donorship/Contribution to the club, in forms of supplying the club with some required items, like more plastic chairs, they only had around 8-10 of these by the sheds, watercoolers, sunshades/umbrellas, plastic tables, etc, as a goodwill gesture by Pakguns! This sounded good to my ears, and I told him I would discuss this with my fellow members and our site owner. In fact, he even went to the extent, that we could have our contributed items labelled with the name of our site, Pakguns, and yield a good deal of advertisement for our site! What do you guys say, you wanna have Pakguns advertised over here? This a place visited by high-profile people and would definetely increase our own memberships, too! Thus its a double deal, we would get both easier memberships, as well as PR for our site. I invite a discussion on this, and that''s why I posted this topic as a separate issue, coz it''s more Wah specific than Rawalpindi/islamabad as in the original thread of this issue. I think a debate on this and further working would prove very benefical for our Islamabad/Rawalpindi/Peshawar based members.

The individuals that I bought for breeding were soooo aggressive that we had to use artificial methods for impregnating a female. (The male & female used to start fighting once they were let loose. Once I had a couple who were locked together from both front & rear lol) \n\nMost of the animals that came out were strains and not impressive at all.\n\nAfter 7 years of trial & error, what came out was ALARMINGLY Hound of Baskerville. LITERALLY. Almost all of my friends have seen that litter grow up and some of them shudder.\n\nResults were .\n\nThey were 3 in the glossiest jetblack. There were 7 in total but the mother killed 4 of them.\n\n As tall as a great dane, broad like a mastiff and fast like a Kohati bull terrier. By fast I mean very very alert & agile. They had soo muscular bodies that you could actually see triceps & biceps. LITERALLY.\n\nThey were overly & excessively agressive and very very strong. At 10 days they were literally fighting with each other in the most aggressive manner. If you try to pick them up they would bite you. By the time they were 4 months it was impossible to come near them or keep them together or with another animal so each one of them was put in a seperate enclousure with enough space. All tries to have them disciplined were futile. They would only let their handler or me come near them or pet them. When put on a leash they hand a mind of their own. You try to pull them or something answer came in the form of a bite. \n\nOne of them literally killed Punjab Champion bully in less than a minute and mawled his handler (he got 57 stitches) when he tried to get him off the dead bully. He was shot then & there.\n\nOut of the remaining two one of them died of maggots when he hurt himself biting the steel cage all the time and it was impossible to administer medicine.\n\nThe last one was involved in an incident that I regret to date and was put down. \n\nI do have notes for the breeding program and plan on doing it again once now that I have resources to sustain one.\n\nI think do have pictures of them which I will post.

Now, about M1Carbine"s questions, first. Look, Ka_Khan rightly and reasonably pointed out that our contribution to the club can only yield us priority based memberships. It is naive to think that in this area, we would be able to evade the normal procedures of membership registration! Membership in this club is not granted to anybody, who comes in and fill up the forms, deposits his security amount and then takes his membership as granted! You have to have your sources right, and you have to arrange your recomendations. Still, it will take its due time. An agreement with the management over here could spare us the complexities in this process, not the proces itself! As far as your security gate question is concerned, there is a simple way to get in. Present your membership card, and your driving licence. Obtain the entry slip and leave the gate. On your way back, collect your licence, Nic, etc from the same gate. Now lets move on to the picture question.                                                                                                                                                                                              As far as taking pictures is concerned, it may be possible with permission, but I don''t think it would serve any specific purpose. We also cannot expect that every single pakgun member should come first and weigh his willingness to contribute, if we decide on contribution/donation procees, after getting a formal agreement with the management over here by presenting a writ offer/application through the captain of the range. Instead, I would deem a visit by our executive, Abbas Bhai, as well as a few other senior members like Firepower!, Ka_Khan, Balazona,  just to mention a few of our respected brothers, would and should be the all final say in this matter. If the site is okayed by these seniors, its o.k for all of us. Pictures cannot describe much, and you would really need a vide angle for this photography! Finally, as regards the captain Mr. Nasir Khan''s membership to this site, I can ask him to visit the site as a guest, but still it would be up to him to oblige, if it is of any interest to him. I don''t think he would come forward and discuss these things with us on the line. Neither can he take the decisions regarding our memberships solely by himself. He can only be supportive, if we reach to anything with him, and he can present the matter to the management in a supportive manner. That"s it. Yet, I am confident he could get us good results. I must add, that it would be a wrong perception in anyone''s mind that P.O.F Shaheen is a club in NEED of any donations/contributions. It is infact part of a very wealthy estate! They wouldn''t need any contribution as such. This was only supposed to be a gesture of goodwill and kind of a CBM, from our behalf in order to obtain easier and larger scale memberships.

Only when zoomed in, you observe the lines of the TT, yet the gun is really worth looking at, not to say worth having in TT lover''s collection. As you know the Zastava M57 was a regular sidearm of the army of the former Yugoslavia. What I like most about the Zastava, apart from the certain different lines and grooves on the top-side, which you don''t see on the chinese version, is actually the rock solid grip on the gun, owing to increased length of the magazine. This is especially beneficial for small and medium sized hands, coz the magazine protudes from your handgrip on the lower side and you can hold the gun more solidly. However, back to the LUX version. I once in Germany saw this gun displayed in a weapons show, and lately found it again on the net.  Have asked various dealers about its availability and even requested for special order import, before I finally went for the 9mm, but the dealers over here did not even know about its existence.

Very pretty and futuristic to look at the pistol come in with piccadaly rails for LAM modules. Safety features are flawless. The pistol will not fire a chambered round unless the magazine is inserted. The firing pin is blocked in safety mode although the trigger/hammer mechanism is active and will dry fire without the firing pin getting activated in safety mode. The second safety is with a key like in the Steyr M9A1.\n\nP22 fires with a loudest bang & the biggest muzzle flash if compared with other .22LR pistols and has threaded barrel for a suppressor. \n\nWith three dot sights it is very accurate. We (Me & Imran) tested it at the range with CCI 32 grain HyperVelocity rounds at 25 yards.\n\nPls note that we had feeding problems and the pistol is ammo picky (Magnum rounds recommended) but again this was the first time we were firing it so it might require some breakin, for now therefore only recommended for plinking, sporting and not for SD/HD, until I get my 1000 rounds through it.\n\nAbout mechanics & components, the slide is sintered metal with a steel breechface insert and the barrel is rifled steel inserted in another steel barrel (barrel within a barrel).\n\nHere goes the eye candy\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss143/III-666/21042009523.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss143/III-666/21042009524-1.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss143/III-666/21042009525.jpg[/img]\n\nThreaded Barrel for Suppressor\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss143/III-666/21042009527.jpg[/img]\n\nTried the .22LR CCI 32 Grain Hollow Point Hypervelocity rounds with this pistol at 10 yards on three 1, 1.2, 1.5 inch wood planks.

Prior to the imposition of the ban, the Sindh Home Department had issued as many as 85,000 licences in the past five years.\n\nAfter the lifting of ban, a large number of political workers of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) visited the department for the issuance of arms licences on home minister''s quota, the source said, adding that an increase has been recorded in sales and purchase of arms from authorised dealers, which had now reached an alarming stage," he said.\n\nAccording to the source, a large number of people have been visiting the department with applications in their hands, which are approved by Sindh Home Minister Dr Zulfiqar Mirza. "A race has started amongst the activists of different political parties in the province for possessing licensed arms," he said. The source said it seemed that the home department had suddenly turned into a licence-issuing factory for legal arms. He said: "Now it has become a routine matter that the department would receive a list of successful candidates recommended by Dr Mirza".\n\nHe said a number of people from interior Sindh also visited the department. These people, the source added, carried with them the letters from the MNAs and MPAs of their respective areas. "Most of the licence forms, which were received by the department, made claims for providing security to the MNAs and MPAs of the area concerned," the source said.\n\nThe source said: "The department has issued licences to private security guards of many MPAs and MNAs of Sindh owing to prevailing law and order situation in the province, but many of them are not strictly using their licensed weapons for the purpose mentioned in application forms".\n\n"Many fire arms acquired through licences are used for confronting political rivals," the source said.

I think one set comprises 4-6 chairs, and I believe these are available in good quality and fair price from METRO stores. One such set, and around 8-12 ordinary plastic chairs. Such a set with Pakguns ad on the top of the cannopy, as well as ads on the back of chairs, like Pakguns transparent water stickers would really look cool over there. If somebody could check the prices from METRO, otherwise I may be doing it in coming days. And, instead of ordinary watercoolers, I think one refrigerated water dispenser with a 19ltr bottle would make a good contribution. In rough estimate, I think the garden set should be around 16-20k, 8-12 chairs around 8-9k, the water-dispenser around 8-10k. This comes to roughly 32-38k. I don''t know about the lights. Maybe a horizontal iron rack, around 10 feet wide and with 8-10 powerful spotlights mounted on it, could do the job, perhaps just 4 corner-stands with one 500-1000w rods would be sufficient, I don''t know, but this should not cross the 10k mark. Additionally, we could have imprinted on papers some of those beautiful targets for handgun-shooting that we already have and even offer regular supply, if they like it. Moreover, a few dozens of Pakguns p-caps for their members. I think this would make a good package. Yet, before we venture on, let''s first collect our members. How many are we, seeking membership over there? We must be at least 10-15 for a start. This much of an effort for 4-5 members would not be at its'' place, as 4-5 members can always apply individually.
