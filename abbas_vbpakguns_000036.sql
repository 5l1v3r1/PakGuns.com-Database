Bluing also has the advantage of creating the right surface texture to retain oil thus ensuring protection if properly maintained. Almost all blued weapons are hot blued when manufactured. Normally the parts are bathed separately and then assembled together. Mechanism parts such as springs, pins etc are normally not blued, hence the point of the process damaging the mechanism might be incorrect. \n\nComing back to your original query about restoring a dbbl barrel, may i suggest look around the different workshops of gunsmiths and see their work, hot bluing if done correctly can last, only problem is finding the right guy.

I guess one only pulls err squeezes the trigger to shoot?? Isn''t it so[/quote]\n\nGoP was Invoiced 575 USD each for the Glock 17.', 0, 1, '203.81.233.109', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2976, 75427),

WW II Buffs will find this interesting. Even after 62 years (and a little tinkering), they were able to fire up the diesel engine!\n \nA Komatsu D375A-2 bulldozer pulled the abandoned tank from its tomb under the boggy bank of a lake near Johvi , Estonia . The Soviet-built T34/76A tank had been resting at the bottom of the lake for 56 years. According to its specifications, it''s a 27-ton machine with a top speed of 53km/hr.\n \nFrom February to September 1944, heavy battles were fought in the narrow, 50 km-wide, Narva front in the northeastern part of Estonia . Over 100,000 men were killed and 300,000 men were wounded there. During battles in the summer of 1944,  the tank was captured from the Soviet army and used by the German army. (This is the reason that there are German markings painted on the tank''s exterior.) On 19th September, 1944, German troops began an organized retreat along the Narva front. It is suspected that the tank was then purposefully driven into the lake to conceal it when its captors left the area.\n \nAt that time, a local boy walking by the lake, Kurtna Matasjarv, noticed tank tracks leading into the lake but not coming out anywhere. For two months he saw air bubbles emerging from the lake. This gave him reason to believe that there must be an armored vehicle at the lake''s bottom. A few years ago, he told the story to the leader of the local war history club ''Otsing''. Together with other club members, Mr. Igor Shedunov initiated diving expeditions to the bottom of the lake about a year ago. At the depth of 7 metres they discovered the tank resting under a 3 metre layer of peat.\n \nEnthusiasts from the club, under Mr Shedunov''s leadership, decided to pull the tank out. In September of 2000 they turned to Mr. Aleksander Borovkovthe, manager of the Narva open pit company AS Eesti Polevkivi, to rent the company''s Komatsu D375A-2 bulldozer. (Currently used at the pit, the Komatsu dozer was manufactured in 1995, and has recorded 19,000 operating hours without major repairs.)\n \nThe pulling operation began at 09:00 and was concluded at 15:00, with several technical breaks. The weight of the tank, combined with the travel incline, made for a pulling operation that required significant muscle. The D375A-2 handled the operation with power and style. The weight of the fully-armed tank was around 30 tons, so the active force required to retrieve it was similar. A main requirement for the 68-ton dozer was to have enough weight to prevent slippage while moving up the hill.\n \nAfter the tank surfaced, it turned out to be a "trophy tank" that had been captured by the German army in the course of the battle at Sinimaed (Blue Hills) about six weeks before it was sunk in the lake. Altogether, 116 shells were found on board. Remarkably, the tank was in good condition, with NO RUST, and alll systems (except the engine) in working condition. This is a very rare machine, especially considering that it fought both on the Russian and the German sides. Plans are underway to fully restore the tank. It will be displayed at a war history museum in the Gorodenko village on the left bank of the River Narv.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1F7POA][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1F7POA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1F81hi][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1F81hi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1F8dL0][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1F8dL0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV1knVAr][img]http://s4.postimage.org/1knVAr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV1ko23S][img]http://s4.postimage.org/1ko23S.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1F8xI9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1F8xI9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1F8CHr][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1F8CHr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1F8HGJ][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1F8HGJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV1koSrS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/1koSrS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1F8U9r][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1F8U9r.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV1kpgoi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/1kpgoi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1F987i][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1F987i.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV1kpAlr][img]http://s4.postimage.org/1kpAlr.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '111.92.128.205', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3004, 75518),

My mission is to educate the prospective Mossberg and Maverick gun buyers not to be ripped off by the local dealers. Pay right price for the gun. You should know what you need to pay approximately, when you go to buy a good quality Gun.  This may affect my business in a negative way that if you give the target price to the dealer,  he may persuade you to buy Turkish Gun instead of Mossberg or Maverick, where he makes more profit. There are plenty of  Turk companies in the business, however, my recommendation will be to buy a Pak made gun rather Turkish. Will you believe if I tell you in Turkey they make most parts of the guns in homes. Darra is much better organized.  I deal with Berretta as well but I feel it highly priced for Pakistani market.\n\nWe sell lot of Mossberg and Mavericks to Middle east countries too. Even a small country like Lebanon buys about 2000 every year.   Mossberg makes about 2000 every day and are yet have a backlog of  120 Days.

Copy of your CNIC\r\nb). Two Passport size photographs\r\nc). Filled out form (Available at [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/armsform.pdf[/URL]\r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]COST:[/B][/U]\r\n\r\nCost of the licenses vary from city to city with Islamabad being the cheapest. Approximate rates for major cities are:\r\n\r\n1). Islamabad = Rs. 13,000\r\n2). Lahore = Rs. 14,000\r\n3). Karachi = Rs. 15,000\r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]TIME:[/B][/U]\r\n\r\nTime for getting a license varies depending on your dealer''s agent but generally it does take about 30 to 40 days. An efficient agent can get one made within two weeks, a less connected agent will take two to three months. \r\n\r\n\r\n[B][U]AMMO LIMIT:[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nThe standard ammunition limit on MOI N.B.P licenses is 100 rounds per year. This limit is also the maximum amount of ammo you can legally carry with your weapon. Ammunition limits can also be enhanced with an application to MOI along with reason for request example sport shooting etc. More commonly is it done though dealers who charge about Rs. 2 ruppee per bullet increase. i.e getting it increased to 500 bullets a year will cost you Rs. 1000. I strongly suggest doing so as 100 bullets a year is useless for any enthusiast or sports shooter. \r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]VALIDITY:[/B][/U]\r\n\r\nMOI licenses are valid for 5 years from date of issue, after 5 years renewal is required which is a simple matter of paying fees for the next 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]LEGAL LIMITATIONS OF A MOI LICENSE:[/B][/U]\r\n\r\nThe MOI license is all Pakistan which means you can transport and use your weapon legally in all provinces of Pakistan. This is unlike provincial licenses which are only valid within the province issued, so as soon as you leave the boundaries of that province the weapon becomes illegal. \r\n\r\nAll other rights/obligations/status of both kinds of licenses are the same. \r\n\r\n\r\n[B][U]144 Status and MOI[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nMOI licenses get no special treatment during imposition of Section 144. Don''t ever carry your weapon on your person during it, it will get confiscated if found. If you need to carry one, then go to your provincial home department and ask them to issue you a 144 permit. If however you are not carrying but rather transporting your weapon (to the range, to another city etc) during 144 then unload your gun and magazines and put them and your ammunition in separate locked bags in your trunk and have your license handy for any checking. There is no ban on transportation of unloaded weapons. Loaded weapons which are ready to fire and carried on the car or on person are problematic during 144.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]I GOT MY LICENSE, NOW WHAT ?[/B][/U]\r\n\r\nWhen you get your new license you have 30 days from the date of issue to register it in the main branch of your local National Bank of Pakistan branch. For example in Lahore it is the one on Mall Road, next to GPO, in Isb it is in Aabpara.\r\n\r\nThe bank official will register your license in his computer and file, write the N.B.P registration number on your license and sign and stamp it. This is usually done on the first page of the book. A date stamp is also applied.\r\n\r\nNext you have a six months or in rare cases a three month grace period to purchase your weapon. This can be found on page 10 of your MOI book.\r\n\r\nWhen you find and decide on your weapon of choice then simply go to a firearms dealer, present your license and he will make an entry of the gun serial number on it, along with his dealer stamp and date. He will also give you an original sale receipt of the purchase. \r\n\r\nYour last step is presenting your license along with original sale receipt to the D.C.O office within 30 days. They will keep the original receipt, make an entry into their computer and return your license stamped saying your weapon has been registered with them. Ideally your license should be returned the same day and cost nothing but in pursuit of ''Chai Pani'' your perfectly valid firearms license will get stuck and take forever unless about Rs. 300 to 500 is presented to the lower staff to move things along.   \r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]My license says "One N.P.B", What does it mean ?[/B][/U]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne N.P.B stands for One Non Prohibited Bore weapon. In a nutshell you can buy any semi automatic pistol or revolver on the market, any pump action or semi automatic 12 Gauge shotgun or a .22 rifle. In some cases like Sindh the Provincial Government there also allows Bolt action rifles in other calibers like 7mm.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]MOI License Verification:[/B][/U]\r\n\r\nGenerally with the N.B.P registration and the D.C.O office, you really don''t need anything else. Just MAKE SURE YOU DO THESE TWO THINGS YOURSELF. Licenses that come stamped with N.B.P and or D.C.O are suspicious and probably fake.\r\n\r\nFor the more paranoid, you can call MOI and follow their guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]Recommend Dealers / Agents: [/B][/U]\r\n\r\nFor the time being we are [B]not [/B]recommending any dealers or agents. I would suggest checking out our dealer review section for guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]How to Transfer A Gun from One License to the Other:[/B][/U]\r\n\r\nThis is a simple procedure. Take both licenses and the firearm to a registered firearms dealer and ask him to transfer the gun from one license to the other. He will do it for you and also give the buyer a sale recipt. Dealers charge around Rs. 1000 for this service. The buyer will have to deposit his license to the D.C.O office like normal for registration of the new weapon. The seller must also keep in mind that if he''s buying another weapon on the same day then no procedure is required, if however he buys a weapon at a later date then he will have to ask his dealer to send his license to the D.C.O office for extension, that costs around Rs. 500/1000 and takes a few days. There is no grace period of even a single day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[B]Here is the form for Grant of new Arms License[/B] [B]:[/B]', 0, 0, '119.154.71.51', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3020, 75851),

(67113, 2289, 0, 'Abbas', 1, '', 1257067951, 'Salams, a lot of the friends that come here to PakGuns are relatively new to the world of firearms and are thinking about or have recently got a new license and are looking for the right right gun to buy for their SD or HD (Self Defense, Home Defense) needs. Many new threads are opened everyday about the topic and it gets repetitive and the information becomes less useful over time. \n\nI would like to suggest a couple of guns for the first time users in various price ranges and a mini one line review of the suggested firearm. Details and discussion on any of them can be found by clicking the search button on our panel bar and typing the desired gun name i.e Glock or CF98.\n\nTo start off with I would like to say that the most important thing when keeping a gun for self defense is knowing how to use it properly. All guns are useless and counter productive if the shooter does not have a reasonable level of proficiency in the use of the firearm. Proficiency only happens by firing atleast 200 to 300 rounds in a controlled environment like a range and at a target. Once you are hitting a head size target at 10 to 25 feet you are good to go since in 90 % of the cases that is the maximum distance your gun will be used for defensive shooting.\n\nMost people new to firearms do not understand what calibers are and what difference it makes. In a nutshell calibers are difference sizes of bullets, .22 being small, 9mm being average and .45 being large.  The difference it makes to [b][u]New Users[/u][/b] is that generally the larger the bullet, the higher the recoil and lower the accuracy of the second shot. I suggest selecting 9mm as a caliber for your defense needs. It''s like Goldilocks porridge not too hot, not too cold and just right ;) \n\nIn the world of firearms and defense the most important thing is reliability and all the weapons listed here have proven their worth by multiple tests. Ofcourse the more you spend the more reliable firearm you will get. \n\n\nIn 9mm there are several guns available in the market in varying price ranges. A suggested few are:\n\nIn the Rs. 30,000 price range there is the [b]CF-98[/b].\n\n[img]http://www.leverarms.com/Pistol%20Images/Norinco%20CF98.jpg[/img]\n\nIt is made in China and is a decent medium size light weight gun. It is quite accurate and probably the best you can buy around Rs. 30,000.\n\nIn the Rs. 45,000 price range, your options open up quite a bit and there is the [b]CZ 999, the Canik 55 and the Stoeger Cougar 8000.   [/b]\n\n[b]CZ 999:[/b]The CZ is a great gun, extremely accurate and well made. You cannot go wrong with it. It is a high quality copy of the SIG 226 pistol which retails for around Rs. 350,000. It is made in Serbia. \n\n[img]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/cz999-2.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Canik 55:[/b] This is my personal favorite. It''s a clone of the CZ75 B and is the most accurate sub Rs. 100,000 pistol I have ever fired. Very high quality copy. Made in Turkey. I got mine for just under Rs. 40,000.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik552.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Stoeger Cougar:[/b] Probably one of the most discussed pistols at PakGuns, this pistol is very highly regarded by all for it reliability and size. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Canik555.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Taurus PT 99[/b]. If you are a fan of Beretta and large shiny objects appeal to you ;) I suggest looking no further than the PT 99 by Taurus. It is one of the best pistols of the world in any price range. Very high quality piece and one of my favorites. I have shot over 4000 rounds though my pistol and it''s still brand new. Very accurate too. The only drawback is the size, it is a large frame pistol and not really comfortable to carry around. Very highly recommended. Price Around 54 K.\n\n[img]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/taurus_pt99.jpg[/img]\n\nApart from these guns, nothing in my opinion can be justified because of the insane prices. The only gun that I would recommend spending more money on is either the Glock 17 or the Glock 19. The 17 sells for around Rs. 225,000 currently and the 19 for Rs. 250,000. The difference between the two is that the 17 is larger and more accurate and the 19 is smaller and slightly less accurate than the 17. The reason you pay a much higher cost is reliability and durability. Glock is absolutely the most reliable handgun in the world and it will last multiple lifetimes.\n\n[img]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/glock17.jpg[/img]\n\n\nA closing note on magazine capacity ammunition type and durability.\n\nBoys will be boys and every manufacture that makes products aimed at men will stress "more is better" but that is not necessarily always the case. Although a 20 round magazine will get "wow''s" from your friends, more rounds in your magazine will make your weapon larger and heavier. For most situations you do not practically need anything above 13 or 15. Infact that is excessive as well, what you can''t do in the first 5 shots you aren''t going to do in the next 20. So if the handgun you are choosing has a magazine capacity of 13 or 15 you are good to go. If you feel you need more rounds, then that''s what the extra magazine is for. \n\nAmmunition type. For target shooting and practice you use normal 9mm rounds which cost around Rs. 35 (POF, CHINESE). For Self defense however you use "Hollow Points". These bullets are specifically designed for defensive purposes and will expand upon impact thus having a higher probability of knocking your target down. They cost around Rs. 65 to Rs. 250 depending upon make. I would suggest atleast firing a box of 50 rounds of hollow points though your gun to make sure they work well before loading your magazines with them.\n\nDurability. Most people will go on and on about barrel life and forging technology and yada yada. Yawn.... :rolleyes: \n\nA gun will last "FOREVER" if maintained properly. You must clean your gun within 24 hours of use or it starts to get damaged. Barrel life is nonsense and is of no concern to 99 % of the people. Ammunition is so expensive that if we take the CF 98 whose barrel under the worst conditions still lasts 3000 rounds then that means you fired about Rs. 100,000 worth of ammunition though a Rs. 30,000 gun. Not very probable, if someone has that much money to spend on ammo then I''m sure they will buy a better gun first.\n\nAnd last but not least remember that if you own a firearm you are a grownup and a responsible individual. Anger, Machoism and Irresponsible behavior have no place in the life of an firearm owner. Before you own firearms these three things should be ingrained in your psyche. \n\n\n1). EMPTY OR LOADED, NEVER EVER POINT YOUR GUN AT ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DESTROY.\n\n2). ALWAYS ALWAYS KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER TILL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THE TARGET.\n\n3). NEVER CARRY/USE A GUN UNLESS YOU NEED TO.\n\n\nHope this little write up helps all our new brethren to the wonderful world of Firearms !

Same with AK47 round, marked as 7.62x39mm but actual bullet diameter is 7.92mm.\n\nOn local notes: 12 bore here in localized lingo is a reference to 12 Gauge, which has nothing to do with bores.

It is just like how two kids learn to balance a cycle and start pedalling it in a straight path instead of falling to either side :)\n\nThe practice you mentioned is a well practized one, used to realize a shooter why he/she is putting off bullets from intended aim point. Once you realize it then you can emilinate this issue. Its good you have visualized the biggest enemy of accuracy.. i.e jerking the trigger and eventually the firearm itself. We need to open up our eyes and relax our body in harmony to the functioning of the firearm. In other words, let it function the way it is supposed to.\n\nI personally did what..? I ended up with above mentioned counselling to myself.. I managed(with a lot of practice) to DELAY my flinching habbit. i.e the shot went off, u witnessed the muzzle jump/flash.. OK now do what you do best.. FLINCH !! I started off with this... while doing the same on later stages, I found myself not even flinching at all after a couple of rounds, say 10 rounds in a firing session.. That is when the pleasure comes in... You feel real good when you see newly evolving holes in the paper on every bang that you trigger out. Further practive will do the trick... you will learn the cycling sooner or later but dont stop trying :)\n\nRegards', 0, 1, '119.152.22.2', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2452, 75880),

My Regards to all who have been bringing so much knowledge to us all!\nThe gauge of a firearm is a unit of measurement used to express the diameter of the barrel. Gauge is determined from the weight of a solid sphere of lead that will fit the bore of the firearm, and is expressed as the fraction of a pound (e.g. a 1/12th pound ball fits a 12-gauge bore). The term is related to the measurement of cannon, which were also measured by the weight of their iron round shot; an 8 pounder would fire an 8 pound (3.6 kg) spherical cast iron ball and had a bore diameter of about 91 mm (3.6 inches).\nCommonly used today in reference to shotguns, though historically it was also used in large double rifles, which were made in sizes up to 4 bore during their heyday in the 1880s, being originally loaded with black powder cartridges. These very large rifles, sometimes called elephant guns, were intended for use in India and Africa for hunting dangerous game.\n\nSizes in use\n\nCertain sizes are more common than others; 12 gauge is the most common size, with up to 50% of the overall shotgun market in the United States. The 20-gauge shotgun is popular with shooters who are uncomfortable with the weight and recoil of a 12 gauge gun, and is popular for upland game hunting. The next most popular size is the .410 shotgun, which is not a gauge but a caliber. 10, 16, and 28 gauges, while less common, are still readily available. Shotguns larger than 10 gauge are rarely manufactured nowadays. 8 gauge is rare due to its abolition in the United States because of its prohibition in duck hunting. However, it is still used in many parts of the world (notably: Britain) for bird hunting. Its shells are usually black powder paper cartridges as opposed to the plastic/wax cartridge and smokeless powder of today. \nMust remember in the nomenclature of any ammo (9 x 19 MM) 9 denotes ''First fig'' denotes caliber and ''2nd Fig'' refers to the length of cartridge case.

In case of the .303 the bullet Dia is .311 inches again about .008 inches bigger than bore dia the russian rounds are .310 to .311 and the land dia is .303.\nActually the Americans define their calibers in inches, the British give the cal in inches and give it a name, the Germans give in mm x case length and a name .\nBut all of them breach the norms and here and there copy each other like the US 7mm Rem mag.

Hence the caliber is the BORE DIA from LAND TO LAND[/quote]\n\nSir I am really enjoying this discussion, very valid concern you just put up, that the actual bore when made in the barrel is what that tranforms to the LANDS. ok and as per your point, it translates to the caliber of the weapon.. I hope I got you correctly. I agree.\n\nNow lets take the example of .308 caliber rifle. Height of each groove is .004 inches which makes total height .008 inches. Thus bullet fired through this barrel is .300(as its a .30cal weapon) + .008inches(Land height) = .308inches, THEN exactly WHY every 308 weapon is marked *** Cal. 308 *** on it. Why dont they mark it Cal. 30 on it. Because the caliber is 30, because the bullet that fires through it is 30 cal. (though in reality it fires a .308 bullet, when measured, its called .308caliber, as caiber is measurement of the projectile) \n\nSecondly, mostly in U.S the caliber is supposed to be the diameter of BORE, in rifled barrels both in long guns and handguns i.e land to land dia of barrel. At this point we dont consider that, however this caliber as per gun literature, can be given in terms of bullet, land, or even groove diameter. U.S caliber specifications are not consistent therefore.Just to confuse matters, even in the same country the quoted calibre does not always indicate the true bore diameter but measure the diameter of the "outer" barrel. i.e from groove to groove. (good example are .308 Cal weapons)\n\nSir what I think or personally prefer is, logically the caliber must always denote the groove to groove dia of barrel. As the bullet that passes through a given barrel is cut and wrenched by the lands of barrel. It is literally squeezed though and spitted out from muzzle. So actual caliber of a weapon must be in concordance with the bullet being fired from it...\n\nSir, the confusion is still there, most of the gun literature is already admitting it. We can only use caliber in generalized terms therefore and stay away from its hoopla. Waiting on your comments to approve it.', 0, 1, '119.152.61.24', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3015, 75955),

They can manifest similar results (and just not just poor accuracy).\n\n[u]Flinching[/u] is most often manifested in an almost whole body pre-shot negative reaction to the the shot:  the shooter blinks or closes his eyes, he tightens a bunch of muscles (hands, shoulder''s push forward to get the gun further away), maybe even turns his head away from the gun.  [u]Flinch is manifestitation of fear of the shot being fired.[/u]\n\n[u]Jerking the trigger[/u] is a beginner who sees the sights wobbling about.  Then the sights settle and when the sights look about perfect the shooter yanks on the trigger.  The shooters intent is to make the gun go bang when he sees the sights about perfect.  The problem is [u]the shooter induces more error when he yanks on the trigger then if he just pressed the trigger smoothly through the sight wobble[/u].\n\n[u]Pre-ignition push[/u] is the shooter anticipating recoil and mistakenly believing he can reduce the muzzle flip or recoil.  The shooter pushes against the gun in some way (with the heel, squeezes the hands tighter or tightens the wrists).  The difference between the Preignition Push and flinching is the reason of the action.  This is a macho he-man thing.  A version of "I don''t want the gun to flip around for I won''t let it."  The result is poor accuracy.  It is better to form a table platform for shooting and not worry much about the recoil.

A .38 S&W is .358 in but the inventor thought of ommitting the `5` as in those days only two numbers were used for hand gun calibers and also the inventors were busy developing calibers in the .35 dia and since 9mm is .355 in and the .357 is .357 in, the earlier . 358 the inventor just picked up the last digit. I read about the .358 bieng called a .38 for this reason.\nA .44 magnum is actually .429.  The .45 is actually .452 and the list goes on.\nA 7mm is also known as .284, also known as .280 and again as .275 H&H. When one falls in love with all this one straight away knows what name means what exactly.\nTechnically the caliber is just the Bore Diameter, but when we take the full name we instantly know the  cartridge case case behind the bullet its dia, velocity and maker. Like a .280 Ross, a 280 Remington, a 7mm Mauser, a 284 winchester, a 7mm weatherby Magnum, a 7mm Remington Magnum, a 7mm Mashburn Magnum, and a dozen more.

He was leaving his home, headed to his store when he unintentionally dropped his handgun. The handgun is a Taurus PT111 9mm Millennium, which he bought in 2004. He had the handgun loaded, with a round in the chamber, with the manual safety in the "on" position. It was also secured in a nylon holster with a strap. When the handgun fell, it struck the concrete floor with the butt of the gun. It discharged, striking the plaintiff in the upper thigh. The projectile travelled in an upward direction, through his abdomen and into his left lung. He suffered serious internal injuries, which included losing his spleen. The first police officer on the scene found the handgun with the manual safety in the "on" position. Once the handgun was photographed and taken into evidence, a fired (spent) shell casing was found in the chamber of the weapon. This was crucial evidence, because the manual safety on this model handgun locks the slide and prevents the rearward movement of the slide if the handgun discharges. This helped prove to the jury that the manual safety was in fact on at the time of the unintended discharge. Also, the manual safety has absolutely nothing to do with preventing an unintended discharge from dropping (if you can believe that). The defect in the handgun is the internal striker block (internal firing pin block). This is supposed to prevent the movement of the striker (firing pin) if the gun is exposed to a sharp impact (such as a drop). We actually were able to record on video a PT111 firing a primed case when dropped in a similar manner to our facts. The jury found that a defect existed and returned a 500k compensatory verdict and a 750k punitive verdict. Plaintiff had roughly 71k in specials.\nThere are still over 100k of these guns on the market. It will happen again if Taurus chooses not to do a recall. Taurus PT140''s and PT145''s have the same internal striker block mechanism. It is my belief that they will also discharge if dropped.\nThanks for the inquiry.\nM.

They can manifest similar results (and just not just poor accuracy).\n\nFlinching is most often manifested in an almost whole body pre-shot negative reaction to the the shot:  the shooter blinks or closes his eyes, he tightens a bunch of muscles (hands, shoulder''s push forward to get the gun further away), maybe even turns his head away from the gun.  Flinch is manifestitation of fear of the shot being fired,\n\nJerking the trigger is a beginner who sees the sights wobbling about.  Then the sights settle and when the sights look about perfect the shooter yanks on the trigger.  The shooters intent is to make the gun go bang when he sees the sights about perfect.  The problem is the shooter induces more error when he yanks on the trigger then if he just pressed the trigger smoothly through the wobble.\n\nPre-ignition push is the shooter anticipating recoil and mistakenly believing he can reduce the muzzle flip or recoil.  The shooter pushes against the gun in some way (with the heel, squeezes the hands tighter or tightens the wrists).  The difference between the Preignition Push and flinching is the reason of the action.  This is a macho he-man thing.   I don''t want the gun to flip around for I won''t let it.  The result is poor accuracy.\n\nSo which are you doing?\n\n1) Are you flinching because the report of the gun scares you? (nothing to be ashamed of- it nature to flinch from an explosion feet away from your face)\n2) Are you jerking on the trigger? (a very common error)\n3) Are you trying to stop recoil?

It was designed by Winchester and first marketed early 1895 as one of the calibers available for the Model 1894 lever-action rifle. The original loading used a 160-grain softpoint bullet and 30 grains of smokeless powder. Muzzle velocity was 1970 fps. It was adopted to the Winchester Model 54 bolt action as well as various dressed-up versions of the original 1894 action such as the Models 55 and 64. Marlin chambered it in their Model 1893 lever action and the imoroved 36. The latest Model 336 also available in 30=30 (this has a different breechbolt than previous models). at one time, the savage Model 99 lever action was made in 30-30, and they also chambered their old Model 40 bolt action for it as well Model 340. Mossberg''s lever action was available in 30-30 as was H&R''s Tpper single shot utility gun. The Remington rolling block and Wincherter single shot were also at one time available in this caliber. In europe, the 30-30 is known as 7.62x54R and is popular in single shot and combination guns. In 1979, Remington announced the  30-30 Accelerator load that featurs a 55 grain softpoint .224-inch diameter bullet retained in a 7-grain plastic sabot. Muzzle velicity is listed 3400 frs. This is intended strictly as a varmint load.\r\n\r\nThe 30-30 has long been the standard Aerican deer cartridge, and it is still the yardsrickby which the performance of all others is compared. To say that a cartridge is in the 30-30-class means that it is suitable for ane in a largey game up to and including deer at moderate ranges. Its popularity is due in a large measure to the fact that this cartridge has always been available in short, light rifles or carbines. It is extremely popular  used in Mexico and throughout Latin America. So much so, in fact, that in many back country areas, the treinta-treinta is the only high-powered anyone knows or has ever heard of. It was, and to a large extent still is, the most popular and widely used small-bore sporting cartridge. Despite this popularity, the 30-30vis no wonder cartridge with regard to accuracy or killing power. It does its best work with the 170-grain bullet at ranges of 100cto 150 yards. Although sometimes reloaded with light bullets of 80 to 110 grains, it has neither the velocty nor accuracy in most rifles to make a very good varmint round. Despite its faults, it is a perfectly adequate deer cartridge if properly used by a good shot. The new Accelerator load will allow those with rifles accurate enough to take advantage of it the opportunity to use the old 30-30 as an off-season varmint rifle.', 1, 0, '115.186.117.230', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

An explosion produces light, sound and blast (rapidly expanding gasses)   As a result the gun makes a loud noise.  There is a flash or flame.  The gun recoils.  Some people perceive this recoil to be violent.  Sometimes shooters are introduced to large caliber guns when they are young.  Sometimes the shooters are not wearing hearing-protection over their ears or eye-protection over their eyes.  \n\nAll of these things (noise, flame, recoil) can frighten a shooter- a frightened shooter flinches.  The shooter will squint or close his eyes to protect his eyes from the explosion.  The shooter may turn or duck his head to protect his eyes or ears from the loud noise.  The shooter may tense up in antipication of shot being fired and the recoil.\n\nThe shooter is afraid.  \n\nNow fear is natural and not a bad thing.  Respect and understanding are better.  The shooter has to learn that they will not be harmed when shooting the gun, but should respect the harm unsafe handling of a firearm can do and understand how to avoid harming himself or others with the firearm.\n\nOvercoming flinching out of fear can be accomplished through several training activities:\n\n1- Use a low caliber firearm to start. \n2- Use a long rifle instead of a handgun.\n3- Make sure the shooter is old enough.\n4- Wear hearing and eye protection.\n\nIf you want to scare a shooter into a long period of poor shooting, hand an 8 year old a .44 magnum revolver to shoot their first time and don''t give them eye or hearing protection.\n\nIt was common practice to introduce your son to shooting by hunting squirrel or plinking at cans with a .22 short or even a BB gun because the recoil was very mild.  The long barrel put the flash and bang (if any) far from the shooter.  With eye and hearing protection the report (sound of the shot) was very soft.\n\nWithout any distracting noise, flash and blast, the shooter could concentrate on proper marksmanship.\n\nAn instructor or friend can look for signs of flinch:  The more extreme the fear of the explosion the more pronounced the behaviors.  I''ve already cover the majority of those.  Subtler evidence of flinch or fear is the squint, tightened facial muscles (a grimmace) and white knuckles.  One can also look for a "jump" or flinch when someone else shoots nearby.  If someone unexpected shoots behind the shooter and he startles, he probable is flinching when he shoots himself.', 0, 1, '144.160.98.31', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2452, 76305),

The shooter understands that perfect sight picture makes for a perfect shot.  It is true that on a properly functioning gun the bullet lands where the sights are pointed.  So, when the sights settle and when the sights look about perfect the shooter then yanks on the trigger.  \n\n[u]The shooter has not yet learned that while sights are important, the manipulation of the trigger is more important.[/u]\n\nThe shooter''s intent is to make the gun go bang when he sees the sights about perfect.  The problem is the shooter induces more error into the allignment of the sights when he yanks on the trigger then if he just pressed the trigger smoothly through the wobble.\n\nThe wobble makes for a small error.  The shooter would have a tight group centered on the bullseye if he smoothly pressed on the trigger ignoring the minor wobble of the front sight.  The variation in the sight allignment is very minor compared to the extreme variation in sight allignment caused when a shooter jerks on the trigger to make the gun go bang.  \n\nViolently jerking on the trigger causes a major variation in the sight''s allignment (for a right handed shooter is is most often down and to the left).  The shooter has a gross pattern of shots all over the place, not centered on the bullseye, and often a line of shots low and left from the bullseye.\n\nJerking on the trigger is the most common error.  \n\nLearning to manipulate the trigger properly can be accomplished as follows:\n\n[u]1- It''s a self control thing.[/u]  The shooter has to resist the urge to pull quickly on the trigger when the sights look perfect.

They believe they can stop the muzzle rise/flip or the push rearwards.  \n\nIt might be possible for a very thick boned, large tendoned, very muscular man to stop the muzzle flip and recoil, but few of us match that description.\n\nHowever, since during the recoil the gun can''t be fired, why should we endeavor to stop the muzzle flip?  It''s about ego, macho display and poor understanding of the energies and actions involved in shooting.\n\nWhen the shot is fired, the gun-powder burns and produces a lot of gas which expands.  It creates pressure which dislodges the bullet from the case and propels it down the barrel and out.  These same gases are also pushing back against the case and breach face of the slide (in a hand gun).  The gases push the slide rearward unlocking it, taking it "out of battery" and you can''t shoot at this time if you wanted (there is no loaded cartridge in the chamber and the gun is "out of battery.")\n\nThe slide continues rearward extracting the case from the champer, compresses the recoil spring, and the ejector strikes the rear of the case forcing it out of the gun.  \n\nYou still can not shoot the gun at this time\n\nThe slide is forced forward by the energy in the compressed spring, it picks up a cartridge from the magazine and forces it into the chamber and locks the slide back into battery.  (During this slide movement and reseting of the trigger certain parts of the internal mechanisms related to the trigger, hammer or striker were reset as well)\n\nNow, and only now, after all of these things have taken place can you shoot again.\n\nThe energy in spring will counter the energy of the recoil and bring the gun right back to the place from which it started without you having to do much of anything.  Your job as the shooter is to firmly grasp the firearm providing a stable platform from which the gun will do it''s part.\n\nThe problem is when we as shooters start thinking we are smarter than the guys who engineered the gun.  We aren''t (most of the time).  We are the tool user.\n\nWhen we think we can shoot faster by stopping recoil we cause problems.  Most of the time that problem is called the pre-ignition (pre-shot) push.  The process of fire, extract, eject, and feed completes in about .05 to .07 of a second.  So what you are attempting to do is put the right amount of pressure against an action that completed in the blink of the eye... does this seem wise or even possible?\n\nInstead of being able to time the resistance to the recoil most people resist EARLY- Before the shot is fired.  The shooter pushes against a shot which hasn''t happened yet and moves the sights off the target.  Then the shot is fired and the shot misses.\n\nStopping preignition push is a self-control issue.\n\n1- Stop thinking or even wanting to stop recoil.  Though too little control over the gun is also a bad thing.  Pre-ignition push is more common.  Grip the firearm firmly, that is all.  Let the gun do it''s cycling thing and it will come right back to it in battery position from which it began.\n\nWatch this first person view of shooting.  \n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psIEXmVAgZM[/url]\n\nThe firearm is stationary, the shot cycles the slide (it rises some pushes rearward a little bit) and then the slide goes back right to the place from which it started.

The only difference is that there is no cat."\n\n"One had to cram all this stuff into one''s mind for the examinations, whether one liked it or not. This coercion had such a deterring effect on me that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year."\n\n"...one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one''s own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought."\n\n"He who joyfully marches to music rank and file, has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action. It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder."\n\n"A human being is a part of a whole, called by us _universe_, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."\n\n"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."

It''ll cost you 5k. It has that click click type of adjustment screws and my experience is that IF the mounts are of reasonably good quality and secured properly, you will not need to re-zero it again even after going through a whole box of pellets (250). This scope has inner illumination buttons which highlights the aim in green as well as yellow colors. Takes two lithion cells. You can use this scope effectively on a .22 rifle as well.\n\nNow, regarding the mounts, the first set that I purchased from Hussain sucked big time and I went to him again, complained and he then gave me another set but of a much better quality. Those mounts cost me 1.5k.\n\nHowever, I got another set of similar mounts (as a spare) from Rotorcrafts (a member of PG) who sent them to me via courier for 1k including courier charges. He''s got more in his stock and I suggest that you get the mounts from him instead of Hussain. Only if Rotor is out of stock, then go for Hussain. Search out Rotor''s topic/post regarding mounts here at PG, it''ll also give you some good info.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBy the way, I do not recommend a tasco scope for Gamo.

I believe if u have a "show worthy" shotgun to begin with then u should stick to wood cause its show worthy and u''ll probably show it off more then using it or it''ll become another cabinet queen for ur friends to see but not touch. however if u have a gun that sees significant use in the field/range (for every type of hunting) then I would only recommend polymer cause it can take serious abuse and doesn''t require any maintainance. hey! if u run out of shells u can use a polymer stock to paddle ur boat out of a pond. same advise for budget guns, if its a budget gun then stick to polymer. odds are u''ll probably crack the wooden buttstock or the forend will start rattling before any serious ammo count. i''m talking from experience.', 0, 1, '203.99.53.47', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3023, 76786),

Guns have different lengths of trigger pull (some are longer than others).  A shorter trigger usually has a shorter reset as well.  Reset is the distance you have to release the trigger back forward after shooting in order for it to reset and become ready to fire another shot.\n\n[u]Polish[/u]:  Triggers are also rated on how smooth they are.  A good trigger is not "rough" - the metal parts glide smoothly over each other and do not catch, are not rough or ragged.  No hitch or catch.\n\nNo matter how heavy or long a trigger pull is, the trigger should always be smooth and polished.\n\n"Soft" might best describe a trigger that is lighter, shorter, and smoother.\n"Hard" is most likely to describe a long, heavy trigger.\n\n"Gritty" triggers are just plain nasty.\n\nSoft Trigger Pros: Lighter triggers with shorter length and good polish can be fired more accurately and faster than longer, heavier, grittier triggers.  The less energy you put into a gun to press the trigger and fire it, the less likely you are to disturb your sight picture.\n\nSoft Trigger Cons: Lighter triggers can more easily be accidentally fired.  In the US, some criminal prosecutors have attempted to use a light triggers as evidence of the intent to kill. \n\nHard Trigger Pros: A heavier weight and longer pull means it requires more deliberent intent to shoot the gun.  This reduces the chance of an accidental discharge.\n\nHard Trigger Cons:  The heavier weight and longer pull is harder to shoot more accurately and a bit slower.', 0, 1, '69.155.117.39', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3044, 76808),

I bought it Locally through a dealer and I had to wait about 10 days for the delivery as it was a custom made as a special order. The normal clone that goes for around 22k was not to my satisfaction as the dealer  had shown me that when I first went there. So after my questions he offered me this piece. I blindly trusted my instincts as our family deals with all the arms through them so I didnt hesistate and gave the order. \nI was very happy to see this top quality and I was stunned by the fninishing and quality to every single detail. Its amazing how they can make a copy so perfect. I will however ask the dealer where was it made as he didnt tell me and I didnt bother to ask. You wont be able to get this as a daily retail item because normally no one wants to pay around 30k for a local handgun. I dont mind as its not hat expensive. If you buy a beretta 92fs CO2 airsoft pistol from the UK or USA it cost the same price around 30-35k pak rupees. So for that price I am getting a 9mm. I have no problems with its firing and its addictive to fire trust me on that. The recoil is un-noticable and its way lighter than the other clones in the market.\n Spend your money wisely. I didnt buy an original one as its 4 times more money in Pak whereas you can get it for $500-$675 in the USA so its over priced way over head. \nI hope it will have answered some of your questions .\nThnks...Immy', 0, 1, '116.71.175.35', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2949, 76870),

Idrees Taj''s post (quoted below), this piece is being made by Salamat, Fazal and a few other known factories and are available in Lahore Neela Gumbad Market at 22k (asking price).\n\nSo if it is readily available in Lahore retail market, then my question is whether it is possible to have a piece ordered through a Karachi-based dealer. In any case, I have a scheduled visit to LHR early Feb and if something doesn''t work out by then, I would be contemplating bringing one from LHR. \n\nI already have a purchase finalized with one of PG''s senior members for a Taurus PT 92 AFS SS 17+1 with rails NIB, however, having a total of three MOIs in the pipeline, I would be seriously interested in going for this clone too. \n\nBy the way our Admin Abbas posted a great strip-down comparison between a Taurus PT 99 and this particular clone earlier this year and posted the images as well. Its a great comparison and can be reviewed here [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=111[/url] .\n\n[quote=midreestaj]dear its quality piece in local 92s.. latest 92 clones which are of greatest local made quality has currently incorporated the light weight build feature(use light weight alloys) which is not considered in the medium quality 92 clones. The best beretta made is Pakistan can be recognised by its light weight, clear like real marking on both sides of slide, and nice original looking serial number markings over the aluminium frame(which is copied from M9s and American 92FS and unlike the Italian 92FS). They also are peculiar by the shallow modern type of rifling and bore is kind of polished smooth. \n\n[b]However this type of best Pak made 92 costs around 22K first asking price at Lahore neela gumbad market. Basically the gun is a 20K clone being gently and honestly sold at 22K. No higher quality clone availble to this one please note. These are from Salamat, Fazal and a few other known factories. [/b]\n\nKAC clone specifically talked much on this forum is actually a good/medium clone however, range is 18-20K by the words of an honest gentleman dealer. Worst clones are also available for 15 or as less as 12K. \n\nPrices asked as 24/25/27/28 K are all seller''s tactics to earn more profit on this 20K firearm.

The blue finish is cheaper as I mentioned for 20-22k depends where you settle. I just believe that one should buy things locally even if you have to pay a little more. For instance, if there is something wrong with the item you purchase its such a hassle to drive ti lahore and maybe a few trips where you would end up spending more money on your commute. I would spend 2k on petrol each trip so its not worth it. The dealers have the right to make a litle bit of profit wont you agree. I didnt bother to go into details and bargaining. I am sure he would have given me a little discount lol maybe 1000 or 2000 the most but sometimes if you pay what ws demanded then you get better after sales service. This is just my opinion. I am new to guns and dont mind admitting it. Once you live in the west you dont really have any urge to use firearms and the licencing is not that easy either. So in Pakistan you can atleast fulfill your interest when it comes to firearms. I had initially also looked at taurus without the hammerhead in islamabad when I got my licence and it was retailing for 56k but I wasnt really happy with it as it had a pin not a hammerhead as the beretta. The beretta was quoted to me over 200k so I passed as after I go back my 9mm would be sitting in the closet so not worth spending that much.

I and so many other members have mentioned prior and currently that the better clones are over 25k in SS finish and the balck ones are cheaper. Make sure you get what you pay for and paying a few more thousand wont hurt , rather than going back n forth to the dealer for any problems. When something is expensive there is a reason behind it but we fall for lower quality just because it was cheaper. The cheaper the item more likely it will fall apart. With a normal cheap clone no dealer will offer you a lifetime warranty as I did becasue they are sure that the special order guns have to be made according to the customers standards not with cheaper materials.

It''ll cost you 5k. It has that click click type of adjustment screws and my experience is that IF the mounts are of reasonably good quality and secured properly, you will not need to re-zero it again even after going through a whole box of pellets (250). This scope has inner illumination buttons which highlights the aim in green as well as yellow colors. Takes two lithion cells. You can use this scope effectively on a .22 rifle as well.\n\nNow, regarding the mounts, the first set that I purchased from Hussain sucked big time and I went to him again, complained and he then gave me another set but of a much better quality. Those mounts cost me 1.5k.\n\nHowever, I got another set of similar mounts (as a spare) from Rotorcrafts (a member of PG) who sent them to me via courier for 1k including courier charges. He''s got more in his stock and I suggest that you get the mounts from him instead of Hussain. Only if Rotor is out of stock, then go for Hussain. Search out Rotor''s topic/post regarding mounts here at PG, it''ll also give you some good info.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBy the way, I do not recommend a tasco scope for Gamo.

Taurus 24/7 is advertised as DAO (double action only) which means when you pull the trigger it will cock the striker first, then release the striker to fire the pistol; both actions, two actions, double action.\n\nThe second strike capability will allow you to reset the trigger if the cartridge is not fired and then pull the trigger again to cock the striker and then release the striker again in an attempt to fire the cartridge which did not fire the first time.\n\nI believe this to be a mixed blessing.  Pulling the trigger alone is certainly faster than performing remedial action and pulling the trigger.  But, if you pull the trigger a second time and the gun does not go bang a second time, you have wasted the time.  In a life or death situation this is a gamble. \n\nYou may get that cartridge to fire faster than performing remedial action and pulling the trigger.  Or you may not and still have to perform remedial action and pull the trigger.\n\nFor range shooting it''s a nice feature.  If the ammo you are shooting is of poor quality and you have a failure to fire, you can pull the trigger again and make certain that round is a dud.  But it is not a necessary feature.\n\nIn a fight for your life it may or may not work to your advantage.\n\nMy belief is that when the gun goes click and not bang you should do the proper remedial action- slap up on the magazine to ensure it is seated, rack/cycle the slide to exject what maybe a bad cartridge and feed a fresh cartridge into the chamber for firing, then determine if you still need to shoot.

I myself use a FabArm side folding, pistol grip shotgun for HD. I find moving around my house with a long full stock shotgun a little uncomfortable specially when I''m opening doors holding it in a ready to fire position and going around corners.\n\nThat said, I keep the shotgun primarily for outside use. For indoor I have weapons in various different places in three different calibers loaded with 9mm HP''s, .45 HP''s and .357 Mag HP''s.\n\nFor best bet for home defense is, have steel grills in all windows of your house and have solid doors with alarm sensors on them. A switch connected to one or preferably two really loud hooters installed is very much recommended. \n\nIf you detect some burglary activity in your house and you have your family accounted for, arm yourself, lock yourself and your family members inside and set the hooter on, also call the police and as many relatives and friends living close by as possible. Meanwhile fire one or two shots out the window to make additional noise. I suggest firing the warning shots before setting off the sirens.\n\nPlease remember, that the best defense is not to have to engage the intruder at all rather he runs away at the prospect of a fire fight and being discovered / caught.\n\nOfcourse nothing beats having a SMG like a MP5 handy ;) If you have one, everything else is just backup.', 0, 1, '119.154.76.173', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3000, 77381),

However, as far as snap caps are concerned, and judging from initial comments of fellow brothers, seems like not a very futile project in pure business terms, majorly because of low demand as well as low output price, and partially because only few people really care to use these. Yet, for fun''s sake or for promoting the project outside the limits of PG, I cannot say. Here it seems the boresighters may do better, coz of much higher prices, even if demand low, and less or near to equal input cost.

In real life, I''ve yet to see a guy (non exhibition shooter) who could succesfully hit the broad side of a barn using a pistol grip shotgun. trust me, shotguns are no cone of death. they require aiming and closer the distance (to the target), the requirement of precise aiming increases.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.151.151', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3000, 77505),

Only objective responses are invited. Please avoid ''good post'', ''nice topic'' type of replies.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Preventive Measures for Home Defence[/b]\n\nAny discussion about having a firearm in your home has to start with the security and burglary-proofing measures you have taken to prevent having to use the weapon in the first place. A weapon needs to be the last line of your defence. Your security measures should include the following:\n\n1) Properly secured/affixed grills on all house windows. But not at the expense of locking yourself in the house and without any alternate exit in case of need;\n\n2) Good quality locks on all doors which give access to the house;\n\n3) Properly secured and solid door frames;\n\n4) Habit of checking all doors/locks before going to bed. Recite Aital Kursi;\n\n5) An adequately loud hooter (preferably two) installed in a manner which cannot be easily tampered with or disabled (concealed wiring preferred) and which can be activated from multiple places inside the house. Loud enough to wake up neighbours from deep sleep. Car anti-theft alarm button (panic button) will be of additional use. The hooters can also be connected with bright lights which will flood important places of your house with bright lights.\n\n6) One secure room (safe room) with steel door and lock system which should be extremely difficult to break into, where all family members can be gathered safely.\n\n7) Memorized, easily accessible emergency LEAs numbers, pre-fed into your cell phone memory.\n\n8) At a minimum, a good quality intercom (preferably with video cam) with automatic switch to open main gate. CCTV is preferable.\n\n9) Drills to practice your response in such situations. Involve your family also in this. Let your neighbours know what the alarm sound means and what should they do in such a situation. Identify vantage points for yourself in the house. Check the time taken to secure whole family during such drills.\n\n10) Keep the minimum required valuables at home, that too preferably divided in two places. Keep the rest in safe lockers available at various banks near your house.\n\n11) Be extra vigilant while opening the main gate / door to exit enter the house. Tell your family members (particularly young kids) to exercise the same vigilance. Avoid entering/exiting the house if you have suspicious people near the gate. Especially while coming from airport / bank / locker, be extra wary while entering your house.\n\n12) Be cautious of unknown car near your house / in your lane. Also be cautious of unknown person(s) loitering near your house / in your lane. If they stay their for long. Take someone along and ask them who they are and what they''re doing here.\n\n13) Consider getting a guard dog if appropriate.\n\n14) Keep your HD weapons accessible and preferably not all in one place. But well OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. Try not to keep unsafe weapons like TT in your house. Preferably, get an electronic safe with keypads near your bed. Currently they are cheap and easily available all over the country. At the time of need, you should be able to access your HD weapon within 30 seconds.\n\n15) Occasionally let off a few rounds so that people in the area know that the occupants of this house are armed.\n\n16) Let your neighbours know that you are and will be there for them in time of need, so that you can expect the same from them.\n\n17) Continuously seek Allah SwT''s protection.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInvite other members to add and contribute.', 0, 1, '61.5.135.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3071, 77557),

(68683, 2329, 68679, 'Salahuddin Ayubi', 997, '', 1257487849, 'Before you even consider getting a weapon for "home defense," there are a few issues you must take into consideration.\n\nI''ll begin with a story.\n\nAhmed grew up in the streets of Quetta. His father was a Masters in Philosophy and an Afghan veteran who survived the Afghan war. In the neighborhood where Ahmed was raised, weapons were a part of life. You had them, you carried them, and you used them. Amazingly enough one of the first lessons Ahmed was taught by his father had to do with responsibility of your actions:\n\n"Don''t carry a weapon unless you are willing to pull it. Don''t pull it unless you are willing to use it. Don''t use it unless you are willing to kill with it. And don''t kill unless you are willing to spend the rest of your life in prison -- or die."\n\nThis philosophy was ingrained in him. From the second you picked up that weapon and put it in your pocket, you knew this was not a game. It was life and death. And you made that decision calmly and rationally. With a weapon, you were operating to a higher standard because the repercussions were far worse. When you have the ability to take a life, you cannot give into to momentary impulses and whims of ego. Now, granted, in the heat and passion of youth, that standard was not always met. With age, maturity and professional experience, the wisdom of that saying proved true to Ahmed again and again.\n\nIf you have a weapon you have to abide by higher standards. And meeting that standard is pretty much what our aim should be.\n\n[b]Keeping a gun in the house[/b]\n\nI honestly do feel that the greatest danger of gun ownership is ignorance. Ignorance, however, is a multidirectional problem. A significant part of that problem are children and teens. Children because they don''t know the danger of guns, and teens because of the danger of lack of emotional control.\n\nA bigger problem is adult ignorance about the danger of guns and children. Telling your children not to touch a gun is simply not enough.\n\nSince you must hold yourself to higher standards of conduct when you have a firearm, it behooves you to know exactly what these standards are. Training will show you exactly how complicated this subject is and destroy many of the myths about guns that you have. More importantly, it will show you potential problems that you never would have thought about on your own, but are legitimate firearm issues.\n\nWhat follows are a few suggestions about keeping guns in the house.\n\nDoing it right will cost you money and be ready to spend it on necessary training and safety. That is because I do not treat using a gun as a "what if" , but a "when it happens" issue. This is not to say that if you buy a gun you will automatically shoot someone -- in fact, I pray that never happens.\n\nAs I have stressed, owning a gun is a matter of responsibility. If you have the power, you must also understand the consequences of its use. That is why buying a gun should never be an "if I have to use it, I''d..." mindset, but rather a "since I now have the ability, I better know what is involved and protect myself against possible mistakes and the aftermath of its legitimate use."\n\nPrepare, over and above the cost of the gun, to pay for training, equipment and storage.\n\n[b]Hiding a gun is not enough. [/b]\n\nSome people honestly believe that their children do not go through their rooms and that hiding a gun would be enough. Unfortunately, the number of children who shoot themselves or others every year disproves this idea. Kids go through their parents room, accept that as a fact of life. And by accepting that fact, you can save a child''s life, possibly your own child''s.\n\nDo not think that by simply hiding a gun, or keeping the clip out of it you ensure your child''s safety or that teenagers won''t find it or, when emotionally upset, won''t get and use it. That is a high price to pay for an assumption.\n\n[b]Home defense vs. collections[/b]\n\nA gun for home defense needs to be immediately accessible. Hunting and sport shooting collections do not.\n\nSafes, locking cabinets and trigger guards are recommended for firearms that are not specifically purchased for home defense. Not only will they protect your collection from theft by burglars, but it will restrict access by emotional teens. (And BTW, keep the key on your keychain and with you. Hide a spare if you must, but don''t tell the kids where.)\n\nUnfortunately, these safety measures, totally undermine a gun''s usefulness for home defense.\n\n[b]For home defense[/b]\n\nUntil some of the high tech safety measures gun manufacturers are working on become readily available, I recommend electronic gun safes. They are rare and require some searching in order to find, but they are well worth it. These safes are keypad-controlled (on the better ones, the keypad is illuminated for night). When the combination is punched in, they swing open.\n\nThere is no fumbling with safety guard locks or searching desperately for your keys in the middle of a crisis. They are wall mounted next to your bed and unobtrusive. On the better ones, they will automatically lock down if three attempts to hack in are made. Thereby preventing a teen from sitting there punching in numbers to find the combo.\n\nThese safes allow the fully loaded and functional gun is accessible within seconds to someone who knows the combination and safely protected from teenagers, children and burglars.\n\nNote for the paranoid: If you are the sort who feels that you must have guns scattered around the house and be accessible no matter where you are, we have only one bit of advice: Quit doing whatever you are doing that makes it likely someone would come ''gunning'' for you. It''s amazing how far that will go to lessening the chances of someone kicking in your door and charging in with guns blazing. If it''s that bad of a neighborhood, move.\n\nTrain your children in firearm safety. Guns have a mystery about them. They are exciting and forbidden. They have an ambiance of danger and excitement.\n\nThat is until you are subjected to drawn-out, mind-numbing, repetitive training and lectures on gun safety. There is nothing so exciting and interesting to a teenager that having to go to school won''t bore them to tears over. Get membership to a decent shooting range and take them along and have them lectured by a professional trainer.', 0, 1, '61.5.135.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3071, 77561),

This nick deserves it.\n\n[b]Sultan Salahuddin Ayubi[/b], the hero of hundreds of battles, was the person who for twenty years braved the storm of the Crusaders and ultimately pushed back the combined forces of Europe which had come to swarm the Holy Land. The world has hardly witnessed a more chivalrous and humane conqueror.\n\nThe Crusades represent the maddest and the longest war in the history of mankind, in which the storm of savage fanaticism of the Christian West burst in all its fury over western Asia. `The Crusades form'', says a Western writer, `one of the maddest episodes in history. Christianity hurled itself against Muhammadanism in expedition after expedition for nearly three centuries, until failure brought lassitude, and superstition itself was undermined by its own labour. Europe was drained off men and money, and threatened with social bankruptcy, if not with annihilation. Millions perished in battle, hunger or disease and every atrocity imagination can conceive disgraced the warrior of the Cross''. The Christian West was excited to a mad religious frenzy by Peter the Hermit, and his followers to liberate the Holy Land from the hands of the Muslims. `Every means'', says Hallam, `was used to excite an epidemical frenzy''. During the time that a Crusader bore the Cross, he was under the protection of the Church and exempted from all taxes as well as free to commit all sins.\nPeter the Hermit himself led the second host of the Crusaders comprising forty thousand people. `Arriving at Mallevile, they avenged their precursors by assaulting the town, slaying seven thousand of the inhabitants, and abandoning themselves to every species of grossness and liberalism''. The savage hordes called Crusaders converted Hungary and Bulgaria into desolate regions. When they reached Asia Minor, they, according to Michaud, `committed crimes which made nature shudder''.\n\nThe third wave of the Crusaders commanded by a German monk, according to Gibbon, `were comprised of the most stupid and savage refuse of people. They mingled with their devotion a brutal licence of rapine, prostitution and drunkenness''. `They forgot Constantinople and Jerusalem'', says Michaud `in tumultuous scenes of debauchery, and pillage, violation and murder was everywhere left on the traces of their passage''.\n\nThe fourth horde of the Crusaders which had risen from western Europe was, according to Mill, `another herd of wild and desperate savages... The internal multitude hurried on the south in their usual career of carnage and rapine''. But, at last, they were annihilated by the infuriated Hungarian Army which had a foretaste of the madness of the earlier Crusaders.\nLater the Crusaders met with initial success and conquered a major part of Syria and Palestine, including the Holy city of Jerusalem. But their victories were followed by such brutalities and massacres of innocent Muslims which eclipsed the massacres of Changiz and Hulaku. Mill, a Christian historian, testifies to this massacre of the Muslim population on the fall of the Muslim town of Autioch. He writes: `The dignity of age, the helplessness of youth and the beauty of the weaker sex were disregarded by the Latin savages. Houses were no sanctuaries, and the sign of a mosque added new virulence to cruelty''. According to Michaud: `if contemporary account can be credited, all the vices of the infamous Babylon prevailed among the liberators of Scion''. The Crusaders laid waste to flourishing towns of Syria, butchered their population in cold blood and burnt to ashes the invaluable treasures of art and learning including the world famous library of Tripolis (Syria) containing more than three million volumes. `The streets ran with blood until ferocity was tired out'', says Mill. `Those who were vigorous or beautiful were reserved for the slave market at Antioch, but the aged and the infirm were immolated at the altar of cruelty''.\n\nBut in the second half of the 12th century, when the Crusaders were in their greatest fury and the emperors of Germany and France and Richard, the lion-hearted king of England, had taken the field in person for the conquest of the Holy Land, the Crusaders were met by Sultan Salahuddin Ayubi, a great warrior who pushed back the surging wave of Christianity out to engulf the Holy Land. He was not able to clear the gathering storm but in him the Crusaders met a man of indomitable will and dauntless courage who could accept the challenge of the Christian West.\nSalahuddin was born in 1137. He got his early training under his illustrious father Najmuddin Ayub and his chivalrous uncle Asaduddin Sherkoh, who were the trusted lieutenants of Nooruddin Mahmud, the monarch of Syria. Asaduddin Sherkoh, a great warrior general was the commander of the Syrian force, which had defeated the Crusaders both in Syria and Egypt. Sherkoh entered Egypt in 1167 to meet the challenge of the Fatamide Minister Shawer who had allied himself with the French. The marches and counter-marches of the gallant Sherkoh and his ultimate victory at Babain over the allied force, according to Michaud, `show military capacity of the highest order''. Ibni Atheer writes about it: `Never has history recorded a more extraordinary event than the rout of the Egyptian force and the French at the littoral by only a thousand cavaliers''.\nOn January 8, 1169 Sherkoh arrived in Cairo and was appointed as the Minister and Commander-in-Chief by the Fatimid Caliph. But Sherokh was not destined to enjoy the fruits of his high office long. He died two months later in 1169. On his death, his nephew Salahuddin Ayubi became the Prime Minister of Egypt. He soon won the hearts of the people by his liberality and justice and on the death of the Egyptian Caliph became the virtual ruler of Egypt.\n\nIn Syria too, the celebrated Nooruddin Mahmud died in 1174 and was succeeded by his eleven year old son, Malik-us-Saleh who became a tool in the hands of his courtiers, specially Gumushtagin. Salahuddin sent a message to Malik-us-Saleh offering his services and devotion. He even continued to keep his name in the `Khutaba'' (Friday Sermons) and coinage. But all these considerations were of no avail for the young ruler and his ambitious courtiers. This state of affairs once more heartened the Crusaders who were kept down by the advice of Gumushtagin retired to Alippo, leaving Damascus exposed to a Frankish attack. The Crusaders instantly laid siege to the Capital city and released it only after being paid heavy ransom. This enraged Salahuddin who hurried to Damascus with a small force and took possession of it.\n\nAfter occupying Damascus, he did not enter the palace of his patron, Nooruddin Mahmud, but stayed in his father''s house. The Muslims, on the other hand, were much dismayed by the activities of Malik-us-Saleh and invited him to rule over the area. But Salahuddin continued to rule on behalf of the young Malik-us-Saleh. On the death of Malik-us-Saleh in 1181-82, the authority of Salahuddin was acknowledged by all the sovereigns of western Asia.\n\nThere was a truce between the Sultan and the Franks in Palestine but, according to the French historian Michaud, `the Mussalmans respected their pledged faith, whilst the Christians gave the signal of a new war''. Contrary to the terms of the truce, the Christian ruler Renaud or Reginald of Chatillon attacked a Muslim caravan passing by his castle, massacred a large number of people and looted their property. The Sultan was now free to act. By a skilful manoeuvre, Salahuddin entrapped the powerful enemy forces near the hill of Hittin in 1187 and routed them with heavy loses. The Sultan did allow the Christians to recover and rapidly followed up his victory of Hittin. In a remarkably short time, he reoccupied a large number of cities which were in possession of the Christians including Nablus, Jericko, Ramlah, Caesarea, Arsuf, Jaffa and Beirut. Ascalon, too, submitted after a short siege and was granted generous terms by the kind-hearted Sultan.\nThe Sultan now turned his attention to Jerusalem which contained more than sixty thousand Crusaders. The Christians, could not withstand the onslaught of the Sultan''s forces and capitulated in 1187. The humanity of the Sultan towards the defeated Christians of Jerusalem procures an unpleasant contrast to the massacre of the Muslims in Jerusalem when conquered by the Christians about ninety years before.\n\nAccording to the French historian Michaud, on the conquest of Jerusalem by the Christians in 1099 `the Saracens were massacred in the streets and in the houses. Jerusalem had no refuge for the vanquished. Some fled from death by precipitating themselves from the ramparts; others crowded for shelter into the palaces, the towers and above all, in the mosques where they could not conceal themselves from the Christians. The Crusaders, masters of the Mosque of Umar, where the Saracens defended themselves for sometime, renewed their deplorable scenes which disgraced the conquest of Titus. The infantry and the cavalry rushed pell-mell among the fugitives. Amid the most horrid tumult, nothing was heard but the groans and cries of death; the victors trod over heaps of corpses in pursuing those who vainly attempted to escape. Raymond d''Agiles who was an eye-witness, says :that under the portico of the mosque, the blood was knee-deep, and reached the horses'' bridles.''\n\nThere was a short lull in the act of slaughter when the Crusaders assembled to offer their thanksgiving prayer for the victory they had achieved. But soon it was renewed with great ferocity. `All the captives'', says Michaud, `whom the lassitude of carnage had at first spared, all those who had been saved in the hope of rich ransom, were butchered in cold blood. The Saracens were forced to throw themselves from the tops of towers and houses; they were burnt alive; they were dragged from their subterranean retreats, they were hauled to the public places, and immolated on piles of the dead. Neither the tears of women nor the cries of little children--- not even the sight of the place where Jesus Christ forgave his executioners, could mollify the victors'' passion... The carnage lasted for a week. The few who escaped were reduced to horrible servitude''.\nAnother Christian historian, Mill adds: `It was resolved that no pity should be shown to the Mussalmans. The subjugated people were, therefore, dragged into the public places, and slain as victims. Women with children at their breast, girls and boys, all were slaughtered. The squares, the streets and even the un-inhabited places of Jerusalem, were strewn with the dead bodies of men and women, and the mangled limbs of children. No heart melted in compassion, or expanded into benevolence''.\n\nThese are the graphic accounts of the massacre of the Muslims in Jerusalem about ninety years before the reoccupation of the Holy city by Sultan Salahuddin in which more than seventy thousand Muslims perished.\nOn the other hand, when the Sultan captured Jerusalem in 1187, he gave free pardon to the Christians living in the city. Only the combatants were asked to leave the city on payment of a nominal ransom. In most of the cases, the Sultan provided the ransom money from his own pocket and even provided them transport. A number of weeping Christian women carrying their children in their arms approached the Sultan and said `You see us on foot, the wives, mothers and dauthers of the warriors who are your prisoners; we are quitting forever this country; they aided us in our lives, in losing them we lose our last hope; if you give them to us, they can alleviate our miseries and we shall not be without support on earth''. The Sultan was highly moved with their appeal and set free their men. Those who left the city were allowed to carry all their bag and baggage. The humane and benevolent behaviour of the Sultan with the defeated Christians of Jerusalem provides a striking contrast to the butchery of the Muslims in this city at the hands of the Crusaders ninety years before. The commanders under the Sultan vied with each other in showing mercy to the defeated Crusaders.\n\nThe Christian refugees of Jerusalem were not given refuge by the cities ruled by the Christians. `Many of the Christians who left Jerusalem'', says Mill, `went to Antioch but Bohemond not only denied them hospitality, but even stripped them. They marched into the Saracenian country, and were well received''. Michaud gives a long account of the Christian inhumanity to the Christian refugees of Jerusalem. Tripoli shut its gates on them and, according to Michaud, `one woman, urged by despair, cast her infant into the sea, cursing the Christians who refused them succour''. But the Sultan was very considerate towards the defeated Christians. Respecting their feelings, he did not enter the city of Jerusalem until the Crusaders had left.\n\nFrom Jerusalem, the Sultan marched upon Tyre, where the ungrateful Crusaders pardoned by Sultan in Jerusalem had organized to meet him. The Sultan captured a number of towns held by the Crusaders on the sea coast, including Laodicea, Jabala, Saihun, Becas, Bozair and Derbersak. The Sultan had set free Guy de Luginan on the promise that he would instantly leave for Europe. But, as soon as this ungrateful Christian Knight got freedom, he broke his pledged word and collecting a large army, laid siege to Ptolemais.\n\nThe fall of Jerusalem into the hands of the Muslims threw Christendom into violent commotion and reinforcements began to pour in from all parts of Europe. The Emperors of Germany and France as well as Richard, the Lion-hearted, king of England, hurried with large armies to seize the Holy Land from the Muslims. They laid siege to Acre which lasted for several months. In several open combats against the Sultan,, the Crusaders were routed with terrible losses.\n\nThe Sultan had now to face the combined might of Europe. Incessant reinforcements continued pouring in for the Crusaders and despite their heavy slaughter in combats against the Sultan, their number continued increasing. The besieged Muslims of Acre, who held on so long against the flower of the European army and who had been crippled with famine at last capitulated on the solemn promise that none would be killed and that they would pay 2,00,000 pieces of gold to the chiefs of the Crusaders. There was some delay in the payment of the ransom when the Lion-hearted king of England butchered the helpless Muslims in cold blood within the sight of their brethren.\n\nThis act of the king of England infuriated the Sultan. He vowed to avenge the blood of the innocent Muslims. Along the 150 miles of coastlines, in eleven Homeric battles, the Sultan inflicted heavy losses on the Christian forces.\n\nAt the last the Lion-hearted king of England sued for peace, which was accepted by the Sultan. He had found facing him a man of indomitable will and boundless energy and had realized the futility of continuing the struggle against such a person. In September 1192, peace was concluded and the Crusaders left the Holy Land with bag and baggage, bound for their homes in Europe.\n\n`Thus ended the third Crusade'', writes Michaud, `in which the combined forces of the west could not gain more than the capture of Acre and the destruction of Ascaion. In it, Germany lost one of its greatest emperors and the flower of its army. More than six lakh Crusaders landed in front of Acre and hardly one lakh returned to their homes. Europe has more reasons to wail on the outcome of this Crusade as in it had participated the best armies of Europe. The flower of Western chivalry which Europe was proud of had fought in these wars''.\n\nThe Sultan devoted the rest of his life to public welfare activities and built hospitals, schools, colleges and mosques all over his dominion.\n\nBut he was not destined to live long to enjoy the fruits of peace. A few months later, he died on March 4, 1193 at Damascus. `The day of his death'' says a Muslim writer, `was for Islam and the Mussalmans, a misfortune such as they never suffered since they were deprived of the first four Caliphs. The palace, the empire, and the world was overwhelmed with grief, the whole city was plunged in sorrow, and followed his bier weeping and crying''.\n\nThus died Sultan Salahuddin, one of the most humane and chivalrous monarchs in the annals of mankind. In him, nature had very harmoniously blended the benevolent and merciful heart of a Muslim with a matchless military genius. The messenger who took the news of his death to Baghdad brought the Sultan''s coat of mail, his horse one dinar and 36 dirhams which was all the property he had left. His contemporaries and other historians are unanimous in acknowledging Salahuddin as a tender-hearted, kind, patient, affable person--- a friend of the learned and the virtuous whom he treated with utmost respect and beneficence. \n\n`In Europe'', says Phillip K. Hitti, `he touched the fancy of the English minstrels as well as the modern novelists and is still considered the paragon of chivalry''.', 0, 1, '61.5.135.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3048, 77563),

If I just relate their names it will take months, years and it is too late. But three masters I will certainly tell you about.\n\nOne was a thief. Once I got lost in the desert, and when I reached a village it was very late, everything was closed. But at last I found one man who was trying to make a hole in t he wall of a house. I asked him where I could stay and he said ''At this time of night it will be difficult, but you can say with me - if you can stay with a thief''.And the man was so beautiful. I stayed for one month! And each night he would say to me, ''Now I am going to my work. You rest, you pray.'' When he came back I would ask ''Could you get anything?'' He would say, ''Not tonight. But tomorrow I will try again, God willing.'' He was never in a state of hopelessness, he was always happy.\n\nWhen I was meditating and meditating for years on end and nothing was happening, many times the moment came when I was so desperate, so hopeless,that I thought to stop all this nonsense. And suddenly I would remember the thief who would say every night, ''God willing, tomorrow it is going to happen.''\n\nAnd my second master was a dog. I was going to the river, thirsty and a dog came. He was also thirsty. He looked into the river, he saw another dog there -- his own image -- and became afraid. He would bard and run away, but his thirst was so much that he would come back. Finally, despite his fear, he just jumped into the water, and the image disappeared. And I knew that a message had come to me from God: one has to jump in spite of all fears.\n\nAnd the third master was a small child. I entered a town and a child was carrying a lit candle. he was going to the mosque to put the candle there.\n\n''Just joking,'' I asked the boy, ''Have you lit the candle yourself?'' He said,\n\n''Yes sir.'' And I asked, ''There was a moment when the candle was unlit, then there was a moment when the candle was lit. Can you show me the source from which the light came?'' And the boy laughed, blew out the candle, and said, ''Now you have seen the light going. Where has it gone? You will tell me!''\n\nMy ego was shattered, my whole knowledge was shattered. And that moment I felt my own stupidity. Since then I dropped all my knowledgeability.\n\n\nIt is true that I had no master. That does not mean that I was not a disciple\n\n-- I accepted the whole existence as my master. My Disciplehood was a greater involvement than yours is. I trusted the clouds, the trees. I trusted existence as such. I had no master because I had millions of masters I learned from every possible source. To be a disciple is a must on the path. What does it mean to be a disciple? It means to be able to learn. to be available to learn to be vulnerable to existence. With a master you start learning to learn.\n\n\nThe master is a swimming pool where you can learn how to swim.

(68852, 1108, 30870, 'Nabeel', 90, '', 1257531829, '[b]Origin of the term "jeep"[/b]\n\n\nThere are many explanations of the origin of the word "jeep," all of which have proven difficult to verify. Probably the most popular notion holds that the vehicle bore the designation "GP" (for "Government Purposes" or "General Purpose"), which was phonetically slurred into the word jeep. However, R. Lee Ermey, on his television series Mail Call, disputes this, saying that the vehicle was designed for specific duties, was never referred to as "General Purpose," and that the name may have been derived from Ford''s nomenclature referring to the vehicle as GP (G for government use, and P to designate its 80-inch (2,000 mm) wheelbase). "GP" does appear in connection with the vehicle in the TM 9-803 manual, which describes the vehicle as a machine, and the vehicle is designated a "GP" in TM 9-2800, Standard Motor Vehicles, September 1, 1949, but whether the average jeep-driving GI would have been familiar with either of these manuals is open to debate.\n\nMany, including Ermey, suggest that soldiers at the time were so impressed with the new vehicles that they informally named it after Eugene the Jeep, a character in the Popeye cartoons that "could go anywhere."[1]\n\nWords of the Fighting Forces by Clinton A. Sanders, a dictionary of military slang, published in 1942, in the library at The Pentagon gives this definition:\n\n    Jeep: A four-wheel drive vehicle of one-half- to one-and-one-half-ton capacity for reconnaissance or other army duty. A term applied to the bantam-cars, and occasionally to other motor vehicles (U.S.A.) in the Air Corps, the Link Trainer; in the armored forces, the ½-ton command vehicle. Also referred to as "any small plane, helicopter, or gadget."\n\nThis definition is supported by the use of the term "jeep carrier" to refer to the Navy''s small escort carriers.\n\nEarly in 1941, Willys-Overland demonstrated the vehicle''s off-road capability by having it drive up the steps of the United States Capitol, driven by Willy''s test driver Irving "Red" Haussman, who had recently heard soldiers at Fort Holabird calling it a "jeep." When asked by syndicated columnist Katherine Hillyer for the Washington Daily News (or by a bystander, according to another account) what it was called, Irving answered, "It''s a jeep."\n\nKatherine Hillyer''s article was published nationally on February 20, 1941, and included a picture of the vehicle with the caption:\n\n    LAWMAKERS TAKE A RIDE- With Senator Meade, of New York, at the wheel, and Representative Thomas, of New Jersey, sitting beside him, one of the Army''s new scout cars, known as "jeeps" or "quads", climbs up the Capitol steps in a demonstration yesterday. Soldiers in the rear seat for gunners were unperturbed.\n\nThis exposure caused all other jeep references to fade, leaving the 4x4 truck with the name.\n\nWillys-Overland Inc. was later awarded the sole privilege of owning the name "Jeep" as registered trademark.\n\nThe term was also in military slang use to mean something untried, or untested.\n\nSource: [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep#Origin_of_the_term_.22jeep.22[/url]', 0, 1, '119.73.6.152', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1535, 77745),

It is not permissible to eat animals and birds that hunt their prey or those animals and birds that eat filthy things. For example, it is haraam to eat lions, wolves, jackals, cats, dogs, monkeys, hawks, falcons, vultures, etc. Those animals that do not fall under this category are halaal. For example, it is halaal to eat parrots, mynahs, doves, sparrows, quails, wild ducks, pigeons, antelopes, buck, ducks, rabbits, etc.\n[/b]\n2. It is not permissible to eat badgers, lizards, tortoises, turtles, wasps, mules, donkeys, etc. It is not permissible to eat the meat of a female ass nor is it permissible to drink her milk. It is permissible to eat the meat of horses, but preferable to abstain from it. Among the sea animals, only fish are permissible. All other animals of the sea are haraam.\n\n3. It is permissible to eat fish and locusts without slaughtering them. Apart from these two animals, it is not permissible to eat any animal that has not been slaughtered in the Islamic way. It is haraam to eat an animal that has died a natural death.\n\n4. It is not be permissible to eat a fish if it dies naturally and begins to float on the surface of the water.\n\n5. It is permissible to eat the tripe of halaal animals. It is not haraam to do so, nor makruh.\nGo Top\n\n6. If a few small ants or worms die in anything, it will not be permissible to eat that thing without first removing those dead ants or worms. If one or two ants or worms go down the throat, one will get the sin of eating a dead animal. Some people eat wild figs together with the little worms that are found inside thinking that by eating these wild figs they will not be afflicted by evil eyes or evil gazes. This is haraam. They will get the sin of eating a dead animal.\n\n7. It is not permissible to purchase and eat meat that is sold by a non-Muslim even if he claims that he had it slaughtered by a Muslim. However, if the Muslim who slaughtered it remains in the presence of the non-Muslim all the time until all the meat is sold, it will be permissible to consume such meat. Alternatively, the person who slaughtered the meat could call another Muslim to keep watch over it until all the meat is sold. At no time should any Muslim absent himself from that meat.\n\n8. A fowl or chicken that eats a lot of filthy things should be encaged for three days and only after that should it be slaughtered and eaten. It is makruh to eat such a fowl without encaging it for three days.', 0, 1, '119.152.62.205', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2919, 77756),

ATF is not just oil, its got alota compounds such as anti oxidents, surfacants, detergents which are very helpful in our use.\n\nas far as lenolin is concerned, its also very hard to find. however since u''r in Lahore, I can direct to a hydro carbon supplier which sent me a sample quiet a while back. its like blubber/fat. first we need to melt it before adding it to the lubricant for increased staying ability. however down side is that lenolin leaves a waxy film which would not oxidize ashless. hence its good if u want to make an oil which serves only as a preservative not as an active lubricant.\n\nnow if u want the oil to have more staying ability, the best and tried and tested way is to add STP oil additive. it''ll make the lubricant thick (more viscosity) so that it wont run off. but then again, all testing showed that it doesnt provide any increased lubrication(infact greatly reduces viscosity index) and infact the results were lower than that of my regular concotion. neccessatating its absence.\n\nthe figures I got from testing various combinations clearly showed that "ITS BETTER TO HAVE BETTER LUBRICATION (OPTIMUM VISCOSITY, HIGHER VISCOSITY INDEX, HIGHER FLASH POINT), HIGHER PENETRATION AND HIGHER COOKING OFF (OXIDIZING) TEMPERATURES THAN HIGHER VISCOSITY (THICKER OIL) THAN NEEDED TO INDUCE BETTER STAYING ABILITY.\n\none thing i''ve learned through all this is that the trick is not to make an oil thicker to get better results but to make it as thin as possible to while maintaining the performance benchmarks. u see, thicker oils slow down mechanical movements. and in actuality, increase friction, heat and wear. now u know why new age high performace lubricants are practically water thin. the objective is to make it as thin as possible while obtaining/maintaining the best results.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '203.99.53.64', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1189, 77888),

Carrying all time without a dire need/ necessity is useless and no one does it if the needs not there.\nThink before you decide that are you going to wear your gun on you always like a habbit or seldom CCW.\nAs per a normal self aware person, SD is mostly menifested in seldom carry, HD all time and Range Practice the most favorite and also required thingy. So make sure of yourself.\nIf you want Taurus, as everyone has suggested dont go for 24/7... set aside the basic required virtue of a firearm whic is reliability, it is not really good to look at even. Why dont you check Taurus 917 and 809??\nIf you want to do CCW as a basic requirement, go for Stoeger...

Does it not come down to nomenclature as per given to ammo by inventor/manufacturer. Even if there is 1 or 2 occurance of such(.308) type, the whole dealing with Per Inch calculation of caliber loses the scientific logic and comes down to nomenclature. Here 2+2 is not always DEAD 4.\nI personally think it goes on and on, i.e when we move from Small arms to Big arms.

What''s the Difference?\n\ncopyright 2001 - Stephen Redgwell \n\n[u][b]Military surplus cases[/b][/u]\n \nDo you have a military surplus rifle chambered in 7.62 x 51mm? If so, you probably bought it to get a "308 Winchester" at a really low price. Well, you messed up. It''s like looking at a rabbit and a hare. They''re close, but each is distinctive, and you have to understand what you''re looking at. \n\nEarly in my military career, I worked on the FNC1 rifle (7.62 NATO). For someone that had only handled civilian shotguns and rifles, this was going to be a real treat! It was only natural that curiosity would generate questions and comparisons about what I thought was the same cartridge - 308 Winchester and the 7.62x51mm NATO.\n\nOne of my personal rifles was a Midland 2100 chambered for 308 Winchester. It was made in England by a small company - Midland Rifle Co - but owned by Parker Hale. Since there was a lot of military 7.62x51mm available, I shot them from my 2100 from time to time. There was never a problem chambering or firing the military stuff. It was a pleasant diversion over the long (read boring) periods spent at the range for base small arms qualifications. \n\nAround this time, I discovered that shooting reloaded cases fired from an FN was virtually impossible. They didn''t want to chamber. My frustration led me to ask an older armourer what was wrong. In a nutshell, he told me that they probably didn''t fit because they stretched. I was using a Lee Loader in 308 Winchester and didn''t know that they only resized the neck, leaving the rest of the case untouched. The shoulders were blown forward on initial firing, so the case was simply too long to fit my rifle''s chamber! Hmmm... \n\nI tried the gauges from work in my own rifle and was surprised to discover that none of them would fit! The corporal brought a set in from home and explained the difference.

(69125, 2343, 0, 'Abbas', 1, '', 1257636660, 'Salams All,\n\nRecently I bought a CZ 999, most of you will be familiar with it by now as it has one of the highest spots on our recommended list. Here is a short review followed by pictures, also since many members interested in the CZ999 are new to the world of firearms they would like it compared to competitors in it''s price range and beyond. It retails between 43 k to 50 K depending on city and bargaining skills. \n\nThis is a medium frame pistol made by Zastava of Serbia which was formerly known as Crvena Zastava hence the CZ designation. The pistol comes in a simple white cardboard box with a second magazine and a barrel brush. It''s 9mm with a magazine capacity of 15 shots. \n\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/999C_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\nFirst impressions of the pistol are that it feels slightly heavy but solidly built, the workmanship seems good, much better than expected. Although the manufacturers claim it is an original design, it is very much a replica of the SIG 226 which is one of the best pistols of the world. There are three external controls on it, a slide release which also acts as a decocker, a dis assembly latch and the magazine release button. The interesting thing is that the pistol is completely ambidextrous i.e the magazine release switch and slide release/decocker are on both sides of the pistol which is great for left handed shooters.\n\nThe pistol fit snugly in my hand, the slide is fitted tightly on the frame and the action is very smooth. The trigger is at 4.5 pounds on double action and about 2.5 on single.\n\nOn the technical side the slide is machined from a solid piece of steel which makes it much more stronger and durable. The barrel like most good modern pistols is cold forged and chrome plated, I was surprised to learn that with proper maintainence the barrel life expectancy is 200,000 rounds ! No one is going to get anywhere near that number but it''s phenomenal and says a lot about the manufacturers confidence in their product. \n\nThere are a few nags about the pistol as well, for one the front sight of my pistol is bent a little to the left, I will probably have to get it replaced. The other concern that I have is that I don''t really like the look of the dis assembly lug from inside, it seems a little thin for the heavy slide. These are minor irritants which can be easily fixed but the only major issue I have with the 999 is the lack of a safety. There is a firing pin block but that is no replacement for an external safety. \n\nI tested fired some rounds in Islamabad and in Lahore a few weeks back but not enough to form a solid opinion. Till I fire about 200 rounds from my own piece in the same environment as every other pistol I test I won''t comment much. My expectations are quite high though. Will post a range report when the range reopens InshAllah.\n\nHere is the usual eye candy. Normally I don''t compare with more than two pistols but since CZ999 is getting to be a pretty popular pistol and people ask many questions about size etc I have also added some other pistols for comparison in later pictures. Enjoy !\n\n \n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZ999a.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZ999B.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZ999C.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]\nI''m going to go out on a limb and compare it''s build quality with a Glock 17 ;)[/b]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZ999F.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZ999D.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZ999G.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZ999H.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[b]Size Comparison with large, medium and compact frame pistols.\n[/b]\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/999B_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/999D_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/999A_resize.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '119.154.55.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3091, 78043),

Also, below CZ 999 belongs to one of my dearest friend, we got it for 48K from Gujranwala City Baig Sons GT road.

I guess that solves it. but i''ve heard few complaints from users that they are disturbed to see the rib angling down to left/right when using such a gun. well... the remedy is to ignore the rib or if u cannot ignore then get ur self a fiberoptic bead sight. the snap on type that attaches itself using magnets. and very easy to take off as well. most of the users confirmed that this remedy helped alot. "HIVIZ Fiberoptic bead sight M300", tried and tested, the exact size for baikal mp153 rib.\n\nabout magazine extension... they are available but the ones that i''ve seen only added like one extra round to the magazine capacity. the juice is not worth the sqeeze.\n\nabout choke tubes....they are not available in the local market but can be ordered through internet.

How she wanted that necklace and when she asked her mother if she would buy it for her, her mother said, "Well, it is a pretty necklace, but it costs an awful lot of money. I''ll tell you what. I''ll buy you the necklace, and when we get home we can make up a list of chores that you can do to pay for the necklace. And don''t forget that for your birthday Grandma just might give you a whole dollar bill, too. Okay?" \n\nJenny agreed, and her mother bought the pearl necklace for her. Jenny worked on her chores very hard every day, and sure enough, her Grandma gave her a brand new dollar bill for her birthday. Soon Jenny had paid off the pearls.\n\nHow Jenny loved those pearls. She wore them everywhere to kindergarten, bed, and when she went out with her mother to run errands. The only time she didn''t wear them was in the shower - her mother had told her that they would turn her neck green. Now Jenny had a very loving daddy. When Jenny went to bed, he would get up from his favorite chair every night and read Jenny her favorite story. One night when he finished the story, he said, "Jenny, do you love me?"\n\n"Oh yes, Daddy, you know I love you," the little girl said.\n\n"Well, then, give me your pearls."\n\n"Oh! Daddy, not my pearls!" Jenny said. "But you can have Rosie, my favorite doll. Remember her? You gave her to me last year for my birthday. And you can have her tea party outfit, too. Okay?"\n\n"Oh no, darling, that''s okay." Her father brushed her cheek with a kiss. "Good night, little one."\n \nA week later, her father once again asked Jenny after her story, "Do you love me?"\n\n"Oh yes, Daddy, you know I love you."\n\n"Well, then, give me your pearls."\n\n"Oh, Daddy, not my pearls! But you can have Ribbons, my toy horse. Do you remember her? She''s my favorite. Her hair is so soft, and you can play with it and braid it and everything. You can have Ribbons if you want her, Daddy," the little girl said to her father.\n\n"No, that''s okay," her father said and brushed her cheek again with a kiss. "God bless you, little one. Sweet dreams."\n\nSeveral days later, when Jenny''s father came in to read her a story, Jenny was sitting on her bed and her lip was trembling. "Here, Daddy," she said, and held out her hand. She opened it and her beloved pearl necklace was inside. She let it slip into her father''s hand. With one hand her father held the plastic pearls and with the other he pulled out of his pocket a blue velvet box.\n\nInside of the box were real, genuine, beautiful pearls.\n\nHe had them all along. He was waiting for Jenny to give up the cheap stuff so he could give her the real thing. So it is with our Heavenly Father. He is waiting for us to give up the cheap things in our lives so that he can give us beautiful treasure.

Gen. Cone told Associated Press. As a member of the base Special Reaction Team, Munley had learned that "if you act aggressively to take out a shooter, you will have less fatalities," Cone said.\n\nSoon after Munley fired at Hasan, taking him down, she herself fell wounded and police radios quickly sent out an "Officer down" call.

But this power is in no comparison with bigger diesels when it comes to taking heavy loads to steep climbs and getting out of ditches specially when there is no way of gaining momentum. There is not much to do @ the power front other than installing a snorkel / free flow intake. Getting a turbo EFI will be expensive but will spin the ride like nothing else.\n\nSPACE\nA small trailer is an ideal solution for all logistic issues. Care must be taken when getting one made. It should have AT LEAST the same size of tires as the towing vehicle if not wider. This provides floating rather than dragging of the trailer therefore less power is required for towing. As off-roaders know already, its good to have tire pressure decreased in sand for the vehicle as well as the trailer. \n\nThere is a catch with the trailer, i.e., it is useful when the hunting party is camping or stationed at one location. Sometimes hunting route requires a one way trip, so all the belongings are supposed to be carried along all the time. Having a trailer hitched all the time decreased overall speed, increased fuel consumption, and in most cases makes it impossible to sprint the vehicle following a target OR running away from the five different departments looking after the game reserves ;)\n\nAlternate to the trailer is to have a sturdy roll-cage (if its a soft top) of atleast 2 -2.5" dia pipe. Affix a light weight custom made aluminium carrier to the rear of the vehicle just above the spare wheel. Never on the top as it will change the center of gravity of an already  high vehicle. Although the cargo space will be much lower than the trailer, it will still be sufficient and provide clutter free seating.\n\nCOMFORT\nAlthough it will not make the ride car like but will be nothing short of amazing to have wider than standard soft-walled (round walled) tires and long travel oil filled shock absorbers rather than gas shocks. Although handling is better with gas shocks, comfort is much better with oil shocks.\n\nAll the stuff is either available in the market at nominal prices or can be fabricated by any good fabricator.

How ever hard cast bullets are a different ball game.  \n \nJHP is a bullet which is copper jacketed and designed to expand after impacting and penetrating muscle and bone on animals. These do not cause leading in the bore and can be driven at higher velocities. \n\nHydra Shock is a bullet made by Federal   Ammo makers it is a well researched and tried round for  over 20 yrs, it has a lead post inside the hollow point which assists in ensuring the bullet expands even when fired through thick jackets and clothing. Heavy clothing plugs up the hollow point and the bullets fail to expand; this was noticed in several police shootings in the US. \nThe post inside the hollow point increases the forces acting on the bullet to expand when it enters tissue and fluids. The dynamics of this can be asked from Federal.\n\nFor 15 k I would spend most of it on the genuine POF ammo for practice and would buy the hydra shox for carrying for HD and SD. These rds are well tested and found reliable in the 92 FS. How ever I would shoot about 50 of these very expansive rds to make sure these function reliably in my gun and magazines. Also you can consider combining 3 to 2 ball in your magazine; a car wind screen and doors are  best penetrated by the POF variety on angling shots. I mean 3 hydra shox and two POF and you can make any combo you like.

The Armscor bullet has a larger mouth and the jacket does not go over the edge like it does with the Magtechs, which could be the reason they hang up in some guns.  But conversely the large lead mouth probably aids expansion.\n\nI think that it is a better idea to get these cheaper JHPs (less than Rs. 100 per bullet) and run a box or two through your weapon and become familiar with their ballistics.

The guy was a psychologist, serving U.S army with the rank of Major, had ancestral roots in Jordan, and was about to be dispatched to Iraq or Afghanistan, being noted as one possible mental distress that caused him to commit this horrific act of brute violence. My condolences with those bereft and indeed, it is such tragic and stupid acts which contribute to the rise of Hate feelings around the world.

Strange, he wasn''t stopped by other soldiers within the hall, coz most likely they may have been armed too, at least with a handgun. If he was the only armed guy, how did he manage in? What I mean to say is, it takes quite a "while" to kill 12 people, wound 31 with a pair of HANDGUNS only! This should have given time enough to pacify him long before. The guy managed to fire AT LEAST 43 SHOTS, that too, if he made no MISSES at all, and most probably he did, and may have changed  a couple of mags before he was finally undone with.

It''s big.[/quote] Well, if so, with 70% traditional dress wear, the IWB , in my opinion, is not a "practical" solution. In winters, best "practical" solution would be the "horizontal" shoulder holster, beneath a jacket. For summer the OWB would be a "compromise", with a "bit" quicker drawing possibility than with the IWB, provided, if you use any hip side pockets in the "Kurta", it''s SEWN ON THE LEFT SIDE of your shirt, if you"re a right handed shooter! You see, we mostly carry our guns just for the sake of "carrying" them and normally think we would get sufficient time to draw the thing, yet in actual life where you''d really have to draw your gun, it''s mostly a matter of few seconds only, wherefore I think a covered "horizontal" shoulder holster with grip of gun pointing "outward" your body would be the quickest in my opinion. The "vertical" shoulder holster would be fine, too, provided you don''t have a ''heavy" chest and short "arm-stretch", coz this would really make it hard for you to reach for your gun! Trust me, try it for yourself! The OWB was a best solution in "Zia" days, when "open carry" was of no issue.

THE ONLY REASON BEHIND THIS POST IS TO SHARE THIS IDEA WITH YOU GUYS AND GET YOUR POSITIVE FEEDBACK SO IT BECOME BENIFICIAL FOR OTHER MEMBERS AS WELL".[/b]\n\n\n[b]Background / Purpose:[/b]\nThere are many of us including myself who just can’t afford any Gun Club for practice shooting. I was thinking to have something that can be use for indoor/rooftop shooting practice therefore I came up with this idea of converting lethal 12gauge cartridge into non lethal or less lethal that can be used in-house to do some target practice shooting as well as can be use to teach/train our other house members.\n\nSecondary purpose of this conversation is to make a loud bang noise to scare someone suspicious moving around outside your home. This will not only make a noise but will actually hit because it has a Less/Non Lethal projectile that can hit the target, especially if scaring is the only purpose then shot this at your main gate (as mostly main gates are iron made) it will not penetrate or damage your gate but will add up the noise as it hits the iron gate, I am sure this will not only scare the suspicious guy but your neighbors too and they will also be alarmed as they heard this loud bang at the gate.\n\n[b]NOTE: [/b]This was my first ever try to bring my idea into real life. It was just an initial experiment so please will not conclude any result from my this post as a matter of fact there are still many thing to try therefore it will be improved gradually indeed, there will always be a margin of improvement. \n\nOne more thing that I would like to clear first, this initial experiment was limited to only 7 shots that is all what I have got from someone. Therefore I tried to cover different variation within 7 available shots. The only reason of my limitation is, I am still waiting for my license therefore I don’t have any firearm/ammo yet, even the shotgun I use in this experiment was belong to that same guy to whom I have borrowed these shells.\n\nHere I am starting with this photo below:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVqEMRS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qEMRS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAs you can see these all are [b]Shaheen # 4[/b] (Birdshot) I open/trim their faces in different ways and tried different methods for sealing them and used “UHU Glue” on some of them, you can easily notice their differences in my other posted photos below. After opening their faces I takeout/pour out all their pellets, didn’t takeout the wed leave it inside as it is and then filled them with my experimental materials. For sealing I have done 3 different things as you can see [b]number 1[/b] has its own star crimp, [b]number 2, 3 and 4[/b] is sealed with hard transparent sheet and [b]number 5[/b] is sealed with paperboard.\n\n\n[b]Materials used as projectile:[/b]\n\n[b]NUMBER 4: [/b]\nYou can clearly notice “Safaad Chanay”  [b]MEMEMBER:[/b] This was not my main focus material in this experiment and neither It was for fun. The reason of doing this it to check how much compression they can make when very light weighted projectile is used  \n\n[b]Results:[/b] As expected had a little bang, as compression was not good enough to make a Big Bang therefore had no recoil at all and wide spread of “chane” on the wall at 20 feet distance. But Trimming and Sealing method was successful. \n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] This “Chane” can be replaced with any other similar things (for example different pulses) but should be sealed more tightly and with some other strong material/sheet so it can be used to make Loud Bangs.\n\n\n\n[b]NUMBER 2, 3 AND 5: [/b]\nThese 3 shots has same projectile “PLASTIC CLAY” which was my focus experimental material but have tried 3 different sealing methods for testing their reaction.\n\n[b]Number 2 and 5: [/b] After taking out all pellets I simply filled (pushdown) plastic clay directly on the wed (in number 2 and 5) then sealed them differently as shown in photo. \n\n[b]Number 3: [/b]Here I applied a different method for its projectile (plastic clay). I cut the wool glove’s pinky finger and filled with some plastic clay and tied up its open end with thread then pushdown “Clay Bag” heads up on the wed and sealed it. Simply theory behind this clay bag is when fired this clay bag will detached from wed and will hit the target alone. But this will not be happen in number 2 and 5 case, as plastic clay would stick with wed and will travel together. \n\n[b]Results:[/b] Performed very well more then my expectation and had a loud bang but with less recoil which was a good thing. The target was a thin small size pillow at [b]25 – 30 feet[/b] distance. All 3 shots hit the target.\n\n[b]Number 2 and 5:[/b] Aimed center of the pillow but one hits on the right side and other hit on the top corner. Both shots penetrated and went through from backside stick on the wall and scratched some paint. Reason: plastic clay and wed was stick together therefore it was unstable and jointly managed to gain some penetration power. \n\n[b]Number 3:[/b] It worked very well as per its theory and hit very close to the center and didn’t penetrate the pillow. \n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] This initial test proven its results that with some modification/improvement is Plastic Clay is one of the best options which is easily available and can be use for practice shooting. \n\n\n[b]NUMBER 1:[/b]\nAs you can see it just looks like regular/shock cartridge but has some hidden modification because it didn’t cut its star crimp and opened it very carefully with small screwdriver pour out all this pellets, took the same wool grave and cut the other finger and filled it with 1/3 of its own pellets tied up the open end with thread and pushdown this Pellet Bag heads up and with hard thumb pushes closed its star crimp.\n\n[b]Results: [/b]As expected its was very powerful, loud bang and had same recoil like shock birdshot. Hit very close to its target, penetrate the pillow hit the wall behind, all pellets spread out on impact because when bag hit the cemented well it lacerate the wool bag. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]Its works perfect as it looks, and same like other it also needs some improvement i.e Bag should be made of some strong cloth for example “jeans”. Bag loads can be replaced with many other different things. If using its own pellets when should load half of the weight to reduce its impact etc. Their own Star Crimps are the best for sealing purpose, as mentioned I have tried different methods but I found this star crimp is the best thing to make a good compression inside the shell. \n\n\n\n[b]In Future: Second Phase of this Experiment:[/b]\n\n[list=*]\n[/list] My next Focus material would be [b]WAX[/b] and will try with different variations\n\n[list=*]\n[/list] I will also try to use [b]Bouncy Rubber Ball[/b] known as [b]Magic Ball[/b] as projectile\n\n[list=*]\n[/list] I am also searching for any suitable [b]Rubber Material in Raw Form[/b] that can be melt easily and then mold /reformed into perfect sized [b]Rubber Slugs[/b]\n\n\n(I am Adding few words here which i forget to mentioned yesterday)\n\n[list=*]\n[/list] I will continue my experiments on [b]PLASTIC CLAY[/b] and [b]BEAN BAGS[/b] to improve their performance\n\n\n[b]PRECAUTIONS:[/b]\n\n[b]DO NOT try to overload any projectile[/b]\n\n[b]DO NOT overload shell''s compression by sealing it very hard or tight[/b]\n\n\nBelow are some more photos along with the ShotGun which i used in this experiment.  \n\n\n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVqInQS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qInQS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVqIxPr][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qIxPr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVqIHO0][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qIHO0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts1igwyS][img]http://s2.postimage.org/1igwyS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqHHmIS][img]http://s3.postimage.org/HHmIS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVqJ0L9][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qJ0L9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqHHO9r][img]http://s3.postimage.org/HHO9r.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts1iiiOi][img]http://s2.postimage.org/1iiiOi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts1iiFfA][img]http://s2.postimage.org/1iiFfA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVqJpHA][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qJpHA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVqJCai][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qJCai.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVqJJEJ][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qJJEJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts1ijkF0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/1ijkF0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nI have tried to explain everything, hope you guys will like my efforts.\n\nregards,', 0, 1, '58.65.160.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3128, 78896),

In my opinion (and solely my own opinion) arms are nothing to be collected. Rather they are an essential part of the society. And being a Muslim, I would refer you to a Hadith (I am not sure about references, maybe someone else could make references about this Hadith, I think it is in Sahi Bukhari, not sure :() The text of Hadith says:\n[b]Weapons are the ornaments of Mo''min (Believer/Muslim)[/b]...\nAnd another occasion when Holy Prophet Said:\n[b]Verily, you must know that knowing (learning) archery is power, knowing archery is power, knowing archery is power.[/b]\nAnd modern day archery = shooting.\nWhatever, I am well justified in saying that arms are not a hobby for us Muslims but an obligation, a proud emblem of our warrior ancestors. However we must ensure that like them, our ancestors, we use our arms only to bring about peace in the world.\nIn a nutshell a Muslim deserves, rather is entitled to arms...\n\nKeeping the talk aside, I do not have a collection, but I have a Norinco 9mm and my younger brother has recently gifted me a CZ-75 (Metal Blue finish, Walnut grips, modified hind and front sights). I do not shoot them very much but I am good at shooting, trained by the Air Force :). However I carry at least one when I am on a journey or not in a weapon-restricted area.\n\nMy interests include handguns at the top :).

Get yourself a revolver then.\n\nHowever, my recommendation would be CF98, Stoeger, CZ999, Baikal Viking or PT92/99 (all PG favorites and recommended) depending on your budget and which one fits your hand well.

Enough said! it’s a lot easier to acquire a weapon than properly storing it in a ready-to-use state while insuring adequate rust protection. Anybody who owns a cabinet queen that just sits there and collects dust, serving no purpose other than the occassional wow! cool! oooo! aaaaaa! gaaagaaa! of friends, knows what I’m yapping about here.\n\nNow this cookie though seems tough is a lot easier to crack especially when one defines his/her goals (storage horizons) properly. Before we begin, let’s get certain things straight. We are assuming that we want to store the firearm in a ready-to-use state. Therefore no such solution will be pondered upon that renders it useless. No grease, no Cosmoline, no Vaseline or similar stuff that requires/mandates prior cleaning/removal before use. Let’s define the possible goals shall we? \n\n1. Upto 1 month\n2. Upto 3 months\n3. Upto 6 months\n4. Upto 1 year\n5. Upto 5 years\n\nBefore we begin looking at possible solutions to meet each goal, allow me to stress the need to make sure that the weapon is safe. Kindly make sure that it is empty. Once ensured, kindly continue treating the weapon in the same manner as one would treat a loaded weapon. Safety first! All else later!\n\n[b]Upto 1 month:[/b]\n\nAlmost any kind of in expensive machine (or sewing machine) oil will do. Even WD40 is good enough for the job. A good light film/coating of almost any type of mineral oil will get the job done here. The preferred storing condition would be open storage (not enclosed) where there is plenty of ventilation so the moisture doesn’t condensate on any metal surface of the firearm. One can enclose the weapon but it only increases the chances of trapping any moisture with the firearm in the container and the steps required to remove/contain the moisture are simply put “THE JUICE IS NOT WORTH THE SQUEEZE”\n\n[b]Upto 3 months[/b]\n\nAny good quality gun specific oil will get the job done. Oils such as Remington, hoppes and Pakguns Lubricant will provide adequate rust protection here and will not gum up over time. Just a good cleaning job on the firearms followed by a light coating of any specialty gun oil will ensure a rust free storage. Again storage should be the open type for the same reasons described above.\n\n[b]Upto 6 months[/b]\n\nThis is where it gets a little bit tricky. We want to store a firearm for upto six months and it needs to be rust free as well as in a state of readiness. One solution would be to get VCI impregnated oil and lightly coat all metal surfaces of the firearm. Volatile Corrosion Inhibitor is the space age technology of the corrosion prevention. VCI leaves a mono-ionic layer on the metal surface that acts as an active barrier against oxygen and moisture. There are specialty oils out there that are impregnated with VCI technology. They provide protection in two ways, first through the use of oil as basic contact preservative and second by depositing VCI molecules over the metal surface. Here again I would recommend open type storage conditions and not enclosed.\n\n[b]Upto 1 year[/b]\n\nFrom here on out, I do not recommend open type storage. The best and most appropriate procedure would be to clean the weapon thoroughly, apply a coating of VCI impregnated oil and get the firearm sealed inside a low density polyethylene bag with minimum film thickness of 200 microns. The high thickness film is needed to ensure low moisture transmission through the plastic barrier. Any ordinary pulse sealer is good enough for the job of sealing. The VCI technology employed by the specialty gun oil is more than enough to combat the moisture that gets trapped within the plastic bag. Throw in a few silica gel packs (actually more than what you need cause they are dirt cheap) in there incase you are still concerned. Try not to leave any finger prints on the weapon. Better yet, use latex gloves while handling the weapon.\n\n[b]Upto 5 years[/b]\n\nNow we are really stretching the whole concept of a properly stored, ready to use weapon here. Therefore it necessitates some extra care. Clean meticulously and then apply a coating of VCI oil. Afterwards vacuum seal the weapon in a LDPE bag (minimum film thickness 200 microns). Throw in a lot of silica gel packs. Some caution, DO NOT LEAVE ANY FINGERPRINTS ON THE FIREARM. One trick to vacuum seal the weapon is to use ordinary home vacuum cleaner. Seal the bag but leave a small opening for the vacuum cleaner hose. Insert the hose and suck all the air out then completely seal the bag. Care must be employed to avoid any air getting back inside the bag.\n\n[b]Some notes:[/b]\n\nThere are other VCI products out there such as VCI paper and tablets but nothing comes close to the protection offered by VCI impregnated oils. Remington makes VCI oil and so does the ‘Inhibitor’. The later is better known and commands the highest respect in corrosion protection for firearms. Both are available online for purchase.\n\n[url]http://www.gamaliel.com/cart/product.php?productid=6156&cat=1414&page=1[/url]\n[url]http://www.remington.com/products/accessories/gun_care/VCI_technology.asp[/url]\n\nI could have recommended the use of golden rods that heat up the air surrounding the firearms to prevent rusting but they require electricity and I wanted the solutions to be input free or more appropriately said, WATTS FREE.\n\nSilica gel packs are reusable and can be recharged by heating them in a microwave for 2 minutes at high heat, let them sit for a while to cool off then repeat two more times. This will recharge the silica gel for use again.\n\nSilica gel packs are pretty cheap and are available at scientific supplies’ stores for less than 3 rupees a pack (5g each). Some companies in Karachi quote them at 500 rupees a Kg.\n\nFor people living in high corrosion areas must cut the duration period by half. For example, 5 years is equal to 2.5 years and 1 year equal to six months for those who live in aggressive corrosion prone areas.\n\nPolymers are ok with extended oil contact oil however, wood will soften during prolonged contact so it is advised to first stand the firearm upside down for some time after applying a coat of oil so that all the oils runs down the muzzle instead of the stock. \n\nAmmo can also be stored/sealed in LDPE bags for extended duration. Just remember to put in few silica packs.\n\nYou might want to search online for VCI gun oils. Plenty of good brands are out there. The most respected however is the “Inhibitor V80”.\n\nthere are other solution out there such as VCI polyethylene bags. these plastic bags emitt VCI and are widely used in the firearms industry for corrosion protection.

Those who have rural lands that are not being used for agriculture can use that land to breed birds, deer, and other such animals.  Hunters should try to be hunters and not meat collectors and avoid over hunting a particular area.  DO NOT HUNT with out the correct permit, restrictions on hunting certain animals are not their just for the fun of it they are there to protect the species.  DO NOT HUNT in the off season.  basically sir if we can all just use common sense and not go over board it will make a significant distance.  for example i have been on shoots in the UK where even semi auto shotguns are limited to only two rounds if you miss the bird in your two shots the correct protocol is to literally take your hat off and salute the bird for it''s victory.  \n\nWith regards to Private Ranches i feel that it''s the owners of these ranches prerogative who they allow or don''t allow to hunt on their property, indeed hunting is used by many as a social and political networking tool, i see nothing wrong with this as long as nature and the wildlife are respected and conserved.', 0, 1, '58.181.102.52', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3135, 79334),

I just can''t afford this kind of help (not talking about money)\n\nBESIDE this... if your factory already have some scrape rubber pieces laying here and there and you are thinking to use them (melting, molding and shaping) to make these rubber balls/pellet then just for the experiment it will be acceptable.\n\nNow come to the ball''s diameter and you are talking about BBs or SG sized pallets.  As per my thinking small size rubber pallets will be too light in weight to stay on target, specially if taking about some distance  for example 25-30 feet. so my thinking is the bigger the heavier then it will stay on target. But for experiments rubber buckshot with the size of (0.36") can be a batter option. For target practice shooting i think  1, 2 or 3 big pellet will be perfect.    here i am posting some photos from internet just for references and better understanding along with some technical details. \n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqOolir][img]http://s3.postimage.org/Oolir.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]This ammo is a direct fire 12 gauge which fires 3 each, 46 grain, 55 diameter rubber projectiles.

In his fresh application, Cheema sought permission to hunt migratory birds, especially waterfowl until the middle of March. He said waterfowls did not have a permanent abode in Pakistan and return to their homeland on the commencement of summer. \n\nHe said hunting of these birds was a ‘fun and food’ sport and there was no justification in banning the hunting of these birds. The petitioner said earlier the LHC, on a petition by late MD Tahir, had declared the blanket prohibition for hunting as unlawful.\n\nIn reply to the application, the Wildlife officials said the government action was necessary to protect wildlife, which was on the verge of extinction. If remedial measures were not taken, it would result in annihilation of wildlife, which would also have devastating effects on environment, the officials said.\n\nThey said the Punjab government had banned hunting under the Punjab Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Amendment Act, 2007, which permitted limited hunting from October 15, 2008 to February 15, 2009 on Sundays.\n\nAbout the judgement cited by the petitioner, the judge observed that analysis of the judgment reflected that hunting as a sport was abhorred as the Islamic injunctions allowed hunting only for the survival of mankind.\n\nThus even on the benchmark and touchstone of this judgment, while blanket prohibition has not been approved, parameters for hunting have been laid down, the judge remarked.\n\n“No embargo has been placed on the government to regulate the hunting season or adopt appropriate remedial measures to ward off extinction of animals and birds. Therefore, the respondent officials had acted within their domain and jurisdiction by regulating the hunting season and the order was meant to strike an environmental balance and save wildlife from extinction. This was not violation of the precedent referred to.” With these observations the judge dismissed the application.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to my opinion; the application was technically at weak bases by Mr.Saeed Nasim Cheema. We will try again with fresh and logically technical grounds. Let sone more try. But event han salute to Mr.Cheema & toMr. MD Tahir.\n\nThere are no fresh surveys done by wildlife department in this regard in previous years. At the other hand all birds markets are full with illegally captured wildlife species. \n\nHunter with shooting lisence can’t shoot 11 Partridges or 10 ducks per hunting day. \nBut any body can purchase 100.partridges and 20 ducks any time from the poachers including many other rare species. \n\nThink about it; who is involve in this business and under which shelter this business is rising day by day?\nAtleast hunters are not reason for the decline of game birds but poachers are. \n\nDepartment doing nothing; to develop the wetlands, also there is no proper patrolling at sanctuaries, reserves during off days of hunting season. \n\nAfter November 21, 2009, Hunting Masters soon appearing in court with fresh grounds; with prays of all well wishers. \n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '117.102.16.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3146, 79478),

Though it sounds unlikely, the migratory patterns of the Houbara Bustard have an amazing amount of influence in Pakistan.\n\nThis story starts of with the Arabs, who are as superstitious as men come in this day and age. Amongst other suppositions, they believe that the Houbara is a walking, talking supercharged Viagra pill, and hence try to eat as many birds as they can, with a few really desperate ones eating up to 500 birds a year!\n\nNow, the Arabs hunted out the Houbara in their lands back in the sixties, and moved on to wherever else it can be found. \n\nThe Houbara is an endangered species, and the rest of the world kicked the Arabs out after some time - leaving only Pakistan for the Arabs to hunt in. \n\nSelf respecting nations like India kicked the Arabs not so much for the sake of the birds, but because of the way the Arabs hunted - treating the locals like dirt and acting like medieval kings wherever they went.\n\nSo it came to that the only place left for the Arabs to go was Pakistan.\nThey started pouring in the money - building palaces, warehouses and even airfields around the country, and buying local officials wherever they went.\n\nSome Arab royal family members lease huge tracts of land in Pakistan and come yearly to hunt them. This is not a new problem - In 1912, the British banned the hunting of Houbara on the subcontinent. \n\nBut since the 1960s, when the bustard was hunted to near extinction in the Middle East, Arab sheikhs have carved up Punjab, Sindh and Baluchistan into unofficial hunting fiefdoms.\n\n Hunting of the houbara bustards was officially banned in 1972, but successive Pakistani governments have bowed to the sheikhs’ wishes, allowing them to indulge their belief that bustard meat has aphrodisiac qualities.\n\nThey employ sophisticated electronic means, along with the older tried and tested ways of bribing the conservation and wildlife agencies to keep track of the movement of other hunters, and of course, to keep track of every Houbara in their areas.\n\nA hunting permit for the Arabs is not just a license to go hunt a few birds - on the lands they hunt the Arabs are the masters of all they see, and they go through these areas like marauding lords of ages long gone by, with no regards whatsoever for the locals, whose fields they destroy if they happen to be in the way\n\nIncidents are brushed up by the federal govt, and the Arabs sprinkle money liberally wherever they go to keep the locals happy. Everyone, from the government on down to the tribal lords on whose lands they hunt on to the thousands of shikaris they employ to keep track of the Houbara, is paid according to their status.\n\nThe Arabs build (almost) no schools and fund no hospitals. Each hunting party spends tens of millions of dollars, yet none really trickles down to the locals. \n\nThe bulk of the money is spent on paying off various Pakistani tribal lords and government officials, and the rest is spent on them selves. \n\nThere is nothing funded by the Arabs on the lands they hunt and spend so much time one - their favorite hunting grounds are the most backwards areas in this country, and remain so despite years of Arab hunting parties. \n\nThe government, along with other misguided fools, keeps saying that these hunts help out the areas where the hunts take place, but reality is far removed. \n\nThe money the Arabs pays to the locals ends up keeping those areas far poorer than the ones which the Arabs leave alone.\n\n Take Jhal Magsi for example, one of the Arabs hunting grounds - where the literacy rate is an astounding 4 pecent - the lowest in Pakistan.\n\n[list=*]\n[/list]What is a soon to be extinct bird between two fellow Muslim countries after all?\n[list=*]\n[/list] Or a few rapes and abductions every hunting season? It’s not like they draw cartoons, after all.\n\n[list=*]\n[/list]What happens when the Houbara dies out?\n[list=*]\n[/list]What will all the hundreds of sardars and so many more dependent on easy Arab money do? \n[list=*]\n[/list]What about the villages whose men are in the employee of the Arabs, and know no other means of income?\n\nPakistan has a very tight relationship with Arab governments - and the Houbara had the large role in establishing that bond. It led to the heads of Arab states coming on long hunting trips here, which in turn led to them establishing friendships with politicians and the landed gentry. \n\nWhy else would the heads of state pay so much attention to Pakistan? \nFellow Muslim countries be damned - Saudi Arabia doesn’t give any other country billions of dollars of oil for free.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]\n\nRef: KO.OFFROAD', 0, 1, '117.102.16.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3148, 79513),

[/quote]\nThis is a very old article and even we have its reference in another thread followed by some discussion.\n\nAs for the conception (rather misconception) above, Arabs hunt Houbara bustard primarily as main diet for their hunting birds (falcons etc). And, it definitely satisfies their hunting expedition instincts but that is secondary.[/quote]\n\nDear Tareen,\n\nYou are right its old article but according to latest situations with wildlife policies in Punjab it’s extremely relevant. Personally I have been accommodated a Royal Sheikh’s group for Houbara few years ago. \n\nI was the first man; I struggled to accommodate to them in legal frame. But story is very sad, I was failed to full fill the requirments from both sides (Arabs & Officials) There were matters regarding legal permission, possession licenses for prey birds & for custom clearance etc. \n\nSheiks said, don’t bather about wildlife department & customs to talk about desired hunting and assistance for areas, ‘‘you let us know if you face any problem while arrangements; your ministers are our servants’’\n\nMy dear remember; they are doing all for their adventure; not for conservation and also releasing birds in natural habitat. AND THEY ARE VIOLATING PUNJAB WILDLIFE ACT, regarding Houbara.\n\nEven Punjab Wildlife Department is not authority to stop of to give permission for Houbara hunting. Than its mean the part of the land occupied by Arabs for their hunt is not Part of the Punjab; even the area is not Private Ranches also.\n\nMay you remember a magazine QUDRAT from Karachi; in early 90’s. Qudrat published articles about the wildlife violation by Arabs.\nAnd result; publication stopped by next month, all concerning authorities know well but all are helpless.\n\nSir may you know that; Punjab Wildlife Department is just dummy in all this game of violation.\n\nQuestion is; there is now law for Arabs even hunting banned game birds, under official’s shelter. But achievements & duties of wildlife officials are; to arrest locals & crime is, just crossing to the control lines of Arabs or roaming near their areas.\n\n\nRegards;\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', 0, 1, '117.102.16.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3148, 79573),

Really can''t see how SA is gonna ''classify'' me, coz this is by no way any profession as such, though it still remains my major ''occupation''.\n\nGot no professional credentials as such, only once served an MNC long ago, that too for some fun. Was born in Pakistan, yet spent entire life abroad, about 25 years in different countries of Central Europe, got an equivalent in A'' Levels from abroad, apart from that no academic degrees as such.\n\nYet course for livelihood one does some efforts, and I take care of my properties, land and buildings. The nearest title I could come to as a professional is that of a ''builders''. I like to build new houses, keep some, sell some, rent out some. Like to develop and "landscape" my lands, getting something better out of them for agro use. Architectural perfection is my weakness, I constantly strive for perfection in my house plans and have driven many an architects mad when they can''t come up with anything positive. Basically I lead a relaxed life, don''t like ''urbanization'' that much, prefer the simpler style of life of the past. Thinking now to build another house, farm-style, away from these cities, dense population (no shooting), with more freedom around me, a bit of gardening, a bit of animal sounds, a bit of hunting, a bit of fishing, is where I seek to reside my last. Really wouldn''t like to breath my last in all this urban roar! In this wonderful PG community of ours, with mashallah so many high profiled occupations and academic credentials, I, at times, really do feel like a stranger. Yet, your love, mutual respect, craze and crave for guns, and the highly respecting brotherhood "feel", all combined, keep me glued up on PG! @ SA bro, you got a challenge before you: Classify me, if you can![/quote]\n\nFaisal bhai,\n\nYou are a living manifestation of the vision I have and striving to achieve. The life you have is one which I am striving for currently. After going through your post above, in you, I see a reflection of who I am and who I want to be. Whether its exploring different parts of the world (especially our own nation''s), interior designing and planning, love for rural (farm-style) way of living and dislike of urbanized style of living, farming/agriculture, natural beauty, greenery and the desire to break out of urban life and live in the peace that the country-side has to offer.\n\nEvery now and then I tell my wife and my parents that by 40 (8.5 yrs from now) I plan to have two abodes - one in the city and one in some rural area where I can recede to and relax on weekends and holidays. [u]My father once asked me, tumnay CA is liyay kya tha kay shehar say nikal kar dihaat chalay jao aur kheti bari karo ? and my reply was that CA is liyay kya tha takay main apnay saray shauk aur apna vision achieve kar sakon.[/u] And on hearing this he smiled and wished me the best in life. I tell my wife, kay (bashart-e-zindagi) plan yeh hay kay 40 tak khoob mehnat, 45 pay soft retirement and then onwards just manage what ever I have built by then. Her input is just that purchase that land near Lahore :lol: (My inlaws are based there). Academically speaking, a portfolio manager. Portfolio including agricultural land, commercial property, etc. Which is how I would classify you, if asked to do so? A Portfolio Manager. However, please note that it was never my intention to classify anyone as anything. I love learning and my few months here at PG and the interaction I''ve had here with my PG brethren has taught me alot about not only guns and safety, but more importantly about pursuing your vision, your passion and fulfilling your dreams. \n\nAlso, we are two brothers with my brother being 14 years younger than me (a late model) and he''s doing his pre-engineering at the moment. I''m even encouraging him to go for some agricultural related masters or course after or along-side MBA, ACCA, CA or whatever he wishes to pursue. I personally believe, that just as the past was of agriculture, the coming future will also be of agriculture. And should he choose this field, I''ll back him all the way. \n\nI''ve always had a clear vision of where I want to see myself. Although the vision keeps on updating as I grow up, but even at the age of 13, I had firmly decided that I wanted to do CA along with other things and timelines. Having a vision in place helped me passing matric by 15, inter by 17, CA articles completion by 22, starting my own CA firm (in partnership) by 23, getting married by 25 and a good position in an excellent organization by 31. None of this would have been possible without the blessing of Allah SwT and the prayers of my elders, who supported me throughout.\n\nAfter reading your post, aap say milnay ki tamanna aur barh gai hay, which, I hope, will be fulfilled sometime mid of next month.', 0, 1, '61.5.135.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 332, 80030),

So limp wristing was never a issue. Considering the fact that Glock has polymer frame, and the slide is metal the force is not evenly distributed to the frame rather to the slide, if your grip is loose, it will certainly have a higher recoil and the force will be all to the slide, and all along to your hand, thus the slide won''t comeback fully.\n\nAs for Beretta''s they have been in the market for a long long time and certainly know the tiny tips that make them a successful handgun maker. But they are manufactured for both communities civi and LE. For example the US Army employs the M9 as their primary sidearm, because its actually easy to use and has many external features and safeties, thus minimizing mishaps and can be adopted to the users own style.\n\nWhile the US Rangers and SOCOM SF Operators, use 1911''s and Glocks, these both handguns have no external features, except a slide release and a built in safety. Why, because when they point a gun, they point it with the intent to shoot, and the lesser the external properties, the lesser time to draw pick and shoot. For Glock, simple, single action, draw point and shoot. While the 92 has be double action drawn, draw, safety, point shoot. Most of the Sf and LE guys have a universal training system, thus their firearms are made with their training specifically in mind. Simply Glock is a firearm based on a certain community, while the 92 is just amazing, because it can be adopted to both communities.\n\nI''ve had the opportunity to fire both, i would certainly prefer a 92 over a Glock any day just because i felt the safeties and handling is much better than a Glock, and also due to the fact i have a tiny wrist :D :P', 0, 1, '202.147.163.9', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3161, 80255),

(71394, 2412, 0, 'aq4530ba', 1295, '', 1258436343, 'Go Kiss The World - Inspirational Speech by Subroto Bagchi\n\nPlease read to the end. It''s worth the time spend. Also make your kids read it too.\n\nI delivered this speech to the Class of 2006 at the IIM, Bangalore on defining success. This was the first time I shared the guiding principles of my life with young professionals.\n\nI was the last child of a small-time government servant, in a family of five brothers. My earliest memory of my father is as that of a District Employment Officer in Koraput, Orissa. It was, and remains as back of beyond as you can imagine. There was no electricity; no primary school nearby and water did not flow out of a tap. As a result, I did not go to school until the age of eight; I was home-schooled. My father used to get transferred every year. The family belongings fit into the back of a jeep - so the family moved from place to place and without any trouble, my Mother would set up an establishment and get us going. Raised by a widow who had come as a refugee from the then East Bengal, she was a matriculate when she married my Father.\n\nMy parents set the foundation of my life and the value system, which makes me what I am today and largely, defines what success means to me today.\n\nAs District Employment Officer, my father was given a jeep by the government. There was no garage in the Office, so the jeep was parked in our house. My father refused to use it to commute to the office. He told us that the jeep is an expensive resource given by the government- he reiterated to us that it was not ”his jeep” but the government’s jeep. Insisting that he would use it only to tour the interiors, he would walk to his office on normal days. He also made sure that we never sat in the government jeep - we could sit in it only when it was stationary.\n\nThat was our early childhood lesson in governance - a lesson that corporate managers learn the hard way, some never do.\n\nThe driver of the jeep was treated with respect due to any other member of my Father’s office. As small children, we were taught not to call him by his name. We had to use the suffix ‘ dada ’ whenever we were to refer to him in public or private. When I grew up to own a car and a driver by the name of Raju was appointed - I repeated the lesson to my two small daughters. They have, as a result, grown up to call Raju, ‘ Raju Uncle’ - very different from many of their friends who refer to their family driver, as ‘my driver’. When I hear that term from a school- or college-going person, I cringe.\n\nTo me, the lesson was significant - you treat small people with more respect than how you treat big people. It is more important to respect your subordinates than your superiors.\n\nOur day used to start with the family huddling around my Mother’s chulha - an earthen fire place she would build at each place of posting where she would cook for the family. There was neither gas, nor electrical stoves.The morning routine started with tea. As the brew was served, Father would ask us to read aloud the editorial page of The Statesman’s ‘ muffosil ’ edition - delivered one day late. We did not understand much of what we were reading. But the ritual was meant for us to know that the world was larger than Koraput district and the English I speak today, despite having studied in an Oriya medium school, has to do with that routine. After reading the newspaper aloud, we were told to fold it neatly. Father taught us a simple lesson.He used to say, “You should leave your newspaper and your toilet, the way you expect to find it”. That lesson was about showing consideration to others. Business begins and ends with that simple precept.\n\nBeing small children, we were always enamored with advertisements in the newspaper for transistor radios - we did not have one. We saw other people having radios in their homes and each time there was an advertisement of Philips, Murphy or Bush radios, we would ask Father when we could get one. Each time, my Father would reply that we did not need one because he already had five radios - alluding to his five sons.\n\nWe also did not have a house of our own and would occasionally ask Father as to when, like others, we would live in our own house. He would give a similar reply,” We do not need a house of our own. I already own five houses”. His replies did not gladden our hearts in that instant.Nonetheless, we learnt that it is important not to measure personal success and sense of well being through material possessions.\n\nGovernment houses seldom came with fences. Mother and I collected twigs and built a small fence. After lunch, my Mother would never sleep. She would take her kitchen utensils and with those she and I would dig the rocky, white ant infested surrounding. We planted flowering bushes. The white ants destroyed them. My mother brought ash from her chulha and mixed it in the earth and we planted the seedlings all over again. This time, they bloomed. At that time, my father’s transfer order came. A few neighbors told my mother why she was taking so much pain to beautify a government house, why she was planting seeds that would only benefit the next occupant. My mother replied that it did not matter to her that she would not see the flowers in full bloom. She said, “I have to create a bloom in a desert and whenever I am given a new place, I must leave it more beautiful than what I had inherited”.\n\nThat was my first lesson in success. It is not about what you create for yourself, it is what you leave behind that defines success.\n\nMy mother began developing a cataract in her eyes when I was very small. At that time, the eldest among my brothers got a teaching job at the University in Bhubaneswar and had to prepare for the civil services examination. So, it was decided that my Mother would move to cook for him and, as her appendage, I had to move too. For the first time in my life I saw electricity in homes and water coming out of a tap. It was around 1965 and the country was going to war with Pakistan. My mother was having problems reading and in any case, being Bengali, she did not know the Oriya script. So, in addition to my daily chores, my job was to read her the local newspaper - end to end. That created in me a sense of connectedness with a larger world. I began taking interest in many different things. While reading out news about the war, I felt that I was fighting the war myself. She and I discussed the daily news and built a bond with the larger universe. In it, we became part of a larger reality. Till date, I measure my success in terms of that sense of larger connectedness. Meanwhile, the war raged and India was fighting on both fronts. LalBahadurShastri, the then Prime Minster, coined the term “ JaiJawan, JaiKishan ” and galvanized the nation in to patriotic fervor. Other than reading out the newspaper to my mother, I had no clue about how I could be part of the action. So, after reading her the newspaper, every day I would land up near the University’s water tank, which served the community. I would spend hours under it, imagining that there could be spies who would come to poison the water and I had to watch for them. I would daydream about catching one and how the next day, I would be featured in the newspaper. Unfortunately for me, the spies at war ignored the sleepy town of Bhubaneswar and I never got a chance to catch one in action. Yet, that act unlocked my imagination.\n\nImagination is everything. If we can imagine a future, we can create it, if we can create that future, others will live in it. That is the essence of success.\n\nOver the next few years, my mother’s eyesight dimmed but in me she created a larger vision, a vision with which I continue to see the world and, I sense, through my eyes, she was seeing too. As the next few years unfolded, her vision deteriorated and she was operated for cataract. I remember, when she returned after her operation and she saw my face clearly for the first time, she was astonished. She said, “Oh my God, I did not know you were so fair”. I remain mighty pleased with that adulation even till date. Within weeks of getting her sight back, she developed a corneal ulcer and, overnight, became blind in both eyes. That was 1969. She died in 2002. In all those 32 years of living with blindness, she never complained about her fate even once. Curious to know what she saw with blind eyes, I asked her once if she sees darkness. She replied, “No, I do not see darkness. I only see light even with my eyes closed”. Until she was eighty years of age, she did her morning yoga everyday, swept her own room and washed her own clothes.\n\nTo me, success is about the sense of independence; it is about not seeing the world but seeing the light.\n\nOver the many intervening years, I grew up, studied, joined the industry and began to carve my life’s own journey. I began my life as a clerk in a government office, went on to become a Management Trainee with the DCM group and eventually found my life’s calling with the IT industry when fourth generation computers came to India in 1981. Life took me places - I worked with outstanding people, challenging assignments and traveled all over the world.\n\nIn 1992, while I was posted in the US, I learnt that my father, living a retired life with my eldest brother, had suffered a third degree burn injury and was admitted in the Safderjung Hospital in Delhi. I flew back to attend to him - he remained for a few days in critical stage, bandaged from neck to toe. The Safderjung Hospital is a cockroach infested, dirty, inhuman place. The overworked, under-resourced sisters in the burn ward are both victims and perpetrators of dehumanized life at its worst. One morning, while attending to my Father, I realized that the blood bottle was empty and fearing that air would go into his vein, I asked the attending nurse to change it. She bluntly told me to do it myself. In that horrible theater of death, I was in pain and frustration and anger. Finally when she relented and came, my Father opened his eyes and murmured to her, “Why have you not gone home yet?” Here was a man on his deathbed but more concerned about the overworked nurse than his own state. I was stunned at his stoic self.\n\nThere I learnt that there is no limit to how concerned you can be for another human being and what the limit of inclusion is you can create.\n\nMy father died the next day. He was a man whose success was defined by his principles, his frugality, his universalism and his sense of inclusion.\n\nAbove all, he taught me that success is your ability to rise above your discomfort, whatever may be your current state. You can, if you want, raise your consciousness above your immediate surroundings. Success is not about building material comforts - the transistor that he never could buy or the house that he never owned. His success was about the legacy he left, the memetic continuity of his ideals that grew beyond the smallness of a ill-paid, unrecognized government servant’s world.\n\nMy father was a fervent believer in the British Raj. He sincerely doubted the capability of the post-independence Indian political parties to govern the country. To him, the lowering of the Union Jack was a sad event. My Mother was the exact opposite. When Subhash Bose quit the Indian National Congress and came to Dacca, my mother, then a schoolgirl, garlanded him. She learnt to spin khadi and joined an underground movement that trained her in using daggers and swords. Consequently, our household saw diversity in the political outlook of the two. On major issues concerning the world, the Old Man and the Old Lady had differing opinions.\n\nIn them, we learnt the power of disagreements, of dialogue and the essence of living with diversity in thinking.\n\nSuccess is not about the ability to create a definitive dogmatic end state; it is about the unfolding of thought processes, of dialogue and continuum.\n\nTwo years back, at the age of eighty-two, Mother had a paralytic stroke and was lying in a government hospital in Bhubaneswar. I flew down from the US where I was serving my second stint, to see her. I spent two weeks with her in the hospital as she remained in a paralytic state. She was neither getting better nor moving on. Eventually I had to return to work. While leaving her behind, I kissed her face. In that paralytic state and a garbled voice, she said,“Why are you kissing me, go kiss the world.” Her river was nearing its journey, at the confluence of life and death, this woman who came to India as a refugee, raised by a widowed Mother, no more educated than high school, married to an anonymous government servant whose last salary was Rupees Three Hundred, robbed of her eyesight by fate and crowned by adversity was telling me to go and kiss the world!\n\nSuccess to me is about Vision. It is the ability to rise above the immediacy of pain. It is about imagination. It is about sensitivity to small people. It is about building inclusion. It is about connectedness to a larger world existence. It is about personal tenacity. It is about giving back more to life than you take out of it. It is about creating extra-ordinary success with ordinary lives.\n\nThank you very much; I wish you good luck and God’s speed. Go! kiss the world. :D', 0, 1, '116.71.48.211', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3172, 80444),

But for our prototype we can try smaller sizes than this for both single and multiple shots.  \n\nYesssssssss   you are right here too ....  if using single rubber ball then we do need some soft filler material. In this regard i was thinking to use shock wed but will cut off half of its length (fins) then will place few soft rubber pads (I have a soft rubber sheet  that can be use for this purpose, (will post photos soon for batter understanding)  I assume this will not be that difficult for me..... \n\nEven i have an other option  which is (cloth bag)  i will put this single rubber ball (even two balls) in it  and this bag will have its cloth tail which is used as a stabilizer (may be couple of tail) but this tail will also work as a filler on the wed. (See below photo for reference and better understanding)  Due to this cloth bag shot''s re bounce will also reduce significantly but then ball''s diameter should be 16.5mm rather then 16.7mm (if using with this bag idea)\n\n  \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s1.postimage.org/1iybp9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nI hope you will agreed with this ....\n\nBut for prototype,  I would like to try what Irfan Bhai is making for this purpose.

He stated that since vehicles served a convenient medium to transport arms and explosives, installation of “x-ray inspection system” had become necessary to safeguard cities. For this, he said, the government had signed an agreement with China for provision of X-ray inspection system through a concessional loan with the maturity period of 25 years.\n\nAccordingly, a China-based company will provide its “non-intrusive vehicles X-ray inspection system (NVIS)”, with state-of-the-art technology. This system can quickly scan moving vehicles with full loaded cargo to help law enforcement authorities detect contraband and explosive-laden cargos in the normal flow of traffic. With these capabilities, NVIS also enables law enforcement authorities to scan high volumes of vehicles without impeding traffic flow and at the same time providing integrated data from many sources for use in a wide range of security and productivity applications.\n\nDawn Staff Reporter adds: The spokesman has failed to respond to most of the key concerns raised in the Dawn story about the effect of radiation on the passengers of such vehicles, particularly if such huge X-ray scanners were installed at the entry points of major cities like Islamabad. It’s also not clear who were the ‘experts’ who had cleared the scanners and whether similar scanners from other countries were also tested or considered?\n\nThe police bureau clarification has also failed to provide specifics of the intensity of radiations that the Chinese scanners may emit, or details of any other countries where such scanners were installed other than on their borders.\n\n[url]http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/national/decision-to-install-scanning-system-taken-at-highest-level-019[/url]', 0, 1, '61.5.135.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3178, 80560),

This is the standard version of the gun: the .9x19mm-Parabellum is replacing the three standard calibers (.7''62x25mm-Tokarev, .7''62x17mm "Palestinian Type", and, in a much minor way, the .9x18mm - Makarov High Impulse) which are commonly used in Chinese service. This pistol will fire any standard civilian grade or military ordnance 9mm ammo, plus it is a robust pistol capable to fire the new Chinese DAP-92 .9x19mm cartridge. The DAP-92 is an armor piercing cartridge borrowed from the PBP 9mm-Parabellum bullet cache developed in Russia for the KPB GSh-18 pistol. In fact, the armor-piercing capabilities of the DAP-92 cartridge doesn''t only come from the material that composes the bullet (a steel-made penetrator core which tip protrudes from a brass jacket), but mainly  from the fact that the cartridge has a so hot load that it developes extra pressures when fired (comparable to +P+ or even +P++ in "Western" standards). Such pressures do require an extra solid gun to handle them without major damages, and the QSZ-92 sure is. A commercial variant of the QSZ-92/9mm has been already developed for export and civilian markets, its distribution was expected for 2003 but after the Bush administration''s 2 years-long ban of any NORINCO products from American imports and markets, the launch of this gun will be postponed after the expire of this ban.\n\n\n    source:   [url]http://www.securityarms.com/20010315/galleryfiles/2700/2796.htm[/url]', 0, 1, '119.153.13.90', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3131, 80662),

(71787, 2424, 0, 'aq4530ba', 1295, '', 1258538293, 'Salam,\n\nGuys i thought id take this opportunity to stress how important it is that you remain safe on the road. As the numbers of cars are increasing everyday on our roads, we are having an increasing number of accidents of which the vast majority are either fatal or are capable to damage you for life.\n\nIt is our responsibility as citizens of Pakistan to educate people on how to keep yourself and your families safe on the road; which is why I post this thread here today.\n\n1) [u]Seat Belts[/u] are a MUST!!! If your in your youth and want to show of to your friends then this is not the way to do it. Cars are not toys. They involve a great risk to you and others when put into use; even while following the rules of the book. (My father says, "driving is normally an evil necessity") Treat cars with due respect. A common misconception that we have amongst us that if you have an ''airbag'' in the car you do not require the seat belt. "SRS (Supplementary Restraining System)  AirBags" are supplementary to seatbelts, not the other way round! Car manufacturers are not stupid. They have done years of research and put seat-belts in because they are needed to keep you safe.\n\n2) [u]Speeding[/u] Generally, People love to speed everywhere. Residential roads are not made for speeding. People pop in and out from everywhere and by speeding you are asking for trouble! Observe speed limit signs (even though we dont have many in karachi) But rule of thumb: In the city, Keep below 80kmph. Braking distance is directly proportional to the instantaneous speed squared (speed x speed)! so increasing speed a little increases your braking distance by a lot. At the end of the day, if you go at an average speed and if you rush through everything what do you save? 2 minutes? MAX? Not worth it... Look at your opportunity cost. Drive slow and get to your destination safely 2 minutes late, or speed and run the chance of not getting there at all.\n\n3) [u]Turning[/u] Not much that i can say about this. Just go slow and watch out for other cars. Also, learn about right of way. People whom have a speed bump in their way when turning onto the main road must wait for their turn. The people whom do not have a speed bump have the ''right of way''. :P\n\n4) [u]Tires[/u] It is essential that you replace your tires every so often. Pakistani tires normally have a life of 3 years, where as Japanese or Korean tires have a life of 4 years. What i mean by life is that no matter how much you run the tires, the rubber after the life is over will become much harder than normal, which could make the tires more prone to puncturing when at high speeds or when hitting something such as a rock in the road. As you can imagine, if a tire punctured while you are at speed, it would not be a pretty outcome. Also remember to keep tire pressures correct. All the tires should be filled when they are cold and they should all have the same pressure. LTV''s (light transport vehicles) such as pick up trucks are an exception in which the back tires have a higher pressure than the front ones to permit loading stuff on the back. The recommended pressure is usually written on the panel of the driver side door. In the winter pressures will fall, and in the summer they will rise. Remember to keep a check on them.\nLastly, when the tread of the tires are worn out, have them replaced, it is a worthwhile investment! In emergency breaking and traction in water/sand or mud the extra tread on your tires may well be the difference between life and death.\n\n5) [u]Regular servicing[/u] Cars are expensive assets for a majority of people. It is one of the biggest investments they make. Hence, it is only logical that you would want to take care of it. Have the oil and oil filter changed every 5000 kilometers OR every SIX months. whichever comes first. Cars that do not run much and have a lot of cold starts tend to have a higher level of sulfur mixed in the oil. This sulfur mixes with condensation inside your engine to make sulphuric acid and will decrease your engine life quite significantly (Thus the six months recommended time limit). For CNG cars or cars that are used in rough terrain, oil changes should be more regular, say every 4000 kilometers.\n\nAnd Lastly, 6) [u]Road Rage[/u] Refrain from it!!! It will normally end up in getting you in trouble. Chill out and relax. Some people on the road may tick you off; but it is your duty as a responsible individual to be mature and forget it. Picking fights over petty little issues is not worth it. We are civilized people remember? :P\n\nThat said, we must all dua that Allah keep us and our families safe on and off the road. After all, he is the decider of our fate. \n\nIf you feel that i have missed something please do add on.\n\nDrive safe fellow Pak-Gunners! :)', 0, 1, '119.155.21.178', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3191, 80860),

The discussion mainly revolved around hollow points and reliability issues associated with them. which can be anything from feeding to reliable/stated expansion.\n\nafter the discussion, I thought why not check the feed ramp of my CF98 cause some users have complained that hollow points do not feed reliably in them. when I looked at the barrel I noticed that a feed ramp is there but upon closer look I noticed that the feed ramp is not integrated and it not part the barrel. the feed ramp is sorta like built into the connection seat (description as per manual, otherwise called rotating lock). I could clearly see that this type of setup would definately cause some sort of resistance to HP rounds as they are not fully rounded from the tip. any edged bullet would definately get some sort of resistance as the bullet has to ride up the feed ramp and hop over the empty space then into the seperate barrel. if the feed ramp would be integrated it would definately be a one smooth (fluid) motion. but then again, in a rotating lock mechanism u just cant have an integrated feed ramp. so I took the gun apart and placed a HP bullet (courtesy of Dr. Zakir) on the feed ramp (mimicking a round feed) and slowly started pushing it towards the barrel. guess what? I clearly felt resistance as the sharp angle of the HP round would get sorta stuck in the space between the feed ramp and barrel.\n\nwent to a friend of mine who also own a CF98 and same thing happened in his gun as well. I guess that settles the argument that only my CF98 is incompatible with HP rounds.\n\nnow, after all this I thought of stoeger and upon seeing its pictures on internet I believe that a stoeger would also be incompatible with HP rounds as it also has a very similar design and feed ramp is also not integrated into the barrel. its feed ramp is also built into the rotating lock. the images clearly showed same space between the feed ramp and the barrel. I''m assuming that since everything from the design point looks the same I guess it would also pose similar reliability issues with HP. however stoeger owners/users can confirm on that.\n\nnow comming to the main point. what can we do to solve this issue. i''m thinking highly polishing the feed ramp to improve feeding. i''ll get back with results as soon as I get that donw. but i''m also thinking that there is nothing I can do with the two piece feed ramp and barrel design. so i''m kinda out of ideas there.

The event should take place this month, said Steve Myers, CERN''s Director for Accelerators and Technology.\n\nThe collider made headlines last week when a bird apparently dropped a "bit of baguette" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down. The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz. Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said.\n\nAs it begins to run at full energy, greater than any machine of its kind, the LHC will help scientists explore important questions about the universe. The ambitious project also has attracted its share of doubters.\n\nSome alarmists expressed fear last year that the accelerator could produce a black hole that might swallow the universe -- a theory that LHC physicists, including Myers, dismiss as science fiction.\n\nAnother fringe theory holds that the LHC will never function properly because it is under "influence from the future," according to physicists Holger Bech Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya. They suggest in recent papers that no supercolliders that could produce the Higgs boson, an as-yet-unseen particle that would help answer fundamental questions about matter in the universe, will work because something in the future stops them.\n\nThis also explains the "negative miracle" of Congress canceling the Superconducting Supercollider project in Texas in 1993, Nielsen wrote in a paper on arXiv.org, a site where math and science scholars post academic papers.\n\n"One could even almost say that we have a model for God," one who "hates the Higgs particles," Nielsen wrote.\n\nBut bizarre ideas about the LHC -- and in particular the debunked black hole theory -- have gotten more people interested in the whole project, said Joseph Incandela, professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He will be in the position of deputy spokesperson for the CMS experiment, one of the two general-purpose experiments at the LHC, as of January.\n\nAlthough physicists such as Incandela have been working on the same questions and building accelerator experiments for decades, no one has paid much attention before now, he said. There were people who followed the topic, but not the broad audience that emerged in the past year or two, he said.\n\n"Maybe it''s just captured people''s imaginations," he said. "It''s really a wonder of science and technology to build such a large accelerator, a 27km-long machine that works at the precision of a fraction of the diameter of your hair," he said.\nWhen push comes to shove, the name of the game is ''what is nature,'' and we''re not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us,"\n--Mark Wise, professor of physics at Caltech\n\nThe results of the LHC experiments may help resolve fundamental problems such as the disconnect between Albert Einstein''s theory of relativity, which describes the world on a large scale, and quantum mechanics, the laws of matter on a scale too small to see.\n\nThe LHC, located underground on the border of Switzerland and France, passed a proton beam halfway around the circular tunnel Saturday, undeterred by the bird incident earlier in the week.\n\nThe full-circle beam event scheduled to happen this month also took place last year on September 10 amid much celebration.\n\nBut just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose, and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said. The faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two-thirds of an inch by two-thirds of an inch.\n\n"There was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident," he said. Now, "people are feeling a lot better because we know we''ve done so much work in the last year."\n\nEven physicists who are not on the ground at CERN, awaiting for news from the LHC abroad, haven''t given up.\n\nMark Wise, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, said he''s just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year, and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event.\n\nWise noted that Tevatron, the collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, has also had its share of failures, but is generally considered to work just fine.\n\n"It''s a horribly complicated piece of equipment, it''s not like there''s not going to be problems along the way," he said. "They will surmount those problems."\n\nLHC personnel have done a lot of testing of electrical connections to make sure the incident is not repeated under the same conditions, and it developed a new magnet protection system, Myers said. They have also put 900 pressure relief valves all around the machine so that if a similar problem does occur, the same kind of pressure build-up will not take place.\n\nMyers hopes to have particle beam collisions before Christmas, and then prepare the machine for higher-energy particle-smashing.\n\nThe full scientific program for the LHC will probably last more than 20 years, he said.\n\nBut it won''t be that long before scientists could potentially discover new properties of nature. The Higgs boson, also called "the God particle" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said. Evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a "super partner" with similar properties in a quantum dimension (some physicists believe there are extra dimensions the world) -- could crop up as early as 2010.\n\nFor some theoretical physicists such as Wise, finding the Higgs boson and verifying every prediction of the Standard Model of physics would be the worst outcome. He wants the LHC to deliver surprises, even if that means no Higgs.\n\n"When push comes to shove, the name of the game is ''what is nature,'' and we''re not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us," Wise said.\n\nATLAS and CMS are the general-purpose experiments designed to find the Higgs boson and other rare particles that have never been detected before.\n\nALICE, another experiment, will explore the matter that existed some 10 microseconds after the Big Bang, said John Harris, professor of physics at Yale University and national coordinator of ALICE-USA.\n\nAt that time, there was a "hot soup" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, he said. Although they have never been directly seen, these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons, neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it.\n\nThe "soup" is actually liquid that flows extremely fast, but will only be around for about 10-21 microseconds before it cools down and is itself miniscule, he said.\n\nNot everyone who works on LHC physics intended on becoming a scientist. Incandela thought he was going to be an artist, and studied chemistry because he was interested in glass sculpture. It happened that he was also good at math and physics and ended up going into that.\n\nDespite obvious differences, art and science -- even LHC-related physics -- do have some commonalities, Incandela said.\n\n"Both of them enrich the human existence beyond just the maintaining of health, wealth and welfare," he said. "They both have an idealism also associated with them, a timelessness."\n\nBy Elizabeth Landau,\nCNN', 0, 1, '110.37.13.131', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3197, 81004),

If using light loads, lighter then its original weight  then sound will be lower then normal so do the less recoil.\n2.

The cartridge supplied by POF contains 26 gms gun powder for skeet and trap cartridges. The commercial load contains 31 gms. The difference i found is that skeet or trap load has plastic cap instead of wad . And in my experience cylinder choke give most consistent patterns with skeet and trap load ( POF cartridges ). Plus there is strict quality check for skeet and trap loads resulting in good quality. The commercial brand has plastic wad. What i found is that it fails to open resulting in very tight patterns. Once in hunting trip i blew a hole in a duck which is almost at 20 yrds and i was using 8 no shot. I found out that wad does not open properly. From than onwards i took special care and found out at many instances wad failed to open. \nHaving said that when using a good pointer or in case of flushing birds especially after rain or early morning  9 no shot is excellent choice  with cylinder choke.[/quote]\n\nur right about the gramage of skeet and trap loads. they are lighter cause they are not hunting loads and do not need that much power. plus this way recoil is also less which is good for one''s shoulder.\n\nas far as plastic cap is concerned, i''m confused here cause I use POF cartridge (trap/skeet) on quiet regular basis and they both have star shaped crimp instead of a flat cisc (plastic cap). I believe this is most efficient for good patterns.\n\nas far as i''m concerned, I basically prefer (most might not agree) No. 4 shot for everything. oooo yea! Rambo style baby. but use various chokes combinations depending upon scenario. for quail and patridge (with a dog ofcourse) I use improved cylinder+modified. if its a semi auto I strictly use improved cylinder only.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '203.99.53.57', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1162, 81131),

Service weapons which are the property of Army, are issued to officers for official tasks only and are deposited back in unit kotes after completion of duty. Though these are issued in the name of an officer but he can use them when on duty only and can not carry them during private commitments. Walther P38 falls under this category. \n\n2.  Every serving officer, as per the law of the country, is allowed to carry two pistols / revolvers without license. These are purchased by officers at their own expense and could be of any make and type (excluding PBs). These handguns are the private property of an officer and after retirement, the officer has to get a license if he still wants to keep them. Making use of this facility is optional and not a compulsion. Some of the phased out Walther P38s or Webley revolvers etc are being sold to serving officers of the rank of Colonel and above on very cheap rates. \n\nWalther P38 may therefore fall under both the above categories, ie, as an official sidearm which is still in use as well as a private weapon when it has been phased out and has been sold to an officer. \n\nI reckon the TT carried by your nephew in SWA is most likely not an official sidearm (cat 1) but a private one which he is authorised to keep and use (cat 2). \nregards', 0, 1, '210.2.170.238', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3089, 81248),

I thought Bro. Basharat will complete this, might hv been overlooked by him. Basharat has already quoted, in bro. KMB’s thread, “do you shoot a thief” Sec. 103 of Pakistan Penal Code titled “When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death”, (corresponding to TPC 9.42 by StevenCline)  it is dangerous to imply right to use lethal force from bare reading of Sec.103 PPC, or else, with out having clear idea bout nature, intention, scope of relevant statutes, meaning of the terms used in statutes, interpretation and application of law by apex courts, etc.,etc.\nAnd further keeping in view the assertions like,   “…..and SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK and when they fall to the ground SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD AGAIN”, “Right of private defence, did not provide a licence for an unlimited description to go on causing excessive harm even to a robber”hence Section 103, 104 and 105 of PPC., for your consideration:\n\n[b]“THE PAKISTAN PENAL CODE, 1860  ACT NO.

Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property;\nFourthly.

Also another interesting perspective is variation in provincial laws as to what is pb or npb. As mentioned that only sindh Govt. allows for greater calibers in rifles and that also in bolt action only. Does this mean that there is more requirement for rifles in sindh than in punjab? :rolleyes:   or  maybe simply Punjab Govt is more strict whereas Sindh Govt has a softer corner for such arms.

PT 917C for the looks, rails for accessories.

If you don''t have this "urge" as such, Cougar would do you good friendship, and if you''re totally divided between them both, perhaps the "feel" in hands of both guns, would turn out to be the final and "determining" factor overall. Try them out both at the dealers. Let''s hear some more comments, however. Good luck, anyway, and enjoy your stay over here.

The excessive twist can cause accelerated barrel wear, and in high velocity bullets an excessive twist can cause bullets to literally tear themselves apart under the centrifugal force.\n\n[u][b] Choosing the right rifle.[/b][/u]\n\n When choosing a rifle cartridge you should always evaluate what you are going to use the rifle for and then select the rifle with the correct rifling twist rate for your imparticular use by bullet weight to gain the most accuracy.\n\n[u][b]Pitching[/b][/u]. Suppose that a bullet is travelling in a straight line. If due to some reason (I don''t want to discuss the reasons else it becomes a physics class) its nose goes up or down it is called pitching.

Its all about correct technique and how many rounds you send down range (ie practice, practice and more practice!)\n\nThe Cougar was designed as a more compact alternative to the full-sized Beretta 92 service pistol in order to offer a compromise between concealability, ease of carry, accuracy and firepower.

Most people get the MOI because (if im not wrong) the prices for both are roughly the same and with a MOI or an ALL PAKISTAN license you can take ur weapon wherever in Pakistan. There are two ways to apply for a license. You can either fill in the form ur self which is available at [url]http://www.pakguns.com/procedure.php.[/url]\nHowever as the page recommends, getting a license yourself is complicated and tiring. So it is suggested that you go to a dealer you pay him his commission plus the license fee and he will do it for you. This will save you time and you will probably end up getting ur license alot sooner. To choose a reliable dealer, go the the dealer review page, you will find plenty of reviews regarding particular dealers around the cities. \nFor your license you need a photocopy of you NIC card and two passport size photographs.\nIn my opinion, I will advised you not to buy a used gun unless you know and trust the previous owner.

While the purpose of barrel is to give direction and required energy to the bullet / projectile and in case of rifles, to impart spin stability to the projectile / bullet. The length of barrel controls the duration for which a projectile or bullet is exposed to the pressure of gases produced (due to burning of charge). Longer the barrel more presure a bullet is subjected to, more pressure it is subjected to more muzzel velocity it will have and more muzzle velocity it has flatter the trajectory it will have. If the trajectory is flatter even if you are wrong in range estimation you will still be able to hit the target, so if this is what you call accuracy, I tend to agree with the statement, else in my humble opinion length of barrel does not have to do some thing with accuracy.\n\n    Please also remember that there has to be a very fine balance drawn or what they call a happy blend of muzzle velocity, wear and tear of barrel of barrel, recoil, weight of barrel, material to be used for bullets, effects desired at target end, economy etc etc. You simply can not subject a bullet to enormous pressures to make it shoot flatter or simply can not keep extending the barrel to achieve more MV. If a bullet is subjected to more pressures than it is designed for to sustain it tends to shatter due to centrfugal forces and excessive wear and tear, apart from either damaging or reducing the life of barrel.\n\n There is another statement in ballistics which I qouted earlier as well in some thread and it says that once the projectlie leaves the muzzel, if the pressure behind the projectile is equal to atmospheric pressure the projectile will achieve very long range, but for this you need a barrel many hundereds of meters long which is practically not possible.\n\nI hope I have been able to answer your question in my humble capacity.', 0, 1, '111.68.99.107', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3231, 81951);

Also, when you chamber the weapon the hammer will also ride back and put the weapon in single action mode (unless the safety is engaged).  \n\nA side advantage of the DA/SA system is the decocker, but the main reason is to allow safe ready carry of the weapon while chambered.

The small size of the .22 WMR has allowed Kel-Tec to squeeze 30 rounds into the double-stacked magazine (a new original design), yet maintain a comfortable grip size.[/i]\n\n[i]The PMR-30 has a unique hybrid blow back / locked breech recoil system. In order to accommodate a wide range of ammunition, the pistol automatically adjusts between locked breach and blowback based on internal pressure.

This maintains high pressure in the barrel for a longer period of time. This high pressure can prevent extraction during recoil because the gas pushes out against the brass and presses it into the chamber wall. Shooting Log report that the PMR-30 has a fluted chamber to prevent this type of extraction problem. The gas enters the flutes and counterbalances the pressure against the case wall and also acts as a lubricant.1[/i]\n\n[i]The PM-30''s frame is aluminum. The slide and barrel are steel.

(whole scheme is quiet similar to Baikal of Russia, since China to some extent still operates as the old communist USSR).\n\n[b]Norinco used to buy CF98 from this company under the designation Norinco NP42 and Norinco CF98 (two versions for export diversification, otherwise absolutely same thing), stamp their logo on it and export it (similar to Baikal, its just an export name). however after the imposition of export embargo on Norinco (its name popped up in an illegal arms deal), many export oriented companies were created (on similar setup such as norinco and baikal) to work around the embargo and Entercon was one of them. just like norinco, its just an export name. the company (CHANG-FENG MACHINE MANUFACTURING) that designed the CF98 is still the only company engaged in its production.[/b]\n\nRegards', 0, 1, '110.37.63.139', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2575, 82395),

The main problem is that in those days the pistols that only had serial numbers were considered as pak made originally they were not so some dealers punched some letterings by themselves as done on my pistol or maybe its original lettering some models have that kind of crrapy lettering even though they are original ones.Even now when I show it to people at first glance they say that its a pak made but after inspecting it they admit it as an original.On these type of pistols only the serial no were originally factory punched.Even in the forum a friend called it as a pak made.But this thing is a beauty with almost brand new looks clean shining chrome barrel (the barrel was originally blued but I polished it to give a cool look)you cant get this type of originality in any darra made TT as I worked as a gunsmith myself I surely can recognise an original from a non original one.And another proof if this was a pak made pistol it should have rusted to hell because this pistol was placed by an Idiot(my fathers friend)in a dirty store room for 7 years I just got it this year it had very slightly rusted at some places and the barrel is as new as an untouched onewell I think this gun has fired not more than 30 rounds i''ve only fired 9 rounds through it.But now this gun is like my first love I take great care of it and the special thing about it is this is my first gun.[quote=AK47]Zahid sb, a beauty, indeed.

That said, you cannot say that the Toyota Corolla assembled at Indus Motors is a "Pakistani car". Its just not possible, because the majority of the major parts such as engine, gearbox, transmission etc comes from Japan. All we do is put it together and put on our general tyres and our locally manufactured seats in the cabin - A minimal contribution. That way we could import a Hummer H2 and stick some tires on it to say that it is "Made in Pakistan".

Actually I am looking for a .308 and I,ve already laid hands on a Mk-IV (the paratroopers rifle) which fires a 303 round. A good telescope on this very handy rifle shall make a good edition. So on the heavier side of calibres I will be INSHALLAH well stocked. I shot an Ibex with 3006 and I know it is damn good, however, to me a .308 outclasses 3006 at relatively longer ranges......... say 200 Meters plus, both in terms of sustained MV and power. The availability of practice ammo for both is again not a concern. For actual shooting one can buy the best available for any caliber one intends using. So this brings us back to the point of lighter calibers. My aim was to look for smaller calibers for the hunt which one goes for frequently like deer, para etc. In that context how is the availability of ammo for .243 and its economic effects? Do you really require separate rifle twists for 55 grain bullet and separate number of twists for 105 grain bullet. I learnt that 1: 10 would fire the heavier as well as the lighter bullets too.

(dont know much about it )\nand what about shotgun pallets is it same or have different impact??[/quote]\n\nBazkhan sir, basically if you fire a bullet up at say 1000fps, it goes to the top of its ceiling where the velocity become 0fps. Then it turns around and starts accelerating towards the earth (9.8ms*s). The speed it hits the ground with is exactly the speed that you shot it up with. (Principle of Conservation of Momentum/Energy). However a much lighter shot load, such as 4, 6, or 8 number buck shot, will get influenced by air resistance and because of their having less weight, would have less momentum, so it shouldnt do much to you; maybe just make the place it hits sting a little. However, SG/LG cartridges act the same as rifle or handgun projectiles due to their increased an rather substantial weight.\n\nHope this helped.\nRegards,', 0, 1, '116.71.39.89', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3269, 82812),

Non of the recognized dealers will be spoiling their good reputation, trying to sell you a piece of crap and earn a few thousands extra bucks out of the deal. So, my friend, relax a bit, take your license along, and feel free to check different weapons over there, note their models, and if you need further information or reviews, we''ll be more than glad to reply your questions to the best of our ability.

[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]For the petitioners, Barrister Ali Zafar argued that the process for issuance of arms licenses, ownership of the firearms, their sale and purchase and exchange as well as issuance of ammunition all have been prescribed under Pakistan Arms Ordinance 1965 and Arms Rules of 1924. Mr Ali said that only way to amend the said rules to bring the same in line government scheme of computerization of the licenses, is through the gazetted notification which has not been pursued by the government. The government, he contended, has instead, issued directions in the form of publications in the newspapers requiring all the arms license holders, who were issued licences prior to January 1, 2011, to surrender their arms licenses to Nadra and that they should move application for securing the new licenses. The counsel assailed this direction describing the same illegal and without lawful in as much as that no notification has been issued for this purpose and that directions in question also do not contain any rules for transfer of the firearms or issuance of the ammunition. The counsel appreciated the step of computerization of the licenses however he stressed that the process should be contained in the said Rules as they deal with all aspects of the matter including possession, transport, sale etc. He said without this being in place the entire scheme of the Ministry of Interior to for computerisation of the licenses will be futile and will amount to violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioners.

Locally made plywood is well enough for the project and you will find lots of designs on internet. Fiberglass cloth is also available locally and epoxy too.

He called upon Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice the object he loved most. Ibrahim answered the call and offered to sacrifice his son. Today too, God is testing and trying the Muslims of Pakistan and India. He has demanded great sacrifices from us. Our new-born State is bleeding from wounds inflicted by our enemies. Our Muslim brethren in India are being victimized and oppressed as Muslims for their help and sympathy for the establishment of Pakistan. Dark clouds surround us on all sides for the moment but we are not daunted, for I am sure, if we show the same spirit of sacrifice as was shown by Ibrahim, God would rend the clouds and shower on us His blessing as He did on Ibrahim. Let us, therefore, on the day of Eid-ul-Azha which symbolizes the spirit of sacrifice enjoined by Islam, resolve that we shall not be deterred from our objective of creating a State of our own concept by any amount of sacrifice, trials or tribulations which may lie ahead of us and that we shall bend all our energies and resources to achieve our goal. I am confident that in spite of its magnitude, we shall overcome this grave crisis as we have in our long history surmounted many others and notwithstanding the efforts of our enemies, we shall emerge triumphant and strong from the dark night of suffering and show the world that the State exists not for life but for good life.\n\nOn this sacred day, I send greetings to our Muslim brethren all over the world both on behalf of myself and the people of Pakistan. For us Pakistan, on this day of thanksgiving and rejoicing, has been overshadowed by the suffering and sorrow of 5 million Muslims in East Punjab and its neighborhood. I hope that, wherever Muslim men and women foregather on this solemn day. They will remember in their prayers these unfortunate men, women and children who have lost their dear ones, homes and hearths and are undergoing an agony and suffering as great hand cruel as any yet inflicted on humanity. In the name of this mass of suffering humanity I renew my appeal to Muslims wherever they may be, to extend to us in this hour of our danger and need, their hand of brotherly sympathy, support and co-operation. Nothing on earth now can undo Pakistan.\n\nThe greater the sacrifices are made the purer and more chastened shall we emerge like gold from fire.\n\nSo my message to you all is of hope, courage and confidence. Let us mobilize all our resources in a systematic and organized way and tackle the grave issues that confront us with grim determination and discipline worthy of a great nation.\n\nPakistan Zinda-o-Paindabaad', 0, 1, '116.71.170.210', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3311, 83295),

It was a blow back operated weapon which fired much lower powered 9mm rds and these had extra hard primers because of being blow back operated , the breach block used to be very heavy with a fixed firing pin and it fired from an open bolt, pulling the trigger sent the heavy bolt forward under spring pressure and rebounded after the firing and obturation  was over.\nWhen the MP 5 was introduced the old ammo would not cycle the MP 5 and there would be frequent misfires. Then the whole ammo lot was gotten rid off and the new MK 2 Z was introduced in the mid seventies. The new round is the proper 9mm round and can be used in the MP or pistols.\nThank you  and Regards  Gillani Sahab', 0, 1, '119.154.49.137', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3302, 83401),

I will try to cover some - I know I am bound to forget MANY things...  So here goes.\n\nWe need to look at ourselves as a society - what we want?  I have been half-heartedly in this business for over ten years now.  Most of my customers do NOT like the fact that my company logo is on the weapon.  They prefer the letters GLOCK to be written.  There seems to be something about impressing the other person which is in our veins.  Most of us who can''t afford the real thing still love to go out and buy something thats a copy with the name on it.  \nDealers... ahhh dealers, some in Pakistan are good and honest.  Others well, I won''t go there.  But I do have a good question for those who buy desi maal.  Why is it that when a dealer sells a TT (just an example) and states "life time guarantee" don''t we go beat his f.....ing butt when the gun breaks for a replacement?????   Someone please tell me this.  I have even tried to ask customer this who was buying a TT for the fifith time at this shop and the dealer was telling him "lifetime guarantee".  What the heck does it mean?  Does it mean that for the lifetime the dealer has you the customer by the kehonez?  I guess so because even though they seem to be charging a lot we still don''t get what we paid for and we still keep going back.\nFrom a business view point the second thing that bothers me the most is that even if someone takes the time to develop something proper - we as a society seem to knock down the product stating its no good or it costs too much for Pakistani.  I have been told many a times to lower the price of my products.  After going through this mess for over two years and not really making a profit.  I had had enough, I raised the price drastically and stopped using dealers.  I now only sell out of the factory and at my price, no samples, no gifts, no need to hear the stories of how I may receive the so called BIG ORDER!!!  My price is fixed - pay it and leave or just leave.\nNow regarding manufacturing, there are many hurdles one has to conquer to I guess be successful, and I am sorry to state that no one over the past 50 years has been successful.  We are not discussing old factories like DSA (They have been around for over 60 years).  Firstly, where does one get a manufacturing license?  Some say, the PM, others say, Pres., then there are others who say Home Department or R Block Interior Ministry, Ministry of Commerce and so on so on.  All these avenues have been either a dead end or B.S..  Option two is to buy a license from an existing manufacturer; the rates are too high or one has to relocate to Peshawar... ha, NOT interested.\nThe cost of land is too high if one does get the manufacturing license somehow.  Then we get to the machines, up to four axis cnc machines are allowed with authorization.  Who authorizes?  see above paragraph.  Anyways, plenty of dealers in lahore, one can purchase a used machine from there.  Need atleast two, money well spent?  NO.  Not enough educated CNC operation people here.  Yes, DSA has MANY CNCs but only 5% are being utilized or less.  Labor in Pakistan is cheap, so one can do with out CNC and use jigs on milling and also try out investment casting.\nMetallurgy is a very good issue, most of the manufacturers are now using proper metals; however, proper metals or alloys cost much much more than the usual stuff... a little over 250/rs per KG (and this covers either the frame or two slides if you are careful), equate that with the quantity of say 500 and one starts to see the costs spiral upwards.  When all these costs add up not to mention the hardships, it doesn''t feel good to hear "nahin yaar ay maal bohot mengha hai!!"\nSo to conclude most dealers are making do with cheap stuff, compromising quality here and there.... but we WILL get there someday.... of this I have no doubts.  As far as the foreign clone manufacturers, well they too are going through this mess with quality, ie see the cz75 (not the original Czech) at the isb gun club, it nearly fell apart on a customer.\nWhat the manufacturers here need is proper organizational (government) support WITH input from the people of their desire(s) - there-in-lies the successfull relationship for all of us.', 0, 1, '58.65.157.53', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3296, 83519),

It was a blow back operated weapon which fired much lower powered 9mm rds and these had extra hard primers because of being blow back operated , the breach block used to be very heavy with a fixed firing pin and it fired from an open bolt, pulling the trigger sent the heavy bolt forward under spring pressure and rebounded after the firing and obturation  was over.\nWhen the MP 5 was introduced the old ammo would not cycle the MP 5 and there would be frequent misfires. Then the whole ammo lot was gotten rid off and the new MK 2 Z was introduced in the mid seventies. The new round is the proper 9mm round and can be used in the MP or pistols.\nThank you  and Regards  Gillani Sahab[/quote]\n\nThanks again for such a detailed information, Sir. This clears the doubt.

Ive a point to proove with a 92FS clone that has past 2000 rounds of hard hitting POF, norinco, wolf and a lots of local reloads, without it falling apart.. good going as it never broke its extrator either. I knew of their general traits so got a firepin made exclusively for it on NIB gun without waiting for a failure first. Though 2000 round mark is not to show the durability and reliability of the gun realtime, but if you examine the slide internals, i mean all stress taking areas, i.e locking block, slide''s locking block recesses, rails, breach area, feed ramp, frame hinges and on top of all slide to frame fit! they remained unchanged till now, just as they were on NIB gun... This is some serious shyt I must confess, regardless of what usual desi opinion abt the local stuff is.\nAbout the startlers, which just blow up on your face, well they are a reality here.

I will try to cover some - I know I am bound to forget MANY things...  So here goes.\n\nWe need to look at ourselves as a society - what we want?  I have been half-heartedly in this business for over ten years now.  Most of my customers do NOT like the fact that my company logo is on the weapon.  They prefer the letters GLOCK to be written.  There seems to be something about impressing the other person which is in our veins.  Most of us who can''t afford the real thing still love to go out and buy something thats a copy with the name on it.  \nDealers... ahhh dealers, some in Pakistan are good and honest.  Others well, I won''t go there.  But I do have a good question for those who buy desi maal.  Why is it that when a dealer sells a TT (just an example) and states "life time guarantee" don''t we go beat his f.....ing butt when the gun breaks for a replacement?????   Someone please tell me this.  I have even tried to ask customer this who was buying a TT for the fifith time at this shop and the dealer was telling him "lifetime guarantee".  What the heck does it mean?  Does it mean that for the lifetime the dealer has you the customer by the kehonez?  I guess so because even though they seem to be charging a lot we still don''t get what we paid for and we still keep going back.\nFrom a business view point the second thing that bothers me the most is that even if someone takes the time to develop something proper - we as a society seem to knock down the product stating its no good or it costs too much for Pakistani.  I have been told many a times to lower the price of my products.  After going through this mess for over two years and not really making a profit.  I had had enough, I raised the price drastically and stopped using dealers.  I now only sell out of the factory and at my price, no samples, no gifts, no need to hear the stories of how I may receive the so called BIG ORDER!!!  My price is fixed - pay it and leave or just leave.\nNow regarding manufacturing, there are many hurdles one has to conquer to I guess be successful, and I am sorry to state that no one over the past 50 years has been successful.  We are not discussing old factories like DSA (They have been around for over 60 years).  Firstly, where does one get a manufacturing license?  Some say, the PM, others say, Pres., then there are others who say Home Department or R Block Interior Ministry, Ministry of Commerce and so on so on.  All these avenues have been either a dead end or B.S..  Option two is to buy a license from an existing manufacturer; the rates are too high or one has to relocate to Peshawar... ha, NOT interested.\nThe cost of land is too high if one does get the manufacturing license somehow.  Then we get to the machines, up to four axis cnc machines are allowed with authorization.  Who authorizes?  see above paragraph.  Anyways, plenty of dealers in lahore, one can purchase a used machine from there.  Need atleast two, money well spent?  NO.  Not enough educated CNC operation people here.  Yes, DSA has MANY CNCs but only 5% are being utilized or less.  Labor in Pakistan is cheap, so one can do with out CNC and use jigs on milling and also try out investment casting.\nMetallurgy is a very good issue, most of the manufacturers are now using proper metals; however, proper metals or alloys cost much much more than the usual stuff... a little over 250/rs per KG (and this covers either the frame or two slides if you are careful), equate that with the quantity of say 500 and one starts to see the costs spiral upwards.  When all these costs add up not to mention the hardships, it doesn''t feel good to hear "nahin yaar ay maal bohot mengha hai!!"\nSo to conclude most dealers are making do with cheap stuff, compromising quality here and there.... but we WILL get there someday.... of this I have no doubts.  As far as the foreign clone manufacturers, well they too are going through this mess with quality, ie see the cz75 (not the original Czech) at the isb gun club, it nearly fell apart on a customer.\nWhat the manufacturers here need is proper organizational (government) support WITH input from the people of their desire(s) - there-in-lies the successfull relationship for all of us.[/quote]\n\nAssalaam Aleekum \nCan you please tell me about your line of work. \nBest Regards\nVik', 0, 1, '115.186.67.15', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3296, 83613),

I don''t see anyone here stating that they would rather buy a Pak made HK over the Glock.  \nFurthermore as much as I would like to boast about the quality of our MPs being made in wah, they are still of no match to German quality or Austrian quality, whether they be PDWs or conversions of sorts.  The current rate for pb licenses are hovering at around 70k and add to that a USED MP from Wah which is currently over 230k not less than that.  Yes, one does save money by lugging around a heavy much bigger desi weapon.  In this case its the NPB licensed firearm which converts from handgun to a cqb weapon (I am NOT going to discuss auto kits here nor am I going to discuss the issues of much cheaper less stability option of butt stocks which by the way are legal due to the fact that the weapon is still the same unless one alters the working mechanism... ie auto switch!).  As for NEW M4s for 450k - there are NONE out there.  But there are those ((most) including you Abbas bhai) here who prefer the best - whether or not its affordable/justifiable/feasible is another issue.  One can see on YouTube to their heart''s content what compliments people have to say about these kits.\nI can truthfully state here on this forum what I have seen with Dr. Zakir AND 12Gauge present as to what the Serbian and the turkish quality is like after MINOR usage - I will bet everyone will be getting rid of/selling their stuff right away if I post the pictures and/or write about them in detail; when you visit Isb next time I will try and show you one piece - you also own one of them (I am not talking about the CZ999 - though much can be said about it as well).\n\n[b]P.S.  I didn''t post the price to sell the kit on this forum as I know that its not allowed, I merely answered some of AK47''s questions regarding barrel and what the cost(s) would have been.  As for this thread - I posted to show what UNIQUE item I had recently obtained.[/b]', 0, 1, '115.186.140.154', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3297, 83967),

If already discussed, please provide link.[/quote]\n\nI know after my post you will be bombarded with the different suggestions, you just have to strip the gun i.e slide, barrel, main spring etc clean with Brunox giving special attention to the area where slide moves on frame. Brunox will work as cleaner n lubricant or you can use seperate lubricat (moderately) after cleaning.\nOnce you are finished with cleaning, lubrication & assembling the gun you will feel the difference (specially if gun had grease on it) while racking the slide. \nTo my openion thats all you need to do before getting KINKY with your new gun ;)', 0, 1, '110.36.8.88', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3342, 84122),

The guy survived it, however final report of [u]internal damage[/u] has not been concluded yet. The .30 cal bullet from his own TT went into him from right side hip and came out from the rear in same position. A direct cross, and he was VERY lucky not to have hit any internal organs directly, yet there is a doubt about the proper functioning of his right sided kidney or tube that connects kidney with bladder. I''m not into the right medical terms, but this is what I understood from his family. I got a chance to see his wound, and it was about SAME size on the front as it was from the back. TT rounds do not create greater cavity at exit points I think, coz of the sharper profile and higher velocity I guess.\n\nThe gun went off from his brother''s hand, not an accidental discharge, as I had firstly presumed. They were sitting opposite each other and he had just cleaned and oiled the gun. His brother, while playing with the gun, pulled the hammer back and obviously didn''t know about the "chambered round", which went off from him, directly into the opposite sitting younger bro. Thanks God, it hit him by the frontal hip side, and not anywhere in the center torso.\n\nI asked the chap, who is hardly 20 years of age, about the instant "feel" of the shot, and quite expectedly he told me that he felt absolutely "nothing" in the first few seconds! In fact, he stood up and walked at least some 30-40 feet towards the gate where he finally fainted and was rushed to hospital. He said the feeling started a few seconds [i]after[/i] the shot, when he started feeling a very HOT kind of ''ball-feeling", like if there was a small, hot ball inside of him. As for present, he was quite fine and no pains, course he has been injected with steroids and pain-killers. He''ll have to stay for a week for daily monitoring, however. And for us another one lesson about THE EMPTY GUN! [i]Never hand over your chambered gun to anybody, never let anyone play with your weapon, especially if you have the habit of keeping a "live" round![/i] \n\nIf you scroll back one page of this thread, there is a picture of the guy who got shot.

The problem with young blood is that it boils very quickly and if one is angry he tends to cross limits, that is why "Ghussa Haram hy". I have seen people using guns for very small arguments only for one reason that they were carrying it. One may land in a very ugly situation if he has weapons readily available. Yes, carrying it in the car once going out (SD) or keeping at home is a different thing all together. However, if you are travelling alone and there is no enemity and no apparent danger as well, then why to carry it. I have also read insane arguments like carrying weapons and killing terrorists and so on. Bro, it is easier said than done. Ask them who are in the business. Remember, if you are alone and overpowered what will you lose? A couple of thousands or a mob. Though it hurts your ego but it is definitely not worth risking life. And also remember, that if you are not alert, which you can not be all the time, the initiative is with the robber to take out gun and demand money. Now with a couple of seconds behind him if you try to use gun, remember bullet travels faster than your actions. I say it out of experience so do not take it lightly. People may have different opinions and may tell you to carry it all along and bla bla bla bla but I do not subscribe to this idea. However, decision remains yours. Make it wisely.

We checked it on homecoming, and found it had crossed through the glass, just above the steering wheel and to the right corner side of the windscreen. Hole was about 1 inch. No hitting splints of glass anywhere inside the car. Lucky night, indeed! Yet, I''d still not recommend shooting from inside the car by any means.

Then it turns around and starts accelerating towards the earth (9.8ms*s). The speed it hits the ground with is exactly the speed that you shot it up with. (Principle of Conservation of Momentum/Energy). However a much lighter shot load, such as 4, 6, or 8 number buck shot, will get influenced by air resistance and because of their having less weight, would have less momentum, so it shouldnt do much to you; maybe just make the place it hits sting a little. However, SG/LG cartridges act the same as rifle or handgun projectiles due to their increased an rather substantial weight.\n\nHope this helped.\nRegards,[/quote]\n\nNicely explained thank you brother, i did fired few rounds on my brothers wedding, it was in big ground no one was around but i inshallah i will not do it again', 0, 1, '90.220.245.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3269, 84738),

Later due to changed geo political scenario it was postponed as Super 7 was to have American Avionics and design concept. With Tianaman Square crisis the equations were grossly changed. Later when in 1998 the PAC and CHENGDU inked the agreement it was agreed that of the total $300 million PAF will pay half the development cost. So our engineers and finances were in the project from day one.\n\n[b]Pakistan Specific Needs[/b]\nThe aircraft could have joined our ranks may be a couple of years earlier but when in late 1990s India acquired Su 30MKIs with Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile launching capability Pakistan put up the need for a JF 17 to be a BVR plateform as well. The avionics were relooked into and Chinese SD 10 (first Chinese BVR missile) was incorporated into the system. \n\n[b]The Engine [/b]\nOther delays originated because of engine problems when Russia presumably under Indian commercial pressure refused to allow re export of their RD 93 engines. Though matter has been resolved with initial batches having RD 93, Chinese are also working on their own engine for this project.\n\n[b]Avionics[/b]\nThe first 50 aircrafts may have Chinese avionics and later will be fitted with European systems. Italian Grifo S 7 radar is suspected to end up on JF 17 as same is being manufactured in Pakistan.\n\n[b]Seat[/b]\nSomebody quipped about the seat, as a matter of fact PAF as well as many airforces around the world favour British Martin Baker zero zero ejection seats.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nSince Pakistan was involved in the project from conception stage and its engineers and designers participated in aircrafts come up so it can be safely termed as a Sino Pak venture. Manufacturing of few assemblies here and few there for economic reasons can not be termed as a reason concluding that we have just bought it and not produced it.\n\n[b]139[/b]', 0, 1, '115.186.142.7', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3245, 85167),

Easier logistics are the by product and not the driving force.

The wide spread use of 7.62 x 51 weapons in the armed forces of Turkey, Iran and Pakistan can be taken as case study points as ball three at critical junctures of the cold war have remained part of SEATO or CENTO or both. \n\nThis all while the most powerful NATO member USA was using 5.56 x 45 as standard ammo with its M 16s and employed  .45 caliber M3 submachine guns for CQB roles.

Long distances remain the domain of bigger calibers. 5.56 essentially is a 300 Yds or meters weapons. Most of the infantry engagements are restricted to these ranges thus generally it was felt to remove the additional kill power thus reducing the caliber, recoil, improving accuracy and creating magazine/soldier''s capacity to carry additional ammo.

It is an extremely small unit of measurement, with 437.5 grains equaling one ounce. (Or 7,000 grains equals one pound, if you prefer.) This small unit of measurement is used because firearms are precision instruments, and the ammo they use must also be made to extremely close tolerances.\n\nThe markings on the boxes of ammo referred to the weight of the bullet alone. For each popular caliber, the ammo manufacturers offer a variety of different bullet weights, bullet shapes, and even what material the bullet is made of. This can be rather confusing at times.\n\nAnother source of confusion is the fact that different manufacturers might offer cartridges that use the same type of bullet, but each company usually likes to load different amounts of powder. This means that rounds with different brand names might have the same bullet info on the box, but you will find that they shoot different when you try them out.\n\nSpeaking in the broadest possible way, lighter bullets tend to be more accurate at short and medium range because they move faster coming out of the gun and have a flatter trajectory so it is easier to aim precisely. They tend to lose their speed relatively quickly, so they will also hit downrange targets with less force than heavier bullets.\n\nThose heavier bullets are trickier to get precise shots at medium range, but air resistence will effect them less than their lighter brethren. They will retain more speed. over longer distances, and so will hit distant targets with greater force.\n\n2)Muzzel velocity: \n\nA gun''s muzzle velocity is the speed at which the projectile leaves the muzzle of the gun. Muzzle velocities range from subsonic (below 330 m/s / ~1080 ft/s) for some pistols to more than 1,800 m/s (~5910 ft/s) for tank guns firing kinetic energy penetrator ammunition. The latter velocity is close to the limit achievable with chemical propellants. The velocity of a projectile is highest at the muzzle and drops off steadily because of air resistance.\n\nIn conventional guns, muzzle velocity is determined by the quality (burn speed, expansion) and quantity of the propellant, the mass of the projectile, and the length of the barrel. A slower burning propellant needs a longer barrel to burn completely, but can on the other hand use a heavier projectile. A faster burning propellant may accelerate a lighter projectile to higher speeds if the same amount of propellant is used. In a gun, the pressure resulting from the combustion process is a limiting factor on projectile velocity. A balance between propellant quality and quantity, projectile mass and barrel length must be found if both safety and optimal performance is to be achieved.\n\nLonger barrels give the propellant force more time to work on propelling the bullet. For this reason longer barrels generally provide higher velocities, everything else being equal. As the bullet moves down the bore, however, the propellant''s gas pressure behind it diminishes. Given a long enough barrel, there would eventually be a point at which friction between the bullet and the barrel, and air resistance, would equal the force of the gas pressure behind it, and from that point, the velocity of the bullet would decrease.\n\n3): Ballistic Coefficent: \n\nIn ballistics the ballistic coefficient (BC) of a body is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight. It is inversely proportional to the deceleration—a high number indicates a low deceleration. BC is a function of mass, diameter, and drag coefficient.', 0, 1, '116.71.41.127', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3390, 85824),

Contrarily if most of the hand guns can not produce around 800 ft lbs (thought necessary to kill a human being)so why to carry them but the fact is that most of the hand guns despite this would kill a human being. Similarly there are many disagreements amongst the hunters also about the killing potentials of various calibers e.g people take bison also with handguns through well placed shots, while on the other hand people recommend heavier calibers for such games. So it is a discussion of own experiences/opinions as well as experiences of other peoples etc etc. I think shot placement is also a very important factor.

The conversion started about two years back and although there are huge logistic problems they are converting to it. The rifle remains the same with same magazines only the barrels are bieng changed. It fires a 115 gr bullet at 2650 fps and has good long range performance as well.\nI am with you; I would love to stick to the 762 and the good old G3[/quote]\n\n1.I thought they complained about contant jamming in Vietnam.Cured with better bolt carrier and gas chamber and rigorously implemented cleaning  cleaning\n\n2. A single round in center mass is capable of producing Hydrostatic shock.\n\n3.For the 5.56-mm round, maximum penetration occurs at 200 meters. At ranges less then 25 meters, penetration is greatly reduced. At 10 meters, penetration by the M16 round is poor due to the tremendous stress placed on this high-speed round, which causes it to yaw upon striking a target. Stress causes the projectile to break up, and the resulting fragments are often too small to penetrate.\n\nEven with reduced penetration at short ranges, interior walls made of thin wood paneling, sheetrock, or plaster are no protection against 5.56-mm rounds. Common office furniture such as desks and chairs cannot stop these rounds, but a layer of books 18 to 24 inches thick can. Wooden frame buildings and single cinder block walls offer little protection from 5.56-mm rounds. When clearing such structures, soldiers must ensure that friendly casualties do not result from rounds passing through walls, floors, or ceilings.\n\nArmor-piercing rounds are slightly more effective than ball ammunition in penetrating urban targets at all ranges. They are more likely to ricochet than ball ammunition, especially when the target presents a high degree of obliquity. \n\nAlthough most structural materials repel single 5.56-mm rounds, continued and concentrated firing can breach some typical urban structures. The best method for breaching a masonarywall is by firing short bursts (three to five rounds) in a U-shaped pattern. The distance from the gunner to the wall should be minimized for best results—ranges as close as 25 meters are relatively safe from ricochet. Ballistic eye protection, protective vest, and helmet should be worn. \n\n4.The 6.8 Remington SPC (Special Purpose Cartridge) was developed by Remington and the US military as a replacement for the 5.56mm NATO cartridge in specialized situations. The cartridge is based loosely on the .30 Remington case, and uses a 115 grain bullet of .277 inch diameter. One of the parameters of the design was that it must be compatible with the M4/M16 family of rifles, along with current squad automatic weapons and light machine guns, with minimal modifications.  The specifications call for a bullet speed of 2650 feet per second from a sixteen and one-half inch barrel, delivering 1715 foot-pounds of energy, and a six hundred meter effective range. Basically, the US military wanted a round that was smaller than the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge, but delivered more terminal effect than the 5.56mm. The end result was the 6.8 SPC.\n\n[b][color=red]So far there is no confirmed adoption of the 6.8 spc caliber by the U.S. military.[/color][/b]\n\nWhile there are many rumors of evaluations of the cartridge by several major Federal and local law enforcement agencies, it has not been confirmed to be in service with any official agency yet.', 0, 1, '116.71.220.184', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2825, 85944),

The 5.7x28mm was designed as a caliber for PDWs (Personal Defence Weapons) which I believe bridges the gap between SMGs and assault rifles. The FN Five-seveN was introduced as a companion sidearm to the P90. In today''s modern world, criminals and terrorists have relatively easy access to body armor, which the 9x19mm cannot defeat. Hence, the armor piercing capabilities of the 5.7mm come into play.\n\nAs far as the comparison of the 7.62x25mm and the 5.7x28mm goes... Anyone know why exactly the 7.62x25mm was actually adopted? The Russians didn''t want to develop separate machinery for sidearms, and wanted to make the barrels from the existing rifle machinery (7.62mm). Plus, the TT-33, one of the few chambered for this round, has quite a recoil. On the other hand, recoil of the Five-seveN is lesser than that of a 9mm. Btw, I am not belittling the 7.62x25mm and its capabilities, but the fact remains that the 5.7x28mm was developed ground up for a special purpose. The Chinese could have utilized the 7.62mm as a special purpose cartridge, however they chose to create the 5.8x21mm, which is somewhat similar to the bullet on discussion.\n\nThose interested in the FN Five-seveN and the 5.7x28mm, check out:\n[url]http://www.gunblast.com/FN-FiveseveN.htm[/url]\n[url]http://www.shootingtimes.com/handgun_reviews/fnusg_021207/index3.html[/url]\n[url]http://gunsandammomag.com/cs/Satellite/IMO_GA/Story_C/One+Hot+Number?packedargs=recid%3D1198098376868[/url]\n[url]http://www.shootingtimes.com/longgun_reviews/st_fnsfirepower_200811/[/url]', 0, 1, '110.37.16.72', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3385, 85975),

I do agree with your answers that dealer would simply not allow to x-ray their products  but my idea is  when ever someone went to their dealer with intention of buying someone  or even already bought some good clone, in this senior i think he can take few close-up photos (not saying strip down the gun) but photos of ever corner for example;  opened chamber photos from different angles, Barrel, Engraved writing etc etc ..  like so and post it with its specifications. \n\nI am also not saying  just by looking these photos our expert or senior members start giving their expert opinions how to differentiate this clone from its original model.  It could be done after physical check so If any one would get this chance of handling any good clone (request a person who has the clone) so field strip it and compare it with original hand by hand (if possible )  when will give their feedback of differentiating b/w both  even it can be a weight difference, like so  (it could be any thing)  and then if possible will post some photos as well. \n\nThen i am sure even a single clue will be helpful in differentiate the Clone from its Original .   Even if separate thread will only have good Clones phone/details all in one place (without having difference analysis) so everyone specially new users/inexperienced will get alarmed/be-aware that so and so clones are already in the market if they are looking for original things. \n\nWhy i am emphasizing on this just because i really felt the need of this particular separate thread after looking  Anthrax''s topic about Stoeger''s amazing clone.  A month back i was making my mind that when ever i will have that License/budget i can think about having Stoeger and previously i was only thinking about PT92/99  BUT now after knowing about that Stoeger clone, I would batter be careful while buying it (surely will need some expert advise or his presence).

I''m hitting a little towards 4 o''clock - 5 o''clock region. Checked and learn''t that I''m probably gripping it too tightly.[/quote]\n\nthats great brother.. you seem to find it correct. May be your fingers are gripping inconsistently over the front strap of grip...but theres another reason which probably is most likely in your case and my case as well as i do that too. So I am with you.\nAlso do check by dry firing(use snap cap if you like) that while under stress, do you, when pulling trigger, pull the pistol as well in direction of the motion of trigger. Most of us are right handed, pistol in right hand when being pulled at trigger with index finger will move a bit to right and a little low! and hence 4 or 5 O'' clock hits to the bullseye. \nIdeally this should not happen, we can control it by first practice dry firing to see the cause, ofcourse if find the issue then you can eliminate it. As the term suggests Squeeze the trigger, it actually Squee-eee-zee - ing. To me it is to over come the pre-travel and letting the shot off while consistently focusing on the front sight untill you are surprised by the shot. \nAlso we can overcome this easily by practice in slow shooting, but after a couple of shots, adrenaline kicks in. Theres kinda shake-in thingy that starts at this point, so it is the break time, for a couple of long breaths to relax and then start again. This will also become better with practice and so on.\nBeing good at Sqee-eee-ze''-ing the trigger everytime in quick successive shots is the next thing which will require further practice but make sure your earlier step is cleared repeatedly to conform with consistency.\nBro SA, these are my own findings and tips which I practice with and just for info I am an amateur shooter with 85% way to go.', 0, 1, '119.152.133.125', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3342, 86619),

They''re very humble, fair and honest people. They mostly deal in local guns but for the past couple of months they''ve also started importing weapons specially from Turkey. \n\nIn the imported weaponry, they have shotguns from Hatsan Escort. In pistols, currently they have the Norinco NP22, Kanusi-s, Stoeger Cougar, Tangfolio Viper 9mm (Not the old design - the new one with rails) and Ghost TR-01. In clones, they''ve got the best Beretta 92FS clone that you can get in Lahore. They also have the Stoeger clone. \n\nThey also have reasonably priced ammunition and currently I think they have Elley and Shaheen brand shotgun shells. In pistols, they have a lot of .30 and 9mm bullets. Everything is reasonably priced. They also have a wide variety of holsters and knives. \n\nI took [b]SlayerJatt[/b] today to their shop and he was very pleased.

I also understand that a range report without pics virtually means nothing but it just did not occur to me while I was firing that I should take the pics also. Sorry for that.  Most of the time forgot to take my camera along and actually, remained too focused on firing alone. \n\nIn all, I fired around 800 rounds of different ammo in the last 20 days. This included 50 rounds of Chinese Blue Box (2008 lot), 100 rounds of POF 1Z (2006 lot) and around 650 rounds of POF 2Z (different lots from 2002 to 2008). The results were as following.\n\n-  There were no misfires with any of the three ammo.\n\n-  5 jammed out of 800. All of them were POF 2Z and all were within first 200 rounds that I fired from this pistol. No jams   afterwards (this could have been due to faulty cartridges or the experts may comment better whether its a fault or a fluke).\n\n-  Initially, the weapon was continuously firing below the point of aim when I was aiming with rear and front sights aligned / levelled. Then I kept front sight tip a little higher than the rear sight and the pistol started firing quite accurately.   \n\n-  The weapon turned out to be a very accurate one. I fired 50 rounds each from CF98, Baretta 92FS, Akdal Ghost and NP22 (there is no specific reason for selecting these pistols, infact they were the one available to me :)). CF98 and Baretta 92FS were at par and quite accurate, followed by NP22, Akdal Ghost was an unimpressive last. Distribution of these 50 rounds was 10 from 30 ft, 10 from 50 ft, 10 from 75 ft and 20 rounds (2 mags of 10 each) were fired in a rapid fire test. Though I am not a good firer but I could make around 4-6 inches group from 30 ft and 6-8 inches group from 50 ft with CF98 & 92fs. \n\n-  CF98 (along with Beretta 92fs, offcourse) was most impressive in the rapid fire (in which I draw the weapon from holster and fire 10 rounds on 2 target in a sequence of 2,2,2,2,1,1. ie, I change aim 6 times. Reload and again fire 10 rounds in the same sequence. I try to complete two magazines in 20 seconds. (I understand this is not a standard test and something specific to my style of firing). The balance, pointability, recoil and accuracy of CF98 was quite satisfying during this test, far better than Akdal Ghost and NP22.  \n\n-  I found that fire was most accurate with POF 2Z. Bullets were continuously hitting below the point of aim while firing with Chinese and POF 1Z ammos. Chinese was better than POF 1Z but no match to POF 2Z from which I was achieving a good number of bull hits. This may have been because I fired more of POF 2Z ammo and got used to it but still, there was a visible difference. \n\n-  There was no apparent wear and tear to the gun after firing around 650 rounds of POF 2Z which I believe is a +p ammo (please correct me if I am wrong). If that be so than CF98 fired +p ammo better than standard ammo. \n\n-  No problems were faced with the safety lever. It was absolutely smooth. (a member mentioned hardened safety lever of CF98 in one of the posts). \n\n-  Though a little big for CC, I found it convenient to carry CF98 in a side holster. It is light and does not make a mess of the belt / trousers. Wearing jackets in winters takes care of the size, however, during summers, it would show quite easily. \n\nI have just tried to pen down the facts as they occurred and  have mostly refrained from passing any judgments because I do not think I am qualified enough to do it. I leave it up to the experts and senior members. Again sorry for not posting the pics :(.\n\nregards', 0, 1, '210.2.170.238', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2575, 87084),

You are most welcome to disagree but closing a valid thread which does not violate any rules or norms of the forum is not the way forums are run. We are all here to discuss and share information for mutual benefit. \n\nNo one has yet disputed the relevant sections of the Crpc, hence my argument that the relevant order restricting carrying can be taken out very easily. Second why is the home department issuing carry permits in relaxation of Section 144 allowing concealed carry if there is no ban on carrying in the first place. Also if memory serves me right, a couple of months back a number of cars were stopped on Shahrah-e-Faisal and people arrested for carrying arms in their cars, i saw that news report myself.

Although modern ammunition hardly ever spoils in a time period of 10 or 20 years for that matter, if you store it correctly it will still be shiny new and fresh whenever you take it out for use. I bought half a case of Federal 9mm''s two years back and left it lying around.

You are most welcome to disagree but closing a valid thread which does not violate any rules or norms of the forum is not the way forums are run. We are all here to discuss and share information for mutual benefit. \n\nNo one has yet disputed the relevant sections of the Crpc, hence my argument that the relevant order restricting carrying can be taken out very easily. Second why is the home department issuing carry permits in relaxation of Section 144 allowing concealed carry if there is no ban on carrying in the first place. Also if memory serves me right, a couple of months back a number of cars were stopped on Shahrah-e-Faisal and people arrested for carrying arms in their cars, i saw that news report myself. C''mon guys i''m not saying you are wrong but there are two sides to every argument.[/quote]\n\nI agree with @ [b]Glocky[/b] to keep this topic open for the following reasons,\n\n1- It will keep us (specially who travel a lot all over Pakistan and CC their arms) updated regarding carrying our arms or any change/new notifications.\n\n2- It will also keep us updated regarding "MODE" of law peoples and licensee''s status in different province regardless of notifications (situation on "GROUND ZERO").\n\n3- We can learn from the members who got some experience on the "POLICE NAKAS" and tips and tricks of "MEN OF LAW".\n\nSecondly, for the clarity, the discussed MOI notification is especially issued to address the confusion of licensee''s status in case of imposition of SEC 144 in different parts of Pakistan (if you read the last part of paragraph# 2 of the letter and the paragraph #3 explain how).\n\nI always carry my arms in out city trips, in last few days I traveled to RWP/ISB and Pewshawar with my 9mm in a small hand bag under my driving seat, didn''t got any trouble.\n\nHere are few tips I learned on NAKAS and regular check posts.\n\ni) Keep your license in your pocket not in the bag/?? you keep your arms (keep your license with you especially when you are leaving your vehicle in the i.e.parking etc. and your arms in it) , \nii) If asked or discovered, tell them what it is and handover your license first, \niii) Make sure the bullet  is not in the chamber when you are traveling in the city or on the main roads,\niv) Always remove the magazine (if loaded) before you hand over your arms for serial/license # verification to the relevant persons.\nv) Don''t handover (even show) your arms to uniformed/UN-uniformed person on the NAKAS at unexpected places i.e. village roads, roads in unpopulated areas etc. Unless you are sure that they are real police  (ask for ID if possible especially when UN-uniformed).\nvi) Be confident and keep it in your mind that you are not carrying anything illegal(If it is not of-course  ;) ). \nand best of luck.[/quote]\n\nI also agree with Glocky: Sindh Government Issuing a carrying permit as well as endorsing 144 exempt permission on MOI book, means it is required. Moreover, I recall last year Eid-ul-Azha''s notification in which, all allowed 144 permit should be treated cancel for 3 days of Eid to avoid any accident regarding Qurbani Skins. \n\nMoreover, according to previous reference in which MOI instructed punjab government, not to ask for carry permission was too old and we surely dont know its current status.  \n\n@  A.

Dry it with a hair dryer (your wife will be rather upset ) and  it will work fine.\n\n2nd Method\n\nTake a very fine polish which is used after painting cars and the final rubbing is done with it; its name is Fine Polishing Paste without silicone top quality painters use it after final polishing. (it is not the usual compound ) STP Scratch Out  car polish will also do fine\n\nAdd to your media and run the your vibratory tumbler without cases for an hour or so. If you also starch and dry it; it would give very good results. The paste is water soluble and I would recommend wiping your shiny cases with a wet cloth after cleaning to remove any trace of the polish. Try using a mix of pistol/revolver cases with the rifle cases some how all cases  come out with more shine this way.\n\nI have only one RCBS inertia puller and a set of collet puller also by RCBS so I can not spare it but I will find one  for you.\nNow the Trimmer.

I have 2 shotguns 2 rifles (one inherited) and a pistol from before, however my grandfather (may he rest in peace) used to get all the paper work done for me. I just had to go and buy the guns and play around with them! :) He had put an application for another licence in for my brithday present and I had put one in just a few days after that. So now I have two licences, but i want to buy a really good gun to carry on me for now, and as for the other licence, I dont want to buy another gun right now because there is no point as i am going off to uinversity in a few months. \n\nTherefore I would like to keep one licence free at home so that when i come back to Pak i can use it then. Is there no way to keep a licence without a weapon for more than 6 months??? can you just send the licence in to the DCO after 6 months and tell him that you did not buy a gun??? :S I would have though that that would not be a problem.... :S', 0, 1, '59.103.196.103', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3020, 87257),

Sure it was fun shooting this time again as it has always been before but I always emphasize on learning something new every time I attend a session of shooting. We had brief time at our private range, even though there is no proper facility there as such but I still like to call it my RANGE. \nI used my own pistol only this time which happens to be a 92FS Pak made clone, my bro and friend enjoyed shooting with a Zastava CZ999 9mm pistol. \nWe fired a total of 200 rounds in as much as under 90 minutes. Details of which are as under:\nCZ999 - 50 rounds of Norinco blue box "Factory 71 headstamp" ammo.\n92FS clone - 80 rounds of POF MKIIZ, 8 rounds of Norinco FMJ blue box (311 factory ammo), 130 rounds of local reloads (Baber Ammo Factory)\n\n[b]Impression on Shooting and my findings:[/b]\nWell as I mentioned earlier, I always like to have something new learned on shooting. But this time I just went backwards. Surprisingly I was not able to stop blinking my eyes while shots went off. This thing in particular I have given much time and practice to overcome lately. Also I would like to add that I dont use ear muffs at all. This is to ensure that I get used to keep my eyes opened with my gun going boom in my face everytime, keeping in mind SD scenarios where I would require to put a bullet in the intended path crucially. I know that many of new shooters do that but having it learnt and then unlearn later on is depressing. But still it was fun to shoot anyway, got some better groups as well on the paper. Next time, I plan to practice again and will hopefully make myself watch the climbing muzzle, i.e. front sight going up and then coming back to the place where it started to jump from. You know why it is important, mainly because for a follow-up shot, if your eyes are not tracing the movement of front sight GO UP and back DOWN during firing cycle, you cannot always put your pistol in the same plane/axis to where it was, as on the previous shot.\nMy friend and my bro did some fun with CZ999 and they say they were enjoying so I was kind of letting them enjoy this time.\n\n[b]Impression on Ammo:[/b]\n----------------------------\nCZ999 fired all Chinese blue box ammo, without a single FTE or FTF or misfires. 50 rounds were fired, all butter smooth.\n92FS clone did its 1st round of 8 shots of norinco 311 stamped FMJ ammo, then with 80 rounds of POF MKIIZ without a hitch. Consistent recoil and muzzle blast on every shot. MKIIZ went cycling like premium grade ammo in my clone. I noticed that even the ejection of brass is typical and consistent every time POF round was cycled. \nNow the local reloads by Baber ammo factory, well out of 130 rounds, 2 rounds required a double action pull to get them launched, but what they really did bad was, they produced a lot of soot which was like pouring down in the breech area, frame rails, and even guide rod and just about every where in the pistol. I also found some yellow tinkles/particles sticking here and there in my slide and breech. It was real dirty ammo and also gave me about 10 FTE due to inconsistent pressure peaks, or may be there was issues with those cases.\n\n[b]Video Links:[/b]\n-----------------\nMyself with Pak made Beretta 92FS clone \n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI14ADlxt0c[/url] \nNote: Please forgive me, if you dont like my slide not sticking back on slide stop after every last round in the mag was fired, this is due to stiff slide release lever. It has gone really stiff after installation of Hogue wrap around grips actually. After all you know its a clone.\n\nMy friend and Bro trying out Zastava CZ999 Scorpion Pistol\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PazuFcrD-0[/url]\n\n[b]Some Target Results:[/b]\n----------------------------\nWe had only 7 target charts prepared, so a lot of shooting was done on the last chart target which ended up drilled a zillion times by me.

(77729, 2288, 67093, 'AK47', 162, '', 1260764382, '@Selfdefence26...........As you may see from my above post, I clearly wrote in my opening line, that some members may oppose the suggestion, and I was a bit reluctant to give it. Why? Because, I find it a bit [i]unethical[/i], coz it''s actually only a "proforma" deal, but was intended for someone in absolute emergency, if he neither can afford a local gun, OR, doesn''t WANT a local gun, yet wants to save his license. Course, if non of these two things are of concern, one should just buy a cheap local gun and have it entered, and thus avoiding the unethical part of a pro-forma deal. Having gone clear on this, let me now reply the remaining of your question.\n\nNothing is 100% in our country, yet many things are 99.5%! I personally have seen this before my eyes, when a cousin of mine was short of funds for a while, didn''t want to buy or keep a local gun, yet wanted to preserve his license. The dealer cooperated and sold him a desi gun on papers only, stamped his license with details of the gun and he had it later registered at the concerned authorities. He saved his license. 6 months later the guy went for a genuine Beretta M-9, in the +200K range. Course a guy like him didn''t want Desi stuff in his possession, yet was only concerned about his license. Authorized and registered, low profile dealers, selling mostly local guns, have the least of scruples with [i]audits[/i] from any department whatsoever, coz these local guns have no proper back-track in records, like the imported ones with all details from export, import, retail. So, it''s not any big issue for the dealer at all. Bear still in mind, we''re in Pakistan.\n\nRegarding your second question about a new weapons entry on "another" page of the license, I think you misunderstood something in my post. I didn''t mean two entries on the same license on different pages. Course not. That is not possible at all. What I meant is, that when you buy any new weapon, initial entry stands cancelled, by automatic process, subsequent entry on another page stands valid, by automatic process. Hence, another page, course you cannot have two weapons entered on the same page, nor two valid entries on one license. That is not legal, but the other thing I mention is normal and fully legal procedure.\n\n\nBear in mind, that you''re always allowed to change your weapons on the same MOI license, provided you stay within the range of weapons allowed on it. In old days, and especially with provincial licenses, I think this used to be a problem. With an MOI, you can change your weapon as frequently as you wish, just ensure that a separate application to the DCO office for record entrance of newly acquired weapon is forwarded every time, and endorsed also. This is no problem at all. I hope now you''re clear, and I repeat, this is only an emergency solution, yet fully practical, though I''m not a supporter of it. The forum is based for exchange of experience, and I''ve experienced above method working out positively in favor of a license holder, whose license otherwise would have stood cancelled.

Sure it was fun shooting this time again as it has always been before but I always emphasize on learning something new every time I attend a session of shooting. We had brief time at our private range, even though there is no proper facility there as such but I still like to call it my RANGE. \nI used my own pistol only this time which happens to be a 92FS Pak made clone, my bro and friend enjoyed shooting with a Zastava CZ999 9mm pistol. \nWe fired a total of 200 rounds in as much as under 90 minutes. Details of which are as under:\nCZ999 - 50 rounds of Norinco blue box "Factory 71 headstamp" ammo.\n92FS clone - 80 rounds of POF MKIIZ, 8 rounds of Norinco FMJ blue box (311 factory ammo), 130 rounds of local reloads (Baber Ammo Factory)\n\n[b]Impression on Shooting and my findings:[/b]\nWell as I mentioned earlier, I always like to have something new learned on shooting. But this time I just went backwards. Surprisingly I was not able to stop blinking my eyes while shots went off. This thing in particular I have given much time and practice to overcome lately. Also I would like to add that I dont use ear muffs at all. This is to ensure that I get used to keep my eyes opened with my gun going boom in my face everytime, keeping in mind SD scenarios where I would require to put a bullet in the intended path crucially. I know that many of new shooters do that but having it learnt and then unlearn later on is depressing. But still it was fun to shoot anyway, got some better groups as well on the paper. Next time, I plan to practice again and will hopefully make myself watch the climbing muzzle, i.e. front sight going up and then coming back to the place where it started to jump from. You know why it is important, mainly because for a follow-up shot, if your eyes are not tracing the movement of front sight GO UP and back DOWN during firing cycle, you cannot always put your pistol in the same plane/axis to where it was, as on the previous shot.\nMy friend and my bro did some fun with CZ999 and they say they were enjoying so I was kind of letting them enjoy this time.\n\n[b]Impression on Ammo:[/b]\n----------------------------\nCZ999 fired all Chinese blue box ammo, without a single FTE or FTF or misfires. 50 rounds were fired, all butter smooth.\n92FS clone did its 1st round of 8 shots of norinco 311 stamped FMJ ammo, then with 80 rounds of POF MKIIZ without a hitch. Consistent recoil and muzzle blast on every shot. MKIIZ went cycling like premium grade ammo in my clone. I noticed that even the ejection of brass is typical and consistent every time POF round was cycled. \nNow the local reloads by Baber ammo factory, well out of 130 rounds, 2 rounds required a double action pull to get them launched, but what they really did bad was, they produced a lot of soot which was like pouring down in the breech area, frame rails, and even guide rod and just about every where in the pistol. I also found some yellow tinkles/particles sticking here and there in my slide and breech. It was real dirty ammo and also gave me about 10 FTE due to inconsistent pressure peaks, or may be there was issues with those cases.\n\n[b]Video Links:[/b]\n-----------------\nMyself with Pak made Beretta 92FS clone \n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI14ADlxt0c[/url] \nNote: Please forgive me, if you dont like my slide not sticking back on slide stop after every last round in the mag was fired, this is due to stiff slide release lever.

Though the experts would be able to comment better but IMHO, there could be two reasons for these jams (in my case, it was failure to feed every time and happened with POF 2Z ammo only). In fact I should have given these observations when I mentioned 5 jams in my report but since my post was already becoming a thesis so I preferred to be brief. \n\n1. Faulty ammo, as already mentioned by senior members.\n\n2. The magazine. In fact this was one area where I found CF98 lacking. The quality of magazine does not go at par with the rest of the pistol. In my case, the magazine cover (a removable lid at the bottom of the magazine) of both the magazines would open up a bit while firing (less than half a centimeter). As you can observe by moving the magazine cover, it does move the follower spring and follower base plate a little which might effect the bullet feeding (I am not sure about it). After having observed this thing, I used to check every time before fire that magazine cover is in its proper position. I am still not sure whether those 5 jams in my case were due to movement of magazine cover or due to faulty ammo or due to any other reason, but it has not happened even once in last several hundred rounds that I have fired with my pistol. Only happened initially, however, experts can comment better. \n\nregards', 0, 1, '210.2.170.238', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2575, 87510),

As this pistol is replacing the Chinese Army and Police pistols in every service. Even their SWAT teams and Special Forces are using this pistol. It can be called as the workhorse replacing the good old Chinese TT 30 bore. \n\nSo if they had made a finishing like other western pistols, the cost would have gone considerably high as can be seen in western pistols. hardly a good pistol comes below 40K, nearly all are pretty expensive. So China looked for a pistol which may not be having as high grade finishing as western ones but rest of the attributes should be at par with western ones, which i believe the experience of our forum members and the test of Gilani Sir shows. \n\nThe barrel life is also kept low compared to western ones, as we all know how many of us fire how much rounds from our pistols through out its life, very few of us fire hundreds or thousands of rounds through out the life of our pistols, and these very few are also rare in other words. So by reducing the barrel life also, the manufacturer reduced its price. \n\nThus the above attributes made CF98 into a pistol whose finishing is not at par with western ones, but performance can be at par with them. As Chinese Army is practical one, they wanted a weapon which can work when needed, not a weapon admired for its looks or finishing. \n\nI believe it is the one of the two popular pistol in circulation with rotating barrel mechanism, the other being Cougar 8000. \n\nChinese must have tested this mechanism to its limit after which they adopted this mechanism to be a standard for their new standard service pistol.\n\nAnd as for your second part, well Chinese use their QSZ-92 with only DAP rounds in service, which i believe is more powerful round then +p standard ammo.\nEven the booklet of CF98 says it can fire DAP rounds, so if it can fire DAP rounds, it should easily be handling the +p ammo too. \n\nRegards', 0, 1, '116.71.214.49', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2575, 87602),

Why? Because, I find it a bit [i]unethical[/i], coz it''s actually only a "proforma" deal, but was intended for someone in absolute emergency, if he neither can afford a local gun, OR, doesn''t WANT a local gun, yet wants to save his license. Course, if non of these two things are of concern, one should just buy a cheap local gun and have it entered, and thus avoiding the unethical part of a pro-forma deal. Having gone clear on this, let me now reply the remaining of your question.\n\nNothing is 100% in our country, yet many things are 99.5%! I personally have seen this before my eyes, when a cousin of mine was short of funds for a while, didn''t want to buy or keep a local gun, yet wanted to preserve his license. The dealer cooperated and sold him a desi gun on papers only, stamped his license with details of the gun and he had it later registered at the concerned authorities. He saved his license. 6 months later the guy went for a genuine Beretta M-9, in the +200K range. Course a guy like him didn''t want Desi stuff in his possession, yet was only concerned about his license. Authorized and registered, low profile dealers, selling mostly local guns, have the least of scruples with [i]audits[/i] from any department whatsoever, coz these local guns have no proper back-track in records, like the imported ones with all details from export, import, retail. So, it''s not any big issue for the dealer at all. Bear still in mind, we''re in Pakistan.\n\nRegarding your second question about a new weapons entry on "another" page of the license, I think you misunderstood something in my post. I didn''t mean two entries on the same license on different pages. Course not. That is not possible at all. What I meant is, that when you buy any new weapon, initial entry stands cancelled, by automatic process, subsequent entry on another page stands valid, by automatic process. Hence, another page, course you cannot have two weapons entered on the same page, nor two valid entries on one license. That is not legal, but the other thing I mention is normal and fully legal procedure.\n\n\nBear in mind, that you''re always allowed to change your weapons on the same MOI license, provided you stay within the range of weapons allowed on it. In old days, and especially with provincial licenses, I think this used to be a problem. With an MOI, you can change your weapon as frequently as you wish, just ensure that a separate application to the DCO office for record entrance of newly acquired weapon is forwarded every time, and endorsed also. This is no problem at all. I hope now you''re clear, and I repeat, this is only an emergency solution, yet fully practical, though I''m not a supporter of it. The forum is based for exchange of experience, and I''ve experienced above method working out positively in favor of a license holder, whose license otherwise would have stoodThcancelled. Thanx.[/quote]\n\nThanks AK fr yr detailed reply. What I want to know is that when a dealer gets an old gun off yr licence, it means that he has purchased it from you (lets assume in this case that u have sold yr old gun to a dealer) right?. If this is the case, then IS THERE AN ENTRY OF THIS PURCHASE made on yr licence?. e.g "Purchased a 30 bore Khyber Arms pistol model no.12678 from Mr.X".\n\nIf there is no mention (endorsement) of the old purchase of the gun on yr licence by the dealer then I assume that the old purchase entry on the licence STANDS CANCELLED and the entry fr the new gun puchased from the dealer will be the valid one on yr licence and this new gun will have to be registered to the DCO Office right?.\n\nWhat about the OLD GUN which was registered in the DCO OFFICE?. Do u have to inform the DCO OFFICE THAT THE OLD GUN WHICH WAS ENTERED IN THEIR RECORDS IS NOW SOLD AND THAT REGISTRATION IS VOID?\n\nSo the procedure is go to dealer, sell yr old gun buy a new one. Dealer will enter new weapon details on yr licence, get yr new gun registered at DCO. Will the purchase of the new gun automatically mean that the old gun has gotten rid off (i.e. sold) and now the new gun is the fresh entry which will be valid?.\n\nPls clarify to remove confusion.\nThanks,\nSD.\n\n(BY the way, I have a friend who would like to avail this " Paper purchase receipt deal". what dealer in Karachi would be cooperative enough to initiate this process?. any names or references appreciated.)', 0, 1, '202.70.146.243', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3020, 87668),
