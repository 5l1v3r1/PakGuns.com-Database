Barrel Release System which helps in easy breaking of the Barrel and also acts as a safety feature\n2. Micro adjustable Truglo rear sights (good quality sights)\n3. Combo Scope Mount Rail\n4. Automatic / Manual Safery\n5. Gold plated quattro trigger\n\n\n\n\n[b]01-05-14\nLabor Day[/b]\n\n\nI had it all planned in my mind last night, how I was going to review the Hatsan Mod 99.  today at 7:00 am in the morning I went to my rooftop and did so. The Sun was unforgiving.\n\n\nI had set up the target at 15 meters, cocked the Airgun, loaded a pellet, aimed and aligned for a good sight picture, pulled the trigger to realize that I had not disengaged the Automatic Safety.I pushed the knob in and tried again. Guess what, I still couldn''t press the trigger. I thought perhaps I did not disengage the safety properly so I pulled it back and pushed it back again. I tried and I tried but the gun wouldn''t shoot. I pointed the gun in the air and pulled the trigger and TWWWANGGG it shot... \n\n\nI did not jump to any conclusions and very patiently I loaded another pellet only to find the same incident repeating again. My 2nd, 3rd - 15th and 16th pellets all were fired in the air and I found the trigger to be extremely hard.\n\n\nI failed to understand the situation, I thought maybe the safety is not disengaging properly so I pulled and pushed the safety knob / switch several times but it had absolutely no effect.\n\n\nI figured that it was not the safety, something was up with the trigger. I would load the gun and pull the trigger, it would act as if the safety was active. I released the trigger and tried again a few times. In 3-4 attempts the trigger worked and the gun shot. Of course with this kind of a setup it was humanly impossible for me to even imagine about making a group. \n\n\nAfter shooting approx. 30 pellets, I realized that the trigger was slowly getting better. The gun would fire 3 shots normally, then the trigger would get stuck for the next 4 shots, then 1 shot normal, stuck for 2 shots. This kind of cycle kept repeating and I kept shooting.\n\n\nI am not going to jump to any conclusions at this stage and give mod 99 benifit of doubt. Perhaps and most probably the gun needs time to break in.\n\n\nBelow is a picture of the best 10 shots I did today from 15 meters while sitting on chair and elbow resting on my knee with open sights.\n\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/f5oyj5zf9/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/f5oyj5zf9/IMG_20140501_100419.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThe trigger got stuck in the first 3 shots but did not create problems in the remaining 7 shots. The different is clearly evident. \n\n\nAnother fellow member also got mod99 couple of months back and faced a similar kind of issue.

Anyhow I will be checking it on Chrony very soon.\n\n\nWell, that''s all for now, all new developments will be posted and I`ll keep you guys updated.', ''),

Older cards didn''t havd these papers when card licences were issued. You should''ve got ministry approval first for change of weapon, then done sale and purchase, produced these receipts to ministry and then submit to Nadra. That should''ve bypassed the DCO altogether because DCo primarily approves the issuing of licence in first instance. Lahore DCO, for example, I doubt signs every single weapon change licence as new weapon indraj at DCO office is a short process that doesn''t require DCO signatures.\n\nBy getting DCO to sign on MOI weapon change form prior to ministry''s approval, it has caused your issue.

For a 300 bar rated PCP the 1st fill will be at 300 bar and every fill thereon will drop in pressure both in the cylinder and the PCP.\n\nMy carbn fiber filling setup has cost me approx 20k because when dealing with such high pressure I want to be a 100% sure about the quality and life of my equipment. Any mishap will spell disaster so I honestly will NOT opt to buy a low cost cylinder. Also getting it tested is another area where I would not take any chances. \n\nOnce that whole setup is obtained i know of places in Karachi where you''ll get cylinders filled up for Rs 1000.

Diana P1000 give you more shots between 200bars to 100bars of pressure compared to hatsan BT65. So you can very well just fill it up to 200bars and enjoy it like any other gun that has maximum 200bar pressure capacity.

Overall daudsons you have done a fine job in introducing a handgun that will give a tough time to other multinational competitors in it''s league cause for me i believe in "Be Pakistani Buy Pakistani" logo and there are many other like myself that believe in this logo provided the product meets the standards.

(599375, ' [B]02-05-14\nThe day of Strike / My Sickness Continues[/B]\n\n\nMore than half the city is shut today due to strike. My Office was open but I didn''t go since I wasn''t feeling well today as well. However my restlessness kept increasing and my patience kept going down. I took out the Mod99 from it''s case and made up my mind to open up the gun for a DIY project.\n\n\nI started opening the gun, took the screws out, separated the barrel and trigger mechanism from the Stock. I had made up my mind to figure out (if not fix the trigger) that what exactly is the problem in the gun and why was the trigger behaving the way it was.\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/93406tnrp/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/93406tnrp/IMG_20140502_110651.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nThe stock of this gun has been extremely well done on the inside. Some very fine craftsmanship skills\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/an9c57w5x/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/an9c57w5x/IMG_20140502_112240.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/bqtgh6gt1/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/bqtgh6gt1/IMG_20140502_112245.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/rqc40qcut/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/rqc40qcut/IMG_20140502_112252.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nI noticed the pinkish gooey grease on the trigger mechanism so my auto response was to clean this. I cleaned the entire trigger mechanism with WD40 to remove any rust if present or excess grease (even though there was none visible and all parts were shinny). In the process in noticed something. I figured out the reason why the trigger would not release the sear.\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/cb8hjva1h/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/cb8hjva1h/IMG_20140502_110715.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/5tpl0czo5/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/5tpl0czo5/IMG_20140502_110752_1.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nObserve the picture below, within the circle you can clearly see the safety engaged and a metal part is preventing the trigger from travelling.\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/yog86oaz9/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/yog86oaz9/IMG_20140502_112907.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nUpon disengaging, this metal part is suppose to be removed from under the trigger, enabling it to travel and release the sear. What was happening was the even upon disengaging the safety, the metal part was not moving away properly and the trigger was getting stuck in the part. Pulling and releasing the trigger 2-3 times would eventually put this metal part in its place and the trigger would work.\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/6hyfjaydx/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/6hyfjaydx/IMG_20140502_112922.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI filed this metal part a little bit, oiled the safety mechanism with some gun oil and engaged / disengaged the safety approx 30 times. This exercise brought much improvement. Upon disengaging the safety, the metal part would come in its place, enabling the trigger to work.\n\n\n[URL="http://postimg.org/image/pplkfwgph/"][IMG]http://s26.postimg.org/pplkfwgph/IMG_20140502_112931.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nI put the stock back, bolted the gun back and experienced the actual Quattro trigger of Hatsan. It''s really nice, very soft and I really like the quattro trigger. I shot some pellets through the gun and out of 15 times, only once the trigger got stuck. I am very sure that with a bit more shooting, this problem will go away completely . Perhaps the gun had been lying for some time and the metal parts just got a little stiff.\n\n\nThat''s all for now...', ''),

Thanks buddy, and you are doing the right thing by waiting for 500 pellets before scoping it. as far maintaining your airgun is concerned, it''s slightly more complicated. You may clean the barrel with a pull through after every 500 shots approx. 5 Pull through should do the job, the first 3 damp with WD40 and remaining completely dry. Make sure the barrel is totally dry before shooting any pellets. Avoid any oiling around the breach seal as it can distroy it. Also make sure no Oil goes in the Gas Chamber as it may damage the seal inside as well. You may wipe the visible metal parts with oil to protect them from rust but make sure its just enough, any dripping or flowing oil might leak into the cylinder and damage the seals. Very little oiling of the trigger mechanism can also be done after separating the barrel from the stock.\n\nBasically...Yes Airguns do require Oiling but some parts can be damaged if exposed to Oil so just have to be a little careful in the process.', ''),

I''m not a handgun expert but at the same not a novice either. I need your expert opinion on how to be sure of it''s originality. I''m uploading few pics where i got in doubt (Check finesse of the word AUSTRIA and "K" of the Glock logo). Apparently the handgun looks original but writing on the slide rail seems doubtful. if its a clone; it''s a near perfect clone. Serial number mentioned under the muzzle end on silver strip is CAC5916. can it be verified over the web? another issue is that 9mm Luger HP bullets pose problem in feeding into chamber. FMJ works fine.

The regulated pressure remains the same as long as the pressure in the airgun cylinder is higher than the pressure the regulator is set for. Which means the regulator has two major advantages:\n\n1. All shots above the reg setting are at a constant pressure (more constant velocity).\n\n2. Higher usable number of shots because you can fill the gun to higher pressure (300b e.g.) and still get the same velocity as you''d get at 120b. In other words, the velocity curve is flat over a greater range of cylinder pressure as compared to an unregulated gun.\nThe best unregulated airguns have a usable range of approx. 100b (say 210 - 110b) and even then the velocity spread is not as tight as in a regulated airgun.', ''),

Higher usable number of shots because you can fill the gun to higher pressure (300b e.g.) and still get the same velocity as you''d get at 120b. In other words, the velocity curve is flat over a greater range of cylinder pressure as compared to an unregulated gun.\nThe best unregulated airguns have a usable range of approx. 100b (say 210 - 110b) and even then the velocity spread is not as tight as in a regulated airgun.[/QUOTE]\nSalam yes Bro that''s the advantage of the regulator. More consistent shots and can be filled to higher pressure too.\nSH.', ''),

(599642, ' Well GunFun my understanding is a little different from what you have written above. \n\nAny unregulated PCP even if it is tuned properly, in a full cylinder start at a muzzle velocity below the peak , the FPE increases as the pressure drops in the cylinder, and then starts to decline as you take more shots .... To get consistent FPS the trick is to start and stop the shot string where this curve is most flat i.e. "the sweet spot".  The issue is that this sweet spot is rather small as far as cylinder pressure variance is concerned (Also in terms of number of shots that can be taken). To expand the sweet spot gun manufacturers usually try to minimise the pressure variation in the cylinders by increasing the total volume of cylinder and keeping the pressure variance to mimum (between 200 and 100b, compared to regulated guns that can take 300 to 100b) . But still the number of shots taken at the sweet spot are only a few if you are looking at consistency of target shooting.  The more consistent you want your gun to be the smaller the sweet spot you will have. \n\nOf course the other approach is to regulate the pressure to the release valve through entire regulated cylinder pressure range. On the flip side you add one additional component in your gun in the form of regulator this means one more thing that can go bad! \n\nLastly all of the high end PCP guns manufactures have introduced regulators for their Guns either as a standard or as an add-on. FX is selling regulator as add-on ,  Daystate is using electronically controlled air pressure regulator. CaliberGun Cricket is using regulator, Diana has a regulator as well. \n[COLOR=#767676][FONT=sans-serif]\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),
(599643, 'Availability of JSB pellets! With the popularity of PCP guns in Pakistan the appetite for good quality pellets especially developed for PCP is ever increasing. For me nothing works better in a PCP than JSB exact heavy pellets (18.13 grain) both at short and long ranges.  Unfortunately the pellets are not available in Pakistan. Only a limited quantity is imported irregularly which is bought and consumed by the PCP gun users immediately as JSB does not have a Pakistani distributor as of right now.  I would also like to add that JSBs are excellent pellets for break barrel rifles especially their 16 and below grain range. Keeping in view the price point at the international markets I am sure who so ever will start importing them will clean sweep the market in Pakistan.\n\nBut the question is why is there no one importing them in Pakistan?', ''),

I present to you my Taurus 669! 6-inch barrel, the classic 6 round capacity in 357 magnum! This model was a target model by taurus back when it was competing with Smith&Wesson etc. And maybe that''s the reason every time i type taurus 669 reviews on the web, i find people regretting trading this firearm and others telling people never to get rid of it. Not even a single bad review whatsoever! (Kisi ko millay to bata day taakeh main apni gun ko behtar tareeqay say jaan sakoo) I couldn''t take a trip to the range unfortunately, but here''s a link in which the user comments on its accuracy [url]http://castboolits.gunloads.com/showthread.php?136103-My-new-to-me-Taurus-669-357-Magnum-6-inch[/url] . For me however, its a treat to fire! Totally manageable recoil (because i''m too much into arm wrestling) and the bang and power is just WOW!!! I use Armscor ammunition and according to the info on their website and midwayusa they have a velocity of 1894 fps and a muzzle energy of 984 ft.lbs! comparing this with a 44. mag sellier and bellot round with a muzzle energy just above 700 ft.lbs this baby is affordable AND ultra powerful!

(599689, ' 1 - "Majeed Sons - Arms & Ammunition Dealers" are authorized dealers of JSB in Pakistan. Confirmed to me by JSB CZ and Majeed Sons themselves. I contacted JSB in Dec `13 and asked for a quote as I wanted to import 100 tins. They referred me to Majeed Sons who then informed me that they had to cancel a 5000 tin order due to legal issues and were quite pissed at the authorities :p .\n\n2 - Airgun pellets fall under restricted items in the Import Policy Order of Pakistan. A few months back pellets worth approx Rs [B]3.5-4 lac [/B] of several dealers combined were confiscated by customs which to my knowledge have not been released so far.\n\n3 - I personally tried importing JSB pellets hoping a small quantity will slip through the customs, but sadly it got detained never to be released. \n\n4 - The popularity and demand can be judged by the fact that ANY available quantity is sold within a couple of days even at very high prices. I have seen people buying them in the range of Rs 3000-4000 per tin, whereas when I got mine from US 2 years back in personal baggage, each tin cost me an average of approx Rs 1300-1400 if I remember correctly. In Us they still cost the same.\n\n5 - JSB makes very good quality pellets and as stated above the under 16 grain pellets work quite well in springers. I''m yet to see a better pellet than JSB and H&N FTT for springers, my 2nd choice is Crosman Premier after these 2.

(599715, ' Here is my impression of this gun. The gun is very average made. It looks like a toy gun. Sights are good, but the manual says that it has rear adjustable sight with tritium inserts. It''s not adjustable nor it glows in the dark. I charged the damn thing for hours and it didn''t lit-up. Good accessories, love the holster. Magloader is useless. It''s a pretty big and heavy gun then Caracal F. Harder to CC. Mag capacity is good. But couldn''t get the 18th round to go in the mag. The concept of the DA/SA trigger in the striker fired gun is good. But this gun is just not that refined. The trigger pull in both DA and SA is very very heavy. I can''t break the trigger in DA at all. It was that heavy. SA not so much, but i couldn''t fire 10 rounds in a go. My poor trigger finger just gave up. I had to take a break between shots. Maybe it''ll get better after the break-in period. The gun shot pretty accurately. But the trigger was so hard that occasionally my hand started to shake when i squeezed the trigger. Fired hectic 100 rounds through this gun. Don''t have the energy to fire more anytime soon. There were only 2 FTFeeds. 1 in the first mag and 2nd in the second mag. After that no problems. The other issue that i faced with this gun was that it wasn''t throwing the empties very far from me. Couple of shells dropped on my shooting hand and some hit me in my face and cap couple of time. I don''t know what caused that. Haven''t cleaned it yet and will see how much can this gun shoot without getting cleaned. \nHere are some pics:)\n [URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_151953_HDR_zps630993ef.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_151953_HDR_zps630993ef.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152116_HDR_zpsd5a1c594.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152116_HDR_zpsd5a1c594.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152250_HDR_zpsc9c95d82.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152250_HDR_zpsc9c95d82.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152213_HDR_zps18947bd3.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152213_HDR_zps18947bd3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152333_HDR_zpsc4a4a9d8.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152333_HDR_zpsc4a4a9d8.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152404_HDR_zps97059922.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152404_HDR_zps97059922.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1113.photobucket.com/user/bilal_qureshi1/media/20140504_152502_HDR_zps89deb3dd.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20140504_152502_HDR_zps89deb3dd.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),

(599719, ' [QUOTE=Rcpak;437520]Well GunFun my understanding is a little different from what you have written above. \n\nAny unregulated PCP even if it is tuned properly, in a full cylinder start at a muzzle velocity below the peak , the FPE increases as the pressure drops in the cylinder, and then starts to decline as you take more shots .... To get consistent FPS the trick is to start and stop the shot string where this curve is most flat i.e. "the sweet spot".  The issue is that this sweet spot is rather small as far as cylinder pressure variance is concerned (Also in terms of number of shots that can be taken). To expand the sweet spot gun manufacturers usually try to minimise the pressure variation in the cylinders by increasing the total volume of cylinder and keeping the pressure variance to mimum (between 200 and 100b, compared to regulated guns that can take 300 to 100b) . But still the number of shots taken at the sweet spot are only a few if you are looking at consistency of target shooting.  The more consistent you want your gun to be the smaller the sweet spot you will have. \n\nOf course the other approach is to regulate the pressure to the release valve through entire regulated cylinder pressure range. On the flip side you add one additional component in your gun in the form of regulator this means one more thing that can go bad! \n\nLastly all of the high end PCP guns manufactures have introduced regulators for their Guns either as a standard or as an add-on. FX is selling regulator as add-on ,  Daystate is using electronically controlled air pressure regulator. CaliberGun Cricket is using regulator, Diana has a regulator as well. \n[COLOR=#767676][FONT=sans-serif]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nRcpak Bro.\nYou are right any AIRGUN with out regulator will have a sweat spot.\nthe regged guns will give more shots and are more consistent shot to shot.\nsome people just thing they are clever that''s all but are not and only been playing with PCP airguns less than two years.\nSH.', ''),

(599727, 'CANIK Piranha VS CZ SP01 Tactical Salam All,\nThe other day I was bored and roaming around the forum to see whats new in members lives and I came upon a thread of a fellow member Verve.  Now, Verve has lately gone through or what I believe still may be going through is a little bit of a mid-life-gun-crises.  He keeps on jumping from gun to gun when he should be going for what he has tried and tested and liked.  So I am on this thread where the Canik Shark is being mentioned and somewhere along the posts I read up quality quirks with the Caniks.  Uh, is that right?  Could I be wrong?  I mean granted I am the Sig guy lately rather than the Glock guy going through my own version of identity crises of gun ownership; but, Canik?  Noooway.  I have used this gun, shown this gun, have had amateurs fire this gun with success at the gun club where they have managed to knock down all plates in the first round (a feat that not even my Mastershop can claim!) - and I can''t get that damn thing to JAM!  I refused to clean PG One''s Canik when I had it with me... everyone who picked it up complaint about their hands getting black and their clothes getting dirty - I cleaned it after I think it was 1700 rounds or something like that as everything in front of the trigger guard to the muzzle was covered in black sut (carbon).  Verve has also fired the Canik, and in the first round DID manage a better total of knock down of plates over the CZ SP or the CZ Shadow.  Hmmm, maybe you didn''t have enough coffee or smokes that day Verve when you were firing the CZ?  I know I won''t attempt the accuracy test because some might say I did a biased shoot.  Verve, please do let me know regarding accuracy... or should I say bro ''don''t worry with practice you will get better with the CZ equallying what you can already do with the Piranha''.  Bro, I am being sarcastic please don''t mind.  Either way, I had Verve visit me at the Gun Club today.  He sat with me and spent a few hours whilst we tore apart both guns and started comparisons.\nSo let the games begin... Well, no, you know what?  I will just tell you what you already know and the rest is me blah blah blah....  Seeing is believing and we can also get the rest from Verve.   Both guns are made out of a ISO manufacturing facility, matter of fact the Canik factory seems to have more certifications posted on their site than the CZ factory.  Both of the items are manufactured from die casting (aluminum) to precision Investment casting (wax casting).  Both are using proper metallurgy with xrays and to check for cracks and gas bubbles and the like.\nNow, this is where things do take a turn for the worst for the CZ quality wise.  The outer finish on the Canik - although dirty has had over 1000 rounds through it already yet still looks new - furthermore, I wish I had PG One''s Canik here as thats had well well over 6000 rounds fired through it and one can never tell.  The finish is also a medium shine finish.  The CZ''s more dull, un-used, still looked like it had fired over 1000 rounds through it.  The internal of the frame was not finished rather left sand blasted on the CZ.\nThe barrel tolerances on the CZ will be looser after a few 100 fires because the Zinc coating started to wear off Verve''s new gun barrel already where as in the Canik the barrel is hard chromed and barely showed use.  \nThe factory wire spring meant to hold the slide release in place kept coming out of frame slightly on the CZ.  Bro, glad you tinkered and fixed it.\nThe serrations on the hammer seem better precision cut than the loose cut serrations on the CZ.  The lesser spaced serrations also require more detail to manufacture.\nLook at the precision work on the sear block as well.  The CZ one looks like someone worked on it.  The trigger spring on the Canik sat completely inside its slot whilst the CZ one was bent to the center.  The two springs working the disconnector/trigger bar were not fully reseating to their resting place on the CZ... Bro, good thing you got that cleared.\nThe guide rod was well hmmm the comment I would like to make but can''t on the CZ.... very wavy (up down up down...) where as the guide rod on the Canik was a no nonsense steel.\nThe slide rails on the CZ - see photos.\nThe barrel in the slide movement felt granular in the CZ due to the now fast wearing Zinc coating - where as the one on the Canik was like butter even though this gun was dirty.\nThe magazine bodies... see the precision of the mag body curves on the Canik verses CZ''s I won''t be commenting on it. \nYou know what I am just going to post the photos I want you guys to decide.  I believe Canik here as the upper hand over the CZ anyday... Everyday.  Its lighter, very easy to take apart, very precision built - oh yeah it has no night sights... Damn I am never buying a Canik now - right.\nTake a good look forum members the real great news.  CZ stuff fits right in the Canik, no alterations.  Look at the pictures carefully you may see working hybrids.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-11.jpg[/IMG]\n The top barrel is CZ and the bottom is Canik.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-2.jpg[/IMG]\n The top slide is CZ and the bottom slide is Canik.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-5.jpg[/IMG]\n The top frame is Canik with CZ custom unaltered fitting grips and bottom is CZ frame.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/4-1.jpg[/IMG]\n Top frame is Canik and the bottom is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/5-3.jpg[/IMG]\nTop frame is Canik and the bottom frame is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/6-2.jpg[/IMG]\n Frame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/7-3.jpg[/IMG]\n Frame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/8-1.jpg[/IMG]\n Frame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/9-2.jpg[/IMG]\nFrame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/10-2.jpg[/IMG]\n Frame on the left is Canik and the frame on the right is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/11.jpg[/IMG]\n Top guide rod is Canik and the bottom is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/13-2.jpg[/IMG]\nTop slide is Canik and the bottom slide is CZ.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/14-1.jpg[/IMG]\n Oops!

I visited Khilji today to inspect some scope that I am interested in buying off him for my Mod99. Details will be provided once I do get the scope and mount it. Accompanied by Skywatcher, Foxhound and Ed it turned out to be quite a trip.\n\n\nThe core objective for visiting Khilji today was to check the muzzle velocity of the Modd 99. Below are the readings I got and I am going to compare them to the Gamo Shadow readings.\n\n\n\n\n[B]Hatsan Mod99[/B]\nHighest Velocity:710.2 fps\nLowest Velocity: 687.8 fps\nAverage Velocity:700 fps\nExtreme Spread: 22.4 fps (difference between the highest and the lowest reading)\n\n\n[B]Gamo Shadow[/B]\nHighest Velocity:698.2 fps\nLowest Velocity: 662.8 fps\nAverage Velocity:678.4 fps\nExtreme Spread: 35.41 fps\n\n\n\n\nAs evident, there is not much difference in the muzzle velocities of both the guns on which I would like to add again that Gamo Shadow is a excellent gun in its price but the Mod99 takes lead in:\n\n\nThe trigger of  Mod99 is simple beautiful. Soft and smooth\n\n\nThe Mod99 handles the recoil much better due to it''s wooden body and weight\nBoth the above mentioned points make Mod99 more accurate as compared to Gamo Shadow and also more friendly with the Scope\n\n\nThe Mod99 is built up much more solid as compared to Gamo Shadow but that does not make Shadow a frail Airgun either. It''s just   that Mod99 is tougher\n\nBut it''s unfair to compare the Mod99 with Shadow like that. After all it does cost more than 6-9k as compared to the Shadow. Just mentioned these pointers so as to give you guns an idea of what exactly Mod99 is all about.\n\n\nGamo Shadow still holds its respect in my eyes as a very good buy for its price.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, shot like 35 shots today and Alhumdulillah the Mod99 trigger did not create any problems today. Ed, Skywatcher, Khilji and Foxhound, they all tried the Mod99 so they can be asked regarding their experience as well.', ''),

(599778, ' [QUOTE=Trigger_happy78;437592]Here is my impression of this gun. The gun is very average made. It looks like a toy gun. Sights are good, but the manual says that it has rear adjustable sight with tritium inserts. It''s not adjustable nor it glows in the dark. I charged the damn thing for hours and it didn''t lit-up. Good accessories, love the holster. Magloader is useless. It''s a pretty big and heavy gun then Caracal F. Harder to CC. Mag capacity is good. But couldn''t get the 18th round to go in the mag. The concept of the DA/SA trigger in the striker fired gun is good. But this gun is just not that refined. The trigger pull in both DA and SA is very very heavy. I can''t break the trigger in DA at all. It was that heavy. SA not so much, but i couldn''t fire 10 rounds in a go. My poor trigger finger just gave up. I had to take a break between shots. Maybe it''ll get better after the break-in period. The gun shot pretty accurately. But the trigger was so hard that occasionally my hand started to shake when i squeezed the trigger. Fired hectic 100 rounds through this gun. Don''t have the energy to fire more anytime soon. There were only 2 FTFeeds. 1 in the first mag and 2nd in the second mag. After that no problems. The other issue that i faced with this gun was that it wasn''t throwing the empties very far from me. Couple of shells dropped on my shooting hand and some hit me in my face and cap couple of time. I don''t know what caused that. Haven''t cleaned it yet and will see how much can this gun shoot without getting cleaned. \n[/QUOTE]\nNow after reading this unbiased review by T_H bro, lets hope Verve bro''s tension would be released a bit.', ''),

(599805, ' Dear Sniper Bros,\n\nHas any one of you got replacement stocks for your sniper? Are they available in Pakistan like from Hira and at what cost?\n\nI have noticed a very fine hair line fracture on my stock next to the screw (one near the pistol grip) that holds the adjustable comb in place. I guess I overtightened it since the comb was coming loose after long firing sessions. The plastic collars through which the rod passes cracked first and later passed the stress on the stock frame itself. I have loosened up the screws a bit to release the tension so that the crack does not widen or progress due to the recoiling vibration of the gun.\n\nWas just interested to know about the spare stock incase if I eventually need it later. Also any suggestions how you keep the adjustable comb in its place w/o overtightening the srews.\n\nThanks', ''),

(599807, ' [QUOTE=Surg.Ray;424942]Thought I''d share this: [URL]http://www.weaponsrelated.com/2011/01/how-to-photograph-firearms-and-gear.html[/URL]\n\nHow to Photograph Firearms and Gear\nCamera technology has come a long ways in the past decade, almost anyone can pick up a cheap point and shoot digital camera and take stunning pictures, even professional quality in the right conditions. However people don''t do this, and I don''t know if they think they need more expensive gear or are just lazy, but here are some easy tips to take your still pictures to the next level no matter what camera you are using.\n\n1. DON''T USE THE FLASH\nThe direct flash on the camera destroys more pictures than anything else, and unless you are photographing the license plate of a hit and run driver speeding in to the distance or something like that there is no reason to ever use it. Any kind of light can be used, it''s easiest to take good pictures in good natural lighting but since you can easily adjust the white balance, tone and color later it''s not super important as long as there''s no glare or shadows on your object.\n\n2. Use a Tripod\nEven a cheap $10 mini one will do. When you are taking pictures without the flash you will probably need a longer exposure time, and if you are holding the camera in your hands the photo will be blurry and out of focus.\n\n3. Use the Timer\nLike the tripod, this will remove the variable of movement, even on a decent tripod your finger on the camera will affect the photo. Just set it to the timer as you would with a family photo.\n\n\n\n4. Use a Small Aperture\nThis will increase the depth of field, meaning more of the photo will be in focus at once, which is nice for taking pictures of guns or really anything at indirect angles. This also increases the exposure time so obviously the tripod and timer are not optional.\n\n5. Use a Low ISO\nThis adjusts your cameras sensitivity to light, and has similar effects as using the small aperture, increased depth of field and higher detail. I nearly always use an ISO of 100 on non moving objects. Again, tripod and timer are necessary.\n\n6. Black or White Backgrounds\nThis is always nice especially for guns as it gives you such a clean look. For a black background go get a yard of synthetic black velvet, costs less than $10 at a craft store. Hang it on the wall behind what you are taking a picture of (the further the better as it will be easier to control the light). Try and illuminate the object but not the background. You can use a desk lamp or even a piece of cardboard on the light in the room to block it from hitting the velvet. The background should be pitch black in the photo. White backgrounds are the opposite, get a large sheet of white paper, place it behind the object making sure there are no folds or creases, and put all the light you can on the background rather than the object. You may need to adjust the exposure to make it completely white.\n\n7. Play With Light\nFor both the black and white background photos and most photos really you rarely will get the light perfect the first time. Just try a lot of different things until you like what you see, over time you will get a sense of what light works for photos.\n\n\n8. Don''t Put a Knife or 12ga Shell in Your Trigger Guard\nGo to any forum and you will see a ton of photos like this. Spend 10 seconds thinking about a way to prop up the gun at your desired angle without it being visible in the photo. I''ve had some precarious setups but it''s worth it not to have that kind of distraction in the photo.\n\n9. Edit your Photos\nAt the very least you should resize them so people don''t have to spend 30 seconds loading them, but almost every picture can benefit from a bit of tweaking. Photoshop and Lightroom are great but you don''t need them, there''s an amazing free program called Paint.net that will allow you to do adjust the hue, saturation, etc. At the very least use the auto corrects and resize the photo.\n\n10. Take More Photos\nThe more you take the better you will get. Once you take some nice ones you will be more motivated to take more as well. Try as many different ideas as you can too, the best thing about digital is you can take an endless amount and delete them in seconds if you don''t like them. You really have no reason not to take more, so go for it.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n:) happy to see your post sir very informative very knowledgeable for me thanks for sharing these kind of stuff .', '');

(600027, 'A (small) Incident This happened a few months back, and i was hoping that my PG bros could give their opinions on it, and if i behaved correctly or not.\n\nSo I was outside with my car, in a partially built society airgunning with my shadow 1000. I had already made sure nobody was at risk, and everything was safe. ( i also had a large pile of bricks about....8m high to serve as a backstop)\nso i fire away, and had gotten some looks from people behind me, but they peacefully went on their way after a glance.\nabout the point were i had fired off a good 30 rounds (was re-zeroing gun) this...person comes up to me and asks me what i am doing.\ni tell him that i am target shooting/nashanabazi\nhe then tells me i cannot do this here and he is the property owner of the entire society (it happened to be fermanite society on the south side of lahore. anyone who had been there would tell you how undeveloped it is. only the main roads have houses.\n\nThen he proceeds to barrage me with questions from where i was, my fathers name etc etc (he could tell i am a minor). i declined to answer everything except my first name, and the general location of where i lived. He asked further, but i told him that was all he will get. Then he starts talking about what i am doing, how it is bad,and so on in a slightly raised voice. I tell him what i am doing is completely legal, as air rifles dont need licences. nor am i threatening anyone at all. He once again says i cannot do so on this as it is private, but stops the second i tell him that each and every road of pakistan is considered public property, and to stop me is both unlawful and in court he would be thrown out,so i told him go ahead and try,we will see who is right in civil court. ( i was getting kinda nervous as the amount of people had increased from one to about 6, so i bluffed my hand )\n\nso then, seeing as trying to intimidate me wasn''t getting anywhere, he tried to ask my credentials again, and i declined. After another 17 minuites of talking he asked that i should have gotten permission before i did this, and i replied i had ( security guards stopped me coming in the society yesterday and after explaining my condition and my intentions they let me on the condition that i only practice where there are few people.) he said those security guards had been fired, and i should have went and asked there. At that point one of the men approached the driver side door ( before they were all talking to me through passenger windows) At that point i realized this may just escalate out of my control, and started the engine, shifted into first and kept the engine idle. \n\nHe then talked to me about what other "wrongdoings" i had done. There was a flat, plain field in the back side of the society and i had used it for random drifting and car control practice. the field was not marked, not well kept, and by all means it looked like nothing more then a empty useless large plot (enough to make a shopping center in.)\nhe then started to complain that i had ruined it and kids played cricket there. i said it looked like a empty field, it had no paving, no evenly and well kept grass growing, it was just a empty plot full of dust.( i admitted to playing around there freely)\nto that he was quiet and asked me the come with him to the admin office. i was/am both a minor and didn''t have any id on me.i declined, and told him that any further questions will be considered harassment. \n\nafter that, he left but had stationed 2 armed guards to keep a eye on me, and i left soon afterwards.\n\nThinking afterwards i could have just ended the encounter sooner, and with less conflict.\nI am soon to get a real gun, and the ranges are too far away and so i want to practice in empty plots, far away from other people. so i ask you, did i behave correctly? if i was shooting a real gun instead, (with a proper backstop) would this have gone the same way? How should i behave if i am in a empty area shooting and am approached by others/authorites?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n@mods= i know i have just posted two threads yesterday, but i would like to inform you i am not spamming. this is the last thread i will be posting in a while.', ''),

With the saiga u have to adjust the valve for different settings. Either for heavy loads or light ones. \n\nBut with the saiga U get a range of tactical options Not least of which are drum mags. Imagine 25 rounds of SG or pure slugs. And since she works as fast as U pull the trigger U can empty the drum in under 6 -7 seconds. \n\nOf course the Saiga''s elder sister the Vepr 12 MOLOT (Hammer) is the greatest shotgun on God''s green earth.. ever made.. With an automatic gas vale U dont even need to switch between light and heavy loads.

I had already made sure nobody was at risk, and everything was safe. ( i also had a large pile of bricks about....8m high to serve as a backstop)\nso i fire away, and had gotten some looks from people behind me, but they peacefully went on their way after a glance.\nabout the point were i had fired off a good 30 rounds (was re-zeroing gun) this...person comes up to me and asks me what i am doing.\ni tell him that i am target shooting/nashanabazi\nhe then tells me i cannot do this here and he is the property owner of the entire society (it happened to be fermanite society on the south side of lahore. anyone who had been there would tell you how undeveloped it is. only the main roads have houses.\n\nThen he proceeds to barrage me with questions from where i was, my fathers name etc etc (he could tell i am a minor). i declined to answer everything except my first name, and the general location of where i lived. He asked further, but i told him that was all he will get. Then he starts talking about what i am doing, how it is bad,and so on in a slightly raised voice. I tell him what i am doing is completely legal, as air rifles dont need licences. nor am i threatening anyone at all. He once again says i cannot do so on this as it is private, but stops the second i tell him that each and every road of pakistan is considered public property, and to stop me is both unlawful and in court he would be thrown out,so i told him go ahead and try,we will see who is right in civil court. ( i was getting kinda nervous as the amount of people had increased from one to about 6, so i bluffed my hand )\n\nso then, seeing as trying to intimidate me wasn''t getting anywhere, he tried to ask my credentials again, and i declined. After another 17 minuites of talking he asked that i should have gotten permission before i did this, and i replied i had ( security guards stopped me coming in the society yesterday and after explaining my condition and my intentions they let me on the condition that i only practice where there are few people.) he said those security guards had been fired, and i should have went and asked there. At that point one of the men approached the driver side door ( before they were all talking to me through passenger windows) At that point i realized this may just escalate out of my control, and started the engine, shifted into first and kept the engine idle. \n\nHe then talked to me about what other "wrongdoings" i had done. There was a flat, plain field in the back side of the society and i had used it for random drifting and car control practice. the field was not marked, not well kept, and by all means it looked like nothing more then a empty useless large plot (enough to make a shopping center in.)\nhe then started to complain that i had ruined it and kids played cricket there. i said it looked like a empty field, it had no paving, no evenly and well kept grass growing, it was just a empty plot full of dust.( i admitted to playing around there freely)\nto that he was quiet and asked me the come with him to the admin office. i was/am both a minor and didn''t have any id on me.i declined, and told him that any further questions will be considered harassment. \n\nafter that, he left but had stationed 2 armed guards to keep a eye on me, and i left soon afterwards.\n\nThinking afterwards i could have just ended the encounter sooner, and with less conflict.\nI am soon to get a real gun, and the ranges are too far away and so i want to practice in empty plots, far away from other people. so i ask you, did i behave correctly? if i was shooting a real gun instead, (with a proper backstop) would this have gone the same way?

The Punjab government has already signed an agreement with Nadra  for the issuance of the cards and computerisation of the record of all  three stages -- [B]weapon manufacturing, selling and repairing.[/B]\n\n[B]The  system is likely to be in place in the next two to three months in the  big cities of Lahore, Rawalpindi, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad and Gujranwala.  The remaining Punjab districts would be covered in a further two  months&#8217; time.[/B]\n\nThe officials frankly admit to Dawn the government  does not have any idea of the extent of illegal weapons in the province  but they say their number could defy highest of projections. The most  disturbing fact, they say, is the presence of countless illegal weapons  licences, manually prepared by the corrupt among staff in the district  governments. The number again is high, showing organised gunrunning. \nThe issuance of illegal licences is a mega fraud committed right under the nose of the DCOs, says a senior government official.\nAs  per the home department record, the number of arms licences in the  province should safely be 1.7 million. If all of them had been renewed  this year at the rate of Rs1,000 per licence, the government should have  collected Rs1.700 billion. But it received just Rs600 million meaning  thereby that only 600,000 licences were renewed. &#8220;The rest of the  licences were made illegally and were therefore not renewed,&#8221; a senior  official inferred.\nAs for the procedure, applications are received  on printed forms which are easily available. Police verification is  attached mentioning particulars of the applicants.\nThe method  adopted by the corrupt is simple: Duplicate books are secretly kept in  which the unauthorised licences are entered. These books are later  destroyed. Corrupt officials can then make licences using fake DCO  stamps. For example, Lahore&#8217;s one-month quota is 250 licences but many  more are issued.\nOnly Lahore district government gets the books  printed from the Security Printing Corporation. In the rest of the  districts these are just another stationery item. An estimated 10  million licences have been issued in Lahore since 1947. The number on  record, officials say, is far less.\nThere are 562 arms dealers in  Punjab though new licences for this business were banned in 1987.  Monitoring them is a big problem as their record is manual which is kept  in ordinary registers. These books can be tampered with or destroyed,  and there is no organised system of ensuring their accuracy.\nFlaws  in the legal method of obtaining bullets for licenced weapons, too,  benefit unscrupulous dealers and the weapon holders. For example, if a  man is allowed 25 bullets in a month, he can buy bullets of the same  number from as much dealers as he likes. And the multiple buying is  seldom traced.\nThere are 12 registered arms manufacturers in  Punjab and there is no system of their products&#8217; forensic audit, making  it impossible to find out the origin of weapons or bullets used in a  crime.\nRepairing arms was once an attached function of the  registered dealers but over the years it has become a separate domain.  There are 700 arms repairers and there is no monitoring of their work  and the suspicion is that their clientele mainly consists of those who  use illegal weapons.\nMore dangerous is the practice of converting  non-prohibitive weapons to the prohibited class. The experts can make a  12-bore cartridge pump-action rifle into a more lethal magazine-loaded  weapon that can fire volleys of bullets.\nOfficials in the home  department say the computerisation and the smart cards would control  such practices to a great extent. Initially, manual licences issued over  the past around five years would be turned into smart cards to be made  by Nadra from the DCOs offices. All particulars of the licence holders  and biometrics of their guns would be verified online through Nadra  record. \nThose whose particulars could not be verified would lose  their licences. All old manually created licences would stand cancelled.  Previously, desirous citizens would routinely buy weapons after getting  manual licences. Now, they would be eligible to get the smart cards  only after buying guns and mentioning their details. \nAll the four  stages of computerisation -- manufacturing, selling, licences for  weapons and repairing -- would be integrated online. Even the biometrics  of each and every bullet which is like fingerprints and the details of  each weapon would be fed online. And the database would be available  with the home department, DCO offices and the law-enforcement agencies. \nOfficials  of LEAs would therefore be able to have verified authenticity of a  licence in no time by merely sending an SMS at a specified number.\n[B]&#8220;Earlier  attempt to computerise record of weapons licences introduced by the  Punjab IT Board in 2009-10 failed. But this Nadra-based system needs to  succeed if anyone is serious in controlling at least official  gunrunning,&#8221; a senior home department official said.[/B]', ''),

If you don''t have enough knowledge or experience, please don''t show yourself an expert or professional one, as your advice or interference cause money loss, bad experience and feeling sad and sorrow on your friend who sought your advice.

Please just an expert or professional persons who are competent with high knowledge guide other less experienced members. Persons that just heard something or has scattered knowledges from here and there, is better to keep silence. Don''t show off please.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nOk lets set the record clear:\r\n\r\nAs the good doctor had stated earlier.  He had purchased a rifle a few days back.  (What he had forgotten to mention. Was that I had accompanied him and we spent the entire day looking at rifles. . And we were joined by other members as well.)\r\nHe has a manual license, issued on 22 april 2014. Yes a “fresh dated manual license” with not one but two weapons on it. Also a practice that is not done. \r\nI also pointed out that it is a 99.99% fake license. \r\nAnd the dealer who makes it is the most unscrupulous dealer in the market. Since ALL licenses are banned these days. \r\nThe license had a provision for pistol and a shotgun.  He asked me if conversion can be done on the shotgun part. I said yes after talking to a number of dealers.\r\nWhat the learned doc did not inform me was that he had a shotgun on “THIS” license. And he wanted a conversion from shotgun to rifle while retaining the shotgun.  In effect 3 weapons on a license that has permission for two!  \r\nThis was an anomaly so obvious that none of the dealers we showed the license to even mentioned it. Since we all assumed that the shotgun section is empty. Since it is pure common sense that one cannot have 3 weapons on a license that has permission for only 2!!! \r\nThere are 4 remedies. \r\n1 Get a fresh rifle license from the same dealer who got him this one. . (Of course it can’t be more fake then the other one)\r\n\r\n2  Sell the shotgun and get a rifle\r\n\r\n3 take back the advance money from the dealer\r\n\r\n4 Or blame me for the terrible injustice I have done him! \r\n\r\nP.S can somebody please explain exactly "what" I gained as he has expressly implied And what has he lost since all he has to do is simply go and take back his Rs. 20,000 advance and he will retain his lovely shotgun. \r\n\r\nBut I guess option 4 suits him best! It been convenient!', ''),

Hey guys, initially I was hoping to get a beretta but due to the ridiculous price bubble on them, and the fact that the CZs feel a lot more better in my hands, I''ve narrowed my search down to the cz75 or the new edition ss.\r\n\r\nSo I''ve held both and just love the grip on the black CZ. However, I love the color on the new edition. My question is, if I get the new edition, can I get the original black grip (instead of the maroon grip it originally comes with)?

(600651, ' I found this while poking through some old forum posts last night.  I remembered the thread here, so here it is.  I''ve posted about other dreams elsewhere, I just have to find them...\r\n\r\nrock videos\r\n\r\nTRX\r\n02-23-2011\r\n\r\nI caught some kind of flu bug; my stomach is upset and I can''t sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. And I''ve been having some really weird dreams.\r\n\r\nOn the rare occasions I remember dreams, they''re long rambling messes that seem to go on for hours and seldom make any sense, like channeling some unknown Quentin Tarantino movie. This last one was extremely vivid and quite short.\r\n\r\nI was working the night shift somewhere. No idea where or what I was doing; the dream started when I was digging my lunch out of the refrigerator in the cafeteria. A couple of people said hello, or welcome back - they were all people I''d worked with before, on different jobs in real life. Apparently we''d all been laid off and recently called back to work.\r\n\r\nSo I''m sitting in the cafeteria eating my sandwich, and there''s a TV tuned to a moldy-oldy rock video channel. Sammy Hagar is doing a song that sounds vaguely like Crosby, Stills, & Nash''s "Southern Cross", except the refrain is "D T M." I kind of liked it.\r\n\r\nSome VJ that looked like Bob Barker came on and blithered something for a minute, and then started playing Elvis Presley''s cover of Cheap Trick''s "Surrender" from his 1979 Comeback Tour. That was weird enough to wake me up; I couldn''t remember when that song came out. 1980? 1981? It bugged me enough I got up, turned on the computer, and looked it up. It was from "Cheap Trick at Budokan" in 1978. Brrr...\r\n\r\n"Mother told me\r\nyes she told me\r\nI''d meet girls like you.\r\nShe also told me\r\n''Stay away\r\nyou never know what you''ll get!''"\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n Bob Barker was a TV game show host in the USA for something like 50 years.  They''d probably call him a "presenter" nowadays.  And Elvis Presley died in 1977.  And Cheap Trick was one of those American bands that never quite made it in their own country, while being immensely popular somewhere else; they were way better than a lot of more-successful bands.', ''),

(607916, ' I had this gun about a year ago. babaz7, brother don''t want to ruin your moment there are some pros and many cons. First of all the function is 100% normal.\r\n\r\nPros: High quality, light weight and thin profile; easy for CC. \r\nWhat u have is: \r\nV1: CDA trigger system (LEM). The LEM trigger is a dual-stage trigger that fires from a hammer down position in both SA and DA modes with decocker, but has an internal mechanism that is cocked with each cycle of the action. It provides a constant trigger pull of 20 N (4.5 lbf) (+4/-2 N).\r\n\r\nCons: High muzzle flip due to light weight, for range the hammer is very distracting when it comes back to fire in SA. The trigger is very unusual. Resale sucks; I hope you didn''t pay too much for it. P30 would''ve been a better option. That''s why I sold it. But very reliable for HD/CC. \r\n\r\n[IMG][URL=http://s1063.photobucket.com/user/gunfreak2/media/Mobile%20Uploads/3255529D-4561-40F1-B9D0-BD25D123EDEC_zpsht9joi0i.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1063.photobucket.com/albums/t511/gunfreak2/Mobile%20Uploads/3255529D-4561-40F1-B9D0-BD25D123EDEC_zpsht9joi0i.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG][URL=http://s1063.photobucket.com/user/gunfreak2/media/Mobile%20Uploads/2CF00F68-2442-4230-828F-B099026E3650_zps73nyjcxf.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1063.photobucket.com/albums/t511/gunfreak2/Mobile%20Uploads/2CF00F68-2442-4230-828F-B099026E3650_zps73nyjcxf.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG][URL=http://s1063.photobucket.com/user/gunfreak2/media/Mobile%20Uploads/E6E9CB89-6C38-495F-8A5D-A2C676101ACC_zpskge3phxz.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1063.photobucket.com/albums/t511/gunfreak2/Mobile%20Uploads/E6E9CB89-6C38-495F-8A5D-A2C676101ACC_zpskge3phxz.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]', ''),

This animal deserve greater respect than the tag of vermin it is labelled. \nAlthough giving a double tap with slug and shot is also true classic for boar. I believe out to 40-50 yards, a double shotgun with slug in right barrel and Eley Alphamax equivalent LG load in left barrel, will give satisfying results. \nBut one shall always  pattern the barrels and since pattern always give up before penetration, the 10"-12" pattern at given range shall be considered max range. \nCount of the dead pigs is not measurable against satisfaction of couple of clean kills. But that is only my view.[/QUOTE]\n\nI agree with you on a few points but lets keep in mind most boar hunts take place to help farmers free there lands from this pest.\nThese farmers have extremelly limited resources and cannot obtain a 7mm magnum or similar rifle which takes a 500 rs round of ammo.\nA wah SG is only for about a 40 rs a shell which is reasonable for an average person.\nSecondly in my experience boars have to be stalked and shot quite often in dense bushes where a shotgun is a safe bet,it may not be the most effective weapon in terms of one shot one kill but its the best weapon in terms of close range hunting.\n\nI appreciate your views.', ''),

Maybe its like knock off motorcycles or generators with Ferrari branding?[/QUOTE]\n\n\nNorinco does not have any factories of its own. Its a brand name. Or an ''export house'' if you will.\n\nInitially they used to export under the Norinco Banner to the states but due to certain reasons they were not able to do so again.  So they switched banners to "Intercon" Here in Pakistan Intercon CF 98 9mm pistols were cheaper then Norinco branded ones. \n\nEven though both were made at the Cheng Feng facility (hence the CF) \n\nOnce they were even exporting the "Shaheen" brand of CF 98 pistols here in Pakistan. Again manufactured at the same Cheng Feng facility.  \n\nWhat you saw in the price list was a "Norinco" branded 1911. Not Norinco manufactured. \n\nPersonally i prefer the Shaheen or the intercon CF 98 (even though they are extremely rare) because they are a lot cheaper. Because people mistakenly assume they are manufactured by Norinco. A Norinco stamped CF used to be a good 5k more expensive then a non norinco stamped one even though they came from the same factory. \n\nThe actual weapons are manufactured all over china and collected and sent overseas by Norinco corporation.', ''),

(607918, ' [QUOTE=Fraz;445733]Ive used the mp5 very frequently and did face a few FTEs, however ammo and the gun''s maintenance is also a factor leading to such issues. The primary reason for it being sacked is the present war scenario in the country. IMHO MP-5 is not meant for armies, it is meant for SWAT forces and police units which have to go in close quarter battles (CQB) i.e in buildings etc. It has a very limited range but is very accurate on short range even on full auto. Easy control, low recoil and small size are its pros, FTEs are cons... Army requires infantry weapons, if you have noticed or spoken to your army buddies you will find out that army during this operation has purchased the type 56-2 by the thousands and it is the most favoured weapon of all soldiers. All combatants prefer taking the AK to the field over the G3 even. New mp5 are still being produced at Wah, they have even introduced a few derivatives of it as well.

(601001, 'Breech Seal for Airking- Made out of Teflon As I mentioned in my previous posts that the breech seal for the compression cylinder of the Airking was damaged due to mis-feed of a pellet and as its alternative I had to use two O-rings as a temporary setup. Khilji brother suggested that if I have to make a breech seal, I should make it out of Teflon. In Peshawar I was unable to find it and requested Khilji to send a Teflon rod from Karachi which he did.

(601029, ' I think you''ll get years of enjoyment out of your new toy!\n\n If you''ve never owned a revolver before, I''d like to point out that grip shapes vary a lot, and what works for some people definitely doesn''t work for others.  Some are designed to let the gun rotate up in your hand on recoil, some are shaped to prevent that; many are too fat at the bottom to get a solid grip, etc.\n\n If you aren''t happy with the feel of the gun or its group size, try changing or modifying the grips.  If you can find a spare set, you can build them up with layers of tape, or carve them down with a knife, until they fit your hand, then cover them with friction tape. \n\n I once traded away a very nice Ruger that I couldn''t hit anything with; when I pulled the trigger, the gun shifted into a different position in my hand every time.  I didn''t realize that the problem was because the grips were too small at the top and too fat at the bottom.\n\n Taurus seems to be aware of this; their rounded molded-plastic grips fit my hand much better than the usual wood grips.', ''),

The distance was 60 meters and it was slightly windy. After zeroing the Airking, this was the group which we got with JSB 15.89 grain pellets. 7 pellets made a 1.25 inch group and there was one flyer; my blunder; I had my left thumb resting on the scope''s rings and it interfered the recoil-less motion of the receiver. \nSo the conclusion is that the breech seal is working perfectly fine and at 60 meters distance, this is a very satisfactory output from a springer. We did try RWS 15.89 grains also and it had a much larger spread (almost 2.5 inch) as compared to the JSBs. I think for distances upto 45 meters, RWS will work but for any further than that, JSB should be the ultimate choice.', ''),

Actually, the Glock 17 I had was a wonderful weapon after having shot about 900 rounds I really loved it. When I first walked in to the gun store, my options were Glock 17 Gen 4 and Glock 19 Gen 3. Being my first Glock, I just wanted to opt for the newest. Since there was no Gen 4 Glock 19, I was left with the G17 and G26. The 26 didn''t suit my needs so 17 was the way to go. While physically comparing I really didn''t see much difference in dimensions of both the Glocks 17 and 19 to the point that the full frame pistol would become a deal-breaker for me. Holding both pistols, the 17 felt as comfy as the Gen 3 Glock. Even tried it on with an IWB holster without issues. So I took the plunge that time. \nLittle did I realize that the G17 was empty (and light). While carrying concealed for short spans didn''t bother a lot, with extended durations it started becoming uncomfortable (heavy). A major issue was that of printing. While everything else could have worked for me, but I simply couldn''t avoid printing. I also wasn''t shooting very accurate with it compared to my previous weapon, a CZ Duty P- 07 which would almost always give me tighter groups. Thus I went back to the drawing board, figured out what was the best option available and got this Glock 19 (Alhamdolillah).', ''),

The distance was 60 meters and it was slightly windy. After zeroing the Airking, this was the group which we got with JSB 15.89 grain pellets. 7 pellets made a 1.25 inch group and there was one flyer; my blunder; I had my left thumb resting on the scope''s rings and it interfered the recoil-less motion of the receiver. \nSo the conclusion is that the breech seal is working perfectly fine and at 60 meters distance, this is a very satisfactory output from a springer. We did try RWS 15.89 grains also and it had a much larger spread (almost 2.5 inch) as compared to the JSBs. I think for distances upto 45 meters, RWS will work but for any further than that, JSB should be the ultimate choice.[/QUOTE]\n\nthanks for coming bro. i really enjoyed your company and the zeroing process. no doubt Airking is the king of air rifles :)', ''),

(601303, 'Practical Rifle Cartridge for Pakistan Hi to All,\nWe all like to keep and shoot different rifles.\nIt maybe a small bore like .22lr, or a deer/ sheep hunter like 7x57, .30/06, many inherit some big bore like .375 or classic double. Few also like military type weapons.  \nBut the fact remains that times are not great for rifle shooters. There are no affordable deer/ sheep for average pakistani rifle hunter. Many buy .22lr for small game and vermin but in my view, it really lacks the range needed for common small game (app 150-200 yards) and definitely the punch for our only common big game, the Wild Boar. In this scenario most rifle hunters have become rifle keepers.\nWhat do you think is the practical rifle cartridge for average pakistani rifle hunter filling following parameters;\n\n      1) Legal and non military.\n      2) Small game capable upto 200 yards. (jackals, porcupine, grey heron and feral dogs etc).\n      3) Wild boar capable.\n      4) Affordable to shoot. (not Rs. 600 a pop).\n\nLooks tough bill to fill.

(601336, ' Thank you everyone.\n\nThe boar in the first picture was shot at 13 yards with a sidewise shot placed between the ear and the eye. It was moving while shot, and dropped instantly, the shot hit the brain thru the ear canal. No flashlight was used, it was a moonlit night. Gun BSA SuperTen .22 AR with 16 grain AirArms Diabolo Field, scope mag 4x. It was huge with reasonable tusks.\n\nSecond picture boar was about 32-38 yards away, facing us directly. Used the Hatsan BT65 Elite .22 AR with H&N Rabbit Magnum II 24.7 grains, scope at 4x magnification. Shot placement between the eyes a few inches high on the forehead. Dropped dead. This one was also a large male boar but had no tusks.\n\nThird one, at around 15 yards. Used Hatsan BT65 Elite with H&N Rabbit Magnum II 24.7 grains, placed  shot 1.5-2 inches above middle of eye line. Knocked out in a shot. Big size male with tiny tusks forming, and a very dense back hairline.\n\nFourth was a fully grown female, there were two smaller ones in front of it. BSA SuperTen with 16 grain Air Arms, scope at 4x mag. A friend took the first shot on a smaller one, downed instantly, second shot on the other small one, down. They were both at 20 yards. The female at 25 yards next shot on the forehead, lights out. All three in rapid succession, 3 shots -> 3 kills in 7-8 seconds.\n\nFinally the last one, it was a huge tusker. Again with BSA S10 and 16g AA, scope 4x mag, no flashlight used. Downed with a head shot, had to be finished off with another point blank brain shot.', ''),

Nikon lenses come in two varieties: the older lenses without inbuilt auto focus motors and the newer better lenses with inbuilt auto focus motors. Older lenses need an in-built motor that the mid-level DSLR''s don''t have. Since older lenses are easily available and are cheaper they have an added charm and this where mid-level DSLR''s are wanting. All high end Nikon DSLR''s have in-built motors and can autofocus older and newer lenses effortlessly.\n\nAll Canon lenses have inbuilt auto focus motors so the question of a camera body having or not having one doesn''t arise ever.\n\nP.S: You can always focus older Nikon lenses manually though.', ''),

It is a popular sport among the south Central Asians such as the Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, Turkmens and Pashtuns.\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/"][IMG]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/7214/96474631.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/"][IMG]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6639/29905679.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nBuzkashi horses require special training in order to be successful in the game. Should the rider be thrown or dismount, the horse waits. A trained horse will gallop with terrific speed as soon as the horseman snatches the carcass of a calf in order to gain an edge in the game. \n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/"][IMG]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6448/85567419.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\nTraditionally, a calf is beheaded, the legs are cut off at the knee and its entrails are removed. The carcass of the calf is then soaked in cold water for 24 hours before the game so that it may be tough enough to withstand the tugging that takes place. When there is no calf available, a goat is used instead.\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/"][IMG]http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/1994/76044375.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nWinners are awarded prizes of "chapan", turbans, cash or rifles.According to unwritten rules of the game, nobody can tie the carcass to his saddle or hit his opponent on the hand to snatch the calf. Likewise, tripping an opponent by using the rope is forbidden.\n\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/"][IMG]http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/1239/49672268.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/"][IMG]http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/7918/98250248.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/"][IMG]http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/7193/10482430.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/"][IMG]http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/3827/29254677.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nA US Soldier in  Buzkushi[/QUOTE]\n\n\nVery Very nice and informative post thanks for sharing this use-full information with us :)', ''),

(601675, ' [QUOTE=SUPREME_HUNTER;422812]salam all my first post in this impressive thread I enjoyed and learned a lot in this particular thread. sharing some info about Chechens using .22lr snipers against Russians.underestimated .22 will be too lethal in skilled hands.The lowly .22 caliber long rifle round is becoming a favorite among snipers. Professional assassins (usually thugs working for organized crime) have long favored using .22 caliber (5.56mm) pistols for their work. While not a powerful round, if you shoot someone up close with a.22 caliber pistol several things are noted.1- The victim is dead if you shoot him in the head, which is what pros usually aim for (as these guys like to say, "two in the head and you know he''s dead.") 2- There is hardly any sound if you use a silencer, and not much even if you don''t. 3-A 22 caliber pistol is small, even with a silencer. That makes it easier to conceal, and easier to dispose of.Then the Russians noted that Chechen snipers were effectively using .22 LR (long rifle, then little bullets kids use to hunt squirrels and rabbits with) weapons. Inside towns and cities, the .22 LR sniper was veryeffective, especially since the Chechens would improvise a very workable silencer by putting a plastic bottle on the end of the rifle''s barrel, with a hole in the bottom of the barrel for the bullet to exit. Using a cheap scope, Chechen snipers were very deadly at ranges of less than a hundred meters. Such ranges were pretty common in built up areas. And since you usually did not hear the shot (to the head or face, of course), you had a hard time finding the shooter. Having suffered from these low tech .22 caliber Chechen snipers for ten years, the Russians have come out with their own professional .22 LR sniper rifle, the SV-99. This is a little heavier (at 8.3 pounds) than your usual .22 LR rifle, but is built for professionals. It has a heavier barrel, a bipod, silencer and scope. It''s 39 inches long and can accept five, eight or ten round magazines. There is a compartment in the butt stock for two five round magazines. With the SV-99, at a hundred meters, a skilled shooter can consistently put all rounds in a half inch circle. This is a specialist weapon, most likely used by commandos. But any trained sniper can quickly adapt to using it. And snipers like not being heard.#mods hopefully you dont dont for some words in this post which are intended solely for informational purpose. cheers[/QUOTE]\n\n\nAoa ,, just to clear for general information,  .22 LR is not 5.56mm.. its 5.5 mm...    5.56mm is .222 and 5.7mm is .223.. they might be different by just a fraction but the end results are very very different..', ''),

(601867, ' My mistake. It shall be correctly called Common House Shrew. \nMole is somewhat larger and maybe a type of rat. \n\nDarts are simple. In my preferred method, basic things required are;\n  1) Scotch tape 1" wide.\n  2) Sharp lead pencil.\n  3) Scissors.\n\nTo make cone, take two pieces of scotch tape about 1-2" long. Take one piece of tape and roll it sticky side out on the cone of lead pencil. You have sticky side out cone. The other piece of tape will be rolled over sticky cone in a manner that its sticky side is inside. So now you have a cone of scotch tape with inner and outer smooth surfaces (both sticky sides against each other). Put the cone in the blowpipe and mark the excess with pencil. Cut the excess and you have a cone. \nTake the nail and cut appropriate hole in the cone. Insert the nail inside and the head of the nail will act as stopper. You will need another stopper on the nail to stop the cone from blowing away over nail as you blow. This stopper can be a simple very thin scotch tape roll over nail just ahead of cone. All done, you are ready to shoot. ( Nails shall be used in over 12mm pipes to get reasonable velocity, mine is 18mm).\nBlowpipe can be any pipe filling these basic parameters;\n1) Rigid and without hang. (Graphite, Aluminium, PVC).\n2) Smooth consistent inner bore above 12mm.\n3) Minimum 3'' long, carefully straight cut and both ends smooth out so it is without burrs.\n\nI have not invented anything, stuff is there on web, I just practiced it out of interest.\nWill try to load pictures of the process and types of darts I use for certain game.', ''),

But it makes more sense to local moviegoers.\n\nThe “05 Chinese Police Revolver” is an unusual weapon, and that’s apparently the point. Government and private experts say Chinese ballistics engineers specifically designed the weapon to minimize risks associated with introducing handguns into a society that has little experience with firearms.\n\nFor the first time in 60 years, the police officers in Shanghai will be armed with handguns according to a report at china.org.cn.  The report states the officers will carry a 9mm revolver that is equipped with three safety devices and can fire rubber bullets in addition to conventional ammunition. \n\nThe revolvers in question are likely the 9mm police revolvers identified here by world.guns.ru.  The handguns are a double action revolver with a swing out cylinder that are chambered for a low power 9mm round.  According to the information, the rounds are ballistically similar to the .38 S&W (not Special).  Muzzle velocity is listed as 720 fps with an unknown weight bullet.\n\n\nNote: Last 4 paragraphs are taken from net. \n\n\nSeniors Comment and share your knowledge and if there is anyway we mango people can get this revolver plz Help.', ''),

For e.g. My Hatsan Mod99 is an amazing airgun, the trigger is really nice and the finish is outstanding but weighing at 3.8kgs, it is slightly on the heavier side.\n\nHatsan 125th is an amazingly powerful airgun but has much twang and felt recoil in it.\n\nLikewise Gamo Shadow is an amazing airgun for the price, its just that the trigger is really annoying and also I felt that the Shadow looks like glass made as compared to the Hatsan.

Few also like military type weapons.  \nBut the fact remains that times are not great for rifle shooters. There are no affordable deer/ sheep for average pakistani rifle hunter. Many buy .22lr for small game and vermin but in my view, it really lacks the range needed for common small game (app 150-200 yards) and definitely the punch for our only common big game, the Wild Boar. In this scenario most rifle hunters have become rifle keepers.\nWhat do you think is the practical rifle cartridge for average pakistani rifle hunter filling following parameters;\n\n      1) Legal and non military.\n      2) Small game capable upto 200 yards. (jackals, porcupine, grey heron and feral dogs etc).\n      3) Wild boar capable.\n      4) Affordable to shoot. (not Rs. 600 a pop).\n\nLooks tough bill to fill.

(602341, ' Mr. Legion\r\n\r\nThank you for your prayers and  positive feedback.  We are grateful to you. \r\n\r\nSir to briefly answer some of your points.\r\n\r\nWe do keep engaged with professionals and other manufacturers like ourselves during world famous defense, hunting, sporting and outdoor shows such as Shot show USA,  IWA show Germany, Ideas Expo Pakistan, IDEX Abu Dhabhi.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we have consultants from North America and South Africa who guide us on development and R&D projects. We are a professional company and have been doing a lot of good work on an international level specially in the defense and aerospace fields. We are not your average industrial estate gun maker without scientific knowledge of materials and engineering processes!\r\n\r\nWe are honoured to hear that there is hope and anticipation by Pakgun members that the Trushot is not far from other high end handguns. I.A. it will prove itsself as more enthusiasts like yourself start using it very soon. Our Scratchless coatings are one of akind and a true innovation on part of DSA which is rare on any other handguns in the market. If this were on a foreign branded weapon people would probably pay 50k to 100k more. While you still question a firing pin broken (already clarified by pg members as a non significant issue and already rectified by DSA) after much abuse for an awesome handgun we are offering for an extremely reasonable and affordable price. We invite you to weigh the options and come try it out for yourself. You wont be disheartened I.A.\r\n\r\nAs for grades, our standard base model will qualify with all minimum firearm safety and performance requirements. There is no question about that and we can be certain as we are using the specified materials. In the future we may introduce models that are "match grade"  but this will be in the future.\r\n\r\nThank you, please do share and like and spread our posts on facebook, every bit helps and it all works towards making this Pakistani made product get the deserved exposure for which we have worked very hard. We hope that the Trushot will be a game changer in this industry and change the way people perceive "Made in Pakistan" forever.\r\n\r\nWe are also very excited about the DSA 9 and  1911 projects going on which are to progress very steadily throughout 2014. I.A. updates on those as soon as they become available. For now lets get some Trushots in action.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nDSA\r\n \r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Legion-Lad;440192]Warm welcome sir..i also appreciate your enthusiasm and positivity for the local Arms support,& Sir g you can call me Student:yo: as you are the Sir :).\r\nI would like to suggest DSA some things,that should be\r\n(1) That DSA do look dedicated in furnishing the new 9mm BUT DSA definitely need some REAL experts, by that I mean they should arrange some workshop(sort of) and call some experts from a well known organization in Arms development like Glock,this will help DSA to produce more quality guns, they must strictly behave professional.\r\n(2) and the Grade thing discussed earlier, I think they can use it in a +ve way, they can name it Customization,for instance a Customer can select a barrel with the life of 5,000 or 1,000 rounds,or a customer can have fiber optic sights, or an ambidextrous Trushot, or a 9+1 mag instead of 14+1,or an extended mag, so this means CAPACITY difference not grade, a 5,000,9+1 capacity,non-ambidextrous one is less capable,and the other is bit more, this way you can keep the price lower & higher,this will take DSA to some other level,\r\n(3)& last thing is that plzz be in touch with customers through Social media,e-mail......it really makes a customer happy.\r\n\r\n And of-course our Arms forces can also use yours handguns when a more stable & Military standard model comes in, after all you guys have invested a fair amount of money & I pray for DSA to be able (within an some period) to compare there arms with the top of the line products.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Both have had some awesome reviews. Now if i were to choose one, I would like the senior members to help me sort this out, as to which is better and why. And if there is any other better alternative feedback would be much appreciated. I believe there are many people like myself who don''t want to get a Chinese airgun as their first or second firearm but would like something more durable between this mid-range--15k-20k.', ''),

If a clone could surpass technologically in almost all aspects from its model, the manufacturing company would ensure it doesn''t step into the category of being essentially labeled as a clone.

It''s good to know that you are actually trying to take your first step in the right direction but too many of us and too much of Google May lay you off in the end or compel you to do the forbidden.\n\n[COLOR=#008000][B]So if I have it correct, your checklist (as per you) looks something like this:[/B]\n[/COLOR]1.  Handgun Caliber Selected: 9mm[COLOR=#008000][/COLOR][COLOR=#008000][/COLOR]\n2.  Reason to Purchase: Self Defence (SD)\n3.  Budget: Pretty Good Budget (A Word of Advice: Don''t tell it to the dealer)\n4.  Research: Online / Internet / Google and what not\n5.  Top Ranking for SD: CZ-75 (Please check, re-check and re-check)\n\n[B][COLOR=#0000ff]Now here are some of my questions that you need to clarify for my own checklist:[/COLOR][/B]\n1.  Size Category? (Full size, Compact, Sub Compact) Since it''s going to be for SD so CCW\n2.  Your Hand Size? (Will determine and affect the factor mentioned above)\n3.  License Acquisition? You have no idea. How can you CC if you ain''t got a valid license?\n\n[B][COLOR=#ff0000]Okay, now these are my observations and comments regarding your purchase:[/COLOR][/B]\n1.  You want the best of the best since money is no problem. The highest rated handgun or brand name may not necessarily work for you in this case.\n2.  Starting from the budget CF-98 to Glocks, Sigs and H&K are all dependable. You need to have a way with your firearm to be able to depend upon it in times of need. Claiming to have the latest and the greatest on you is not enough until you have come to terms with each other.\n3.  Yes, brand names do count due to their proven track records, Research and Development (R&D), quality control, customer support, easy access and availability of spares and accessories etc etc. But consider those whose accessories and specially spares are easy to access.\n4.  I sincerely hope and wish that you are able to continuously fire 1000 rounds every day of your life that too without heating up, happily ever after. We all know that is not the case. Every weapon (and I said every weapon) heats up. Some faster than the others. But that involves numerous factors such as type/ quality of ammo, operating temperatures/climate, level of maintenance on the gun and material/metallurgy of the weapon platform to name a few.\n5. In even the worst of gun fights you will never come across a situation where you may be required to even fire 200 rounds from your handgun (we''ll talk about movie flicks later). Please let me remind you, any weapon platform is going to heat up when fired, especially continuously.\n6.  You want it all, out of this world accuracy, speed, handling, materials and looks (Don''t worry it''s natural). But as per my meagre knowledge and experience, you end up cutting corner(s) regardless of your pick. And I''ll call those corners "Personal Preferences". This is what all this gun world is about. This is why we are here in the first place. This is how gun makers and dealers are doing business.\n7.  While I need to save up something for my 800th post, I''ll just advise you to go along with an experienced Pak Gunner with valid Arms License for some shopping and I''m sure you won''t go wrong.', ''),

You have correctly arrived at the point that you need a large frame handgun due to your big hands. So let''s cut down to the chase. I''m all for CZ P-01 but definitely do consider H&K USP, Sig P226, Glock 17 and even CZ P-09. Today''s handguns are generally speaking, all reliable. Just be sure to use decent ammo.

Like the chinese Ak''s are heavier then Russians, bulgarians etc, this is heavier than the American ar15''s. I compared the weight with a S&W M&P AR15 and it feels slightly heavier. Again, nothing that makes a difference.\n\nIt will take almost all ar15 accessories made, Might need a few adjustments for the rails or the handguard but with some magpul furniture, it no less then a 10 lac AR.\n\n[B]Performance:\n[/B]First time it went to the range, it indeed impressed the crowd and i myself was amused with the performance. The rate of fire is as fast as your finger. Trigger is good, not too much travel but will get a polish later.\nShot 200 chinese rounds. Got an Ftf in the 2nd mag. Cleared it quickly and it went on smooth from there. Later found a loose primer in the chamber so it was an ammo related issue.\n\nI will not post or discuss accuracy as this is not a match grade rifle. Its an assault rifle. But i can shoot a moving pepsi can at 50 meters and not miss once. But that was the aimpoint, not me.\n The ambidextrous safety and mag release is another plus. \n\n[/FONT][/COLOR][URL="http://s1271.photobucket.com/user/Mubashir123/media/807DD0C6-944A-42D9-A90B-324AED2AE3EB-580-00000096BDC212EE_zps5370a172.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/807DD0C6-944A-42D9-A90B-324AED2AE3EB-580-00000096BDC212EE_zps5370a172.jpg[/IMG][/URL][COLOR=#444444][FONT=Calibri]\n\nPlease DONT put holes in this to make it auto or any other mod for that matter.

While I still stand by my earlier post #96, I do believe that Verve has got a point here. Clones from Canik and Norinco cannot be compared since I consider (and many of us will agree) that the former is Grade A. Fit/Finish and price tags may not always be the deciding factors for labelling one gun superior to the rest otherwise Taurus line of pistols are much prettier, inside out. Let''s face it, today, Taurus has established itself in the case of PT92/99 and PT1911. While they are essentially clones, probably none of us refer to them as such. Everywhere these two are known for "Best Value, High Value, Best Bang for the Buck" etc. still they will never be, understandably, called Grade A in their respective categories of Beretta 92 and the classic 1911. And I''m sure some of us PT92 and PT1911 owners must have put lots of rounds through their pipes. \nCanik55 pistols (except for one odd model) are good pistols. I''ll definitely buy one if I ever feel the need and could afford another piece. These are robust and elegantly cloned firearms of their respective mother platforms. Canik has been very well received in the US market primarily because of good marketing backed by good quality.', ''),

It was really worth waiting an awesome pistol .[/QUOTE]\nVery much obliged for your well wishes, gentlemen. \n\nNow coming to the range report. Yesterday, Aquarius sir and myself found a brief chance to try out 97B at his village. Well, you cant ask for more if you go to a make-shift shooting range and there it turns out to be a wedding in the neighborhood. Yes, yes, as we reached there, the news awaited us that the Walima ceremony of a certain acquaintance of Aquarius sir was in progress. I personally being very fond of "Daig walay chawal" couldn''t resist the temptation and accompanied Aquarius sir on this sacrilegious attack on rice pots. lol\n\nAfter a delicious lunch, the next thing on the agenda was test firing CZ 97B and what a delight it turned out to be. Half size bricks (4x4 inches) from a nearby under-construction house were used as targets and at 25+ meters, the CZ was eating the bricks with every third shot. It was my first time with a .45 and I was not completely used to the alignment of the sights of the handgun so I guess there is space for improvement in due time, InshAllah. \n\nAs mentioned in almost every review which I read about it, the trigger of CZ 97B was slightly rather very minutely stiff and according to Aquarius sir, a dramatic change will be felt in it once at least 250 rounds have passed through its pipe. We shot about 40 odd rounds and no issue whatsoever was faced with it. \n \nNow coming to the next delightful handgun at our test range; Sarsilmaz K2-45, a league of its own. I have to say that the trigger on this 14 rounder is no less than a Match Trigger you would find on those high end Czechmates and Sigs. Ufff, it was so soft and responsive that I felt like as if I am shooting a well calibrated T06 Trigger on a 54 Airking…..

While I do not consider myself a marksman but I managed to hit the cans each time to my joy. The sight of the cans getting tossed up in the air was an exhilarating experience, atleast for me. I could practically not judge any delay between the gun firing and the impact sound on the cans explaining the sheer velocity the Hatsan 125 produces on its projectiles.\n\nMy point...we need to learn to enjoy using our guns and once we have done that, the experience is very rewarding and the 125 sniper makes this job very easy for a novice like me.\n\nHats off to Hatsan !', ''),
(602870, ' Respected Gentlemen,\n\nApologies on our part if anyone is offended by the previous comment for that was not the intention. The intention was to make a clear distinction between what level of detail we feel comfortable in sharing publicly.\n\nWe are sure had you have asked your original question in person or over the telephone with the senior management of DSA they would have responded to your query adequately. We apologize but we will not be sharing engineering specs. beyond typical details that are usually found on Product spec. sheets or Product brochures.\n\nFor those who still think we are comparing our product to Glock, couldn''t be further from reality \nAs we have clearly mentioned in previous posts that our goal is to introduce the Trushot as its own category of product and not a replacement for CZs  or Glocks or other big brands. The TRUSHOT is a reliable and affordable handgun designed with the Pakistani shooter in mind by a Pakistani company that values its culture, traditions and professional ethics. As a matter of fact PG members brought in brand names to the discussions themselves. We have been open to constructive criticism and such drastic comparisons as it is not uncommon to benchmark products within the same category in an industry. After all it is a major part of product development, realisation and market acceptance in any professional and commercial industry. \n\nThe mention of the Glock and their firing pin "issue" article (which pg members still wish to give the silent treatment) in the previous post was merely to highlight the fact that, yes mishaps do happen but companies do not go about giving out their material specs for every tiny component. Indeed, If the part fails, there is certainly a warranty and beyond that a parts availability guarantee and a moral obligation for the company to ensure such an issue is resolved for its customers, all of which we will honour at any time. The standard Spec. Sheet has been formulated for sharing publicly as and when requested by individuals or organizations. As per your requests I.A. we will also post it here in due time. \n\nAs mentioned in earlier posts, the firing pin design was revised, tested and implemented immediately after the issue was witnessed. Alhumdolillah we feel that the same issue should not arise, having said that,  no man made thing is "perfect", although we strive to make our products as safe, reliable and durable as possible within our capabilities.  \n\nOnce again humble apologies if any ones'' feelings got hurt, certainly not the intention. \n\n@Mr. Fraz\nAlso an honour to know about personal DSA products that you own. It is an honour and privilege to have customers like yourself amongst many others. Your name certainly was amongst the gentlemen present on the big shoot out day and your shooting was also impressive Sir. Although Mr. Jibz had certainly some scores to show off that very day. Thank you and we certainly hope to receive you at DSA again soon. \n\n@ Mr.HMD, Mr.COLT1911, Mr.K203, Nazim sb, Mr. JIBZ and other members thank you for your comments and inputs, well noted.\n\nSincerely, \n\nDSA\n\n[QUOTE=hmd;440699]All fire arms manufacture had little hiccups in the beginning H&K , Sigs ,  Beretta S&W etc hell even Glock had issues with their Gen4 but they all went back to the drawing board and fix it with the help from their customer feed backs and review .[/QUOTE]', ''),

(602975, ' [QUOTE=DAUDSONSARMOURY;440740]Respected Gentlemen,\n\nApologies on our part if anyone is offended by the previous comment for that was not the intention. The intention was to make a clear distinction between what level of detail we feel comfortable in sharing publicly.\n\nWe are sure had you have asked your original question in person or over the telephone with the senior management of DSA they would have responded to your query adequately. We apologize but we will not be sharing engineering specs. beyond typical details that are usually found on Product spec. sheets or Product brochures.\n\nFor those who still think we are comparing our product to Glock, couldn''t be further from reality \nAs we have clearly mentioned in previous posts that our goal is to introduce the Trushot as its own category of product and not a replacement for CZs  or Glocks or other big brands. The TRUSHOT is a reliable and affordable handgun designed with the Pakistani shooter in mind by a Pakistani company that values its culture, traditions and professional ethics. As a matter of fact PG members brought in brand names to the discussions themselves. We have been open to constructive criticism and such drastic comparisons as it is not uncommon to benchmark products within the same category in an industry. After all it is a major part of product development, realisation and market acceptance in any professional and commercial industry. \n\nThe mention of the Glock and their firing pin "issue" article (which pg members still wish to give the silent treatment) in the previous post was merely to highlight the fact that, yes mishaps do happen but companies do not go about giving out their material specs for every tiny component. Indeed, If the part fails, there is certainly a warranty and beyond that a parts availability guarantee and a moral obligation for the company to ensure such an issue is resolved for its customers, all of which we will honour at any time. The standard Spec. Sheet has been formulated for sharing publicly as and when requested by individuals or organizations. As per your requests I.A. we will also post it here in due time. \n\nAs mentioned in earlier posts, the firing pin design was revised, tested and implemented immediately after the issue was witnessed. Alhumdolillah we feel that the same issue should not arise, having said that,  no man made thing is "perfect", although we strive to make our products as safe, reliable and durable as possible within our capabilities.  \n\nOnce again humble apologies if any ones'' feelings got hurt, certainly not the intention. \n\n@Mr. Fraz\nAlso an honour to know about personal DSA products that you own. It is an honour and privilege to have customers like yourself amongst many others. Your name certainly was amongst the gentlemen present on the big shoot out day and your shooting was also impressive Sir. Although Mr. Jibz had certainly some scores to show off that very day. Thank you and we certainly hope to receive you at DSA again soon. \n\n@ Mr.HMD, Mr.COLT1911, Mr.K203, Nazim sb, Mr. JIBZ and other members thank you for your comments and inputs, well noted.\n\nSincerely, \n\nDSA[/QUOTE]\n\nFor me its water under the bridge, il soon visit IA and will ask the questions in person.

He did not take any piece of it and said to his companions (suhaba A.S.) that they can eat it.\n\nOne of my scholar friends told me that it is found in the narrations of the companions of Prophet Mohammad S.A.W. that they ate snake (not sure about it if he said these exact words, or was it something like that). Narrations also say that they ate a "wild donkey" (himar''un wah''shiun) which I would conjecture to be a zebra or other equine genus.\n\nI have myself read a whole long hadith in which there is a mention that the companions of Prophet Mohammad S.A.W. ate a giant "ambar fish" (which I think would be a species of the whale, by the descriptions of its size) which was found dead on the shore of a sea. It is worthy to note that the companions of the Prophet S.A.W. were on a recon mission in enemy territory and very wanting of food. However, they brought back some of its meat and the Prophet S.A.W. himself took a piece of it.\n\nWhile I am not a scholar of Islam, my THINKING on the subject (not a fatwa or whatever) is that other than the animals/things which are clearly mentioned as haram in the Holy Quran (which include the dead, the blood and the pork/swine/boar), only those things are haram which are meat eaters or carrion (dead bodies) eaters.

(603309, ' @Engimatic\nYou say huh, but the recoil in a powerful spring rifle is delivered much differently then a rifle.\nRifles have one way recoil, delivered only toward the user. \nin airguns ( springers only) The piston smacks into the front of the rifle, jerking the rifle forward and the pellet leaves the barrel right after, while the forward recoil is still moving the rifle. This results in a unusual vibration and the rifle behaving erratically. the combined vibration and the jerking of the rifle quickly damages scopes. The amount of this is directionally proportional to the FPE of the gun, as all the power of the gun is both used in displacing air and jerking the rifle.\nCompare that to a ordinary rifle where recoil is one way, there is no internal piston slamming, so even if the recoil is more it is delivered slowly rather then all at once.\nA quick google search will confirm this.', ''),

But The shadow is VERY picky about how you hold it, if you dont practice the artillary hold bad accuracy is a given. Hatsan is more powerful, the gamo packs a 12-14 fpe punch (which is quite ample, if handled properly you can take rabbits at 15-20m ranges.) The trigger leaves much to be desired. Both guns are rather heavy, to pull off 40m soda cans i do need to rest my arm. But overall the gamo is somewhat more refined then the Hatsan. Pick either one, both are very capable weapons, just practice the artillary hold and join a gym ( you will be needing it, airguns must be kept still for longer periods of time due to their design, espcially piston ones.)In scopes go pick up a 5k bushnell 3-9x32 scope.

(603445, 'Finally Got The Budget. What To Go For? So. Maybe some of you remember I have been asking a lot about handguns and air rifles (specially PCP ones) in the past few months. I actually wanted to decide which one I should get. Then I didn''t have the budget for either, as I am (fortunately or un) a feudal by profession and get money only at crop harvest.\n\nNow the wheat harvest is over and I have cheated on my clothes, shoes, perfumes etc budget and sneakily saved 50k for my first gun (considering blowguns don''t count). It was a hard cut to make, and I hope Sand never learns about it. If he does, he will kill me. But I hope he will never learn. Still if he does ...\n\nAnyhow. Here I am, with 50k in my pocket. All to spend on an airgun (rather air-RIFLE as the enthusiasts call them). I would prefer it to be a PCP, although if I cannot acquire one in this budget, I might cut out my TT budget and make this one 70k (I was saving 20k for a chinese TT, you jerks! :()\n\nWhat options do I have in 50k budget? I would prefer a PCP (aka, pump in and shoot at semi-auto), a barrel size of .25 AND an integrated silencer/suppressor. As stated above, I can (very very unwillingly) add another 20k to it if I get a really good deal in 70k, but I would prefer to keep it to 50.\n\nThe package should include the gun, the scope and the charging pump (if it has to be bought separately, that is). My geographical location only enables me to visit the Lahore market, so unfortunately the KPK region would be off my range where I gather the gun prices are the lowest.\n\nI am waiting for the experts (specially Khilji and jog3ee) to give a list of options for both, the 50K budget and the 70K budget. Please remember that while I would definitely prefer a PCP, it is not the world''s end for me. I would settle down for a charge-and-shoot-once type spring rifles too, if they are worth the money. The silencer/suppressor has to be integrated to the barrel and the barrel size has to be .25 PCP or non-pcp can be negotiated in the light of FPS, price, accuracy and the weight. I would prefer a lightweight gun with plastic/fiber stock over a heavy "walnut-stock" thing.\n\nI think I have stated everything very clearly.

In my preferred method, basic things required are;\n  1) Scotch tape 1" wide.\n  2) Sharp lead pencil.\n  3) Scissors.\n\nTo make cone, take two pieces of scotch tape about 1-2" long. Take one piece of tape and roll it sticky side out on the cone of lead pencil. You have sticky side out cone. The other piece of tape will be rolled over sticky cone in a manner that its sticky side is inside. So now you have a cone of scotch tape with inner and outer smooth surfaces (both sticky sides against each other). Put the cone in the blowpipe and mark the excess with pencil. Cut the excess and you have a cone. \nTake the nail and cut appropriate hole in the cone. Insert the nail inside and the head of the nail will act as stopper. You will need another stopper on the nail to stop the cone from blowing away over nail as you blow. This stopper can be a simple very thin scotch tape roll over nail just ahead of cone.

You dont need to know these things, to get started you know all there is needed.PCPs are also a bit more delicate then springers, take care of them and especially the gas seals.Most PCPs are extremely accurate, a comparatively cheap (for a PCP) Hatsan Bt65 can pull off  1< inch groups at 75-100 M\ngiven the right shooter and pellets. You wont be getting a semi auto for that measly amount of money, semis cost about 1100 dollars minimum, translating to a final price just for you(without scope pump etc etc) of about 140k just for the rifle.Compared to pistons, PCPs are Nukes. No deficiency in the power dpt whatsoever. They tend to be about double the power of "powerful" piston rifles.\n\nmore about power, fps is a very very misleading term. you should be looking for FPE ratings instead to understand the power output. For reference, my Gamo shadow 1000 outputs about 12FPE and can (and has) taken crows out to 40M (i advise you not to do these long shots with a weak piston rifle, it just ends up in dirty kills)  To put that in perspective a average pcp has about 30+FPE of energy.\n\nIf i were you, i would run as fast as possible to pick up a Hatsan BT65 or BT 45 PCP in polymer tactical stocks, and with side bolts/levers(makes for easier action cycling but if your left handed try the rear and side bolt then get whatever suits you the best). The tactical stocks allow you to hold 2 10-shot mags in it for ease. (rifle comes with 3) It is very accurate and outputs 45FPE (the BT 65, the 45 outputs somewhat less) of energy, so it can make a clean kill at 100m ( if you shot that crow etc at 80m with a piston rifle, i suggest you go and measure out the distance. For piston rifles, (if you used one that is) that figure seems heavily exaggerated. Also with land animals, if you cannot impact its brain accurately, DO NOT SHOOT IT. It will result in a dirty and painful kill and most probably just hurt and maim it. avians are weaker so you can get away with it but for game like rabbits and foxes(yes with a BT65 if you can make the shot ~ 30-40M you can take a fox with a headshot) It also comes with scope, bipod,sling and flashlight, all for about 50-60k i think. the rest of your budget can be spend on the pump.\n\nHeed Deathrows words about the weight of the airgun, a Bt65 weighs 4kg stock and 5kg with a scope.\nAlso as with all powerful pcps, it is LOUD. A suppressor can be obtained for it too for about 40 USD.', ''),

You dont need to know these things, to get started you know all there is needed.PCPs are also a bit more delicate then springers, take care of them and especially the gas seals.Most PCPs are extremely accurate, a comparatively cheap (for a PCP) Hatsan Bt65 can pull off  1< inch groups at 75-100 M\ngiven the right shooter and pellets. You wont be getting a semi auto for that measly amount of money, semis cost about 1100 dollars minimum, translating to a final price just for you(without scope pump etc etc) of about 140k just for the rifle.Compared to pistons, PCPs are Nukes. No deficiency in the power dpt whatsoever. They tend to be about double the power of "powerful" piston rifles.\n\nmore about power, fps is a very very misleading term. you should be looking for FPE ratings instead to understand the power output. For reference, my Gamo shadow 1000 outputs about 12FPE and can (and has) taken crows out to 40M (i advise you not to do these long shots with a weak piston rifle, it just ends up in dirty kills)  To put that in perspective a average pcp has about 30+FPE of energy.\n\nIf i were you, i would run as fast as possible to pick up a Hatsan BT65 or BT 45 PCP in polymer tactical stocks, and with side bolts/levers(makes for easier action cycling but if your left handed try the rear and side bolt then get whatever suits you the best). The tactical stocks allow you to hold 2 10-shot mags in it for ease. (rifle comes with 3) It is very accurate and outputs 45FPE (the BT 65, the 45 outputs somewhat less) of energy, so it can make a clean kill at 100m ( if you shot that crow etc at 80m with a piston rifle, i suggest you go and measure out the distance. For piston rifles, (if you used one that is) that figure seems heavily exaggerated. Also with land animals, if you cannot impact its brain accurately, DO NOT SHOOT IT. It will result in a dirty and painful kill and most probably just hurt and maim it. avians are weaker so you can get away with it but for game like rabbits and foxes(yes with a BT65 if you can make the shot ~ 30-40M you can take a fox with a headshot) It also comes with scope, bipod,sling and flashlight, all for about 50-60k i think. the rest of your budget can be spend on the pump.\n\nHeed Deathrows words about the weight of the airgun, a Bt65 weighs 4kg stock and 5kg with a scope.\nAlso as with all powerful pcps, it is LOUD. A suppressor can be obtained for it too for about 40 USD.[/QUOTE]\n\nI have seen the B65. Thats one HEAVY mother! Spacialy with the heavy scope.. Hell.. I tried aiming it and realised that there is a reason they have provided the bi-pod...

Ive run into trouble with airguns, but to hunt with a .22lr you will need to head out into the wilderness. Also be careful of your backstop. The average .22 rifle does put out accuracy at 100M inferior to a PCP, but it has a bit more hitting power,quite a bit more. If i were you...id go for the Pcp. Guns have ridiculous amounts of paperwork and running costs, its i think..23 or so rs for a .22 lr round, while pellets are for about 1.7 rs each. Note that you wont be able to fire it in your backyard(the .22) and you will get the occasional moron after you. If its with a airgun at least you have more leniency in the law. Taking it places is easier, as it does not need to be licensed at all. Its much easier getting past security when you tell them "its just a airgun" and more often then not they start with a few trivial questions and favour you over others. If you can put up with the hassles, by all means go for the .22 . otherwise the PCP is the most practical bet. Its cheaper to run, more reliable, more accurate, can still take any and all game you would be taking with a .22 does not require a licence and with a suppressor (yes its allowed for airguns, not for real guns) Its far quieter and hence more useful as a hunting tool\n\nIf you decide to go the springer route as Deathrow is suggesting, note that your effective range is no more then 30-40m and since its a springer, it will take you a massive amount of time to get proficient with it, as per the nature of the weapon and its recoil.', ''),

(603643, ' You will have to make it a bit of a squeeze, and might even have to up it a little bit to get the Pcp.\n\nSurg.Ray is correct that 5kg for a gun is downright heavy.A Knights armament SR 25 is the same weight(coincidentally my favourite gun) But you fail to recognise he is comparing it to a piston rifle, one that cannot be used with any sort of support whatsoever aside from the hand(Artillary hold users will know this) if you want accuracy.A Pcp is not so picky. use it with a bipod (it comes with one) jam it against a tree and shoot, use a sling(it also comes with a sling(you will never have to shoot without support)) all will have nada effect on accuracy. Try that with a piston and you will manage to hit the ground,(if your lucky). So it all evens out. Pcp has higher carrying weight and can be used with support, whereas the piston is inverse. My shadow is a measly 2-3kg and i had to work out a bit to get it to stay still in my hand for more then 10 seconds. Now after a year of owning it i would KILL to have the ability to use a rest while shooting.(and ive also sworn myself off any and all piston airguns.)\n\nIMHO 5-6 kg can be carried easily, but it cannot be held easily.\n Long range hunting can be done with ease, as the Bt65 both has the power to do so easily, and comes with a optima 4-12x(something something) scope bundled in. Not by any means world class, but if i can do 40M with a cheapo chinese 4x32 and no support you should be able to leave me behind in the dust with a mid level branded pair of optics and a rest, along with massive power to back it up.\n\nThe reason why the bt65 is so heavy/and somewhat expensive is because its a almost complete hunting package. It has a  large air tank, 70 shots approx, can store clips in the stock, comes with its own optics and has amazing power. If you want to go a bit cheaper(actually the cheapest pcp there is) there is a benjamin discovery in .22, for about 55-60k with pump. it has only a 30 shot capacity( air reservoir not mag size), no optics and no accessories and cannot hold clips in it, and is lighter.\n\nBut if i were you, i would go off and buy a bt65 immediately (its really aggravating having to cut down on shooting due to bullet prices.) A 250 box of gamo promags go for roughly...700-800 rs a tin. a 500 round brick of .22 on the other hand ( 20x500=10k) \nThe only thing pulling you to the .22 is the allure of a real weapon and the excess power. In real quantitative terms the pcp is cheaper (i think brnos go for about 60-70k nowadays, add licence cost of 15-20k on top of that,and 5k more to increase your bullet limit, and even more money for the outragous prices of ammo, and you end up at 100k +) the pcp will cost you no more then 70-80k complete, is more accurate, can take the same game that you will with your .22 (the pcp can take fox sized game,thats about the max you will be going with the .22lr too so no differance) , is quieter, easier to handle in case you get in trouble, (cannot be charged for armed trespassing or something) has no licencing fees, has cheaper ammunition, does not completely destroy whatever animal you are hunting so more meat (.22 does not destroy it either but it does do a good deal of damage to the meat;don''t expect lean fancy gourmet style meat cuts) It also can be taken anywhere you want, even if martial law is declared you can still use it as it isn''t a firearm(no random army or police visits to your home) and it is easier to take to foreign countries or something if you wish to do so. Its magazines are cheaper and they have a larger capacity ( 10 shots vs 5 ). It can still produce a nice bang if you want the feel of a real weapon, and it has no recoil to speak of, so kids can shoot it (with supervision(admittedly they can do .22lr too but no recoil will keep em from being scared) There is also no need of hearing protection ( You will need it for any type of gunpowder weapon, irrespective of the caliber).\nBefore anybody says hearing protection is not needed for a .22lr, let me tell you that anything above 85-90Db causes hearing loss.A .22 going off is about 130 decibels,not enough for instant damage but there will be loss over time and under continued exposure (50-70 rounds, your ears will be ringing. )\n\nIf you want the .22Lr, go for it. A personal desire or lust for a item overrides all logic. A Honda may(and damn well are)be better then a toyota, but if a person LIKES the toyota/xxx brand he will purchase that. If you want the best for you , buy the Pcp.The heart wantswhat the heart wants (assuming you have a deep down soft spot for the .22) you will not be happy with the Pcp even if its better. \n\nBottom line is, that people here have laid bare the facts about your choice.

(603667, ' lol. AP would explode the moment you shoot, even if it were applied at the tip of the bullet. The shock alone would trigger it.\n\nMercury has a very heavy nucleus and it is a transition metal, translating to chemical bonds which are not very stable (unless bonded with extremely electronegative ions such as ... possibly flouride). Which means you cannot (in the absence of very regulated conditions) prepare an impact exploding bullet with most (if not all) mercury compounds.\n\nYes, the bullet caliber would have to be large. Plus the explosive would have to be packed in a casing which absorbs all shock waves coming from the rear side of the casing (you only want it to explode after the shock is generated at the front side, that is, when the bullet hits its target). Another thing which would help, would be to keep the bullet traveling at moderately low fps (so as to limit the chances of an accidental explosion due to shock generated at the rear side).\n\nI would have to admit one mistake in my former post btw. I was mentioning exploding arrows, not exploding bullets. My bad I got hyped and used the word bullet. Yes, preparing exploding bullets is an extremely hard and risky thing and you cannot improvise any at home. Exploding arrows, yes you easily can.

It may make a noticeable improvement for someone who dosent have the arm strength needed yet.  and if you use it incorrectly it will ruin your aim instead of improving it.

Funny thing is, several different types of ammo can and do live up to the FBI standards. That, of course, leaves room for argument.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=proxima-nova]The laws of physics cannot be broken. Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction.

I fired around 40 odd shots with it, and NOT in a consecutive run, but on three different occasions. And then it got stuck. The bullet fired, but the shell did not eject. No matter how much I tried, I couldn''t get it out. So I took it to the workshop under Baksh Elahi in Lahore. They kept trying to move the barrel by hitting it with wood, but the wood would break, and yet the barrel wouldn''t move. Finally, on the third day, they asked my permission to used metal instead of wood, knowing that would leave marks on it. Eventually the succeeded in taking it out. The barrel was damaged. They repaired it, and while I was quite dis-hearted and wasn''t expecting my gun to perform well, it surprisingly did. I also tested the accuracy and it is unaffected. And I did not use the remaining bullets from that batch. However, I still cannot get over the fact that such a thing could happen to a brand new weapon made by a company renowned for its reliability. Someone said that it might be the bullets, that they might be old or fake, and I do believe that is the case. I bought another pack of Barnaul.

Lol, I have taken down small game at 50 yards with  gamo shadow which is a medium powered airgun. Jog3ee took down two crows with one shot at 70yards... Powerful airguns can do as much as 950fps the only issue remaining is the docking every time and recoil management[/QUOTE]\n\nWe are not underestimating the power, but due to the nature of springers those distances are rather hard to attain. For him those distances would not be possible,will take him a good while to achieve. \n\nFor hunting power and penetration are irrelevant. both are accurate out to the same ranges, both can take whatever game he wants to take, except the airrifle will not tear apart the meat. If they both can do whatever he wants, power is a useless figure to compare on.  \n\n@jog3ee\nYour words ring true. But the diana is neither polymer nor within his budget. A mod125 comes for about 20-25k but the Diana 34 with integrated supp has a foreign price of 300 USD.In pakistan, it will end up costing him about 40-50k, and that isent worth it if he can pick up a entry pcp for a little more. (the bnj i suggeted was because it is the cheapest PCP available.But i suppose he wont be purchasing that either, as it is in wood only.\n\nThe Fps rating you all state is misleading. High fps can be attained with super light weight PBA pellets and a weak rifle. If you want to compare them bring FPE (foot-pound) ratings into here.\n\n\nThe final choice that i would tell you to go for is the Mod 125, or the MOD 125 sniper, both from hatsan. they are powerful and have a combined silencer/muzzle brake to reduce kick and sound.

Only Hatsan has lived up to being close to what it claims. That is reason why I ONLY rely on actual chrony numbers. By the way the FPE is also dependent on FPS and every pellet will give you a different FPE with the same gun, e.g. My BT65 shoots Crosman Premier pellets at about 42 fpe, JSB 16 grains at approx 45 fpe, H&N 21 grain pellets at approx 47 fpe and JSB 25 grain pellets at 50 fpe.

More  American were killed in that conflict than all the wars put together. \r\n	There are six types of repeater shot guns up to date. By definition any shot gun which can fire more than one shells successively is a repeater, so DBBL, believe or not it is a type of repeater. Side by side shot guns are the most expensive ranging from $1200 to $ 100, 000 or even more but it is not the gun but it is Naveed behind the gun.

(603801, ' The final choice is what suits you best. When you go to make your heavily-anticipated purchase, make sure to fire off a few rounds and see if they suit you. Also Sand, the older a rifle is, the better it is. The spring and mechanical components take a while to break in. Dianas,Weihrauchs and high end beeman rifles are the kind that you pass on to your kids, and they to their charges. The fact that you used a 7 year old diana is not a boon, it is a Yay!\n\nAll the springers suggested here are good.get the one which suits you most after a few shots (dont ever blank fire, use pellets. Also ask if they allow their customers to blank fire their springers. If so, run out of that shop screaming at the top of your voice.)\nSomething like the higher end springers from Weihrauch, a RWS 350 or a Beeman R9 on the other hand, those are brilliant. But for springers you hit dimishing returns at about 300 USD, and for Pcps its about at the 500 mark.\n\nIm going to have to disagree with you jogee,\nI own a pathetic shadow 1000 (gun is nice and refined, but the trigger is just horrible.Doesn''t even break cleanly) And for the first 3-4 months i blamed everything but myself on my horrible accuracy(first it was my arm, then it was the scope, then it was the target,then wind conditions.But i kept it in the back of my mind what i read everywhere, the gun is better then you.\n\n Then i kept at it, re-zeroed the rifle a few times, and now(although im nowhere close to where i can pull off the max of my rifle) i''ve gotten much better.\nMy point is, a beginner no matter what he shoots will end up blaming the rifle. I can be better, but lack of muscle to support the weapon causes problems. Started working out, will see how that will end up.(this is also good advice for everybody using springers, WORK OUT. You will be more accurate,less fatigued , people will listen to you more, and your wife might just realise that you fit the salman khan image perfectly and proceed to favour you more. This also applies to unknown females on the street. \n\nSo what im saying is a greenhorn will always make mistakes and blame other things, and since this is his only rifle, its best that it can be one that he will grow into.', ''),
(603802, ' [QUOTE=Sand;441536]lol. AP would explode the moment you shoot, even if it were applied at the tip of the bullet. The shock alone would trigger it.\n\nMercury has a very heavy nucleus and it is a transition metal, translating to chemical bonds which are not very stable (unless bonded with extremely electronegative ions such as ... possibly flouride). Which means you cannot (in the absence of very regulated conditions) prepare an impact exploding bullet with most (if not all) mercury compounds.\n\nYes, the bullet caliber would have to be large. Plus the explosive would have to be packed in a casing which absorbs all shock waves coming from the rear side of the casing (you only want it to explode after the shock is generated at the front side, that is, when the bullet hits its target). Another thing which would help, would be to keep the bullet traveling at moderately low fps (so as to limit the chances of an accidental explosion due to shock generated at the rear side).\n\nI would have to admit one mistake in my former post btw. I was mentioning exploding arrows, not exploding bullets. My bad I got hyped and used the word bullet. Yes, preparing exploding bullets is an extremely hard and risky thing and you cannot improvise any at home. Exploding arrows, yes you easily can. I won''t go into any details as ... umm ... the seniors don''t like "such things" discussed around here.[/QUOTE]\n\nAP would go boom, hence why i mentioned it is very easy to set off. anybody wanting to make a boom bullet would do his research and realize that its not a good idea.\n\nMercury fulminate i suggested because its used in blasting caps, and hence is stable, easy to handle and use. But i admit i haven''t exactly researched it. Last time ive heard it anywhere is when it was used in Breaking Bad. \n\nFor a explosive bullet or something of the sort, I believe rifle rounds are not the answer. Its probably easier to use the most versatile firearm of all time,better known as the shotgun. A modified shell may work wonders.A shotgun shell (remove gunpowder, just use a small amount of primer,and a stable kaboom substance) and a type of cable leading back to the weapon(taser style) for electronic detonation.But the easiest way i can think of is to modify a shotgun into shooting a remotely stable explosive in a tandem fashion (like some RPG warheads) . The first is a stable explosive, second is a chemical compound or something of the sort to detonate it. I do have a faint idea of what chemicals CAN be used to make a setup like this, but as you know *cough cough* other *cough hackkkkkk cough * people *cough cough*  disagreeable* cough cough*', ''),

Although .22lr and 22 mag have their own features but one cannot feel much of difference in field. So interchanging of barrels would not be very essential. However, CZ 455 also offers .17hmr or .22mag. So it is your own choice. Go for youtube videos on these suplended cartridges .22lr, .22mag. .17hmr. As far as I am concerned two barrels .22lr, and .22mag are not very much necessary althoungh it is an extra feature. But the main thing to note is that .22lr have no match. When you will get more and more familier with it you will love it.\r\nAnd for your second question remember you will have to re-zero your rifle if you will ever change your calibre and even for same calibre with different grain weight bullet.\r\nHope you will understand if some thing else you want to ask then go ahead. \r\nsee you', ''),

(603849, ' @adam\n\nThat seems to be a quite interesting rifle.\nWhere did you get it from and for how much? Also Tell us if any brandings are present on it. \nIt seems to be a gem from china. If this can be found commonly, It might just be a good introduction for most people into air-gunning. \nAbout the trigger, all China airguns i have used have utterly horrific triggers. I needed 2 fingers to set em off. Fortunately, that rifle died after my uncle decided to dip it in oil ( Lol dieseling ) and Empty fire it. It made quite the bang, but it was never the same. The rifle itself was horrible, had no way at all to zero the sights and it would have been a miracle if i actually hit anything with it. \n\nSand, now that youve chosen your weapon, all i can tell you now is to work out a bit (especially the arm holding the rifle) and please dont blow darts though it. The one thing responsible for the accuracy, the rifling will be absolutely destroyed from that.Also you have no guarentee of mechanical components. If the beartrap mechanism fails while you are doing so, you will get whiplashed in the head by a 1.5kg barrel and if you are particularly unfortunate, your lips may get caught in the break barrel mechanism.( A small extension of this, is never to fire the rifle when empty, never fire it when the barrel is opened, and never try to "oil" it or anything of the sort. The most maintenance these rifles need is a dusting every now and then, plus a single drop ( SINGLE MEANS SINGLE ) of air gun oil (ask around for what ones are suitable, ( avoid non synthetic oils, as i believe they eat the rubber in the seals ) In the piston mechanism. If taken care of, it will probably outlive you, unlike most firearms.\n\nAir guns never need to undergo things like barrel replacements. The barrels do have a life of about...eternity. More then a few hundred thousand pellets, and in the case of some very good ones a million or so pellets can go through it without any damage whatsoever. ( this has been documented ) unlike most firearms which need barrel replacements every 2k-30k rounds (depending on caliber and pressure) and regular cleaning, oiling and brushing.( <- This is fun,to a degree, but don''t we all love low-maintenance ladies? )', ''),

While the idea is nice, that rather than carrying two rifles, you can get the work of two rifles done in just one.

First off, before the Tenifer    Treatment (Ferritic nitro carburising) argument kicks in, let me assure all of you that it was once exclusive to Austrian made Glocks but they too have discontinued it somewhere in mid 2011.

In addition, here''s another response to a customer''s email from Glock.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000]Subject: Generation 4 Finish\n\nMr. Downey,\n\nCurrent production Glock pistols do not have the Tenifer heat treating process.

That being said, Tenifer treatment is still being used as per Glock European Website ([URL]http://eu.glock.com/english/index_pistols.htm[/URL]). Nevertheless, the website is very sketchy, is more of external links guide and hasn''t been updated for a very long time now (I''m a frequent visitor). So I''m not buying information from this particular website. Besides, why would Glock Customer Support "lie".\n\nNow, understandably your Glock sustained some "bruises" after being dropped but I assure you that would have happened to even a Sig or maybe H&K. My previous Glock 17 Gen 4 (NPv markings, Made in Austria Ges.m.b.H) turned me slightly off after it''s barrel showed wear after maybe 200 rounds approximately. But worked flawlessly. There were two faint scratches which I couldn''t understand from where they came (I wish I had photos to show you guys). \n\nWhile purchasing this new G19 (Austrian but not NPv marked), I came across an H&K USP chambered in 9mm being sold as used.

(603874, ' *wink wink*\n\nI agree.\n\nI think the best home-made exploding projectile would be an arrow. You get extremely less launching shock (as opposed to extremely high shock when a bullet is fired) for an arrow and even relatively unstable explosives can be used on the arrowhead for that purpose.\n\nPlus, sir, you don''t need a charge to trigger the ignition of your explosive. For impact-explosives, you get to operate with very low weight (the whole setup can''t be more than 20 grams under any case), very little volume and very few installation options. I would say you would have to use only a single, one-stage explosive.\n\nIf you must use a "gun" for your purpose, I would say an airgun is the best thing for that purpose as you still have a lesser propulsion shock with an airgun than what you would get with a shotgun or any other firearm.

(603878, ' [QUOTE=Sand;441090]I do not know whether it is halal or not, but here is some food for thought:\n\nOnce a large lizard (goh) was brought roasted to Prophet Mohammad S.A.W. for eating. He did not take any piece of it and said to his companions (suhaba A.S.) that they can eat it.\n\nOne of my scholar friends told me that it is found in the narrations of the companions of Prophet Mohammad S.A.W. that they ate snake (not sure about it if he said these exact words, or was it something like that). Narrations also say that they ate a "wild donkey" (himar''un wah''shiun) which I would conjecture to be a zebra or other equine genus.\n\nI have myself read a whole long hadith in which there is a mention that the companions of Prophet Mohammad S.A.W. ate a giant "ambar fish" (which I think would be a species of the whale, by the descriptions of its size) which was found dead on the shore of a sea. It is worthy to note that the companions of the Prophet S.A.W. were on a recon mission in enemy territory and very wanting of food. However, they brought back some of its meat and the Prophet S.A.W. himself took a piece of it.\n\nWhile I am not a scholar of Islam, my THINKING on the subject (not a fatwa or whatever) is that other than the animals/things which are clearly mentioned as haram in the Holy Quran (which include the dead, the blood and the pork/swine/boar), only those things are haram which are meat eaters or carrion (dead bodies) eaters. All the rest would be halal. Remember again that this is just my thinking about the subject, not a valid knowledge or decree.[/QUOTE]\n\nNice share dear', ''),

(603913, ' Whats wrong with some harmless fantasizing. Its not like we are openly telling people how to construct these weapons.\n\n\nBack to the topic.\nArrows are good, but i think that a weight on them will kill the dynamics of the projectile , making it more or less useless. Although putting some cloth on the front , dousing it in alcohol and setting it aflame then shooting will work too. But its mainly just a morale-reducer, flaming arrows are less effective due to the loss in speed, and we live in concrete and metal not wood. \nFor impact explosives, they are by nature somewhat unstable. In a powder gun it will set off when shot, so thats why i was suggesting a compound that is electrically ignited as the safest bet.\n\nIm going to have to heavily disagree with you on the air gun, the caliber, the power and the size are all too little to make it work. And plus if you do modify it, the entire dynamics of the pellet is dead. gone. kapoof. ( ive tried to mod a few gamo promags so they can have ceramic nitrate/nitride tips, for easier penetration on bone but it dident work out. the amount of space to work with was far far too little. And if its just firing explosive pellets itself (i.e the pellet is the chemcial) it will deform and tear apart within the barrel, unless something specialized is made. \n\nI once again suggest a modified shotgun shell is the solution. \nWhat i think will work is a shell inside a shell .with some primer in between them to set it off and propel the second shell. The second shell is also made of plastic but using some...birdshot glued to the inner wall and the impact(or chemical ignition) substance at the base, and a type of piston at the front , with a flat side on one end (pointing toward the object) and a spur on the inside ( pointing toward the substance) when shot the smaller shell exits through the barrel (it can be rifled) and the primary is ejected. Then the blunt side hits the object or wall nearby the target and drives the chemical laden or just plain spur into the substance, initiating the poof and birdshot goes in the direction perpendicular to the length of the shell, or the same dimension as the base. This kind of thing will probably only be able to fit birdshot in it, as shells are too small for buckshot. It will probably end up being only useful for hunting sitting birds , as normally you can only get a shot at one, but with this all of them will be taken down.\n\n(note i dislike hunting with shotguns except when slugs are used. I consider this cheating, and just mass slaughter. So no flames about me going to try something like this. )', ''),

If you send me 25-rs-ka-easyload, I might resell it and obtain some to buy a Hydra syrup. Oh wait! You want me to drink Hydra''s blood? Or venom? Or what? :o :o :o\n\nMatapatapa sir, you are forgetting that arrows are invariably fit with an arrowhead, which is a rather heavy, sharp, metallic piece which does all the magic to the target. Now if you replace the metallic arrowhead with the explosive arrowhead, you can keep the projectile trajectory of the original arrow, while making it deadly.\n\nFlaming arrows aren''t so very deadly in our current times, due to advanced medical techs, but still if someone can manage to get some napalm poured on the arrowhead ... I don''t want to think about it. Plus sir, flaming arrows are/were of two types. The "common" flaming arrows, which the westerners used, were prepared just the way you stated. Soak the arrowhead in petroleum and set it on fire just before shooting. But the "alchemists" of the Muslims during the crusades came up with something far more deadlier. They applied thick petroleum jelly mixed with white phosphorus on the arrowheads and kept the arrowheads covered, to keep them from coming in contact with air. When they were uncovered and shot, the white phosphorus would ignite within the first one or two seconds of being shot, due to the heat of air friction. White phosphorus flame produces a very high ignition temperature and this, combined with the burning, sticky petroleum jelly literally set the arrowhead red-hot. But it was not only the extreme burning heat which was the terror to the christian troops. It was also due to the fact that burning phosphorus produces very acidic gases such as phosphorus pentoxide, which dissolve in any watery medium (such as blood) to produce several versions of phosphoric acids. Now you know why Saladin''s archers spread terror in the spanish knights.\n\nShooting someone with such an arrow even today would cause very severe wound which would not take weeks, but probably months to heal and that too, if medical aid is readily available. (They could also employ metallic sodium/potassium instead, but that was far too hard to prepare and too reactive to be of any practical use)\n\nI have no idea about the dynamics of an airgun pellet and how they impact the rifling of the barrel, so I can''t say anything about what will it do to the airgun barrel or what flight trajectory the explosive pellet will take. I THINK if you fill up an empty plastic cone of the right caliber with just gunpowder and shoot it in an airgun, it will go boom on contact. People in the west do that all the time with blowguns. That is, they shoot explosive darts in blowguns. Those fellows use different, more sensitive explosives than plain gunpowder (because a blowpipe dart travels at far lesser speeds than an airgun pellet. It is usually no more than 150 fps and that too, if you blow it hard enough).\n\nEDIT:\n\nWho on earth would prepare an impact-explosive dart, pellet or bullet to hunt? First off, an impact with flesh would probably not be as severe as an impact with a hard surface, such as concrete, metal or wood and there are fewer chances that the charge would go boom. Second, even if it does, it would completely destroy and absolutely destroy the meat. At least in the 1 cubic foot region where the bullet/pellet/arrow struck.\n\nThey were (and are, as in RPGs) always used as a war weapon, never as a hunting aid.', ''),

I don''t want to think about it. Plus sir, flaming arrows are/were of two types. The "common" flaming arrows, which the westerners used, were prepared just the way you stated. Soak the arrowhead in petroleum and set it on fire just before shooting. But the "alchemists" of the Muslims during the crusades came up with something far more deadlier. They applied thick petroleum jelly mixed with white phosphorus on the arrowheads and kept the arrowheads covered, to keep them from coming in contact with air. When they were uncovered and shot, the white phosphorus would ignite within the first one or two seconds of being shot, due to the heat of air friction. White phosphorus flame produces a very high ignition temperature and this, combined with the burning, sticky petroleum jelly literally set the arrowhead red-hot. But it was not only the extreme burning heat which was the terror to the christian troops. It was also due to the fact that burning phosphorus produces very acidic gases such as phosphorus pentoxide, which dissolve in any watery medium (such as blood) to produce several versions of phosphoric acids. Now you know why Saladin''s archers spread terror in the spanish knights.\n\nShooting someone with such an arrow even today would cause very severe wound which would not take weeks, but probably months to heal and that too, if medical aid is readily available. (They could also employ metallic sodium/potassium instead, but that was far too hard to prepare and too reactive to be of any practical use)\n\nI have no idea about the dynamics of an airgun pellet and how they impact the rifling of the barrel, so I can''t say anything about what will it do to the airgun barrel or what flight trajectory the explosive pellet will take. I THINK if you fill up an empty plastic cone of the right caliber with just gunpowder and shoot it in an airgun, it will go boom on contact. People in the west do that all the time with blowguns. That is, they shoot explosive darts in blowguns. Those fellows use different, more sensitive explosives than plain gunpowder (because a blowpipe dart travels at far lesser speeds than an airgun pellet. It is usually no more than 150 fps and that too, if you blow it hard enough).\n\nEDIT:\n\nWho on earth would prepare an impact-explosive dart, pellet or bullet to hunt? First off, an impact with flesh would probably not be as severe as an impact with a hard surface, such as concrete, metal or wood and there are fewer chances that the charge would go boom. Second, even if it does, it would completely destroy and absolutely destroy the meat. At least in the 1 cubic foot region where the bullet/pellet/arrow struck.\n\nThey were (and are, as in RPGs) always used as a war weapon, never as a hunting aid.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nI assumed that a explosive arrow head would be hard to make like a explosive bullet, and instead it would be like a sack dangling off one end ruining the dynamics. Thats why i said it would ruin it. Otherwise if you managed to integrate it into the head itself...well then your armed with one hell of a weapon. \n\nWith blowguns the surface and size of the projectile is enough to get it to work like that.  But with airguns, if you look at a pellet it is hollow. not much space to work with at all. only the very tip is made of solid lead. And to make it somewhat effective you would need a big bore airgun (like a dragon slayer or a sam yang) to actually fit enough substance. otherwise it will be mostly pointless.\n\nThe shell i described is not meant to shoot directly at the prey, but at a hard surface nearby. the birdshot will take care of the rest. this will allow taking of multiple animals moderately spaced out amongst one another (2-3 paces) at once compared to having to fire a shell for every one.', ''),

(603960, ' [QUOTE=Matapatapa;441781]Whats wrong with some harmless fantasizing. Its not like we are openly telling people how to construct these weapons.\n\n\nBack to the topic.\nArrows are good, but i think that a weight on them will kill the dynamics of the projectile , making it more or less useless. Although putting some cloth on the front , dousing it in alcohol and setting it aflame then shooting will work too. But its mainly just a morale-reducer, flaming arrows are less effective due to the loss in speed, and we live in concrete and metal not wood. \nFor impact explosives, they are by nature somewhat unstable. In a powder gun it will set off when shot, so thats why i was suggesting a compound that is electrically ignited as the safest bet.\n\nIm going to have to heavily disagree with you on the air gun, the caliber, the power and the size are all too little to make it work. And plus if you do modify it, the entire dynamics of the pellet is dead. gone. kapoof. ( ive tried to mod a few gamo promags so they can have ceramic nitrate/nitride tips, for easier penetration on bone but it dident work out. the amount of space to work with was far far too little. And if its just firing explosive pellets itself (i.e the pellet is the chemcial) it will deform and tear apart within the barrel, unless something specialized is made. \n\nI once again suggest a modified shotgun shell is the solution. \nWhat i think will work is a shell inside a shell .with some primer in between them to set it off and propel the second shell. The second shell is also made of plastic but using some...birdshot glued to the inner wall and the impact(or chemical ignition) substance at the base, and a type of piston at the front , with a flat side on one end (pointing toward the object) and a spur on the inside ( pointing toward the substance) when shot the smaller shell exits through the barrel (it can be rifled) and the primary is ejected. Then the blunt side hits the object or wall nearby the target and drives the chemical laden or just plain spur into the substance, initiating the poof and birdshot goes in the direction perpendicular to the length of the shell, or the same dimension as the base. This kind of thing will probably only be able to fit birdshot in it, as shells are too small for buckshot. It will probably end up being only useful for hunting sitting birds , as normally you can only get a shot at one, but with this all of them will be taken down.\n\n[B](note i dislike hunting with shotguns except when slugs are used. I consider this cheating, and just mass slaughter. So no flames about me going to try something like this. )[/B][/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Matapatapa;441820]I assumed that a explosive arrow head would be hard to make like a explosive bullet, and instead it would be like a sack dangling off one end ruining the dynamics.

First, you can''t operate it in all the angles which you can opearte a moon-sword, because one arm can move anywhere in all directions, but two arms together have very limited options in motion.

Their shape and their weight makes them very suitable for quick maeneuvers, fast attacks and a lot of dodging and parrying. You can''t do anything like that with a two-handed sword. First, you can''t operate it in all the angles which you can opearte a moon-sword, because one arm can move anywhere in all directions, but two arms together have very limited options in motion. Second, using two hands/arms together, your torso''s movement also gets restricted and rather "heavy".\n\nUgh, I just hate these big swords! :@[/QUOTE]\n\nIts just a matter of preference and training, I have seen people using Katanas single handed with a Tanto in the other (now that''s a deadly combination) and cousin of mine who is practically a Japanese (eats, sleeps, paints, lives like) while he is a Pakistani born dutch national living in Holland (man this sounds a lot weirder than I thought) has been awarded the highest grade/position of sword fighting from japan so I was watching one of his older videos and discussing the same with him as well.

While the Indian/Arabian swordplay involves more elements of quick movements and lots of parrying, the Japanese swordplay has more of power and "straightness" to it. Somewhat like the European swordplay I would say.\n\nThis does not only directly influence how quick you can attack, but also how much damage would your strike do. While it is much easier to land a contact with a lightweight/Indian/Arabian sword, one SLASHING strike of a moonsword very rarely results in immediate death. Usually, while you can critically injure your opponent with a couple of well placed strikes, you cannot often kill/disable him straight with a single slash. On the contrary, one successful contact by a katana or European sword translates directly to the loss of a limb, or the loss of life. And that too, very quickly.\n\nSo yes. It is about preferences.

(605056, 'Killed another snake in the house [B]KILLED ANOTHER SNAKE IN THE HOUSE\n\n[/B]Yesterday night as I was preparing to go to bed when my wife told me something is not correct outside. Gatekeepers son was running between building and boundary wall with a thick wood log ( used to contruct the side of Charpai ). Gatekeeper was not at home at that time perhaps it was 10:30 PM he was not feeling well so he sent his son and he spoted an about 2.5 to 3 feet snake between two cars parked in the porch. Porch is well lighted at night so everything on marble is clearly visible.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of observation I asked from window what was the problem?\n\nHe replied there is a snake between side lawn and porch, he used the thick wood but was not very effective for two reasons\nWood was too heavy to easily handle and hit at will & on spot\nSecond he was less experienced than his father ( who had a history of 50 years of killing snakes with sticks, stones etc. ) and scared a lot\n\nI analyzed the situation quickly and loaded my Hatsan Escort Aimguard Pump Action loaded with No.7 Shotshells.\n\nFrom the previous encounter with the snake I got a firearm cupboard Custommade and reserved one section strictly for Pest Control particularly big lizards and Snakes. loaded this section with 2 shotguns one PA and other Baikal SA with a full belt of snake shotshells No.7 ( My favourite ), 8 & 9S and about a dozen No.7 loose shotshells and also .22LR shotshells but I seriously doubt there effectiveness.\n\nI dont know why but in crises situation I always prefer Pump Action over Semi Auto no matter how much expensive or superior semi auto is.\n\nSo, I loaded my PA with 7+1 No.7 Shotshells took my torch ( with very sharp beam option which can blind the snake if required ) and in a couple of minutes I reached the scene. Although gatekeepers son managed to hit it once or twice but snake was clearly moving and in an aggressive mood, which was obviously not a good thing.\n\nI handed over the torch to boy and told him to manipulate the snake with wooden stick so the snake come far from cars and in the middle of side lawn ( which is in front of big hall, I am not talking about the front lawn ). By the way side lawn is also not small by any means.\n\n\nAnyhow coming to the point, the poor thing never realized and come exactly where I desired it should be.\n\nI calmed down , racked the PA ( Oh my GOD!!! what a pleasure to rack the PA when you are in a real action ), aimed it held my breath and pulled the trigger.\n\nFollowing is the result\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]30862[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30861[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30863[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30864[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30865[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30866[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30867[/ATTACH]\n\nIt was a single trigger pull and job done. When fired "At The Site of Impact" snake disappeared to our surprise but after a little search found the head end of the body completely separated from the rest. Then I crushed it''s head thoroughly with a brick and left the rest to the morning.\n\nIn the morning light found the rest of the body for pictures for my Dear Pakgun members\n\nHere is the final burial place of poor snake.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]30868[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30869[/ATTACH]\n\nThis is the second incident in less than a year although I somehow managed it but it might and very well be just Good luck only what if the luck is not too good.\n\nAny anti snake measures other than sealing the windows and doors ( they are already fixed after the first incident ) ?\n\nSuggestions and comments are welcomed.\n\nRegards', ''),

(605031, 'Winter War humor Back in 1939 the Axis Powers began invading chunks of Europe, Africa, and the Near East.  As part of its expansion, the Soviet Union decided to conquer Finland.  The Red Army marched into Finland with overwhelming military superiority - three times as many soldiers, the latest modern equipment, and plenty of supplies.  On paper, it should have been an easy victory.  Instead... it became the "Winter War", with the Red Army humiliated by the Finns.  Finally, a treaty was negotiated with Finland losing only part of its territory; the Soviets desperately needed those troops elsewhere, and the war with Finland was consuming vast amounts of men and material.  Both sides declared a victory and the border was redrawn.\r\n\r\n The Finns made heavy use of two things - submachine guns and snipers. \r\n\r\n Most armies were either looking at getting some SMGs or had some already in service, but they were still set in the "don''t waste ammunition" mindset that thought five rounds in a rifle was enough, and not only that, soldiers were expected to load and fire only one round at a time.  The Finns had lots of Suomi SMGs, plenty of ammunition, and used them as "bullet hoses", pretty much like we do today.\r\n\r\n The Finns also made extensive use of snipers.  The most famous of those was Corporal Simo Heyha, who became known as "The White Death."  Heyha racked up 505 official kills, the most of any sniper in history.  He did that all in 100 days, before being shot and hospitalized until after the war was over.  Heyha and his companions thoroughly demoralized the Soviet troops, who eventually got so jumpy they were calling in air strikes and artillery fire against anything they thought they saw in the woods.\r\n\r\n The Soviet troops weren''t quite as incompetent as some people make them out to be.  But Stalin had executed most of the Red Army''s experienced staff officers by then, and the new, politically-correct ones were learning on the job.  Also, the Red Army was mostly conscripts with poor training.  They learned on the job too, but there simply wasn''t time for them to learn what they needed before the wider political situation forced Moscow to pull them out and send them south.\r\n\r\n So, with all that in mind, we have a bit of humor handed down from the Red Army...\r\n\r\n\r\nA large group of Russian soldiers in the border area in 1939 are moving down a road when they hear a voice call from behind a small hill: "One Finnish soldier is better than ten Russians!"\r\n\r\nThe Russian commander quickly orders ten of his best men over the hill whereupon a gun battle breaks out and continues for a few minutes, then silence.\r\n\r\nThe voice once again calls out: "One Finn is better than one hundred Russians!"\r\n\r\nFurious, the Russian commander sends his next best hundred troops over the hill and instantly a huge gun fight commences.\r\n\r\nAfter 10 minutes of battle, again silence.\r\n\r\nThe calm Finnish voice calls out again:  "One Finn is better than one thousand Russians"\r\n\r\nThe enraged Russian commander musters a thousand soldiers and sends them to the other side of the hill. Rifle fire, machine guns, grenades, rockets and cannon fire ring out as a terrible battle is fought.... then silence again.\r\n\r\nEventually one badly wounded Russian soldier crawls back over the hill and with his dying words tells his commander, "Don''t send any more men... it''s a trap. There''s two of them!"', ''),

In addition, the interior of the Mercs was outdated and nothing to talk about. So Mercedes took a huge sales and financial hit, because they thought they were the ''bees nees''.

(605157, ' [a repost of an old favorite]\n\nA Review On A Crude Copy of the World War II Japanese Nambu Type 14\n\nInstruction From The Editor To The Journalist: Frangible Arms just bought a four page color ad in our next issue. They sent us their latest offering, the CQB MK-V Tactical Destroyer. I told Fred to take it out to the range to test. He&#8217;ll have the data for you tomorrow.\n\nFeedback From Technician Fred:\n\nThe pistol is a crude copy of the World War II Japanese Nambu type 14 pistol, except it&#8217;s made from unfinished zinc castings. The grips are pressed cardboard. The barrel is unrifled pipe. There are file marks all over the gun, inside and out.\n\nOnly 10 rounds of 8mm ammunition were supplied. Based on previous experience with a genuine Nambu, I set up a target two feet down range. I managed to cram four rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. I taped the magazine in place, bolted the pistol into a machine rest, got behind a barricade, and pulled the trigger with 20 feet of 550 cord. I was unable to measure the trigger pull because my fish scale tops out at 32 pounds. On the third try, the pistol fired. From outline of the holes, I think the barrel, frame, magazine, trigger and recoil spring blew through the target. The remaining parts scattered over the landscape.\n\nI sent the machine rest back to the factory to see if they can fix it, and we need to replace the shooting bench for the nice people who own the range. I&#8217;ll be off for the rest of the day. My ears are still ringing. I need a drink.\n\nArticle Produced By The Journalist:\n\nThe CQB MK-V Tactical Destroyer is arguably the deadliest pistol in the world. Based on a combat proven military design, but constructed almost entirely of space age alloy, it features a remarkable barrel design engineered to produce a cone of fire, a feature much valued by Special Forces world wide. The Destroyer shows clear evidence of extensive hand fitting. The weapon disassembles rapidly without tools. At a reasonable combat distance, I put five holes in the target faster than I would have thought possible. This is the pistol to have if you want to end a gunfight at all costs. The gun is a keeper, and I find myself unable to send it back.', ''),

All active small firearm manufacturers in KPK must pool in their resources to establish a shooting range in consultation with a panel of knowledgeable Shooting Enthusiasts.\n\n2. The proposed RANGE should be affiliated with NRAP and they must encourage efforts for finding young talent in shooting sports.NRAP must facilitate Duty Free import of Clay Traps and help the range owners to get Shaheen cartridges on subsidized rates otherwise go for imported ones with NIL import duty. Range authorities will ensure 90% usage of local GUNS.\n\n3. DSA must start developing an affordable but sturdy CLAY shooting O/U,Which should initially be launched for shooting at major shooting centers of Pakistan, but on minimum rental charges only. Shotguns will remain under DSA''s ownership. Breakdowns due  to  bad handlings would be charged to range authorities.\n\n4. The proposed range should be constructed on a Govt allocated Land and that piece of land would remain property of Provincial Govt and they will have the right to cancel allotment in case, the range management doesn''t comply with the given directives.\n \n     The day any local shooter will Win the national medal with a DSA product, their products will sell like WAVES FREEZERS or ROOH AFZA and CHAUNSA OR ANWAR RATHORE mangoes.', ''),

Out of the Turkish pistols it is the best, all are basically copies of the CZ 75.\nThe Sarasilmaz B6, and the ST-9 both had problems the springs on the striker fired ST 9 were weak and it is too complicated with small parts although it is the most comfortable pistol to shoot when shooting hundreds of rounds in one session I found it way more comfortable than even a Glock and a Walther P99 we  were using for comparison, but the ST 9 had frequent stoppages the B6 was much better although crude with problems with the rear sight, surprisingly the PK 9 was much better in accuracy than all the Turkish pistols.  \nThe Zigana is crude and designed poorly although again the basic design is a copy of CZ 75.\nThe Canick is better than most Turkish pistols and that is all I would say.', ''),

Gourmet grill managers and those of gaming zones only have a monthly walk away of 40-90.Sure the revenues are high, and they love to tell others that they make 3-5 lakh a month, but if you ask them how much is actually profit, what they walk away with,you can see their expressions go down the drain. Only people who break that 1lak limit are highly paid govt employees, grade 18+ i think, and bank managers who make about 2-3 lakh a month. \n\nThis is of course, not the owners/manager of pearl continental,the owners of housing societies or the ceo of nishat linen that i''m speaking of(far too little people like that to say middle class) , its about upclass businesses like the manager of a branch of gourmet, or the gourmet grill,or shopkeepers in upscale areas like DHA. \n\nCompare this to the average upscale business manager (of a single branch mind you) in a foreign country. \nTalking to them, they say they have monthly walk aways of about roughly...4-6000 USD.

Most come on cars, some bought with loans and others with saved up cash.\nAlso the people living in the cantonment areas, ive visited them. they say they have a monthly income of no more then 50k yet there is a mehran in the garage.\nAdmittedly they moonlight after hours but it as this shows, it is possible. The majority of the cars if you actually pay attention are old 06 and 04 corollas,purchased back when the economic boom hit.Extraordinarily few people purchased a new one after that.\n\nWhen i first joined, i was assuming everybody here to be landowners or ceos of franchises.\n\nBut you are as i told you before, using the wrong yardstick. A vehicle is a necessity. A gun is a hobby/toy that can be done without. With that in mind, even people with 1-1.5lak incomes are rather hesitant to blow 50k on a firearm. Its not something that can be done without a few months of saving and planning. unless a person is making a minimum of 3 lakh a month( IMHO ), i dont think a purchase like that can be made comfortably without stretching your wallet out of proportion. To put that in perspective, a low class household in a foreign country makes roughly 1800-2000 a month. And they have to pay for more expensive food,clothes,insurance you name it. People like them have to wait and count their dollars to purchase a firearm there. \n\nAnd you are talking about buying a toy, priced for the foreign market and the average expendable income there, made for the foreign market, imported so raise it even more, and buy it here with a even lower average income?\n\nSo what im saying is that yes you can own a vehicle on 40-60k, my teachers, and some of my less well off neighbours do it rather well be it by loan or saving, and unless you have enough income here to be the same as the people in foreign countries for whom the firearm is priced and marketed to, i dont see you making a easy purchase. \n\nDont mean to be offensive but unless you are a high roller here, i don''t see you,me or anyone else purchasing that kind of thing.\n\nPS\ni have no idea what my post is now, i lost track of it halfway through. now its just a jumble.

That works out to about 9300 a month, and up it to 10k with interest.\nout of 60k, about 15 more is spent in running it. 25k \nthat leaves us 35k from one job.\nadd the usual 30k more from moonlighting, that makes 65k left over.\n30k for necessities,(electricity,water,food)\n35k is left for random spending around,or to be applied where they see fit.\nQuite liveable no?\nin your 60k figure you took from me, you forget about moonlighting.\nAgreed, the middle class there is quite a bit worse off. But, as one of my friends puts it, ( he moved to NZ a while back ) "being poor there(pakistan) is actually being poor, but being poor here is (NZ) being rich comparatively. Here no load shedding, free healthcare,child benefits and support from the state, i would go on but i cant think of any more points"\n\nPeople do complain about taxes, but you will be surprised. Its a progressive tax there. A person earning 6k a month will end up 4.5-5k walk away. However...the funny thing is, if you exceed the 100k per year limit, and make 10k a month, you will end up with 6. The more you make,the more gets taken from you.I hate it, as it lets people who don''t work for themselves get off for free,and we don''t want to pay for all of the govt projects. Just those that we like. If it were as you stated,that insane tax was applied the 2k a month earners wouldn''t be able to eat, let alone live a decent life.If taxes were like as you stated Ashes....well i''m never going to europe then.\n\nPeople buy guns left right and center here mainly, because of Darra guns. Try selling them imports and nobody,almost nobody will purchase one. The majority of the people here, the majority of the security guards are all armed with darra weapons.Then they sell them and move on to the next weapon. Ever wandered around in a village mobile shop? people buy a phone, and swap it out for another like toothpicks every other day.You can counter this by saying buy something from daudsons, or POF, but not enough people purchase those for it to be considered a real competitor to daara guns. \n\nThe richer person? i dont think either one of them is the richer person. But i do think the westerners are blessed with guns that dont blow up in your hand and can be repaired (looking at you Darra ) then what we have. \n\nI am surprised, like Eng that you came back. Once a person has settled there, and adopted their lifestyle, you cant really come back here and just..fit in. especially if you spent your childhood there.\n\nSo the bottom line is, nither is really richer then the other, but to buy a gun made for the foreign market, and priced accordingly, you will have to be making a similar amount of disposable income. Which in pakistan makes you a filthy rich guy.\n\nAddendum=\n\nI had a look at the  per capita income yearly of the USA, canada, and pakistan.There it is 53k, here it is a small 14.5k USD\n\nSo we have freedom and they have taxes and benefits ?\n\n:hurt:', ''),

(605525, 'Taurus 24/7 G2 Review For a while, the looks of this gun has tempted me. But i was reluctent to but it because of the ammo sensitivity issues that the previous model of 24/7 had. But when i sold my beloved Caracal F, i was desperately looking for its replacement. That led me to buy Canik55 TP-9. Which was well not such a good gun, with rubbish trigger. The only thing good about it was the holster. Can''t say anything good about anything else. So when i went to PARA and saw and held the 24/7 G2 in my hand, i was instantly in love with its handsome looks and feel of this gun. But a good looking gun that doesn''t work well is of no good. Specially when PT92 was also available as a other option. A fellow PG member(Soldier Bro) was very helpful & kept asking me to not to take chance and waste money on another striker fired gun and buy a PT92 and live a hassle free life. But do i listen to good advise, No! I guess i''m a sucker for Striker fired guns or maybe a fool who keeps on experimenting. Anyways bought this beauty reluctantly. Good for you Pakgunner, You have me and can always learn from my mistakes ;). OH! and there is AK47 bro too lol. So Got home, De-greased the gun, oiled it lightly. Couldn''t sleep well all night wondering how it''s gonna perform the next morning. But when the time for big test came the gun performed like a Champ. Made me so happy look :whoo:.\nSay what you will about Taurus. But they make better guns then TP-9 lols. \n\n[COLOR=#0000ff][U][I][SIZE=4][B]Overview\n[/B][/SIZE][/I][/U][/COLOR]\nThe gun come in nice sturdy plastic box like most of Taurus handguns. In the box is the gun itself along with 2 Magazines(17 rounds), Mag loader, 2 extra back straps(L, M and S), cleaning brush, owners manual, which also serves as a warranty card and 2 set of keys for the Taurus Security System.

It''s gust few K''s less then a CZ''s, but its not any less of a gun then a Cz. Taurus have successfully made a reliable striker fired gun with ton of features and extremely good looks.

(605540, ' OK. So I went out today afternoon (evening rather, as I got pretty late :(  ) and gave this little toy some work. The next cat-astrophy that broke  was that the camera of my samsung tablet readily took great pictures of  everything except the sword! It was really really weird and a hell lot  annoying. But oh well. So I just ended up using my little nokia 208 for  the pics. Somehow it still gave reasonable results and saved my pants  (so to say, for I wasn''t wearing pants, as you would see)\n\nFirst off, here are a couple of pics about the environment, so that you know the test settings.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0024_zps28e86009.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0025_zpse9ede8d0.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI simply placed the thing (just as it came, inside it''s plastic scabbard) on the ground and took the first pic.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0010_zps1238460b.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThen I did the obvious.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0011_zps3fcd726b.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]THE GRIP[/B]\n\nThe handle/grip/hilt has a leather-strap finish which gives high  friction and very good hold. However, it doesn''t look very beautiful. I  think if the finishing was done with a single (or at most two) round  piece, it would have worked and looked much better. Also notice that the  wrapping is thicker around one point. Also near the blade end of the  grip, there is a slight profusion which occurs only at ONE side of the  grip. This does not have any negative impact on the grip quality, but it  makes the experience of holding the sword damn lot annoying. Just  imagine yourself holding something which has a small bulge at one point.  Ugh!\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0012_zps0b734c9b.jpg[/IMG]\nThe grip.\n\n[B]THE HAND GUARD[/B]\n\nLike all other swords, this one also has a disk which separates the grip  from the blade. The dude asked me which hand guard design would I like  to get installed on my order. He sent me 6 designs and I selected this  one. It is sturdy, heavy, thick and beautiful. Absolutely no complaints  with it. Totally great!\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0013_zpsf2674d32.jpg[/IMG]\nHand guard: grip side view.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0014_zpscc8bb5f2.jpg[/IMG]\nHand guard: blade side view.\n\n[B]THE BLADE[/B]\n\nNow comes the core part; the blade. The blade of this piece is thick,  sturdy and beautiful. The dude had sent it blunt in the first delivery  so I sent it back to him and he sharpened it for me. Well, it is not as  sharp as a razor blade (nor would I prefer it to be), but it sure is as  sharp as an axe. This means that if you run your fingers on the blade  without pressing hard on it, you won''t get cut. But if you run your  fingers hard against it, it will easily cut your skin. And in case the  blade falls on one of your fingers from a height of 18 inches or so, you  would have to live the rest of your life with one less finger. One  advantage of not being razor sharp is that you can strike it on many  objects without the fear of damaging it''s sharpness. So while it is just  as sharp as an axe, its sharpness is durable.\n\nThere are dark gray parabola shaped patterns on the blade (which has a  light gray base) which look very beautiful (to me at least, that is).  This is the signature mark of "damascus steel". The blade is 26 inches  on the long (blunt) side and 25 inches on the short (sharp) side.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0015_zpsb0733fbc.jpg[/IMG]\nDamn the samsung tablet! If it had worked efficiently, you would have a  clear look of the gray patterns on the steel. You can still see them,  although not as clearly.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0016_zps035590c4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]ALIGNMENT[/B]\n\nThere is a slight alignment issue with the blade which means that the  blade and the grip/handle are not in a straight line. The difference is  not easily visible. Only if you look at the blade line carefully, you  can notice it. Or if you hold the sword and carefully rotate it in your  hand, feelting it''s weight orientation, you would notice that the weight  slightly "pulls" to one side. This issue was more obvious when the  sword came first. I reported it to the dude (and didn''t mention it here,  because I didn''t want to degrade them, because a bad alignment is a  considered a blunder with swords/knives). He said that I was right and  apologized for it and tried to fix it. However, according to him, the  issue could be resolved completely only if the blade was pulled off the  grip and was worked on, again. He said that this was not possible now  that the blade had been tightly sealed to the grip :(  Anyhow, now the alignment issue is reduced to very minor scale and  other than giving me a sense of incompleteness and imperfection, it has  no other implications.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0018_zps982dbc49.jpg[/IMG]', ''),
(605541, ' [B][COLOR=#ff0000](REVIEW CONTINUED)[/COLOR][/B][COLOR=#ff0000]\n\nI have had to split the review into two posts, because according to forum rules, you cannot post more than 15 images in a single post.[/COLOR][B]\n\nSTRIKE RESULTS[/B]\n\nI struck at a short twig of thickness nearly 0.8 inches. The blade did  not cut it through (the twig was resting on nothing, the strike was made  at the twig in mid-air), but the force of the blow pulled the twig from  it''s root and it fell down to the ground with a cut mark on it. Haha.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0020_zps9a56ec25.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI placed the uprooted twig on the ground and struck again on another  (slightly thicker than before) point. This time the twig was easily cut  into two and the shorter piece fell several feet away. The blade marked a  deep (nearly 0.5 inches) cut mark in the earth below the point of  impact.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0021_zps8e8e8162.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI picked up one of the pieces and examined it if the cut edge was jagged  or smooth. It was very smooth, meaning that the blade had faced almost  no resistance while cutting it. This amount of sharpness is what I like  for my swords. Some friends here might prefer a razor-sharp blade, but I  know that although this one is axe-sharp, one determined strike with it  will go through the muscle and break an arm bone, while it will  definitely pass through the thigh muscle and only come to rest at the  bone. This means that you cannot actually chop off the heads and send  them flying as you see in the movies, but you can easily inflict fatal  damage with a single strike.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0022_zpsa2ef0520.jpg[/IMG]\nWhen the twig was resting against a hard surface (ground), the blade easily passed through it without any friction.\n\n[B]SWING TEST[/B]\n\nSince I am/was a student of Indian swordplay, I obviously tried to swing  it like the lightweight moon-swords (aka Indian swords or ''talwar'').  This thing was too heavy to swing quickly enough for my taste and I also  had to begin with two hands :(  With a moon-sword you don''t need a two handed hold at any point. I also  couldn''t risk doing "monkey-jumps-over-the-moon" as I was afraid I  might end up clipping one of my toes, or feet-fingers, or in the worst  case, end up like the dude in "Girlfriend From Hell" story. Anyhow, the  fluency and weight balance of the sword was very pleasant. Only it was  heavier than it should have been, for proper, quick swinging.\n\n[video]http://s287.photobucket.com/user/lone_REBEL/media/sreview/maya_dance_zps420c2727.mp4.html[/video]\n\n[B]A SLASH IN THE BARK[/B]\n\nOn my way back, I saw a thick eucalyptus (sufaida) tree and decided to  slash at it, to see how much would be blade pierce in it. The stem was  one foot thick (give or take an inch). I struck with 80% of my force. I  was expecting the blade to pierce into the stem and hold there. Although  it did make an inch deep gash in the bark and the hard-wood inside, I  was surprised that the blade actually bounced back after piercing  instead of getting stuck there, as an axe would have. This was a slight  disappointment. The impressive thing was that the blade did not bend or  it''s sharpness affected. It was all the same as before. This is what  damascus steel is known for: durability.\n\n[IMG]http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll136/lone_REBEL/sreview/Photo0023_zps36220a29.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]FINAL VERDICT[/B]\n\nNotice that I am no judge of swords. The ratings I post here are  according to my personal choice and taste. Other members could have a  totally difference view.\n\nUsefulness as a personal defense weapon: 7/10 (you can make fatal  injuries with it, but you cannot be very quick in your strikes)\n\nDurability: 8/10 (the blade is simply great, but the blade is not everything)\n\nBeauty: 9/10 (very beautiful to look at, when outside the scabbard. the  grip thing and the rear piece of the grip let it down a bit)\n\nCraftsmanship and finishing: 4/10 (yeah. really!)\n\nOverall satisfaction: 6.5/10 (in one word you can call it "OK")\n\nShould you order something exactly like it? No, don''t. Although the  blade is impressive, the "feel" of the sword overall is not very  satisfying. If you want to order something like this, make sure you  specify some aspects particularly how you want them to be. Pay special  attention to the grip, grip finish, how sharp you want it to be and how  heavy/light you want it to be.', ''),

The only reason i choose G2 over pt92 is because its light weight then 92, slimmer then 92 and barrel length is also less. So this make it a better choice for Conceal carry. Otherwise Pt92 is a great gun too......', ''),
(605589, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;443423]Sir, is it possible to shoot the first round in SA  after racking the slide. Or does the decocker only work for subsequent shots.[/QUOTE]\n\nMaybe i couldn''t explain correctly. On a empty gun, When you insert a loaded mag, and rack the slide, the bullet is now chambered right. The trigger pull will be DA mode. The gun will fire, the slide will move back and forward cambering another round. Now the trigger will be in the SA mode. Until the mag is emptied or you decock the gun manually. If you do decock the gun the trigger will go back to DA mode. That''s the only deference in the 24/7 G2 and hammer fired gun. I hope this cleared thing :)', ''),

Pros and cons of this gun are almost the same. Rite now i can''t think of any cons of this gun, apart from the trigger pull. Its not that bad. Slightly heavier then the other gun i''ve shot. Or lets say its trigger pull weight is slightly more then of Pt92''s. But it will get better the more i shoot it.

The swinging (or dancing) is the tech you use to intimidate your opponent and confuse him as to where and when the strike will come. Then you have to merge your swinging action into a strike, to make a successful assault.\n\nIt goes like ... you swing your sword around yourself and your opponent in quick circles. The motive of this step is to make your opponent retreat and take the defensive form. It is then that you suddenly change a swinging action into a strike. Usually battles in Indian swordplay are decided with a single strike. Not that it is a lethal strike, but one successful strike is easily capable of incapacitating your opponent.\n\n[QUOTE=shahroze]I am a little dissapointed with the sword when it did not cut deep in  the eucalyptus tree I was thinking it should have gone atleast have an  inch but the cut looks too small...

After ensuring that the magazine is out and chamber empty, insert the pallet directly in the chamber, followed by 6mm blank. Start busting targets. All safety rules apply. \n\nAfter shooting the handgun at target, rack the slide manually to remove spent blank. You will find nil recoil, low noise, superb accuracy along with better trigger control and sight picture.\n\nOnly one caution, the 6mm blanks are mildly corrosive and needs solvents to remove buildup in barrel and chamber.\nAt the range of 10 meters, accuracy is usually around MOA.\n\nEnjoy the safe and accurate shooting.', ''),

Much like wars. \n\nI do let lizards off(BC they eat other bugs(and their tail dropping action is cool)), but cockroaches are my mortal enemy.

They just go POP and die in 0.2 of a second. Pesticide, and stepping on them usually results in it staying there, suffering extreme muscle spasams and dying slowly. Plus they dont feel pain.

You know something is wrong, but dont feel it. They are much like small logic circuits these cockroaches. Flee in the light, mate, eat any and everything "including dead cockroaches and wounded"\n\nNow to the interesting part. Most insecticides have what is a external circulation system. The lines (horizontal) in the cockroach you see? those are blood vessel type things. Blood passes roughly through them. no real direction,it just pools around. for a small  insectoid that system works rather well.This system allows them to have a very low internal blood pressure, almost the same as atmospheric pressure so even if their head is cut off or whatnot, they can live,as they will not "bleed out" like us mammals do.\n Plus they only have to split their cells once in their lifetime(mostly), so for the most part insects cells cannot ionize from radiation(our cells ionize all the time.A bio student or doctor here could elaborate much better then my ham fisted attempt). So if the USA, Russia, and China decide to have a go at each other, these guys will be the rulers of the earth.\n\n Spiders, are too small to have proper muscles and only have a few. Instead their heart increases the blood pressure in a specific limb and this in turn extends the legs. However the mouth and the retractors are all muscle.Same low pressure open circulation, and benefits apply.\n\n@everyone\nAs per naming the thread...\n"evil creatures of the night"\n"demons of the dark"\n"night monsters"\nare far better then just "Things"', ''),

You want to discuss the venom effects of arthropods? Very well, here we go.\n\nIn cases of bearable pain stimuli, the reaction is usually that of enhanced level of activity in the affected creature. However, under conditions of extreme, unbearable pain, there is almost zero reaction, as the creature is stupefied by the extent of pain. For an example, try search for "Box Jellyfish" and how it''s sting affects humans. They state that many of the victims suffer a heart stroke underwater due to the extreme pain they suffer!\n\nCarrying on, have you seen someone with a mild headache? They just appear uneasy and don''t complain. Seen anyone with severe headache? They would probably be moaning in pain or crying out loud. Highly unbearable headache? They would be moaning even louder. Seen someone undergoing extreme migraine attack? You will hardly see the person yelling or shouting out loud. They would just be laying still, with a haggard, drawn out expression on their face. The severeness of pain deprives them of all energy, leaving them unable to even shout out! In some cases, people undergoing extreme pain (multiple major fractures) simply go into coma out of severe pain.\n\nPepsis venom does permanently paralyze the host, but here host implies only a Tarantula. A Pepsis sting has never been reported to paralyze a human being permanently (or even for an extended period of time). For a comparison, Black Widow has a "real" paralyzing agent in it''s venom and that 2 cm little assassin actually paralyzes a 80 kg human being for 12 hours, killing them easily through respiratory failure. And notice that the Black Widow injects almost the same amount of venom through it''s bite as a Pepsis does through it''s sting.\n\nLets talk about the Buthidae scorpions. These are known as some of the most venomous scorpions on the face of earth. Even these can kill a grown up human being with one sting, although they are nearly the same size as a Pepsis and transfer nearly an equal amount of venom.\n\nOn the contrary, a Pepsis sting has not been regularly reported to cause paralysis in a human or any large animal. Instead, it''s sting is reported as "shockingly electric" and the victim spasmodically shakes the affected limb for at least one minute.\n\nAlthough science has helped us understand a great deal about animals, it does not mean that it has told us everything. While scientists can now make an educated guess about how insects "probably feel", it by no means 100% defines how an insect really feels like. So while you are right when you state that insects do not have dedicated pain sensation segment of the brain, it would be very careless and vain to state that they practically feel or don''t feel any pain.\n\n@Surg Ray:\n\nThanks brah. I try. I''ve been in his shoes and I understand how it feels like. Feels like you are the odd man out in the whole forum :( Doesn''t feel good.', ''),

Pair of Russians are one of the best things to have around. Also correct, as someone wrote, that you should not wait for the snake to show-up. \nSnakes do not like vegetation free areas, clear bushes, grasses that are surrounding your house, preferably with fire.\nI have seen some stick pads available at Alfatah Store, originally designed to hold rats and lizards. Maybe they are available in size that covers your house enterence. \nSnake charmer is logical choice.\nPlease double check the sewer and drains of your house.

We are taking good care and have watchful eyes on sewerage system but it seems perfectly fine nothing not even a rat is spotted in more than last one year.\n\nWhat is spotted is snakes & scorpions, yes scorpions are also frequent but they are repelled by insect repellants and killing them is quite easy. After proper sealing of aluminum(exterior) windows only a couple of scorpions were spotted last Summer one was already dead and the second I crushed under my thick boats.\n\nOutside the house or even in the lawn etc. firing a 12G Shotgun is not an issue at all you can get desired distance 7 to 10 yards for a 7 to 10 inch spread of 400-680 pellets (No.7 or 9S), a desired angle to avoid ricochet.\n\nBut spotted inside the building or even worse a small place like washroom, laundary room try to use .22LR CCI Shotshells / Ratshots.

(606011, 'Lee-Enfield miscellaneous information I found some stuff I''d written about the Lee-Enfield a while back, and thought you guys might be interested.  The messages are mostly about a No.1 conversion to 7.62x54R that turned into a No.4 conversion to .45-70.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n9-25-2009, 10:53 PM #4\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nI brought the receiver in from the shop. It says:\r\n\r\nMA\r\nLITHGOW\r\nS.M.L.E.\r\nIII *\r\n1942\r\n\r\nI had a 1945 model in the ''80s, and got rid of it after determining the receiver was made out of cast iron. I was dressing a few rough spots with a file, and metal was coming off in the usual dark powder like iron does, instead of bright shavings like most steels.\r\n\r\nThis one is also a casting. It must be some pretty good stuff; I''d never heard of an SMLE failure, and I just spent some time googling as well. There are a lot of SMLEs out there around a century old, and a lot of them shot bunches of that hot Greek machine gun ammunition that was on sale everywhere in the ''80s.\r\n\r\nThe cast iron part worries me because it''s a rear locking lug action, and (apparently in the interest of removing weight) there''s darned little metal connecting the barrel ring to the locking lugs. On the right side, there''s even a slot that looks like a "don''t do this" example out of any engineering textbook. The bolt looks like a pencil compared to anything bigger than a .22LR. Yet they appeared to be reliable in service, and even American commercial .303 ammunition is no joke.\r\n\r\nComparing a Remington 788 (a common commercial rear-locking action) and an SMLE, I get the urge to hide my eyes and make small whimpering noises.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a bolt action the SMLE is quite unusual. Rear locking is unusual, of course. Since there are no forward locking lugs in the receiver, the lugs on the bolts cam into slots cut in the rear sidewalls. The closing cams are around 30 degrees, and about half again as long as the actual lug bearing area. Enfield really, *really* wanted you to be able to get off that next shot.\r\n\r\nThe bottom front edge of the left bolt lug rides an extraction ramp of about 30 degrees, perhaps double the width of the bolt mating surface. That''s the main extraction force. The firing pin spring is quite stout, and probably provides sufficient extraction force all by itself.\r\n\r\nThe right outer locking face is, as I mentioned, just a cut in the sidewall, like some .22 or .410 bolt actions. The left side is machined into the side of the wall from the inside. I can see end mill cutter marks in there. It looks like you could reach in there with a quarter inch end mill for the basic recess, then a 3/8 or 1/2" keyseat cutter for the closing ramp.\r\nThat assumes they were actually cut; if the receiver is an investment casting, the whole cutout could be cast. Final machining could cut the right lug to match the cast left lug...\r\n\r\nThe bolt head slides through an internal reinforcing ring, like a ''98 Mauser, sort of. Any extra strength couldn''t hurt.\r\n\r\nThere''s a big socket cast onto the back of the action, hanging down underneath at an angle, for mounting the stock. There''s very little metal on the right side, no fillets or radii to prevent cracks... all the recoil goes through this offset joint. The lug under the barrel is just for mounting the forward wood.\r\n\r\nThree 1/16" or so holes are drilled in the sidewall on the left side of the breech, approximately alongside the rim of a chambered cartridge. This makes a small slot, presumably to give gas from a ruptured case another escape path. The shape and position of the slot looks like another "don''t do this" directly in the left-side load path.\r\n\r\n("but it works", I keep repeating to myself...)\r\n\r\n\r\nA strange thing is, if you put a .580" hole through a piece of 1-1/4" round bar, counterbored the end and cut threads with a boring bar or big tap, you could finish the rest of the machining on a mini-mill and have a tube receiver that would accept an Enfield barrel and bolt. Opening it up for the Enfield double-stack magazine would sacrifice a lot of metal... of course, you could start with a square bar.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to build your own receiver, basing something off the SMLE would be WAY easier than trying to cut conventional raceways, though maybe no easier than some of the fat-bolt designs.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n2-03-2009, 07:52 AM #22\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nSoo... I gave the Lithgow to a friend, as reported earlier. Then a guy here on gunco made me "an offer I couldn''t refuse" on a Longbranch barreled action. And I found that Sarco has Navy Arms .45-70 Enfield barrels for $85, and... a quick phone call, and one is on the way.\r\n\r\nApparently (possibly?) Navy Arms used both No1 and No4 actions; different reviews said No1 and No4, anyway. Some other sources claim the tenon threads are different, some say all SMLE threads are the same... looks like I''ll find out for sure soon.\r\n\r\nLooks like two switchbarrel Enfields will be built in parallel. I have a spare barrel, so it looks like I''ll be starting with .303 Epps (basically .303 Ackley Improved; I can rent the reamer for $35), 7.62x54R, and .45-70. Bob wants .410, .45-70, and 7.52x54R to start with, though I''ll lean on him to pick up a spare barrel so I can chamber it for Epps while I have the reamer here.\r\n\r\nI keep looking at the Beowulf reamer sitting by the keyboard, but that''s outside the safe range for an SMLE action. On the other hand, .50-110 would be doable...\r\n\r\nThe Enfield''s unusual flat bolt face and generous extractor travel means it will feed various different rims without need for modification. I''ve even found a few reports of people who converted their SMLEs to 7mm Mauser, and there''s a company out there right now doing conversions to 7.62x39.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n12-04-2009, 07:12 AM #24\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nThe benchrest guys seem to go with a strap wrench to remove and replace the barrels. That''s what I''m planning to do. The old leverguns and Arisakas used various cams or levers to keep the barrels from wiggling around in short or interrupted threads.\r\n\r\n.45-70 brass has gone up a lot. Believe it or not, it''s more expensive than .50 Beowulf! But you can actually buy .45-70, and I''ve been back-ordered on Beowulf for nine months now...\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of ways to go about headspacing. The one I''m planning to do is cut the barrel back a bit so I can use a thick washer between the barrel and breech. Cut the barrel back some random distance, screw it in until it is against the no-go guage, back it off a hair, measure, and then face off the washer to the correct thickness. It would be hard to hide the washer, so I''ll probably make it out of stainless steel or something and make it stand out.\r\n\r\nUsing a washer would also let me correct for thread wear, should any occur. Just make new washers as needed. Thread wear is not supposed to be an issue according to the benchrest guys, though.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n12-10-2009, 01:26 PM #28\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nThe bad thing about forums is, I get involved with a thread one day, then forget where it was a few days later. Somewhere in the multiverse I was following a thread about rebarreling Enfields, and someone said Sarco had Navy Arms .45-70 barrels for $85. I checked Sarco''s web site and couldn''t find them, so I called. The guy had to go look for them, but yeah, they had them. Navy / Gibbs / Parker made a couple of runs of SMLEs in .45-70 a few years ago. You can find the 3-shot magazines for the outrageous price of $75 in various places, but this was the barrel, "chambered and threaded", 22" long. Hell, yes!\r\n\r\nIt came in today. It''s 1.1" at the breech for 5", steps abruptly down to 1", and a straight taper to 3/4" at the muzzle. I didn''t even notice the taper at first; my first thought was "bull barrel?" The .458 hole is impressively large. There is no extractor cut and no index mark, which is fine. It won''t screw into the No.1 receiver I have handy, but the starting thread on the barrel looks munged, like it was dropped. I''ll hit it with the thread file and try again. The receiver I got from Longbranch is primo, but I haven''t removed the barrel yet.\r\n\r\nThis barrel is brand new, but it''s from Sarco. The bore is nice and bright, but the outside had been pretty rusty. Looks like someone put it on a lathe and tried to sandpaper the rust off, but there are still pits and blotches. I was planning to Parkerize the receiver and all the barrels so everything would match, so no big deal, but if someone wanted to blue a barrel, it''d be worth telling the salesman explicitly that you wanted a nice one. Still, for $85, ($96 to my door) I''m not complaining.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n01-29-2010, 07:17 AM #29\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nOkay, a member on another forum was kind enough to let me borrow his Gibbs Frontier for a while. It was a Lithgow Mk1 virtually identical to one of the receivers I have, which made the comparison much easier than it might otherwise have been. \r\n\r\nBasically, the magic is in the magazine. \r\n\r\nThe Gibbs magazine has very short lips on the top. It''s also single stack. The magazine presents the rim of the cartridge to the "thumbnail" cutouts on the underside of the receiver. These grab the rim and force the whole cartridge up into line with the breech as it moves forward for the first half inch or so. \r\n\r\nIt sounds complex, but if you look at an SMLE from the magazine well opening you can see how it works. \r\n\r\nWhere I was getting fixated was, all of the rifles and pistols I''ve dealt with before stripped their cartridges straight out of the magazine, which was sometimes notched for bolt clearance, or the cartridges slipped off the magazine at an angle, with the nose entering the breech and the base being levered up as the cartridge went in. I thought the Enfield did that, too. Of course I have a receiver, barrel, and bolt so far, with no magazine yet... \r\n\r\nThe .45-70 still won''t fit into the .45-70 barrel screwed into the Enfield receiver; the rim wedges into the rails about 3/4 inch from the breech ring. It looks like the Gibbs people used a Dremel with a 1/2" sanding drum and reached in and took off .010 to .015" of the sharp corners at the bottom, not much more than just rounding the corners off. That''s all it takes for the cartridge to slide forward. \r\n\r\nThere''s a bulkhead in the receiver ring; the rim must pass through, and it''s too big. Gibbs probably used a lathe to open it up. I thought the rifle''s owner might not appreciate wrench marks, so I didn''t pull the barrel for a look. Opening up the ring would be simple enough with a grinder if you didn''t have a lathe; it''s just clearance for the rim. \r\n\r\nThat''s it for the receiver mods! \r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the magic is in the magazine. The magic consists of the short feed lips, which are 1-1/16" long, with the front edges cut back about 45 degrees. \r\n\r\nThe lips are so short that if you hold the magazine upside down, a cartridge will hang down at a 45 degree angle. The lips just hold the rim for long enough to get it started into the "fingernail mark" guide cuts in the receiver. \r\n\r\nIt''s a single-stack magazine. There''s a rib stamped into the front that guides the front of the cartridge. In back, they spot welded some L-shaped pieces of sheet metal. These are way back and close to the cartridge, and keep the rims lined up neatly. The rims can''t pass forward and let the cartridges slam back and forth in the magazine, and they hold them in position to present to the fingernail marks. If the cartridge slid forward in the magazine when the bolt picked up the rim, it''d jam in the receiver rails. \r\n\r\nI don''t see any particular reason you couldn''t modify a standard SMLE magazine to work the same way. \r\n\r\nThe magazine holds three rounds. As advertised, you can put four in there, but you get a big wedgie when you try to work the bolt. Five cartridges will fit, same problem. \r\n\r\nI played with this for a couple of hours. My best guess is that A) the magazine spring is too weak and B) the follower gets tilted as the cartridges feed, letting things wedge up. I think it should be possible to tweak the magazine to feed four or five cartridges reliably, and I don''t see any big reason they can''t be double-stacked like the standard Enfield layout. \r\n\r\nWhat it looks like is, Gibbs allocated a certain amount of time or money to the magazine work, then ran out of time (or money) and said, "to heck with it, just tell them not to put more than three in there." \r\n\r\n\r\nWorking the bolt took a bit of authority. The blunt front of the .45-70 bumps against inside bits the pointy .303 slides right past. After an evening''s experimentation, I had a bunch of .45-70s with noticeably battered noses. You don''t have to be abusive, but if you try to flick the bolt back and forth like you can with a .303, it''s likely the cartridge will get a wedgie and you''ll have to either force it or open the bolt and straighten it out. \r\n\r\nIt looks like you could safely grind clearances into the receiver to fix this. I''m guessing Gibbs didn''t do it due to expense - it worked, and it was in inexpensive hunting rifle on a war-surplus action, what do you want for $299? \r\n\r\nThat would also explain the ejection problem. The Gibbs flings empty brass just fine. Trying to clear a loaded round will usually give you another wedgie. \r\n\r\nIf you look at an Enfield receiver ring, you''ll see a notch up at the right side front just about the side to hold a pencil. The notch is to clear the point of a .303 bullet. The ,45-70 bullet is much bigger, and the notch needs to be bigger too. Again, opening it up should be safe and simple. \r\n\r\nYou might wonder why the cartridge wouldn''t eject properly when it''s short enough to slide entirely back from the breech. The cutout shouldn''t be necessary. The reason is the rim gets caught on some of the edges near the back, and it gets stuck. A tiny amount of grinding or polishing might well fix the problem; it might be preferable to clearancing the ring. \r\n\r\nI wound up clearing loaded rounds by dropping the magazine, opening the bolt, and letting the chambered round drop out. \r\n\r\nNow, we''re talking about very small amounts of interference here; with normal production tolerances, it''s likely that not all the Gibbs guns do this. It''s a bit quirky, but again, how much custom gunsmithing do you expect for the price? \r\n\r\nFrankly, I don''t see how they could justify the blueing job, which (in my opinion) was freakin'' gorgeous. They''d done some polishing on the surplus bits, and the barrel was slick. I''m used to phosphated military stuff, and I felt like a vandal every time I put a greasy fingerprint on the Gibbs. \r\n\r\nThe bolt is a matte silver color; various articles say it''s chromed, and it does indeed look like industrial matte chrome. The fit is snug and the movement is smooth. I''ll probably send mine off somewhere to have it done; the couple of thousandths of plating really snugs up the fit.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n12-21-2010, 11:55 PM #48\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nnet.lore says you can just run a 54R reamer into a .303 barrel, though it''ll result in a funny-looking stepped case after firing. Lore also says if you set the barrel back a couple of threads you can fix this.\r\n\r\nAin''t no way, droogies. Two threads isn''t *nearly* enough to make a clean chamber, which I should have realized from looking at the drawings.\r\n\r\nThe SMLE doesn''t have many threads to begin with, so setting it back more than two threads would start getting iffy. There''s also the problem that on the No.1, you''re moving the barrel far enough that all the "stuff" on the forend might not line up any more.\r\n\r\nSo, if all you want is something that''ll shoot, just run the 54R reamer in. But there''s no way to cut a correct chamber into the factory .303 barrel without shortening it too much to use.\r\n\r\nThe Mosin barrel has a finer thread than the SMLE barrel, too. I was hoping I might be able to step it on the lathe to take some of the SMLE hardware, but no go.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n12-22-2010, 12:26 PM #50\r\nTRX \r\n\r\nYou''d have maybe four threads left by the time you set the barrel back enough to completely clean it up. It''s probably enough, but frankly, if I was going to use the original barrel, I''d just run the 54R reamer in there and call it good enough. Baud knows the .303 chambers are loose enough to start with; the extra neck that would be fireformed onto the 54R case would be no big deal. If you were shooting commercial Boxer-primed brass and reloading it, it would be one thing, but the whole point of converting an Enfield to 54R is to shoot cheap Berdan primed Commie ammo. As long as headspace is correct and the case doesn''t actually rupture, who cares what it looks like when you eject it?\r\n\r\nI guess I was just annoyed that "just set the barrel back a couple of threads and it''ll fix it right up" turned out to be more Bubba Gunsmith lore. And if I''d taken the time to examine the case drawings in the loading manual, I wouldn''t have been suckered.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n06-12-2011, 09:04 AM #51\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nThe SMLE doesn''t have a straight hole back from the barrel to the bolt. It has a smaller-diameter web the bolt head pokes into, sort of like the "extra web" on a 98 Mauser.\r\n\r\nThe .45-70 rim is too big to go through the hole. It''s not critical, and could probably be opened up with a Dremel, but in the interests of overkill I made a fixture to hold the receiver on the lathe. I need to make a stepped bushing to press into the front for the steady rest to ride.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n07-03-2012, 08:53 PM #59\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nThe buttstock and forend showed up last week. There''s no hardware with either, no big deal. I think I''m going to go with a rubber butt pad on the buttstock since I don''t have a proper metal buttplate for it, and frankly, in my advancing years my shoulder is getting tender.\r\n\r\nI still don''t know what the difference between a No.1 and No.4 buttstock is; I can''t tell them apart by eye, and a No.1 will hammer into the No.4 receiver.\r\n\r\nThe forends are *much* different. The No.4 receiver is much more squared off, and the recoil lug is different. Looking at the impressions, I was struck once again by now few places the action and forend touch. Of course, the socketed buttstock takes all the recoil, and the forend just provides a place to hang on to. Just another example of James Paris Lee''s brilliant engineering.\r\n\r\nA *lot* of wood has to come out of the forend for the pipe-ular .45-70 barrel to snuggle in. What I need is a big half-round rasp with the right radius and an offset handle. So far I haven''t found exactly what I''m thinking about at Brownells or any woodworking site. The other thing would be a round scraper. I''m thinking of a beveled disc of the right diameter, mounted on a handle. I think I saw something like that somewhere, but it would be easy enough to make.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way I have to decide what I''m going to do for the front sight. The No.4 has an excellent peep sight on the receiver already.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way the Voices have persuaded me to load the .45-70 cases with black powder. The ball mill is about half finished. The Voices have been suggesting that a nice muzzle brake would make the SMLE a true "smelly" if I wanted to be obnoxious to any hip-hop assault rifle yuppies at the range...\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n10-31-2012, 07:21 PM #65\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nThe SMLE extractor has a very long stroke; up in Canada people have done 7mm Mauser conversions and claim the unmodified extractor works find with the rimless case.\r\n\r\nThe extractor is *supposed* to be able to push the case to the left. That preloads the case against the left side of the chamber for consistency, sort of like a the ejector pin on an AR or a Savage. And it keeps the case pushed to the left side of the receiver, so it will slide across the bolt face a bit as the bolt strokes back, so it can hit the ejector screw.\r\n\r\nThe left sidewall is actually scooped out a bit to let the case slide over; that''s one reason the bolt feels loosey-goosey.\r\n\r\nHow''s your headspace? You might be able to take a little off the bolt head face to get more extractor bite.\r\n\r\nI never did get any feedback on the varying rim thicknesses of .45-70 brass on any of the boards where I asked, and the only local place that had used brass went out of business. \r\n\r\nI''m tempted to set my rifle up tight on an .062" rim, and face off the front of any thick rims on the lathe to .062". Just reaching in with a parting tool should do it. You can''t take of off the back of the case without making the primer pocket shallower.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I''ll probably just "adjust" forty or sixty cases, which will probably last me the rest of my life... I''m not worried if it won''t handle all commercial ammunition. Though, really, the change in headspace doesn''t seem to be an issue with .45-70 guns in general, and if there''s any platform that has proven it can handle excessive headspace, it''s the SMLE!\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n05-16-2014, 07:06 AM #68\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\n"Real Life" and Quality Shop Time are still in conflict, but I did make a small step forward this morning. \r\n\r\nI''d been gagging at the price of surplus Gibbs magazines (close to $100), particularly since they don''t work very well. Then I noticed that OWS didn''t have them listed any more. Well, I didn''t really want one anyway, but it was nice knowing there was a fallback option.\r\n\r\nThere''s a guy on Gunbroker who has been trying to sell an old Lee magazine for... years, I guess, at $125. I finally said "screw it!" and bought the thing.\r\n\r\nThe magazine is from an 1885 Remington-Lee in .45-70. It''s narrower and shorter than an SMLE magazine; I''ll have to make an adapter of some sort to hold it. But it''s designed from the ground up to feed .45-70.\r\n\r\nJames Paris Lee sold several designs to Remington before he hooked up with Enfield. There were several Remington-Lee rifles. The early ones had smooth-sided magazines, the 1885 had an elaborate set of stepped guide ridges stamped into the sides, and the 1899 had a simpler set of guide ridges. The one I bought is an 1885. The ridges look like they''ll guide the base of the cartridge right up the bolt face. \r\n\r\nSo I have a 70 year old receiver, a 129 year old magazine, and I''ll be shooting reproductions of a 142 year old cartridge. Life is good...\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n05-21-2014, 12:51 PM #73\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nThis morning''s mail delivery brought twa''s package. I immediately ripped it open and stuffed the mag full of new Remington .45-70s. Oooh, perfect! The lips of the magazine hold the cartridge nearly horizontal instead of letting them flip up at over 45 degrees like the Gibbs magazines, and they slide cleanly out and forward. And it holds five, instead of four like the Gibbs.\r\n\r\nThanks, Les! \r\n\r\nThe magazine is both narrower and shorter front-to-back than an SMLE mag, so there''s room for an adapter plate or adjustment of position. The latch bits aren''t anywhere near the SMLE positions, though they look similar. I''ll probably modify the rifle''s mag latch and leave the magazine unmolested.\r\n\r\nI may wind up with the only .45-70 SMLE that will hold a full five rounds of .45-70!\r\n\r\n===============\r\n    \r\n05-21-2014, 08:30 PM #74\r\nTRX  \r\n\r\nWHOA! I got home tonight and had a bit more time to play with the magazine. It DOES snick into place with the Enfield magazine catch. And, with just that, no trigger guard metal, and the front of the magazine touching the front of the receiver, there''s a smooth ramp out of the magazine and into the chamber.\r\n\r\nThe bolt slides the cartridge forward, the nose lifts up into the chamber while the rim is still guided by the mag lips, once the first 3/4" or so of the cartridge is in the chamber, the back is guided up from the lips by the stamped-in side ramps, and the now-level cartridge slides straight into the chamber.\r\n\r\nExcuse me, I feel a big "yee-HAW" coming on right now...\r\n\r\nI knew it could be made to work; I wasn''t expecting all it would need is a little filler in the magwell to keep it from rattling around...\r\n\r\n[doing the happy dance]', ''),

(606030, 'Taurus PT92 Magazine is just Wonderful &amp; Very Reliable !!! Few months back there was an issue raised on the forum by a gentleman about whether to keep the magazine of semiauto loaded or not, due to continous pressure of ammo on spring and the spring might not be able to feed properly later, if kept loaded for long.\n\nAn idea came to my mind to load one magazine of my Taurus PT92 AFS ( same pistol on which this thread was started ) and keep it loaded for an extended period of time and then check out any wear and tear effect.\n\nI never conducted the test on the two original mags which came alongwith the weapon. Actually it you see the intial part of thread I purchased 4 extra genuine Taurus mags from Orient Traders because at that time they were available.\n\nThis is the picture of mag, with date written on pasted red tape at the base of magazine.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]30948[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30950[/ATTACH]\n\nAnd today I reached LRC with the same magzine and others as well. Mag was loaded on 17.11.2013 with 15 rounds of S&B, although capacity was 17 and I tried my best to load it to maximum but magazine was brand new and I was hardly able to put 15 in.\n\nThough ammo was pretty much showing the effect of time.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]30951[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30952[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]30953[/ATTACH]\n\n\nFired it and magazine worked flawless it fired all rounds without any hiccup then I again loaded the same mag with chinese ammo, Hollow Points, Russian ammo. Atleast 60 rounds of different brands and different categories and even mixed were fired after the initial 15 old loaded rounds of S&B. Making it a total of 75 rounds fired from this magazine without any FTF, FTFeed, FTE etc. It went smooth.\n\nSo, Gentlemen it is just a Myth that loaded magazine will wear off with time not only here but on net people keep on arguing this issue ( just like 9mm vs .45 ).\n\nI have conducted the test myself & now I am sure atleast about my Taurus PT92 AFS 9mm Magazines that they are equally good and best part "Reliable" as the weapon itself is.\n\nSo, any Pistol with brand good than Taurus their Mags will definitely be better.

Although you can kill someone with a poisoned dart, it will take at least 30 mins to do that. And in case that "someone" happens to be carrying even a spiked club or a thick rod ...\n\nOr you can kill/disable them quickly enough too. But for that, you will need 50 blowgunners shooting at the target relentlessly until they raise their arms and drop down in submission.

I have 45k with me. So I am now on my mission to save up 55 more and then I would get the Hatsan pcp [I]WITH [/I]the charging pump. I know I have to get it sooner or later, so if I waste money on a 125 or something now, it will only get harder for me to get a pcp later.\n\nSo well :S This season too, it appears like I will be airgun-less.

(606221, ' Two handed 25" inches sword should have a grip length of [I]at least [/I]6 inches. But for beauty reasons you might want to extent it to 8. Just remember that grip length has a major impact on the center of mass of the sword which would affect its ease of use. Some people prefer a sword which has a center of mass 2/3 way towards the blade (I and all other Indian swordplay practitioners like that) while the Japanese ones have their center of mass at lesser distance from the grip. Thing is, the lighter the grip is, the easier the sword use would be (but then again, I am talking about single handed swords). I [I][B]think [/B][/I]you guys would feel easy with swords which have a center of mass nearly at the center of blade.\n\nIf you don''t strike your sword on hard objects (like dry wood, cement, adobe walls and such), it would retain its sharpness for a long time. Usually, using swords for what they are built for (slicing flesh), a single sharpening goes 6 months or so, after which you should get it sharpened it again. The issue with 100% slick and razor sharp sword is that you cannot use it for fun stuff, like striking on adobe walls and wood. Also know that you can always get a blunt sword sharpened.\n\nI suggest that you instruct the dude to leave the grip without ANY wrapping or whatever, and apply the finish yourself. You can create a far better and more beautiful grip finish yourself.\n\nMake sure to mention that you fellows belong to pakguns forums (so that any other fellow members who place an order are treated seriously).

The difference is   not easily visible. Only if you look at the blade line carefully, you   can notice it. Or if you hold the sword and carefully rotate it in your   hand, feeling it''s weight orientation, you would notice that the  weight  slightly "pulls" to one side. This issue was more obvious when  the  sword came first. I reported it to the dude (and didn''t mention it  here,  because I didn''t want to degrade them, because a bad alignment is  a  considered a blunder with swords/knives). He said that I was right  and  apologized for it and tried to fix it. However, according to him,  the  issue could be resolved completely only if the blade was pulled off  the  grip and was worked on, again. He said that this was not possible  now  that the blade had been tightly sealed to the grip :(   Anyhow, now the alignment issue is reduced to very minor scale and   other than giving me a sense of incompleteness and imperfection, it has   no other implications.[/QUOTE]', ''),

It is very much possible that the blade be straight and aligned with the grip, yet the weight of the sword be biased to one side, instead of being distributed homogeneously.

What was your IQ ranking the last time you took the test? :mad2: :mad2: :mad2:\n\nWere you not paying attention [B]again?[/B]\n\n[QUOTE=Sand in topic Knives (repeat)][B]ALIGNMENT[/B]\n\nThere is a slight alignment issue with the blade which means that the    blade and the grip/handle are not in a straight line. The difference is    not easily visible. Only if you look at the blade line carefully, you    can notice it. Or [B][I]if you hold the sword and carefully rotate it in  your   hand, feeling it''s weight orientation, you would notice that the   weight  slightly "pulls" to one side.[/I][/B] This issue was more obvious when   the  sword came first. I reported it to the dude (and didn''t mention it   here,  because I didn''t want to degrade them, because a bad alignment  is  a  considered a blunder with swords/knives). He said that I was  right  and  apologized for it and tried to fix it. [I][B]However, according to  him,  the  issue could be resolved completely only if the blade was  pulled off  the  grip and was worked on, again. He said that this was  not possible  now  that the blade had been tightly sealed to the grip[/B][/I] :(    Anyhow, now the alignment issue is reduced to very minor scale and    other than giving me a sense of incompleteness and imperfection, it has    no other implications.[/QUOTE]\n\nNow comes the second part. If the weight disorientation is large, you would feel it immediately when you hold the sword in your hand (now kid, I said [B][I]hand[/I][/B], not hands. stay awake). It would feel as if there is "something wrong" with the sword. As in, you will feel that the sword is heavier at one side (side as in left and right sides, not front or back, which is a matter of center of mass location).\n\nIf the disorientation is relatively lesser, you would feel it only while using (striking, swinging, practicing) the sword and not while you hold it static in your hand.\n\nIf it is at very minute level (and it will always be there at these levels if you get a sword built from someone with skill any lesser than Hattori Hanzo of Kill Bill), you will develop an understanding of it only after a long time of usage. But at such minute levels, it actually gives your blade a sense of individuality, something which isn''t right, but which you have started to enjoy. That comes a long time after using that sword though.\n\nSigh! Kids these days ... Can''t even take a spoon feeding properly ...!', ''),

The Classic has no checkering,  a straight forend and no butt-plate ventilation but offers fibre-optic  sights.\n The Premium has a beechwood stock and black T06 metal trigger, while  the top-of-the-range Luxus boasts a fancy walnut stock, diamond  checkering on the forend and pistol grip, ventilated rubber pad,  polished deep-black metal surface, metal sights with interchangeable  front sights and an 18k gold-plated T06 metal trigger.\n A Diana spokesman explained: &#8220;With the new N-TEC piston you get the  ability to take more shots with consistent power and better accuracy,  enjoying smoother and lighter cocking effort &#8211; just a smooth operator.\n &#8220;The attractive, modern and ergonomic-designed wooden stock is an  absolute eye-catcher and makes this rifle a &#8216;must-have&#8217; hunting and  sporting gun.&#8221;', ''),

I want a quality .223 Rifle but when the prices will be down to Normal and it may take an year or even more should I go for grace period or get a number of weapon entered on License, both are risky what should I do.

Other than one person''s [B]BOGUS[/B] claim of Canik becoming loose in tolerances hence loosing accuracy (person who has never fired a Canik in his life), no one has been able to put forward anything credible that suggests Canik alloy pistols being inferior in quality and not worth.\n\nI''m giving my personal conclusion below and then bow out of this.\n\nCZ make good pistols.\nCanik make good pistols (except their polymer model TP9).\nCZ are less refined in finishing and due to a much larger scale production have and have had QC issues as expected from large manufacturers. \nBoth CZ models and their counterparts from Canik are equally accurate (having fired both).\n\n[B]For a [U]financially astute gunner[/U] who wants a reliable 9mm for SD/HD that is very well made, low maintenance, makes for a very good range pistol (lighter in weight too), eats up cheaper Chinese and POF ammo without any pistol related issues, and is real value for money in PK market, Canik would my recommendation any given day. \n\nFor a full size 9mm pistol, spend 65-70k on a Canik and buy 1000 rounds of POF for another 35k, and that would cost one less than one SP01/75B on it''s own without ammo, and enjoyment factor will be same.[/B]\n\nFor those who want the brand tag, and collectors/shopoholics (lolz, even those buy 1911 copy by a similar Turkish company as Canik for ''mere'' 80k and sing praises of quality and accuracy) then Canik is not for you. Surely, they''ll buy a Piranha also for collection. That is the reality.\n\nAs I''ve said plenty of times before, if Piranha F or Shark F only had tritium sites I wouldn''t have bothered with a CZ.\n\nAs the challenge has been set by Moeen bhai, members are welcome to bring new shooters to target fire at plates with my SP01 and new Piranha. I''m willing to buy a Canik C100 for the same excercise if a CZ fan/Canik basher coughs up a CZ P01.', ''),

When the made Glock series in late 1990s there where many many  reports of negligence discharge coz of very soft trigger coz people were  used to with heavy revolver triggers.so Smith and wesson put a heavy  trigger coz they wanted people not to get harmed by there own  hands(People did that alot) after reports glock put a trigger mod called  (New york trigger) i don''t know is there any info about it on internet  or not but that happened afterward and that trigger is 7-8lbs. \nLets come to the point why someone buy a sigma instead of Glock 19 in Pakistan.\n1. Glock cost 300K-425K avg. where sigma cost me 105K so its a dirt cheap infront of glock 19.\n2.  Sigma have better grip(i personally got bitten by a Glock 17 LOL)  better ejection, better mag release and slid lock it has a fully  supported chamber which is safe.\n3.Maintenance of sigma is very cheap and easy then glock.\n4.it  has a bit heavy trigger which is better for deep conceal and carry thing  and at home where you have your guns under the pillow and children  around.\n5.Sigma have +1 bullet count what counts alot when you are in a life and death situation (my personal opinion)\n\nnow  the fun part i literally hit my sigma on a brick wall when cocked and  chambered LOL didn''t charged i dropped it from a helicopter height was  100 meters didn''t fired i dropped it on a marble floor load didn''t  charged. Glock charged in first 2 situations.\nlast point you made  brother its a point for a person who shoots 10-30 rounds a month or 2.  Sigma shoots very accurately even my 12 years old nephew shoot it very  easily and accurately from 50 yrds where he complained about Glock 19  the he is not able to grip it better and its a open truth you have get  used with glock grip its very angular.\nSmooth trigger counts alot but  not that much so you can spend 300K instead of 100K for 95% same gun  and better in operation too. buy it for less mod it and make it better  or shoot it more and get used to. i didn''t mod my sigma just shoot it  more and more.', ''),

When the made Glock series in late 1990s there where many many  reports of negligence discharge coz of very soft trigger coz people were  used to with heavy revolver triggers.so Smith and wesson put a heavy  trigger coz they wanted people not to get harmed by there own  hands(People did that alot) after reports glock put a trigger mod called  (New york trigger) i don''t know is there any info about it on internet  or not but that happened afterward and that trigger is 7-8lbs. \r\nLets come to the point why someone buy a sigma instead of Glock 19 in Pakistan.\r\n1. Glock cost 300K-425K avg. where sigma cost me 105K so its a dirt cheap infront of glock 19.\r\n2.  Sigma have better grip(i personally got bitten by a Glock 17 LOL)  better ejection, better mag release and slid lock it has a fully  supported chamber which is safe.\r\n3.Maintenance of sigma is very cheap and easy then glock.\r\n4.it  has a bit heavy trigger which is better for deep conceal and carry thing  and at home where you have your guns under the pillow and children  around.\r\n5.Sigma have +1 bullet count what counts alot when you are in a life and death situation (my personal opinion)\r\n\r\nnow  the fun part i literally hit my sigma on a brick wall when cocked and  chambered LOL didn''t charged i dropped it from a helicopter height was  100 meters didn''t fired i dropped it on a marble floor load didn''t  charged.

[B]Remember Any gun can do Malfunction anytime so you have to be prepare to face it and clear it as fast as you can.[/B]\n\n[B]Malfunction Level 1[/B]\n\n[B]Failure to fire (FTF misfire, Dud):[/B]\n                                  Sometimes you have very reliable gun in you hand and it misfires its nothing on range but very dangerous in a firefight.\n[B]common causes of this malfunction are:[/B]\n\n1. Low primer strike 2. hard primer of the bullet 3. small firing pin 4.Lose Mag. 5. bigger space b/t Chamber and firing pin.\n\n[B]How to clear this malfunction:[/B]\n                                            The method is called "Tap ,rack ,Shoot" when you face it do not lose you sight and aim don''t look at your gun be in your senses and focus on your target.\nfirst of all leave your ground left or right or get down on your knee. Tap the magazine with your palm rack the slide (reload) Aim and shoot.\nafter clearing every cause if you are facing the #5 you have to change the weapon or get a replacement.\nNote Dud rounds can still be dangerous and should be deactivated and disposed of properly.\n\n[B]Malfunction Level 2[/B]\n\n[B]Failure to Eject (stovepipe or FTE)[/B]\n\n[B]Common Cause of this malfunction[/B].\n1. expanded bras cap(Khokha ,Khol) 2. Faulty Ejector 3. expended chamber coz of heat 4. Low power bullet powder\n\n[B]How to clear this malfunction:[/B]\nSame technique will be use in this malfunction too. Leave your ground left or right or get down on your knee. Tap the magazine with your palm rack the slide (reload) Aim and shoot.\n\n[B]Malfunction Level 3:[/B]\n\n[B]Double feed[/B](one bullet in chamber and one half out of magazine and behind it)\n\nThis is most hard to clear and time taking Malfunction.If you are in home defense situation or in a open area fire fight this can cause a serious life threatening damage if not handled properly.\n\n[B]Common causes of this malfunction:[/B]\n\n1. open face of Magazine 2. Lower Slide then standard . 3 big feeder then standard 4.expanded chamber cause of heat.\n\n[B]How to clear this malfunction[/B]:\nFirst of all you have to know that double feed happened. when your gun do a Level 3 malfunction slider will lock at rare because second bullet will block it.\n Be in your senses and[B] run for nearest "Cover"[/B] do not stay at you ground and start clearing.\n[B]step 1[/B]: Pull the magazine out .normally mag release don''t work in this situation pull it hard from the bottom plate. watch your hands because when you pull out the mag slide will go forward automatically\n[B]step 2[/B]: rake the slide so it ejects the round in the chamber Rake rake rake.\n[B]Step 3[/B]: Put the magazine back in load aim shoot.\n\n[B]Malfunction Level 4[/B]\n\n[B]Failuer to feed (Misfeed)[/B]\n                                          Its a very common malfuctions in that your gun fires normal but after fire there is just a firing pin release no discharge(no fire).\n\n[B]Common causes of this Malfuction:[/B]\n1.Fauty magazine face 2. Lose Magazine spring 3. Small rubbed or damaged feeder on Slide 4.Low quality after market magazine\n5.substandard or damage brac cap back.\n\n[B]How to Clear this malfunction:[/B]\n                                            There will be the same method to clear as level one and leve two malfunctions but with slight change.Leave your ground left or right or get down on your knee. Tap the magazine with your palm rack the slide (reload) Aim and shoot.if this method don''t work pull the mag out rack silde 3 times pull the top bullet out of mag put mag back in tap hard rake aim shoot. \nif the malfunction remain the same change the mage change ammo if still the same then examin your guns slide''s feeder area.\n\n\n[B]Other common Malfunctions:[/B]\n\n[B]Slam fire:\n               [/B]  A slamfire is a premature, unintended discharge of a firearm that occurs as a round is being loaded into the chamber. This is very common malfunction in striker fired handguns if you are facing change your trigger springs if problem remains check and change firing pin locker.\n\n[B]squib load[/B]:\nA squib load (also squib round, squib, squib fire, insufficient discharge, incomplete discharge) is an extremely dangerous malfunction that happens when a fired projectile does not carry enough force and becomes stuck in the gun barrel instead of exiting it. In the case of semi-automatic or automatic weapons, this can cause successive rounds to be fired into the projectile obstructing the barrel, which can cause catastrophic failure to the structural integrity of the firearm, and pose a threat to the operator or bystanders. The bullet from a squib stuck in the barrel can be ejected when subsequently firing a blank round, causing the gun to discharge a bullet when not expected. Furthermore, blank rounds use a type of powder different from that of other rounds, and generate much more pressure. Therefore, the presence of a bullet or other obstruction in the barrel may cause the firearm to explode.\n[B]\nCase head separation:[/B]\nCase head separation occurs when the walls of the casing become thin or  fatigued. Upon firing the round, the case separates into two pieces near  the head. It is not uncommon with brass that has been reloaded several times.\n\nSome mechanical malfunctions are caused by poor design and cannot easily  be avoided. Some malfunctions with cartridges can be attributed to poor  quality or damaged (improper storage, moisture) ammunition. Many  malfunctions can be prevented by properly practicing firearm cleaning  and maintenance on a regular basis.\n[B]\nVery Important Note:[/B] if you are owning a partially supported chamber gun like Glocks or any other one do not use Cas bullets, and reloaded ammo. case head separation can cause a very serious and not life threatening but life taking mishap including whole gun blow up,chamber cracking, slide blow up. Please do not use reloaded ammo or desi ammo in partially supported chamber guns.\n\nI tried my best according to my knowledge but i''m a human so i can do mistakes i hope this will help others in this regard.', ''),

Now God knows how much successful I am.\n\nI have nothing like ego at all but after all I am a human being want to be treated just like people from other trades deal. Actually it is better to say PARA people really damaged my Self Respect. And Self Respect once lost or damaged is difficult to recover.\n\nBut you are absolutely right that there is no need of using bad words for people who even deserve it just dont go there anymore but I request everyone to put your especially negative feedback about dealers plz dont take it wrong it is not negative thinking it is just helping others avoid such dealers. \n\nAnd I may have gone too far because after all I am a human being with bad experience.

It should be compared with .357 sig (125 gr FMJ has velocity of 440 m/s).\n\n2. Due to Highy Velocity, it should not be used in HD / closed spaced because chances of ricochet are lot higher.\n\n3. It is lethal at medium range (for pistol / obviously range is subjective) as well (75 meters). Remember, the round was designed for SMG. On the other hand, 9mm and .45 acp will have lighter punch than .30\n\n4. Large Size??? Heavy Weight?? I think it is one of the lightest pistols (600 - 650 grams) and best concealable pistol.

It should be compared with .357 sig (125 gr FMJ has velocity of 440 m/s).\n\n2. Due to Highy Velocity, it should not be used in HD / closed spaced because chances of ricochet are lot higher.\n\n3. It is lethal at medium range (for pistol / obviously range is subjective) as well (75 meters). Remember, the round was designed for SMG. On the other hand, 9mm and .45 acp will have lighter punch than .30\n\n4. Large Size??? Heavy Weight?? I think it is one of the lightest pistols (600 - 650 grams) and best concealable pistol. The disadvantge could be that it cannot be cocked & locked or loaded.\n\n5. Agree that Bulleye shooting is difficult but in defensive situation, you don''t have time to take aim and shoot.

Ballistics differ in both designs even keeping the ammo same.\n\nSome seniors should plz guide us whether magazine of PM can be used safely in PMM ( Paranoid about Kaboom ). Because it makes sense other than grip, rest of the pistol is same even slides are interchageable.\n\nBrother what I saw In Nila Gumbad Market Basement from one shop of a Pathan, he told me it is darra/local made and asked about 1000 Rs. for it but he was pretty sure about it''s performance but I stopped trusting dealers anymore. Anyhow it will make no differece in spending 1K for a single magazine whether it works or not.\n\nIf if works fine and give no hiccups will purchase a couple of more and if Original Baikal Magazines of PM is available it will be available in Lahore as well. Need to go on Magazine hunt again.\n\nPersonally I think PM mags can be used in PMM without any trouble because in PMM there are both mag release buttons one on it''s normal place & other at the bottom just like PM version.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\nwell bro there is no problem in using the magazine of PM in PMM \njust yesterday i fired 8 rounds filled in PM magazine from PMM without any problem \nits totally safe i did it for the second time \nthe only change is that you cannot use the magazine release button of the PMM to eject the PM magazine for ejecting the PM magazine you have to use the catch at the base of the PMM mak which is the same as in PM mak', ''),

Chinese Red box if purchased more than 100 was no more than 38/pop and S&B was no more than 60/pop. They ripped me off a big time.\n\nI trusted them and never asked for bargain or low price as I am purchasing 300 bullets due to so called [COLOR=#ff0000][B]"GOOD REPUTATION" [/B][/COLOR]in this forum and particularly this thread. May be they are good to [B][COLOR=#ff0000]CERTAIN & SPECIFIC[/COLOR][/B] persons on Pakguns who are promoting them. \n\nWorst part is, their attitude is not like sitting to sale something. Went there for a couple of times previously with brand new licenses in my hand, intention was to buy a Taurus Revolver 608 as they have good variety of revolvers and a quality 9mm. 250K was in my pocket and they never took me even seriously although I gave reference of Pakguns and asked for particular weapons their prices and showed them the newly issued licenses so by no means I was just a window shopper.\n\nBut they were talking on Politics as they have to do a Public Defence of heir PhD Thesis in Political Science tomorrow infront of International Forum. So when I saw they are not interested at all I quietly left the shop and at the same day purchased 2 weapons and bullets plus small accessories and I think I spent about 242K that very day.\n\nAnd by the way bullets were sold by [B][COLOR=#ff0000]RESPECTED FOR SOME PG MEMBERS [/COLOR][/B]Major Sb.\n\n\nIf PARA is reading this post ( and I am sure they are reading it ) they should close their shop and start wiping off the windscreens of cars at signals because they do not worth more than that at all . I think they worth even worst than that.\n\nEven the dealer which is most Highlighted Majeed & Sons do atleast show interest or bargain if you present him fresh new genuine licenses and asking for some 200K+ shopping.\n\nPARA SUCKS & SUCKS BIG TIME\n\nAnd please do not become devil''s advocate they have no interest in business left and actually they have someother MORE PROFITABLE BUSSINESS and this shop is just a show off.

Not sure if they have the courage to try.. what if they will never belong.. He too was a guest and badly wanted to be accepted...\n\n but he obviously did not have the kind of weapons some of us have so he took a short cut. And thought that way he can become one of us..

I myself prefer .45 over 9mm and am more accurate with it on range.\n\nPoint is .45ACP is a Powerful round BUT not High Pressure round. When fired it creates a pressure of about 21000 psi which is low pressure compare it to 7.62X25mm which creates a pressure in 40000 psi and plus depending on the ammo.\n\nThe pistol which can handle .45 ACP can handle .30............. Sorry it is incorrect, here size does not matter, what matters is extremely High Pressure created by bottle neck 7.62X25mm so chances of Kaboom cannot be overlooked.\n\nAnother example is .40, it creates a chamber pressure of about 35000 psi and according to Firearm gurus on net, here I am quoting words of James Yeager that .40 sucks and no pistol Glock or any brand else has a barrel life of more than 10,000 even people do false claims that I have fired this much and that much rounds from my .40\n\n7.62X25 mm is obsolete in modern world and there must be a reason behind it.\n\nWith limited knowledge of firearms I may say 7.62X25 mm is best for conventional TT and if some new pistol is designed for it they have to make a perfect design for it to withstand 45000 psi pressure ( which by no means is meant for handguns ). Simply changing the barrel and keeping the rest especially including the slide same ...... Chances are good of KABOOM and can be a very disastrous one.\n\nIt was just my 2 cents, rest time will tell the truth. But the one courageous person who fires first 500 rounds should be wearing a bullet proof helmet and body armor and then pray everything goes fine.\n\nRegards', ''),

Chinese are well respected in metallurgy (NP44 1911A1 is in a class of it own with 5100 steel) so this could be a worthwhile purchase. There should be no doubt that PX3 was not designed for Pakistani market as just 600 imported (guessing the Sale price to be $300@, so total a measly $180,000) in this lot is a very very small number and Chinese simply don''t manufacture something brand new for anyone in small numbers (done deals with them and any custom designed product has to be a large quantity order), although it is highly likely that markings (such as ''30 Bore'') are done as per the importer''s requirements. There is a serious itch to buy one :)[/QUOTE]\n\nSir, it is available in Lahore at Orient Traders I have mentioned details in the other thread of same topic', ''),

Easy control, low recoil and small size are its pros, FTEs are cons... Army requires infantry weapons, if you have noticed or spoken to your army buddies you will find out that army during this operation has purchased the type 56-2 by the thousands and it is the most favoured weapon of all soldiers.

We used slugs. The slug were hitting on top RHS corner. The first correction was approx. 135mm vertical and 120 mm horizontal. The slug was zeroed to or satisfaction. However, then we fired Shaheen LG/SG which was coming down to approx. bottom RHS corner. This excercie was done A4 size target paper.  We then redid some shift of center of mass of LG/SG hit area, after several fires from myself, @Colt1911 and one of my non-PG friend.\n\n[U][B]Slug Testing @100m and 50m:[/B][/U]\nIn this test I did not made any adjustments or zeroing. The only compensation for distance was mostly judgement. \n[B]On 100m[/B], frankly it was very difficult to aim at 24" x 24", I mean great control was needed. I tried to aim vertical top end of slug tester i.e. approx. 12" above the center whereas you can see the exact location where I was able to hit.\n\n[B]On 50m[/B], I aimed at approx. top of A4 target i.e. approx. 6" above the center and you can see where I struck.\n\nI hope I am able to provide some insight on the overall process.

(607973, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;445795]Regardless of what the "official" website says, 7mmmag bro is right. In Canada, to travel with a firearm you just have to declare it and that''s pretty much it. Some airports even have a seperate check in line for gun owners (they''re separated in the cargo area). BUT, getting it INTO the destination country is a whole other matter. Crossing the US/CDA border is pretty straight forward, but that''s about as far as I''d go. Transporting a gun overseas to ANY country is a pretty gutsy proposition, as 7mmmag bro can now attest to :D[/QUOTE]\n\nSorry. I wasn''t aware of this.

(607975, ' I really think that Pakistan Government needs to revise the import policy of firearms for individuals.\n\n  Individuals should be allowed to import NPB firearms. Requirements should be set ie no prior criminal record, be a tax payer, number of firearms that can be imported in a year, age limit etc etc\n\nI think the current duty is 15%. The Government should raise it to 100% or even 150%. A 500 US dollar Glock will cost even with 150% duty about Rs 150,000. This will bring in much needed revenue to the Government.\n\nPersonally I am against firearms but the ground reality is that one can acquire much more lethal weapons easily in Pakistan.

Even I have written a detailed review of it in 9mm section.\nThis is how the hobby should be you enjoy best time, the time which you spend on Guns & Ammo and especially purchase of weapons.\n\nNow I want a change want to get quality Rifles but the only Rifle which one can get in Lahore at somewhat reasonable price is .22LR, so I purchased a Baikal MP 161 K Semiauto ( My prefered choice ) and I enjoyed it a lot with 3-9X50 ZOS Scope, was even able to take a white board marker at 50 yards and what a joy.\n\nNow problem is Shotguns are not allowed at LRC and obviously no rifle except .22LR allowed and even if suppose all caliber rifles were allowed at LRC I am unable to convince my mind to purchase bolt action, long range or .223 at insanely high prices.\n\n Licenses are no issue have plenty of them including one for .223. But the Rifle which I liked Colt madein USA .223 with high quality Leupold scope, asking price at Hira Arms was 12 Lacs. Better to add 4 more and get Honda City Prosmetic.\n\nSo, was feeling a little down better to say Hopeless as far as Rifles are concerned\n\nNow it is ok, you both are right enjoy the life with atleast dozen weapons one already have and always thank God for his Blessings (ofcourse keep on requesting God for more & more at the same time !!!!!!)\n\nStay happy & Have a Good Time\n\nRegards', ''),

Here everything happens and on record as well as off record HAPPENS. Just go to LRC ( Lahore Rifle Club ) and meet Mr. Younas Makkan, he will tell with real reference ( even if you are willing & just taking it as a Legend ) how many Kabooms hapenned in LRC alone, leave behind even the rest of Pakistan. You can make a List ( even shot but still a list not just a few names ) of Victims can personally meat them and Confirm the Kaboom, irrelevant of the fact whether they were using Darra made weapons, local reloaded cheap etc. take the Etiology out and you will be surprised by the facts and not fiction any way.\n\nCar accident is a total non comparable thing which people ( with due respect ) keep on giving and comparing with Guns. Well if you are doing it then please google also for the safest car to drive I dont which brand currently it is but Lincoln has won this award for many year i.e., chances of survival even after a fatal accident are less than driving obviously on Honda CD70 bike. \n\nCar accidents are UNAVOIDABLE in this modern world hard fact but have to swallow it vs Newly Chinese Discovered weapon and that too converted from one design to another in an obsolete cartridge ( atleast in the modern world ) creating 40000+ psi in chamber. \n\nPlz sir have a reality check on weapons they are never to be considered toys the factory / Company which is so called manufacturing this weapon PX-3 should have Factory tested the weapon from various angles and given a printed summary of it if not alongwith every weapon than atleast on their website. Nothing like that even exists.\n\nI am not against the weapons having a Dozen weapon licenses I am also a Gun Enthusiast & I even do not dislike or discourage the cheap weapons. I have them in my collection e.g., Chinese T T but sir it is not time but better to say "Generations Tested" weapon.\n\nSo, new and particularly not of good or any brand weapon should be tested but wearing enough protective measures or tested by a machine but unfortunately it can be done only in a Factory or a Company and not on any Range.\n\nMy concern is safety of my dear PG members & everyone who is not even reading this post.

(608691, ' There was a time when I wanted a bolt action in .223 and the 527 was among my top two (Mossberg MVP being the other). However I did not end up getting either. On the other hand, Ive always found milsurp stuff to be great value, and never had any problems with it. But with regards to its performance, it will depend on the particular gun, so you just have to try it. The dimension you want to play with that affects accuracy out of a rifle, is the bullet seating depth. Or the distance the bullet has to travel before it engages the rifling. Generally, the smaller that distance the better, but not actually touching. With manufacturing tolerances, that dimension varies from gun to gun. So milsurp ammo may shoot great out of one 527, but not another. If you don''t hand load your ammo, just try different brands, and different weights within different brands.

And, i wonder if that man would be willing to upload a video or a article on how he makes them. I understand the Japanese art of "folding" metal upon itself due to low yield ore,but today with somewhat better ore and equipment ( probably something like darra equipment for this particular maker ) i wonder how its made. I really don''t think he has a mini-furnace,capable of melting iron, to cast it and fold it traditional Japanese style,\nbut im inclined to think he hammer-forged it,as stated previously. This would also explain the minor balancing issue that plagued the first sword.\nIf anyone makes contact with E.T can they ask if he is willing to share his processes?[/QUOTE]\n\nI dun fink they make their swords with them hammers and nails. First ovv, you don'' get to cut a metal sheet in blade form with a hammer. You can''t use a metal cutter either, cuz I dun fink anyfing can [I]properly[/I] cut a 0.2 inches heavy steel sheet easily enough to properly generate a blade shape. The sword did have major issues in the first delivery, but as I stated the dude had sent my sword to dat European bloke and sent his order (for display, not practical use) to me. That rather explains a rather careless attitude towards forging his (which ended up becoming my) order, as it wosn''t supposed to be used practically.\n\nI dun know if the guys forge their steel by themselves, but I do know they have proper in-sourced or outsourced means ov melting steel and casting it into the required shape (as both my orders have been custom i.e. not in their "regular" showcase designs. both orders were prepared flawlessly, as far as the design was concerned, iv you disregard the slight issues with balance). The sharp edge ov the blade is also amazingly smooth. I wos expecting the blades to be friction-sharpened, but it turns out they sharpened ''em with some sophisticated means, not the confounded friction.\n\nAs far as I fink, they have proper means for working with steel (furnaces, hot molding and all) but they dun give proper attention to local orders. That''s a general trend ov Pakistani businessmen. They don''t treat their local fellows seriously, even iv they are their major provit generators. Their attention stays focused at overseas markets for some unknown reason.\n\nI fink E.T. means Entertainingly Troublesome.', ''),

(608731, ' [QUOTE=Fraz;445733]Ive used the mp5 very frequently and did face a few FTEs, however ammo and the gun''s maintenance is also a factor leading to such issues. The primary reason for it being sacked is the present war scenario in the country. IMHO MP-5 is not meant for armies, it is meant for SWAT forces and police units which have to go in close quarter battles (CQB) i.e in buildings etc. It has a very limited range but is very accurate on short range even on full auto. Easy control, low recoil and small size are its pros, FTEs are cons... Army requires infantry weapons, if you have noticed or spoken to your army buddies you will find out that army during this operation has purchased the type 56-2 by the thousands and it is the most favoured weapon of all soldiers. All combatants prefer taking the AK to the field over the G3 even. New mp5 are still being produced at Wah, they have even introduced a few derivatives of it as well. Regards[/QUOTE]\n\nIndeed but lets not forget they cite "receiver issues" that brings in quality control to some extent...they dont complain this much about G3''s though even though they too have weather and reliability issues where rough conditions are concerned.....even those folks who were in the army 5 years ago complain that this platform was a problem since its induction...the British ones that the SSG uses [only heard this never been able to confrim] are excellent pieces though, they perform adequately well so this means there is a quality control issue in house at POF.....yup the Type-56 is a fav with all my buds :D they love it...but they say that Izmash is still Izmash. The MP-5 was employed by section leaders and LT''s they all hate it.....two of the complaints I got were from guys who had men clearing rat tunnels one in Swat Valley region and another in Balochistan....perfect MP-5 scenario....and as always it crapped and the ones in Swat sadly lost their lives because of this. On the contrary G3''s have been performing well, with hitches as expected but those are quite normal where high altitude and dusty conditions are in play. The difference in caliber is something that they all praise as that lets them pin point friendlies from a mile out lol plus they say it literally shreds body armor. And yeah AK''s rule :)', ''),

(608736, ' [QUOTE=Leon;377204]The reason for high prices of European and US made weapons is restriction on export of these weapons to Pakistan imposed by EU and US. The dealers have to arrange special permissions from concerned departments which is time and money consuming. Even after obtaining these permissions, they are allowed to import limited quantity. These restrictions is quite relaxed when it comes to sporting weapons like shotguns and bolt action rifles. That is the reason, their prices are quite reasonable. It is another story that Pakistani Government don''t allow import of rifles and issue import permit in limited quantity which affects prices of rifles. But when it comes to pistols other than .22LR, they fall in the category of assault weapons thus making it difficult to get export permission from EU and US.\n\nSometimes, the dealers have to use other channels to import weapon into Pakistan like routing them from third country which again involves lot of money (import & export taxes, shipment costs), time and hassle. That''s why they charge premium on those weapons \n\nThat is the reason, the prices of pistols other than EU and US make (CZ, Taurus, Zastave, Norinco and etc) are quite reasonable.\n\nOn other hand, the money involved in getting import permit from Government of Pakistan also affect prices of weapons which dealers pass on to the consumers. So, basically it is not import duty which affects prices of weapons but other factors as well.[/QUOTE]\n\nIf that is the case then why are some brand new assault options [US made] cheaper then a Glock in the market :D I agree with @sulzar with dealers the math is 2+2=22 lolololololol taxes and import restrictions too plus mithai here and mithai there and an overall colonial and gun hating law and mind set of our decision makers....they dont want honest folks to have guns as thats a coveted right they keep for themselves.', ''),

A lot of American gun forums have shops selling ammo and guns! Why can''t we do it here?\n\nIf a small gun seller can import 400 guns a year, there are very well connected members here who can have a much higher annual import quota approved and stamped letter.[/QUOTE]\nThere is a simple answer to that.....The US constitution guarantees the right of its citizens to bear arms. The laws of each state must conform to a certain extent with the basic tenets of the federal constitution. Gun laws still vary widely from state to state especially since the new president is partial to anti-gun campaigners many blue states are steadily restricting gun ownership and introducing ever more stringent control protocols. Our law on the other hand is mostly colonial in nature. We havent changed our laws that much and thus our constitution and our various legal codes dont guarantee nor deny gun rights....what this does is it leaves a gray area which govt''s exploit.....the British raj used this gray area to award favors to prominent families by letting them have as much as they wanted. \n\nFor instance my family was the owner of a small arsenal of rifles and auto pistols. There were even some SMG''s but most of them were confiscated before partition sadly. This practice of favoritism is still in play as gun politics are still ripe and present great opportunities to win people over and thus our civilian gun ownership regime actually encourages illegal ownership rather than legal ownership....the lack of PB and NPB permits is a good example of that....\n\nMany of our well connected members are as you said "well connected" because they are in the loop [no offence meant] and if they start moving their weight around too much they will be tossed out of the loop as gun politics helps make more money then gun dealerships ever could :D\n\nI dont think our laws will allow PG to permit dealing here, licences and permits and what not....they will need a premises for sure and clearance to sell through out Pakistan as our membership base is very diverse.

You can''t use a metal cutter either, cuz I dun fink anyfing can [I]properly[/I] cut a 0.2 inches heavy steel sheet easily enough to properly generate a blade shape. The sword did have major issues in the first delivery, but as I stated the dude had sent my sword to dat European bloke and sent his order (for display, not practical use) to me. That rather explains a rather careless attitude towards forging his (which ended up becoming my) order, as it wosn''t supposed to be used practically.\n\nI dun know if the guys forge their steel by themselves, but I do know they have proper in-sourced or outsourced means ov melting steel and casting it into the required shape (as both my orders have been custom i.e. not in their "regular" showcase designs. both orders were prepared flawlessly, as far as the design was concerned, iv you disregard the slight issues with balance). The sharp edge ov the blade is also amazingly smooth. I wos expecting the blades to be friction-sharpened, but it turns out they sharpened ''em with some sophisticated means, not the confounded friction.\n\nAs far as I fink, they have proper means for working with steel (furnaces, hot molding and all) but they dun give proper attention to local orders. That''s a general trend ov Pakistani businessmen. They don''t treat their local fellows seriously, even iv they are their major provit generators. Their attention stays focused at overseas markets for some unknown reason.\n\nI fink E.T. means Entertainingly Troublesome.[/QUOTE]\n\nWhen i said hammer-forged, it did not mean just banging metal into shape with hammers and nails. hammer forging is heating up metal till it is white hot and easily malleable then hammering it into shape ,then using a abrasive to polish and sharpen. They start off with metal rods, i believe not sheets, your next statement, almost any industrial CNC machine/lathe/mill can easily ( through drilling ) create a sword shape out of metal. \n\nThe only way to sharpen a metal blade is to use friction. To achieve the edge you say, a tungsten carbide plate would have probably been used. \n\nSand.Your spelling and grammar.\n Stop screwing about.\n I had to read it all over 7 times(literally) to understand anything at all.\n I will kill you for this.', ''),

(608942, ' It''s not literal translation. It''s the translation of the meaning of the group name. Pelycosaurs were a group animals which were sort of intermediate between reptiles and mammals, originating some 340 or 350 million years ago.\n\nWhen you begin writing about them, you have two choices:\n\n1- Use the same phrase in urdu alphabets (known as transliteration). Since one would be dealing with literally several dozens of scientific terms, simply writing them with urdu alphabets would make the book a mix-up of two languages. Not only writing pelycosaur in urdu alphabets appears outrageously stupid, it is also incorrect. Every scientific name has (and should have) an origin which can be traced down. Similarly, when you write some scientific term in urdu, it should also have an origin and it should also hold clues about the meanings of the name. While pelyx and sauros do have meanings in greek (which is the standard language for western scientific terminology), they have no meanings whatsoever in urdu. So when you write "pelycosaur" in urdu, you are in fact stating it loud and clear that your language is incapable of defining the meanings of this scientific term concisely and easily.\n\n2- You dig up the etymology (meanings of names) of pelycosaur and you translate it in your language. You have a standard term for sauros/reptiles which is hawwam. This leaves pelyx, which is bowl. You can actually use any available urdu term for bowl, join it with hawwam, and your phrase would be technically correct. So if you write "hawwam-e-pyala" that would also be technically correct, although outrageously stupid and childish. The word "jaam" is rather literary and feels beautiful enough to serve the meanings of bowl, so you get to write hawwam-e-jaam.\n\nSomeone might also think that one could name pelycosaurs by themselves, regardless of what the term actually means. But that would be a fatal error. As stated earlier, every scientific term has, and should have a proper meaning. So simply coming up with whatever cool name one can think of for something would be a completely erratic approach toward the matter. When somebody reads hawwam-e-jaam and dig up its roots, they can compare it with pelycosaur and come to know that both mean the same thing (bowl reptiles). This coherence is, what must be maintained with whatever phrase you are facing with.\n\nAnd man ... I tell you it''s no simple work!\n\nThese are some terms I have handled with. Try coming up with your own terminology for these (keeping in mind the aforementioned rule). They will probably spin your head at 720° angle as they did mine ... in the start. Now it has become almost a habit to dig up the etymological roots, translate them, and form a phrase (some of these phrases appear really weird. even weirder than "hawwam-e-jaam" :D ). Let''s see what do you propose for these terms:\n\nThyreophora. Ankylosaurs. Pachycephalosaurs. Therapsids. Osteoderms. Sphenacodonts. Biarmasuchia. Theriodontia. Gorgonopsia.\n\nNow tell me: would you rather translate these terms into urdu or engage in a gunfight with 20 rogues, with only a NP-42 and 4 spare loaded magazines? :whoo::heh::bounce::lol::laugh::pound:', ''),

We use hookies and fish-cord, dug up earthworms as bait (we later started using wheat-flour as earthworms attracted more turtles than fish) and spent whole days waiting for the reed indicator to shake. I sometimes want to be 14 again ... *nostalgic*\n\nIf I were at your place (Enigmatic), I would have done the same. When we caught fish, we never put the poor things in shallow water. We just placed them on dry land, so they died quickly (but painfully maybe? choking to death isn''t easy. even getting shot appears less agonising :( ). Sometimes we placed them in small pools of water and brought them back home alive and swimming. We would then get fresh ground water from the nalka (hand-pump, you unlearned children. duh!) and place them fish in them. Somehow the fish which live in the nehers (canal seems too stupid and unclassy) were always found laying upside down on the water surface, shouting out loud from a distance "I''m dead! I''m dead!". I used to wonder for hours why/how they could survive in the neher and yet die in the nalka-water.\n\nI want to go spear-fishing. It''s a pity they don''t do it here in pak. It sounds quite fun (unless you are at the fish side of the activity).\n\nMatapa man, administrator thing was nothing. I have several others at my disposal.

I have a Glock 19. I''m not rich in any way by today''s standards but Alhamdolillah I''m satisfied. I purchased this Glock in installments after a long wait because I couldn''t afford one upfront. Had to even trade-in my CZ P-07 Duty in the process.\nMy point is that dear brother, the bitter reality of life is that Glocks are insanely over priced here in Pakistan and over hyped around the world. So you can''t buy a Glock here for the price of a Taurus or CZ. That being said, every gun owner irrespective of what he has and can afford has the right to be proud of his firearm(s), show off and brag about while in the limits of enthusiasm.

I bet most of us put through the pipe a fair amount of rounds to get to know the weapon and become familiar with its peculiarities, not to mention the establishment of a degree of satisfaction over reliability to qualify for a place in the IWB. Your handguns have spit out almost 27,000 rounds of various cals (according to your post) excluding those FTFs and the weapons that you do not wish to reveal here. One could imagine your enthusiasm, experience and capability / willingness to spend. And that is a compliment. Yet you lambast the guy who snaps a photo of his Glock with a Rolex (or Zippo for that matter)?\nThe point is, dear Faisji, where I gravely differ with you (1) Showing off Glocks or speaking about them does not necessarily mean that the particular guy is trying to show that he''s rich and (2) We would all love to buy Glocks for US $429 and H&Ks for US $900 but that is not happening here in our country (at least not in our lifetimes maybe).
