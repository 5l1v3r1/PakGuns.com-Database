They would not control smuggling but reshuffle duties, again, coz its easy.\n\nThe same thing is happening in hunting now. They are squeezing the legal hunters only and doing nothing to control loss of habitat, illegal hunting and poaching, coz its easy and other measures are difficult, rather challenging.\n\nOk, so you have inreased the fee, but what have you planned to give to hunters in return. A shortened hunting season, with all sorts of curbs imposed to curtail their bags.\n\nI would say the whole plan of Khar Sb. is extremely discouraging for legal hunters and he would gain nothing out of it.\n\n[b]Our only hope is a strong writ petition in the High Court[/b].[/quote]\n\n\nAt last someone has spoken sense.

We either discourage or never feel comfortable with new members and novice hunters unless and until we have a really close relation with the new members. There are various logical reasons and justifications for doing so, that I complete agree with\n\nOne the other hand there is no shortcut to experience and if a mature and professional hunter will not transfer and share his experience to younger then every novice hunter will repeat the same mistakes and will only learn with the passage of time.\n\nI believe that this is a moral obligation on seniors to train juniors and this is only possible when seniors spend time with juniors in the field.

(112263, ' [quote=KageFox]Since I saw this thread discussing the Taurus PT845, I thought I''d post a link to a review of this handgun from Shooting Times.\n\n[url]http://www.shootingtimes.com/handgun_reviews/ST_taurusbigboredblft_200812/index.html[/url][/quote]\nKageFox brother, thanks for posting a very useful link, as always. :)\n\n\n\n@All\nWent through the complete review and finally concluded that if the data given in the review is correct, it is perhaps one of the most accurate and most potent 4 inch barrel pistols ever manufactured. I wonder why most LEAs and Armies don''t read these reviews and select a better gun for them which is cheap, accurate, reliable and offers numerous extra features? Aquarius brother and his friend, both found PT845 quite inaccurate, but may be they got the lemons and now Taurus has improved? [b]The review gives the accuracy of PT845 at 2.68 inches and 2.75 inches group from 25 yards which is simply awesome and worthy of being a match / competition pistol.[/b] \n\n[b]Was just wondering about the authenticity of many such reviews.[/b] If one goes through the reviews of 24/7 Pro on the web, many reviews rate it extremely high though there are a few negative ones as well. My personal shooting experience with 24/7 (at least four of them) has always been awful. [b]One wonders how come there is so much of difference in the performance stated in reviews and the actual performance on ground.[/b] One actually starts thinking that am I an absolute dumb who has no idea what a handgun is? Or may be the one that I got was a lemon and others would be good? (These comments do not apply to Taurus 1911 and PT92/99 series pistols, who have proved themselves well in the arena)\n\n[b]I think Taurus have well appreciated the impact of internet on a common user and are exploiting it to its fullest.[/b] After having failed most trials for induction of their handguns in armies and LEAs, they are now focusing on individual buyers. They have known it well enough that most civilian buyers have average knowledge of the handguns, do not fire much and keep the guns well preserved for SD purpose only.  Therefore, those aspects that are revealed to the trial people of LEAs when they rough out their pistols would mostly not be exposed to a common civilian buyer. Hence the importance of good finish, impressive looks and extra features. Web reviews will take care of rest of the things :) \n\nYesterday, an acquaintance of mine was heard saying that he would buy a PT 809E, come what may. Someone (who is an old gun enthusiast and senior member of PG) advised him that Taurus handguns had mixed reviews and he might like to consider other options as well. The gentleman replied that even if PT809 misfires every round that one attempts to fire with it, even than he would go for it because its sooooo damn beautiful. For accurate and reliable firing, I have other guns with me, he said. "This one is for its sheer beauty" :)', ''),

(112336, ' [quote=AK47]That''s a "collector" speaking, and to some extent, I feel, this is Taurus marketing "Target group" also, people who just love the [i]aesthetics[/i] of the new line guns by Taurus. :P [/quote]\nFully agreed Sir. However, another fact to mention here is that all weapon companies who have prospered in this business have been able to get contracts from LEAs and armies. That is where the bulk order lies and more importantly, it does not finish with one order. It''s a continuous supply over the years. Just for example, Browning High Power has been used by around 30 different armies and even a bigger number of LEAs which over the years has resulted in production of millions of handguns. FN Herstal and Browning would have never been that successful had they targeted the individual customer. Just another angle to the same thing :) \n\n[quote=AK47]I''ll tell you [b]ONE[/b] thing guyz, if ever in the foreseeable future, Taurus DOES come over these quality issues, matching FUNCTIONALITY and AESTHETICS to come at par,  their guns will be the most popular ones in the world with respect to price and beauty. [/quote]\nAgain fully agreed. But to do this, in my personal view, Taurus has to remain focused on what they want to do. Now Taurus is in habit of releasing too many models (with minor changes off course) every year. Have a look at the top companies like Colt, H&K, Beretta, Sig Sauer, Browning etc. They have worked on very few models but have brought those models to perfection. One can just compare the data that how many models H&K or Beretta has released in the past ten years and how many Taurus has released during the same time. Perfection can''t be achieved with so many handguns around because the effort gets diluted as each handgun takes some investment in R&D etc. I think Taurus should select few of their best models and than focus on improving them more and more, bringing them at par with other top models.  \n\n\n\n[quote=KageFox]As you stated, if you look up reviews of the 24/7 and its brethren, you''ll notice much positive feedback, at times much to the surprise of the reviewer. [b]Though a careful reading of the reviews will suggest that high quality, usually branded, ammunition was used for the results of the review.[/b] Being an avid magazine reader, I was shocked and surprised by the heavy fire towards the 24/7, when I joined this forum. [/quote]\nSir, at same time one would also find many comments in independent forums in USA where the individual users were fed up with the ammo sensitivity of Taurus guns and they were also firing high end ammo brands available in USA. \nThat is where I get doubtful about these apparently very scientifically written reviews which seems to be very different from the opinion of common users. \n\nI am a shooter and I know very well that making a 2.68 inches or 2.75 inches group consistently with a 4 inch barrel handgun from 25M is not easy and can only be done with a very high quality handgun with match components fitted in it. A normal combat handgun usually does not perform to this standard. Frankly, I would like to see the video of the reviewer who made 2.68 and 2.75 inches groups using a Taurus PT845 :)   \n\n\n[quote=KageFox]Anyone on this forum who has (dared to :D) shoot the 24/7 with only non-POF ammo? [/quote]\nI have fired hundreds of POF rounds with three different 24/7 and have seen hundreds more fired by my friends in front of me. The performance has been least impressive with a large number of FTFs and FTEs (and sometime both FTF and FTE at the same time). FTFs occurred with Chinese and Russian ammo as well.  \n\n\n[quote=KageFox]I think I saw the OSS in one the threads here... hopefully the person who owns it can enlighten us about its performance...[/quote]\nI am sure Denovo sahib who owns this OSS would enlighten us on this. However, I had the honour to test fire that OSS and result can be seen in the Accuracy Thread. Its a good gun but not an outstanding gun; certainly far better than 24/7 Pro in my view because we did not observe any ammo sensitivities :)', ''),

I agree with you that Viking is better than Glock in two aspects, one the ability of firing very hot loads and secondly, the quality of trigger (I am talking about off the market Glocks and not customised Glocks). Though 7N21 is not available to civilian users (at least not in Pakistan) and we would never know what difference it makes practically, nevertheless, this capability of Viking makes it very reliable and durable with all types of ammo that we get in Pakistan. On the other hand, Glock has never been known as the best gun for firing hotter loads. \n\nThe other advantage of Viking is its price which is four to six times less than the price of Glock. \n\n[b]However, in my personal reckoning, Glock 17 is more accurate than Viking and is excellent for combat shooting / fast engagement of multiple targets.[/b] Baikal also has natural pointability which helps in quick engagement of multiple targets however, Glock is comparatively more accurate. \n\nMoreover, cheap availability of after market parts is a great advantage, though not in Pakistan but in other parts of the world. :) Even in Pakistan, it is easier to get Glock accessories as compared to most other high end handguns. \n\nWhere Viking can not beat Glock in Pakistan is the reputation / psychological ascendancy that Glock enjoys and Viking so far does not. When a user is using Glock, he is very confident that he is using a very reliable and top class handgun. Viking, though reputed very well, has not been able to attain this level of confidence with the user. I know its nothing practical rather something psychological, nevertheless, it matters in Pakistan because Glock has become kind of a status symbol. \n\nGlock is certainly better in finish which I feel Baikal guys really need to improve in case of Viking.\n\nCZ999 Scorpion, I agree, is a great pistol which is very accurate, solid and reliable. We are lucky to get it cheap in Pakistan. :) \n\nJust my two cents on the subject :)', ''),

The holster fits perfectly, and lies flat against the body but tends to slide on the belt while worn, due to softness of the material used. We figured that if that design were replicated in a harder material like leather, this issue would be solved. Unfortunately, Abba cannot easily make a leather holster due to lack of proper equipment.\n\nWe did try to get a leather version made through dealer friend of his, but the company approached refused... apparently they wanted a larger order than just a single piece.\n\nCan it be done?[/quote]\n\nBro if u provide he sample it can be done. And i have somthing to share with all of u guys and especially the ones who ask for a holster in a softer material. Bros if softer material is used the holster and the belt hangs and has a short useful life as a metal handgun is carried in it. The standard way of holster is using a stronger and harder material which can withstand the weight of the handgun. The softer material is used for IWB holsters and sum of shoulder holsters otherwise one has to buy a leather piece and get it stitched to ur softer material the way AK did and recommended. :)', ''),

Now here in Pakistan, Glock costs 5-8 times the price of CZ999 and 4-7 times the price of Viking. If you ask me that is Glock a 5 or 8 times better pistol than CZ999 or Viking? [b]My answer would be a big no.[/b] However, people in Pakistan (including me) not only have confidence in Glock, it has become sort of a status symbol. This is an important factor when it comes to buying a handgun, specially for those who can afford. Viking and CZ999 on the other hand are considered cheap guns which offer good quality in less price. Ironically, Glock enjoys the same status in US. :lol: Logically, it may not be a strong argument but it matters here :)\n\nOn accuracy part however, I would say that Glock and CZ999 are comparable and better than Viking\n\n\n[quote=Luger]so  for  less  money  you  can  have  golden  cz  99  than  black  sig  226\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PquOYjS][img]http://s3.postimage.org/uOYjS.jpg[/img][/url][/quote]\nWow, I would love to have this beauty, anytime, everytime. :P I wonder why this gun is not exported to Pakistan :rolleyes:\n\n\n[quote=Luger]polymer  is  not  and  hardly  ever  will  be  strong  as  steel,  also  aluminum.[/quote]\nAbsolutely agreed.

I have this option in mind. however the problem with rifled chokes is that there is no such thing as "one size fits all". therefore their availability in the market is next to impossible if not totally impossible. on the other hand, desi shotgun are rarely provided with threads to be used with chokes. so I guess rifled choke option goes out the window for desi shotguns.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(112581, ' Dear 12gauge,\n\nWell, what I am writing is based on practical experience. I cant say why you are facing over size problem from your moulds.\n\nI have used both Slugs with Shaheen standard wad, which are used in no.4 –8. Without any problem of over size, they fit perfectly in Shot cup. Wad along with Slug seat perfectly in the Hull.\n\nLyman slug  perfectly fit in shot cup DEPTH. In case of Lee slug I have to put cardboard spacer between the shot cup and the slug for proper crimp. \n\nThe idea of rifle choke is for the shotgun with changeable choke tube option. Rifle chokes for 12/20g is common in U.S. they are available for almost every shotgun @ $40/-. \n\nSlugs can be used in fix choke shotgun as well, guns which have open chokes. I have fired few in Desi Slide action shot gun without any problem.', ''),

The P2Z cartridge means that it is the double charged cartridge with more powerful propellent ..this is for SMG MP5. The same ammo is not recommended to be used in pistols as it generates unsafe chamber pressures in handguns. The PIIZ is infact read as P1Z which means that this is the milder cartridge intended for use in pistols. The P2Z ammo is issued to Army. The P1Z is for law enforcement and pistols.\nPOF at times does things ina confused manner still I fail to umderstand the PIIZ marking it should be marked as P1Z.\nmayber Skeeter 60 should educate us more on that.\nRegards\n\nBloodBath', ''),

This one was shooting low and little on the left, however, groups were impressive for a small barrel pistol. Unlike the other PT145, which was found accurate at 10 M & 20 only, this one held its line at 30 M also with reasonable accuracy. The trigger was reasonably good, could have been better. The recoil was manageable but I had this feeling that probably a .45 ACP is a little too much for the little beauty [b](nanni si jan pe buhut zulm hey :lol:)[/b]. This may be a false feeling with me only and others may not feel it this way. My advice to Naveed sahib is to [b]keep the front size tip a little higher while aiming with this particular handgun[/b] and it will shoot fine. \n[b]Overall, a very nice CC handgun which will sure deliver at the time of need. \n[/b]\nPlease don''t get carried away with the numbers and do read my comments about how to analyse the accuracy of a sub-compact handgun in the previous PT145 test report.', ''),

As you can see the groups are well centered and quite compact. And look at the ten meter group in pic no 2. Would have been a less than 1 inch group had I not hit one bullet away. Look how 4 bullets are within three quarter of an inch. The recoil is quite manageable.

However, [b]they have one grave drawback[/b] because of which, despite its inherent inclination towards accuracy, rotating barrel design has not been adopted by most top weapon manufacturers (you can count that how many rotating barrel pistols have been manufactured so far?). [b]That drawback is the alignment of feed ramp with the chamber.[/b] Feed ramp is not located on the barrel in a rotating barrel mechanism. Due to this, even if there is a slight mis-alignment of feed ramp with the barrel, the feeding of the bullet may not take place correctly. This affects the reliability of the pistol. I have experienced  this problem both in CF98 and in Stoeger Cougar (more in CF98) but its not to an alarming extent. It''s occasional, say one out of 100 or 200 bullets. Depends how clean the weapon is, quality of ammo etc. [b]Even in today''s test, there was one failure to feed.[/b] IMHO, CF98 and Stoeger Cougar, though excellent guns otherwise, will always have these occasional feeding problems because of the location of feed ramp on the connector. Perhaps that is the reason that Sig, Colt, H&K, Glock, S&W, CZ, Walther and many other top brands do not have any model with rotating barrel. In fact as per my knowledge, there are only three pistols with rotating barrel being manufactured nowadays; PX4 Storm, Stoeger Cougar and CF98.\n \nNevertheless, rotating barrel pistols are more accurate but are not the most accurate. The most accurate design in my view is the fixed barrel mechanism that you find in Makarov, Walther PPK, Steyer GB etc. Fixed barrel also has its own problems in other areas and is not suitable for powerful ammos like 9x19 parabellum and upwards :). That is why you find this design in low potency ammos like .22, .32 ACP, .380 ACP, 9x18 Makarov etc (less Steyer GB which is in 9x19 para). I am sure other knowledgeable members can give better input on the subject. Skeeter60 sahib, 12guage, Mr Luger, where are you?', ''),

(112889, ' This set of 9mm snap caps was purchased from Buksh Elahi, Lhr.\nAsking price was Rs. 1500. Final negotiated price Rs. 1400. On Amazon etc, similar sets are for $10 - 15 so this price isn''t bad considering this item is not commonly found here\nIt was couriered to me by Moiz at Buksh Elahi via PIA''s speedex overnight delivery at no extra charge.\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Snap%20Caps/DSC_0116.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Snap%20Caps/DSC_0117.jpg[/img]\n\nMyself and a friend of mine have regularly practiced dry firing with these through his Stoeger Cougar 8000\n\n[b]Initial reaction:[/b]\nWe loaded a mag with these. And lo and behold, the very first snap cap failed to load! It got stuck at an uncanny angle whereby it didn''t clear. The slide was stuck mid way into battery. Fortunately the weapon could be field stripped and we extracted it. The others cycled fine, but a pretty unauspicious beginning. Same round was troublesome again so we don''t use it now\n\n[b]Notes on wearing out:[/b]\nFollowing up on an earlier discussion on the life of a cap, the following picture shows (from the left in order) an unused cap, a cap with 20 hits and one with over a hundred hits. Yes we have been primarily busy taking turns practicing marksmanship principles. It doesn''t seem like this is near the end of life for the third cap, when compared to the second. These are spring mounted snap caps, so the incremental wear may be less and less. I''ll report again when we feel one is dead. \n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Snap%20Caps/DSC_0121.jpg[/img]\n\nAnother thing illustrated below is wear because of repeatedly sliding the most used cap into the magazine vs the unused one\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Snap%20Caps/DSC_0122.jpg[/img]', ''),
(112890, ' [b]Dry fire practice with snap caps:[/b]\n[b]Safety first[/b] [i](and i mean almost but not quite maniacical safety):[/i]\nEvery practice session was strictly 1/2 hour long. In each, the four safety rules were observed as follows:\n1- The weapon was double checked for clearance by each of us. The live rounds were counted, put back in their box and stored in a different location in the house\n2- Dry firer''s and observer''s postions were selected such that there was never an arc of motion that covered either person\n3- The only time the fingers were on the trigger were when the weapon was indexed on the target with an acquired sight picture\n4- The back stop was a concrete wall. No possibility of accidental penetration. If that!\n\n[b]Practicing marksmanship. Building the case for dry fire practice:[/b]\n1. Aligning sights and putting them over the target to acquire sight picture, acheiving minimum arc of motion and exercising breath control. Just this, repeated over and over is a great great practice tool. You start getting ready on the target sooner and more predictably\n2. Achieving surprise trigger break from both a double action and a single action pull without flinching or disrupting sight alignment. Since the weapon doesn''t cycle, you can''t do a string of uninterrupted SA shots. DA, you can but that isn''t useful or even valid practice espcially for DA/SA guns. Certainly not for the Cougar\n3. Follow through. Deliberately keeping the trigger pressed all the way to the rear while mentally ''reacquiring'' the target (although the gun stays on target. You just simulate this)\n4. Trigger reset. Again, the trigger always resets to DA mode and we have to be wary of ingraining this too deeply. Actual range time with live fire is paramount\n\nIt can be rightly said that all this can be achieved without snap caps. However, the marginal benefit here is that you administratively load your weapon before getting ready to fire which simulates your range preparation for fire better than an empty weapon. When done, the drill is, you clear the weapon much the same way as you would on the range\n\nThe real benefits of snap caps will be covered in a subsequent post to follow soon, hopefully', ''),

His options?\n\n- Legal implications if found by police to have a loaded handgun in his car (when with family).\n\n- Legal way out?[/quote]\n\nAlso, do tell us about the UN Department of Safety and Security, if possible.[/quote]\n\n\n\n1st of All dear friends I want to clear some points.. I am very sorry to be so late cuz u guys know wht r the situations in karachi and now a days we LEA,s are very busy and facing a hard time....\n\n1. Mostly people are fooled by the agents at home dept or mailny arms dealers that they can provide u Sec 144 exemption letter. Dear friends since last 3 years most of these letters which are issued to civilians are fake means they dont have any entries in the record of Home Dept.... OR.... Mostly they fool u by handing over u simply a weapon carrying permit but most people dont read the details which r mentioned in small fonts that " THIS LETTER WILL BE CONSIDERED AS NULL OR VIOD IF SEC 144 IS IMPOSED" So be careful with it....\n\n2. Any Civilian having a NPB weapon with valid licence is not allowed to carry a weapon even in a vehicle with or without family when SEC 144 is imposed....  If police found they can be in a trouble because u will be considered as violating sec 144 and they can launch FIR under sec 188. According to the definition , “Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) empowers a district government to issue orders in public interest that may place a ban on an activity for a specific period of time extending to two months. Such a ban is enforced by the police who register cases under section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code for violations of the ban. Section 188 carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison or a fine of up to Rs. 10000 or both. The ban may be lifted by the district government or re-imposed at any time after the expiry of the two-month period”.\n\n3. UNDSS (United Nations Department of Safety and Security) is a dept that is responsible for the safety of UN staff , vehicles, UN property and also responsible for the safe completion of the UN Missions here in Pakistan. I am working for the UNDSS Sindh it means i am responsible for the staff safety and security in my region...

(113171, ' Missed AK sahibs wonderful post somehow. Thanks for your comments Sir :)\n\n\n[quote=AK47]Denovo Sir''s valuable input about the natural Beretta POA of 6 o''clock has calmed a bit, yet I''m still not quite sure that "quality control" can have this much of influence upon accuracy between the two Stoegers used. :rolleyes:[/quote]\nThis is quite a normal thing and except a few high end companies which carry out proof testing of every handgun they sell and at times place the target result in the box (signed by the firer) for the satisfaction of the customer, most companies have variations in the results of the handguns of same model. In case of better companies, the variation in POI of different pistols of the same model is not much and sights are better aligned, however, in case of ordinary companies, this difference is too drastic at times :) \n\nAs for aiming 6''oclock with all Berettas, I am not sure about it. I have always been aiming center mass with all pistols, except for those about which I clearly know that it shoots up or down. During these tests, however, I have always aimed center mass for all pistols, regardless of the results. \n\nBTW, this center mass or 6''oclock thing is truly practicable at 10 M only. At 20 M, 1 inch bull is hardly visible from the sights and one is generally aiming in the center and at 30 M, the bull is just not visible and almost complete target hides behind the front sight :D\n\n\n\n[quote=AK47]Perhaps you should have tried them out on different days, coz though you''re testing out "machines", you''re not a "machine" yourself, and I feel there''s even, from a natural outcome of constant physical and "[i]concentrationa[/i]l" exertion, a likelihood that your very own "consistency" may be a bit [i]variable[/i] here as well, especially when testing out multiple weapons on a single day. [/quote]\nYes, fatigue does have effect on firer and it must have effected the test of CF98 and Winamax which I tested in the end. Both Stoegers were the first ones to be tested and I was absolutely fresh at that time. So they got the best out of me. Sir, I truly feel the amount of effort and seriousness I put in the Stoeger tests, had I done the same for all other guns tested previously, their results might have been quite different. I also feel that with the passage of time, I have improved too. Now I have become sort of an expert in conducting these typical tests and if you have noticed, its not just the Stoeger! All test that I conducted yesterday were better in results. So I somehow feel sorry for the guns that I tested in the beginning, ie, a month back or so :D May retest some of them if I get an opportunity. :) \n\n\n\n[quote=AK47]On another note, let me just say, I was thinking just this afternoon, before even coming to know of your Stoeger tests today, that the "Hogue" grip, adding some [i]increased[/i] width to the already wide grip of the Cougar, may give the shooter a bit more UPWARD[b] POA [/b]than a gun with a slightly "narrower" grip. :rolleyes: [/quote]\nIMHO, it did not make much of difference. Both Stoegers had hogue grips on. With first, POI was correct and with the second, it was a little up. \n\n\n\n[quote=AK47]I look very much forward to presenting you some guns myself, [b]anytime in the foreseeable future[/b], Inshallah. :)\n[/quote]\nSir could you narrow it down to something like very near future :lol: :lol:\n\nregards :)', ''),

Initially collected all stamps but later specialised in Pakistan, Great Britain, and Indian States (pre partition). Have a complete collection of Pakistan till 1985 but after that, there are many wides. Used to regularly go to GPO and buy the First Day Covers on the very first day of issue. \n\n[b]Reading[/b] Started as a child with child story book and have continued ever since till to date. Like to read about history, autobiographies and Urdu literature. Awaz e Dost has been my favourite book in Urdu and Animal Farm in English literature. Love to read Arnold J. Toynbee and Ibn e Khuldoon for historical works. Have my own library of over 500 books. \n\n[b]Fishing[/b] This is my favourite outdoor activity. For me, there is no substitute for sitting in a wilderness near clear blue water (mobile must be switched off). Have fished in most parts of Pakistan and have enjoyed fishing trips in Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, Hongkong and South Korea. Have a room full of fishing gear and love to do all three types, ie, fly fishing, lure fishing and bait fishing. My sons are normally my fishing partners. \n\n[b]Travelling[/b] Love to travel to new and far flung areas and like to know about their history, culture and customs. Have seen most of Pakistan and 13 other countries. Museum, botanical garden, Fish Worlds / Aquariums and Anar Kali like cultural bazars are my favourite places during my visits. \n\n[b]Digital Photography[/b] Have a collection of over 10,000 pics of my own with a large number of thematic photographs. Have a good collection of Pakistani lakes and Pakistani Forts. Have mostly used some model of Nikon which I somehow like the best. \n\n[b]Shooting[/b] Have been shooting since last 25 years casually but started proper target shooting only six months back. Thanks to PG, nowadays I give lot of time to this hobby :) \n\nregards :)', ''),

(113244, ' Gilani sahib, yes the box for those POF 2Z ammo was in fact marked 1Z... Thank you again for responding.\n\nBack to the accuracy tests. I had the opportunity to test two handguns yesterday, the Beretta 92FS and the CZ999, both with courtesy from our fellow member and my good friend Kamranwali. Gilani sahib, before I post the detailed review, I must say that I didn''t quite understand why we''re testing these handguns for accuracy from 10 meters... it''s simply too close... All standard big bore handgun precision shooting distances are 25 meters and above. If we are trying to assess these guns for SD/HD/Combat distances then it doesn''t make sense to shoot from a bench. Furthermore, If a handgun is or is not accurate at 20 meters, I believe that is enough information for us to know how it will do at 10 meters. I had issues testing the Viking at the Islamabad Gun Club at this range and now that I finally managed to try the 92FS and CZ999 at a private location, the available backstop was a 10 foot [b]rock wall[/b] covered with only a foot-or-so of earth with lots of stones in it! I''m sorry, but there''s no way I was going to shoot a POF 2Z from a Beretta \n92FS or a CZ999 sitting 10 meters away with such a backstop :o - Safety first. Under the given conditions, I was barely comfortable with the closest distance of 15 meters...\n\nAnyway, enough of my complaining... here are the results:', ''),

(113248, ' While reviewing these results the following points should be considered:\n\n1. Both handguns unfortunately didn''t belong to me. So it did take a bit of adjusting even during the tests which surely affected results. I''m quite sure the results would be much better than mine with more practice on these guns.\n\n2. My closest distance is 15 meters as opposed to 10 meters. Shots fired from these handguns at 10 meters would improve results significantly.\n\nAfter conducting the handgun accuracy tests for the Viking, 92FS and CZ999, for one, I''m totally convinced that:\n\n1. These tests should only be conducted using a machine rest or by a professional pistol shooting expert using a custom and carefully constructed benchrest, if we want to rely on the results and base them for our buying and shooting decisions. If we can''t get a machine rest, I strongly suggest that we leave these tests to the Pros or become Pros and then conduct these tests :). [b]Nevertheless[/b], its good fun and one learns a lot about his shooting technique while conducting the tests. The exercise is better than just shooting at targets randomly without a purpose...\n\n2. Shooting a big bore handgun from 10 meters doesn''t tell us much about the precision of these guns. The distances should be 15 meters (if you insist on close range testing) and 25 meters. That would be more appropriate I believe.\n\n3. Every odd shot with such good handguns outside the black rings is indeed my (the shooter''s) error. I could tell my mistakes the moment the shot would go off, mostly attributing to some error with trigger squeeze or the grip or breathing. So for all shots in the white rings and the relatively lesser score acquired, I am to be blamed, not these fabulous handguns :)\n\nGilani sb, kindly also share why the scores for grouping are only taken for 15 shots and not all 30? Taking scores for only 15 shots raises the overall percentage score as the denominator becomes 450 intead of 600. Thank you for bearing with my long posts and I look forward to your responses. \n\nSalaams and best regards.', ''),

(113383, ' A New Rifle barrel when broken in properly (like running in of a new car ) adds many more years and rounds which can be fired accurately through it .\n\nFirst of all degrease with a solvent and clean and then dry thoroughly.\n\nFire one shot ( not in the air please) then completely clean with a bronze brush and copper solvent removing all traces of copper left in the barrel.\n\nAfter drying with clean swabs, fire two shots and and clean again with copper solvent soaked patches and bronze brush, it might take 30 to 50 passes.  \n\nAgain after cleaning the bore completely fire another few  shots and and again completely remove the copper fouling. The coppers presence is confirmed when after firing you run a good copper solvent soaked patch through the bore and it comes out green, specially if you let the barrel remain wet with solvent for an hour or so.\n\nYou can vary the number of rounds in between but the fewer, in between cleanings, the better.\n\nThe whole idea is to polish the bore and remove all traces of tooling marks on the rifling; if not properly broken in the way described;  once the bore  catches copper fired from the first few rounds it remains the same and the bore is slightly constricted at those points i where roughnes is present as it catches copper. This constriction swages bullets fired later causing the accuracy to deteriorate.\n\nYou will have tired hands and arms and consumed ammo worth quite a bit but you will be later rewarded with an  accurate rifle which will be easy to clean and have a long accurate life.\n\nGood news is that a used rifle can also benifit by first completely removing the copper deposits, which is an up hill task and you could be disappointed to find after a thorough cleaning that there is pitting under the copper and what you considered a shinny bore earlier,  after a thorough cleaning emerges to be pitted.\n\nNever use emery or any abrasive to clean n shine the bore as it will be ruined. There are special pastes and compounds for this purpose and only of use when proper instructions are followed. There are methods known as Fire Lapping etc but those are only for the very advanced gurus.\n\nThe above will not benefit Rim fire weapons', ''),

(113471, ' [quote=Gilani]Durrani sahib, let me wholeheartedly acknowledge that a very good effort. Regardless of the results achieved, it adds to the diversity of this thread. Thanks for taking the trouble of conducting test in this hot weather (I realised it after the tests that it was very very hot nowadays :lol: )[/quote]\n\nThank you Gilani sahib, it was indeed hot, but to tell you the truth I was enjoying the tests too much to pay any attention to the heat :D\n\n[quote=Gilani]BTW, how did you fire? With your hand resting on a rest / cushion or with just your elbows on the table and hands without a support (as I do)?[/quote]\n\nI shot with my elbows supported by cushions on top of a table. Hands were not supported.\n\n[quote=Gilani]I have a few suggestions for the future tests (I hope you continue with this practice :lol: )  \n\n1.  Please use two separate targets if you intend testing a gun twice (which is a preferred method). On one target, it''s difficult to analyse 30 bullets and specially the groups. \n2.  Do edit the pics by enhancing their contrast and sharpness. I cant clearly see the bullet holes inside the black area.[/quote]\n\nPoints taken. After seeing the pics of these targets, I had already decided to make my own targets in future ;)\n\n[quote=Gilani]Seeing the construction of CZ, chances of misfire are quite less and have never been reported before this. However, there may be multiple reasons for this. Before we discuss it any further, please clarify following;\n-  How was the strike on the primer? Was it a solid forceful strike or just a light one?[/quote]\n\nI''d say that the strike was [i]clearly [/i]''visible'', with a dent in the primer that couldn''t be overlooked.\n\n[quote=Gilani]-  Are you sure the ammo you are using was genuine POF2Z?\n-  I pointed it out earlier also that as I see in the pics, the marking on the box is POF1Z and bullets inside are POF2Z. How has that happened? \n-  If you still have the fired cartridges with you than please check if there are two small holes on the primer or one large hole in the center of the primer?[/quote]\n\nAs mentioned earlier, and also shared with you above, I''ve posted details and pics of the ammo used (please see link mentioned above). For me, it''s very confusing to judge whether the ammo was genuine or not as all empty shells had [b]two [/b] small primer holes, not one. Furthermore, as you will see in the pics the ammo was very clean without any signs of reloading and there were no missfires in either the 92FS or another CF98 tried with this ammo. The accuracy and feel of every shot was consistent. \n\nHowever, the following points were also noted, the rounds were a bit messy - black residue observed around the ejection port and firing pin area (which is I guess normal for POF ammo?). The box was of POF 1Z indeed - this one beats me altogether, but I don''t think this is a point of concern since the boxes of POF ammo are not sealed any way. The boxes could have been changed for convenience or due to lack of availability of boxes with the dealer... \n\nThe only point of concern I have is that primer did not have the standard ring marked around it... Since you regularly use POF 2Z ammo, it would be helpful if you could share a couple of pics of its behind...', ''),

(113528, ' Pistol: Taurus PT 809 E 9mm\nCaliber: 9mm\nSights: 3-Dot white Novaks\nDistance of Target: 15 Meters\nTarget: A4 Paper, printed type, diameter 6 inches\nBarrel: 4.2 inches\nAmmo: Polytech Chinese FMJ\nShooting Stance: Defensive style Two handed in standing position (proper isosceles)  \n\nComments: Fired total of 22 rounds. Day was way too HOT to handle and by merely getting myself to the range area I was dripping from head to toe in sweat. Soon the wind started blowing and it kept on getting faster. I found it hard to concentrate on shooting as due to open area there was too much wind blowing from 9 O clock position. The speed of wind was nearly 40km and I couldnt stop my arms from swaying across the shooting line. I was literally holding the gun on target and praying for the wind to slow down a bit and then shoot before it would start again.\n\nChinese ammo was flawless in functionality. I think chinese ammo especially this one (polytech) is hotter than both POF and Norinco 9mm. They produce more decibels as compared to the rest. \n6 O'' clock hold was used and shots were fired in defensive shooting stance (Isosceles). Shots were fired with 2 shots Per 3 seconds approximate but with several gaps due to exceeding pressure of wind on arms. \n\nConstant wind was the main factor which did not let me improve this time and later on I decided to cancel the shoot out for next week. It was better to stop rather waste Rs 45 a round which is the current price chinese are available at. POF is facing a huge shortage here and they''re selling around Rs 50 a round. \n\nI appologize for not coming up with a full length range report with pictures and videos but once paper holed deserves to be displayed in my opinion. Also I am happy that I still shoot no matter how unlucky I was :)\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxfkyZr][img]http://s1.postimage.org/fkyZr.jpg[/img][/url]\nFired 10 shots with 10 hits with a group size of 4".\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxfkQrr][img]http://s1.postimage.org/fkQrr.jpg[/img][/url]\nFired 12 round 11 hits can be seen but not sure where the 12th one went.

(113558, ' After I got my CF98, I went through almost all the threads where it was discussed. I re-read them almost completely. There have been discussions about its price, durability, authenticity, recoil spring guide, buffer function, Norinco / Intercon / Shaheen stamps, and so called clones!\n\nThere were two things lacking; one, is that in almost all of the thread or discussions there was lack of some colourful pics. (the exception is the tread in which a lot of colourful internet pics of CF98 were posted)\n\nSecond, the good features this pistol has!\n\nLet me fill this gap by a few pics! (Although, CF98 owners must be knowing about these, but I just want to make this thread more VISUAL!)\n\nThe first is the round quantity indicator on the mag. Unlike Glock and some other brands, in which you look at the bullet indicator hole and read out the no of rounds in the mag, the CF98 mag has an indicator line / pointer on its follower:\n\n[img]http://i791.photobucket.com/albums/yy197/Mangloo/CF98/CF98MagRoundIndicator.jpg[/img]\n\nThe second is the Round in chamber indicator, it is a tiny spring on the extractor which pops out when there is a round in the chamber. In the insets of the pic below, the left is normal and the right one indicates t a round in chamber!\n\n[img]http://i791.photobucket.com/albums/yy197/Mangloo/CF98/CF98RoundinChaberIndicator.jpg[/img]\n\nThe third is its ease of filling the magazine, already illustrated above!\n\nFinally, I must say that there are a lot of things which have to go right or act correctly for a CF98 to complete its operation. Like the rotating barrel function and the way a round comes out of its magazine. You will see from the pic below that the magazine is designed so that the round coming out of it automatically tries to centre itself with the barrel. \n\n[img]http://i791.photobucket.com/albums/yy197/Mangloo/CF98/CF98FeedingAngles.jpg[/img]\n\nThis, however is a good technique for alignment of rounds with the barrel, but it also makes the magazine a sensitive part. Any harm to its lips and the weapon will not feed properly. :(', ''),

(113600, ' [quote=MKKD]...........Gilani sahib, before I post the detailed review, I must say that [b]I didn''t quite understand why we''re testing these handguns for accuracy from 10 meters... it''s simply too close[/b]... [b]All standard big bore handgun precision shooting distances are 25 meters and above. If we are trying to assess these guns for SD/HD/Combat distances then it doesn''t make sense to shoot from a bench.[/b] Furthermore, If a handgun is or is not accurate at 20 meters, I believe that is enough information for us to know how it will do at 10 meters. [/quote]\nThe idea was to see the accuracy of a gun at short, medium and longer ranges, hence testing from 10, 20 and 30 M. I am quite convinced that to get a wholesome picture of the accuracy of a particular handgun, it should be tested at short as well as long distances. \n\nThis thread is meant for giving giving the [b]accuracy potential[/b] of a handgun in some kind of tangible form and that''s it. [b]Requirements of precision shooting, big bore shooting, SD/HD etc have not been given any consideration by me while conducting these tests.[/b] The test just gives the accuracy potential of a handgun. Now it is up to the user to see the results, analyse them as per his peculiar requirements and form an opinion about a particular handgun. The result just provides some tangible input to the members which helps them forming their opinions.\n\n\n\n[quote=MKKD]1. Both handguns unfortunately didn''t belong to me. So it did take a bit of adjusting even during the tests which surely affected results. I''m quite sure the results would be much better than mine with more practice on these guns.[/quote]\nMost of the guns that I fired did not belong to me either :D. Your observation is valid. It does make a difference and therefore, I normally fire 5 rounds from a gun before conducting the test, just to get a feel of trigger (most important), recoil and grip of the handgun. For an experienced shooter, this should be fair enough, IMHO. More practice with the same gun would certainly make a difference in results but not too much :) It is least likely to happen, in my view, that a gun which is in average rating jumps to accurate rating after I have practiced a lot with it. \n\n\n\n[quote=MKKD]After conducting the handgun accuracy tests for the Viking, 92FS and CZ999, for one, I''m totally convinced that:\n1. [b]These tests should only be conducted using a machine rest or by a professional pistol shooting expert using a custom and carefully constructed benchrest[/b], if we want to rely on the results and base them for our buying and shooting decisions. [/quote]\nI fully agree that tests conducted with a machine rest would be far more authentic as compared to the tests conducted by me. I certainly can''t compete with a machine.  That is why I have repeatedly mentioned on this forum that neither these tests are the most perfect tests nor I am the best firer around. This is a voluntary effort I do for this forum. However, I dont have any plans to buy a machine rest in near future. (Would like to buy some ammo with the same money) :) [b] Members can frankly give their views about the usefulness of the tests without using a machine rest (the way I conduct them) and accordingly advise whether to continue with these tests or to discontinue them.[/b] \n\nAs for relying on these tests for buying a handgun or to take shooting decisions, it is entirely up to the members to make their own decision. [b]These tests do not give any guarantee whatsoever that all handguns of the same brand will perform the way they have behaved during these tests. [/b]\n\n \n[quote=MKKD][b]If we can''t get a machine rest, I strongly suggest that we leave these tests to the Pros or become Pros and then conduct these tests :).[/b] Nevertheless, its good fun and one learns a lot about his shooting technique while conducting the tests. The exercise is better than just shooting at targets randomly without a purpose... [/quote]\nI personally have no objection and fully agree with the suggestion.  \n\n[b]PG members may look for a professional shooter and request him to conduct these tests for them. Else PG may facilitate establishing a training center where one can be trained on professional lines to conduct these tests.[/b] I will be supportive of every step that leads us towards betterment and such a step that you have suggested will certainly enhance the quality and authenticity of these tests. I would request other members to comment on this issue. \n\n\n\n\n[quote=MKKD]2. Shooting a big bore handgun from 10 meters doesn''t tell us much about the precision of these guns. The distances should be 15 meters (if you insist on close range testing) and 25 meters. That would be more appropriate I believe. [/quote]\nIMHO, bore or caliber of a handgun does not effect the accuracy of a handgun. A well made .22 LR can be far more accurate than a mediocre 9x19 para or .45 ACP. We all know that most accurate guns that we see in the shooting world come in .22 LR or in .32 ACP / S&W. (Pardini, Hammerli, Walther GSP Expert etc). It is the barrel quality, slide to frame fitting, sighting radius, quality of ammo, quality of trigger, quality of sights etc that effect the accuracy of the handgun, directly or indirectly. :) \n\nThe second thing is that I have devised a standard test for all handguns, which may not be the brightest idea, nevertheless, is easy to implement. If we intend to achieve perfection, we will have to carry out different tests for competition, combat and conceal carry handguns because their requirement for use is different. Would it be possible for us?   \n\n\n\n[quote=MKKD]Gilani sb, kindly also share why the scores for grouping are only taken for 15 shots and not all 30? Taking scores for only 15 shots raises the overall percentage score as the denominator becomes 450 intead of 600. Thank you for bearing with my long posts and I look forward to your responses. [/quote]\nI agree. Ideally speaking, all groups should be considered and a mean should be taken. I am considering the best group formed from that particular distance (in case of two tests), only because it is less time consuming for me. I am already giving lot of my time to this thread because members show lot of interest in it and I feel obligatory to give my input on regular basis. However, if I get time I will include all the group results and update the overall results. \n\nregards :)', ''),

Things done in private defence:\nNothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.\n \n97.	Right of private defence of the body and of property:\nEvery person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in Section 99, to defend;\nFirst: 	His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body;\nSecondly: 	The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.\n \n98.	Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.:\nWhen an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act which he would have if the act were that offence.\nIllustrations\n(a) 	Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence, but A has the same right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.\n \n(b) 	A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. Here Z by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception.\n \n \n99.	Act against which there is no right of private defence:\n\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which dose not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under colour, of his office, though that act may not be strictly justifiable by law.\n\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which dose not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law.\n\nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities.\n	Extent to which the right may be exercised:\n	The right of private defence in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.\n \n\n    Explanation 1 :A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is such public servant. \n\n    Explanation 2: A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if deemed. \n\n \n100.	When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death:\nThe right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:--\nFirst: 	Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;\nSecondly: 	Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;\nThirdly: 	An assault with the intention of committing rape;\nFourthly: 	An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust.\nFifthly: 	An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abduction.\nSixthly: 	An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for his release.\n \n101.	When such right extends to causing any harm other than death:\nIf the offence be not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body dose not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but dose extend, under the restrictions mentioned in Section 99 to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.\n \n102.	Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body:\nThe right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues.\n \n103.

Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that romantic dinner. \n\nMen aged 12 to 19 think about sex at least once every five minutes.\n\nThere are approximately 100 million acts of sexual intercourse each day.\n\nSex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain. \n\nEvery year, 11,000 Americans injure themselves while trying out bizarre sexual positions.\n\nSex is an instant cure for mild depre**ion. It releases endorphins into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being. \n\nHumans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.\n\nHomosexuality is not unique to humans: Many species have been observed engaging in homosexual activity; and male bats have the highest rate of homosexuality in all mammals.\n\nThe more sex you have, the more sex you want—this is especially true for women—as it raises testosterone levels.', ''),

(113831, ' [quote=alisyed]An interesting item to note is that [b]the conception that the longer the barrel the more accurate the gun do not entirely hold true.[/b] Similar to digital cameras mega pixel myth ie the more the better. Although the top full size guns will perform better than the top compact ones, but its not necessary that any full size will out perform a compact in accuracy[/quote]\nThat''s absolutely right Syed sahib and a very important aspect that must be kept in mind.\n \n[b]One distinct advantage that a longer barrel gives is the longer sight radius which assists a firer in shooting accurately.[/b] But that longer sight radius is hardly of any use if the quality of the barrel, quality of the trigger, slide to frame fit, quality of sights or quality of ammo is not good. And that is why you see a local pistol with 5 inch barrel performing lower than a small size Makarov which has a barrel almost 1.5 inches smaller.\n\nAs brother MKKD has pointed out, use of a machine rest would, to a great extent, eliminate all other factors except quality of barrel, slide to frame fitting and ammo. But whenever a human being would fire, factors like trigger, grip, sights etc would again come in.\n\nOur belief that a sub-compact size gun may not be that accurate is not therefore entirely true. A well made sub-compact gun with high quality barrel, good slide to frame fitting and smooth trigger may still be quite accurate, though it suffers from inherent disadvantage of a smaller sight radius :)', ''),

This chart may be eliminated. \n\n[quote=SA]2) The Bar Charts are self explanatory, however, it would be appropriate to take the average of same gun tested multiple times.[/quote]\nAgreed again, but only if it has been tested by the same firer and if the testing method adopted is the same. Mean of results of two different firers may not give us a true picture in many cases. Similarly, if the testing method has been different, again we can not compare these results hence taking its average may not be correct. \n\n[quote=SA]3) Three Bar Charts, in my opinion, would be sufficient for each of the three category of handguns:\n\n     a) Precision Shooting Results\n     b) Grouping Score\n     c) Overall Score[/quote]\nFully agreed. \n\n\n\nI would further add that if we [b]put all three of these factors in the same chart, it may become more wholesome[/b].

Most of us already know how a Makarov looks like and there are already many pics of Makarov in this and other threads. Posting pics of a handgun without a purpose is not worth the effort, IMHO. \n\nThat means I must write a detail review and comment on practical aspects of Makarov. A review without firing results is of very less utility because most of other information like pics, specification, features, price etc are already available on the internet :D I must therefore share my practical experience about the handgun hence waiting for ammo :)\n\nregards', ''),

Foster slugs are made of pure lead that is solid in front and hollow in the rear.\n\nExternal "rifling" cast onto these Foster type slugs; to allow the air they flew through, a slow spin that would help stabilizes the slug. It also provides some space for some compression if the slug had to squeeze through a tight choke.\n\nI have fired Lee, Lyman and Foster Slugs in local made slide action without any problem.

(113906, ' Absolutely right, Mr Denovo. A machine rest will allow us to gauge the potential accuracy of the firearm in question, but it will not show how accurate a shooter can be be that particular weapon.\n\nA much more reliable test would be to have a number of people, say five, shoot a particular gun in the same course of fire. An average of the scores will give us better overall results, than just one shooter testing the guns (No offense Mr Gilani :)).\n\nUnfortunately, given the existing ammo prices, such a test in not very feasible... maybe in the future, if and when ammo prices drop, we can consider such a test.', ''),

The best thing I like about true bulbs is that whatever you sow in this season, so will you reap in the next (in true bulbs, flower bud forms in side the bulb a season earlier and if it has not, a true bulb will not flower).

(113949, ' Moving forward on practical uses of snap caps, lets bring back parts of our earlier discussion where we said we can practice: [i](while strictly adhering to the safetly framework outlined above)[/i]\n\n[b]1- Administratively loading and unloading our weapon:[/b]\nBringing it to battery. Bringing it to chambered, decocked for holstering or unloading for storing. In practicing this, I find that for people who get minimal range time, we can do this safely at home with similar fidelity to doing it with real ammo on the range. We can critically observe ourselves doing it many times in order to establish and ingrain best practices when dealing with ammo and gun\n\n[b]2- Simulating malfunctions and clearing them:[/b]\nThere is a link to an excellent article in our ''Know your guns'' section dealing with malfunction clearance in general. Here let me focus specifically on malfunctions we can create using snap caps safely in our homes and practice clearing drills. These are:\n1. A type 4 malfunction. A stove pipe FTE\n2. A type 1 malfunction where there is a double feed\n\nLets see these drills below', ''),
(113950, ' Routing this deeply in our safety practices, lets start with a clear weapon pointed downrange:\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Malfunction%20clearance/DSC_0127.jpg[/img]\n\nWe''ll cock the trigger to release some pressure from the slide, while we hold it back just enough to clear a path into the chamber. We''ll do this with one hand so that with the other we can appropriately place a snap cap on the ejection port and ease the slide on to it\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Malfunction%20clearance/DSC_0128.jpg[/img]\n\nWe will now insert the magazine in the well and seat it firmly (the picture below doesn''t show the mag seated, but is on the way to) This is a stove pipe situation\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Malfunction%20clearance/DSC_0129.jpg[/img]\n\nFrom here, the drill is:\n1- Start with safety off, weapon pointed downrange and attempt to fire. The trigger is free because the gun is out of battery owing to the slide not being all the way forward\n2- Tap to seat. Rack the slide to clear/load, reacquire target and fire one shot only (because only this shot will be SA and subsequently the trigger will reset to DA. We cannot validly proceed with this drill unless we''re assuming this round was a dud too and do another tap, rack to simulate clearing an FTF. This is limiting)\n3- Survey the surrounds and follow your procedure to reholster. Drill ends!\n\nThe need for actual range time with real ammo is apparent', ''),

(113952, ' That was the stove pipe situation above.\n\nNow lets create the SHTF-scary double feed scenario and clear it.

This is a feedway stoppage - or a double feed. Perhaps only in this case, you DON''t want to slam the slide forward. One day you might be doing this with real ammo on the range and you don''t want the nose of one round slamming into the next one, purely for safety reasons, whether or not setting it off is a significant possibility.\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Malfunction%20clearance/DSC_0135.jpg[/img]\n\nFrom here, the drill is:\n1- Start with safety off, weapon pointed downrange and attempt to fire. The trigger is free because the gun is out of battery\n2- Tap, rack (flip). As soon as you rack you realize the weapon didn''t clear because there is a feedway stoppage\n3- You quickly move to the next part of the drill where you pull the magazine out (yank it if need be) and hold it between the pinky and ring finger of the firing hand (there is a possibility that the double fed round will fall through the mag well, but maybe not)\n4- Rack the slide with fervour three times to clear all stoppages\n5- Insert the magazine and then Tap, Rack, reacquire target and fire one shot only\n6- Survey the surrounds and follow your procedure to reholster. Drill ends!\n\nAll through the drill till step 5 above, the weapon should be pointed downrange', ''),

HOW TO INSTALL THE SAFE WITH THE SECURITY CABLE:  \n 1 Run small cable loop around fixed object. E.g. seat track of car, plumbing pipe in hotel room or bed frame. \n2 Push large loop over the latching bracket on the bottom half of the safe (remove foam if needed) and place cable in the notch in the side of the bottom half. \n3 The safe is now ready to secure your property or remain in place until you are ready to use it. Out of sight is out of mind! \n\nHOW TO USE THE SAFE: \n1 Retrieve the safe from under your seat (or other hidden location). \n2 Unlock the safe and insert (or remove) your gun/valuables. \n3 You can now secure your gun and enter the location where you are not legally allowed to carry a gun (retrieve your gun to start carrying your gun again). \n\n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVviYAi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/viYAi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsdQQtA][img]http://s2.postimage.org/dQQtA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVvj2zA][img]http://s4.postimage.org/vj2zA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\ni think that if some one wana buy this , then u can find it at tayabally lucky star.', ''),

It was well explained by brother anthrax in his tutorial video on youtube, but to pin point the problem here are a few more pics:\n\nIn the first pic you see the ''Firing Pin Safety Pin'' jutting out of the slide:\n[img]http://i791.photobucket.com/albums/yy197/Mangloo/CF98/DSC_6525_resize.jpg[/img]\n\nWhat happens sometimes is that when you are sliding the Slide back in its position, this pin gets stuck with the ''firing lever'' (shown below) and resists the slide from completely coming to its original position.\n[img]http://i791.photobucket.com/albums/yy197/Mangloo/CF98/DSC_6526_resize.jpg[/img]\n\nThe method to forward is described in Anthrax''s video; Just push the ''Firing Pin Safety Pin'' through the magazine way with a narrow long screw driver or the tool provided in the CF98 box, and the slide will be set free! \n\nHere''s what it looks like from the bottom side of grip or magazine way! Notice the ''Firing Lever'' in contact with the ''Firing Pin Safety Pin''!\n[img]http://i791.photobucket.com/albums/yy197/Mangloo/CF98/DSC_6531_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n\nIn my opinion, weapons should not require such tweaks for field stripping, but I think that after firing a few hundred rounds this problem might eliminate!\nSome other member having done that maybe in a better position to comment on this aspect.\n\nRegards', ''),

Berettas, Glocks, Sigs, PTs, CZ999, NP22 etc can again be quickly disassembled and assembled. \n\nI only wonder that if one has to disassemble a CF98 due to some reason in the field area and this safety stucks, and one does not have a thin long object at that time to press the damn thing than what would one do :rolleyes:', ''),

I was bothered with the [b]very heavy trigger pull [/b]of this new Glock19 as compared to my Glock17.. the heavy trigger didn''t affect my accuracy from 10 & 15 meters but it did affect from 20 meters, as I was hitting standard size bricks from 10 & 15 meters but was unable to hit the same target from 20 meters..worth mentioning here is that I was able to hit the same target quite easily from 20 meters with my [b]Browning Pro-9[/b], which I had returned it few weeks before in exchange for this Glock19 and which has the same barrel length ie 4".. also I was hitting the same target quite easily from 20 & 30 meters with my Glock17 which has a lighter trigger pull than this Glock19..\n\nWondering about the heavy trigger pull I stripped the gun open and noticed that the firing pin spring is [b]blue[/b] as compared to the[b] silver [/b]one in my Glock17.. I also noticed that the firing pins of both Glock17 & 19 are almost identical lenghtwise and otherwise, so I put the silver firing pin in Glock19 and was amazed to see that the trigger pull was reduced quite alot and the accuracy was also improved dramatically as I was hitting the same target from 20 meters, which I couldn''t before..\n\nHere are pictures of both firing pins with their springs.\nLeft. Silver firing pin... right. Blue firing pin\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVxoRc9][img]http://s4.postimage.org/xoRc9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nLeft blue spring... right silver spring\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVxp0aJ][img]http://s4.postimage.org/xp0aJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nSo finally I presumed that for self defence situations and in cases of a round in the chamber the blue firing pin spring is ideal and for target practice, the Silver spring is the choice.. ofcourse with the passage of time and with more practice, it will become easier for me to improve my accuracy with heavy trigger pull of this blue spring.. \n \nAll the [b]experienced expert members[/b] to comments please.. :)', ''),

In a regular draw, there are no problems, however the retention ensures that the gun cannot be removed from awkward angles. Before use, the tension screw had to be adjusted, otherwise, the gun would go in but not come out easily.\n\nThe holster (the one for the PT609) is actually quite comfortable; one can wear it all day and get used to the weight easily. However, a word of advice: this holster may be a little uncomfortable while driving.\n\nIf you get a Fobus for your Taurus, be sure that you [b]do not[/b] get one which is for the old (first-generation) Millennium model.', ''),

(114351, ' fahad sahib, \nFirst of all I compared a .45ACP with .380 ACP (9x17 Browning Short) and not with 9x19 parabellum which is a much more powerful round whereas .380 ACP is probably the weakest of all 9mm rounds. \n\nThe effective range of a handgun is the max range achieved by the bullet without effecting the accuracy, ie, the accuracy of the gun is maintained till that range. It is not to be mixed up with the max range that a bullet can reach. So I was surprised to see that a relatively weak ammo like .380 ACP fired from 4 inch barrel had a much greater range (80 m) than a much more powerful .45 ACP fired from 128 mm barrel. :|\n\nAs regards the max effective range, it depends mainly on two things in my view. \n-  First is the ammo. The amount of propellant charge contained in the cartridge is the main thing though size and shape of bullet also have an effect. Simply put, more the propellant charge, more the energy produced, more the chamber pressure and more the MV. This all, aided by an appropriately sized bullet for that pressure (neither too big nor too small) results in achieving more effective range. \n\n-  Now if we fire the same ammo from a 3 inch barrel pistol and than with a six inch barrel pistol, we will see that range achieved by the same ammo from a longer barrel is more. A longer barrel allows optimum pressure to be built and imparts adequate spin on the bullet through the rifling which results in more effective range. Again, if the barrel length is increased too much, the optimum pressure would start decreasing after a certain time and the range would start reducing from that point onwards. \n\nI could not find any data on this but I found it odd that a .380 ACP round fired with 100 MM barrel pistol had much more effective range than a .45 ACP fired from a 128 MM barrel pistol. Mind you we are talking of effective range here. \n\nNow the Sight Radius which is simply the distance between the front site tip and the rear site. In normal 1911s with 5 inch barrel, total length is 220-225 mm and sight radius is generally 165-175 mm, depending on different models. I found it odd that a 222 mm long 1911 had a sight radius of 157 mm, which is a little less. \n\nLonger sight radius tremendously helps in accurate shooting. \nMy two cents  :)', ''),

(114396, ' I think I''ve figured out why the problem was coming in the first place.\n\nIf we try to put the slide back without the procedure described my Mitho Sb, what will happen is that the hammer will be fully forward, and while the slide is being brought into its position, the hammer comes in contact with the firing pin first.\n\nThis puts some pressure on the firing pin, which in turn gives resistance to the Firing Pin Safety and it does not move easily, while being acted upon by the Firing Lever.\n\nIf we engage the safety and then disengage it, the hammer will be some what at half cock position. So when assembling the gun back, the slide does not come in contact with the hammer, rendering no pressure on Firing Pin. Hence the Firing Pin Safety can freely travel when it will come in contact with the Firing Lever!\n\nI hope I''m right! :/  \n\nP.S.

My comment was related to comparison of  .380 ACP (9x17 Browning Short) with .45 ACP and not of 9x19 parabellum with .45 ACP. \n\nI have gone through the Yavuz16 site again and now I find it full of errors. Like the MV for .380 ACP in MC25 and for 9x19 Parabellum in case of MC21 is same, ie, 363 m/s which comes to 1191 ft/s. How is this possible? 9x19 parabellum is a much more powerful round than 9x17 Browning Short / .380 ACP. There are many other errors also. I hope the standard of the Yavuz16 weapons is better than the quality of information available on their website. :lol:\n\nNow coming to your data quoted above refers to 9x19 parabellum whereas I am talking about .380 ACP. Moreover, you have quoted a +P+ ammo from 9x19 para which obviously is a very hot load and will have more range and much higher MV than a standard .45 ACP. \n\nHowever, MV of a standard .380 ACP is roughly 290 m/sec or 950 ft/s when fired from a standard 4.5 inch barrel. (Please note that with the change in size of barrel, MV will also change. ie, MV of the same .380 ACP round when fired with a 3 inch barrel pistol would be less than 950 ft / sec and from 5 inch barrel would be more than 950 ft/sec). \n\nThe standard FMJ loads of the common calibers in 9mm and .45 ACP would have following characteristics (data taken from internet);\n\n-  [b].380 ACP or 9x17 Browning Short or 9x17 Kurz or 9x17 Corto[/b]\n   Wt.......6.16 gms or 95 grains (wt of bullet not cartridge)  \n   MV....... 950 ft / sec (with standard 4.5 inch barrel)\n   ME.......260 joules (Muzzle energy)\n\n-  [b]9x18 Makarov[/b]\n   Wt.......6.16 gms or 95 grains    \n   MV....... 1033 ft / sec (with standard 4.5 inch barrel)\n   ME.......302 joules (Muzzle energy)\n\n-  [b]9x19 Parabellum[/b]\n   Wt.......7.45 gms or 115 grains   \n   MV....... 1118 ft / sec (with standard 4.5 inch barrel)\n   ME.......460 joules (Muzzle energy)\n\n-  [b].45 ACP (11.43x23 mm)[/b]\n   Wt.......14.9 gms or 230 grains   \n   MV....... 902 ft / sec (with standard 4.5 inch barrel)\n   ME.......563 joules (Muzzle energy)\n\nNow how much would be the [b]effective range[/b] of MC25 firing standard .380 ACP load and that of M1911 firing a standard .45 ACP, will have to checked by firing. I have all my doubts in Yavuz 16 data. (Mind you I am talking of effective range and not just range which is, in my view, of not any value.)\n\nI hope I have not made the things more complicated. :) \n\nMy only concern was that if there are so many errors in the website of a company (which certainly speaks of their seriousness / quality control) than how would be the standard of weapons of that company? Just a feeling, otherwise Yavuz may be making very good weapons and on internet, its just not difficult to prove it :)\n\nThanks for your time :)', ''),

Parts specially barrels of most local and few imported TTs are not quality / precision machined and metallurgy is also questionable. This actually holds good for any handgun and not TT alone. In my view, it is substandard construction of TT parts which causes problems / inaccuracies. Otherwise, there is no significant inherent problem with the design and a well made TT with improved sights and grips is a very fine pistol to have. Zastava TT and Winamax TT are well made TTs but they also need to have better quality sights and more comfortable grips :)\n\nThere is no inherent problem with 7.62x25 mm round also. Its an accurate and high MV ammo. However, the fake local ammo is not of satisfactory quality from both accuracy and gun safety point of view. \n\nI sometimes thinks of buying a Zastava TT in SS finish and get it customized by getting quality wooden grips with a thumb rest and adjustable sights or top quality fixed sights on it.

Ka_Khan\n6. Kamranwali\n7. Pistol\n8. Aquarius\n9. Muhammad\n10. MKKD\n\nDr. Inamullah was kind enough to invite me to his house, upon my request of a followup meeting. So I met him on Friday to discuss the modalities of range operations/management mainly including membership, safety and security, facilities, services, resources etc. We also discussed the future of Peshawar Gun Club and how we can make efforts for it to become a sustainable institution and function in a positive manner contributing to the sport of markshanship. As shared before, the idea is to start the Club at a smallscale, even if there are no shooting facilities made available immediately and on a standardised procedure. After key members have gotten together, we can then make collective efforts towards establishing the club in a formal manner. Once these initial discussions about the feasibility and regulations of the project are complete, we will be arranging a meeting of all members that we can gather information on in the coming days. That meeting will give us the opportunity to meet one another, form the community and discuss the future of the sport for this community in general in the context of the national, regional and international status of this sport. It should be interesting :)\n\nIn parallel, I am also exploring the possibility of having a meeting arranged with the provincial minister of sports and perhaps the DIG Frontier Corps. The former shouldn''t be a big issue, however, due to the ongoing geo-political and security conditions, the DIG/IG FC might be hard to reach these days. A meeting with the provincial home department will also be required some time soon. In the current situation, we will need to get these authorities on board if we want range facilities that are conveniently and easily accessible to all members. It''s a big challenge, but if we all put our hands and heads together, I''m sure we''ll get some results...\n\nPlease feel free to share your views and thoughts about the progress and approach.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDurrani.', ''),

(114919, ' [quote=Omer571]Well done bro. Btw what score makes you Master and Grand Master? Better tell me from D to Grand Master \nThanks[/quote]\n\nThe classification process begins with a whole bunch of courses of fire ("stages") which are set up exactly the same way and shot the same way whenever the stage is shot.  USPSA keeps track of each of the scores and all shooters are graded on a curve according to the best it was ever shot.  \n\nAn example of one is the classifier "CM 08-03 ''Six''"  There is a target on the left which is partially obscured with "hard cover" (the black area) as if the target was behind a wall.  Two falling steel targets in the center, one is the small USP the one behind is the larger "Pepper Popper,"  and then a target on the right, also partially obscured with hard cover.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsou10J][img]http://s2.postimage.org/ou10J.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe shooter has his gun loaded in his holster but is facing away from the targets.  On the start signal he turns, draws and shoots the targets, usually two on the left target, small steel, large steel, and two on the right target.\n\nI did it in 3.18 seconds and scored a perfect 30 pnts.  USPSA figures the "Hit Factor" by dividing the score by the time (the Hit Factor is the same as "points earned per second").  My hit factor ws 30/3.18 =  9.4340.  This was a score that was 98% of the best score [u]ever[/u] shot on this course of fire.  I figure the best ever done was a Hit Factor of 9.6000 or 30 pnts in about 3.13 seconds.   Which means the difference between me and the best ever fired was only 0.05 seconds.\n\nThis pattern of shooters shooting these classifiers and having their scores compared to the best score ever done repeats every thime a classifier is shot.\n\nThen USPSA classifies the shooters based on the the average of the best 6 (of the last 8 scores) submitted.\n\nGM = 95-100%\nM = 85-94.9%\nA = 75-84.9%\nB = 60-74.9%\nC = 40-59.9%\nD = 39.9% or less\n\nIf my calculation is correct, my average should soon be 86.167%', ''),

This is a feedway stoppage - or a double feed. Perhaps only in this case, you DON''t want to slam the slide forward. One day you might be doing this with real ammo on the range and you don''t want the nose of one round slamming into the next one, purely for safety reasons, whether or not setting it off is a significant possibility.\n\n\n\nFrom here, the drill is:\n1- Start with safety off, weapon pointed downrange and attempt to fire. The trigger is free because the gun is out of battery\n2- Tap, rack (flip). As soon as you rack you realize the weapon didn''t clear because there is a feedway stoppage\n3- You quickly move to the next part of the drill where you pull the magazine out (yank it if need be) and hold it between the pinky and ring finger of the firing hand (there is a possibility that the double fed round will fall through the mag well, but maybe not)\n4- Rack the slide with fervour three times to clear all stoppages\n5- Insert the magazine and then Tap, Rack, reacquire target and fire one shot only\n6- Survey the surrounds and follow your procedure to reholster.

Unfortunately, It is common in the world, and  most debilitating. It is known as a destroyer of mankind, robbed the very essence of young lives and leave them disable until death. None of the illness is more tragic and disabling than schizophrenia . The young men and women in their twenties are its victims, sometimes even younger people succumb to this horrible illness of the mind.\n	After  3000 years, we still do n’t know exactly what causes schizophrenia. Has no cure and treatment is the most difficult.  we can control the symptoms., but  science can not control detracting effects of this disease.  It is not just one disease but multiple abnormalities cling together.  We know that it runs in the family and it is true chemical dopamine excess abnormality in the brain. It is not just a psychiatric illness but medical and physical illness. \n	Contrary to our myth, schizophrenia can not be created due to stress, studying of Psychology or some other source. It is in the gene of the family and  in a generation someone will become its victim. Schizophrenia is true illness of the mind and body. Schizophrenic patients are not that dangerous as it once were considered but only when they are frightened, they will harm other to protect themselves and if  only paranoid type .\n            There are four kinds of schizophrenia: 1) Paranoid  2) Catatonic  3) disorganized and 4) Undifferentiated type. Basic symptoms are false fixed ideas (Delusion), Hallucinations (False perceptions) or misinterpretation of reality that can not be changed. Speech is incoherence, insight is non existence (patient never accepts that he/she is ill), suicide is common about 10 % will kill themselves. Extremely disorganized behavior, gait  and posture;  has no aim, no planning, poor speech and flat mood is hallmark of this illness.\n	Besides, schizophrenics impose a great burden on the family and as it is said , “ 10-14 people around schizophrenic will be adversely effected.”. Anger, anxiety, depression, and hopelessness in the family members are common effects of patient’s sickness. Patient become totally dysfunctional. Ability to study, work, socialization and self care is totally impaired.', ''),

Ok, you had a bad experience, we all do, but then let''s not generalize and use words like "[b]they[/b] would polish ur shoes as well as eat dog food".\n\nYou narrated your experience. Allow me to narrate mine.\n\nSome years back I had a brawl / scuffle with four guys aged in their 30s and 40s. (A one on four free style). We all got hurt and all left the scene of incident on our feet. Fourteen days later I get a call on my cell from an ASI of the PS of the area where the incident took place, informing me in a very respectful tone that an FIR against me (and my father and my 13 year old brother) has been lodged and that I should visit the PS. It turned out that all four of them were claiming fractures on different parts of their body and they had MLO Certificates to prove that too. On paper, they had a strong case. \n\nKhair, once I reached the PS, the ASI there questioned me and upon hearing my side of the story, advised me to get pre-arrest bail first thing next morning, which we did. Then came in the I/O (an SI rank officer) and he too turned out to be a gem of a person. The case continued, we got ourselves a good criminal lawyer who grilled the complainants, shred their case to pieces and in the end we were acquitted. In fact, at the end of it, we had a counter case against them which brought them squealing and begging for forgiveness. During this whole while, the experience we had with our Police personnel was very cooperative, honest and satisfactory. \n\nEven when after the acquittal, I went to the I/O to give him some money as a gesture of appreciation, he refused to take it. I had to buy and TCS him a gift to make him accept it which he acknowledged on phone. It''s been four years now and he still calls us up every Eid to wish us.\n\nAnd during this whole sordid affair, no hi-fi contacts were used.\n\nSo, ofcourse, we do have bad eggs in our Police Department, but then we have them in all departments, in all castes, in all races, in all religions, in all ethnicities, in every country and in every city. Doesn''t mean we start generalizing by using harsh words.\n\nJust thought I should contribute with my two cents.', ''),

Took old news papers with us as my father wanted us to have an idea about the spreading of pellets. That''s an experience I cherish to date. \nSecond time around, it was on the way to Fort Munroe from DGKhan. My cousins were around and we had our very own private range in the mountains. I was introduced to automatic weapons for the first time. The yr was 1992 and I was 15. Had a crush on MP5. Just fell in  love with that weapon. G3 and AK47 were a delight too.

All thanks to him for inculcating the same respect in me and my brother .[/quote]\n\nYou''re lucky bro.\n\nMy first time was with a .22 revolver at the age of 8 at Halaji Lake during a fishing-cum-outing with family members.

I told him that my friend is from abroad and doesnt know anything and if he is lost, i''m in deep $hit and his mother would probably rip my head off.\n\nunderstanding the urgency of the situation, the guy called every single policeman to the scene and the whole bazar was practically storming with cops in minutes. the frantic search continued till late evening but he was not found. keep in mind there was no paperwork, no formal request was filed and the policemen were not under any obligation (atleast documentary obligation) yet they cooperated the fullest degree.\n\nI went back home practically shedding tears all the way, totally dishearten, shattered and dreading the moment when I face his parents.\n\nto my shock, when I went to his place, he was there sipping tea. when I asked: WTF man, what happened? he replied, dude, I lost ya, so I thought why not go back home instead of our rendezvous point, it more convenient. WTF ?\n\nI gave him a beautiful, perfectly timed uppercut right on his chin, knocked him out cold for the next two days. tough love :) SOB almost gave me a freakin'' heart attack.\n\nmoral of the story: the policeman truly displayed remarkable civil service attitude.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I stopped and showed the guy my service card. the guy very politely said, "Sir, i''m alone here in the dark and in the middle of nowhere and kinda scared $hitle$$ at the moment. would you be kind enough to spend a few minutes talking.

(115263, ' [quote=TT-33]All over the world why do people like Glock , & give preference to it on others?[/quote]\n\nAccuracy,reliability, light weight and most of  all the safest and completely fumble free is what makes the Glock as the most wanted pistol.\nThose who have had the chance of drawing their gun in anger will understand what I am saying. There are recorded incidents of the Beretta safety being applied when the slide was raked in anger and the gun de cocked, (a problem common in all pistols which have safeties on the slide); of magazines falling out from other makes of guns.\n \nA Glock is completely safe with a round in the chamber as it is only partially cocked and the cocking is complete only when the trigger is squeezed to fire. Also if one does not want to carry a rd in the chamber a Glocks slide is the smoothest and fastest as there is no hammer cocking glitch.\nAt 19 t0 21 ounces it is one of the lightest pistols in its class, and when you want to carry it endlessly day after day it makes the biggest difference.\nIts Tennifer coated (hard as a diamond) Slide and hard barrel are virtually maintenance free as it does not rust or stain or scratch no matter how neglectful one is.\nI bought my first one in 1984 the first generation green in colour, from then on I have been hooked to Glock and never without  one till now, although I have been changing the guns; as while in service, for almost 4 years one of my jobs was in the R&D on small arms  and ammo, so i fired countless rds through my Glocks of 9mm Mk 2Z without a hitch or hiccup.', ''),

(115274, ' I want to add the Glocks slide is built like a tank, it is the heaviest, if one compares with any other pistol of same class.\nThis is  what gives it minimal barrel rise on firing and minimal  FELT recoil as the heavy slide soaks up the jump and recoil and the polymer frame has "give" in it as it flexes with recoil; but then one must have a positive wrist ( not limp ). Other polymer frame pistols are solid like alloy frames, only Glock has the lightest frame with the recoil absorbing ability.\n\nThe trigger pulls are not ideal ( this is not meant for Target shooting) and vary from 5 lbs to 12 lbs as per requirement, if you remove the slide you can see a + or ++ marks denoting whether the pistol has a 5 lbs or heavier trigger as per requirements of police departments ordering these pistols. \nBy the way over here some friends have installed after market triggers which give it a crisp 2 lbs trigger and have won first positions in matches but these triggers disconnect the Firing Pin Block and inter fare with the completely safe pistols safety mechanism.\nSuch an altered trigger can lead to a SLAM FIRE  etc\nMy Glock has a very prominent position in my collection, it is like the wife you sleep with, when you have more.

(115316, ' Asalamualaikum everyone,\n\nOur forum is Alhamdolillah growing fast, both in terms of members and posts/topics. However, it is important that we ensure that this growth does not take a toll on the quality and environment of our forum and with this in mind, I wish to re-iterate the following humble suggestions to all my brothers:\n\n1) New members are advised to take some time to look around, go through our different sections, use the search option as much as they want, get a feel of the environment and then take a dip at the deep-end (i.e., start posting or opening new topics);\n\n2) Be careful while opening new threads and posting queries and ensure that similar thing / query has not been discussed before. The search option comes in handy here.\n\n3) Do not use multiple posts to say ''Welcome to PG'' to 12 new members who joined recently. Instead use a single post to welcome them all. You are not obligated to post in every thread so avoid posting +1 or +100 unnecessarily in a discussion of which you are not a part. Also, if you forget to add a detail to your previous post, use the "EDIT" function. Its sometimes disconcerting to see a chain of posts, one after the other, by just one member and gives the impression that the member in question is simply looking to increase his post count. Members who make unnecessary posts will face post count slashing, post deletion and can even be banned.\n\n4) This forum is English-based and as such we expect our members to communicate in clearly understandable English. Use punctuations and capital letters where necessary. Avoid using chat-style posts as these are really annoying and frustrating to read.\n\n5) We expect all members to know how to agree to disagree. Therefore, avoid getting personal or make personal attacks on any member during a discussion. Give respect to get respect.\n\n6) Neither your post count makes you a senior nor does the size of your gun collection makes you one. It is the level of contribution that you give to this forum that enhances your level in the eyes of our community.\n\n7) Do not copy/paste material from the internet unnecessarily. We all have access to the internet and know how to use google.\n\n8) For those who have not read these yet, please read our Forum Rules [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/misc.php?action=rules[/url] , a few words about Member Etiquettes [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=192[/url] and our Market Place rules [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4047[/url]\n\n9) If you see any offending material posted on the forum, please use the report icon appearing at the bottom of each post to bring the matter to our knowledge. The first thing to come to our notice each time we (Admin/Mods) log in are these reports. For urgent actions, most of our senior members who already have our contacts, may feel free to sms the issue to us.\n\n10) Do not dig up old threads/topics unless you have any thing meaningful to add to that topic.\n\nPlease note that PakGuns is not just an online forum, it is a ''community''. And the reason why this is so, is because of the environment which we have created with collective effort. Here, you will find people of all ages from diverse backgrounds and professions from different parts of the world on a single platform sharing their passion. From high-ranking serving Army Officers to finance professionals, from Squadron Leaders to A-level students, from Farmers to Entrepreneurs. You''ll find them all here in our community. It is therefore, that we have almost zero tolerance towards anything which threatens to have a negative impact on our forum''s environment.  \n\nAlthough most of the above points have already been covered previously during various discussions as well as in our Member Etiquettes and Rules related threads, however, I thought there was a need for this reminder.\n\n[u]Senior[/u] members are invited to please add to the above points as they feel necessary.', ''),

(115341, ' I have a suggestion which I believe may contribute to better organization of discussions on this forum. My idea is the simple "Divide and Rule"... the primary sections should be divided into sub-sections, for example, there can be a "Self-Defense/ Home Defense" sub-section in the "Club House" which would deal with matters related to that particular topic. Another example would be to divide the "Handguns" Section into sub-sections for the more common manufacturers. This will make searching through the forum for a particular topic much more easier, especially for those who may be unable to do so via the search engine.\n\nFurthermore, I second rizshu''s idea about closing old, inactive threads. Such a closed thread may be opened if a Mod/ Admin feels that further discussion on a previously forgotten topic may be fruitful.\n\nI''ve been on this forum for a year now, and I''ve noticed that every now and then, apparently senior members feel the need to go rogue... digging up dead threads being the most usual (and irritating) offense...\n\nA little advice to some members of this forum: if you forget to add a detail to your previous post, use the [b]"EDIT"[/b] function.

(115400, ' Concentrating too much, to an extent, where the shooters shoulders get stiffened, and body too, will let fatigue set in, which is a counter-productive element for a target shooter. That''s why the shot should break in within 5 to 7 seconds. While target shooting, relax and enjoy the whole activity. Let the heart, beat itself and then settle itself down prior to the actual competitive shots. I mean the first tip of Taurus to warm up means the same. So have some warm up shots. These will also make your gun''s bore otherwise to what is known as the Cold Clean Bore(Though applicable more to long guns). Don''t stiffen your shoulders and let them remain at their normal and lowered actual position while your arms are also not steel rigid. The slight bent in them at the elbow joint works as a shock and recoil absorber. Enjoy and let your heart smile and harmonize to the symphony of launching your bullet to the center of the target. Feet Shoulder width apart provide you a good center of gravity and equilibrium. I have felt that expanding the toes slightly outwards provide a better and stable platform to a shooter than kept straight to the target.(Personal experience and may vary)', ''),

(115613, ' you know what i am most excited about\ncompetition\nim waiting for another Exhibition shooter to come out so i can actually have competition with someone.\nits going to be so much more fun that way.\nevery second week he''ll put up a vid with a new trick and then ill try and do that trick. etc etc\nanyway\nso if anyone does come up or is interested here are the tricks that i have done up till now , and as i tell u all that i''ll even  give tips on how to actually do exhibition shooting.\n\nthe basic Exhibition shooting and the first step to learning this sport is.\n\n[b]Single skeet:[/b]\njust hold one skeet in your hand throw is high in the air , aim and shoot.\nnow in the beginnig u might want to use your left hand to throw the skeets while your gun is ready with the muzzle already pointing the sky. if your throwing from your left hand you''ll be throwing the skeet virtically (l \nFrom your right hand you''ll be throwing the skeet horizontally ---- \nNow remember\nwhen you''ve thrown the skeet and aiming \nAIM LOWER .\nat least 2 inches lower then the skeet. this way you will powder the skeet properly and not just chip it.\n\nOnce u get a hang of shooting one skeet try throwing it in different ways\nthrow it from your back,from over your head , on different hights , etc etc . play around , use your imagination.\n\nthen once your one skeet is purfect. pick up two then three then four \ni personally have done up till 5 Skeets. \n\n[b]Skeet on the Gun BUTT[/b]:\nnow this is fun\nput the skeet on the your shotgun''s Butt\nswing the gun in a way that the skeet gets thrown in the air and then shoot it.\n\n[b]Gun upside down over the head[/b]:\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVP9sxi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/P9sxi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Gun upside dowm from the hips[/b]:\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsw4z_r][img]http://s2.postimage.org/w4z_r.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Gun Unloaded[/b]:\nnow this is a fun trick. this trick will really improve your reflexes.\nin this you have to keep your gun unloaded and have 1 cartridge in your mouth.\nyou have to throw one skeet in the air , then load the gun , aim and then powder the skeet.\nplease remember. safety first . always have the berrel of the gun pointing at the sky or an area where there is no one.\n\n[b]Gun Behind your Back[/b]:\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxCOsJA][img]http://s1.postimage.org/COsJA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Gun on the ground[/b]:\nin this trick you''ll have one skeet in your hand and your gun on your foot,\nyou have to throw the skeet in the air and pull your foot up so that the gun jumps up for u to catch it and then shoot the skeet before it hits the ground. \n\nNow remember \nu can even join tricks\nlike imagin the gun on the ground trick + Gun unloaded.(just thought of it,,i will do it this sunday and u can see it in my videos)\n\n[b]Golf[/b]:\noh by the way i am actually a 14 HC Golfer. once i didn''t have skeets so i took a few golf balls with me.\nthen later on i found out Professional Exhibition shooter have actually used Golf balls. \nthis is not really a new trick but. its exploring and actually about just having fun. shoot your empty shells, vegtabels, fruits , golf or tennes balls, plates , paint cans , anything u can throw in the air. anything entertaining.\n\n[b]Air Ground Air[/b]:\nthis is the latest trick that i just nailed.\nits all about fast shooting.\nnow in this u are holding two skeets in your hand while u have placed another 1 skeet on the ground about 20 feet away from u .\nYou have to throw the two skeets in the air\nhit only one of those 2 skeets that are in the air.\nonce that one skeet is powderes you have to shoot that one skeet u placed on the ground\nafter that u have to shoot the 2nd skeet in the air before it hits the ground.\ni was so excited when i finally did this trick.\nnow, the next step of this trick is to just add skeets on the ground\nthis way you hit 1 air then 2 ground and then the 2nd air... and so on\n\nWell\nthats it for now\ni cant really think of any other trick that i have done.\ni hope i have helped u guys in some way\nif there are any questions i would be happy to answer.\nand if anyone one has a trick up on thier mind that they would want me to do\nplease share.\nmy vids are on youtube where u will find all these tricks being done by me.\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/user/Hamzahzahidkhan#g/a[/url]\n\ntake care

It''s primary purpose is to ensure that the rifle stays in place (fixed) while it is shot to check various things including but not limited to (i) accuracy of different ammo; (ii) zeroing of scope; (iii) gun maintenance / cleaning etc.\n\nHere''s an example of shooting rest from online sources\n\n[url]http://www.ctkprecision.com/ProductImages/p3usr1_03_600.jpg[/url][/quote]\n\n\nput a cam on the scope and a wire on the trigger to pull and u have an automated system..\n\ngot ur point :)', ''),

[b]Im talking about  a general situation here which would be hunting[/b].. If you are out hunting, you want your equipment to be as light as possible, thats why ppl pay thousands to replace ther stock for a lighter one.. since you mihgt have be on foot in the mountains or anywhere, u have to carry that thing around on ur back.. thats a lot of weight.. and if u spot a game, u would want to be on the ground in not time and ready to shoot.. imagine the time its gonna tkae to set that pod up..  on the other hand, if we are talking about practice shooting at a range, then its ok.. cuz u go there in ur car/jeep, so no worries abt weight on ur back, u aren''t worried for the game running away, so u have plenty of time to set it up..\n\nand yes, i could come up with a better solution but we have to talk abt the needs first.. :)[/quote]\n\n\nevilmaster bro, bench rests are never used in hunting, these are just to use at range, you see its "[b]BENCH[/b]  [b][i]REST[/i][/b]" not stick or bipod or tripod (which are used in hunting).\n\nRegarding the jack being a motor vehicle lifting device, since it lifts an heavy object like big cars so is quite usefull to make a bench rest with it where you need variated hights & smooth up/down movement and anything light in weight can loose its hieght with every shot fired.\nHope this will clear your concerns, and lets wait for brother shano to explain it more professionaly :)', ''),

I will get the pictures nxt time and ill upload them for sure... :)[/quote]\n\n\n\nMalik Imran,\n\nBrother thanks for reply. Congratulations to buy the workhorse, no doubt in it that Baikal \n\nMP 153 is a very good gun. In my poor opinion the most appropriate barrel lenth for a  \n\nhunting gun (for partridge and bird shoot) is 26 inchs, please correct me if I am wrong. 30 inch \n\nbarrel is difficult to connect quickly with object. 26 inch barrel with different chocks is good \n\nenough. Do your gun has the chocks option? I think there should be 3 chocks with your gun.\n\nAnyway do not bothered anything because all the calculation is correct, but when the hand \n\nonce set  on a gun there is nothing like that. Once again many congratulations.\n\nWe are not in hurry, so take your time to get the pictures and upload it with your \n\nconvenience. \n\nWISH YOU GOOD LUCK FOR EXAMS AND EVERY WALK OF LIFE. GOD BLESS YOU\n\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\n\n\nThanx alot bro .. Yea its a bit difficult to hunt down patridges with a 30 inch gun .. At start i had problem but then my hand got set on this gun.. Yes it has 3 chokes with it .. I usually hunt patridges with a 3point choke ... I am thinking of selling my russian O/A because its also 30inch and thinking of buying a 26inch O/A but I don''t knw how much would a new O/A 26inch cost and for how much would that 30inch one sell.. Kindly reply if u have any info about it.. Thanks alot  :)', ''),

(115988, ' Both MP446 Viking and Stoeger Cougar are very good handguns, amongst the best available in Pakistani market in sub 100k range. It''s up to the individual to select any one out of them, depending upon his personal liking and preference. \n\n-   [b]MP446 Viking[/b] is the civilian model of MP443 Garch which is the official sidearm of Russian army since many years now. The only difference between the two is that Garch has a steel frame and Viking has a polymer frame, otherwise they are same handgun. Garch was developed after a long period of trials and is successfully serving one of the biggest armies of the world. Just like Makarov (previous side arm of Russian Army), Garch also has something special about it. \n\n-   Garch / Viking is capable of firing very high pressure ammo, ie, 7N31 and 7N21. That is why you see such a ugly looking huge breach / chamber in Viking. It is designed to take 40,000-45,000 psi of chamber pressure with 7N31 and 7N21 rounds, which is far more than the capability of normal 9mm (around 35,000 psi). Though 7N31 and 7N21 are strictly military ammos and would perhaps never be available to us; nevertheless [b]it simply means that with a Viking, we can fire any kind of ammo with zero problems.[/b] It fires anything and everything. Viking, however, has the ugliest looks that one can come across in a modern handgun. For those whom looks matter (which includes most of us :) ), Viking is not a real attraction. However, [b]its tough, battle-worthy and reliable.[/b] \n\n-	Another good quality of Viking is its natural pointability. The moment one raises a Viking, [b]its balance, grip and sights help a shooter to aim it in a very quick time, just like a Steyer and Glock.[/b] This is a very very helpful trait in combat shooting. \n\n-	 [b]Stoeger Cougar[/b] is a very nice gun which has the manufacturing and finish of a top end gun. Is quite accurate for its size and has a mild recoil. Is very solidly built with a steel / alloy frame and is obviously much heavier than MP446 Viking.   \n\n-   Rotating barrel mechanism is known to have higher accuracy and lesser recoil (theoretically). In modern handguns, we find four handguns with rotating barrel mechanism, ie, Beretta PX4 Storm, Beretta Cougar 8000 (predecessor of PX4 Storm), Stoeger Cougar 8000 (which is an exact copy of Beretta Cougar, being manufactured on same Beretta plant by Stoeger in Turkey) and Norinco CF98. \n\n-   However, it has always intrigued me that why top manufacturers like Colt, H&K, Browning / FN Herstall, Sig Sauer, Walther, CZ, Smith & Wesson, Wilson Combat, Kimber, Steyer, Glock, etc, who spend so much on R&D, have not adopted this mechanism for their handguns????????  \n\n-   One possible reason that I experienced is that rotating barrel mechanism has an inherent disadvantage of the location of feed ramp which is not completely on the barrel / chamber (like other pistols) but is located on the connector (since barrel has to rotate during its backward and forward movement). It requires a precise alignment of connector (feed ramp) and the chamber (which also has a portion of feed ramp) every time the bullet is fed into the chamber. Any mis-alignment of the feed ramp would result in incorrect feeding of the bullet and a stoppage thereafter. This is my observation after firing around 500 rounds with 5 different Stoegers and around 3000 rounds with 6 different CF98s. I experienced 5-7 stoppages in Stoeger and over 25 in CF98 (don''t remember the exact number now). All of them occurred with POF, Chinese and Russian ammos (but I mostly fire these three ammos only :) ). Sometimes there is no stoppage in more than 200 -300 rounds. [b]These stoppages are not so frequent that one gets worried and starts calling his gun un-reliable. They are very occasional nevertheless they are still there.[/b] I perhaps experienced more stoppages because I fire a lot. Those who do not fire that much may not experience them for quite some time.  \n\n[b]With all said, I personally feel that both Viking and Stoeger, along with CZ999 and Taurus PT99 are the best available handguns in sub 100K range.

(116089, ' AoA Everybody\n\nkindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject. in my humble opinion, comparing Baikal MP446 Viking to a Stoeger Cougar is unjustified. from durability, Trigger, useful life, grip and reliability standpoint, Viking wins hands down whereas from finish, looks, smooth operation of the control levers and heritage (subjective) standpoint, Cougar has a clear edge. decide between the two on the basis of "whatever tickles your fancy".\n\nas far as the 2009 & 2010 make Vikings are concerned, I have a 2006 Viking and recently saw few 2010 make with AK47 bhai during our Peshawar trip a few days back. in my opinion, from construction point of view, Viking is pretty much the same (rough, tough and as durable as ever) whereas from finishing point of view, the standards have fallen drastically. the finishing was so rough that even the control levers (safety, mag release) were difficult to operate. to be honest, the mag release button looked as if it was cut using a blunt saw. this problem was not with a single piece but all the pieces in the shop were suffering from same issues hence it cannot be called as an isolated incident. the mag insertion was also not what I would call "smooth as silk".\n\nOther than that, the front cocking serrations added to the 2009-2010 Viking kinda gave the handgun a head-turning personality. this is probably the only feature I liked. otherwise the "lack of finishing issue" totally turned me off.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(116103, ' AoA Everybody\n\nkindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject. first of all, there is no minimum legal limit on the barrel length of a shotgun. you can go as short as you want. in most of the developed world, the minimum legal length is fixed at 18 inches an some countries/states it is 14 inches.\n\nas far as efficiency is concerned, modern propellants do not need more than 14 inches to fully burn out therefore technically there is no advantage of having a longer barrel. however, going below 14 inches of barrel length has plenty of disadvantages to make it "not worth pursuing" in my opinion.\n\n1. louder noise (bad for ears)\n2. higher flash (bad for eyes and stuff)\n3. higher kick (a big time tactical disadvantage)\n4. shorter sighting plane (you can easily miss the broad side of a barn)\n5. pattern starts opening up too quickly for any tactical advantage\n\nin my opinion, for a home defense shotgun, the minimum barrel length should be 21 inches or for a shotgun that gets carried alot, 18 inches should be the absolute minimum.\n\ncall me crazy but in my opinion any guy who carries a tactical shotgun is "pistol grip only" configuration is seriously compromising his firearm''s ability to be an effective man stopper. in any situation where a full length buttstock isn''t a viable option, a handgun should be employed. shotguns were never designed to be handy/nimble in the first place. thats the job of a handgun.\n\nin its proper configuration a shotgun offers the best "P.U.D." result of any firearm.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s.\n\nP.U.D. = "Pushing up Daisies" ;)', ''),

(116126, ' [img]http://pakistanguides.com/mount/gallery/images/photos/Yukshin_Gardan_Sar_North_Peak_7530.jpg[/img]\n\nThis is the north face of Mount Yukshin Gardan Sar (7530 Meters or 24698 Feet). This beautiful peak is located in Shimshal valley and it was the highest virgin (unclimbed) peak of the world until June 1984 when two teams A) Pakistan Austrian & B) Pakistan Japan joint expeditions climbed it respectively from its Southern Face. \n\nThere have been just three expeditions to this peak it its entire geological history. The first one attempted to climb it in 1974 under the leadership of Austrian climber Robert Shower .. but failed ! K2, Everest, Nanga Parbat, G1, GII, Broad Peak and all other prominent peaks were climbed one after the other as early as in early fifties, however, since this peak was the most difficult one on the face of the Earth, the climbers kept it pending till they finished climbing easier peaks around the world.\n\nWe started our expedition in the first week of May 1984 & headed towards its base camp with 90 porters (each carrying 25 kgs). It took us 8 days to reach its lower base camp and then we spent almost over a month in establishing various camps on this peak & finally attacked & conquered it on 26 June 1984 !\n \nUnfortunately, myself, one of my Pakistani colleagues Prof Rahat Ali Khan and two of our Japanese friends got seriously injured in an avalanche just four days before our team went for their final attempt so the four of us were left behind & we could not climb this majestic mountain. I & Rahat were bandaged & put to bed rest for over 15 days with intensive medical treatment from our Japanese friend. Our other Japanese friend, Dr. Shuruz lost both his eyes in this accident but when he went back to Japan, first he recovered eye sight of his one eye & a few months later, he also recovered his second eye. \n\nMajor Sher Khan was the first in our team to climb it followed by our Japanese friends Suzuki, Hanzawa & Hayakawa. \n\nTwo years later, while climbing on K2, Suzuki was blown by a sudden & powerful gust of wind and he came tumbling down the treacherous slope of this merciless mountain. He was just 300 meters away from the summit of K2. After an exhaustive search, his body could never be found but the only parts of his body that we found were his left foot excluding ankle (still in his boot), three fingers of his left hand & two ribs only ...!!! He was cremated & ashes taken to Japan where he was nationally honored.\n\nLast year, when I took one of my clients on a Blue Sheep Hunt to Shimshal Valley, I was so lucky to have seen this peak after 25 years. I was so very thankful to my Allah who gave me good health & I could walk all the way to this beautiful mountain & see it once again in my life. My feelings were beyond expression. The people of Shimshal hosted a grand reception for me. With the exception of just a very few, most of the old guys had died, the kids had become adults and those adults are now in fifties & sixties. \n\nMy mother used to ask me ... why do you stupid guys risk your life & climb mountains and what treasure do you get when you reach the summit of a peak ... And with all my knowledge ... & aesthetics ... I could never give her a satisfactory reply .. simply because I too ... never knew why have I been engaged in climbing all my life ?\n\nHowever, .... "NOW" when I see my collection of all those beautiful photos of these mountains, my brain "Replays The Action" I go into a pleasant syndrome as if I am physically there. And ... NOW  I think its a great asset & all that pain I took was worth it !\n\nThanks for sharing my crazy hobby !\n\nPS : There is an expedition and an untold story (so well preserved) behind each photo I made of these mountains.', ''),

The professor started the class by telling them, ''In Veterinary Medicine it is necessary to have two important qualities as a Doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the Animal body''. For an example, the Professor pulled back the sheet, touched his finger in the mouth of the dead pig, withdrew it and put his Finger in his mouth. ''Go ahead and do the same thing,'' he told his students.\n\nThe students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes. But eventually took turns putting their finger in the mouth of the dead pig and tasted in their mouth.\n\n\nWhen everyone finished, the Professor looked at them and said, ''The Second most important quality is observation. I touched with my middle Finger and tasted on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention\n\n \nMoral of the story:\n\nLife is Tough but its a lot tougher when you are stupid', ''),

(it can happen to anyone), u''ll have to apply for duplicate licenses for each weapon. and during the time lapse between u losing ur booklet and getting duplicate booklets for ur licenses, ur all three weapons will be grounded.\n\nmy advise would be to get three seperate booklets for three different weapons.\n\nRegards.', ''),

These are K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I, Gasherbrum II (also called G1 & G2) and Nanga Parbat.\n\n29 peaks over 7,500 meters and 101 peaks over 7,000 meters. Peaks between 4000-7000 meters are several hundreds. \n\n50 of the 100 highest peaks of the world are also in Pakistan.\n\nPakistan has the maximum number of valley glaciesr in the world. The World''s FIRST FIVE LONGEST VALLEY GLACIERS are also in Pakistan. They are Siachin (73 km), Biafo (63 Km), Baltoro (62 km), Hispar (52 km)  Batura (57 km). The junction of Biafo & Hispar Glaciers is the longest glacial corridor on Earth .. it is 115 km long river of frozen ice.\n\nLukpo Lawo (or Snow Lake) is the world''s largest & Concordia the second largest piedmont glaciers of the world.\n\nConcordia (Baltistan) is the only place on Earth which has a cluster of 16 tallest peaks of the world within just a short radius of 8 miles.\n\nIn Hunza alone, there are 100 peaks above 18000 feet ... this is more than the entire Alps.\n\nThe highest peak of Europe which is called Matterhorn (4477 Meters) is below the base camp of K2 where trekkers go camping.\n\nNanga Parbat is the highest peak to climb & Rakaposhi is the second highest peak to climb in the world. Almost all readers will question this claim of mine & reckon Mount Everest to be the highest but I''ll prove it how ? ... you''ll find it interesting ! Ifyou stay in touch ![/quote]\n\nNanga Parbat is 8125 Meters high & its base camp are 3000+ to 3200+ meters which means the actual climb from its base camps to its summit is 5125 meters to 4925 meters.\n\nSimilarly Rakaposhi is 7788 Meters & its base camps are also located at 3000+ to 3200+ meters which means its actual climb from its base camp to its summit is 4788 meters to 4588 meters\n\nWhereas, Mount everest is 8848 meters high & its base camps are at 5000+ meters so its actual climb from its base camp to its summit is 3848 meters which is 1277 meters to 1077 meters less than nanga Parbat & 940 meters to 740 meters less than Rakaposhi ... !!!! \n\nThis means both Nanga Parbat & Rakaposhi are higher than Mount everest !!!', ''),

(116355, ' [quote=Husnain Ali]thanks to all for so much info . Well know my first choice is VIKING.is t[b] But one thing is the frame can we say that [/b][b]he cause of price its going down day by day?[/b][/quote]\n\nCertainly not Husnain bro.. the decline in prices of new Viking is not due to the frame''s polymer material which is just similar to the older models (quite robust, rough and tough as older models).. the main reason is that every new comer to the market comes on the higher side of price, and after a certain period of time its prices starts declining eg the same very Baikal when came to the market was for arround 90K and just after a month its price reduced to 70K, still further to 60k and now you can get a NIB Viking for 50K.. I asked the similar question from a dealer that why Viking''s price has fallen from 90K to 50k, and he told me that as long as the import of pieces are smooth and unhindered and there are ample pieces available in the market to meet the demand of buyers, prices usually remains static or decreases because different dealers competes with one another in order to increase their sale and profit and by doing so they reduce the price of that specific item so that the number of buyers increases and they get more profit as long as the import of that specific item is smooth.. presently Viking is exported to Pakistan without any hitch and the process is going quite smoothly so the prices are towards the lower side.. the moment the import slows down and this item becomes short in the market, prices will definately rise..\n\nA similar example is that of Glock17 pistols, which we were buying for arround 400K some four years back.. now we are buying the same gun for 225K.. so what will we say that the quality of these newly imported Glock pistols has become substandard.. certainly not.. its just because the import of Glock pistols have increased so the prices have fallen down.\n\nIf one wants and wishes to buy a Baikal Viking handgun I think this is the right time to buy it before its price increases... :)', ''),

In the west, K2 is named the “savage mountain“. Only 299 climber ever assented  K2 as compared to Everest 2600 climbers have been successful. Last week, a sixteen years old reached mount Everest. If he would have tried K2 instead of Everest, I doubt if he would have been alive today.  Nobody ever reached K2 peak in the winter but Everest had been. \n	I was in Baltstan in 1966 to just see K2 but even the peak is not visible from the nearest village let alone any one dared to climb.

(159693, 'DSA Autoloader Shotgun Review; DSA Autoloader Shotgun Review; [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\n\nAt the risk of offending those who believe "desi" shotguns are nothing but absolute crap, shotguns manufactured by Daudsons Armoury Peshawar are famed for three things. Their quality, workmanship and totally missing an autoloader product line. Well...........That was yesterday. Let’s review their latest offering, a 12 gauge autoloader shotgun.\n\nIn typical Daudsons tradition, the shotgun is made by using the best of materials and technology available in Pakistan. The CNC machined receiver is made using imported bar stock aircraft grade aluminum alloy. The barrel is made out of imported 4140 Chrome-Moly Steel bar stock. The wooden furniture is carved out of hand picked/selected walnut after evaluating grain, quality and density of wood by master gunsmiths at DSA. Another thing worth mentioning here is that this time they have incorporated flush mounted screw-in chokes into the design to increase the versatility of the shotgun.\n\nMr. Nooruddin, the managing director of DSA called me up a few days back to give me the news of their new offering and to enlighten me on some of its salient features. Since most of you guys know me and my high-on-the-demand-side-personality when it comes to shotguns, I immediately requested some additions/customizations. To be honest, I basically asked too much from DSA. Being the kind gentleman that Mr. Nooruddin is, he immediately reworked the design and obliged me with a shotgun that is truly made as my specifications within days. Yesterday, I collected the "Pakguns Review Piece" from DSA Peshawar.\n\n[B]Specifications:[/B]\n\nGauge: 12 Gauge\nType: Gas Operated Auto-loading Repeater aka Autoloader (or Semi auto)\nBarrel Length: 26 Inches\nBarrel Material: 4140 Chrome-Moly Steel\nMagazine Capacity: 4+1\nChokes: 3 flush screw-in type chokes (IC, M, F)\nFurniture: Wood (select walnut with hand rubbed oil finish)\nSafety location: Behind the trigger guard\nFinish: Barrel = nice deep blue, Receiver = Powder coated\nSights: brass front bead, Receiver dovetailed for scope mount\nSlug firing Capability: Yes!\nPrice: PKR 27,000 with single barrel and wood furniture (without hard carry case).\n\n[B]Other Options available to customers:[/B]\n1. 28inch barrel length with screw-in chokes (PKR 5200)\n2. 21inch barrel length, cylinder bore and rifle sights for a dedicated smooth bore slug gun\n3. Complete plastic furniture. Buttstock and forend\n4. pistol grips, incase somebody wants to convert their shotgun into “I don’t know what purpose gun”\n5. Beautiful hard carry case with dual combination lock. Designed and manufactured at DSA. Accommodates, shotgun with all accessories and extra barrel. (PKR 3500)\n\n[B]Now the Eye Candy:[/B] [I]courtesy of Rotorcrafts[/I]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_4995.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_4997.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_4998.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_4999.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_5000.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_5008.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_5009.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_5013.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/KIF_5022.jpg[/IMG]\n[B]\nIMPRESSIONS[/B]\n\nThe moment I picked up the gun, the weight seemed on the higher side but  it is suitably balanced. I am guessing, the culprit is the weighty  furniture and a lot can be achieved by simply toning/slimming down the  wood a bit. The mount was as good as any Russian/Turkish shotgun. Wood  to metal fitting is first class. I can see meticulous attention to  detail given by the manufacturer in this regard. There is no rattling if  you tighten the forend screw all the way. It might require a tool to  open it back up afterwards though. The rubber butt pad is nice and  mushy. Just the way I like it. Not too soft and not too hard. The wood  has a pleasing grain and finish. Typical of a hand rubbed oil finish  that is instantly recognizable. Warm and smooth to touch, reminds me of  few things that I should refrain myself from mentioning here. The  checkering is deep and impressive. \n\n[B]The Barrel, Receiver and Internals:[/B]\n\nThe barrel is finished in a very nice deep blue (glossy). The bolt  handle, bolt, cartridge elevator and trigger are finished in bright  chrome. The aluminum receiver is powder coated with extremely uniform  finish with no flaws what so ever.\n\nThe bolt is impressively machined. No flaws whatsoever. The bolt slides  in the receiver pretty smoothly and the return speed is as good as it  gets with positive locking. I can see that the shotgun is provided with  massive extractors, another plus in my opinion. There is no rattling of  the forend when the bolt locks in place or when it slams back into the  chamber.\n\nThe receiver is well machined (CNC). Free of any flaws even though it is  provided with dovetails which complicates the design, hats off to DSA  for pulling this off and providing this wonderful feature. The barrel to  receiver lockup is superb. The rib is centered and runs straight to the  muzzle.\n\nThe action bars are also nicely machined. No tooling marks, burrs or  anything like that. Each and every part is firmly locked into place with  no rattling (an indication of loose tolerances) of any kind.\n\n[B]The Trigger:[/B]\n\nThe trigger is good enough. I did notice a little bit of creep (nothing  out of the ordinary) which I am expecting will improve with use. The  trigger breaks cleanly with no over travel. The trigger pull is heavy  but not by much. No need for a trigger job as it will eventually lighten  up with use. Plus the gun isn’t what you would call “thoroughly  cleaned” so it’s partially my fault. I should have cleaned all internals  before judging anything. Hey! I’m lazy alright! Besides, hard work is  great as long as somebody else is doing it. [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/images/smilies/smile.png[/IMG]\n\n[B]The Math Work:[/B]\n\n1.    Weight: 8.8lbs (told you it’s on a heavier side)\n2.    Rib Width: 8mm\n3.    Trigger Pull: 8.8lbs (do not compare with handgun trigger pulls)\n4.    Trigger Post-Travel: 0mm (Perfecto!)\n5.    Trigger Pre-Travel: 3mm\n6.    Balance Point: right under the bolt handle\n7.    Cylinder Bore Dia: 18mm or 0.709inch\n8.    Choke Dia: IC=17.75mm, M=17.5, F=17.25mm\n9.    Choke Length: 1.75inches\n\n[B]If I could, I would: (At the moment)[/B]\n\n1. lighten the gun up by probably shaving some of the excess wood, also  bring the balance point a little towards the muzzle. preferably at  barrel/receiver joint.\n\n2. work a little on the trigger if i cannot wait otherwise it will get better on its own with use \neventually.\n\n3. smoothen out the forend screw cause its a pain to take off once fully tighten.\n\n4. work a little on the safety cause its pretty hard to engage and  disengage. after playing with it a couple of times, I am expecting that  will eventually become soft as per my liking.\n\n5. clean the heck out of the gun. its basically my fault I should  removed all the preservative treatment before show casing the gun.\n\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\n\nAll in all a good shotgun that without a shadow of a doubt deserves  praise. From purely manufacturing standpoint, I can see that the  manufacturer has left no stone unturned (while keeping the cost factor  in check) in ensuring the quality that has always been the hallmark of  Daudsons Armoury Peshawar.\n\n[B]A little "Gun Porn" is in order I believe:[/B] [I]Kindly excuse my bad photography[/I]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00261.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00265.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00266.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00272.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00285.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]This picture illustrates the wood to metal fit:[/B]\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/Image3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]The bolt:[/B]\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00277.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Now something special:[/B]\nBottom of the forend\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/IMG_0383.jpg[/IMG]\n\nRight side of the forend\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/IMG_0385.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLeft side of the forend\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/IMG_0386.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B][B]************************* INTERNALS*************************[/B]\n\n[B]AoA Everybody[/B]\n\nI can talk for hours on the machining/finishing quality of the internals  but as the saying goes "a picture is worth a thousand words", its only  appropriate that I post some pictures instead.\n\nHere goes nothing cause pictures taken by me, are at best total crap.

DSA Autoloader shotgun is equal to 91.29% of a Baikal MP153 shotgun whereas it is at 54% with respect to price.\n\n2. Moving up from DSA Autoloader shotgun to Baikal MP153 would cause an  enhancement in performance of only 9.54% whereas would require a  additional funding of 85%.\n\n3. Moving down from Baikal MP153 Shotgun to DSA Autoloader would  generating savings of 46% but would cause the performance to fall only  by 8.71%\n[B]\nRegards.[/B]\n\np.s. I would like to thank Apolo for driving all the way to WAH from  Jehlum for this test and going through all the trouble in the process  and AK47 bhai for his generous hospitality and wonderful Tea.

This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.\n\nAkdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. Top of the upper receiver is shaped to provide integral Picatinny rail, which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight."', ''),

So disassembled the gun and saw the ugly butt of the damn russian wolf bullet just an inch away from the chamber :o immidiately phoned Sir Skeeter got the whole tutorial on removing it, went back home & removed the bullet from the barrel just as he told us.\nWe didnot have time for skeet at range as we reached there very late in the evening,  so AK bro missed the fun with Browning O/U but didnot forget to have a photo with it :) below are some pictures we took while cleaning the toys (and cherries :lol: ) showing blinking russian round, two MISTRY''S & the hardware used to get it out and more over NEW PAKGUN TARGET :)\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsGOU9J][img]http://s2.postimage.org/GOU9J.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsGOWES][img]http://s2.postimage.org/GOWES.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsGP0E9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/GP0E9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsGP5Dr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/GP5Dr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsGPfC0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/GPfC0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsGPn5r][img]http://s2.postimage.org/GPn5r.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

Specifically the mention of ''do not shoot when intruder escaping''. Most HD defensive attempts seem to happen ''after'' the incident, ie the BG is making a get away. This may or may not result in a shoot out, but the main rationale for HD firing taking place near the completion of the incident seems to be the fact that its when the BG is most vulnerable and has lost the element of surprise, that was with him/them at time of entrance.\n\nBased on what goes on, it does not seem as shooting the BG in the back is a bad thing at all. It seems to have become common knowledge (with the courts/police) that even shooting in the back of BG is a good thing since it will avoid a possible death or pain of another innocent civilian in the long run. Of course, if we could get stats on such cases, it will help significantly.', ''),

(116609, ' I respect everyone''s views and everyone has the right to have his/her own views.\n\nMy take on this is that:\n\nIf given the chance to take out an armed BG who has entered your premises and is still in your premises, take him out, whether by shooting him in the back or the front or the head, without waiting for him to raise his gun and point it at you or any of your family members. Don''t allow him any time by picking up the phone and calling police first. If you can, shoot him first and then call police. If he''s been shot at the back, also shoot a couple rounds in the front before the police arrive. Take his gun and fire a couple of shots on your walls to show self defence and make it easy for the Investigation team to close the case. Make sure the empties are there in the right places for the Investigation team to find and collect as evidence.\n\nOfcourse, (in the words of 12gauge) first shout the warning loudly, next, follow with a warning shot and then it''s boom shakalaka mothe######er time. I will simply not allow those MFs to savor anything by escaping alive once they''ve entered my premises and endangering me and my loved ones.

(116640, ' [quote=SA]I respect everyone''s views and everyone has the right to have his/her own views.\n\nMy take on this is that:\n\nIf given the chance to take out an armed BG who has entered your premises and is still in your premises, take him out, whether by shooting him in the back or the front or the head, without waiting for him to raise his gun and point it at you or any of your family members. Don''t allow him any time by picking up the phone and calling police first. If you can, shoot him first and then call police. If he''s been shot at the back, also shoot a couple rounds in the front before the police arrive. Take his gun and fire a couple of shots on your walls to show self defence and make it easy for the Investigation team to close the case. Make sure the empties are there in the right places for the Investigation team to find and collect as evidence.\n\nOfcourse, (in the words of 12gauge) first shout the warning loudly, next, follow with a warning shot and then it''s boom shakalaka mothe######er time. I will simply not allow those MFs to savor anything by escaping alive once they''ve entered my premises and endangering me and my loved ones. Set one example and this''ll serve as a deterrence for a long time to come.\n\nAgain, these are my views and anyone is free to differ.[/quote]\n\n\nBro\nI agree 100% with your first para.

The "camera" indeed went to hell bro, nowhere else! :mad:\n\nI''m really sadly sorry that we forgot the camera along with us  at the range and moreover, Den, I''m heck amazed to see that even the few pics we [b]DID[/b] take at your place, showing the dirt of Armscor ammo in the barrel of PT 145, as well as those taken of the stuck round in your Glock 17, all have "disappeared", like gone with the wind! :mad: \n\nAnyhow, to sum it all up bros, let me briefly tell you about the highlights of my recent Lahore and Sialkot visit.\n\nMy first stop for two/three days was in Lahore, basically a family trip of fun, food and some shopping.\n\nI had the pleasure here to be hosted by Naveed, our outstanding PG all-rounder "Jewel of the Crown" in Lahore, and it was indeed a great experience to be hosted by him for a long and late night dinner back at his place. Naveed, once again, it was one of the most delicious selection of dishes bro, the "after-taste" still somehow hangs on here and we really enjoyed being there with you, once again my profound thanks to your outstanding family and also to Amjad bro for "joining- in" during the late hours of gup-shup! :) \n\nThe tour continued on to Sialkot, where Denovo bro had made ground for a well-organized "lunch-cum- range- cum-dinner" event and we spent some lovely 10 hours together before I left from Sialkot at around 12 midnight, though Den really wasn''t happy about my late night leave, yet some pending matter back home compelled me to take the long drive back at night. \n\nDen, it was indeed one of the most memorable events of my life, bro, to see you along with our families at your venue in Sialkot, nicely arranged lunch and tasty "kiraarapan" of barbeque dinner was the best way indeed to end a Punjab "food" visit. :P\n\nMy profound thanks, Den, to your entire family for hosting us so hospitably bro, you really have a well organized "team-work" back home with that squad of young, handsome and cooperative lads at your service. My regards to all back home, and also to "Junior Denovo sb" for "accommodating" my "Junior" with lots of fun together! :)\n\nAnyhow, to come to some of the main points bro''s, the PT 145 performed absolutely flawlessly with some 30 shots, no FTE''s, no FTF''s or any hiccups of any sorts. \n\nNot being a "range shooter" myself, heck my main concern was to "somehow" get the shots ON paper from some 50 ft, and thanks God, apart from first few "low" shots, and Den''s intervention to keep the front sight slightly raised, my remaining shots landed fairly enough, though I need quite some practice before landing all of them towards the center black. We used Den''s new PG targets.\n\nOur only concern with the PT 145 firing however was the Armscor ammo! Heck, it was one "[b]DIRTY[/b]" affair! Unfortunately the pictures somehow "disappeared" from my camera, but heck you should all have had a chance to see the black "filth" on my barrel and feeding ramp, not to mention the outer area of muzzle end also! \n\nWe were both shocked to see the dirt from some 30 shots only, and though Den cleaned the gun "[b]INTENSIVELY[/b]" after our range visit, I just completed the cleaning [b]once again[/b] back home,[b] having to run some 15 CLOTHS through the barrel[/b] before I could get a clean sheet of cloth out of it! :o :mad:\n\n I''ve used Armscor ammo before, so has Den, but this was really quite a disappointing affair this time around, yet unfortunately in .45 cal, there''s no other option presently. :(\n\nAs far as the Glock is concerned, well firing it yesterday with Den was quite an amusing affair indeed and revoke to a great extent my "lost" 9mm love, until, however, shot No.8 got discharged [b]with smoke only[/b], leaving the projectile stuck in the barre! A Russian Wolf round! :mad:\n\nI must say here, though I personally wasn''t really hopeful without a "gunsmith intervention", Den indeed has some strong nerves when having to deal with his weapons and back home he quite brilliantly managed to "tapper" it out of the barrel without causing a single scratch on anything! :o :)\n\nAs for the queries about the round used, let me frankly say, either it wasn''t a genuine Wolf round, or it was genuine but  with a primer badly affected by "humidity" and climatic wear and tear. \n\nFinally, we unfortunately left the .357 rounds at home, so Den''s .357 "canon" of a revolver will be tried some other time, yet it was my genuine impression of this "monster" of a gun, that it''s a "section 302 invite" [b]with or without bullets[/b]! Hold it by the barrel and it''s an excellent "knock out" item by itself, even with an empty drum! :lol:\n\nDen''s "Jewel of the Crown" course was the outstanding and unique Browning O/U, and I must say, for 9mm lovers, Den''s OSS is one worthy item for consideration. Very slim profile, very "tactical", very concealable even, yes I said CONSEALABLE with a 5.25" barrel! :P \n\nOnce again Den, thanks for everything, wish and pray for some more quality time with you  in the nearest future. :) Regards. :)', ''),

For example 10 balls of 10 gauge diameter are required to make one pound of lead ball, or 20 balls of 20 gauge diameter are required to make one pound of lead ball, and so forth. This is the traditional, and very old, system. The actual (nominal) bore diameters of the various gauges are generally:-\na. 10 gauge = .775 inch\nb. 12 gauge = .729 inch sometimes mentioned as .73 inch also\nc. 16 gauge = .662 inch\nd. 20 gauge = .615 inch\ne. 28 gauge = .550 inch\nAnd finally I would like to mention that .410 is named for its nominal bore size, and is not a gauge at all.

These things require a split second decission.......trust me you cant plan anything before or after it ![/quote]\n\nI think that differs from person to person. For some, the above might be valid. While some might be capable of thinking logically and taking calculated risks even in split second decision-making scenarios. There are several factors which make one capable of the later. Their genes (nature), upbringing, sports during childhood (squash, swimming, etc), past experiences, practice and training for such scenarios, involving your family members in such practice and training, etc.\n\nI agree to the extent that one can''t plan to the finest and most minute detail, but one can plan and practice of all possible / probable scenarios and run the drill regularly to minimize the ''mind blacking out'' scenario as much as possible.\n\nTake yourself for example. You did manage to take out the third BG in your first such encounter.

(116877, ' ISLAMABAD, June 2: The Ministry of Interior has started tracking thousands of illegal arms licences of both prohibited and non-prohibited bore issued over the past three years.\n\nInterior Secretary Chaudhry Qamar-uz-Zaman informed the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the National Assembly on Wednesday that over 130,000 arms licences of prohibited and non-prohibited bore had been issued by the federal government over the past three years.\n\nMr Zaman gave these details at a PAC meeting held at the Parliament House here. The meeting was presided over by Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan. The committee scrutinised the Ministry of Interior’s accounts for year 2007-08 and highlighted audit paras for 2008-2009.\n\nThe secretary cited the figures when an audit para about non-reconciliation of Rs222.980 million deposited in the treasury for issuance of new arms licences came up for discussion. The audit said that as per the ministry’s records, Rs222.980 million had been deposited against the issuance of licences, but the ministry was yet to reconcile the amount.\n\nThe secretary, conceding that the ministry had a major scandal on its hands, said that of the 130,000 licences, some 90,000 were of non-prohibited bore and 40,000 of prohibited bore.\n\n“The ministry has already constituted a special committee to go through sacks full of manual records to determine how many fake licenses have been issued during this time,” the secretary said.\n\nSo far the ministry had scrutinised around 37,000 applications. Of these, eight to 10 per cent had turned out to be fake, Mr Zaman said, adding that the ministry had already issued show-cause notices for cancellation of the licences issued against dubious applications. A majority of applications did not carry bank receipts.\n\n“Since January this year, a complete ban is in place and no new licences are being issued,” the secretary said.\n\nHowever, Hamid Yar Hiraj of PML-Q said that according to his information, Interior Minister Rehman Malik was continuously recommending applications for new licences. The secretary clarified these applications had been processed before the imposition of the ban.\n\nIn reply to a question, the secretary said that the ministry had suggested to the prime minister to issue new arms licences through National Database Registration Authority (NADRA), which would be verifiable across the country.\n\nIn the past, it was a complete manual procedure and officials involved could have easily manipulated the process.\n\nThe secretary said that every lawmaker had a quota of 20 non-prohibited bore per month and 25 prohibited bore arms licences per year. However, all PAC members said they didn’t know about this quota.\n\nMr Riaz Pirzada of the PML-Q suggested that considering the level of violence in society, there should be a complete ban on issuance of arms licences.\n\n“I am unable to understand to whose hands these arms are going,” the lawmaker said.\n\nMr Hiraj, the PML-Q lawmaker, said a racket stretching from the ministry to the National Bank, arms dealers to arms buyers, would test the interior ministry’s efficiency.', ''),

However doing heavy loads such as slugs on a light setting. U will tear the weapon apart.

To my very humble observation and knowledge(Though I''m convinced for their accuracy and intend to buy PT/99) most part of the barrels of these handguns appears open, uncovered and enclosed / packed only near the rear sight and the muzzle, which makes me a little suspicious that these guns would start rattling(become loose and sound chhan, chhan) and lose accuracy with the passage of time.', ''),

(117331, ' Faisji sahib and KageFox have comprehensively described the use and makeup of tracers. Practically speaking, they have more utility in the fire of belt fed machine guns where a number of bullets are fired with the same aim and one can have a tracer round after every few regular rounds to see the direction of the burst at night. In semi auto weapons, they have limited practical utility because the firer has to re-aim every time (slow rate of fire).

(117341, ' Faisji has given a very comprehensive insight into the composition and uses. I will just add the normal mix in the medium machine gun or MG as we call it is 4 ball one tracer. The tracer burns long enough to show the firer if his bursts are going in the right direction and on target.\nThe Tracers actually ignite after traveling about 150 to 180 yds   so that the gun cannot be located when viewed  from a flank or obliquely. Also the trajectory of the tracer rounds  rapidly yaws away from the ball rds after traveling about 600 - 700 yards as the tracer loses weight due to combustion of the compound, and the  hollow of the bullet presents different ballistics.\nTracers are used to indicate objectives of attack and sometimes limits of the Fire base.\nIn defensive positions when the MGs are laid on Fixed Lines the tracers are removed and only ball rds are fired so that attacking soldiers can not anticipate the fire. ( I think it is more of  infantry jargon and battle craft) \nFor the purpose of information of the forum Faisji has done a great job', ''),

(117463, ' Gilani Sahib,   (Please keep the CF 98 Manual with you sir, and then read)\n\n      Please note that CF 98 can conduct both (single action) and (double action / joint action) firing. Note further that the (firing position) of a pistol is, when the hammer is (forwards) and when the hammer is forwards, this position is called as(double action stop position) or ( joint action stop position). The other one is the (cocked position) and it is when the hammer is (backwards) and when the hammer is backwards, this position is called as ( single action stop position). \n\n     1. In the light of the above, open page 8 of the manual where a Caution is written and it says, (To set bolt onto the firing mechanism, the hammer shall be at (joint action stop position), which means when the hammer is (forwards). \n\n      2. Now come to page 22 where right above the operation instruction it is written, ( To fix the bolt, move the hammer to turn (backward) to joint action stop position and fix the bolt. see fig.11). Now sir when the hammer is (backwards), it is not joint action stop position, it is rather (single action stop position), one thing. Secondly, it contradicts the things instructed by the manual earlier on page 8, discussed in point no 1 above, which for setting the bolt wanted the users to keep the hammer (forwards) and hence misleads. The fig on the adjacent page i.e. page no 23 also vindicates that here the hammer is said to be kept backwards and on page no 8 it was said to be kept at ( joint action stop position) or (forwards). \n\n     Sorry brother Cooldragon to have made it a bit complex and made some nitty-gritty details, but I have noted these. Respected Gilani Sahib, to me the things on page no 8 regarding bolt fixing seem correct.', ''),

Star never made a .30 Cal Handgun in this shape (they built 9mm or .45). So for one, its just local Ingenuity!\n\nSecondly, this is a very poorly maintained gun, I literally had to wrestle with it for field stripping. \n\nHowever, I must say that it is a very well built local handgun, better than the Darra TTs that I''ve seen. So in my opinion, it is not made in Darra atleast. Its feel is great, balance, slide fitting, trigger etc feels good . The person it belongs to says it was made ''in'' or ''by someone in'' POF! :o (I am quite doubtful on that statement)\n\nI''ve also been told that fixing its rear sights is a job for an expert gunsmith, and zeroing by an expert marksman! and that I''ll spend much more than anticipated on just ammo for zeroing!\n\nOn the other hand I''ve been told that it can be restored to almost new state, even upgraded to some extent! \n\nI must say that I really am confused, but all that will be clear after I try it out at the range! :D\n\nRegards.', ''),

(117518, ' [quote=Syed Adeel]Gilani Sahib,   (Please keep the CF 98 Manual with you sir, and then read)\n\n      Please note that CF 98 can conduct both (single action) and (double action / joint action) firing. Note further that the (firing position) of a pistol is, when the hammer is (forwards) and when the hammer is forwards, this position is called as(double action stop position) or ( joint action stop position). The other one is the (cocked position) and it is when the hammer is (backwards) and when the hammer is backwards, this position is called as ( single action stop position). \n\n     1. In the light of the above, open page 8 of the manual where a Caution is written and it says, (To set bolt onto the firing mechanism, the hammer shall be at ([b]joint action stop position[/b]), which means when the hammer is (forwards). \n\n      2. Now come to page 22 where right above the operation instruction it is written, ( To fix the bolt, move the hammer to turn (backward) to [b]joint action stop position[/b] and fix the bolt. see fig.11). Now sir when the hammer is (backwards), it is not joint action stop position, it is rather (single action stop position), one thing. Secondly, it contradicts the things instructed by the manual earlier on page 8, discussed in point no 1 above, which for setting the bolt wanted the users to keep the hammer (forwards) and hence misleads. The fig on the adjacent page i.e. page no 23 also vindicates that here the hammer is said to be kept backwards and on page no 8 it was said to be kept at ( joint action stop position) or (forwards). \n\n     Sorry brother Cooldragon to have made it a bit complex and made some nitty-gritty details, but I have noted these. Respected Gilani Sahib, to me the things on page no 8 regarding bolt fixing seem correct.[/quote]\n\nAdeel Brother, please see the bold text in the quote above. Both of them say it has to be done in Joint Action Stop position. The mere addition of the word backward is creating confusion. For that please refer to post #579 by cooldragon, which says the Manual is in Chinglish, i.e. English is word to word translated from Chinese (maybe using a software, which rarely keeps track of the grammar)\n\n\nOn the other hand, the sentence on page 22 does come under "complete disassembly" heading. Although I''ve never tried it but maybe the hammer is re-assemled in a cocked position, and before putting back the slide you have to put it "[b]Back[/b]" into Joint Action Stop position!\n\nWell thats what I think, maybe some seniors can shed more light on it! :)\n\nRegards', ''),

So no need to worry before that! ;)\n\nOn the other hand, if you have reached that mark, do consult a gunsmith.

[b]No wonder, Spetsnaz swore by a Makarov and trusted their lives with it.[/b] \n\n\n[b]I had always wondered that why did Makarov not get the fame that it rightly deserved.[/b] I am now quite convinced that had Makarov been manufactured in the West, it would have been far more famous and highly rated. It has mostly been portrayed sort of an impotent sidearm of Russian Army which lacked power and class. That is not entirely true. 9x18 Makarov is not as powerful as 9x19 parabellum but certainly more powerful than .32 ACP and .380 ACP (calibers that West has been using for their fixed barrel pistols like Walther PPK, Bersa Thunder, Sig P232 etc). In fact, 9x18 Makarov is perhaps the hottest ammo that one could safely use with a fixed barrel pistol and Russians just did that. \n\n[b]My humble advice; get hold of a Mak before it gets extinct.[/b] It''s a wonderful gun to have; well concealable, very rugged (all steel frame and slide) and extremely accurate for its size. But please note that beauty and practical utility of a Makarov lies in original single stack magazine models. Double stack models, IMHO, are deshaped (thick grips) and do not have the balance of original single stack magazine Makarov. :)\n\nOverall rating [b]VERY ACCURATE[/b]', ''),

(117744, ' [quote=Skeeter60]Faisji has given a very comprehensive insight into the composition and uses. I will just add the normal mix in the medium machine gun or MG as we call it is 4 ball one tracer. The tracer burns long enough to show the firer if his bursts are going in the right direction and on target.\nThe Tracers actually ignite after traveling about 150 to 180 yds   so that the gun cannot be located when viewed  from a flank or obliquely. Also the trajectory of the tracer rounds  rapidly yaws away from the ball rds after traveling about 600 - 700 yards as the tracer loses weight due to combustion of the compound, and the  hollow of the bullet presents different ballistics.\nTracers are used to indicate objectives of attack and sometimes limits of the Fire base.\nIn defensive positions when the MGs are laid on Fixed Lines the tracers are removed and only ball rds are fired so that attacking soldiers can not anticipate the fire. ( I think it is more of  infantry jargon and battle craft) \nFor the purpose of information of the forum Faisji has done a great job[/quote]\nand it feels like wpns faculty from inf school just moved in to clear the point!\n\n[b]139[/b]', ''),

(117761, ' Azam Agha Sir, \nIMHO, pluses and minuses of CF98 and NP22 are as following; (I don''t think that NP42 is available and even if it is avaialable, it is absolutely the same thing as CF98. The barrel life story, IMHO, is due to error in printing or something like that otherwise both pistols are exactly same, manufactured by Cheng Feng). :)\n\n-  NP22 is a Sig P226 clone. CF98 is an original Chinese design.  \n\n-  [b]CF98 is comparatively more accurate[/b] out of the two. That is primarily because of a rotating barrel mechanism that CF 98 has. \n\n-  [b]NP22 is more reliable.[/b] I have never experienced even a single stoppage in well over 500 rounds that I fired with 3 different NP22. Conversely, I have experienced around 25 stoppages in more than 2500 rounds that I fired with six different CF98. The reason, in my view, is again the rotating barrel mechanism in which feed ramp is partially located on the barrel / breach and partially on the connector. Any mis-alignment of feed ramp on connector with the portion of feed ramp on the breach causes FTF. This is not very frequent but keeps happening after every 100-200 rounds at an average. Chances are more when the gun is not clean or with non-standard ammo such as JHPs with wider nose. \n\n-  [b]NP22 is more robust.[/b] It has a steel slide with alloy frame. CF98 has a polymer frame. Most parts of NP22 are ruggedly constructed with lots of metal in it whereas CF98 is comparatively delicate. \n\n-  [b]CF98 is lighter in weight[/b]. NP22 is a little heavy. Both weapons are not suitable for conceal carry. \n\n-  [b]Price wise[/b], both are more or less the [b]same[/b] nowadays, ie, around 32-33K. \n\n-  [b]Both have a very average trigger.[/b] CF98 trigger is on the lighter side but is inconsistent. NP22 trigger is slightly on the heavier side and is again inconsistent. So in trigger quality, both are quite mediocre. \n\n-  [b]Both pistols are not at all ammo sensitive[/b] and fire all types of ammo without a problem (incl POF, Chinese, Russian etc). NP22 is comparatively more reliable. \n\n-  Both pistols have a [b]manageable recoil.[/b] \n\n-  [b]NP22 has wider sights[/b] which are good for combat shooting. CF98 sights are a little narrower which are not really great for combat shooting / rapid fire. \n\n-  [b]NP22 magazine is far better[/b] than CF98. \n\n-  Both have reasonably good grip. [b]In NP22, lot of customization options are available.[/b] CF98, being a polymer frame, has limited options (only hogue grip etc). \n\n-  [b]Overall, I would rate NP22 a shade better than CF98[/b] in my personal assessment, but the difference is not much. However, it would differ from person to person, depending upon an indls preferences. \n\nHappy buying :)', ''),

(117830, ' [quote=SA] Hence, one has to re-zero his air rifle if he switches from Match to Pro Magnum and vice versa.[/quote]\n\nVery true. Pellets whose weights differ to a certain extent exhibit this. At shorter ranges (10-15m) you can often get the shot on target by holding the sights/cross-hair a little high or low. Things get a little problematic at longer ranges as the windage is also affected, often due to pellet shape. If one has a Mil-Dot scope, theoretically it should be easy to adjust, as a specific Mil-Dot can be used to target the a different pellet.... Or if one has the expensive Burris Quad scope, which has settings for 4 calibers...\n\nInshallah, if all goes well, I''ll run an experiment with these two pellets with my new scope within the next two weeks, now that I''m free from exams Hopefully, I''ll be able to figure out how many clicks of adjustment are required to be made on the scope (up/down, left/right) while switching between these two.', ''),

However, it is the type of mechanism (blow back / fixed barrel, rotating barrel etc), quality of barrel, slide to frame fitting (whose effect is greatly minimised in a blow back operated handgun),  quality of trigger, quality of sights, grip and overall quality of construction of other pistol parts which collectively result in an overall accurate and reliable gun. \n\nYou must have seen in this thread that few pistols with 127 mm or 114 mm barrels have performed far poorer as compared to a Makarov which has 93.5 mm barrel or CZ999 which has 108 mm barrel. \n\n[b]One more thing; reliability and accuracy does not always enhance with the price of a handgun.[/b] In my personal opinion, Taurus PT99 is more accurate and reliable than many +200K handguns that are available in Pakistan nowadays.

(117936, ' The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has found a nexus between Islamabad’s civil administration and three influential personalities of the city in a Rs160 million corporate housing societies scam, compelling the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to order immediate action against one of the main accused.\n\nThe scam involved funds intended for the National Assembly and Senate Secretariats Employees Cooperative Housing Societies.  It was unearthed when the FIA additional director-general disclosed that Islamabad’s deputy commissioner (DC) Amir Ali, in collaboration with National Assembly Deputy Secretary Tariq Khakwani, gave Rs90 million to three parties, supposedly to purchase land for the housing society, but without buying even an inch of land.\n\nThe PAC had directed the FIA  in February 2010 to conduct an inquiry.\n\n“Out of Rs160 million, as much as Rs90 million was given to Usman Nawaz Khokar, son of Haji Nawaz Khokar [former deputy speaker of the National Assembly], Haji Naeem and Malik Tabaruk Hussain,” said the FIA Additional Director-General.\n\nHe said that the Islamabad DC acted in his capacity as registrar of the housing society and Tariq Khakwani was the society’s administrator.\n\n“The committee unanimously directs that … disciplinary action must immediately be taken against the deputy secretary and in the next step an FIR be lodged against him,” said PAC Chairman Chaudhry Nisar.\n\nHe said that further action would be taken after constituting a joint committee of the National Assembly and the Senate. Chaudhry Nisar said if parliamentarians could not protect the rights of parliament’s employees they did not deserve to sit in parliament”.\n\nAccording to an FIA official, Khakwani confessed that Ali summoned him in his office and asked him to issue a cheque for Rs50 million in favour of Hajji Naeem.\n\n“I am not the only one involved in the scam. Islamabad’s deputy commissioner is also involved,” Khakwani is reported to have said. The FIA official said that Islamabad’s chief commissioner unfroze the accounts of the housing society and helped usurp the money.\n\nHowever, Ali strongly rebutted the FIA’s claims. “On February 25, I was removed from my position and the society purchased the land in March,” he said.\n\n[b]Moreover, the PAC directed the Ministry of Interior to submit a detailed report about the issuance of 133,219 arms licenses in the last three years. The office of the Auditor-General of Pakistan informed the committee that the ministry issued 44,558 new arms licenses in 2007-2008 but that there was no record of Rs223 million in license fees.[/b]\n\n[b]Interior Secretary Chaudhry Qamar Zaman said that the ministry issued 133,219 licenses in three years out of which 93,446 were of non-prohibited bore and 39,973 of prohibited bore.[/b]\n\n[b]Online added that the interior secretary told the committee that a ban had been imposed on the issuance of fresh arms licenses from January 1 due to these malpractices.[/b]\n\n[b]PAC member Hamid Yar Hiraj said that the PM Secretariat, the Interior Ministry and the National Bank of Pakistan were involved in the scandal.

Better would be to go to a proper gunsmith when you intend replacing the trigger spring , sear spring, etc. \n\nOrdinary users like us should only restrict ourselves to the field stripping of a handgun for cleaning purpose.

(118138, ' [b]@Airgunners of PakGuns[/b]\n\nOkay, so today I tried to zero the scope of my rifle. The procedure: I set up a target at 25-30 yards from the gun. Used a plastic stool as a rest, with a tightly rolled-up cloth underneath the forearm of the airgun to cushion the impact. Checked all the scope screws for tightness. Started shooting 5-shot strings at the target, until the shots were roughly spread 2-inches around the bullseye. After which the sun started to set; making me wrap up things... Can the esteemed experts point out the flaws (quite a number of them here) and suggest improvements to the zeroing procedure? I will be giving it another try tomorrow...\n\nNow, I will confess, I have little patience with paper targets. Often it takes me several sessions of shooting to get a scope to centre on the target. I usually have troubles with shooting good groups. Can someone suggest what is a good group with a high power rifle such as my Shadow 1000, at 10m, 20m, 30m (or yards)?\n\nWhen I shoot (and not just with scopes) I often have trouble maintaining groups on a paper bullseye. Give me a similarly sized object to shoot at the same range (something animate, like a plastic bottle cap) and I''ll keep on shooting it until I lose sight of it... often without any misses. If I miss, I am usually able to figure out where to hold off the sights for a hit. Worst part is, I fail to apply the same concept to the paper bullseye? Can someone decipher this? Is it me, or is my rifle incapable of shooting 1-inch groups at 15 yards? Or am I expecting too much of myself and/or my air rifle, and should stick to metal tins & stuff and leave the paper to the pros?\n\nYour input upon this matter will be greatly appreciated.

The other video seems to answer that but it will take a few more shots to get it just right.\n\nSighting in an Air Rifle Scope.mov \n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuon5sW0luE&feature=related[/url]\n\nThis worked for me. Now the only thing is that, later on, every time you do this you will find the scope creeping on a paper target. I''m no expert in any way, but my guess is that the setup for a paper target is much too precise. \n\nOn a paper target one aims for the exact bulls eye and expects a perfect result; scope creep (if nothing else) will prevent that. Then one tends to consciously / unconsciously ''adjust'' the aim and the result is all over the place (actually seems much worse on paper as you can see where the ''missed'' shots landed. On a non-paper object, such as a bottle cap, you will only see the shot that landed and the shooting will be more by feel than while being stressed out with precision lines on the target/scope. \n\nThat''s what I felt when self analyzing my own shooting. And, yes, I had the exact same experience once of a (casual) first shot ''bulls eye'' on a bottle cap from 15 yards. It felt great! I didn''t shoot any more that day to preserve the memory :P\n\nJust my two cents. The real experts can guide better.', ''),

(118234, ' MR brother, welcome to the shooters world. Now there will be no going back :lol: \n\nOK. I think detailed comments can only be given by an expert like Skeeter60 sahib, however, I will just mention few points. \n\n-  First and foremost, please do not be shy of posting the results. And please do not compare rifle fire with pistol fire. Regardless of the scores, the above rifle fire is quite an ordinary effort in my view. Conversely, pistol fire is a very difficult fire and requires more skill and concentration. You should have your complete focus on identifying your errors and than practicing to eradicate those. Don''t bother about the results. Focus on technique and results will follow. \n\n-  Personally speaking, I think you have shot pretty well and with practice, you will definitely further improve. You are not flinching, for sure. \n\n-  As for the groups forming upwards, most probably your gun shoots up so you may try aiming 6 o''clock or even sub 6 o''clock. Please do check your grip / hold also to make sure that there is no limp wrist involved. \n\n[b]-  Most importantly, your focus during next few days should be two things \n   1.  Focus on front sight tip and just let the target be a blur in the background. \n   2.  Trigger control. Just squeeze the trigger slowly but firmly and try to achieve a surprise break. \n[/b]\n-  Concentrate hard. After shooting 1 round, put your hand down, rest for a couple of seconds and again re-aim with concentration on front site tip. Breath out and try to shoot within 7 seconds. If it takes longer than 7 seconds, don''t fire and just put your hands down. Rest for few seconds and re-aim. \n\n-  Record your shooting result properly. Analyse it when you come back. Please do go through the shooting tips given by Skeeter60 sahib at the start of this thread. Be steadfast and determined, you will have to run a long course :)\n\nregards and happy shooting.', ''),

Same''ol s### in new packing.\n\nThis ''piece of art'' doesn''t realize that by doing this, he is actually doing a dis-service to M&S''s business. He had been on our radar since day ono, was just waiting for him to make the first move.\n\n[quote=psychiatrist-1]\nThere are split opinions about Mr. Farhan (Majeed & Sons). I think his mood is not stable and in my professional opinion, he may be suffering with "Bipolor disorder". So be kind to him, his mood swings is not under his control.[/quote]\n\n[quote=psychiatrist-1]\n........... well a Bipolor person can be very dangerous under stress and especialy with a gun. Rudeness and irrirtable mood is very common in BPD. These people are prohibted to posses fire arms in the USA, let alone they will be allowed to be arms dealers. This is the same as to give a fully loaded machine gun to a known robber. The best precaution is to stay away from them.\n[/quote]\n\nThanks for your professional analysis.\n\nGuys, a humble suggestion. Let''s leave this discussion on M&S and Mr. Farhan as, after all the above discussion, there is enough info for any member to make up his mind whether to go to him or not.\n\n[b]There always are some dealers / retailers, who like to deal only with BIG and ELITE clients and are generally not comfortable with everyday customers. Such dealers also sometimes have unique items in their inventory which they normally keep and offer to their selected clients/customers. It''s their business, their decision and as long as they''re happy with it, that''s fine. At the same time there are some customers who have lots of money to spend, want everything new/unique in their inventory as soon as it hits the market, like to be pampered and treated as royalty AND it is such customers to whom such dealers (like M&S) cater to. Neither do I blame the dealer nor the customer. If both dealer and customer are happy, why the heck should I have any issue. Right ?[/b]\n\nSo guys, let''s move on.\n\nWould just like to close this post by quoting HasanJamshed''s comments:\n\n[quote=HasanJamshad]Thank You Urika391 for your input. You said that Majied Sons is a kind of speciality Mall, as it has so many scarcely available weapons. And at the same time guy is some kind of union leader, have many vvip clients, is a collector himself. Strange thing for me is that does this all give someone liberty to behave like a sub human and overcharge the customers. I want to remain very impartial and objective as the guy cannot defend himself at this forum. \n\nAs far as the unavailability or uniqueness of some weapons is concerned, the actual situation is not that bad. As a gun enthusiast i have come to a conclusion that there is no weapon that can be kept by a civilian law fully that is not available in Pakistan. It is just the matter of information. [b]I think this forum is going to play a major role in breaking some dealers monopoly and disinformation circle.

Similarly, I am using the same spellings as have been used there at the museum. I have photographed the explanations as well, but including them in the post would have created lot of confusion.

That must''ve been some trip! Being a fan of historic weapons, I can honestly say that this has increased my knowledge a lot! \n\nBy the way, the pistol that I''ve quoted is called a "Derringer" now and is quite famous in the U.S and is being mass produced for customers world wide. It''s design actually started to take shape during the early 1800''s and since then its been heavily modified (To some degree). Just goes to show that this relic of a design is still somewhat practical in today''s modern age. :)\n\nQuick Trivia: A Philadelphia version of the derringer was used to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. \n\nThumbs up for the thread! :)\n\nP.S here''s the modern Derringer; \n[img]http://www.eaglegrips.com/guns/images/bond%20derringer%20logo.jpg[/img]', ''),

Do you really think Govt. of Pakistan charges 200% or in some cases 300% import duty? I just can''t understand this plea that the rate of dollar rising  so that''s why prices hike upwards. Man come on its all about intentness, if i am earning 200% more profit why should i compromise on lesser!\n\nI would also like to share that there is one officially proclaimed representative of Glock in Karachi who import directly from Austria running business in the name of MASS International in Uni Plaza I.I.

They can''t be manufacturing this ammo for firing from some Remington rifle only. The quality of cases (those that did not crack) was also quite ordinary. Seems to be some quality control issue.

(118475, ' Adeel sahib, \n\n-   Slide to frame fitting is the fitting of the slide (which contains barrel, recoil rod, spring, firing pin, ejector, extractor etc) with the frame (lower portion of the handgun which houses trigger, hammer assemblies, magazine etc). The open barrel design of Beretta 92 does not effect the slide to frame fitting as such, however, it does expose the barrel dust etc.   \n\n-   Regarding the shape of trigger guard, I think that PT99 guard is ok (in my personal preference). However, such things are really a matter of personal preference. They effect certain shooters but do not effect the others. Shooters who feel uncomfortable with a roundish trigger guard may not buy that gun. \n\n-   Taurus PT 92/99 is basically not a range gun or match pistol. It''s a combat pistol. Many of us use it on the range because it is quite accurate and does the job almost as well as many high end match pistols. However, the basic purpose of this handgun is combat, HD / SD and in my view, it is one of the best HD/SD pistols available in the market nowadays.\n\nregards', ''),

I managed 80%, while he scored around 90% :)  Most of the things learn''t today were applied at this particular shooting session. Results show a tighter group compared to earlier ones. Quite pleasing to look at.\n\nHere''s the result:\n\n[img]http://i887.photobucket.com/albums/ac78/ahsontariq/IMG00293.jpg[/img]\n\n\nOverall, it was a great day of learning for me. I came to know several basic mistakes I''d been making which were rectified. Alot more improvement needs to be done, which can only be achieved through regular practice under proper guidance. I feel, if I can get to this point in only my second visit to a range (ever), I can do alot more in a short time. But the point is, you only get to learn the basics and identify your mistakes by shooting at proper targets and under proper guidance.\n\nThankyou SkeeterSb and Gilani Sb for your priceless suggestions and look forward to your guidance in future as well.\n\nEnjoyed the company of GunFreak, GunPsycho and Immu10 and also got to meet Sultan, Salahuddin, Azeem and Captain Ayaz at the range.

I dont think so that its just better than Junk. Size of CF is very reasonable and grip is very comfirtable for all sizes of hands as far as accuracy is concerned you can check the 100% practical based accuracy results in handgun accuracy thread as well outer saftey of CF98 is also good.\n\nBrother in my opinion CF98 is one of te best available handgun in 30 to 34k price range.

It has happened to many people that when they needed their gun to fire, the safety was on. Racking the slide before use is the safest method to ensure that the gun would work and their is nothing wrong. (Here I am not talking of decocker, I am talking of manual safeties which would block a gun from firing). No wonder LEA people like Glock because it would fire when needed.

(118622, ' SA sahib, very good shooting. What you need is more practice and you will see a very quick improvement. When I say more practice, it does not mean a large number of bullets being fired. IMHO, a shooter should not fire more than 60 rounds in a day. Actually after that it starts becoming counter productive. So one may fire up to 60 rounds or even less, but with full concentration, analysing the fire after every string of 5 bullets and reflecting on the mistakes. Total time spent on the range may be more but one should not fire too much. I am sure we will see far better results because I don''t see any basic issues with your fire. With more practice groups will tighten up and scores will follow.\n\nPlease don''t forget to continue doing dry firing in between the two range sessions :) \nGood luck and regards. :)', ''),

Other things that you may like to focus upon are [b]focusing on front site[/b], [b]trigger control[/b] and [b]breathing control[/b]. \n\nPlease don''t worry about a group on paper target. It''s more difficult than hitting bottle caps because you have to be absolutely focused and consistent, every time and all the time. [b]That is why they say that bullseye shooting with iron sights is the mother of all shooting drills.[/b] If you master this basic and relatively more difficult skill, other shooting drills are easy to learn. Bullseye shooting is therefore like grammar. If one know grammar well, learning to write essays or columns or poetry or any such thing would not take long provided one has the talent. However, without knowing the grammar one wont be able to go far in the world of language. Same is the place of bullseye shooting in this sport  :)\n\n[b]Perseverance is the another attribute that a shooter always needs to have.[/b] Many a times results don''t come as per expectations though one seems to be doing everything right. This happens even with the best of shooters. [b]Stay the course and go back to basic drills.[/b] Rest. Give a gap between the shooting sessions. With a fresh mind and body, you will feel the change. \n\nI would also advise you to go through the tips given in the Competition Shooting and Marksmanship thread.

(118655, ' From my last 5 or so visits to the range and discussion with the management, I have come to a conclusion regarding the different categories of memberships.\n\nThe club management is following a wait and see policy as far as the rules for different categories are concerned. Currently they are allowing all the benifits of Category A and B to Cat C members. I am sure that most of the benefits will be taken away in the future.\n\nOne person says that C members cannot bring guests and the other says the opposite. \n\nThe charges sheet says that all category member’s wife and children may apply for there individual cards whereas the management says that C members don’t enjoy that liberty.\n\nI was told that they will not allow the same guest for more than 4 visits and will offer membership to that guest.\n\nMy understanding says that they will first get you hooked to the club through C category membership and after 2 years or so they will either double its fee or remove this category hence giving the C members the option to go for category A or B.\n\nI have taken A category because of the following reasons:\n\n1) If I go to the club twice a month, then I end up paying Rs 14,400 (600 per visit) a year under Cat . C and after my 7th yearly renewal I will have paid 100k, hence coming at par with the 100k paid for Cat. A. ( In my calculations I am not considering inflation, rupee depreciation and ease of installments, as that would make it complicated). \n\n2) In Cat. C, I don’t get the option where my family get their own card.\n\n3) If too many people start visiting the range then most probably the management will put a ban on Cat. C members to bring their guests.\n\n4) The rates will definitely be increased again after 5 years or so and the most effected Cat. will be C.  I have personally experienced that as before this revision of rates I had Cat. C membership and now I regret why I didn’t get Cat. A or B before.\n\nThis is a life time hobby and paying 100k extra now for Cat. A is in my opinion not a bad deal.', ''),

SA and i went to the range today and boy did we do some shooting.  I have to tell you guys he is pretty good.  He shot with his pt92 and pt145 both beauties.  I tried my new virgin G26.  There were atleast 15 members there.  We saw in action berette combact combo, king cobra, viking 446, cz999,G17and others.  One of SA''s friends brought some semi NPB machine gun type beretta 9mm (old).  I could''nt get a chance to ask him what it was but it was surely a beauty. And i was particular impressed with the viking446''s trigger.  Very nice weapon indeed.  SA please post your thoughts.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\n@ Gunfreak,\n\nSirjee, you say I was good with my PT145. What about your G26 which you were shooting for the first time and repeating bulls one after the other at 10 meters.\n\nBro, check this link. Already posted my experience of yesterday here. Couldn''t have gone to sleep without it ;) \n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=134424#p134424[/url]\n\nI think you''ve missed this thread as well as the Handgun Accuracy thread [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4252[/url] . Spend sometime going through different threads in each section and you''ll see what a WEALTH of knowledge and information is lying everywhere for us to absorb. \n\n@ Everyone,\n\nGuys, we have a very nice addition in our community by the name of GunFreak. Though I''ve known and met him since 2004 through work, but never new that he too was a Gun Enthusiast. And when last week I received his email through pakguns with his full name did I realize who he was. Called him up immediately and met with him at my office the other day, though this time the meeting had totally different agenda items (both PB and NPB) :)  He''s a good shot and a very pleasing person to enjoy quality time with. Even without meeting you all, he''s already a fan of AK, Denovo, Gilani, Skeeter and Naveed. Wait till he meets you all. :)\n\nAnd btw, that "semi NPB machine gun type beretta 9mm (old)" was GunPsycho''s piece of art. A blowback Beretta 9mm PB item from WW2 era, which for obvious reasons, cannot be discussed here. Was fired in single fire mode at the range after due permission from Range Master. It was a TREAT to fire. No recoil whatsoever and deadly accurate at 15 meters. Something about GunPsycho here: He ''truly'' is a GunPsycho and though one does not get to know this initially, mainly due to his humble and down to earth personality, once one gets to know him and see his ''hidden'' inventory, he''s truly amazed. For instance, while most of us are coming to know recently of what a fine weapon this MP446 is, this chap has been enjoying it since 2006. Likewise in case of CZ999. :)\n\n\n\n\nBack to AK''s ''rejuvenated bride''. ;)', ''),

Actually after that it starts becoming counter productive. [b]So one may fire up to 60 rounds or even less, but with full concentration, analysing the fire after every string of 5 bullets and reflecting on the mistakes.[/b] Total time spent on the range may be more but one should not fire too much. I am sure we will see far better results because I don''t see any basic issues with your fire. With more practice groups will tighten up and scores will follow.\n\nPlease don''t forget to continue doing dry firing in between the two range sessions :) \nGood luck and regards. :)[/quote]\n\nThankyou for your valuable suggestions Sir.\n\nWas discussing this thing with GunPsycho and GunFreak yesterday as well. I shot 95 (9mm) + 10 (.45) rounds during this session. Now the plan is to shoot max 3 rounds of 15 each (with analysis after each 5 shots) in future.

(118792, ' [b]@Bro KageFox:[/b]    I really appreciate your efforts/Inputs for this particular discussion/topic which also encouraged me to share/write my experiences with my Shadow 1000 since I have bought it from Our Dear PG Bro Naveed from Lahore. We might me having same thing/problem with our Shadows so let me allow to share my experiences having with me air rifle then will continue and discuss more. \n\n[b] @Bro MIdrees Taj:[/b]  Brother thanks for your informative reply to KF which might be having some reality so I have a related question for you regarding this issue, Did you experienced this gone case(break down) with you shadow as well? and IF yes: then after using how many pellets ?   As you have said around 4k+ pellets used since you have bought your shadow. \n\n[b]@Sir Skeeter60 and Sir Gilani:[/b]     I am no where near your Knowledge, Experience and Expertise but what you have suggested to KF brother regarding this particular issue, you both are absolutely and 100% right that we youngster should use open iron sights more and more and try not to use these cheap chines scopes in our basic practicing.  \n\nHere is my experiences with my Shadow 1000 since I bought it.  I have got it along with the Tasco 4x32 Scope (Chinese) but was not mounted so I adjusted/align its iron sights, after few shots it was done and I started enjoying its accuracy on Tins, Lizards, Matchboxes, Glass Coke Bottles etc etc.  After couple of days I think of using its scope and mounted it but it gave my hard time while zeroing it, weeks/days gone it but this zeroing process never ends because every after 20-30 shots it looses zero so now I am really sick of doing this zeroing things so have unmounted this scope.  This weekend I managed some free time and did some target practicing with open iron sights. At first run aligned its iron sights (Crouching position and rested the gun on chair, distance was around 15m and used Gamo Match Pellets. Sorry didn''t manage any photo shoot but will try next time) In first run 4 shots fired having really tight ground  3 shots were linked with each other and 4th one was also almost there but all was hitting 3 inches low of the bull.  Actually i was trying to align both front and rear sights even elevation of the rear sight was max high even then i am hitting this low at 15m. So in my 2nd run I started focusing only the front sight and get surprised with my next 3 shots which was right at the one inch bull and was linked with each other but here''s the misery started when the 4th shot goes to the left followed by every next shot and more to the left up and down in the same session.  (every thing was same abut what went wrong ?)  Anyway i decided to give some rest to my eyes and started searching for any other smaller object can be use as a target finally got this idea of using dead batteries and found few small AA sized batteries and couple of Jumbo sized batteries. So placed them at same distance and back to my same position and started with the AA small once.  Fist 3 shots right on target all 3 smaller batteries flew but when it comes to the Big one i fired 3 shots but was unable to hit the Fatter one and i was like .... What the HELL is happening  :mad:      I have just knocked down 3 smaller with 3 shots but not be able to do with the bigger cell even in 3 shots  :/    So i end-up my day with this mystery  :rolleyes: \n\n\n[b]@KF:[/b]    This might be the same case like Bro MIdrees Taj is referring in his above post. I will give my shadow another try for this particular issue and then will share it,  but as for as my shadow usage is concern i don''t think so that my rifle is that much heavily used.  Let say i have used max around 300 pellets since i bought it and before with Naveed Bro may be 1k (so 1.5k at the max)  Here i would like to re-post that same video link which I had posted in my other thread  [b]"Spring Air Rifle Maintenance after 1000 shots"[/b]  but i am [b]concerning the availability/substitute of the different lubs/Oil used in this video ?[/b]   Like  [b] "Spring Oil" and "Cylinder Bore Oil"[/b]  So keeping in mind this necessary maintainance/cleaning issue I think/hope this problem can be solved without any major part''s replacement as a matter of fact we don''t have any such option available in our country.  :|   \n\n\nVideo Link:     [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MprXfZ4Kz2U&feature=related.[/url]\n\n[b]@Sir Skeeter60 and Sir Gilani or Anyone: [/b]     Any suggestion/idea about these different lubs/oil products ?

A dealer would be able to answer it better. \n\n-  About the difference in rotating barrel and other types of pistols, I am really not aware if it can make any difference in sound.

An observation I made today, the Pro Mags have a very snug fit in the breech compared to the Match pellets, which have considerable play.\n\nAs I may have stated earlier, my rifle has gone through 1.5K-2K shots. No maintenance, other than an oily cloth wipe. After seeing the video, posted by Lionheart... I am confused... the lubricants used in the video are most probably not available here. Are there any substitutes we could use to somewhat restore our Shadows?\n\nLater this week, I will try and get out Abba''s Hunter 440, whose power plant is similar to that of the Shadow''s. The rifle is relatively newer, possibly less than 200 or 300 shots through it. Lets see what kind of groups it turns out and then maybe we can work on a conclusion regarding the life of a Shadow...\n\nBtw, I visited Mustafa Enterprises today regarding the scope issue. No luck, the guy told me that the distance of a target varies with the possible zoom!!! Strange... but I have a feeling I have been duped... He didn''t have another model of the same item, and refused to change it. I let the matter drop...\n\nI asked him about Shadow''s replacement parts and stuff, and he nodded his head in the affirmative. Then, I showed him my 20-year old Daisy Powerline 880 pneumatic pump... upon seeing the gun... he shook his head... and said, [i]"Beta, iss mein fault hai, nahi ban sakti."[/i] He named a series of airgun manufacturers, all of which had "faults". Coincidence, all the guns he mentioned were pump pneumatics (Daisy, Benjamin, Crosman). Leads me to believe that people here have little to no expertise regarding the repair of pump guns... [b]If somebody knows a gunsmith who has the expertise required to repair pneumatic pump guns, please let me know.[/b] This gun is my pride and joy, and being my 13th birthday gift (after being used for several years by Abba) as well as my first airgun, it has quite some sentimental value.

(118915, ' Its not weapons alone which win a war. Its tactics.\n\nThe Germans tactics worked well while they were on the offensive, the prime example being the Blitzkrieg. The German tactics worked when an enemy was caught off-guard. \n\nUnfortunately, a different type of tactic is required while on the defense or holding ground. Bad attack planning and timing forced the Germans into a bad position in Soviet Russia, forcing them to abandon their Eastern front-line later on. It is said the a contingent of German troops had the roof of the Kremlin itself within eye-view, when Hitler ordered the assault to a halt. A similar case during D-Day; the German defenses failed to hold up against the Allied invasion of the Normandy beach. I feel that the Germans had planned out their attack well, but their policies and tactics during the war cost them victory.\n\nIn any case, weapon modifications and innovations usually came too late in the war to make any major difference. No doubt, the German scientists and engineers were imaginative and inventive. The application of the weapons created was where the Germans lacked, IMHO.\n\nThat''s my opinion.

Compare them to, say, the Garand and the SHerman, for both their simplicity/reliability and the sheer numbers in which these were built...[/quote]\n\n\nwell as far as the TIGER tank is concerned so it was the most deadliest tank of WW2, in a site i read that i takes 4 shermans to take out a single tiger tank and only one sherman returns back. and to counter garand the Germans had Gewehr 43 which was i think much more powerful than Garand. on the other hand the Germans had 88mm flak AA/AT guns which were also very much power ful and easy to use weapon of that time.\n\none of the guy said that the Germans were against Nazis so i think thats not true, the Germans were fully supporting thier ARMY but now a days Germans dont like NAZIS and HITLER but its just because of that they lost the war and its human nature that it dont like defeats. ( one common example of that is the camo pattern of Modern German is same as it was of NAZIS Army, if they hated Nazis so why didn''t they changed it?)\n\ni hope you guys will agree', ''),

(119194, ' khanjee brother, Zastava Arms is known for producing quality firearms since 150 years. Zastava barrels are very high quality and machining of various parts is very good. So if we purely talk of  the quality of manufacturing, M57 in my view is far ahead. Its very reliable due to a simple design / single stack magazine and because of its slim profile, M57 is more concealable than CF98. Both are quite accurate. CF98 has advantage in magazine capacity, better quality sights and perhaps the ammo (9x19 mm) which is a far more versatile ammo than 7.62x25. However, weapons with rotating barrel mechanism (CF98, Stoeger Cougar) will always remain vulnerable to occasional failures to feed due to the reasons I have already explained in one of the threads.

(119450, ' @new_b\nwelcome to Pakguns.\n\nI have Few Suggestions\n\n1. Never start your weapon practice from SD/HD, that will move you in a greater hurdle. And Handguns, very often never hit the target in unexperienced hands. So that will put u in jeopardy and a crossfire from the attacker side who is well aware of the use of guns will be dangerous for you.\n\n2. Safety precautions are the best things and Gun use should be avoided for SD/HD as much as possible unless not very much required. If you cannot afford Security Cameras, I am sure you can afford Locking your Doors and not opening them unnecessary.  And do not unnecessary go out of the home.\n\n3. If you are new to this area and some peoples are saying to you bad lines about it, then Brother these must be rumors. I hardly heard anything happening in this area, its a very very Safe and Secure area. There are all kinds of people living in this area, Low Class, Middle Class and Very High Class. Even, xPM Z.Jamali lives here.\n\n4. You mentioned that you are everytime on work and you want to buy the gun for your Old Dad and lil sis. If you are not in the Home then How can you defend them ? \n\n5. Buy a Long Knive with Sharp Blades and a PepperSpray and give them to your sis and dad.\n\n\nLastly, 13d/2 is a Very Secure Area\n\nRegards,', ''),

(119494, ' [quote=LionHeart]...............Here is my experiences with my Shadow 1000 since I bought it.  I have got it along with the Tasco 4x32 Scope (Chinese) but was not mounted so I adjusted/align its iron sights, after few shots it was done and I started enjoying its accuracy on Tins, Lizards, Matchboxes, Glass Coke Bottles etc etc.  After couple of days I think of using its scope and mounted it but it gave my hard time while zeroing it, weeks/days gone it but this zeroing process never ends because every after 20-30 shots it looses zero so now I am really sick of doing this zeroing things so have unmounted this scope.  This weekend I managed some free time and did some target practicing with open iron sights. At first run aligned its iron sights (Crouching position and rested the gun on chair, distance was around 15m and used Gamo Match Pellets. Sorry didn''t manage any photo shoot but will try next time) In first run 4 shots fired having really tight ground  3 shots were linked with each other and 4th one was also almost there but all was hitting 3 inches low of the bull.  Actually i was trying to align both front and rear sights even elevation of the rear sight was max high even then i am hitting this low at 15m. So in my 2nd run I started focusing only the front sight and get surprised with my next 3 shots which was right at the one inch bull and was linked with each other but here''s the misery started when the 4th shot goes to the left followed by every next shot and more to the left up and down in the same session.  (every thing was same abut what went wrong ?)  Anyway i decided to give some rest to my eyes and started searching for any other smaller object can be use as a target finally got this idea of using dead batteries and found few small AA sized batteries and couple of Jumbo sized batteries. So placed them at same distance and back to my same position and started with the AA small once.  Fist 3 shots right on target all 3 smaller batteries flew but when it comes to the Big one i fired 3 shots but was unable to hit the Fatter one and i was like .... What the HELL is happening  :mad:      I have just knocked down 3 smaller with 3 shots but not be able to do with the bigger cell even in 3 shots  :/    So i end-up my day with this mystery  :rolleyes: [/quote]\n\nI think Skeeter60 sahib would be able to give a better advice. \n\nLast week after my target shooting, I decided to shoot a few bricks with my Viking. There were five bricks (dist was approx 25 m). With first 4 shots, I smashed 4 bricks in quick time. Fifth brick I missed. Tried again but again missed. Got angry at myself and fired two more shots but missed both. Now I was getting frustrated and embarrassed (with range guys looking hard at me). So I aimed hard and shot again but again missed. I fired 10 bullets but could not hit the damn brick :( The range guy came to me and advised me to rest. I sat down on the chair and had a cold drink. Got up and shot the brick............. bang. So need not worry brother, it happens to everyone :) \n\nNow technically speaking, if the first few shots are accurate but subsequent shots go astray with an almost new good quality airgun, more than the gun, it may be because of the shooter  loosing concentration or getting tired. You may try building up your shooting stamina (yes, there is shooting stamina as well :)). Do dry firing exercise. Just aim, hold your breath and don''t press the trigger. Keep the aim and dont breath, till your arms start shivering or you cant hold your breath anymore. This will increase your shooting stamina. And one more thing, making 1 inch groups consistently from 25 M is not at all easy. It normally takes years of practice. So be patient and practice hard. \n\nRegarding any mechanical flaw in the air gun which is the second possibility, I can''t really say for sure as I am no expert on airguns. Skeeter60 sahib or some other knowledgeable member may be able to advice better :)', ''),

And off course box had 3 grips in it.\n\n@Adeel i paid too much 235 because Tipu had 5 pieces and would not bulge and i just had to have it.  BTY Harris has it also asking 250.  I called Tpu today to ask if any left.  He informs me 1 left.  I asked him price and he replied "sir why u worry u have one and enjoy it".  So i didn''t bother to quiz.\n\nRegards', ''),

Also thanks for sharing your part of experiencing of not hitting your target after few successful shots so i will keep this resting thing in mind as well but mine case is a bit confusing so need to be check/confirm this mechanical flaw first.  Let say i will give rest myself between sessions so the gun would be on rest automatically and then it would be difficult to trace/confirm this particular mechanical flaw ...  :/        So now waiting for our [b]Sir Skeeter60[/b] for his valuable feedback?\n\nWhat I am thinking now to first I would clean/lube properly (full maintenance procedure) after that will start this target practicing then will check for any flaw.  I hope it would be only the matter of proper cleaning/lube and the rifle would be good to go. \n\nIn this regard I did some browsing yesterday to find out this particular/critical "Air Chamber Oil/Lube which is difficult to find in our local markets" along with some other kinds of lube (for main spring and for bore/barrel)\n\n[b]@KF: [/b]   Brother  so far I came to know some important things regarding Spring Air Rifle Lubricants. Let me start with the most important/critical things which is;\n\n\n[b]"Air Chamber Oil/Lube"[/b]\n\n1. It should be [b]non-petroleum based Lubricant[/b]  (any petroleum based lube can cause Dieseling while decompressing process and may damage Piston Seal or Chamber)\n\n2. Lubricant [b]should be Silicone based[/b] which would be able to apply a thin layer of Moly to chamber''s walls that will reduce friction.\n\n3. I have found 2 opposite opinion regarding the use of [b]Synthetic Oil [/b]  Some where is written Thin Synthetic Oil can be used as "Air Chamber Lube" and  some where is said  Synthetic Oil shouldn''t be use.     So  :| \n\n4. It should be the High Flash Point Lubricant (synthetic motor oil are high flash point but not sure can be used or not).\n\n\n[b]"Bore Cleaner/Lube and Main Spring Lubricant"[/b]\n\nAs per my little knowledge/search I think we can use any good quality Ordinary Rifle''s bore Cleaner/Lube to clean/lubricate our air rifle''s barrels from inside and same Lubricant can be used for lubricating its Main Spring (Use of Special Hard Oil for Spring would be appropriate). \n\n\n[b]@Brother 12guage:[/b]     Kion Sir jee ....... Apniyan Doo Chawaniyan Athay Wi Sut Dao  :rolleyes:      Horay KiniyanK Aakathiyan Kitiyan Hoyian Ne   :D   \n\n\nLooking forward to your feedback in this regard (what/which Lube can be used for what/which Different Parts) ?  \nWhat about [b]ATF Fluid (Transmission or Automatic Transmission Oil) Or Synthetic Power Steering Fluid [/b] Can it be used anywhere in Air Rifle Maintenance?\n\nI just read all that thread again (Pakguns Cleaner/Lubricant) and now sure about "PG Cleaner/Lubricant" is perfect for bore cleaning and lubrication and  Wonder Lube/PG Lube is perfect for Main Spring Lubrication  BUT  What about "AIR CHAMBER OIL" ?    Can we use this PG lubricant as Air chamber oil ?  I am concerning about its piston seal ?', ''),

If you admire a friend''s gun and tell him so, he will probably let you try it out a few times. \n\n#7. Your primary gun doesn''t mind if you keep another gun for a backup. \n\n#6. Your gun will stay with you even if you run out of ammo. \n\n#5. A gun doesn''t take up a lot of closet space.\n\n#4. Guns function normally every day of the month. \n\n#3. A gun doesn''t ask , "Do these new grips make me look fat?" \n\n#2. A gun doesn''t mind if you go to sleep after you use it. \n\nAnd the number one reason a gun is favored over a woman.... \n\n#1.

I mean even the Vikings that had consecutive serial numbers had so much difference between them that one could easily mark them as fake or brand them as totaly different models.\n\nthat day, we saw different safety switches. different locking blocks. we even saw a baikal with polished stainless steel locking block and rails. we even saw a baikal with totally different shaped polymer frame. i''m not talking about quality wise different, i''m talking about a totally different shape. it even had different grip enhancing serrations. then there was the slide release lever. in few vikings, this level was totally different and was more like the Yargin Grach''s level which is flush fit to the frame instead of Viking''s protruding lever.\n\nnow if my memory serves me right, this particular Viking that Doktar Sb. has purchased should have last three digits of the serial number above 900 but less than 1100. is that right?\n\nRegards.', ''),

They were geniuses but also had childhood mental illness called Attention Deficient Hyperactivity disorder or ADHD. Einstein and other could not pass their grade school and according to different sources Einstein almost was expelled from the third grade because being daydreaming and not paying attention in the class. Thomas Edison could n’t sit still in the class and had no concentration and his education ended with three months schooling and kicked out from the school, yet had over 1000 patent to his name. Winston Churchill was at the bottom of his 4th grade class and changed three schools blaming the teachers were no good, yet became the savior of England at the hand of Hitler.\n	So, what was going on with these people? They had ADHD, now we know. Usualy starting at age three, ADHD child is overly hyper, fidget, fails to pay attention, make careless errors, neither follow through on instructions nor complete the tasks, trouble organizing school work or task, frequently looses pens, Pencils, tools needed for activities, easily distracted by external activities, inappropriately run around, climbs, always on the go (driven), and talks excessively, never let anyone talk and blurt out answers before question is finished.\n	Theses children are labeled as “lazy, low intelligent, incapable of learning, and rebellious”. ADHD was discovered in 1902 but not diagnosed as a mental disorder until now, and had no proper treatment. It was assumed that child with this disorder will not be anything but a common laborer and will not be able to read or write let alone will become scientist and inventor.\n	Psychiatry had come logway to understand this disorder. we now understand  ADHD and is treated successfully. Still, we have do n’t know what causes this disorder. In my professional opinion, when teacher complain about a child student is being lazy or poor learner, the parents should  consult   a capable doctor for exact reasoning why a child is performing poorly in the school.', ''),

DP51 is manufactured by Daewoo Precision Industries of South Korea. It is a [b]compact, lightweight [/b]pistol with [b]unique “Fast Action”[/b] an unconventional trigger mechanism. This gun has got 3 actions DA, SA and the FA “Fast Action”. The frame is composed of an aluminum alloy with a matte finish, while the slide is of blued steel.\n\nThe unique [b]“Fast Action" trigger mechanism[/b] allows the [b]hammer[/b] to be [b]decocked[/b] while still keeping the [b]mainspring compressed.[/b] A [b]light pull [/b]on the trigger causes the hammer to [b]flick back [/b]so quickly, after which the pistol would behave in [b]conventional single-action [/b](SA) mode. To [b]activate [/b]the Fast Action, rack the slide, this will place the bullet in the chamber and the hammer will fall back for stick. Simple WITHOUT touching or pulling back the trigger, just simple pushing back the hammer to rest position will engage the “Fast Action” mechanism. A light pull on the trigger will cause the hammer to flick back so quickly, after which the pistol would behave in conventional single-action.\n\nThe pistol can also be fired in conventional single- and double-action (DA) modes. The "fast action" mode allows the trigger travel of DA mode and the trigger weight of SA mode. This allows a more accurate first shot due to the lighter weight of the trigger. The factory magazines hold 13-rounds. The pistol also has an ambidextrous safety and 3-dot sights. It is also equipped with a firing pin block which (as its name implies) blocks the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled.\n\nI had this beauty with me for some time and then one day one of my cousins of mine used it on the range and that was the last time that I handled the DP51. I have been thinking to get one again and hopefully in near future. In my experience DP51 has got the accuracy level same like Cougar.\n\nDP51 is the CCW for one of the Dealer mentioned here in this thread. :)', ''),

(120272, ' [b]@ Usama:[/b]\n\nSir I''m no expert on reloading but would like to offer my comments (and wait for more expert members to comment later on)\n\n1. Reloading equipment is not easily available.\n\n2. Sizing the brass means, ''Sizing it back into its original size, after it has been fired''. The brass case expands after it has been fired. To size it back, you need special equipment!(like a press, right sized dies for your gun cal, lub pastes etc)\n\n3. Polishing / colouring the case with nail polish or some other colour. I think that chambering and extracting of such a round will scratch its paint and leave some in the chamber as well. That is not desired at all, and the chamber side of the barrel must be cleaned thoroughly before any live round firing.\n\nAnother method (somewhat dangerous) is to tap the projectile lightly and loosen it and take it out. Empty the case from any propellant and re-crimp the projectile back.(before re-crimping, get rid of the live primer by the following method) This way the sizing will not be required!\n\nNow the problem of the live primer! Well I''ve never done it on a handgun round but did the following on rifles. After tapping out the projectile, the empty case was chambered and the rifle fired! You can then knock out the primer and do the Shoe Goo stuff!\n\n\nJust my two cents on the topic,\nRegards', ''),

We had a wonderful time at the range (wow, in 45 degrees, we were sweating like a horse, drinking like a mule but still shooting and shooting and shooting). Off the range, we had wonderful discussions on guns and for a change of taste, on many non-gun related topics as well. Wonderful company, I really enjoyed my discourse with these fine gentlemen and thank them again for taking the trouble to travel all the way from Lahore in this scorching heat. Thumbs up to you guys :)\n\nNow here is the first gun.

Solid construction, quite accurate and no stoppages. A rugged and reliable gun. Its high magazine capacity has being portrayed as a big plus and may be absolutely true as well but in my humble opinion, the shape and balance of the handgun would have been far better with a smaller magazine (hence a smaller grip). Please see the dimensions of the gun. Its not very long but quite high and wide. It''s large size grip section will make it a difficult gun to conceal (with a 4 inch barrel, it should be much more concealable than what it is now or it may have a bigger barrel so that accuracy can be enhanced). Overall, a very nice and solid gun to have. \n\n[b]OVERALL ACCURACY RATING.................. FAIRLY ACCURATE[/b]', ''),

However, this photo session was marred by an unpleasant occurrence; as I uncased the gun, I noticed the screws on the folding stock covered in a film of rust. To my horror, the front of the barrel and the front sight also suffered the same affliction to a greater degree. Forgetting all about the photo session, me and Abba started off with an oily rag to minimize the damage to a certain degree... success was not 100% but we did manage to remove most of the surface rust. I suspect that the gun metal was damaged due to rainwater seepage. In my opinion, a brand-new gun has been permanently ruined... :(. I can only take hope in the fact that the functionality of the gun has not been affected, as the innards seem to be totally rust free.\n\nAnyhow, it seemed unfair to have this gun out and not take photos of it.

(120415, ' Thanks for the comments, SA, abbasdurrani, AAH, MAK786, ABY, miantaimur :)\n\nMy use of burlap stems from the need of having a neutral colored and textured background. You will notice from my earlier photos that [i]almost[/i] all of my gun photos have burlap used in the background. This time around, I was looking for something different... but in the end decided... "...why try and fix something when it''s not broken..."\n\nBurlap is best used when a natural light source (e.g. daylight through the windows, in my case) is available. When flash is used as a main light source, or even as a secondary source, the effect is usually ruined. For a few shots, I even had to go prone to get the best stability and avoid camera shake.\n\nAs for being well-kept... well, this gun has been hardly used... possibly taken out more times for cleaning than anything else. It has spent almost all of its life hiding behind a cupboard or under a bed... :P\n\nBtw, the front swivel attachment is not original. The original sling was a thin leather affair. We got a sling off a used bag, modified the front sling attachment point, got some swivels to go along with it... and there you have it! A nice modern sling on an old gun. With this sling, one barely feels the weight of the gun while walking around.', ''),

A blend of good finish on the metal parts and that awesome turkish wooden stock . But the fly in the ointment is that no spare barrel with the luxano. On the cheaper end we have the choice on Akkar pump action  combo . And last but not the least i also have my sights on the chinese Hawk industries remimgton 870clone ( may be i buy a 3rd one too).

I would suggest that you go for Hatsan Escort Combo.\n\n[b]Option 5: (totally disregarding your concerns, kindly accept my apologies)[/b]\n\nwell, hmmm.... now i''m not considering your objectives at all. i''m only looking at your world from my point of view. you have a dedicated HD shotgun which probably sits more and gets little use. obviously! its a HD gun. what can you expect? its supposed to be that way. now to make your collection more complete (or wholesome) you need a semi auto shotgun that you''ll use and abuse (to have fun obviously). a semi auto shotgun serves all purposes well. from skeet to trap and from upland to waterfowl hunting. \n\nin (budget category) semi-auto shotgun world. kindly look at two brands, Baikal MP153 or Hatsan Escort Luxano. both are equally priced. one is ugly, heavy and less finished and other is beautiful, light weight and better finished. one is durable other is slightly less durable. choice is yours.\n\nNow decide which road to take. whichever way you decide, [b]Best of luck![/b]\n\nRegards.', ''),

(120594, ' [b]AoA Everybody[/b]\n\nUsually I do not post articles that I stumble upon while surfing but after reading this particular piece i thought why not make an exception this time. The author in the article is demonstrating proper/recommended/appropriate way of lubricating a SIG Sauer Pistol. Since CZ999 Scorpion and Norinco NP22 handguns are infact SIG based handguns therefore same lubrication principles should apply.\n\n*****************************************************************************\n[u][url]http://grayguns.com/lubrication-of-sig-sauer-pistol-rails/[/url][/u]\n*****************************************************************************\n[b]Lubrication of Sig Sauer pistol rails[/b]\nAugust 19, 2009 by Scott Folk (Former Employee)\n\nThis article is about what I personally recommend for lubricating Sig Sauer pistols. I have different methods for lubricating other guns, but this article is focused on the Sig Sauer pistols.\n\nMy philosophy: If metal rubs metal, it needs grease between the parts.\n\nWe lubricate guns simply to allow the parts that rub on one another to move smoothly. Modern combat handguns are not intended to be run without lubrication. One of our customers made this mistake recently and is now spending a lot of additional money to get his gun in working order after degreasing his gun and dry firing 1,000 times after it came back from Grayguns.\n\n[b]Application of grease[/b]\nI had an empty “Shooter’s Choice” syringe sitting around so I filled it with my favorite grease. Any method of application will work just fine. I use about half-ounce of grease a day while working on guns. I was in need of a way to keep grease readily available without having to unscrew the top of a jar or bottle and I found the syringe to work perfectly for me. What I like best about the syringe is that I can put the grease directly where I want it, such as inside certain springs and the corners of frame rails.\n[img]http://grayguns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ggi-grease-rails-1.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Product options[/b]\nAny gun-grade grease will do the trick. I personally prefer to use Brian Enos’ Slide Glide, Shooter’s Choice grease including a cool syringe for later use or Lubriplate found at Brownells.com. The grease in the following pictures is a lithium/moly-based grease that I’m experimenting with, details available soon.\n\n[img]http://grayguns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ggi-grease-rails-2.jpg[/img]\n\nI’ve applied most of the grease to the underside of the frame rail completely filling the top inside corner. This is critical along the length of the rails because most of the force of recoil lifts the slide and applies force backward and upward against the underside of the frame rails.\n\n[img]http://grayguns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ggi-grease-rails-3.jpg[/img]\n\nNotice how there is a greater amount of grease near the muzzle end of the gun than at the rear. This is intentional. There is only so much space in the tolerance of the pistol for lubrication to reside. Since the slide goes on back to front it’ll push the remaining grease to the back of the frame and bunch it up on the back of the slide when the slide it closed.\n\nYou can see that I didn’t use as much grease on the side of the rails as I did on the underside, this is purely because it’s not generally necessary.\n\nThe top also gets a layer of grease to protect against galling and excess friction.\n\nMore pictures and more information will be posted in the coming days, and I provided detailed shots on applying grease to the pistol’s internals as well.\n\n[b]Different mission, different approach[/b]\nFor my every day carry (EDC) I grease the rails, put the slide on, run the action a couple of times, remove the slide then wipe the rails off to remove the large amount of bulk. I leave the grease on the under side of the rails alone when I wipe them off, the slide normally holds enough grease to keep things running.\n\nFor an EDC, remember your gun goes everywhere you do and is exposed to everything you are, hot, cold, humidity, dust, taco shells from that ill advised taco you ate while trying to talk on your cell phone while driving last week….everything. So if you have grease squirting out of every crevasse on the gun, you’ll be attracting the general detritus of every day life into your gun. Generally, that crap doesn’t generally make it in far enough to do any kind of damage unless you’re irresponsible enough to never clean your carry gun.\n\nFor open carry EDC for law enforcement, you gotta start thinking a bit more. I’ve had a couple of cops bring me their duty pistols for work and I’ve been astonished at what I’ve found. When I cocked the hammer of one of them, I found three pieces off bitten of finger nail and a corner of plastic from a plastic ketchup packet….I mean WTF MAN! Clean your freaking gun.\n\nI asked how long it thad been since he last cleaned it and he told me it had been a couple years, “I hardly ever use it, I figured it was still pretty clean” was his excuse. His gun was absolutely bone dry, I actually found dust on the frame rails as opposed to lube.\n\nThat brings me to another subject, cleaning. Here’s what I recommend.\n\n[b]Competition[/b]\nClean it after every 200 to 400 rounds. Most of the time a big match or a day of shooting will be enough of a work out that your gun will need cleaning.\n\n[b]EDC with frequent use including open carry[/b]\nClean it after every time you use it. If you’re going to depend on that gun to save your life, you want it to work the first time you pull the trigger, so keep it clean and lubed.\n\n[b]EDC with little to no use[/b]\nClean your gun at least once a month. More of the same of your gun being needed to save your life. Even without use, your gun needs to be cleaned and relubricated, so give it a quick bath and make sure it’s ready when you need it. There are 720 hours in a 30 day month, I think you can afford to spend 1/720 of a month cleaning your gun every month, it’s cheap insurance.\n*****************************************************************************\n[u][url]http://grayguns.com/lubrication-of-sig-sauer-pistol-rails/[/url][/u]\n*****************************************************************************\n\nRegards.', ''),

(120679, ' [quote=Topak]nice and informative.......\nSir will not grease collect dust according to our climate and surroundings?[/quote]\n\nTopak Bro, any lubricant regardless of nature would collect dirt and residue. its in the very nature of a viscous fluid. grease or oil has nothing to do with it. from purely lubrication standpoint, oil will always be better than grease however when we consider load on the metal-metal contact surfaces and adhesion to those metal surfaces, grease would beat oils hands down. no doubt about it.\n\nany benefits that one gets from using oil are nullified when oil migrates and leaves the place it is supposed to lubricate. there is a reason why engines have oil pump that continuously pump oil from oil-pan to heads. the biggest advantage of using grease is that it stays put and quality (modern) greases are as effective as (modern) lubricating oils.\n\nas a general rule of thumb. always oil fast moving surfaces and always grease contact surfaces that experience high loads. in handguns, trigger mechanism and finer springs and sprockets should always get a light coating of oil whereas slide/frame rails, barrel (outside only), slide to trigger interface should always get a light coating of a quality grease.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. there is a reason why engines are lubricated using oils (fast moving/high RPM) whereas axle joints are greased (slow moving but high load bearing). one more thing: grease itself is nothing more than oil molecules (mineral or synthetic) suspended in a soap. quality greases usually have other additives such as molybedenum disulphide or teflon to give it enhanced lubrication ability.', ''),

Well guyz, as you all know, I''ve been terribly missing a proper holster for my PT 145, which has literally been boxed in the closet for long, coz I wasn''t really satisfied with my earlier leather holster, especially not during these humid days.\n\nOur respected bro, Denovo Sir, knew my problem and has been attending it silently, until today, when he was courteously kind to call me up to attend the local Leopards Courier office for collection of this package: \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVU4D90][img]http://s4.postimage.org/U4D90.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAnd the inner packing:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqfb5Tr][img]http://s3.postimage.org/fb5Tr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqfbfS0][img]http://s3.postimage.org/fbfS0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nAnd the "[b]BIKINI[/b]" for "Karishma" 145 :lol: :\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqfbpQA][img]http://s3.postimage.org/fbpQA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe rear side:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqfbRh9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/fbRh9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAnd my PT 145:\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsDu3e9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/Du3e9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVU5l2A][img]http://s4.postimage.org/U5l2A.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsDqOHr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/DqOHr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nFinally dressed up:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVU5xwi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/U5xwi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxMzxbr][img]http://s1.postimage.org/Mzxbr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqfcVD0][img]http://s3.postimage.org/fcVD0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsDrwB0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/DrwB0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThanks a lots Denovo bro, this Karishma has indeed been "shying" away since long, crying for "freedom", now she can accompany me with comfort and ease, this was a badly needed item, very considerate of you to do me this great favor! :)\n\nThe holster is indeed one nice item, special sized for the Springfield and Taurus Mil series. The gun "clicks" in, and can only be withdrawn in [b]one fast movement[/b] by only[b] ONE [/b]angle! No "jerking" to the sides, no slow movement, just [b]PULL[/b] it out! One get''s adjusted to this movement, and it''s beneficial coz no-one else will be able to snatch your gun away with ease. :cool: :P\n\nThere''s a retention screw and it''s therefore fully adjustable, I had to loosen the screw up a bit for the PT 145 to seat in properly.\n\nFurthermore, it got a very nice "hold on" to the hips , the gun doesn''t move away from you, making it even more concealable.\n\nHave really been able to upgrade my guns this week, first by the Cougar grips sent in by Naveed, now the .45 by the help of Den. Thanks guyz, you''re really great buddies, indeed. :)\n\nHope you enjoyed. :)', ''),

I also checked here and there on the web, but could not find a Martini with sights with shape that resemble the rear sights of your gun. That completely shoots down my idea of utilizing the rear sight markings to identify the gun. Though the markings on your gun''s rear sight seem unique to me.\n\nThe receiver on your gun and its lever have me convinced that your gun is a Henry-Martini design; if anyone thinks otherwise, please share your thoughts.\n\nThat said, we are no further along the way to identifying your gun.

(120946, ' Mr Gilani\n\nI second you.\nThe 2 Z and 1 Z  I only heard of in 1969 when we had some Sten Machine Carbines and Walther P38 Pistols which had alloy slides and a  steel breach  plug. As these faded away I never heard of the damn 1 Z again. There were some SMCs till 1982 but then all were junked.\nNever heard of 1 Z; only on the forum I hear about it I either did not notice  or there never was any 1Z made after 1984 to my humble knowledge  only the experts at our forum seem to be acquainted with it. The 2Z is not +P as having miked the 115 grain er at 1250 I personally do not consider it + P as so many companies are giving same ballistics, the US 9mm (mily ) is 124 grains  at the velocity of 1300 FPS and giving a hefty 485 ft lbs of energy compared to ours at around 398 ft lbs . The US 9mm is being fired in the fragile Beretta  ( every  6000 rounds the slide is inspected for cracks ).\nBy the way the pressure is supposed to be at a  constant value and it has to be kept  with in  the same  safe level. \n\nBy using a larger amount of  slower propellant higher velocities are achieved, this slow powder gives a more sustained  pressure curve  thereby accelerating the bullet to a higher velocity. (peak pressure remains same )\n\nThough the pressure does not increase beyond the SAAMI limits the force of BOLT THRUST is much higher and a only a strong and well designed pistol will thrive on a steady diet of such ammo without any damage to its frame, slide or the shooters handsome face.', ''),

So lastly I have to bought a .30 pistol bore cleaning brush and a 12gauge bore brush with the idea of cutting them up-to my desired size make them fit so can be use in my .22 gamo rifle and I will make push rod separately that would be appropriate for .22 bore. \n\nSo this is the current situation of our local markets even for simple ordinary cleaning accessories           :mad:', ''),

I''m thinking since these typical evils are associated with firearms only so there is not need for a firearm specific cleaner. PG cleaner would definitely be an overkill for the job. you are more likely to ruin the rubber parts (I''m told that airguns have rubber parts in them) as PG cleaner contains some pretty strong solvents. STAY AWAY!. a simple hose down with WD40 should be good enough for the job.\n\nas far as lubrication is concerned, we are not talking about firearms. not heat, no drastic change in temperatures (narrow temperature spectrum), no combustion so using PG lubricant is also a bad idea cause it is mineral oil based (ATF) and would destroy the rubber components. a silicone based oil would be more appropriate for the job.\n\nRegards.', ''),

The barrel has to be angled in a such a way that at a particular distance, the bullet paths cross each other. They are expensive, and rightly so, due to the amount of work put into them.\n\nThe double-barreled bolt-action in the video found by Nabeel bro may be the answer to a hunter''s dream... some hunters prefer double-barrels, which give them an immediate second shot capability (not present in bolt-action rifles), without chances of jamming (semi-automatic rifles, in particular those chambered for larger calibers, [i]can[/i] jam).

(121239, ' article from site mentioned in this thread\n\n"\ntom from Afghanistan, 22 March 10\n\nI am curruntly at a small infantry outpost about 100 miles outside of Kandahar where we train Army Afghan forces. At this FOB, Afghan forces are not issued or trained with hand guns here, but that is not to say that they are issued at some other time to them. They are issued non-USA military shot guns and multipal versions of the AK-47 and what ever else has been found in the stockpiles that were found here years ago.\n\nAfghan forces here are only used as gaurds in gaurds towers, and once trained they are sent somewhere else for continued training and to start going on missions with US forces. We use non military afghany personal as interpreters. I personally have not seen US trained Afghany feild soldiers, using Maks or any other hand gun. I have only seen US trained Afghanistan officers authorized to carry sidearms, using Makarov''s.\n\nI have seen however, many NATO forces using the standard Makarov, including Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkish, Karsovo and some French soldiers using Maks, the French issued are not I don''t know. To see NATO forces and the weapons that they use you have to be at an International Nato Coalition operation center where everyone is or out in the field with Nato forces at some point. The only Nato forces, that I have seen not using Mak''s are the Canadian, British, and Spain. Again, this is only what I have seen or experienced. I know there may be different stories out there of what other soldiers have seen somewhere else.\n\nI have spent several months at the Southern regional Afghanistan coalition forces NATO opperation center and were able to talk and meangle with many soldiers from the NATO forces. Guess what, most of them are using the Makarov as a side arm. WOW? I guess alot of the Nato countries also feel the its hard to improve a great pistol like the Makarov and thats why it is still being used after all these years.\n\nIt is good to know that all the countries that I mentioned are still using the standard Makarov. It only prooves how good the Makarov is. Its hard to improve a great design like the Mak. But, one thing that I have realized about other countries and the Mak. The Mak is not something to collect, for most of the soldiers I have talked to, its just a sidearm to them. To be issued, used, turned back in and thats it.\n\nIt''s not a craz, to collect as many as you can like it is in America. They to realize that it is an excellent weapon, but to them it''s just that a tool, a weapon, a life saver, not a collection piece. Most of the coalition forces soldiers that I have talked to want and to collect US made guns. Maybe it''s the same thing in reverse.\n\n"', ''),

(121267, ' Skeeter60 Sir. \nI agree that absence of a firing pin retracting spring may cause an accident if one is in habit of carrying live round in the chamber. But for those who do not carry a round in the chamber, Mak is a safe pistol in my view. \n\nRemember you wanted to take out and through away the safety of my Makarov. I stopped you because of only one reason. My Mak would have looked ugly without a safety catch. Otherwise, you know I dont like safeties and would not need them in most of the pistols that I carry. You also know I hardly ever carry a round in the chamber because I believe with a round in the chamber, it''s never 100% safe, no matter what the safety mechanism might be. And in 99% situations, I know that I will always have enough time to rake the slide and shoot. \n\nIn my humble opinion therefore, safety lies more in the mind and habits of a shooter and not really in the mechanical parts of a gun. I have seen accidents with those handguns which are supposed to have a very reliable safety mechanism. I know many would not agree to this argument but this is how I feel about safety. \n\nNow coming back to Makarov, its safety does not bother me. What it gives me on the side of accuracy, reliability and size is something that I can only get in Sig P239, HK2000sk, Kahr K9 or MK9, Glock 26, CZ2025 Rami and the likes (I am not including .32 ACP models here as I feel they are under powered). Being recoil operated hand, I have a hunch that some of the above pistols may not be as accurate as blow back operated Makarov. However, [b]all these pistols cost 6-12 times the price of Makarov.[/b] Frankly, [b]in this affordable price range, I don''t find another genuine CC handgun which can provide me this level of accuracy and reliability[/b]. :) \n\nregards and happy traveling :)', ''),

I have scrapped three P7m13 pistols just bacuase over prolonged use they could not sustain the unusually high chamber pressures. I grade P7s as one of the best ever pistols.\nThe round is designed to cycle the MP5 bolt and carrier which takes a lot more rearward push than that of pistols. If the rounds were good for pistols, POF would have never ever had two varients under parallel production.\nMost of the modern pistols as mentioned by a dear fellow member can take thousands of rounds of P2Z but that comes at a cost. There is a definate difference in the propellent mix and the jerk one feels by firing these different varients.\nI will not recommend it to be used in pistols and please dont ever try to use them in darra made pistols , have seen the slide of one come right off.\nRegards\nBloodBath', ''),

I have scrapped three P7m13 pistols just bacuase over prolonged use they could not sustain the unusually high chamber pressures. I grade P7s as one of the best ever pistols.\nThe round is designed to cycle the MP5 bolt and carrier which takes a lot more rearward push than that of pistols. If the rounds were good for pistols, POF would have never ever had two varients under parallel production.\nMost of the modern pistols as mentioned by a dear fellow member can take thousands of rounds of P2Z but that comes at a cost. There is a definate difference in the propellent mix and the jerk one feels by firing these different varients.\nI will not recommend it to be used in pistols and please dont ever try to use them in darra made pistols , have seen the slide of one come right off.\nRegards\nBloodBath[/quote]\n\nBloodBath brother, thanks for your comments. :)\n\nPOF website quotes following data:\n\n[b]Cal [/b]                                [b]Base marking[/b]      [b]Mean velocity[/b]     [b]Accuracy M.F.M.[/b]       [b]Wt of Ctgs[/b]\n9 mm Ball Parabellum  	      9mm 2Z  	             395 m/s       76.2 mm at 15.24 m         12.57 grams  	\n9 mm Walther Pistol  	      9 mm 1Z  	             341 m/s       254x152mm at 25m         12.56 	\n\n[url]http://www.pof.gov.pk/products.htm#[/url]\n\nThis clearly shows that the difference in MV is 54 m/s. The chamber pressure generated by both the ctgs is not given. Obviously, 2Z generates more chamber pressure than 1Z. \n\nNow why POF has an ammo specially made for "Walther'' pistol. This is because Walther P38, which has an alloy slide, could not take the pressure generated by 2Z and slides of many Walther pistols cracked (this happened in 60s). Hence Walthers were fed with 1Z which generated comparatively less pressure. That was the era when most 9mm pistols, though otherwise very well constructed, were not designed to fire high pressure rounds. But during mid 70s and 80s onwards, we saw a lot of high pressure rounds of different types being introduced commercially and accordingly, the slides, chambers, springs and other parts of most modern pistols were designed to fire these loads. \n\nNow the question arises " Is POF2Z a safe ammo to be used with all 9 mm pistols?".\n\nSkeeter60 sahib has fired hundreds of thousands (yes, many lacks) of 2Z with his Glocks, CZ75 and Sig P226 for well over two decades. He chronographed 2Z and found it in the range of 1250-1290 ft / sec (381-390 m/s). This is less than many commercially available US made +P and +P+ loads which we otherwise use in our handguns. Skeeter60 sahib told me that normally he would change his Glock after firing 50-60 k rounds. I don''t exactly remember but I would have also fired well over 20K 2Z rounds from different handguns in the last two decades or more. With few guns, I fired thousands of 2Z. We never had a problem with 2Z. Off course there is a difference in recoil but except a few low quality handguns, all modern guns are designed to take it.        \n\nPOF2Z should preferably be avoided with very old handguns, handguns with alloy slide and handguns of weak or un-confirmed make. Not only POF2Z, most other JHPs and other high pressure ammos should also not be fired from such guns. But with guns like Glock, CZ75 (and clones), Sig (and clones), Baikal MP446, CZ999, Taurus PT92/99, Beretta 92FS, Stoeger Couger, most chinese pistols etc, there should not be a problem. However, a shooter himself is the best judge to see what type of handgun he is using and should accordingly select the ammo. :) \n\nAnd sorry to hear about your P7s but could there be some other reason also? And are you talking about earlier models of P7 which were inducted in SSG in lates 60s / early 70s?? \n\nregards', ''),

It''s more challenging for sure as one has to be more accurate with his shots. Good for quails, doves, even partridges and the likes but the shot has to be well aimed. Hardly any recoil, a pleasure to shoot. Not really good enough for skeet shooting.

(121560, ' For a kid, a new toy is better than an old toy. For this kid though, the joys of playing around with a repaired old toy far outstrip others.\n\nFor those who don''t know, the Daisy Powerline 880 is a pneumatic pump air rifle, which can shoot both BBs and pellets, of .177 caliber. This rifle is recoil-less and and almost sound free. Apart from the sound of rushing air, the click of a spring, and sometimes, the pellet hitting the target, there is no sound at all. The power of this rifle is variable; controlled by the number of pumps before the shot. The trigger of this air rifle is the BEST I have ever used, air gun or firearm. The phrase, "... the trigger broke like a glass rod..." perfectly fits here in my opinion.\n\nThe rifle I have was bought by my Abba in 1990, for a price of around Rs. 1400 (I still have the original receipt somewhere :D), making this rifle older than myself. After considerable use, it was gifted to me on my 13th birthday, as my very first air gun. Let me state that this is the single, most fired gun in our arsenal, possibly more than all the others put together. (Photos of this gun might be able to show this)\n\nEarly on, I found out that one of the weaknesses of this gun was its slow reload time compared to spring guns. Furthermore, pumping the gun using the lever proved to be quite exhausting after a few shots. Over time, my Daisy started showing problems related to the power of the pump and and started jamming. With the passage of time, and myself acquiring a Gamo Delta, the Powerline 880 fell into disuse, and was pretty much ignored.\n\nFrom time to time, I would get that rifle out, shoot it just for fun and put it back. Until the jamming problem became so severe that hardly 5 shots could be fired without a stoppage.\n\nFor the past 3 to 4 years, I have tried to repair this gun by myself numerous times. I used to take it apart, examine it, and after finding nothing wrong, put it back again. Until the time when the barrel came apart from the chamber, due to excessive force applied to the bolt to seat the pellet.\n\nThis afternoon, I tried another experiment. My idea was to use [i]Magic Depoxy Steel[/i] to reattach the barrel to the chamber. After considerable deliberation and thought, I applied a thin layer of the substance to attach the barrel to the chamber. Happily ever after or so I thought...\n\nUpon testing, I realized that the gun was still jamming. After close examination of the chamber, I came up with this mental image:\n\n[img]http://i710.photobucket.com/albums/ww103/KageFoxOS/Daisy%20Powerline%20880/DaisyP880JammingFix.jpg[/img]\n\nFig. 1 shows the basic barrel and chamber assembly, when the action is open. Note that the air inlet is perpendicular to the chamber.\n\nFig. 2 shows the action closed, after the bolt has pushed in the pellet. Note that the pellet''s "middle" is blocking the air inlet. To me, this was the possible cause of the pellets jamming, even after 10 pumps. The air, in this case, was unable to move the pellet at all.\n\nFig. 3 shows what the position of the pellet should be for the shot to be successful. The pellet should be seated into the mouth of the barrel, or at the very least, should be clearing the air inlet. I assume that the bolt was unable to accomplish this due to several years of wear and tear.\n\nI had an ultra-thin piece of steel rod, around 5-6 inches long, lying about in my random and useless stuff. Using pliers, I twisted it into an [b]L[/b] shape, to make it able to push the pellet in.\n\nI am happy to say that the idea worked out. In all, I have fired around 70 shots through the gun since its "repair". I have only encountered two stoppages, which I believe were my own mistake while pushing in the pellet.\n\nThe Powerline 880 offers a refreshing change from the usual spring-guns. No recoil to worry about, no accuracy-shift problems associated with how one holds the gun. Beautiful trigger, loads better than the Shadow, or perhaps any other Gamo which I have encountered. The gun has great balance, and even after quite some time of being acquainted, it comes to the target like an old friend. \n\nBy the end of the day, I was drenched in sweat, tired as hell, fingers black with lead from Daisy Precision Max pellets... but I was happy that my cherished gun works once more.\n\nPhotos of the gun will be up soon (hopefully on the weekend) as soon as I get out my "other" shooting equipment.\n\nOwners of pneumatic pump air rifles with problems similar to mine might find this experiment useful. I am already planning to "take a look" :P at Abba''s Crosman 1377, which suffers from a problem of a similar nature.\n\n[i]I hope that was not too long...[/i]', ''),

As far as the price range is concerned I persoanlly think this new version is a good buy, compared to turkish 12 gauges availible in our market. \nFrankly the only problem is that most of us , including me are just superstious and tend to reject a weapon , just because it is locally manufactured, which is a negative approach. It is understandable that we do not have any check and balances/ quality control standards, but if some company has taken a positive initiative we as gun enthusiast should support it. \nYou never know may be in a few years this same company might be manufacturing underlicensed weapons for top brands, just like the stogers, most of us are crazy about !\n"Be Pakistani & buy Pakistani" \n:)[/quote]\nmian sahib well explain, i have already written in other relating thread,this gun will better choice along turkish,question is about length of barrel:)', ''),

(121621, ' This is the way I see it from what I''ve read so far here:\n\nIf you want to have a katana, legally you are suppose to have a license for it. But, in many cases, police are probably unaware of the sword law or it is possible to convince them that its decorative therefore you shouldn''t have problems if your a good talker.\n\nAs of swords, a real blade made for practice goes between $200-$2000. Now the lower end Forged blades such as the one I have($500) range from $200 to $700, these are fully functional made of 1045 to 1065 forged carbon steel. The upper levels which are Folded range from $700 to $4000. These are fully functionnal aswell, but are often bought for display purposes are the forged series can still cut through anything without a problem such as my katana.\n\nIn the hands of anyone who isn''t experienced, a $40K blade can be reduce to a $200 within a second. But i''de like to add that most swords of higher prices( above $4K) are traditionally made, forged and made by one of the 50ish officially government licensed families which reside in Japan. These forges from what I''ve read aren''t allowed to make more than 20 Katana''s a year for sale AND most importantly Export policy of Japan strictly forbids any Katana made in Japan to be exported in order to protect its heritage, history and culture. They are actually quite severe of penalties if you do get caught trying to export live blades made in Japan. If your buying a blade I suggest sword buyer guides such as the one a member previously posted in this thread.\n\nMy katana is made by CasHanwei. Outside of Japan, they are the biggest functional sword distributors in the worlds. Most practitioners I''ve seen around my city and Canada in general use CasHanwei swords. I personally have a SH6001LPF from CasHanwei and I have no problem cutting through watermelons and lightweight bamboo with straws ( Kendo )\n\nLastly to all of you whom are willing to buy FUNCTIONAL blades for practice, DO NOT buy them in Pakistan and ONLY buy them through licensed retailers which have reputation in well forged blades. Most blades made for decoration which are often sharpened to give the buyer the impression that it is functional will shatter on impact and can cause SEVERE INJURIES.\nIf your buying them for decorations, go ahead and have a blast, though make sure they are always secured and if your actually exposing the blade to open air, you should lub the blade every 2 months or so to keep it from rusting.(unless its made of stainless steel; which most fake or display blades are made off)\n\nAnyway I still have to figure out how I''m going to get it through the airport in the gun case when I arrive there without having someone totally brilliant trying to confiscate it from me.', ''),

Hence consciously or unconsciously we tend to incline towards imported weapons. I do agree that the metallurgy , finish etc of an imported weapon is amazing but we shouldn''t under rate and classify our indeginiously manufactured goods as sub standard. As we all know that on and off our local industry has produced some amazing jewels for us to fancy and admire.\nIf we expand our scope of discussion to other defense related products being manufactured indegeneously, by organizations like POF. I feel proud to say that most the products are being exported to various countries around the world. Pakistani products are being highly rated , because of their high standards, mainly because of the strict check and balance being adapted by the inspectorate departments.\nSmall arms manufacturing unfortunately has been labeled as a cottage industry and this field is being projected as an unmechanized industry , where everything is done by hand. Although in western countries hand crafted weapons or any other thing which is hand crafted has an immense value considered as a work of art, where are products are called substandard.\nI want to ask all of you, why are Pakistani products so underrated ? \nI understand it is mainly because, the industry couldn''t flourish due to lack of capital investment, adapting new technology, stream lining the manufacturing process, no cooperation from the government to-date and last but not the least sanctions being imposed on Pakistan, now and then ,hence damaging our economy and not letting us prosper as a nation.\nI could keep on going on and on about it , but we would go wayyyyyy of topic :)\n[b]There is a mindset to change and we as pakgunners should try and take the initiative[/b], or atleast support our local products and if we are so unsatisfied , we as a forum of gun lovers and enthusiast should guide the manufacturers and advice them , what we would really want them to do , what to change etc.\nJust a humble suggestion from my end !', ''),

She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious. Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between Kumar and his roommate that met the eye. Reading his mom’s thoughts, Kumar volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Sunita and I are just roommates.”\n\nAbout a week later, Sunita came to Kumar saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I’ve been unable to find the silver chutney jar. You don’t suppose she took it, do you?” Kumar said, “Well, I doubt it, but I’ll email her, just to be sure.”\nSo he sat down and wrote :\nDear Mother:\nI’m not saying that you ‘did’ take the chutney jar from my house, I’m not saying that you ‘did not’ take the chutney jar.

My gun was made right infront of my eyes, they even threw in a 28inch hunting barrel with screw in chokes. lemme say it again: awesomely manufacturered thing.\n\nat the range:\n\nwell, i''m not much of a hunter but i''m totally into skeet. i''m gonna make it short by saying that i''ve personally fired 200 shots in a single sitting without giving the gun a single moment to cool down. and the gun functioned flawless. the barrel was so hot, u could probably light a cigar off it. but the thing just kept on kicking. it gets even more interesting, i thought why not get the barrel tested for surface flaws, u know, with my links it was easy to pull off, the barrel was tested using ultrasonic surface testing and eddy current testing. absolutely flawless after 200 rounds. boy!.\n\n200 rounds might not sound alot but remember it was 200 consecutive bangs in a single sitting. the only rest was involved when the tube magazine was being loaded for another round of punishment. note: there were no cleaning intervals, the barrel was not cleaned during the whole session.\n\nat my brother''s wedding:\n\nme and my cousin fired a total of 150 rounds of SG (00 buck shots). again, no intervals, no resting and cleaning the barrel. she was hot as hell but kept on kicking.\n\nabout the pattern:\n\ngot me a stats genius and we patterened the gun, well, pretty good (it met industry standards), i''m not gonna say awesome, but better than the turkish ones we bought along for comparison. i still have the results with me, and can post them too, both for the short/standard 22 inch barrel and for the custom/28 inch barrel. the stats guy even made me a complex equation by which i can tell where/how will be the pattern at any given distance and choke.\n\nas time passed:\n\nI got me many shotguns now, and now i''m also well experienced in turkish (sarsilmaz, hatsan, volcanic) and russian baikal mp 153.\n\nguess what: at my range, i''m the only guy with Daudson pump and guess what? my club members gladly ask for my gun when they forget to bring their foreign guns, knowing its performace and durability.\n\nand to date, i cannot even count the cartridges i''ve fired, to give an idea: i fire 200-300 rounds a month with my pump. my foreign semi autos are nothing more than cabinet queens now, they just sit and collect dust. I also give/lend them to friends i cannot trust with my precious daudsons pump.\n\nconclusion:\n\nForeign made guns are expensive and probably of higher quality and probably safer to use however my daudson is dirt cheap and definately safe to use. in a contest of "probably" vs "definately", "definately" wins hand down.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(121783, ' Why General Custer was beaten?\nBecause he was an imbecile.\nGeneral  George Armstrong Custer was promoted from Colonel to Lt. General during the Native Americans ( so called Red Indians) wars in 1874. He had been a veteran of war between the states a bloodiest civil war which lasted from 1861-1864. He was Union soldier called Yankee ( Southern were called rebels or rebels). More US soldiers were killed in the civil wars than all the wars that USA had ever been involved until to this day. \n	Custer was not a brilliant commander and but dare devil who won fame during the civil war. However, he became an arrogant, self serving idiot who wanted to be the president of the USA. So, despised all the signs for his defeat at the hand of Indian coalition, Custer attacked coalition of  2 dozens tribes which included, all the Dakotas (Sioux Lakhota  nation and Chyenne). He was supposed to wait until General Crook army had been arrived but Custer wanted the glory for himself alone and attacked the Indians.\n	These Indians were divided into many tribes. It was the first time that American Indians united together against the “pale face” under the leadership of Chief Crazy Horse and the medicine man Sitting Bull. The numbers of Indians were 2000. In 1876 Custer’s 7th cavalry was wiped out by the Indians at a place called Little Big Horn. Custer had only 700 men in his regiment.  \nin Montana territory. It was not the single shot Carbine only but both side used Winchester 66-73 repeating rifle. Indian bought this forbidden weapons from the white smugglers for 5X its price. Indians were not allowed to have rifles. Holly Wood fanaticized Custer and made him a hero but recent research showed that it was the opposite what public was made to believe.\n            If you ever visit the Little Big Horn battle field, you will see a well kept cemetry with a monument in the memory of 7th Cavlary but sadly, there is nothing about Indians who died in that war. However, in 1986, USA governmnet established fund to carve the face of great Indian warrior Chief Crazy Horse along the four president on mount Rushmore, South Dakota.

As of selling it, lol good luck, katanas are legal in Canada, you can walk around with it as long as your blade doesn''t come out of the sheath; though you probably will be stopped by police a couple of times to tell you you shouldn''t be walking around with it.\n\n@Salman: No its not made in Japan, Japanese Law strictly prohibits exports of Katanas from the country and you can incur imprisonment if they catch you trying to take one out of Japan. As of replicas, most are fakes, you shouldn''t buy replicas unless they come from one of the officially licensed japanese families in Japan(but then again you can''t have it leave the country). You can find companies which sell live blade katanas which are made outside of Japan and the swords are meant for martial arts practice; most precisely Tameshigiri which is often taught by kendo and iaido instructors. The swords are very reliable and are made in modern factories which although might seem awkward, but making swords is much easier in our times that it was in the past and the metals we use these days are much better than in the past aswell, so I wouldn''t worry about getting a replica.', ''),

I mean, beyond pest control and possibly animals like foxes and coyotes, there''s not much a regular airgun can do, at least [i]humanely[/i]. A PCP big-bore airgun, such as [url=http://www.pyramydair.com/cgi-bin/show.pl?cmd_rifles=show_guns_manufacturer&Manufacturer=Sam%20Yang]these[/url], is surely more powerful than any .22 springer. \n\nIf you limit yourself to high power .22 spring guns, the RWS Diana 350 Magnum (break-barrel) and 460 Magnum (under-lever) are quite powerful. Specs of the Walther Talon Magnum and Falcon are also pretty impressive. When you move into the world of PCPs, a whole host of different options is available, each different from the last...\n\nThat said...\n\nForgive me, but I still have trouble understanding how exactly the knowledge of the BEST airgun [i](I highly doubt the existence of one, please correct me if I am mistaken)[/i] will aid us...\n\nIf you are looking for an airgun, lets get back down to Earth, and take a look at [i]reasonable[/i] options...', ''),

(122007, ' article from the net\n\n"\n\nI have conducted my own drop tests using my Mak 9 mm hi-cap model manufactured by Imez and imported by KBI. Although not scientifically done, I am satisfied that my firearm, at least, won''t discharge by dropping.\n\nI removed the ball from a 9mm Mak round manufactured by Cor-Bon, emptied the propellant, but retained the primer. I then cleaned the bolt repeatedly with solvent until the firing pin would move back and forth easily. A drop of oil was added and movement was again affirmed. The floor was a pine board to protect the firearm as well as the real floor, and the firearm was dropped 200 times, per the CA test. The drop height varied from table top to ten feet. The primer round was in the chamber and the safety was engaged. Twenty-three of the drops resulted in the firearm landing slightly askew as its center of gravity made muzzle drops from more that three feet difficult. Nevertheless, of the 177 successful drops not one resulted in so much as a mark on the primer cap. This is probably due to the low velocity of the drop at such minor heights, but I suspect that the minuscule mass of the firing pin and the fact that it can only travel about three millimeters at best precludes sufficient energy transfer to impact the primer.\n\nAnyway, I feel confident that my gun, at least, is safe for carry. I have talked to a number of Mak owners since my first email, and no one has heard of such a faulty discharge.\n\nA.B. - Bellevue, WA\n\n"\n\nand 1 more\n\n\n"\n\nThe Makarov has a free-floating firing pin. It is heavy enough to make a slight dent in the primer of a chambered round if the gun is dropped on the tip of the barrel and when the slide goes into battery and chambers a round. The impact is not strong enough to actually fire a round but is enough to make the gun illegal in California.\n\nThe safety lever is located on the left side of the slide and serves as a decocker. When in the safe position a protrusion of the safety lever moves in front of the firing pin, preventing the gun from firing even if it is dropped on the hammer.\n\n"', ''),

Most BB guns are smoothbore, however, the 880 has a rifled barrel.\n[img]http://i710.photobucket.com/albums/ww103/KageFoxOS/Daisy%20Powerline%20880/DaisyP880-08154.jpg[/img]\n\nThe bolt pulled back, action open, gun cocked:\n[img]http://i710.photobucket.com/albums/ww103/KageFoxOS/Daisy%20Powerline%20880/DaisyP880-08158.jpg[/img]\n\nThe front part of the bolt which is supposed to seat the pellet:\n[img]http://i710.photobucket.com/albums/ww103/KageFoxOS/Daisy%20Powerline%20880/DaisyP880-08167.jpg[/img]\n\nThe pellet pushing tool I fashioned out of a very thin piece of metal rod:\n[img]http://i710.photobucket.com/albums/ww103/KageFoxOS/Daisy%20Powerline%20880/DaisyP880-08124.jpg[/img]\n\nThe loading tool in action:\n[img]http://i710.photobucket.com/albums/ww103/KageFoxOS/Daisy%20Powerline%20880/DaisyP880-08171.jpg[/img]\n\nWhen not required, the loading tool can reside here.

The pistol is based on significantly modified Makarov PM pistol, and features an unique integral two-part silencer. The rear part of the silencer is fixed around the barrel, which is drilled to decrease the muzzle velocity below the speed of sound. The front part of the silencer is quickly detachable, so pistol can be broken down into two parts for more convenient carry. Unlike many other integrally silenced pistols the PB can be safely fired with the front part of the silencer removed, but this will greatly increase the sound signature. Still, it is an useful emergency feature. Because the front part of the barrel is enclosed into the silencer, the slide is made very short and cannot contain the return spring. Instead, the return spring is located in the grip, under the right panel, and linked to the slide via the rocking lever. The double-action firing unit with external hammer and slide-mounted safety/decocker, as well as the magazine, are borrowed from Makarov PM pistol with no modification. PB has fixed sights. For carry, it is issued with a special holster, which has compartments for the gun and the detached front part of the silencer. \n\n"', ''),

When manufacturing anything, not every part comes out perfect. Say the military contract specifies everything must be within 0.001" of original design dimensions. If out of every 200 barrels, or every 350 firing pins made, one comes out that''s 0.0015" out of spec, that piece has to be rejected.  But, if the order does not have that requirement, or specifies that parts within 0.002" will be acceptable, it makes it cheaper and easier for the manufacturer.', ''),

(122181, ' Hi guys, lets have something different. \n\nWe have a handgun accuracy test where, using a standard procedure, I test the accuracy potential of a handgun. The ammo and firing position / stance of the firer remains constant in all the tests. \n\nWe all understand that other than the gun, quality of ammo also has a profound effect on the accuracy of a handgun. So this comes out to be the second factor that would have an effect on the overall accuracy level achieved by a shooter. \n\nThird factor is the shooter himself. And this is the most important factor in my view. If the shooter is not good, the accuracy level would never be satisfactory, even if he is firing hand loads with a Sig P226 X6. :)\n\nNow getting back to the subject. Today I conducted ammo test of 8 different brands of 9x19 Parabellum and 2 different brands of 9x18 Makarov. As I mentioned earlier, the other two factors were constant during these tests, ie, same shooter with same stance / firing technique and same gun. \n\n[b]Basic Parameters[/b] They remained constant during all tests. \n\n[b]Handgun:.............................. CZ999 Scorpion[/b] for 9x19 ammo\n                   ...............................[b]Russian Makarov[/b] for 9x18 Makarov ammo\n[b]Distance:...............................20 M[/b]\nTechnique:.............................Deliberate fire with both hands, shooting sitting on a chair with his elbows resting on a table.

[b]Wolf (Green casing)....................... 1.4 inches[/b]. \nThis is remarkable accuracy. You cant get it far better than this in a factory loaded ammo. This is the performance of a hand loaded ammo.\n\n2.  [b]POF1Z (1975 lot)[/b]....................... [b]3.2 inches[/b]. \nThis is again very accurate. Except one bullet inside the bull (which is shooter''s error, remember I am aiming at the base of the box), other four bullets are withing 1.5 inches. It''s a 35 years old ammo and still shooting that accurately. Again, you cant get it far better than this in a factory loaded ammo. \n\n3.  [b]Wolf (Steel gray casing)....................... 3.5 inches[/b].  This is good accuracy. \n\n4.  [b]POF 2Z (2000 lot)....................... 4.1 inches[/b]. \nI seem to have shifted the aim during this string. Three bullets are within 1.1 inch in the bull and the other two are quite far off, but close to each other withing 1 inch. This is quite accurate ammo, though the result does not appear to be that good. I am sure with better concentration, I would fire much better with this ammo. \n\n5.  [b]Armscor JHP ....................... 5.6 inches[/b]. \n1 bullet at the bottom is shooters error. The group of remainig 4 bullets is 3.9 inches which is just satisfactory. Not really a very accurate ammo. \n\n6.  [b]POF 2Z (1990 lot) ....................... 4.5 inches[/b]. \nThis is a mediocre performance. Bullets sprayed all over the place. \n\n7.  [b]Chinese (Blue Box)[/b]....................... [b]4.8 inches[/b]. \nJust an average accuracy. \n\n8.  [b]Chinese (Red Box)....................... 5.3 inches[/b]. \nAgain, just an average accuracy. \n\n\n[b]9x18 Makarov results[/b]\n\n1.  [b]Federal American Eagle....................... 3.2 inches[/b]. \nThis is very good accuracy. 4 bullets are making a group of 1.5 inches from 20 M. Isn''t this a remarkable accuracy?? 1 bullet hitting down is probably  shooter''s fault. Even if that bullet which clearly is out of the pattern is counted, 3.2 inches from  group from 20 M is not bad at all. \n\n2.  [b]Russian....................... 2.8 inches[/b]. \nThis is again very accurate. \n\nFew days  back I fired  Armscor FMJ ammo and wasn’t impressed with the accuracy of that ammo at all. I could not take the pics but it was quite an ordinary performance (of the level of Chinese ammo). \n\nSo the conclusion so far; the cheapest of all the branded ammo is the best as well (in accuracy)\n\nI will add results of a few more ammos as well in few days. Please give five to seven bullets of different ammos to SA sahib and he will bring those to me on 30th Jun :D  \n\nregards', ''),

You see this is the disadvantage of copy and paste :lol: Post edited. \n\nAs for the group measurements, wherever I have given two measurements, the bigger one is the actual group of five bullets. However, in certain cases I felt that 4 bullets hit very close but the fifth one goes astray. More chances are that this is shooter''s fault and with better concentration, fifth bullets would have also adopted the same pattern as the other four bullets. That is why I have mentioned both the measurements. If four bullets are hitting close enough, I know its an accurate ammo and should therefore be graded as such. \n\nHow to measure a group............ measure the distance between the center of the holes formed by two farthest bullets in the group. Or measure the distance from the outer corners of two holes formed by two farthest bullets and minus the caliber Or measure the distance from the inner corners of two holes formed by two farthest bullets in a group and plus the caliber. \n\neg, \n\nMeasurement taken from center of holes formed by two farthest bullets in a group............ 109 mm\nGroup Size............................................................................................................................. 109 mm or 4.25 inches\n\nMeasurement taken from inner corners of holes formed by two farthest bullets in a group............ 100 mm\nPlus the Caliber................................................................................................................................. 100 + 9 mm\nGroup Size............................................................................................................................. 109 mm or 4.25 inches\n\n\nMeasurement taken from outer corners of holes formed by two farthest bullets in a group............ 118 mm\nMinus the Caliber................................................................................................................................. 118 - 9 mm\nGroup Size............................................................................................................................. 109 mm or 4.25 inches\n\nHope I have not confused the things further. \n\n\nMR brother, yes.

(122296, ' This particular Mak is 6PB-Osa.  \n\nThe PB is a heavily-modified PM Makarov originally produced in 1967 for certain Spetsnaz units. The PB is equipped with an integral two-part suppressor which is very effective for noise suppression. The PB is designed to be used with standard Makarov ammunition, with the suppressor slowing the round to subsonic velocities. The front part of the suppressed barrel can be removed to fit into its special holster or a pocket; the PB can even be fired without the front of its suppressor, though noise suppression is almost nil without it. (The front part of the suppressor weighs 0.16 kg.) The slide had to be considerably shortened to accommodate the suppressor, and as a result, the recoil spring was relocated to the right side under a panel. The recoil spring is then connected to the slide by a long, swinging arm. The PB is believed to still be in production; though production did stop in mid-1980s, it is believed to have resumed in about 2000.', ''),

(122374, ' [quote=psychiatrist-1]Why General Custer was beaten?\nBecause he was an imbecile.\nGeneral  George Armstrong Custer was promoted from Colonel to Lt. General during the Native Americans ( so called Red Indians) wars in 1874. He had been a veteran of war between the states a bloodiest civil war which lasted from 1861-1864. He was Union soldier called Yankee ( Southern were called rebels or rebels). More US soldiers were killed in the civil wars than all the wars that USA had ever been involved until to this day. \n	Custer was not a brilliant commander and but dare devil who won fame during the civil war. However, he became an arrogant, self serving idiot who wanted to be the president of the USA. So, despised all the signs for his defeat at the hand of Indian coalition, Custer attacked coalition of  2 dozens tribes which included, all the Dakotas (Sioux Lakhota  nation and Chyenne). He was supposed to wait until General Crook army had been arrived but Custer wanted the glory for himself alone and attacked the Indians.\n	These Indians were divided into many tribes. It was the first time that American Indians united together against the “pale face” under the leadership of Chief Crazy Horse and the medicine man Sitting Bull. The numbers of Indians were 2000. In 1876 Custer’s 7th cavalry was wiped out by the Indians at a place called Little Big Horn. Custer had only 700 men in his regiment.  \nin Montana territory. It was not the single shot Carbine only but both side used Winchester 66-73 repeating rifle. Indian bought this forbidden weapons from the white smugglers for 5X its price. Indians were not allowed to have rifles. Holly Wood fanaticized Custer and made him a hero but recent research showed that it was the opposite what public was made to believe.\n            If you ever visit the Little Big Horn battle field, you will see a well kept cemetry with a monument in the memory of 7th Cavlary but sadly, there is nothing about Indians who died in that war. However, in 1986, USA governmnet established fund to carve the face of great Indian warrior Chief Crazy Horse along the four president on mount Rushmore, South Dakota.

(159678, 'Handgun Accuracy Thread; Handgun Accuracy; [B]INTRODUCTION[/B]\n\nWhile going through posts about different handgun, I always thought that in many cases, our opinions are biased about the handguns that we own or we have used. There is nothing wrong about it; it is but natural. However, at times the whole exercise of knowing about a weapon goes for a fix when someone doesn''t like a comment or view on one of his favourite handgun. This ignites a futile discussion and the [B]biggest sufferers are less experienced members who log on to this site for knowing authentic facts about the handguns they want to buy or use[/B]. The main reason for this is that most of us do not follow an objective method of reviewing a handgun and do not quantify our opinion. Comparative data is mostly not available and in the absence of objective facts and comparative data, the review mostly takes the shape of a personal opinion.  \n\nNow how to judge a weapon objectively. I have always believed that the final test of a weapon is its firing accuracy and reliability. If a weapon cant put the bullets at intended place and is prone to stoppages or is not rugged enough to bear the field conditions, its no good a weapon no matter what the brand or price. I AM SURE ALL WOULD APPRECIATE THAT ONE SHOULD NEVER COMPROMISE ON RELIABILITY. ON ACCURACY, ONE SHOULD AGAIN NEVER COMPROMISE UNLESS IT IS INTENDED TO KEEP A CONCEAL CARRY GUN. Even while buying a CC gun, one should keep in mind that it must meet 100% reliability and bare minimum accuracy requirements. Hence this thread. \n\nIn this thread, I would request everyone to post firing results of different handguns that we own or use. However, unless there are standard parameters to quantify the results, there is no use of such an exercise. I would therefore suggest a standard method which I have been following myself to check the accuracy of various handguns. [B]This, by no means is a comprehensive method but a quick and economical one.[/B]. Any suggestions to improve this method (while still keeping it economical) would be most welcome. MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS IS THE TEST OF THE GUN AND NOT OF THE FIRER. \n\n[B]THE METHOD[/B]:\n\n1.  In order to minimise firer''s error, [B]handgun should preferably be fired from a bench.[/B] If a proper firing bench is not available, firer may rest his elbows on a table while himself sitting on a chair. \n\n2.  [B]A standard target[/B] with 1 inch radius bull (10 points) 2 inch radius 9 ring, 3 inch radius 8 ring, 4 inch radius 7 ring and so on, be used for firing. \n\n3.  One round of test fire should consist of [B]15 bullets, 5 fired from 10 M, another 5 from 20 M and another five from 30 M.[/B] The procedure should preferably be repeated twice, ie, total of 30 bullets. Two warmer rounds should be fired from the gun before starting test fire. This will make a total of 32 bullets for one handgun. \n\n4.  [B]Ammo should not be changed[/B] during the test. Moreover, magazine should be filled to max capacity, in order to check the performance of magazine and chances of failure to feed. \n\n5.  [B]Aiming point should be the center of the bull and must not be changed[/B] throughout the test even if a firer can clearly note bias of bullets on a particular side. ie, no adjustments should be done throughout the test. If guns has adjustable sights, they should be zeroed before the test but during the test, sights should not be adjusted. \n\n6.  Photos be taken after each test. \n\n7.  As the number of bullets fired in one go is 15, the test will have 150 points. Add 150 points of the second test and take and average / percentage. I suggest following grading;\n\n    -  [B]Exceptionally Accurate....................95% and above \n     -  Extremely Accurate........................90% - 94.9% \n     -  Very Accurate.................................85% to 89.9% \n     -  Accurate.........................................80% to 84.9% \n     -  Fairly Accurate................................75% to 79.9% \n     -  Moderately Accurate........................ 70% to 74.9%\n     -  Average..........................................60% to 69.9% \n     -  Just acceptable...............................50% to 59.9% \n     -  Inaccurate, should preferably not be bought.......45% to 49.9% \n     -  Junk, Dont buy it.............................44.9% and below[/B]\n\nI always thought that the scoring system of this accuracy test should not be just based on points scored on precision shooting target. The groups formed by the pistol should also be taken into account and should be added to overall score. I have therefore tried to give values to groups formed from 10, 20 and 30 M tests. I am going to amend all the previous results and add the points scored through the groups. It was pointed out by few senior members as well that group formed by a particular handgun should also have some waitage. For standardisation sake, I will be using following values:\n\n[U][B]Group from 10 M[/B][/U]\n-  1.5 inches or less............50 points\n-  1.6 to 2 inches...............45 \n-  2.1 to 2.5 inches............40\n-  2.6 to 3 inches..............35\n-  3.1 to 3.5 inches............30\n-  3.6 to 4 inches...............25\n-  4.1 to 4.5 inches............20\n-  4.6 to 5 inches...............15\n-  5.1 to 5.5 inches............10\n-  5.6 to 6 inces................5\n-  Over 6 inches................0\n\n[U][B]Group from 20 M[/B][/U]\n-  2 inches or less............50 points\n-  2.1 to 3 inches.............45 \n-  3.1 to 4 inches.............40\n-  4.1 to 5 inches.............35\n-  5.1 to 6 inches.............30\n-  6.1 to 7 inches.............25\n-  7.1 to 8 inches.............20\n-  8.1 to 9 inches.............15\n-  9.1 to 10 inches...........10\n-  10.1 to 11 inces............5\n-  Over 11 inches..............0\n\n[U][B]Group from 30 M[/B][/U]\n-  3 inches or less............50 points\n-  3.1 to 4 inches.............45 \n-  4.1 to 5 inches.............40\n-  5.1 to 6 inches.............35\n-  6.1 to 7 inches.............30\n-  7.1 to 8 inches.............25\n-  8.1 to 9 inches.............20\n-  9.1 to 10 inches...........15\n-  10.1 to 11 inches..........10\n-  11.1 to 12 inces............5\n-  Over 12 inches..............0\n\n8.  [B]MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THIS IS THE TEST OF THE GUN AND NOT OF THE FIRER.[/B] So please don''t try to improve the result by making adjustmet. Just fire the gun as it is, adhering to standard parameters mentioned above. \n\n9.  Post the pics in the thread and wait for the comments :D\n\nI will start the thread by posting the test fire results of a few handguns. I am sure others would also add their pics following the standard procedure. After some time, we will have a good number of pics concerning different guns and a new user will be able to compare the results and at least have some objective input about one of the very important aspects of any handgun. \n\nThanks and regards\n\n=============================================================================================\n=============================================================================================\n\n[quote=Gilani][B][U]S U M M A R Y   OF   R E S U L T S   S O   F A R  : [COLOR=red]Updated on Sep 6th, 2010[/COLOR][/U][/B]\n\nI was just wondering that the size of this thread has gone quite enormous and it may be difficult for the members to go through all the pages and see the results of all handguns, when they want to draw a comparison. I have therefore summarized the performance of all handguns tested so far in this post. I have also categorized them as per their size / use. The purpose of doing this is that though all handguns are being tested using the same procedure, their accuracy results do not carry equal values in my view. For example, a score of 65% by a sub-compact gun may be far better than a score of 70% by a large frame gun. Mathematical values are good as they describe the results in tangible form but in the end, members should carry out their own analysis keeping in mind their own peculiar requirements for a handgun. Hope it helps  :) \n\n    \n[B][U][I][COLOR=Red]LARGE FRAME HANDGUNS[/COLOR][/I][/U][/B]\n\n    1.

However, seeing its final form now, I realise that it has somewhat become a result card kind of thing which speaks good of certain handgun guns and also bad of certain handguns. Please keep in mind following aspects while going through this summary...................\n\n1.  This by no means is a final result of some kind of ACCURACY COMPETITION held between these guns. [B]Neither these tests are the perfect / most scientific tests for judging the accuracy nor this should be taken as the final performance of a particular brand of handgun.[/B] \n\n2.  I realise that the results of those handguns which I have been firing more over the years or I own are better than few other guns. This is natural. So please don''t get carried away too much with the mathematics. If Handgun A is scoring 77.11 and handgun B is scoring 74.34 than it does not necessarily mean that handgun A is better. Perhaps both are of same category . If PT99 and CZ999 are on top of the list than it does not mean that these are two most accurate pistols around and are better than say Glock 17 or few other because these have scored better percentage.  However, it does mean that both of them are accurate handguns and can be trusted for accuracy :) \n\n3.  Few handguns have performed really bad. This again does not mean that all specimens of this brand would perform the same way. May be the one I tested was a lemon or its sights were way out. [B]But one thing is for sure; there is some serious problem somewhere.[/B] So please keep that handgun on your watch list and check it thoroughly before making a decision to buy it. \n\n4.  [B]Please do also understand my limitations as a human being.[/B] I will never be able to give a standard performance every time because it is humanly not possible; only machines can do it. Accordingly, the results may slightly vary for different handguns but not too much. \n\n5.  [B]This, by no means is a marketing campaign for a few handguns and a dumping campaign for the others.[/B] You may consult this as a reference but finally make your own decision while you are buying a handgun, keeping in mind your requirements and pocket. \n\n6.  Therefore, [B]these tests are not a most scientifically conducted final verdict on a particular handgun, however, they do provide a tangible basis for judging one of the most important characteristic of any handgun; its accuracy.[/B]  \n\n\n\nThanks and regards :)[/quote]\n\n=============================================================================================\n=============================================================================================\n\n[URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?3140-Handgun-Accuracy-Thread"][IMG]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5840.jpg[/IMG]\n[/URL]', 'Handgun Accuracy'),

Basically the new CZ TT and its 9mm version are from Tangfolio but with a CZ stamp on it. I''ve also heard that CZ is procuring Tangfolio weapons because they have a much better potential of selling under the CZ markings than Tangfolio''s ((Philippines)).\n\nThe CZ-TT is available in Lahore at PARA and Majeed Sons.

Secondly if you cant do that, then do the following,\ntake vegetables like potatoes, spinach (palak), carrots and boil them, for about an hour, then throw out the vegetables and in that stock, boil rice, and mince meat togather. rice should be boiled till they become soggy (pich pichaye). mix them well with your hands, add a couple of drops of olive oil, chop one little peice of garlic very finely, mix it in, and then give it to him/her. for Breakfast give him one hard boiled egg, one or two toasts of bread and milk, blend all this togather and give it to him. for lunch just give him a bowl of milk. for better results add a two or three teaspoons of baby formula to his lunch time milk bowl. hope that helps. i could recommend a few brands of dog food also, but somehow our climate does not favour dog food in puppies. they develop skin problems from that. and please, this diet tip is only for puppies.', ''),

CERN is home to the world’s highest energy particle accelerator and has been the subject of considerable media attention as it collides particles travelling at very nearly the speed of light to recreate the very early moments of the Big Bang. Imminent scientific discoveries are expected and with them, a significant development in our understanding of the laws of nature.\n\nPerhaps the last major breakthrough in the world of particle physics came in the 1960s when Dr Abdus Salam, a Pakistani physicist, proposed a mathematical model that unified two of the four fundamental forces in nature and described them as different aspects of a single force. The unification of two forces into a single theory, known as the electroweak theory, was a major stepping stone and earned Dr Abdus Salam, Sheldon Lee Glashow and Steven Weinberg the Nobel Prize in 1979.\n\nDecades later, when studying particle physics at Oxford University, I came across Dr Salam’s name for the first time. I may not have fully appreciated the consequences of the theory he proposed and the reason why he was awarded the Nobel Prize, but I knew it was important and it gave me immense pride. I wanted to tell everyone and anyone that the Salam in the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam Theory was Pakistani. That Pakistan, a third-world country was capable of producing great scientists and contributing to the advancement of science on an international level. I knew this was a rare and special moment. It isn’t often that Pakistanis are awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nIt was not until I started my PhD that I realised the significance of Dr Salam’s contribution. Since the theoretical model he postulated was central to my research, almost an entire chapter of my thesis is dedicated to it. Dr Salam’s electroweak theory predicted the existence of a set of particles called the W and Z bosons (subatomic particles). Indeed, the subsequent discovery of these particles in 1982 was a great triumph for the theory! I earned my PhD thesis by measuring with utmost precision the properties of the W bosons predicted by Dr Salam’s theory. In the course of communicating my research to people, it was impossible to omit his name. For a country that doesn’t have a long list of notable figures to celebrate, I found it surprising that Dr Salam was not a household name. For a man who put Pakistan on the world map and etched his country’s name into scientific history, he was astonishingly downplayed.\n\nHailing from a very mediocre background in a village near Jhang, Salam represented the average Pakistani. He attended an ordinary Urdu medium school but his intellectual ability was not ordinary. He completed his matriculation exam at the age of fourteen and went on to win a scholarship to study mathematics and physics at Cambridge University, a course he completed in just a year with a first class degree. Dr Salam returned to Pakistan in 1951 and became head of the mathematics department at the Punjab University. However, when his intention of setting up a research institute to encourage the pursuit of knowledge in his country did not look feasible, he returned to England. He channeled his disappointment in not being able to pursue his research career in Pakistan by setting up an International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. The aim was to provide deserving young physicists from all over the world, in particular the developing nations, with an international scientific platform to meet and interact with one another and prevent them from being professionally isolated in their respective countries. Dr Salam wanted young scientists from developing countries to have opportunities to contribute to the forefront of research without becoming part of the brain drain. His devotion and commitment to the advancement of science in his homeland was exemplary, yet puzzling, given the treatment he received in his later years.\n\nThe growing religious intolerance in the country has served to shed light on a number of issues, particularly our ability as a country to shoot ourselves in the foot time and time again. However, no amount of name-calling or religious blacklisting can take away from the genius that was Dr Salam. He is regarded the world over as an outstanding physicist who played an instrumental role in furthering our understanding of the most fundamental area of science. Our inability to capitalise on his success or indeed give him his due regard represents a dismal failure. Had Dr Salam been born in another country, things may have been different.\n\nAs a young particle physicist or indeed as a scientist, I am all too conscious of the complete dearth of eminent role models to have emerged from Pakistan or the Muslim world at large and as such, I for one will wholeheartedly endorse the recognition and status bestowed on Dr Abdus Salam by the rest of the world; an honour he rightfully deserved, especially in the country to which he showed such zealous commitmen', ''),

The pistol entered production at the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant in 1973.\n\nThe PSM is a blowback-operated handgun with a double action trigger and slide mounted manual safety without a slide stop. The grip panels are made from thin aluminum and new model with hard plastic. The weapon is made from steel.\n\nThe PSM was designed around the newly developed 5.45x18mm cartridge, which was developed for the weapon by Precision Mechanical Engineering Central Research Institute. The cartridge is capable of penetrating 55 layers of kevlar at realistic engagement distances.[citation needed] This cartridge has a bottlenecked case and a spitzer-pointed jacketed bullet, providing performance superior to the .22 LR and .25 ACP (6.35x16mmSR Browning) rounds.\n\nThe pistol was primarily intended for army high command staff. However, owing to its insignificant dimensions, especially small thickness (21 mm across the safety catch), it soon became popular with security (KGB) and law enforcement (militsiya) personnel. The PSM was also appreciated by higher echelon Communist Party functionaries.[citation needed]\n\nAn export model designated the IZh-75 was produced in .25 ACP.[/quote]\n\nAbout the cartridge\n\n[quote]5.45x18mm MPTs (7N7) is a Russian pistol cartridge.[1]  It is chambered in the PSM pistol and OTs-23 DROTIK machine pistol.\n\nIt was designed in the Soviet Union in the early 1970s by Antonina D. Denisova at the Precision Mechanical Engineering Central Research Institute (TsNIITochmash). The development was done in concert with that of the PSM.\n\nThe cartridge design of the 5.45x18mm is essentially a 9x18mm Makarov pistol cartridge bottlenecked down to take a smaller spitzer-pointed jacketed high velocity bullet. In terms of power, the bullet energy is stated to be up to 1.5 times that of the .25 ACP in a similar sized cartridge. More importantly, it is stated to be capable of penetrating 30-45 layers of Kevlar soft body armor followed by 10 to 15mm of solid pinewood at "realistic engagement distances".[/quote]', ''),

(122838, ' Where is DSA arm company  located in Pakistan?\n       Well, whether the foreign made shot gun is safe, better in quality is an opinion. It actually depends on what and how much you want to spend. I bought a savage bolt action shot gun 18 years back for  $45. It performed like $45 too. It kicked like a mule, could n’t eject the spent shell and it hit the target only when it was in good mood. I declared it imbecile, unfit for use. So, I gave it away to my neighbor’s son and he sawed of the barrel to the legal length of 18 inches for home defense. Only used in emergency if the base ball bat was not handy. \n	I have a few other shot guns such as O/U Browning Clitori. I have n’t the foggiest how many shells I have gone through with this. It was expensive $ 700 but after 20 years, it still the gem in my collections with one problem, in extreme cold it did jam. Then I have Browning AK 1200, semi auto made in Belgium assembled in Portugal. Quite expensive, but not as good as citori. Already, stock has developed a crack and the main holding screw gotten loose.\n	I have heard a lot about DSA manufacturer and I wonder why DSA can not come up with same quality as another foreign made guns? If Pakistan is able to manufacture Nuclear bomb which is the most ultimate difficult weapon to produce, then Pakistan should have no problem to come up with a good quality shot gun. It is not the lack of skills or ingenuity. Pakistan is very capable.', ''),

Otherwise they used to manufacture S/S and single-shot shotguns for both the budget-user and the connoisseur.

Remember using the rounds with the ability of steel penetration is not allowed in any country there are no such laws in our country about ammunition in our country but in US and in Russia there are strict laws for using steel penetrating rounds and yes if you all think that MP 446 and MP 443 have no difference in barrels then why MP 443 is called a pure military version and MP 446 a pure civilian version ? brothers the barrel of MP 446 is not as good as it is in MP 443  now lets come to the point that MP 446 viking can fire AP rounds or not I strongly recommend NO but its not like if you try to fire such round if you FIND them its gonna destroy the gun in seconds maybe it won''t but surely its gonna work like a catalyst in reducing the barrel life if the barrel life of Grach is 50,000 rounds and MP 446 50,000 too you can fire 50,000 7N21/7N31 rounds from your MP 443 but you cant fire more then 5,000 rounds from your MP 446 Viking because Viking is not meant to fire hot rounds only Grach can handle these hot rounds , brothers there is a big difference between these two models which makes these pistol one for pure military use and other for pure civilian use.', ''),

That''s because many buy it for the cool factor after seeing it in the movie "Max Payne." Of course this isn''t the first time this has happened: "Dirty Harry" Callahan helped popularize the Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver and the powerful .44 Magnum cartridge. However that combination did indeed perform impressively albeit at a substantial weight and size (which was very common in the 1970s). The Taurus Judge in some models has some of the same issues. The Model 4510TKR-3SSMAG weighs a stout 37 ounces. This bobbed hammer Ultra-Lite version (shown) is a more reasonable 25 ounces and others like it list in the Taurus catalog for 23 oz. Don''t expect perfection in the design though. Chambered for both .45 Colt and the .410 shotshell, the Judge is a compromise of design in order to accommodate these different loads. The long cylinder is necessary to fit the .410 but sacrifices .45 Colt accuracy in doing so (also the shallow rifling needed to accommodate the shotshell). Overall length of the .410 shell is around 2.5", the .45 colt around 1.6". This length difference necessitates a long "jump" into the rifling and degrades accuracy. Close range accuracy of the pistol round is adequate but there are reports that it degrades quickly past 15 feet. If you can connect, the venerable .45 Colt with 185 gr JHP will do damage as perhaps will a .410 shotshell packing three 000 pellets. Also consider its very limited firepower of just five rounds and the fact that the ammo will be bulky and HEAVY (which negates its backpacking use). For home defense it could serve adequately with alternate loadings of shotshell and centerfire ammunition. But other downsides include inability to regulate the fixed sights (rear sight groove milled in frame), bulkiness in carry, limited holster options, substantial blast and recoil, high cost, and difficulty in concealment. The Taurus Judge then remains a close range weapon only and there are many smarter options that will expand your defensive options. But in the role of snake killer, I think the Taurus would excel providing a close range shotgun capability in pistol form. . /////////////Nutnfancy Likeability Scale: 3 of 10[/quote]', ''),

(122987, ' [b]So far, we have opinions but no authentic data. [/b] We need to have a confirmed and authentic source to be sure about the things. (opinions on different gun forums and handgun reviews by individuals are not a confirmed source, in my view). What Crazy Shooter is saying may be true and may not be true. [b]I have not been able to find any authentic data on chamber pressure limits of Viking and Grach.[/b] One thing I can say for sure; the chamber and barrel of Viking is far heavily constructed than normal handguns. I have compared it with the barrels of about 20 handguns and found it more robustly constructed. However, this is just a guess and does not have a scientific backing. \n\nFew words about the term [b]"hot loads".[/b] What exactly do we mean by this? How many lbs psi are we talking about? In general terms, anything above the normal 9x19 Parabellum round (which is up to 35000 lb psi) is referred to as a hot load. So it includes +P ammos, it includes +P+ ammos which go up to 39000 lb psi and it also includes 7N21 and 7N31 which go much over 39000 lb psi. 7N31, as per my knowledge, is the hottest 9x19 parabellum round. [b]In any case, sale of 7N21 and 7N31 for civilian use is strictly forbidden in Russia. So it is basically the ammo on which there are restrictions. If there are any restrictions on selling MP443 Grach to the civilians as well than I am not aware of it.[/b] Baikal website however mentions Grach as one of the pistols available for sale. But we need some confirmed information on this which we can only get from IZH Baikal. \n\nI am sure all Viking owners would be knowing that Viking comes in three basic models. One is the simple MP446 which has a polymer frame and 112.8 mm barrel, second is the MP446 C which has a polymer frame but 120 mm barrels with option of adjustable sights. Third is the steel frame model of MP446 Viking which has a 112.8 mm barrel. Therefore, steel frame does not mean that it has to be a Grach only. Vikings with steel frame are also available but I am not sure about their availability in Pakistan.  :)', ''),

It means something else when it comes from a senior like you sir :)\n\nI 100% agree with you that for a newbie like me, the handgun, ammo, even distance perhaps for some of the early shots should be the same. All this so you can nail down your errors first. Unfortunately, as desperate as I am for one, I don''t own a handgun. No MOI, and no foreseeable signs of it :( So I was shooting other brothers'' guns at the range. I''ve done some dry fire practice with a Cougar so the results were better on that. I''m much more familiar with its grip and trigger behavior. I shot another string with the Cougar (not photographed unfortunately) and got 2 out of 3 headshots (where headshots were intended) one kinda high one kinda low, and one flier. Out of the remaining two center of mass intended shots, one was in the low left 8 ring, abt 8 o''clock and the other a near 12 o''clock high 8. With humility, I''ll agree with you that inshallah on successive practice sessions I could get better fairly fast. Fairly confident :)\n\nSir, Sonnenkind is German for ''Child of the sun''. It is pronounced zonun-kind where the ''i'' sounds like in ''tin'' or ''bin'' as opposed to in ''fine''.. ie kind as in [b]kind[/b]ergarten (which is German for children''s garden).

As regards your comment that very few people buy Viking and few dealers own it, I am afraid that''s grossly incorrect. I know many PG members who own Viking. Many of my friends who are not a PG member also own it. In fact, Viking is quite a common gun and as Aquarius brother mentioned, it is one of the most popular guns around. Most good quality dealers have Viking and there are few who don''t have it. I cant say about Karachi but this certainly is the case in Lahore. \n\nAs for the finish, Viking has Phosphorised finish. Liking or not liking it is a personal matter. But there is just no doubt about it that this finish is longer lasting than the normal blue finish. \n\nI my personal view, Viking has a grandeur of its own :)\n\nI have never fired a Zagana Sport so wont be able to comment on it :)', ''),

I am not talking about some black market but its not available in any russian gun market neither its for export just because Grach is meant to fire 7N21 and 7N31 rounds this information was on worldguns.ru but no longer there I have red this somewhere else too that the major difference between a viking and grach is the quality of barrel I don''t remember the link now I''ll let you guys know as soon as I get it again I am trying but I am sure there is a difference between these two pistol but dont think I am saying anything about the performance of viking because I have already said Viking is one of the most finest gun in its price range and for me in ranking it stands 2nd after Berreta 92FS Inox', ''),

In my view, complete details are not available at the moment (and if they are available than I am not aware of it). :)\n\nAs regards the question that why Russians are not exporting Grach, well, as per Russian policy, the official sidearm of the armed forces is not allowed to be sold in the civilian market in the same shape as it is issued to Army. Same was the case with Makarov till 1991 or so. What they do is that they make the same pistol with a different name and markings and sell it in the market. One could buy a Makarov in 60s and 70s also but not the one which was issued to Russian Army. They were the same Makarov, manufactured by same companies but with slightly different markings etc. After its retirement as official sidearm, Makarov was being sold all over the place as Russian Military Surplus. \n\nProbably same is the case with Grach. They can''t sell it in the market with the same name and hence Viking. What I am saying is not with the purpose of  proving that Viking can fire 7N21 or 7N31. I have already mentioned that I don''t have authentic information about it. It may be or may not be. What I am trying to say is that other than its ability to fire the high velocity ammos, there are other reason also due to which a Grach can not be sold to civilian market (though it can be exported to other armies ). :)', ''),

The project was given the cover name Grach (''rook''), with three designs under consideration:The Grach-1 combined blowback operation with gas locking but was not considered worthy of further development.The Grach-2 was eventually selected for Russian armed forces service as the 6P35 Grach, or PYa (Pistolet Yarygin), after the head designer, Vladimir Yarygin.The Grach-3 emerged as the PMM, a modified Makarov with a large capacity magazine and firing an enhanced 9 x 18 mm round . After some public exposure the PMM appears to have been abandoned, possibly because the enhanced cartridge which required a modified chamber to retard ejection until pressure levels had dropped, could also be fired in the standard unmodified Makarov pistol.Considerable attention was paid to the exact type of ammunition the 6P35 Grach was to fire before it was decided to adopt the new 9 × 19 mm 7N21 cartridge with its enhanced armour-penetrating bullet. Although the 7N21 has dimensions almost exactly the same as those for the 9 × 19 mm round, it imparts a higher muzzle velocity. A version of the 6P35 specifically designed to fire standard loadings of 9 × 19 mm ammunition is known as the MP-446 Viking self-loading pistol; it is visually identical to the 6P35 and as of 2008, is intended for export.', ''),

(123104, ' [quote=Crazy Shooter]I am sure about it now that MP 446 is just to handle standard 9 mm bullets[/quote]\n\nOK, thanks for quoting a excerpt from Janes, which is a Western source. I was looking for something from IZH Baikal, which are the manufacturers of Grach and Viking Pistols. \n\nAs per this source, Viking is designed to fire standard 9mm loads. No further technical details are given. Standard loads of 9mm are in the range of 32k to 35k lb psi. If this is what is meant by this article (and also as per you statement above) than Viking is not capable of firing +P and +P+ ammo, what to talk about 7N21 and 7N31 which are much hotter loads. Viking may not be able to fire 7N31, I can understand that because that generates around 45K lb psi of chamber pressure. But I find it very hard to digest that Viking is not designed to fire even +P and +P+ loads, which most ordinary pistols nowadays can??? This sort of makes Viking a weak pistol, weaker than most other Chinese and Turkish pistols available in the market because all of them are designed to fire different brands of commercially available JHPs which are much hotter loads that a standard 9mm round. \n\nWe must have authentic scientific data indicating the lb psi pressure that Viking''s chamber is designed to take. Otherwise, we would just be talking in air. \n\n7N21 and 7N31 are most likely never going to be available to us, as per my estimation. So our lengthy discussions on this topic would hardly be of any use. In the absence of technical data, one can compare the breach, chamber and barrel of Viking with many other pistols and would find it much bigger and much solidly constructed. I have therefore no reasons to assume that this pistol can only fire standard 9mm. In my personal view (which is still not supported by scientific data), its should be safe to fire all types of +P and +P+ ammos commercially available in the market with Viking. It may not be able to fire 7N31 safely but that does not matter because 7N31 is perhaps never going to be available to us in the market.', ''),

(123186, ' Yarygin (MP-443 ''Grach'') 6P35 9 mm self-loading pistol (Russian Federation), Pistols\n\nDevelopment \nThe search for a replacement for the low-powered PM Makarov pistol commenced during the early 1980s, although it was not until the late 1980s that final design definitions were agreed. The project was given the cover name Grach (''rook''), with three designs under consideration:The Grach-1 combined blowback operation with gas locking but was not considered worthy of further development.The Grach-2 was eventually selected for Russian armed forces service as the 6P35 Grach, or PYa (Pistolet Yarygin), after the head designer, Vladimir Yarygin.The Grach-3 emerged as the PMM, a modified Makarov with a large capacity magazine and firing an enhanced 9 x 18 mm round . After some public exposure the PMM appears to have been abandoned, possibly because the enhanced cartridge which required a modified chamber to retard ejection until pressure levels had dropped, could also be fired in the standard unmodified Makarov pistol.Considerable attention was paid to the exact type of ammunition the 6P35 Grach was to fire before it was decided to adopt the new 9 × 19 mm 7N21 cartridge with its enhanced armour-penetrating bullet. Although the 7N21 has dimensions almost exactly the same as those for the 9 × 19 mm round, it imparts a higher muzzle velocity. A version of the 6P35 specifically designed to fire standard loadings of 9 × 19 mm ammunition is known as the MP-446 Viking self-loading pistol; it is visually identical to the 6P35 and as of 2008, is intended for export.', ''),

(123436, ' Unless the firearm is explicitly marked as being +P rated or it is clearly stated in the gun''s manual, +P ammunition should not be used. If in doubt, a check by a gunsmith or a phone call to the gun''s manufacturer will verify the safety of +P ammunition in a particular firearm. Ammunition that is loaded to +P pressures is clearly marked on the headstamp as such, for example a 9mm would be marked "9mm Luger +P".\n\nThe use of +P or +P+ ammunition does accelerate wear and reduces the service life on the component parts on any pistol.[11]\n\nIn addition to questions of safety and durability are issues of reliability and usability. Since +P cartridges may generate a significantly different quality of recoil, this can impact firearm function. For example, recoil operated firearms may fail to function if the velocity of the recoiling parts is too high; in lightweight revolvers, the cartridge case may recoil away from the bullet with sufficient force to overcome the crimp, allowing the bullet to move forward in the cylinder and causing the cylinder to bind.[12] The increased velocities and pressures of a +P loading will increase muzzle blast and recoil, and may prove difficult to handle for many shooters; these problems are exacerbated by compact, lightweight guns with short barrels.', ''),

(123440, ' [quote=Crazy Shooter]Yarygin (MP-443 ''Grach'') 6P35 9 mm self-loading pistol (Russian Federation), Pistols\n\nDevelopment \nThe search for a replacement for the low-powered PM Makarov pistol commenced during the early 1980s, although it was not until the late 1980s that final design definitions were agreed. The project was given the cover name Grach (''rook''), with three designs under consideration:The Grach-1 combined blowback operation with gas locking but was not considered worthy of further development.The Grach-2 was eventually selected for Russian armed forces service as the 6P35 Grach, or PYa (Pistolet Yarygin), after the head designer, Vladimir Yarygin.The Grach-3 emerged as the PMM, a modified Makarov with a large capacity magazine and firing an enhanced 9 x 18 mm round . After some public exposure the PMM appears to have been abandoned, possibly because the enhanced cartridge which required a modified chamber to retard ejection until pressure levels had dropped, could also be fired in the standard unmodified Makarov pistol.Considerable attention was paid to the exact type of ammunition the 6P35 Grach was to fire before it was decided to adopt the new 9 × 19 mm 7N21 cartridge with its enhanced armour-penetrating bullet. Although the 7N21 has dimensions almost exactly the same as those for the 9 × 19 mm round, it imparts a higher muzzle velocity. [b]A version of the 6P35 specifically designed to fire standard loadings of 9 × 19 mm ammunition is known as the MP-446 Viking self-loading pistol; it is visually identical to the 6P35 and as of 2008, is intended for export.[/b][/quote]\n\nLet''s face it gentlemen, the Yarygin (MP-443 ''Grach'') 6P35 9 mm self-loading pistol is not available in the market, and chances are it won''t (ever) be available.

(123529, ' @Faheem\n@Aquarius\n@Syed Adeel\nThanks a lot for your kind words, Sir :)\n\n\n@EF KAY\nI am sure definition of DA/SA triggers and DAO trigger is known to all as it was comprehensively explained by KageFox in one of the posts. Instead of going into the technicalities, I would comment on the practical implications of a DA/SA or DAO triggers for an average firer. Generally speaking, DA/SA triggers are easy to operate as they have a shorter and less heavier pull. Some people however think that its not safe to have such less trigger pull as it increases the chances of accidental fire. They prefer a trigger with longer pull which in their view avoids an accidental discharge. The practical down side of DAO trigger is that longer pull results in extra / prolonged pull on firing finger which may result in shaking / trembling of hands  and loss of concentration thus effecting accuracy. However, this can be minimised by practicing more with DAO gun. As you have seen, SA sahib has practiced well with his DAO gun hence there is no difference for him whether its a DAO gun or SA/DA gun. Regardless of all this, DAO triggers have generally been designed keeping in mind the defensive use of the gun and are not very helpful for rapid fire / double taps etc. Hope I have answered the query.', ''),

So grateful for your kind words:)\n \n\n[quote=AK47] Anyhow, thanks a lots for two more tests above, especially the PT 145''s, I had talked to Denovo Sir about this model of SA''s over the phone, yet he was more of the opinion that it was SA bro''s "own" accuracy and great practice. :) [/quote]\n\n[quote=AK47] It''s now being confirmed by you that [b]BOTH[/b], SA [b]AND[/b] the gun, are accurate! Have you any conclusions, [i]technically[/i], as to why this model turns out more accurate than the previous two, [b]in spite of being DA only[/b]? :rolleyes: [/quote]\n\nI have mentioned it earlier also that in my personal view, there are three factors that come into play when we talk about the accuracy of a gun. Quality of Shooter; quality of gun and quality of ammo. For a gun to shoot accurately, all three have to play their part. SA sahib is a good shooter, no doubt about it. But this PT145 is a good gun too. I found this PT145 far more accurate than the previous two. I posted SA sahib''s result because it was a good test. But I also fired well with this gun and found it more accurate. Look at the group formed with Prvi Parpizan SJHP. Only an accurate gun could do that. With the previous two PT145, I found it hard to hit anywhere on the target from 30 M. With this gun, I hit all 5 bullets within 7-8 inches, all on the target. SA sahib has hit two in the bull from 30 M which can''t be a co-incidence. This gun, in my view, was more consistent and had less dispersion than the other two. \n\nNow the question that why this difference is there. All three guns are almost similar; the only major difference being DAO trigger. The should have performed the same. I should have performed better with DA/SA trigger because I am not very well conversant with a DAO. I fired far more accurately with this gun. [b]I think it is the quality control issue with Taurus. [/b]No manufacturer can make such guns (within the same model) which perform absolutely similar. There are good pieces and there are lemons. In top companies however, this difference between the best and the lowest gun is less. In Taurus, this difference is sometimes quite significant.  This is my personal observation which may or may not be true. :)   \n\n[quote=AK47] Finally, ignore my ignorance, but why were the shots on the ammo comparison picture above placed so high in each corner, I mean the groupings of the Armscor and Prvi Partizan? "Deliberate"? And were the groupings achieved in quick follow up shots, or slow firing? Thanks. Regards. :) [/quote]\nSir, it was aimed deliberate fire.

During my shooting sessions as well, I always thought that such a wonderfully accurate and reliable pistol had quite ordinary grips, at least not to my liking. Grips that should improve the hold and should look elegant as well. \n\nI kept looking for good quality wooden grips for my PT99 as I have a special liking for old looking wooden grips. There were quite a few available on websites. The grips that I liked were phenomenally expensive and those which were within a decent range were not really impressive. The dilemma continued till I was able to search out a good gun smith in a far flung village of Azad Kashmir. I saw his work and thought that he is the man. I asked him to handcraft walnut grips for my PT99.  \n\nInitially, I wanted to have a thumb rest, however, due to peculiar position of the screw on right side grip (for a left hander''s thumb), the thumb rest could not be made. The grips have been completed and few pics are given below. Please don''t mind the sub-standard photography as it has been done in poor light. The grips actually are far more graceful what they look in the pics. To check it''s functionality, I will shoot with the gun tomorrow and see if it has improved the hold. Here are few pics.............. :)\n\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Ammo%20Tests/DSCN6395.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Ammo%20Tests/DSCN6399.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Ammo%20Tests/DSCN6392.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Ammo%20Tests/DSCN6396.jpg[/img]\n\n\nThese handmade walnut grips sure look cool to me.

Nice find, Gilani Sahib!\n\nFor other textures and designs, search the Net. Browse through Hogue''s online shop as well, they have a number of wooden grips for a number of different handguns that could serve as designs for your new grips...\n\n[i]Tip: Try to get some non-checkered grips as well... they look better with the smooth wooden surface...[/i]', ''),

I have searched quite a few sites for grips. there are a large number of them available but the one''s that I liked were costing something like US $ 150 after reaching Pakistan (price+shipment+duty). That is I think too much for a grip. But for copying designs, its ok :D', ''),
