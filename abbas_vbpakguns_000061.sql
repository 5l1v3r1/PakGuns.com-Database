All our products are thoroughly tested before leaving the factory. Those tests include firing with overpressure ammunition as per international regulations.  \nBy performing those tests on each and every pistol we make sure that there is no material failure. In your particular case we have to look into the causes of the incident which could include issues with the ammunition.\n\nTherefore we would like to get back the pistol as well as ammunition from the batch you have used during firing for technical investigations.\nWe will strongly work with you together to find the cause and, after getting the results, decide with you on the way forward.\nUntil those results available, we would like to ask you for your valuable cooperation by passing to us the items and information we need and also we would like to ask you for your patience.\n\nPlease use the following address for further communication on this case [EMAIL="customerservice@caracal.ae"]customerservice@caracal.ae[/EMAIL]\n \nAs mentioned before, we take customer safety very serious.

This was a very smart move, to tack the Winchester name on what  was sure to become a popular sporting number. Unfortunately, American  manufacturers don''t always exhibit this much imagination. Practically  all American and European high-powered sporting rifles are chambered for  the 308 since it will work through the medium- or standard-length  action. The Model 70 bolt-action and 88 lever-action Winchester were the  first American sporting rifles chambered. It was adopted as the  official U.S. military rifle cartridge in 1954, although weapons for it  were not ready until 1957. It is used in the M14. However, it has been  replaced by the 5.56mm NATO as the official U.S. military cartridge.\n\nIn power, the 308 Winchester is superior to the 300 Savage and almost  equal to the 30-06. It delivers about 100 fps less muzzle velocity than  the larger 30-06 with any given bullet weight. The factories used a  special ball-type powder in loading the 308, and it was difficult for  the hand-loader to equal factory ballistics with the powders then  available. However, Winchester-Western Ball powders are now available in  canister lots; shotshell and pistol powders have been on the market for  some time. Most authorities consider the 308 suitable for most North  American big game, although it''s on the light side for moose or big  brown bear. 						\n[/INDENT]', 1, 1, '115.186.118.50', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I repeatedly have been saying all along that make comments/offer suggestions that are [B]RESULT [/B]oriented. Testing, court cases etc etc solve nothing instead only spoil it for the brothers involved, the company and the gun community at large. It also leaves a bad taste in everyone mouth and quite frankly I personally have been disappointed at how our community approached this whole incident. This was not the educated way to handle this situation. I believe that if a problem is being solved amicablely and with friendship why resort to other more ugly means. \r\n\r\nApart from the initial miscommunication between both parties I think the company did a good job of branching out to the gun owner and community as a whole. I must appreciate that Caracal offered to do the following which were all rejected.\r\n\r\na). Replace the gun without inspecting it immediately free of cost and offering the brother involved in the incident an all expense paid trip to the factory to advise them in person.\r\n\r\nb). Send over the gun to the factory for analysis and they would get any 9mm replacement Caracal of their choice.\r\n\r\nc). Get an immediate CASH refund plus Rs. 30,000 in medical expenses. \r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with this picture ?

What I did not know was that our expectations were not that the gun would be replaced but that our understanding of firearm malfunctions is that when a firearm breaks it''s magically transported into the heavens by fairies on unicorns and as soon as they disappear into the clouds, cases of Gold and Silver float down for all to be merry with.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThese are very reasonable terms.

Rifles for the 577 could be made a few pounds lighter than was feasible with 600-caliber guns, which also contributed to its popularity.

This is true for all firearms, be they be handguns/rifles/shotguns or otherwise.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n This is absolutely true.  Sometimes there''s a problem with the ammunition.  Sometimes there''s a problem with the shooter.\r\n\r\n Military and some police train to "clear the jam and continue."  Many shooting schools do the same.  However, the hidden assumption there is that someone is shooting at you, and getting the next shot off is more important than a low-probability safety problem.  Competition shooters who have to fire a minimum number of rounds in a given time will clear and continue.\r\n\r\n Unless someone is shooting at you, if your gun does something strange, STOP.  Unload, clear the chamber, and LOOK DOWN THE BARREL.  Do you see rifling all the way down?  You''re OK.  Do you see anything that ISN''T rifling?  Then you have a problem.\r\n\r\n Obviously, a bullet might be stuck in the barrel.  But it''s not all that unusual for a jacketed bullet to come apart and leave its jacket stuck in the barrel while the core goes downrange.  This will usually "ring" the barrel (put a circular dent on the inside) on the next shot.  It also causes a severe pressure spike when the next bullet goes down the now-constricted barrel.  Split barrels, broken locking lugs, etc. can happen.\r\n\r\n Often, the wrong ammunition can be a problem.  For example, a 20 gauge shell will drop into a 12 gauge chamber, but it won''t fall through the barrel.  If you accidentally load a 20 gauge shell into a 12-gauge, you might figure you had a dud.  Rack the slide, try again.  BOOM.  The barrel was obstructed by a whole 20ga shell ahead of the fired 12ga shell.  You might think it would be hard to mistake a 20ga shell for a 12ga shell, but it has happened to many people. \r\n\r\n After the .40 S&W came out, a similar problem began happening with pistols.  Many .45 magazines will retain a .40 round, and the pistol will chamber it just fine.  Shooter has a misfire, clears the gun as he was trained, pulls the trigger again, BOOM. \r\n\r\n Just because you cycled the action doesn''t mean the "dud" cartridge came out.\r\n\r\n Just because a case or shell was ejected, doesn''t mean the barrel is clear. \r\n\r\n\r\n And just for the record, if you find an obstruction in the barrel, "shoot it out" is not the correct answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n If you''re not in a situation where "clear and continue" is important, take the time to stop and look.

"ayyeee old piece of junk" was my stance, however, later when this gun was in no shape and not in working condition. I realized that it had number of trophies, blue bulls, hog deers and God knows how many birds under its glory and used by teachers. I decided to fix it. I in hurry to fix and restore i actually forgot to take pictures of before. because i never thought at that time of posting it here. However i shall try to explain with words what had happened to it. the barrel was badly scratched, it was partially orange from rust, i couldnt open the gun, had to give it a diesel bath to open with hammer. :P the hammer locks were not striking the firing pin. the wood stock had dents and its finish well, I dont even know how to describe it. and Finally the whole gun was shaking, like it wasnt stable. \r\n\r\nSo what did i do... \r\n\r\n1. gave complete bath of diesel, and fully disassembled the guns \r\n2. learned the process of bluing, Both cold and hot. (from youtube and pakguns)\r\n3. Learned the process of fixing and finishing wood stock.  (sanding, degrease, ironing for dents an polish).\r\n4. Consulted my dad''s Unit gunsmith (who off course is not specialist in shotguns) but still it really helped and maintained my confidence for fixing working parts of the gun. \r\n\r\nNow the gun is in full working condition, i shot personally 25 rounds 4 no. and no misfire or any trouble, it worked perfect and had a good old recoil. The gun is Belgium made from a custom armory who''s name is also engraved. (but because of bluing the markings are lil blury) this was my first proper restoration project, i loved every bit of it. I am not done as yet. I have arranged a wood carver from chinyot and prolly he would make me a new stock with full cravings. furthermore i am thinking of getting the hammers gold plated from gold smith ( with gold water). \r\n\r\nPlease advise on further improvements. and if above mentioned shouldn''t be done. \r\n\r\nP.s my inspiration for this project was 12guage sir who had done several restoration projects. and i would be honored if he share some views on this thread aswell.', 1, 1, '204.14.79.151', 0, 1, 7, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

So is it safe to use this ammo in original Zigana F, Kunani S and Caracal F? \r\n\r\nAs from my search i found:\r\na. 2z is for mp5s and stuff. \r\nb. this wont be a copy of POF round as it is issued to army. \r\nc. for SD.HD off course i will use S&B or American eagle. this is for range purposes where popping +200 rounds aint a big deal.\r\n\r\nPlease advise. \r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '204.14.79.151', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In fact if u search the forum, some time ago I suggested a member who wanted to buy a 92fs to buy a pt92/99 instead. :) In fact I''m totally against the fact that a 600-650 dollar gun (Beretta) is sold at a ridiculous price of 250k. Any person who wants the 92 platform SHOULD go for the taurus....period. In Pakistan, "value for money" is much much higher with the Taurus.\n\nThe reason why I asked jawad bro to clarify his statement was that I thought maybe he has had some bad experiences with the Beretta.\n\nBy the way, the difference between a 92fs and pt92 is of fit and finish (besides the difference in safety lever position). Generally the 92fs is a lot smoother right out of the box than a pt92, which should smoothen out after an initial break-in period. That being said, the 92fs is an AWESOME weapon, and a must have for any enthusiast, its really sad that they are so damn expensive here. :)\n\nSorry for off topic guys :D, @op i''d suggest u to go for the Canik55, but if its a Taurus u want, then pt92/99 is the way to go. :)\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.181.200.171', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

These were listed in catalogs as for Tesching Gewehre, i.e., small game or rook rifles. although popular in Europe, they were not used to any extent elsewhere.\n\nWhen Winchester introduced the 22 WCF in 1885, it not only replaced most other 22 center-fires in the U.S., but also in Europe. The 5.6x33 is of similar performance and was probably made obsolete by the 22 WCF. Both are strictly small game or target cartridges. The Winchester round is still loaded in Europe, where it is known as 5.6x35R Vierling. The 5.x33 was also listed as the 5.7x33. These are said to be for single shot rifles, but must have also been used to some extent in repeating rifles. If not, then why the rimless version?

It was intended for use in the Thompson/Center single shot pistol, and the first barrels were apparently made up during 1972, although Thompson/Center did not offer did not offer it as a standard chambering until 1973. The cartridge is based on the shortened and reformed 30-30 case, which is reduced to 1.6 inches as compared to the original length of 2.04 inches. The case is longer and has greater powder capacity than the 30 Carbine, and when fired in the 10-inch barrel of the Thompson/Center pistol, delivers a rather impressive performance. Muzzle velocities of over 2000 fps are possible with the 125- or 130-grain bullet with muzzle energy of 1160 fpe.[/FONT]\n\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n  [FONT=&quot]Conceived as a superior handgun hunting cartridge, the 30 Herrett has been used successfully on everything from varmints to deer and even elk and moose. However, as loaded and used in the Thompson/Center pistol, it develops less velocity and energy than the standard 30/30 rifle and must be considered on the marginal side as a big game cartridge in the hands of the average hunter. Much of its success has been due in no small part to the skill of the people who have used it. On the other hand, it certainly offers greater power than the 357 Magnum revolver and some consider this adequate for big game in the hands of a skilled hunter and good shot. Certainly it, too, has had its share of success over the years, but again, as with all big game hunting with a handgun, it boils down to the question of who is doing the hunting. What an Elmer Keith or someone in that class can do and what the average person can do are two different things. In any event, the 30 Herrett is an outstanding long-range handgun varmint cartridge, particularly with the 110-, 125- or 130-grain bullet. It has also been used with some success for silhouette shooting, although most shooters prefer the 357 Herrett for this sport. The 30 Herrett is a good example of a wildcat cartridge designed for a specific purpose not really covered by anything in the commercial line, and one that fulfills its design purpose extremely well.

But trust me you''ll be surprised no matter how secret you try to keep it people in your locality do find out. They often come ask for money in the name of "help the poor..." and other fabricated stories and excuses ... (obviously I am not refering to the genuine poor here I am hinting to the fake actors) etc.... But something more interesting than that I''ll tell you a quick story. Its abit long but I''ll wrap it up. And its a true story of this Pathan guy thats friends with my dad here in UK he told me himself of what happened to him.\n\nThis guy the main subject, 1 thing I realised about him is that he loves his food. (Just like me and many others here).\nAfew years ago when h went Pakistan from UK him and afew friends went for a picnic trip to some popular place which I think he said is like some peer Saab mizaar or durbar whatever (Grave/tomb whatever you call it) in some mountainous kind of location or village. They went o stay the night there as they have a couple of rooms where they let the guests stay in. He took lots of extra stuff with him I.e. food ingredients like spices, Ghee etc and said gave it to people who are always present at that place. Probably the "Mureeds" (The devotees who live there) or the people in charge/ looking after the place whatever. They also took a goat with them, slaughtered it and had a Bar-b-Que him and his friends had a "mehfil of gup shup" with Tikka''s and bar b que etc... and had a good time until they called it a night and went inside the room to sleep. He said I think around 10/11 pm someone knocked on the door so one of them from inside opened the door and to their surprise there was a big group of masked armed men, some entered inside the room while their others stood outside to watch over, they demanded their cash and valuables and while demanding they started firing rounds in their feet to scare them off with Bolt Action Rifles 7/8MM Look alikes but what he described looked more like those British-Indian Style 11 Rounds bolt rifles with detachable magazines. They handed them all the money, the main guy I am on about they took Rs, 7000 from him and other valuables and even took the food they had cooked saying you guys must have already been eating too much we will take this as our share. After every little while they would fire a round in the room to cause further terror and he said as they were old style constructed rooms built with stones they could hear bullets circulating across or around the room hitting from one wall to another and then another creating a "ta ta ta" noise after every round was fired. He said I told them that look guys you have got what you wanted (Money Valuables etc) so no need to keep firing the rounds as it will injure somebody. They walked away and soon after one of them stopped outside pointed the Rifle towards the room, where 1 door was open and one was shut, he fired the final shots on the door that was shut the rounds went straight through the door and unfortunately sat behind the door on the bed was the main subject in the story I.e. my dad''s friend, the bullet or bullets went straight through his both legs, through the bones, exiting the other side.\nHe started bleeding heavily without a surprise of course, it was late night, no medical facilities around, his friends put him in the vehicle took him to the nearest main hospital which took at least 2 hours, by the time he got there he had almost died due to heavy bleeding but thanks to Allah he survived and made a full recovery. The police collected all the well known criminals in the village for the so called I D Parade but nothing happened, as usual.\n\nHe said may be it all happened because one his friends who went with them told one of the locals during "gup shup" or while having a chat with the locals there that "hum mein se ye eik dost England se aaya hay" meaning one of our friends with here with us has come for holidays from the UK.', 1, 0, '94.193.15.119', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Most of these were large caliber rifle cartridges. After the war there was a demand for smaller caliber metallic cartridges for revolvers and sporting rifles. Both the 38 Short and Long rimfire date back to this period, possibly the early 1860s. they are listed in the 1869 Folsom Bros. & Co. gun catalog. The Remington Model 1866 revolving rifle was available in 38 rimfire. In 1871 the Remington New Model revolver was advertised as available with an extra 38 rimfire cylinder. The 38 Short rimfire was listed in the 1876 J. Brown & Sons catalog as for Ballard, Remington and Wesson rifles and Allen, Colt, enterprise, Whitney, X.L. and other pistols. This is now an obsolete cartridge, but it was manufactured to about 1940.\n\nThe 38 Short rimfire is in the same class as the center-fire 38 Short Colt. Original loading was a 130-grain bullet and 18 grains of black-powder. Like most older rimfires, the bullet is outside-lubricated. Bullet diameter is .375-inch, the same as the ball fired in 36-caliber cap and ball revolvers. The 38 Short may have originated as a cartridge for breech-loading conversions of these old revolvers. Many catalogs listed the 38 Short as for pistols and revolvers, whereas the 38 Long is shown as a rifle type. The Rollin White patent covering the bored-through cylinder, held by Smith & Wesson, did not expire until 1869, and this undoubtedly had an effect on the use of the rimfire 38 Short for revolvers.', 1, 1, '203.81.207.155', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

So he said that its an Amarican company producing in Turkey. \r\nI don’t think he was been deliberately obtuse. Rather, he was confusing it with the Winchester shotgun line.  Winchester has shifted production to Turkey.  So I guess he thought that it applied to all Turk shotguns.  However I have never heard of a Hatsun bearing the moniker “Jaguar”.\r\n\r\n[I]Pistols:[/I]\r\n\r\nWell… he had the by now ubiquitous CF 98 and the comparatively rarer CZ 83 in .32 calibre. It was NIB asking price 55k.And that’s it. That’s their total handgun line.  I was last here in 2008. At that time they had a CZ 83 .32 caibre NIB. And that’s it. Now that they have a CF 98 as well to keep that lonely CZ 83 company. \r\nHowever the uncle there told me that like shotguns they will be receiving their shipment of handguns next week.

However there are tests conducted prior to any breeding to minimize any future health issues, unfortunately in Pakistan facilities are not upto the mark to carry these out and anyone and everyone breeds 2 good-looking dogs to make a quick buck regardless of the future of the breed and it''s progeny.\n\nAs for Rotties being social and a delight, only in the hands of an equally dominant and experienced owner/handler could that be held true.

I''m a fan of hammer pistols specifically because the first shot (being DA) is an excellent safety against an ND and can, therefore, be carried quite easily without any worries.\n\nHowever, I agree with [B]doc pistol[/B] bro, if this is your first gun then I suggest you get a traditional hammer pistol with an external safety. My first gun was the Canik55 Piranha-F (and I absolutely [B]LOVE[/B] it!) and for about a month or so I used to carry it with the hammer down & safety on (I''ve [B]ALWAYS[/B] carried chambered). Only when I became comfortable carrying a firearm on a daily basis did I start carrying with the safety off.[/QUOTE]\n\n+1..............', 1, 0, '119.157.175.176', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am a government officer in Grade 18 and working in ISB. \r\n\r\nFor all readers information, I like to add that Arms License Section adress has been changed in MOI. It has been shifted to S block now and room number 434. I met the Section Officer, Arms License section and he asked me to apply via my department and I have done so. I sent following documents via official mail from my department to MOI:\r\n\r\n1: Copy of NIC\r\n2: Pictures\r\n3: Profession certificate\r\n4: MOI Application form\r\n\r\nNow, with my application submitted, I have some queries for the members to guide me further from here.\r\n1: I have heard that the Officer of Grade 17 and above are exempted from Police verification. Is this fact true or false.\r\n2:  I am employed in ISB and living on rental apartment here in Islamabad. So I have given the actual address of my home town where my family resides. Will this create a conflict for MOI that I have presented address of outside Islamabad (South Punjab) but working in Islamabad.\r\n3: How long will it take for MOI to issue the approval certificate\r\n4: To which address MOI will send the approval certificate. To my home address or to my department.[/quote]\r\nPost: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?9790&p=300219#post300219]DIY MOI licence[/url]\r\nForum: Licenses (MOI & Provincal) & Legal Issues\r\nAssigned Moderators: N/A\r\n\r\nPosted by: [url=http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?7380-mythical]mythical[/url]\r\nOriginal Content: [quote]i was looking for some dealer who could provide the licence in time and with less burden on my pocket. \nby reading the forum i know that Most of members give advise to get the moi by dealer to avoid any hardships  involved in the process.\nIn order to judge the entire process and for authenticity of my own licence , i decided to do all the work my self . \n\nIt was a rough road ahead :frusty:  of me since most of us havent tried it with CAL. \n\n(Steps might differ in each case.

The 9mm Action Express (9mm AE) is the 41 Action Express case necked-down to 9md rim and retains the 41 AE rebated rim which is the same diameter as the standard 9mm Luger. The advantage of this in the 9mm AE is that the cartridge  offers a larger case that can be used in firearms originally designed for the 9mm Luger without the necessity of changing the bolt or breech face. This will allow a number of 41 AE semi-auto pistols and carbines to be changed to the 9mm version by the installation of kits available for specific weapons. \n\nThe 9mm AE has already been tested in the Uzi semi-auto pistol and specially-altered 1911 Colt models. It is a sort of super 9mm and as such is more powerful than the 38 Colt Super Auto. It has an advantage over the 9mm Winchester Magnum since it is shorter and most 9mm pistols can be adapted to it. Tests in a 10-inch pressure barrel gave muzzle velocities with a 95-grain bullet of 1884 fps at 31,760 CUP and 1903 fps with a 100-grain bullet at 34,880 CUP. these pressures are a bit on the hot side for many semi-auto pistols. On the other hand, these are top loads and can be reduced and still maintain impressive velocities. A 124-grain bullet was measured at 1592 fps and 28,550 CUP, a load which could be digested by most 9mm autos. The 9mm AE is a potentially good self-defense and field cartridge. Of course, converted auto pistols are not likely to have 10-inch barrels, 5 inches being more normal. However, safe loads of around 1500 fps with the 124-grain bullet have been tested in converted Colt 1911 autos with 5-inch barrels. This beats out the 38 Colt Super Automatic and its 130-grain bullet at 1275 fps.', 1, 1, '203.81.207.155', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

To my home address or to my department.\n\n5: Most important is that where I should peruse in MOI that whether my application has been received there or not.

I am a government officer in Grade 18 and working in ISB. \n\n\nFor all readers information, I like to add that Arms License Section adress has been changed in MOI. It has been shifted to S block now and room number 434. I met the Section Officer, Arms License section and he asked me to apply via my department and I have done so. I sent following documents via official mail from my department to MOI:\n\n\n1: Copy of NIC\n2: Pictures\n3: Profession certificate\n4: MOI Application form\n\n\nNow, with my application submitted, I have some queries for the members to guide me further from here.\n\n1: I have heard that the Officer of Grade 17 and above are exempted from Police verification. Is this fact true or false.\n\n2:  I am employed in ISB and living on rental apartment here in Islamabad. So I have given the actual address of my home town where my family resides. Will this create a conflict for MOI that I have presented address of outside Islamabad (South Punjab) but working in Islamabad.\n\n3: How long will it take for MOI to issue the approval certificate\n\n4: To which address MOI will send the approval certificate. To my home address or to my department.\n\n5: Most important is that where I should peruse in MOI that whether my application has been received there or not. In government terms we have a diary number. Where I may get that diary number for my application in MOI.[/QUOTE]\n\nQ#1: Yes! You are exempted from verification.\nQ#2: No issue with the address.\nQ#3: In your case, approval shall take a week or 2 at maximum.\nQ#4: You will get a copy at your office address through which you have applied.

Heym, a noted German gun-maker, and was introduced in 1968 or 1969. It is an offshoot of the 5.6x47R, which is basically a rimmed version of the 222 Remington Magnum, dating back to about 1967. However, the 5.6x50mm case is .118-inch longer than the 222 Remington Magnum and has slightly greater powder capacity, resulting in a higher muzzle velocity. The rimmed version was intended for use in single shot, combination guns and drillings, the rimless cartridge for bolt-action rifles. Neither cartridge is very well known or used to any extent in the U.S.\n\nIn Germany, the 5.6x50mm is used for deer hunting and is loaded with a bullet designed for that purpose. In the U.S. it would be primarily a varmint cartridge.

I have just join this forum because I found a letter 2 days ago lying on a road. It is from Ministry of Interior. The subject is "Weapon procurement authorization (Demand Note) for issuance of PB/NPB Computerized Arms Licence". There is also a form attached "Gift of Weapon". I don''t know what this is all about but from what I get, it''s that someone applied for a license and the application is approved and there is also some kind of 90 days deadline for something or this would be treated cancelled.\nAnyway, What I want to ask is that there is no contact information of the person mentioned in this letter (Only name, Father name, CNIC #). So I think this is something important and I want to get this to the owner. But I don''t understand how to go about it. I searched newspaper for lost and found Ads but didn''t find one related to this. How should I go about it? Should I return this letter to the ministry? There is no address or contact number. Only CNIC #s of the arms dealer and the person who bought this weapon. Also there is weapon no. and other stuff. There is also a tracking No. of the file/application, but I didn''t find any online database for this where I can get the information about the person and reach him. Guide me. Thanks[/QUOTE]\n\nI think you should simply courier it to the Ministry on Interior office in Islamabad and attach a small letter with it that you found this on the road. This looks like a license granted to someone through an MPA/Senator maybe I think because it states "gifted" on it.\n\nPS I have never found something of this sort lying on the road lol. The owner I think is too careless because this document might get misused if in wrong hands because all information is there from name to NIC # to weapon number...', 1, 1, '175.110.248.243', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The Volkskrant newspaper wrote: "the choice of the SIG Sauer earlier this year evoked surprise with representatives of both the arms industry and police unions. During police tests there was a strong preference for a pistol made by Heckler & Koch."[20][21][22] According to the court verdict of 28 March 2011 there were no manipulations involved during the public tender process and the order was finalized.[23][24] On 8 November 2011 the Dutch Minister of Security and Justice formally declared SIG-Sauer in default and immediately dissolved the order following the fourth negative production sample test of PPNL pistols firing Dutch police issue RUAG ACTION 4 NP ammunition by a reputable independent German testing institute (Beschussamt Ulm). Minister Ivo Opstelten found that SIG-Sauer could not deliver the requisite quality in a mass production setting and had some harsh comments on SIG-Sauer: "On the basis of the results of these tests I no longer find it responsible to continue with this pistol. There is no longer enough confidence in the quality of the pistol, nor in the capacity of the manufacturer to improve the quality or safeguard it. All this brings a risk to the safety of police officers on the street." The Minister delegated a (legal) review to examine the possibility of coming to an agreement with one of the other suppliers that has had their pistol operationally tested in the procurement procedure.\r\n\r\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_P250_DCc[/url]', 1, 1, '84.235.92.4', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This accident reminded me of the day when i bought my first new car, i was driving so slow and carefully and you know what happened while i was driving back from the show room, standing on a red light when someone came and hit me from behind. after that i was so heart broken that my brand new car got hit. From that day on i never cared about the car that much and it''s been 5 years now not a single scratch happened since then. i guess when you care about something so much, when your too careful about something that when bad thing is waiting to hit you.\n\nSince last week i start doing the pistol shooting, but this time alone. My fear for guns and the big sound of fire is gone. i shoot every day now and fire almost 200 to 300 bullets a day, sometimes even more. i feel like i''m getting my anger out through the bullets. i now keep my pistol safety off, and bullet in the chamber. i have learned few things about my pistol from a good friend of mine, like how the safety works and how i open the dam thing. it''s like u don''t know how to get up un till you fall. Now i always check my pistol before and after the use but i had unscrew the dam safety thing and took it off for good. \n\nMany of you will not agree to what i have written above but after a careful thought and realising a lot of things like \n\n" who''s fault it was these few people were travelling to work, kids going to school when the bombers attack?" who''s fault it was, when a person dies with a heart attack when he never smoked or drink and alcohol" \n\nI''m not trying to justify what i''m doing, but i thought very carefully about these things and made me realise, sometimes taking risk is better than not taking risk at all. please guys don''t take this in a wrong way. i''m great-full for all of your advice and help. But every body make mistakes and they learn in their own way. Well this is mine.[/B]', 1, 0, '182.177.140.211', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I don''t know what this is all about but from what I get, it''s that someone applied for a license and the application is approved and there is also some kind of 90 days deadline for something or this would be treated cancelled.\nAnyway, What I want to ask is that there is no contact information of the person mentioned in this letter (Only name, Father name, CNIC #). So I think this is something important and I want to get this to the owner. But I don''t understand how to go about it. I searched newspaper for lost and found Ads but didn''t find one related to this. How should I go about it? Should I return this letter to the ministry? There is no address or contact number. Only CNIC #s of the arms dealer and the person who bought this weapon. Also there is weapon no. and other stuff. There is also a tracking No. of the file/application, but I didn''t find any online database for this where I can get the information about the person and reach him. Guide me.

The 45-38 Auto is based on the 45 ACP case necked-down to 38-caliber. The 38-45 Hard Head is the same thing, but instead of using the standard 45 ACP case with it''s 19,000 CUP pressure limit, this one uses the 45 Winchester Magnum or the 451 Detonics case both of which are rated at 38,000 CUP. It allows the use of hotter loads without the danger of case failure.\nThe idea originated with Dean Grennell, of GUN WORLD magazine fame, who has been working on improving the performance of the 1911 Colt auto pistol for some years. The 38-45 Hard Head was fully reported in the November, 1987, issue of GUN WORLD magazine. Velocities in excess of 1500 fps were achieved with a 124-grain bullet from the 5-inch barrel of a modified 1911 type auto pistol.\n\nAttempts to upgrade the ballistics of cartridges fired in the 1911 Model Colt auto are fraught with frustration because of two limiting factors- the weakness of the partially unsupported case and the strength of the action. If you push the cartridge case too far, it will fail, and if you put too much strain on the action, severe damage can result. The answer is a stronger case and stiffer recoil springs, something that Dean Grennell has used successfully on a number of occasions and has done so again here to upgrade the 38-45 Auto and develop a sort of super, 38 Super auto. The 38-45 Hard Head was also tested in a T/C Contender with a 10-inch barrel and developed velocities of over 1700 fps with the 124-grain bullet. Bullets used in the testing were .355-.356-inch diameter (9mm).', 1, 1, '203.81.207.155', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This is due mostly to the 20-guage 3-inch magnum load and the many light, fast 20s now available with 3-inch chambers. The Savage 22 rimfire/20-guage combination gun in their Model 24 handles the 3-inch shell and has had some influence in advancing the poppularity of the 20. This heavy load has the same 1 1/4 ounces od shot as the 16 and takes the 20 out of the light class. In actual field use the 20-guage is now capable of doing almost anything the 16 can do, which makes the difference mostly one of personal preference. However, when it comes to the older 20-guage guns or any without the 3-inch chamber, then the 16 has an edge. There is another area where the 16-guage retains an advantage over the 20, and that is in the use of rifled slugs. The 16-guage slug is adequate for deer and most other big game under ideal conditions, and in the hands of an experienced hunter. On the other hand, the 20-guage slug is just barely in the short-range deer class, regardless of who uses it or the situation. Many experienced hunters believe the 20-guage slug should not be permitted on any big game. Shell lengths for the 20-guage are 2 1/2, 2 7/8 and 3 inches. The top black-powder loading was 2 3/4 drams of powder and 7/8-ounce of shot. It has come a long way since then. American companies load only 2 3/4-inch and 3-inch shells. Steel shot loads are available in both lengths.\n\nNOTE:- THIS IS THE INFO WHAT I HAD ON HAND FOR 20-GUAGE, HOPE MY TWO CENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.\n\nRegards.\nAllah Bless.

The 45-38 auto is based on the 45 ACP case necked-down to accept standard .57-inch bullets. Super 38 ACP barrels are reamed to the new caliber and used in the 45 Colt Auto without any other change.\n\n\nOne of the inherent faults of most semi-auto pistols is there inability to digest cast or swaged lead bullets. Much time and effort has been devoted to correcting this, an the individual hand-loader can effect considerable improvement. The necked design of the 45-38 eliminates any and all feed an chambering problems with light or standard loads. With a straight case, such things as bullet shape, seating depth, hardness of the alloy, etc., are highly critical. With the necked case they can be ignored. The idea behind the 45-38 was to produce a satisfactory target round that would function with any type bullet and any load sufficient to operate the mechanism. However, it should also be an excellent field cartridge because it will allow the use of hunting-type bullets. There is a definite need for an improved auto pistol hunting cartridge. Case configuration is the same as the 38-45 Hard Head but loading data is not inter-changeable. With a 130-grain bullet over 7.5 grains of Unique powder, it produces a muzzle velocity of 1275 fps and muzzle energy of 475 fpe.', 1, 1, '203.81.207.155', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Unfortunately, such exposure can affect one''s self-image. This test is offered in the hopes of putting these false images into a more proper perspective.\r\n \r\n Please circle your answers to each below:\r\n \r\n 1. What is the real meaning of that pink T-shirt with a revolver on it that says: "The ultimate in feminine protection" ?\r\n 1. Obviously a plot by seditious gun fanatics from the NRA.\r\n 2. I''m amazed the pigs have no law banning women''s T-Shirts.\r\n 3. A 9mm for "light days" and a .44 Magnum for "heavy days".\r\n \r\n2. For rape and assault prevention, a whistle is:\r\n 1. All you''ll ever need.\r\n 2. Like I''d use yet another phallic symbol.\r\n 3. The signal to open Fire.\r\n \r\n3. The movie "Thelma & Louise" was:\r\n 1. An insidious plot to stamp out femininity and glorify\r\n violence.\r\n 2. A male ploy to encourage further suppression of women.\r\n 3. A training film.\r\n \r\n4. What was technically wrong with the scene in "Thelma & Louise" where the two women disarmed a Texas State Police Officer.\r\n 1. Tacky, tasteless, and altogether gauche I mean pointing guns;\r\n let alone taking his icky, disgusting gun for their own use.\r\n 2. Only thing I saw wrong was that it took two sisters to disarm\r\n only one man; not realistic at all.\r\n 3. The dummies left a perfectly good shotgun clamped to the\r\n dashboard of the cruiser.\r\n \r\n5. A mouse runs across the kitchen floor. The proper response it to:\r\n 1. Climb onto a high stool and scream for a man to help you.\r\n 2. Is it a male mouse or a female mouse ?\r\n 3. Link up the belt feed to the M-60.\r\n\r\n 6. You are discussing the local crime stats with your neighbor,\r\n Ralph, who suggests you buy a .25 caliber pistol for defense. You reply:\r\n 1. Never! A woman who buys a gun has humiliatingly surrendered to the evil ethos of mindless brute force!\r\n 2. Yeah, like I''m supposed to stand there and let old fat gut Ralph leer and drool like he usually does. Men are such pigs !\r\n 3. Only to plant in the dead hand of the next little weasel stupid enough to give me whimpy advice like that!\r\n\r\n 7. What is your reaction to the concept of a bra holster ? \r\n 1. Obscene ! The icon of death with the symbol of nurturing.\r\n 2. What''s a bra ?\r\n 3. As long as it doesn''t get in the way of my shoulder sling.\r\n\r\n 8. Define "male."\r\n 1. The first syllable of "malevolence," which in turn is only one letter short of "male violence."\r\n 2. An animal with a one track mind. A brute who feels the need to try to control, suppress, double-talk all women everywhere.\r\n 3. A quaint anachronism, once useful for protection of females, but rendered obsolete by contemporary firepower.\r\n\r\n 9. Where, in the scheme of things defensive, do such spray products as Mace and CapStun belong?\r\n 1. Nowhere! If you just show your attacker compassion and understanding, you won''t need nasty things like that.\r\n 2. Yet more products of questionable effect manufactured by the male dominated industrial complex to make women feel somewhat secure.\r\n 3. In the medicine cabinet; real women use mace instead of Feminique.\r\n \r\n10. You are cornered in your home by a knife-wielding intruder. He ignores your command to halt, and charges you with the knife upraised. How many shots should you fire?\r\n 1. None. It would be better to die or submit than sacrifice moral victory by using deadly force. How unseemly and gauche.\r\n 2. As many as I had, assuming the male dominated firearms industry would sell me a gun; or let alone ammunition in the first place.\r\n 3. A minimum of fifty shots.

I started hunting with an AIR GUN (DIANA) since i was 7 years old. I live on the bank of river Indus, so hunting species like ducks(almost of all kinds), teeters (black & brown), quails, rabbits, doves, etc are in abundance here. Though not as much as used to be, because their number has significantly decreased due to increase in the number of hunters and new innovations in hunting. Pakguns is a very useful platform for sharing hunting experiences and also for learning different hunting tactics.

DJ one does not learn to walk by running first!! Accidents happen!!???? Seems like you are living in lala land!! WAKE UP BEFORE YOU HURT SOMEONE!!! You have no clue about how to safely handle a firearm, and you took the safety out!! This is real life not a movie!!! Here is a safety procedure for you and GOD HELP YOU!\n[B]1. Treat all guns as if they are loaded. [/B]\nAlways assume that a gun is loaded even if you think it is unloaded. Every time a gun is handled for any reason, check to see that it is unloaded FIRST. If you are unable to check a gun to see if it is unloaded, leave it alone and seek help from someone more knowledgeable about guns.\n \n[B]2. Keep the gun pointed in the safest possible direction.[/B]>\n Always be aware of where a gun is pointing. A "safe direction" is one where an accidental discharge of the gun will not cause injury or damage. Only point a gun at an object you intend to shoot. Never point a gun toward yourself or another person.\n \n[B]3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.[/B]\nAlways keep your finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot. Even though it may be comfortable to rest your finger on the trigger, it also is unsafe. If you are moving around with your finger on the trigger and stumble or fall, you could inadvertently pull the trigger. Sudden loud noises or movements can result in an accidental discharge because there is a natural tendency to tighten the muscles when startled. The trigger is for firing and the handle is for handling.\n \n[B]4. Know your target, its surroundings and beyond.  [/B]\nCheck that the areas in front of and behind your target are safe before shooting. Be aware that if the bullet misses or completely passes through the target, it could strike a person or object. Identify the target and make sure it is what you intend to shoot. If you are in doubt, DON''T SHOOT! Never fire at a target that is only a movement, color, sound or unidentifiable shape. Be aware of all the people around you before you shoot.\n \n[B]5. Know how to properly operate your gun.  [/B]\n It is important to become thoroughly familiar with your gun. You should know its mechanical characteristics including how to properly load, unload and clear a malfunction from your gun. Obviously, not all guns are mechanically the same. Never assume that what applies to one make or model is exactly applicable to another. You should direct questions regarding the operation of your gun to your firearms dealer, or contact the manufacturer directly.\n \n[B]6. Store your gun safely and securely to prevent unauthorized use. Guns and ammunition should be stored separately.[/B]\n When the gun is not in your hands, you must still think of safety. Use a California-approved firearms safety device on the gun, such as a trigger lock or cable lock, so it cannot be fired. Store it unloaded in a locked container, such as a California-approved lock box or a gun safe. Store your gun in a different location than the ammunition. For maximum safety you should use both a locking device and a storage container.', 1, 0, '173.209.122.102', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I have just join this forum because I found a letter 2 days ago lying on a road. It is from Ministry of Interior. The subject is "Weapon procurement authorization (Demand Note) for issuance of PB/NPB Computerized Arms Licence". There is also a form attached "Gift of Weapon". I don''t know what this is all about but from what I get, it''s that someone applied for a license and the application is approved and there is also some kind of 90 days deadline for something or this would be treated cancelled.\nAnyway, What I want to ask is that there is no contact information of the person mentioned in this letter (Only name, Father name, CNIC #). So I think this is something important and I want to get this to the owner. But I don''t understand how to go about it. I searched newspaper for lost and found Ads but didn''t find one related to this. How should I go about it? Should I return this letter to the ministry? There is no address or contact number. Only CNIC #s of the arms dealer and the person who bought this weapon. Also there is weapon no. and other stuff. There is also a tracking No. of the file/application, but I didn''t find any online database for this where I can get the information about the person and reach him. Guide me. Thanks[/QUOTE]\n\nBro! Kindly go to any NADRA Kiosk which are established for CNIC verification. They will charge like Rs. 50/-. They will give a page which will have details of CNIC.

The TP-9 simply dispenses with the whole decocking headache by being equipped with a decocker; the TP-9 may be a striker-fired gun, but it behaves like a typical hammer pistol. Also, using the TP-9''s mags don''t cut your fingers, making it more "user friendly"! :p\n\nIn the end, both are excellent guns; reliable, robust, and very well built.

However, in more recent times it has re-surfaced as a chambering for Thompson/Center Contender single sot pistols, and in this mode, it really comes into its own. The cartridge was developed by gunsmith Keith Davis and first announced in an article by Dan Cotterman appearing in the January 1964 issue of GUN WORLD magazine. The original purpose for the design was to bring the velocity of the 38-caliber revolver up to the then-advertised 1410 fps with the 158-grain bullet. Actual velocity is, of course, some 299 to 300 fps below that figure. Ammunition catalogs no longer list the 158-grain 357 Magnum at anything like 1410 fps. In any event, the 357/44 B&D did achieve its design goal by developing velocities in the revolver over 1400 fps. The case is based on the 44 Magnum  necked-down without any other change. \n\nThe 357/44 B&D is another wildcat that started off as one thing (a super 38 revolver cartridge) and ended up as something else (a silhouette and hunting round for single shot pistols). What is interesting about this cartridge is that although smaller than the 357 Herrett. It produces equal or slightly superior ballistics. It is a potent and effective cartridge for either metallic silhouette or game shooting with 110 up to 158 grains. As a field cartridge, it will cover the spectrum from small game and varmints up to deer, although it''s a bit marginal for the latter. cases are very easy to make, requiring only a full-length sizing and seating die. In a 10-inch barrel of T/C Center Contender a 110-grain bullet loaded over 24 grains 0f "296" powder produces a muzzle velocity of 2120 fps and muzzle energy at 1100 fpe level. On th other hand, a 158-grain bullet loaded over 24 grains of "296" powder produces 2045 fps of muzzle velocity and 1465 fpe of muzzle energy.', 1, 1, '203.81.207.155', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

DJ one does not learn to walk by running first!! Accidents happen!!???? Seems like you are living in lala land!! WAKE UP BEFORE YOU HURT SOMEONE!!! You have no clue about how to safely handle a firearm, and you took the safety out!! This is real life not a movie!!! Here is a safety procedure for you and GOD HELP YOU!\n[B]1. Treat all guns as if they are loaded. [/B]\nAlways assume that a gun is loaded even if you think it is unloaded. Every time a gun is handled for any reason, check to see that it is unloaded FIRST. If you are unable to check a gun to see if it is unloaded, leave it alone and seek help from someone more knowledgeable about guns.\n \n[B]2. Keep the gun pointed in the safest possible direction.[/B]>\n Always be aware of where a gun is pointing. A "safe direction" is one where an accidental discharge of the gun will not cause injury or damage. Only point a gun at an object you intend to shoot. Never point a gun toward yourself or another person.\n \n[B]3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.[/B]\nAlways keep your finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot. Even though it may be comfortable to rest your finger on the trigger, it also is unsafe. If you are moving around with your finger on the trigger and stumble or fall, you could inadvertently pull the trigger. Sudden loud noises or movements can result in an accidental discharge because there is a natural tendency to tighten the muscles when startled. The trigger is for firing and the handle is for handling.\n \n[B]4. Know your target, its surroundings and beyond.  [/B]\nCheck that the areas in front of and behind your target are safe before shooting. Be aware that if the bullet misses or completely passes through the target, it could strike a person or object. Identify the target and make sure it is what you intend to shoot. If you are in doubt, DON''T SHOOT! Never fire at a target that is only a movement, color, sound or unidentifiable shape. Be aware of all the people around you before you shoot.\n \n[B]5. Know how to properly operate your gun.  [/B]\n It is important to become thoroughly familiar with your gun. You should know its mechanical characteristics including how to properly load, unload and clear a malfunction from your gun. Obviously, not all guns are mechanically the same. Never assume that what applies to one make or model is exactly applicable to another. You should direct questions regarding the operation of your gun to your firearms dealer, or contact the manufacturer directly.\n \n[B]6. Store your gun safely and securely to prevent unauthorized use. Guns and ammunition should be stored separately.[/B]\n When the gun is not in your hands, you must still think of safety. Use a California-approved firearms safety device on the gun, such as a trigger lock or cable lock, so it cannot be fired. Store it unloaded in a locked container, such as a California-approved lock box or a gun safe. Store your gun in a different location than the ammunition. For maximum safety you should use both a locking device and a storage container.[/QUOTE]\n+1\n@ darkjustice\naccidents do happen but that doesnot mean to stop doing the right thing and shift to the more dangerous things, infact you have to look for improvement, look for your own mistakes and correct them....consider dodo23 thread...its good...anywayz everyone has his/her own way of handling things.....good luck with whatever you decide.', 1, 0, '110.38.78.85', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The 41 Short was introduced in 1863 or ''64. It was originally called the 41-100 rimfire. The National derringer was patented by Daniel Moore in 1861 and ''63. It was made by National from its introduction to 1870 when the company was purchased by Colt. From about 1872 to 1890 this rotating barrel, single shot derringer was manufactured by Colt. They also adapted the 41 Short to the Thuer-patented or third model derringer and the House pistol or "Cloverleaf" cylinder model of 1871. Derringers made by Allen, enterprise,Williamson, X.L. and others were also of 41 Short caliber. The Remington over/under or double derringer manufactured from 1866 to 1935 was perhaps the most famous and popular of the lot. Several low-priced pocket revolvers were chambered for the 41 Short.

Me and my immediate family has gone through a car-capping/car-jacking situation and 2 cases and car dacoity in the last 5 years. Plus in the last 2 months, I have seen cases of auto-theft and house dacoity amongst extended family / acquiantensces. All this besides hearing urban myths/rumours of various kinds of evil incidents. \n\nAt a certain point of time, I decided that it would be best for me to arm myself to protect me and my family. I should point out, that till very recently I was actually had very much anti-gun opinions. But when a friend of mine suggested that he can arrange for a license, I jumped at the opportunity and gave him all the requisite docs/photos. I expect the license to arrive in a week or two. \n\nAnyways, that is my contextual background. After applying for the license, I began to research on what sort of weapon should I actually buy. \n\nFirst question was calibers. After having researched and asking around a few friends, the general concensus was that for a newbie, 9mm would be best. It has sufficient fire power whilst being able to manage the recoil issue as well for a newbie.\n\nThen my second issue was the type of gun. My issue with choosing a gun was that I did not even know what sort of features should I look for in a gun as a newbie. I cam across all sorts of lingos like Single Action/Double Action/Double Action Only/Quick Action/etc. Other terms like decocker/slide safety/trigger safety/etc. \n\nI asked friends what they were and what features should one look for in a first gun. They all seemed to suggest that they choice is really personal on how the weapon feels in the hand and "if they like the look" of the weapon. I could NOT get that. They always side it was like buying a phone. Honestly when I buy a new cell phone, then the feel and the look of the cell is a factor but I do look at specs like speed / memory size / and camera pixel quality. Unfortunately I do not even know what to look for in my first gun. I would appreciate if you can help in this regard.\n\nBut in any case, I read a number of reviews and made the following choices for the first potential gun. \n\n1. CF98\n2. Canik 555 TP9\n3. Cougar 8000\n4. Sarsilmaz CM9\n\nMy primary objective and intended use are as follows:\n1. Home Defense: Home defense is the primary objective. However, with three children in the house, I do not want to have to deal with big rifles / shotguns. I much prefer a pistol. Given the fact that I have 3 children, safety features of the gun are of big importance to me. \n\n2. Concealed Carry (infrequent): I do not intend to carry it concealed everyday, but perhaps during certain family excursions when I expect to be coming back at home late at night (family weddings / dinner parties / etc). My most probable areas of carry would be at the waist during time I am out of the car or in the ankle whilst driving.\n\nMy biudget is in the range of about 50k-60k. I have heard that recently the turkish guns have escalated in price and thus the prices indicated in [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/content.php?224-Pakistan-gun-price-9mm-pistol-shotgun-forum-hollow[/URL] might actually not hold true anymore. That would leave me with only CF98 being a probable contender. Please advise if what I am thinking is correct or are the prices of Caniks/etc still the range indicated in the post.\n\nPlus I would also appreciate if you can recommend any other pistol I may have missed out on. I would also appreciate if you can shed light on what features to look for in the first gun, with specific references to actiontype/ bore axis / safety features / etc.', 1, 0, '119.155.7.145', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It''s polymer continuation in shape of the PX4 Storm is worth around 300K''s! Beretta Cougar if imported would similarily stand around 250-300K''s if imported. Hence, by all aspects, Stoegar Cougar even at today''s prices retains a good value-for-money quotient here in Pakistan. \n\nAs regards the Vikings durability, it''s of no concern to 99% of our users. The will last you for long.\n \nYes, I''ve read even about cracks within the Viking frame, yet can''t exactly remember the source.\n\nMoreover, some close friends too have had their Viking experience and were not pretty convinced about it''s "reputed" robustness, deeming that there are other better options around, same price.\n\nFinally, it''s been my personal opinion, that the manufacturer has not been satisfied with a single model of the Viking and the frequent changes must have been a process of improvisation efforts, probably as a response to durability issues that we over here do not know much about, since the Viking''s home ground is a relatively "close circuit origin", still.\n\nIf the initial Viking had been flawless, I personally do not understand why another, heavier model needed to be manufactured with steel inserts for further fortification of the frame. Why make a well-performing gun heavier or combine polymer with more steel inside the frame, if the lighter one, all polymer had no complains?\n\nFinally, there is the all steel model launched just recently.\n\nHence, I''d prefer the uniform Stoeger Cougar, even though, I feel i''m gonna get torpedoed down here by Junooni "Vikings", lol!\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.188.246.232', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I have been going through pakguns.com for the last couple of day. I have found it very informative and interesting especially for guns & hunting lovers. Some of the threads are really captivating and thrilling. I myself have a passion for hunting. By profession I am a Lecturer at a Govt College. I started hunting with an AIR GUN (DIANA) since i was 7 years old. I live on the bank of river Indus, so hunting species like ducks(almost of all kinds), teeters (black & brown), quails, rabbits, doves, etc are in abundance here. Though not as much as used to be, because their number has significantly decreased due to increase in the number of hunters and new innovations in hunting. Pakguns is a very useful platform for sharing hunting experiences and also for learning different hunting tactics. I like and appreciate the work of the admins and moderators of this forum that they have arranged so many things quite systematically. \nlooking forward to having a positive and fruitful communication.\nThanks to all.[/QUOTE]\n\nWelcome to the community bro. No doubt its a great place to learn and share. Truly, this forum has saved me from a big loss.

In US safety is the most important thing and always considered first.\n\nThe gun you had been mentioning in your posts, does not have similar features. Lets assume you have your pistol chambered, cocked, either in your belt holster, pocket or hand and due to some reasons you stumble, fall and you gun gets a jolt enough to release the spring and your gun goes bang. Now would you know which direction your muzzle was and what was in the direction of muzzle? You don''t!

Like I said, I actually thought about the different situations in which I would find myself where I would want to use the guns. ANd I realized that the situation would not allow me to cock a gun and shoot. Which is why I think it is necessary to have the gun chambered if one is carrying to. Plus I do realize that speed become more important than accuracy in times like these. It is said that it takes 1.5 second for a trained person to remove the gun from the holster and aim it. That is an eternity. Especially in Karachi where the bad guy also has a gun. Add to that the element of removing from an IWB / ankle holster. That time can easily go to 2 seconds. That is why I have made conscious decisions of when to use the weapon and when not. Plus I have also gone through loads of videos and articles at [URL="http://www.handgunsmag.com/tactics-and-training/"]Handgunsmag.com[/URL]. I found them to be very informative and educational. Especially some of the videos on how to handle carjacking incidents. Problem is that Pakistan does not have serious firearm training schools, let alone tactical training. I am seriously thinking of where to go for training. I cannot afford a membership to the PNS Karsaz.

Even though your pistol manufacturer tried to make it look alike and claims it has five levels of safety but it does not have GLOCK''s patented safe action. If it was just like Glock then why did they added an external safety??? Here is a copy and paste from Glock site.\n\n[I]GLOCK&#8217;s revolutionary &#8220;Safe Action&#8221;® System provides a consistent trigger pull from the first to the last round. The three automatic independently operating mechanical safeties are built into the fire control system of the pistol. All three safeties disengage sequentially as the trigger is pulled and automatically reengage when the trigger is released. This safe, simple and fast system allows the user to concentrate fully on tactical tasks, particularly while under stress. It is safe if dropped and functional at temperatures from -40° to 122° Fahrenheit.\n\n[/I]Is this statement comforting? Knowing company''s reputation, Absolutely. Your gun has a hammer while Glocks has striker pin. Results may be the same but functionality is different. If you go to youtube, you will find enough videos to explain safety systems of many guns including Glocks. Watch for information not for opinions.

Thanx :)[/QUOTE]\n\nI have both pistols in my house. Stoeger is my personal carry pistol, bought Viking for my younger brother. They are both good pistols but not the bestt options for conceal carry. I found my Stoeger heavy to carry and its abit bulky aswell. Its ok in Winter under your jacket but in summer under a thin Kameez it will be noticable. The only time I have ever been appraoched by the police asking me if I had a pistol under my Kameez was the first day I started carrying the Stoeger, after switching from carrying the TT all my life before which was nice and slim. I then bought a belly holster which I think is quite good nicely conceals most guns including the Stoegar under the kameez. Viking is also good, reliable and accurate with high Magazine Capacity of 18 Rounds but its a big/ full size handgun and may not very concealable, specially in summer.

The license for pistol is in the name of my wife. I was told by a dealer that if I put my self as a retainer in the license then I can also use the pistol  provided the main licensee is also with me at the time when it is used. Is this correct? Also I am told that arms cannot be carried in car in view of section 144. If so, how do I bring the gun from the shop without carrying it in the car or take it to the shooting range for practice. Seems odd to me\n\nI would also need advise of experienced members on which pistol and shot gun to buy for self defense.

Before any newbie just wants to buy a gun to carry and feel secure, they should first get familiar with firearms. At least the basics!

Like I said, I actually thought about the different situations in which I would find myself where I would want to use the guns. ANd I realized that the situation would not allow me to cock a gun and shoot. Which is why I think it is necessary to have the gun chambered if one is carrying to. Plus I do realize that speed become more important than accuracy in times like these. It is said that it takes 1.5 second for a trained person to remove the gun from the holster and aim it. That is an eternity. Especially in Karachi where the bad guy also has a gun. Add to that the element of removing from an IWB / ankle holster. That time can easily go to 2 seconds. That is why I have made conscious decisions of when to use the weapon and when not. Plus I have also gone through loads of videos and articles at [URL="http://www.handgunsmag.com/tactics-and-training/"]Handgunsmag.com[/URL]. I found them to be very informative and educational. Especially some of the videos on how to handle carjacking incidents. Problem is that Pakistan does not have serious firearm training schools, let alone tactical training. I am seriously thinking of where to go for training. I cannot afford a membership to the PNS Karsaz.

Even with the fastest draw, do you think it would be possible to draw your weapon? Always be vigilant and pre-empt.

Be careful. Some of the things which I learnt the hard way are: 1. Do not use normal gun oil or mineral oil for anything and especially for lubricating the air piston. It can cause "dieseling" which can damage the air cylinder. 2. Also normal mineral oils can deteriorate rubber seals which are a vital part of airguns. For lubrication of piston area special synthetic oil with high flash point is used. The good air guns like Diana or Gamo normally do not require such lubrication until thousands of pellets are fired. Also Clean/oil barrel very sparingly. May be after 500 or 1000 shots. You may see some improvement in accuracy. This can be done with a wire brush lightly soaked with gun oil as mentioned in earlier post. In any case avoid contamination of barrel rubber seal with the oil and wipe off excess oil immediately.\n\n\nIn my personal opinion airguns should be left as they are. The pistons and cylinder, trigger etc normally do not require additional lubrication. The factory lubrication is sufficient. You can use very little amount of grease or some motor oil on hinges of break barrel air gun. But do wipe any excess oil so that it doesn''t flow to other parts i.e., wooden or synthetic stock, rubber seals etc. Also avoid storing air guns in vertical position for long time. If stored in this position the oil in barrel or in the cylinder area may drain and may contaminate rubber seals or damage the stock.', 1, 0, '199.58.84.36', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is a polymer-framed striker-fired pistol and comes with an extra backstrap and practically 2 kydex holsters.

In other words, the TP-9 is a striker-fired gun that works like a traditional DA/SA hammer pistol.\n\nI personally really like this DA/SA setup.

I do possess arms licenses. They have been verified by the state and the federation. I pay my annual tax for possessing these licenses very year. They have been registered at the National Bank head office. The weapon that I buy has been entered at the DC office as well as the local police station both of whom require my full particulars.\nIn order to procure a license we have to be verified by the police who will then issue a certificate. After visiting the home of th applicant and procuring 2 guarantees from immediate neighbours. The certificate will enable the Home Sec to issue a letter allowing the aplicant to go ahead with the process. Once the challan is deposited in the bank. He will have to appear for bomertic scans and picture taking and data entry. The license will have a bar code which ensures traceability.\nThe weapon has to be purchased within a time frame after which the purchase period lapses. Once the purchase has taken place the license will be submitted to the local P.S along with full particulars as well as pics cnic copies and license copies along with fired empties of the weapon.\nLater a separate application has to be sent to the Home department for 144 permit which will enable carrying of the weapon. The applicant has to have a valid reason to carry. And if approved he will obtain a permit a permit valid for 90 days only. A copy of the permit wil then be sent to the DG rangers as well as the IGP. During snap checking the police will conform both from the headquarters as well as the local thana as to weahter the lic is real or not.\nThis is how a law abiding citizen gets a license.

It is a hex receiver gun, made in the Tula plant. Here in America we get these for about... $80 to $130. Even higher for the other more desirable models like the M44 or the ex snipers. This one was most likely used in WW2. \n\nIt appears to have been arsenal refinished by the Russians most likely after the war, though it doesn''t seem to be counterbored. The bolt is made of mix and match parts from different factories, as the Russians took them apart, threw the parts in a pile, and put them back together. The bolt handle is Tula, the cocking knob is Izhvesk. Some of the bolt parts are more crude than others, leading me to believe that some of the parts were made during peak production times during the war. The cocking knob seems to have been made by broken machining equipment. It functions fine, but it''s very crudely made.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1812_zps0871d563.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nHere is my Ruger Redhawk Hunter with a 7.5" barrel in .44 Magnum. Because .44 specials cost about the same as the magnums here, I mainly shoot magnums, as the recoil doesn''t bother me. In this picture, it''s equipped with a Pachmayr "Decelerator" soft rubber grip, which works great. However, I have grown a liking towards the factory smooth wood grips.\n\nIt is pictured below with some 340 gr +P+ Buffalo Bore .44 Magnum ammunition. It gets 1425 FPS out of a 7.5" barrel, and packs a big punch. I don''t shoot these much, since after shipping they cost about $2.60 per round, whereas standard 240 grain magnum loads only cost me $0.70 per shot. I''d rather save these rounds for something special.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1530_zps4b8d10ab.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1533_zps9fe70066.jpg[/IMG]\n\nHere it is after a day at the range.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/magnum_zps9b5d2677.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nHere it is with the factory smooth wood grips. The only gripe I have with these is that the trigger guard smacks my support hand finger. It doesn''t hurt, but it is annoying.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1592_zps2c84881d.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nHere is my Springfield Armory "GI" 1911, in .45 ACP. The GI is, or was, Springfield Armory''s basic entry level 1911, made to resemble the 1911A1 that was carried in WW2 and the Korea and Vietnam wars (or police action, if referring to Korea). The frame and slide is made of carbon steel, and forged by Imbel in Brazil. Some of the Springfield 1911''s were totally made and completed by Imbel, and some of their higher end models only had the frames and slides forged by Imbel, and the gun was completed in America by Springfield. I''m pretty sure this one was completely made there in 2003.\n\nI changed the grips to checkered wood grips, swapped the A1 short trigger for a longer aluminum Cylinder and Slide trigger, and removed the arched mainspring housing and replaced it with a Smith and Alexander straight mainspring housing with a mag well. I also have other grips for it which fill the gap between the bottom of the grip and mag well, but I prefer these ones. I had a gunsmith polish up some of the moving parts, but I''m not sure how much better that made the gun, if at all haha. \n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1785_zps88a94896.jpg[/IMG]\n\nDon''t mind the electrical tape on the grip safety. I removed it since this picture. The way I grip the gun (as high as I can get to bore axis), sometimes my palm wouldn''t engage the grip safety as it''s so high it is pressing the tang of the grip safety more than the grip safety itself, so I taped the safety down to counter this, which helped a lot. I will eventually fix this by installing a beavertail grip safety with a "memory bump", like you see on some other 1911''s. This will remedy my problem. I also plan to have the sights and hammer swapped out too.\n\nSpringfield Armory is a great company. Their customer service is outstanding! I had some FTF problems, and others where the slide would lock back prematurely. I sent it in to Springfield. They paid for shipping, and they fixed it for me for free. They replaced the extractor, reamed the chamber (not sure why, I think it''s standard procedure to make sure it''s in spec), and replaced the plunger tube and assembly. The problems have been gone since.\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1792_zps1d7e16ee.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1638_zps1b02ccfb.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c89/jakashh/Guns/IMAG1640_zpsba47a059.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI also have another gun that is, according to our government, considered a handgun, but only because it has no buttstock so that it would be allowed into the country for import.

I was as excited as you, when I came across this forum over a year ago when I was doing abit of online research on Zastava M57, after purchasing a couple of them. One reason for my excitement was that since my very young age I''ve had a natural love for guns but back where I spent ma childhood, according to my elders if you had an interest in guns or Fire Arms, sadly you were labelled as some one bad, some one with negative or anti-social interests and someone with no interest in education or academics, which I strongly disagreed with but sadly being so Young and alone (in terms of interest) there was not much I could do to fight or argue my case.\n\n I am glade finally there is now a forum (from Pakistan) where civilised, law abiding decent Pakistani and other citizens can express and share their common interests and opinions in fire arms, sports shooting, hunting, and other leisure and re-creational activities. Alhumdulillah academically I did well and now with the grace of Allah I''ve a very decent job like the majority of PG Friends from all types of different fields and backgrounds, so I hope this proves the point to them like it has to the many globally that not every man with a gun is a Criminals, if not I dont really care what ppl think now. I''ve learnt alot and gained alot of knowledge from reading different threads shared by fellow PG''s during the last year and so, I probaby wouldn''t have been able to gain this much in my entire life else where. Its been a great help. If it wasnt for the help and knowledge from PG I would''t have been ble to make the right choices for myself, brothers and other friends.

They had locked the house gate, shut the bedroom door to call it a night, as it was around 9/10pm in the Winter (in the month of January), someone knocked on the house main (metal) gate, my Uncle armed himself with his M16 Rifle, opened the bedroom door, his plan was to climb up to the top floor via the stairs in the varanda and look down from above the ceiling which is open space surrounded by walls only, to check who is outside the main gate in the street, but soon as he opened his bedroom door he was confronted by 4 Masked BG''s outside his bedroom door, 2 put guns to his head from left and right while 1 of them took the rifle off his hands, and there was nothing he could do as his wife and children including his 2 yrs old daughter were all inside the bedroom while rest of the family members were about to sleep in the other rooms (ladies only because other uncle and grandmother had gone to perform Hajj). One of the BG&#8217;s went inside the bedroom and put a handgun uncle&#8217;s 2 yrs daughter''s head while she was fast asleep in bed and said "try anything clever and we will blow her head off". The BG&#8217;S immediately started searching the drawers, cupboards etc, and demanded Cash from him. They even started taking the pillow covers off the pillows in a desperate attempt to find cash and other valuables. One of them sarcastically said "We''ve cut your telephone wire too" which they had, but luckily they had another telephone line in another room those days and one of the ladies rang my Aunty''s house, she and her brother in law immediately came but couldn&#8217;t get inside the house because the house gate was locked from inside, the BG''s had actually gained entry into the house by climbing up to the neighbors guest house wall and from that wall onto our ceiling then climbing down quietly inside the house via the stair case. 1 of them had knocked on the house main gate from inside but obviously when you are inside the bedroom you can&#8217;t really tell if the gate was knocked on from inside or outside. That''s why now every time I hear a knock on the main house gate at night time the first thing I always check in the window is the area outside the bedroom door to make sure it is clear. Anyway my Aunty lot starting banging on the house gate very loudly, my uncle later said one BG said to another lets go their "Rishte Daars are here lets go". Luckily they left, but with the M16, and my uncle''s wallet. Obviously their intention was to collect alot more than but they were interrupted. While they climbed up the stairs my uncle ran to his brother''s room to pick up another rifle and open fire on them from top of the roof while they were climbing down out of the house BUT BUT&#8230;NOW HERE COMES THE LESSON OR ADVICE for us all in here. He [U]could not[/U] find the other 2 Assault Rifles, they had in the house, [U]Because[/U] his elder brothers had kept and locked them somewhere and had not told him or any one where they were so no one remembered where they were, along with 6 Magazines and a box of 1000 Rounds Ammo. Then my uncle desperately ran for my grandfather''s single shot lever action 12 Bore rifle to take a few shots while they were escaping, and he found the rifle BUT couldn&#8217;t find the Ammo Belt for it. Hence, USELESS. So the BG&#8217;s successfully escaped, leaving him mentally and emotionally scarred for a long time after that.\n\nNow as we can see, there is a series of things that lead to failure on our side and the BG&#8217;s scoring high during the incident.\n\n1) Leaving the stair case door leading to the upper ceiling floor unlocked, which they used to gain entry inside the house. Despite my dad had previously warned them not to.\n\n2) Most importantly Miss-Management and &#8220;ZERO&#8221; PLANNING.\n Having plenty of Weapons and Ammo is not just the only thing required but Good Planning and Management are also extremely important. Because its not just a case of buying an expensive, reliable car, a good driver behind the wheel is also very important.\n\nI think the HD guns should be kept where immediate access can be gained within seconds because when you get an unwanted surprise from unwanted/ unexpected guests in the house you only have afew seconds to retaliate or response. That too if you are lucky. 1 second delay and you may be surrounded by guns pointing to your skull and then you may be helpless along with your family. \nMost of us will probably remember the attempted home invasion of our Brave and Proud PG brother Om Khan&#8217;s Incident about a year or two ago. Had he not had his CF98 under belt/ Chambered and had he not responded immediately soon as he saw one of the BG''s pulling out a TT, God knows what would have happened to him or them. Even then he took a bullet to his chest despite being so quick and ready. So imagine the rest of us where in most cases our guns are locked in our Cupboards and boxes far up where most can&#8217;t reach or gain instant access. In that case Forget it we are not going to do anything, you might as well surrender to the BG''s and let them rule your house or premises. Its good to be careful and cautious when it comes to handling guns with safety but often we almost develop Phobia or a Paranoia from touching or even getting too close to a gun or guns. What&#8217;s the point having one in the house then. For decoration. They should be kept ready for instant access or reach somewhere most BG''s will not find or suspect to find them easily but you will.\n\nHowever the BG''s were caught about 8 months later and the rifle along afew other items they took were recovered from them. Out of the 4 BG''s, Two, The Ring Leader and another one turned out to be far relative of ours. The other 2 were their friends. Infact the ringleader was kind of closely related. Who admitted he/they (BG''s) knew the main man responsible for looking after the house had gone to Hajj with his mother and they thought there were ladies only in the house and were unaware of the fact my other uncle had come on a vacation from Dubai and was present in the house at the time of the invasion which they said was abit of a surprise to them. According to the ring leader their plan was to lock all the ladies in one room and loot the house.\n\nThe main reason I shared this story with PG friends here is because I think you learn from your experiences and this might give them hints and tips for home defence planning and improvements.

CF98 is designed for performance not looks. if these HP77, NP34, NP22 were that good, why would china invest so much money and resources in designing a new handgun for themselves. i''m sure any rational person would agree that it is alot easier to just copy a good design and adopt.\n\nEconomics also play a very important role here. you''ll have to follow me for a while here. you see, when u copy and clone a good design to very letter and spirit (to the minutest of details and quality wise). the price difference diminishes. so its pointless to clone a good handgun if it will eventually cost you the same. sure some difference in price will remain, depending on the difference in labor and raw material costs. but that difference is negligible. therefore, the only way to make a clone and make money in the process is to sacrifice somewhere. that sacrifice could be in from of manufacturing quality/performance or looks. now think gentlemen, if a clone is designed while sacrificing on the looks, it would definitely be "adoption worthy" cause its a good design to begin with and it performs good too.

However as a 2-month old pup, very much like our own kids, they are mouthy and like to play and grab things in their mouths.\n\nIt should not be mistaken for biting, per se. However if it continues after another 1-2 months, you can use a sharp, harsh "NO" each time the puppy shows unacceptable behaviour and remove any pleasurable experience/object. Please remember not to "hit" the pup/dog with anything at all. Dogs do not discipline their young by hitting or throwing things at them or kicking them; they grab, bite and overpower them! In order to train or mould (is that the right spelling?!) ur pup, u need to behave in the way and use the body language that he understands, not what we use :)\n\nSo, if you MUST use negative physical reinforcement, first of all subdue your anger at being bitten (this is not about revenge, but discipline) and grab a handful of scruff (the loose skin right behind the head) and give the pup a shake or two, while growling NO!\nDon''t overdo it, the objective is to make the puppy feel helpless and show him who the boss is, not hurt him :)\n\nI hope it helps.', 1, 1, '202.154.246.117', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I''m moving back to the states this summer and wanted to buy a few items, but I keep having this feeling that I''ll be subjected to unnecessary and extra background checks (or worse) because I''m of Pakistani heritage (read brown skinned) and a Muslim.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nNot at all! Background checks only take a few minutes at most, and I''ve never been delayed or anything. I''ve heard of other people (non eastern/Muslim) getting delayed because the feds get their identity mixed up with other people. I''ve never even been stopped at an airport either, but did get stopped for a random search on the border driving into Canada of all places :crazy:\n\nAs for unnecessary or extra background checks, there is only one, the "NICS" (National Instant Criminal Background Check), where you fill out a form called the 4473. You fill this out if you buy a gun from a store.  Here is a PDF document of the form. You only have to fill out the first page, the dealer fills out the rest. \n[URL="http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf"]\nhttp://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf[/URL]\n\n\nHowever, if you decide to buy a gun from a person rather than a store, you don''t have to do a background check. Just give them the money and they give you the gun. This is legal, by the way. A seller might ask you to write down some information for record, but most people don''t care and are not legally obligated to do so. \n\nWhat state are you moving to? The laws vary greatly by state.

I was as excited as you, when I came across this forum over a year ago when I was doing abit of online research on Zastava M57, after purchasing a couple of them. One reason for my excitement was that since my very young age I''ve had a natural love for guns but back where I spent ma childhood, according to my elders if you had an interest in guns or Fire Arms, sadly you were labelled as some one bad, some one with negative or anti-social interests and someone with no interest in education or academics, which I strongly disagreed with but sadly being so Young and alone (in terms of interest) there was not much I could do to fight or argue my case.\n\n I am glade finally there is now a forum (from Pakistan) where civilised, law abiding decent Pakistani and other citizens can express and share their common interests and opinions in fire arms, sports shooting, hunting, and other leisure and re-creational activities. Alhumdulillah academically I did well and now with the grace of Allah I''ve a very decent job like the majority of PG Friends from all types of different fields and backgrounds, so I hope this proves the point to them like it has to the many globally that not every man with a gun is a Criminals, if not I dont really care what ppl think now. I''ve learnt alot and gained alot of knowledge from reading different threads shared by fellow PG''s during the last year and so, I probaby wouldn''t have been able to gain this much in my entire life else where. Its been a great help. If it wasnt for the help and knowledge from PG I would''t have been ble to make the right choices for myself, brothers and other friends. Now sometimes friends and relatives consult me when they feel the need to shop, which I am more than happy to help with, however I am just a learner like the rest.\n\nlooking forward to hearing from you more and hope you ur stay here[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks :) Gun forums are a great way to learn and meet people with common interests, AKA range buddies haha.\n\n[QUOTE=MK47;350025]Sorry I know the question was intended for Imran, but being in the same boat as you two living abroad but just in a different Country, Yes the chances are that will likely be the case. Its often the same here aswell, If you apply for sensitive jobs for example at the Airports, in the Aviation Industry or for a Shotgun/ Rifle License (Handguns are banned in the UK, only Shotgun and other Bolt Rifles etc Licenses are allowed), You are more likely to be grilled with extra questions and most likely will be subjected to extreme background/ History checks etc. Thats probably the main reason I''ve never bothered applying for a Shotgun License here, because every month you get a random visit by the authorities, they check your gun safe to make sure everything is where it is supposed to be kept, and even ask you certain questions like how many rounds have you fired since the last visit etc.\n\nBut don''t worry about all that because despite all that as long as your previous record is clean and you fulfill the required legal/documentational criteria it should be ok and You will get what you intend to get. The only difference is they might ask you afew more questions and carry out afew extra checks. Let them. who cares.[/QUOTE]\n\nSorry to hear about the state of the UK''s gun laws.

I''ve never even been stopped at an airport either, but did get stopped for a random search on the border driving into Canada of all places :crazy:\n\nAs for unnecessary or extra background checks, there is only one, the "NICS" (National Instant Criminal Background Check), where you fill out a form called the 4473.

Hence, they''re equally fragile, theoretically.\n\nIf they don''t come forth and explain the difference, they''re both pieces of crap to us. And if they do mention any difference, they''d be bound to explain as to why the C model was weaker built than the F!!\n\nBro, we''re passengers of the same bandwagon, the results in front of me contradict nothing of whatever I said about the C model, since my impressions were always limited to the technical performance only of the handgun, not it''s built/durability part, which both only time can prove of new handguns.\n\nYes, the results are in front of us now and Caracal need to come forth and explain this incidence and what they intend to change within the manufacture processes before replacements?\n\nAs far as the "isolated incidence" is concerned, I meant to say that this could be concluded as well if we send in an F model or another C model. That is, if Caracal keep insisting that this was an "isolated" incidence.\n\nIf the  metallurgy hardness of another model sent in - c or f, preferably F - appears the same as the C model tested, it will prove that it''s [B]not[/B] an isolated incidence.\n\nI believe I managed to explain better now.

In North America, it is common practice for everything to be in writing. That way, a customer knows the price is the price... and not "the price for him" because he seems less experienced, or because the shop owner doesn''t like him, or because he''s a newbie, ect. If you don''t like it, you can walk out, if you can''t afford it, you can look at something else. It saves everyone time, suspicion, and headache. \n\nRegarding copies (what we like to call "replicas"), we get them as well, in the form of Taurus, and mostly Norincos. The justification for buying those guns is, you pay less and sacrifice some finishing, but gain exceptional robustness and reliability, as you are familiar is the case with Chinese guns. However it seems your local gunsmiths can make a gun look absolutely perfect, but seldom do they work perfectly, at least not for extended periods of time. Otherwise, you would have some extremely desirable firearms on your hands! So, I''m curious as to what exactly is the cause of these performance issues? Since major manufacturers have production tolerances of less than a thousandth of an inch, has anyone ever taken a micrometer and compared the parts dimensions of, for example, a Glock and a Clock?

Without the hammer, they also have the advantage of being more "de-horned"(smooth profile) by default, which is extremely important for a gun being concealed behind clothing. It is amazing the ways you can get caught up when you have to quick draw from concealed retention in a sd situation. A final advantage with striker fired is the consistent trigger pull, which means no stiff and long double action first shot, to a short and light single action second shot. Again, in an sd situation, the first two shots are the most important. That''s why all the new pistols like Springfield Armory XD and XDm, Smith & Wesson M and P serires, Glock Gen4, FN Five Seven are striker fired.

Its features and merits are  numerous.The following are the salient ones:\n1. It is water proof,  scratch proof, shock proof. You can leave it out of the tent under the  open sky in a cold wintry night or even if it is raining.  \n2. It is  also useful for hitting bushes to force the bird to fly, or for making  one''s way forward in thick bushes and shrubs, especially in Belas. \n3.  No need for cleansing, applying oil, or pulling a cloth in barrels  after firing. It is internally lubricated by the manufacturer for life  time. In 15 years, it has never tasted oil or lubricants etc. \n4.  Even if not loaded with cartridges, it is a useful tool for safety, as  it can be used to hit dangerous animals like pigs on the head if they  turn round at you. For this purpose it is also useful to pull down  robbers if they come unexpectedly in you way. \nThere are still many  many more qualities in my ZIMADAR.

I mean the man refused to take even a sip of water even up to his dying breath!!\r\n\r\n\r\n[url]http://tribune.com.pk/story/486425/rail[/url] ... f-his-own/\r\n\r\nThe train was 10 minutes late but not Sohail Mehmood. As the Super Express pulled into the Landhi railway station, he saw a small boy crossing the tracks unaware of the approaching danger. Without giving it a second thought, Sohail dashed toward the kid, pushing him off the track. The child was badly hurt but alive. Sohail was not so lucky himself.\r\n\r\nAt 9:35am on August 7, families at the Landhi railway station held on to their luggage – and children – as the train made its way to platform No. 1. But for six-year-old Aminullah, who had come to Karachi from Thatta just to spend a few days with his grandfather, this was a playground.\r\n\r\n“The boy was playing with some other kids at the platform when the incident took place,” recalled his 62-year-old grandfather Javed Hussain. He lives in Daud Chali just beside the railway station.\r\n\r\n“Aminullah was saved by a God-fearing man but he has not come out of the shock so far,” said Hussain. “He frequently fights with his brothers and bites them too.”\r\n\r\nSecond among four brothers, Aminullah was badly hurt on the head and the back when Sohail pushed him between the railway tracks and the platform. While he was saved, the 38-year-old railways police constable was caught under the engine’s buffer and was dragged on until the train came to a stop.\r\n\r\n“He saw the train coming,” said a vendor, Syed Mohsin Shah, a witness to the perilous jump. “He didn’t care and jumped to save the child.”\r\n\r\n“The child was bleeding and trembling but alive,” said the assistant station master at Landhi, Naseem Ahmed.\r\n\r\n“Although Sohail was offered water once he was pulled out from under the locomotive, he refused to take a sip as he was fasting,” said Landhi railways police station SHO, Muhammad Saleem. “He died shortly after.”\r\n\r\nWhile\r\n\r\nThe father of four, with the youngest only six months old, Sohail joined the Railways police in 2001. Since then, he had saved a lady from an approaching train at Cantt station and another man at some other place, Sohail’s elder brother, Faiq Mehmood, told The Express Tribune.\r\n\r\n“He was distressed for more than two months when he couldn’t save a mentally challenged man who was run over by a train,” recalled Faiq. “Sohail should be awarded a Sitara-e-Jurat for his bravery.”\r\n\r\nThe Karachi Metropolitan Corporation administrator had announced a reward of Rs500,000 for the victim’s family, but Faiq said the family has yet to receive a single paisa. While his spokesperson claimed the “relevant department” was looking into the matter, Muhammad Hussain Syed could not be reached for comment.\r\n\r\n“We are proud of Sohail. His sacrifice has lifted the morale of the Railways police,” said Railways SSP Arshad Kamal Kiyani. The Pakistan Railways inspector general, Syed Ibn-e-Hussain, has approved the recommended “Tamgha-e-Shujat” for Sohail, which would be complimented with a reward of Rs500,000 for the bereaved family. Defence Saving Certificates worth Rs1,200,000 were awarded to Sohail’s widow while Rs300,000 each would be given by the Railways Police and Pakistan Railways, Kiyani said.\r\n\r\nThe railways cop, who saved Aminullah’s life at the cost of his own, was laid to rest with full state honours in the Zafar Town graveyard.\r\n\r\nPublished in The Express Tribune, December 30th, 2012.', 1, 1, '119.155.8.103', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Not to buy it in the first place.  But if u absolutely must. Then go for a design that has been around for some time. Say the berreta 92 fs. After the tt its the most copied ddesign. An original Zafar Alam should be nice. However even Zafar''s products are being cloned. kind of like clones of clones. \n\nOther then that the weapon that u have yourself. its a sturdy design if made by a good gunsmith and finaly the Taurus PT 92. That the range master at ASCC GC has used and rates well (Around 1000 rounds life.. About all that''s expected from a clone) \n\nMy personal favourite is the Taurus 909 cause it looks so darned good!\n\nNO striker fired polymer offerings regardless of how they look!! \n\nEven reputed brands like Caracal and sigma have problems emulating the Glock design. I shudder to think what our local mistries will do with plastic parts and strikers...  Remember the chances are remote that they have access to weapons grade polymer....

I mean proper sd training. In no way am I trying to be discouraging, but there''s a lot of b.s. out there, like catchy phrases about carrying a gun, and slogans about defending oneself (just reading people''s signatures in the forums makes me shake my head sometimes-no offense to anyone here) yet no matter how many videos you watch, how many posts you read, how many times you go through it in your head, it will not prepare you IF that moment comes. Another thing I''d like to touch on, and admittedly I know nothing about the Pakistani legal system, but where I''m from it doesn''t matter if you''re 200% justified, 99.999 times out of 100 you will have to defend yourself in court (at your own expense) after you shoot someone. If you are shooting in a sd scenario, you are shooting to kill, and like Nazim Bro said, it is not done as easily as said. Taking a life is not something that is easy to live with. I know i live on the other side of the world and I''m not Pakistani, but we''re all human. Once again, I''m not trying to be discouraging at all, but just trying to offer you some food for thought based on my experience. Yes, it''s very scary being victimized, but when it comes to, guns it''s better to take things slow and one step at a time. You are brand new to guns, and there is nothing wrong with that as we all were at some time, but when you speak of carrying condition 1 (round in the chamber, cocked and locked) and drawing from concealed positions and ankle holsters, those are all very advanced techniques.

And if the weight was issue, they might have used polymer rod as they can make polymer frames and many manufacturers using polymer guides i.e. S&W, Barreta etc. or a hollow rod etc.\n\nhere is pic of CF 98 spring which I believe is recoil buffer.\n \n[URL="http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsTpum9"][IMG]http://s2.postimage.org/Tpum9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nand let me add one more thing, rear part is a moving part.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nI have a question regarding the moving part screw.

Hence, they''re equally fragile, theoretically.\n\nIf they don''t come forth and explain the difference, they''re both pieces of crap to us. And if they do mention any difference, they''d be bound to explain as to why the C model was weaker built than the F!!\n\nBro, we''re passengers of the same bandwagon, the results in front of me contradict nothing of whatever I said about the C model, since my impressions were always limited to the technical performance only of the handgun, not it''s built/durability part, which both only time can prove of new handguns.\n\nYes, the results are in front of us now and Caracal need to come forth and explain this incidence and what they intend to change within the manufacture processes before replacements?\n\nAs far as the "isolated incidence" is concerned, I meant to say that this could be concluded as well if we send in an F model or another C model. That is, if Caracal keep insisting that this was an "isolated" incidence.\n\nIf the  metallurgy hardness of another model sent in - c or f, preferably F - appears the same as the C model tested, it will prove that it''s [B]not[/B] an isolated incidence.\n\nI believe I managed to explain better now.

Remington chambered their rolling  block and Lee rifles for the 7mm about 1897, and later the Model 30. The  Winchester Model 54 and 70 also chambered it. Currently, the Ruger  Model 77 and Winchester Featherweight bolt action, plus the Ruger Number  One single shot offer the 7mm as standard among American-made rifles.  However, most British-and European-made bolt-action rifles and  combination guns chamber the 7mm Mauser, as do many custom-made rifles  each year.\n\nAlthough originally a military cartridge, the 7x57mm Mauser has proven  itself as one of the best all-around sporting rounds ever developed. It  is particularly useful in lightweight rifles because it delivers good  killing power with  moderate recoil. It has been used successfully on  every species of big game on earth, including elephant. However, it is  no elephant cartridge in the true sense of the term and its success is  due largely to the hunting conditions and ability of the hunters who  have used it. Ballistically, it is only less powerful than 270  Winchester or the 280 Remington. It is adequate for most American big  game, but is perhaps on the light side for Kodiak bear or moose unless  used by an experienced hunter. The 7mm Mauser was discontinued in  American-made rifles about 1940 due to lack of popularity. Since the end  of WWII, it has become increasingly common due to the influx of surplus  7mm military rifles for several years after the war. The wide selection  7mm bullets now available for hand-loading has also contributed to an  increase in popularity. 						\n[/INDENT]', 1, 1, '203.81.212.215', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Now they are left with few pieces and they are more interested in getting rid of those, instead of going back to company and wait for replacement / repayments.

The 44 Auto Mag in turn is made by cutting off 30-06 and 308 Winchester brass to a final length of 1.298-inch and inside reaming to accept a .429-inch diameter bullet. The first Auto Mag pistols were announced in 1970, but were not actually delivered until late in 1970. These were, of course, in 44-caliber and the 357 Auto Mag didn''t appear until 1973. For an extra $150 one could purchase both the 357 and 44 barrel and slide assembly units and convert the pistol to handle either caliber with relatively easy change of units. The 357 Auto Mag cartridge was never made commercially. However, the 44 case was made in Mexico for a time so that conversions of these to the smaller caliber can be encountered. The Auto Mag semi-auto pistols are not currently in production although there have been rumors that they may be manufactured again at some future date.\n\nThe 357 and 44 Auto Mag pistols were of stainless steel, had a 6 1/2-inch barrel. overall length of 11 1/2 inches and weighed 3.4 pounds.

The 243 was quickly  adopted by Savage for their Model99 lever- and Model 110 bolt-action  rifles. All or the British and European manufacturers began chambering  bolt-action rifles for this round, including BSA, FN, Sako, Husqvarna,  Mannlicher-Schoenauer and others. In fact, even Remington, who developed  their own 6mm, had to recognize the popularity of the 243 and start  chambering their rifles for it. The 243 (6mm) Winchester is nothing more  than the 308 Winchester case necked-down. Original development and  publicity was due largely to the efforts of gun writer, the late Warren  Page, who along with other wildcatters worked out a similar version  before Winchester. The 243 is probably chambered in more different  rifles than any other cartridge, except possibly the 308 Winchester.\nThe 243 Winchester represents a successful effort to develop a  varmint-to-deer class rifle that could hold its own with the various  high-velocity 22s for extremely long-range use on small targets and  still be adequate for the larger animals. The 243 does this job so well  that it has taken a lot of play away from the 222 Remington and all the  rest of the 22 cartridges. It eliminates the need to own two different  rifles for anything from small game and pests right up to and including  deer, antelope or black bear. The 80-grain bullet is intended primarily  for varmint and medium-sized game and the 100-grain bullet for deer  -size animals. The 257 Roberts and the 250-3000 Savage are supposed to  cover the same range and certainly do. However, the 25-caliber bullets  don''t have quite the sectional density for long-range varmint shooting  until bullet weights gets up around 120-grains, and then the velocity  falls off badly. All in all, the 6mm does a better job in covering the  intended range of game and shooting conditions.', 1, 1, '203.81.212.215', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In 1964, it was  officially adopted by the U.S. Army as the 5.56mm Ball cartridge Ma93.  It is used in the selective-fire M16 rifle, which is based on the  original AR-15 design. The cartridge was actually the work of Robert  Hutton, who was technical editor of GUNS & AMMO magazine and had a  rifle range i n Topanga Canyon, California. One of the requirements for  the cartridge was that the projectile have a retained velocity in excess  of the speed of sound (about 1080 fps at sea level) at 500 yards,  something you couldn''t get with the 222 Remington. Working with Gene  Stoner of Armalite, Bob Hutton developed a case slightly longer than the  222 and also had Sierra make a 55-grain boat-tail bullet. This  combination met the design requirements. All this was documented in the  1971 issue of the GUNS & AMMO ANNUAL. However, this author was not  aware of this and has stated in previous editions that he didn''t believe  that this information had ever been published. Originally an alternate  military cartridge, the 223 (5.56mm) is now the official U.S. and NATO  round, but we should note here that NATO forces, including the U.S.,  have standardizes a new 5.56mm round with a heavy bullet and the M193 is  no longer standard.\nShortly after the military adopted the cartridge, Remington brought out  the sporting version, which has largely replaced the 222 Remington  Magnum in popularity. Practically every manufacturer of bolt-action  rifles has at least one model chambered for the 223. In addition, there  are a large number of military-type semi-auto rifles available in this  caliber and at one time the Remington Model 760 slide-action was  available in 223.\n\nThe 223 is nearly identical to the 222 Remington Magnum, the only  difference being that the 223 has a slightly shorter case. The two are  not inter-changeable, although the 223 will chamber in a 222 Magnum  rifle. The result, though, is to create a gross head space problem, and  the 223 case will rupture if fired in the 222 Magnum chamber. The 223  has proven to be an effective military cartridge for fighting in jungle  or forested areas and for close-in fire support, and has been improved  lately by NATO with heavier bullets fired through fast-twist (1 in  7-inch) barrels. As a sporting round, it is just as accurate as any of  the other long-range, center-fire 22s. Military brass cases are usually  heavier than commercial cases and maximum loads should be reduced by at  least 10 percent and approached cautiously, because the reduced case  capacity results in a higher loading density and increased pressure with  the same powder charge. The 223 Remington can be classed as an  excellent medium-range varmint cartridge at ranges out to around 250  yards.\n\n[SIZE=5][B]EDITORIAL NOTE: In 1979, SAAMI cautioned shooters that 5.56mm military  chambers and throats differ from 223 sporting rifle chambers, and  therefore military ball ammo may produce high chamber pressures in  sporting rifles.

The Allion is beautiful vehicle, however, you have to keep in mind that its service and parts would be far more expensive when compared to a locally assembled Corolla which would be had for a lower price and would hold its value far better. Ofcourse, if these things are not a consideration then by all means go to the allion. \nBy the way, you have not mentioned the YEAR.

But with a Ferrari you know you''re safe out of the box.

The 30-06 is actually a  slightly-modified version of the original 1903 cartridge, which was  loadedwitha 220-grain round-nosed bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2300  fps. Because of cartridge developments in Europe, it was considered  advisable to change to a 150-grain bullet at an increased velocity of  2700 fps, and at the same time the case neck was shortened by 0.7-inch.  This improved round was designated the " Ball Cartridge, caliber 30,  Model of 1906" but in practice, nomenclature was shortened to 30-06. The  30-06 version can be chambered and fired in any rifle made for the  original 1903 round, but the reverse is not always true because of the  difference in case length. For many years both the 1903 and 1906  loadings and case configurations were loaded by sporting ammunition  manufacturers. Shooting the ''06 in the ''03 chamber reportedly gave poor  accuracy. Old catalogs list both rounds, and occasionally the 1903  version is called the 30-45 because the original loading used 45 grains  of smokeless powder.\nAgain, because of military developments in Europe, the Army switched to a  172-grain bullet with a 9-degree boat-tail in 1926, the new round being  designated the "Ball, caliber 30, M1." Muzzle velocity, originally the  same as the 150-grain load of 2700 fps, was later reduced to 2640  because of difficulty maintaining pressure specifications at the higher  velocity. In 1940, the 150-grain flat-base bullet was re-adopted as the  "Cartridge Ball, caliber 30, M2". The return to the lighter bullet came  about, at least in part, because of difficulties adopting the then-new  Garand semi-auto rifle to handle 172-grain loading.\nThe rimless 30-03 and the later 30-06 replaced the older rimmed 30-40  Krag as the official U.S. military round. The 30-06 has, in its turn,  been superseded by the 7.62mm M59, also known as the 7.62 NATO or, in  its commercial version 308 Winchester. As a sporting cartridge, the  30-06 is one of the most popular and widely-used big game numbers ever  developed.  In Europe it is known as 7.62x63mm. Every manufacturer of  standard length bolt-action sporting rifles in the western world  chambers the 30-06.\nThe Winchester Model 1895 lever-action appears to have been the first  sporting rfle chambered for the new 30-03. The cartridge was added to  the line of available calibers in 1904-1905, the modified 1906 round in  1908. The Remington bolt-action Model 30, introduced in 1921, and the  Winchester bolt-action Model 54 brought out in 1925 both offered the  30-06, among other calibers. The savage bolt-action Model 40 and 45  Super-Sporter rifles were also chambered when introduced in 1928. At  present, in addition to the many bolt-action rifles, the Remington Model  Six slide action and Four semi-auto, as well as the Browning and  Heckler & Koch semi-auto, include the 30-06 as standard calibers.  The Ruger Number One single shot rifle is also offered in 30-06.\n\nThe 30-06 is undoubtedly the most flexible, all-round big game cartridge  available to hunter. For many years it has been the standard by whch  all other big game cartridges have been measured. To say that a  cartridge is in the 30-06 class means it is suitable for any game in  North America. The secret of success when using this cartridge is to be  sure and select the right bullet for the game and hunting conditions at  hand. The lighter bullets of 100 to 130 grains be used only for varmint  hunting. While these bullets can be driven at impressive velocities,  starting out at over 3000 fps, they  are made to expand rapidly on small  animals and will not penetrate properly on large game. For deer,  antelope, goat, sheep, black or brown bear, under most hunting  conditions, the 150- or 165-grain bullet is proper. For heavier game  such as elk, moose or the big brown bear, the 180-,200- or 220-grain  bullet is the best choice. These are also considered best for woods or  brush hunting, regardless of the quarry. Many experienced hunters  consider the 180-grain bullet the most satisfactory all-round loading  for the 30-06 because it can be used effectively on anything from  deer-sized animals to the heaviest varieties under almost any hunting  conditions. When hand-loaded with the 250-grain bullet, the 30-06  practically duplicates the performance of the British 318 Rimless-Nitro,  popular in many parts of Africa for shooting plains game. As a matter  of fact, the 30-06 will give a good account on all but the heaviest or  most dangerous African or Asiatic species under average hunting  conditions. The 220-grain bullet is generally recommended for African  game although the 180-grain also has a good reputation there. With the  proper bullet, this cartridge can be adapted to any game or hunting  situation in North or South America, whether in the mountains, plains,  woods or jungles. 						\n[/INDENT]', 1, 1, '203.81.212.215', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

He headed \n for the country and stopped at a field that looked as though it could \n attract ducks. While walking through a field, several ducks flew \n overhead. He aimed, fired, and shot one of the ducks out of the sky. \n However, the duck landed on the other side of a large irrigation ditch \n with no signs of any nearby crossing. \n He briefly thought about leaving the duck but realized that the \n weather was becoming worse. Not wanting to return home empty handed, \n he decided to try and find some way across. About a quarter mile \n further ahead he found a crossing and, as he walked back along the \n other side, came across a farmer who was carrying his duck. \n "Excuse me?" he said, "I believe that''s my duck you''re carrying." \n "Oh I don''t think so," replied the farmer, "It landed on my property. \n This here''s my duck." \n They argued back and forth for a few minutes and then the farmer \n suggested a solution. \n "Let''s settle this the country way. We''ll take turns kicking each \n other in the balls and the first man to give in, gives up the duck." \n The hunter thought about it for a minute. At first he questioned the \n sanity of engaging in a "ball-kicking" contest but felt he was tough \n enough and accepted the challenge. \n "Alright then," Said the farmer, "I''ll go first." \n The hunter took a deep breath and prepared himself for the blow. The \n farmer reared back and kicked the hunter in the balls as hard as he \n could. The hunter moaned and dropped to the ground, rolling around in \n pain as he grasped his groin. After several minutes the hunter \n recovered to his feet, took several deep breaths and said, "Okay, now \n it''s my turn." \n The farmer looks at the hunter, shakes his head and says, "Oh, that''s \n okay, you can have you''re duck."

It was developed by B. Tyler Henry for the lever-action repeating rifle bearing his name, the forerunner of the first Winchester rifle. The Henry rifle was manufactured by the New Haven Arms Co. from 1860 to 1866, at which time it was recognised as the Winchester Repeating Arms Co. The 44 Henry cartridge was manufactured from 1860-61 to about 1934. There are two versions of the cartridge. The early case was .815-inch long. Bullet and powder charge were the same. Colt revolvers were also made in 44 Henry caliber. The Henry rifle and cartridge saw limited use in the Civil War.\n\nThe 44 Henry, although quite successful, was not a very powerful round. Hardly adequate for deer-size animals and certainly no match for buffalo or grizzly bear, its principal advantage was in the 15-shot repeating rifle. This provided an undreamed of firepower, something that could be decisive in combat. In recognition of this fact, Winchester brought out an improved rifle and the 44-40 cartridge in 1873. From that date on, Winchester was in continuing competition with the makers of single shot rifles and their big powerful buffalo cartridges. The 44 Henry used a 200-grain bullet and 26-28 grains of black-powder.', 1, 1, '203.81.212.215', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

One solution was to neck it up to 357-caliber so as to use larger diameter, heavier bullets and this was done in the initial powder capacity of the original 30 Harrett case and so the final design used a case length of 1.75 inches which is .15-inch longer than the 30 Harrett case. The development of the 357 Harrett was the work of Steve Herrett and gun writer Bob Milek. It was introduced as the standard caliber for the Thompson/Center pistol in 1974 or 1975. Cases are made by reforming, shortening, and necking-up 30-30 or 32 Winchester Special brass. The case has a 30-degree shoulder angle, and after forming, the cases are fire formed to the final configuration.\n\nThe 357 Herrett is another example of a wildcat cartridge developed for a specific weapon and purpose where there is a gap in the commercial line of ammunition. It was intended primarily as a hunting cartridge for the heavier varieties of big game, however, it has also become quite popular among silhouette shooters. It does very well for both purposes, but one must bear in mind that as a big game cartridge it delivers ballistics inferior to the 35 Remington fired from a rifle. While it is perfectly capable of handling large animals under average conditions, much depends of the skill of the user, something that is true of all handguns and handgun cartridges when used on big game. The 357 Herett is, nevertheless, one of the best of the handgun cartridges for field use on large or small game. When fired from 14-inch barrel of a Thompson/Center pistol, 110-grain bullet loaded over 28 grains of "2400" powder produces the muzzle velocity of 2600 fps and muzzle energy at 1650 fpe, on the other side, a 180-grain bullet with 32 grains of "N200" powder reduces the muzzle velocity to 2125 fps but gains on muzzle energy which increases to 1808 fpe.', 1, 1, '203.81.212.215', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I would like the admins to kindly explain me why they are doing this. Do you have an issue with IDPA that I do not know about. I am a strong believer that politics should stay away from sports and I, very humbly, would request you too. I have been a member of IDPA since 2002 and I have always promoted IDPA, be it Kenya, Canada or Pakistan. Currently I am the vice president of Stittsville Defensive Pistol Association. I have recently registered a club called IDPA Pakistan to promote this discipline in Pakistan. I believe in everybody pooling in resources to make things happen. I do not believe in upsetting people to gain higher positions. I am a humble person and give my very best to IDPA and I am open to all friends who would like to be a part of this.\nI would like to request the admins of this forum to kindly allow me to use their amazing platform to promote IDPA. I am least bothered with positions in the club, I reside in Canada. I truly want people to enjoy IDPA and I am looking for some partners to help me run it as per the guidelines of IDPA. \nI hope one of the admins in this forum will be kind enough to contact me in regards to this matter. \nI am most certainly open to suggestions, advices and guidance, if you have any for me. I do not know the local politics, and quite frankly, I will stay away from it.[/quote]', 1, 0, '182.185.186.35', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Browning for Belgian  company Fabrique Nationale (FN), Herstal. Model 1910 had been developed  around two cartridges, also designed by Browning - the 7.65mm Browning,  also known as .32ACP, which had been developed around 1900 for FN /  Browning model 1900 pistol, and the 9mm Browning Short (9x17mm), also  known as .380ACP, which, in turn, had been developed about 1908 for Colt  / Browning model 1908 pistol.\n  	In 1922, Browning modified the original pistol to suit requirements of  the Jugoslavian military - he lenghtened barrel, enlarged the grip and  magazine capacity by two rounds. The slide was lenghtened by adding  removable frontal portion to the model 1910 slide.\n  	Both models 1910 and 1922 were manufactured in large quantities until  1983 or so, when these guns were replaced by FN model 140DA / Browning  BDA380 pistols. In the USA both model 1910 and model 1922 were imported  under the name of "Browning 380 pistol", chambered in .380ACP. After the  1971, these guns have had ajustable target-type sights and slightly  enlarged grips to suit new US gun laws. Between two World Wars these  pistols became very popular across Europe as a police, military and  self-defence guns. It is well-known also that the First World War was  started by the Browning m1910 pistos, which had been used in 1914 to  assasinate the Archduke Ferdinand.\n  	Technically, both m 1910 and m 1922 (also known as model 1910/22), are  blowback operated semi-automatic pistols. The recoil spring is located  around the barrel, the trigger is of single action type and the gun is  striker-fired. Both models featured three safeties - magazine safety  (which blocks the firing when magazine is removed), automatic grip  safety and manual, frame mounted safety.\n\nHope you PG Brothers accept my two cents for this thread.\nRegards.\nAllah Bless.

I have had the pleasure of owning both the Vepr12 and Saiga 12 simultaneously. \n\n Fellow brothers here are right, Vepr12 is  more refined and it is also better looking of the two cousins. Also , Vepr is easier to load and you do not have to worry about ''gas tube'' settings.\n\nThat said and done, i ended up getting rid of my Vepr and keeping my Saiga. Keeping them both was not an option as i had to make one license free for a hunting weapon. This was for personal reasons being that 1- i use simple buckshot for my self defense and hence do not need to meddle with the gas tube settings ; and 2 - I had more options for hi-capacity magazines for Saiga and ended having 12 round magazines (about 50% more capacity than the 8 rounders?) with an eventual option of purchasing a 20 round drum magazine (when i can find them for a reasonable price).\n\n Needless to say, even now each time i look at a Vepr molot i want to reconsider my decision for keeping the Saiga. :)\n\nHaving used both weapons, Vepr and Saiga''s do not and SHOULD not give you the problems of FTF each time. To narrow down the problem to  the gas recycling system or the magazine, you may find the following exercise helpful.\n\na- point the weapon in a safe direction with adequate backstop (like at a range).\nb- Load up a magazine  and insert it in the weapon\nc- Manually pull the bolt ALL the way back and let go (do not push or anything, just let go completely so the bolt slams forward with its own spring force freely).\nd- If the round chambers, pull the bolt back quickly to eject the round from the chamber, keep it back all the way and then let go as in step ''c''.\ne- Do the above for all the rounds in the magazine till the magazine becomes empty.\nKindly ensure that at all times during this exercise that the weapon is constantly pointed in a safe direction.\n\nIf there are no loading issues this way, then the magazine is fine. the problem is probably the gas system of the Vepr which would need tuning up by an expert. If there are loading issues with the method above, then the problem may be feeding mechanism with the magazine being the most likely culprit.\n\nIf the problem is with the magazine, get a replacement magazine and try the above again. \n\nOn the last note, if i were you, i would kindly hand the weapon back to the dealer and i would tell him to keep it give me  a replacement Vepr OR my money back. Badar arms are quite reasonable but you would have to be persistent and call them almost every 2nd day.\n\nVeprs are more costly than Saigas.\n\nHope it helps and your issue is resolved.\n\nRegards', 1, 1, '115.186.122.52', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I used the common spray can lacquer (Rs. 125) as this being a smaller job (surface area wise). Using compressor & spray gun is a bit lengthy procedure but definitely gets better results even with lesser passes. With spray can i had to give 6 thin coats to avoid any dripping. The absolute final activity on the gun finish was a careful clear coat with the spray can. \n\n\n[QUOTE=AK47;352099]It seems to me you chose to expose the natural grains of the wood first and then did simple lacquering to laminate it.[/QUOTE]\nExactly. \n\nOnce the wood was exposed & dry from wet-sanding, it was given a hand rub with brown water color from kids'' stationary. \n\nThat color seeped in the dotty grain and enhanced the darker veins in the wood. \n\nOnce dry, it was [U]very mildly[/U] wet-sanded with 1000 grit paper to remove brown from flat light colored surface still leaving the dotted pinholes. \n\nOnce dry, it was given another hand rubbed massage with golden yellow water color again from the same arsenal. Wet-sanded with 1000 grit again.\n\nOne day to fully dry in shade & then lacquer...\n\nIts important to note, that both the colors that I rubbed were almost removed when wet-sanding leaving behind a very light (almost invisible) tinge that enhanced the impression of relevant surfaces once clear coat was applied.\n\n\n[QUOTE=AK47;352099]Did you use any wood sealer, and which?[/QUOTE]\n\nNo, nothing of that sort. The lacquer (having hardener in it) works as a wonderful sealer as well. Secondly it works great against scratches, dings, water & oil etc. Being designed for external automotive surfaces, it withstands all the abuse that is rendered to it.\n\n\n[QUOTE=AK47;352099]Finally, I was just thinking if at any time - during the project - you had considered matte finish lacquer as an option as well?[/QUOTE]\n\nI would have loved matte finish on plain base color. As the plan was to enhance natural wood grains & being fan of krieghoff''s effects & impressions, I decided on this finish.\n\nAnd unfortunately matte lacquer is not available in cans in our town.

Could you elaborate on how you added the extra receiver screw, and also the bedding process. Thanks in advance![/QUOTE]\n\nThank you brother for your kind words.\n\nThe most important part (for me) in adding the screw was to get the [B]correct length[/B] of the screw as the action base was closed in front of the nut & I didn''t want to pot a hole in there as bolt slides on the other side very closely.\n\nI found this old screw in my toolbox where I keep nut/bolts that are off from some vehicle or component as they are of way better quality than the ones available on our hardware stores. Secondly, most of them are having finer threads for precise tightening & more turns per millimeter.\n\nThe sequence goes like this:\nAfter physically calculating the available depths & space on both stock & action, I got the nut electric-welded where required [B]one spot at a time with wet cloth wrapped on the rest of the adjacent area and about 30 sec gap.[/B]\n\nMarked the area where nut was hitting the stock in action channel, drilled equivalent depth with a larger bit to accommodate the nut without touching sides. Same space was made on the bottom just behind the trigger guard.  \n\nA hole was drilled in the center of that pit for the screw to pass.\n\nAlHamdo Lillah it all went as a perfect fit without any corrections.\n\nI will post a link to the thread where bedding is done. That almost covers the process that I repeated this time. \n\n\n[QUOTE=Ka_Khan;352122]Welldone Lala TAREEN :)[/QUOTE]\n\nThank a lot Ka_Khan lala.

I''m sure after the bedding job the accuracy must have improved a lot. now there are a few things on my mind so brace yourself for some constructive criticism. :)\r\n\r\nwhy use lacquer? it feels plastic-like, it will turn opaque over time due to UV damage and in high heat it can turn into a sticky layer of glue. on top of all that, wood shrinks and expands over time, the lacquer being a less elastic surface will eventually peel off. here in my humble opinion, boiled linseed oil would have been better. it also hardens as it polymerizes but instead of forming a layer, it seeps into the wood first. you get all the benefits of a lacquer and sealer without sacrificing the natural feel of wood.\r\n\r\nI don''t know but avoiding a proper wood stainer has given the rifle the look of that cheap Chinese airgun mostly available at children toy stores. don''t get me wrong you know I have utmost respect for you. using a wood stainer (available at most hardware stores) to enhance the natural grains of the wood without revealing the open pores would have given better results.\r\n\r\nanyways, I like how you employed steaming technique to raise the dents.

In this instance, the designer did both by necking the case to accept .357-inch diameter bullets and lengthening it slightly to 1.563 inches. This is the largest caliber to date based on the 308x1.5-inch case and has a relatively small but sharp shoulder. This is about as far as one can go in expanding the shoulder. This is about as far as one can go in expanding the case neck and still have a shoulder left.\nInitial development and testing was with a Remington XP-100 bolt-action pistol with a 12-inch barrel. Hercules Reloader#7 gave the best performance in the testing thus far. Fifty-yard groups of 1mtov1 m1/2minches were common, but Lee Forsberg is working to bring this down to minute-of angle accuracy.\n\nForsberg is practically unknown to the metallic silhouette circuit, but it is remarkably efficient cartridge delivers truly impressive performance from such a small case. A 220-grain bullet exiting the muzzle at 2190 fps and 2350 fpe (12-inch barrel) beats out the 35 Remington fired from the usual 20-inch carbine barrel. In fact, it is in much the pretty same class as the 375 Winchester with its much longer case. As a hunting cartridge the 357 Forsberg would be in the deer and black bear class and possibly larger game under proper conditions. As a silhouette cartridge , it certainly has the oomph to knock down the rams and pigs at extreme ranges. It is too early to assess the future of the 375 Forsberg because it has not been used widely enough to generate a following. However, it has the potential to make a first-class silhouette and field cartridge.

This should also have gone in the opening post ;-(.\n\nThough I mostly use both of my .22 rifles on bench, they are often used in varminting and that too during night time. While vehicle plays a pivotal role as source of lighting & rifle rest, sometime, trees trunks, dust, and debris gets into contact with the rifle when away from it and need a rest for slightly longer shots. \n\nI have experienced small dings & scratches on wooden stocks no matter how careful I am, and I hate to see a scratch or a ding on the gun like most. That lead me to buy a rifle in polymer stock earlier & I will change my WMR also as & when I find a WMR in polymer stock. \n\n[QUOTE=12GAUGE;352283]why use lacquer? it feels plastic-like, it will turn opaque over time due to UV damage and in high heat it can turn into a sticky layer of glue. on top of all that, wood shrinks and expands over time, the lacquer being a less elastic surface will eventually peel off. here in my humble opinion, boiled linseed oil would have been better. it also hardens as it polymerizes but instead of forming a layer, it seeps into the wood first. you get all the benefits of a lacquer and sealer without sacrificing the natural feel of wood.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=12GAUGE;352283]I don''t know but avoiding a proper wood stainer has given the rifle the look of that cheap Chinese airgun mostly available at children toy stores. don''t get me wrong you know I have utmost respect for you. using a wood stainer (available at most hardware stores) to enhance the natural grains of the wood without revealing the open pores would have given better results.[/QUOTE]\n\nThe is no question & argument about oils being the best application to enhance the looks & grain of the wood. I read about linseed oil application for two days as it was suggested by @PakistanFirst as well. It sure gets hard enough to provide a pretty scratch resistant surface but that process of applying-drying-reapplying... takes about 1 week to 2 months to get to the desired hardness & the finish. I neither have that much patience & time not the quality of wood grain & the value of gun was so much that I should have spent so much of an effort & energy on it.\n\nThe reason I used lacquer was for more than one good things about it. Actually you have pointed out all the aspects of it from different angles, so let me add my experience with it here.\n\nWood inherently is far lesser effected by thermo-dynamics with expansion & contraction being most important of them as compared to metals. So there is way less effect of temperature on wood''s expansion than that is of moisture. Moisture does effect woods expansion.\n\nHaving said that, auto grade lacquer that has premixed hardener can withstand direct sunlight for many hours daily & temperatures around 40 degrees (c) for roughly 3 years if applied unbaked. Application on heated surface in sun increases it life & if applied in heated chamber, it goes many folds.\n\nBeing aerosol with very thin composition, it penetrates deep into the wood closing down all pores & veins that might attract moisture otherwise making it almost perfectly sealed waterproof. I spray lacquer in barrel channel, trigger channel & butt plate base as well as these areas have way more tendency to absorb moisture as compared to a finished outer surface.  \n\n \n[QUOTE=12GAUGE;352283]anyways, I like how you employed steaming technique to raise the dents. I too did that once and learned that if you steam the whole wood you can also raise the fibers and then sand them down to get that "smooth as silk" or glass type surface we all love to fee/see on high end shotguns.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThank you so much on appreciating this part. It is a flawless and easiest way to get the job done.\n\nIn this whole process, what I achieved here was \n[LIST]\n[*]probably a much accurate rifle due to better fitting feature, proper action bedding & free floating barrel.\n[*]A way better looking rifle as compared to the factory finish\n[*]Much more resistant to scratches, dings & moisture\n[*]All of it in very short time & probably within Rs. 250 with a some of inspiration & lots of perspiration.\n[/LIST]', 1, 1, '110.39.2.198', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

My basic purpose to buy this gun was HD i bought combo model for occasional hunting. I fitted the 18inc barrel successfully. Then came the time to test it. I loaded 1 SG/LG cartridge in chamber, and 3 cartridges in tube. 1st fire went well. but on 2nd catridge, gun did not fire. I pulled the bolt and let it out of gun. 3rd cartridge fired and next cartridge loaded in chamber. but it also failed to fire. I changed the cartridges to Shaheen no. 8. Same thing happened. 1st cartridge fired but 2nd & 3rd failed to fire. 4th cartridge fired. then i pulled the magazine cutt off button and started loading single cartridge directly in to chamber and they were flying. The point to be noted here is that after every fire the next cartridge was in chamber and it failed to fire. I thoroughly checked. Im 100% sure that it was in chamber. there are no strike marks on primer.

So I opened up the illumination knob, checked the tube inside, fitted and O ring, tightened all the screws & re-assembled the knob. Re-mounted the scope from scratch, 1st shot landed 5 mildots low, so once again unmounted the scope, shuffled the rings, zeroed at 15 yards.\r\nnow all pellets are landing in 1 hole at 15 yards and sub 1 inch group at 40 yards. ALLAH ka shuker hai !!\r\n\r\nOnly downside is that I can''t use the illuminated reticle but the good thing is that I never had to use it anyways :D but still, its better to have something and don''t need it then to need it & not have it.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nI regret that you face such problems. As far as the scope is concerned, almost every scope dies on magnum Springer one day. \r\nThough your Hatson is more powerful than my soft tuned 54 which is giving around 790fps with 14.3 gr pellets.\r\n\r\nNow come to a technical point. Your gun is not recoilless. Hence all the double recoil is absorbed by the gun, scope and the shooters shoulders and hands. Thus the total recoil to scope alone is 1/5 as compared to Diana 54 because due to recoil less feature of 54 only the action takes the jolt and resultantly the scope is exposed to 5 Times more recoil than your gun.\r\n\r\nYou can try Braska scopes. Sometimes they survive much more than CPs. Also Hawk scopes are good option. Specially the Airmax series of Hawk.\r\n\r\nNow I come to the dieseling issue. It MUST not last so long. I am concerned about it. \r\n\r\nHow do you keep your gun at home? It must be kept in the position with barrel upwards and should never be put horizontally. If you keep it in the correct way, then the lube should not come in front of piston and hence there should be no dieseling.\r\n\r\nIf it still diesels, we can meet again and wash some of the internals with patrol instead of diesel. Then we would have to re assess it after using further 100 to 150 shots.\r\n\r\nKeep in touch, and Insha Allah the things will improve.\r\n\r\nAre you using one piece mount or two piece mount?

I am just a beginner :) I have never hunted myself wild boars in night. Rather I have hunted 1 boar so far and that too with a 7mm Rem Magnum in daytime and that cruel ammo did not gave chance to the boar to move :) \r\nBut Shotgun is recommended and is in use for night hunting of boars specially if you plan hunt on foot. Its risky and you should be having backup weapon ready with you in case of a FTF or FTE. Serious hunters take a .44 magnum type revolver ready in case of any such thing.\r\nAgain, SG is good :) You can use LG surely and you are right about the pellet size and its effective power is greater then SG. But I will not recommend using AAA for boars. A wounded boar is very dangerous to play with. Use SG or combination of SG/LG.\r\n\r\nThe reason I recommended SG is, that the difference between SG and LG is not too much. And SG is very effective for boar size animal. \r\nThis chart may help you in choosing shotshell.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac350/mig_gunner/12borecartidges_zps5bf9b5bb.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 0, '14.192.138.133', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I had been carrying it hot status until the US recall over trigger issues, yet the local incidence was the straw that broke the Arab camel''s back for indefinite period of resolve.\n\nSome frequent and very joyful communion with respected Skeeter Sir recently and with his candid lectures, finally brought me to the conclusion that the best handgun that could possibly be trusted on for critical defense with a live round in the barrel and with the light carry-able weight load, would be the Glock, either the 17 or the 19.\n \nWhat I needed to know more about the Glocks in the market these days was learnt by respected member Gunfreak bro from Karachi who candidly gave the right guidelines and was a very cooperative fellow to interact with over the phone. My thanks to him, though he was more in favor of the G-26 which was also available to me at just around the same price, in Gen 4 even.[SIZE=5] [B]Special thanks to [COLOR=#ff0000]GUNFREAK [/COLOR]bro![/B][/SIZE]\n\nHence, landed the 3rd gen Glock 19[B] NPv[/B], [B]production dated 2012[/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GlockBoxopen.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWhen choosing, I had the option of picking up a Gen 4 G-17 at the same price, but on careful examination found that my smaller hands would be controlling the G-19 much better during use, and after playing around with both for some 15 minutes, I realized that the thumb rule of taking a feel of any new proposed handgun in your bare hands is the best golden selector mechanism. The[I] time tested[/I] Gen 3 selection was already pre-decided, since I was not interested in the Gen 4, anyways.\n\nSome more pics:\n\n[B]Glock 19[/B],[B][COLOR=#ff0000] [SIZE=4][I]The King CCW[/I][/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GlockCZSig/a755baa7-351e-462e-b60d-3782b8e0cc1f.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/GlockCZSig/f0969be8-45b0-4214-8f71-69e6d8e8bcc5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[SIZE=5][B]There''s a helpful link to verify the production dates of Glocks online, just in case you do not have the alphabetical codes handy with you:\n[/B][/SIZE]\n[B][URL="http://www.mujglock.com/en/glock-production-date.html?kod=ZOH"][COLOR=#0000cd]Production date of your GLOCK - MujGLOCK.com[/COLOR][/URL][/B]\n\nI''ll back on the Glock after field stripping it to show the kind of copper grease you should expect on an unused weapon. Also, there''ll course be a full fledged firing review as soon as I return in a couple of weeks.\n\nAll, I can say about the Glock so far is that next to my 1911, it was the 1.st handgun that my better half kept trying out in her hands and fell in love with to the extent that she insisted on 1 more in the house and for herself, probably the G-26.

I checked out the Sig Scorpion over the net, if one could lay one''s greedy hands upon it, but I was not really satisfied about the vulnerability of it''s dark earth finish for any regular use. The DW Valor is a fine option too, yet I am still to hear from somebody if they came back from the range with hands painless.

Shall fit a new bushing as well, then see how the barrel locks up etc. Once I have that fitted, then I shall shoot it and assess the situation, the trigger is not very crisp, but I can live with it.[QUOTE=Fudgepacker;352280]Dodo, the M93 Woodsman is worth getting 2 of... I did :) Mainly because it only came with 1 mag, and to get another was like $40, so it was like might as well get another gun for a hundred bucks!\nAlso, the USP is WAY over rated IMO. Wouldn''t pay that much for any "plastic" gun. I''d sleep on it for a while, maybe rent one at the range couple more times. I had one, and was like heck, could have a G22 AND an XD instead... so, sold it and did just that. You want a quality, accurate, 9mm, combat handgun that isn''t a glock and is famous for fitting like a glove, check out the CZ 75 SP01 Shadow. Or the Phantom if you prefer polymer. Worth every penny and then some!\n\nAlso, could you elaborate on your plans with the 1911. Norcs usually come from the factory pretty tight.

I understand the loading and racking the slide part being difficult. The best bet is to get her to practice with the DW as much as possible, e.g. give her a 4 inch circle to shoot at 10 feet, once she is able to shoot it every time, set it at 15 feet and so on. Very important to do load and fire and reload and fire drills. A woman here in Canada killed a Grizzly with a 22 lr, when it attacked her, shot it right in the eye. Also stopping power depends on the type of bullet used. If one is entirely comfortable with their firearm, then caliber is not a huge issue, bullet placement is the thing that matters most. With any rimfire, I would do drills to deal with misfires quickly.[QUOTE=Saad Moin;353567]In pistols I have a good variety, but this revolver is specifically for my wife to use. For her loading bullets in magazine and cocking the gun are very difficult jobs. A month ago, 4 people tried to enter our house.

Because it is very easy to load and fire a revolver, I want to go for it.\n\nAlso .22 mag JHP low recoil and stopping power almost equal to .38 special made me think to go for it.

I understand the loading and racking the slide part being difficult. The best bet is to get her to practice with the DW as much as possible, e.g. give her a 4 inch circle to shoot at 10 feet, once she is able to shoot it every time, set it at 15 feet and so on.

I am not familiar with DW revolvers, but if they''re anything like their 1911''s it should be a quality gun. A lot of people underestimate the capability of the 22lr, which has been proven time and again to be very lethal. So, with a 22 wmr you have nothing to worry about. In fact, you now have the advantage of better shot placement, since I have not met a person who does not have an easier time being accurate with a 22 than with any other caliber. With regards to those who make the argument about misfires and rimfires, I have not had any problems after shooting about 3000 rds of 22wmr.

But for civilian i discourage it. why? basically at the end of day he would be spending like approx 5 lac with lic and all... :O \n \nIt shoots exactly like standard platform. 410 is bit trouble with some cartridges. but 5.56 like  cream. .22 lr haven''t tried but i think ammo sensitive issue will come.', 1, 1, '69.31.101.124', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I still do remember however that my shots would land mostly to the right and up. I suppose this got to do with fine tuning yourself and your grip according to how the gun behaves.\n\nMoreover, my hands are smaller and the grip of Stoeger is pretty thick. \n\nI''d not suggest small handed shooters too thick a grip.  \n\nMy best assessment of the Stoeger was it''s incredible reliability. This handgun would just take anything fed and with no hiccups whatsoever. And my second attraction to it was it''s smooth, very easy field strip.\n\nI personally find myself uneasy with sub 4 inch barrels, reason why 3 of my handguns, Stoeger, CZ Rami and PT 145 had to vacate my closet.\n\nStoeger is not for the one wishing a range gun. For SD, even drunk men can hit a torso from 7-10 feet.\n\nFinally, as regards your .45 ACP aspirations, I feel this has nothing to do with keeping or releasing a 9mm Stoeger. This could be any handgun.\n\nOh yeah, let me assure you, a shot from a 1911 barrel for sure will hit better than a Stoeger''s.\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.188.149.216', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

They delivered their power at low revs, so when inching slowly forward over rough terrain there is no need to keep revving the engine to get the vehicle to move properly.\n\nAlso, these diesels were very high compression engines, which again is a benefit for off roading as it means when going down hill in low gears, with the foot off the accelerator, the engine works as a break and holds the vehicle back and at a sensible speed. This means very little use of the normal foot break is required, which avoids it burning/or wearing out on long descents.\n\nThese older diesels were also very reliable and lasted a long time. The needed very few electrics and no computers.  There down side is that the tended use a lot of fuel and could be noisy and dirty. They were not so good for long trips on  good roads.\n\nModern diesels are nearly the opposite and are very similar to petrol engines. They tend to be smaller with some pick-ups now coming with 2L turbo diesels. They are much more fuel efficient but they are designed always to be run at high revs (similar to a petrol engine) so they are not so easy to control when going very slow off road. They also rely on lots of electrics and computers to run them, again like a modern petrol engine..Because they run at high revs, they also do not last as long and tend not to be as reliable as the old engines and also need more specialized mechanics to work on them.\n\nThere is a compromise though and they are the engines like the older 2.8L diesels found in the Toyota Hilux, the Isuzu Trooper,  and the Diahatsu Fourtrack . These tended to combine the best of both worlds and offer decent fuel efficiency and reasonable power at low revs. They stopped using these in new vehicles in the UK and Europe though as they don''t meet the latest standards for exhaust emissions ie they are still too dirty. These engines were well suited to medium sized 4x4''s but were not really powerful enough for the very big Land Cruisers or big Nissan Patrols. Mercedes also made very good diesel engines like this such as the ones found in the old Merc taxis you see around the world..\n\nPeugeot are another company that made good basic diesels in the 1.8L, 1.9L and 2.2L class. They are very well suited to putting into the smaller Suzuki Jeeps such as the SJ413, although it does involve a lot of work...', 1, 0, '81.156.209.115', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

So i got this safir, which is built in exact same platform. and i researched that it could be converted to any type. i didnt have to pay, the delivery charges nor any hassles as i asked a close relative PAF officer to purchase it in US as he was on training there, on his aircraft, a barrel and even semi handguns have no trouble, so i collected it from chaklala airbase. My total package costed me 275k if i calculate that way... even less :P\n\nSo question is? is it worth it? for me yes, i can sell it for much much higher price...

However, the more  authentic of the two opinions is that it is Halal (lawful), because the  original ruling concerning eating animals is lawfulness, and only things  that are mentioned in Shari`ah (Islamic law) are prohibited. There is  nothing in the Shari`ah that indicates the prohibition of this animal.  In addition, it is a herbivore like rabbits and deer, not a carnivore,  so there is no reason for prohibiting it. The mentioned animal is a kind  of hedgehog with a coat of sharp spines. Ibn `Umar (may Allah be  pleased with him) was asked about eating hedgehogs, so he recited  Allah''s saying (Exalted be He),[B][COLOR=Blue] Say (O  Muhammad &#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;): "I find not in that which has been  revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat  it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by  slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork)[/COLOR][/B] [Surah Al An`am 6:145]\n(Part No. 23; Page No. 36)\nAn old man said, Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, [B][COLOR=Blue]It is one of the noxious animals[/COLOR][/B]. Ibn `Umar said, "If the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had said this, it is true, then."[Related by Ahmad]\nThis indicates that he (may Allah be pleased with him) had no idea  whether the Messenger of Allah had said anything about a hedgehog. It is  also clear that he did not believe the mentioned old man. This Hadith  was ranked as Da`if (weak) by Al-Bayhaqy and other scholars due to  anonymity of this man. Thus, it is concluded that its lawfulness is true  and its prohibition is a weak opinion. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be  He) knows best.\n\n[B][U]Footnotes:[/U][/B]\n\n[1] This was published in the book entitled, "Fatawa Islamiyyah",  compiled by Shaykh Muhammad Al-Musnad, vol. 3, p. 389; and the magazine  of the Islamic University in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah.[/QUOTE]\n+1 brother.

This is the Italian VB Practical in 9mm.  I saw it at Sheikh Salim Ali in Lahore store over 12 years ago, it was well over priced at that time... for that time; I believe that it was for sale for about 360K/rs then.  I couldn''t afford it.  I knew what it was as I had been familiar with VB pistols for sometime.  I used to own their model USA and another 9mm about 20 years back.  My how time flies but you never forget the good moments.\nThree weeks ago, a friend from Karachi, who bought this weapon 7 years ago called me to tell me that he was selling his Kimber (another gun that I was supposed to buy but he got to it first).  I told him to forget about the Kimber and to show me something that I may like... he asked and I told him.  Initially he laughed but like I always say... ''there IS a right price for EVERYTHING in this world... EVERYTHING'' - when I got done - he couldn''t say no anymore.  I got the firearm dropped off to me on Saturday morning.\nIt was not used but the years of taking it out of box and putting back in and playing with it - some of the corners had lost some bluing.  There were NO signs of firing as the barrel showed no signs of finish wear.\nNormally when I buy something, I disassemble and then clean and then put back together and then fire it; however, in this case I couldn''t wait.  I just lubed the slide and went to the range.  Today was a tiring day, fired airpistol after three weeks, then fired my Ruger Single Six, and lastly fired the VB.  I was tired by that time but still managed two 15 round strings of single handed fire at 25 meters... I didn''t adjust the sights... I only improvised.  Well, low and behold the results are there as proof.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/IMG_1511-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/IMG_1509-1.jpg[/IMG]\nI did a set on the plates however the guy recording seemed to be zooming everywhere except where I was shooting so that was a no show.\nI got home and then slowly stripped the gun, hey, I am gonna take care of it like it did me first time out.\nI lovingly took it all apart and began to see what was the charm.  This gun is a hybrid... lower matches the Beretta 92 CC and the barrel lug system matches the Sig P210.  The trigger is fully adjustable for pre and post.  The barrel with the compensator removed still get the accuracy from the slide bushing... something the engineers forgot to do on the CZ Czechmate.  The beavertail on this gun is removable.  There are pre drilled holes for the scope mount.  The rear sight is adjustable and has a clear view.  The levers are large and very elegant.\nI have found a new love for this family of guns... if the Germans make Mercs, Porsches, and such - then welcome to the world of Ferrari and Lamborghini... lolz.  Those plates ARE gonna beg me to stop shooting them.  Below are the pics, I took them BEFORE the cleaning.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/efe57dd8-9a0b-4b96-9a03-0dcbe88fdf0a.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/fdc10819-668d-48f2-b596-7b66aa55a8a1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/536713fc-d6f8-4e37-a54a-1bc19a6dc48c.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/c98dfe10-3fbe-4396-bfa0-339d5489c11e.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/b144a850-a1b9-44f0-8eee-f1e8f0bb0fd1.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '115.186.153.91', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Prhaps most of you dont know, but I''m a well preserved relic of the past. over the years, starting 30 years ago to be precise, I have had a fair number of airguns pass through my hands. The first was an underlever, tap loading BSA, a pre World War 1 model. It was my paternal grandfather''s gun and he wasn''t its first owner. It was the family airgun from which my grandfather and all his brother''s started their hunting career. Anyways, it was a good gun, better than most Pak made airguns of the 1980s. In 1986, I got a BSA Meteor, with which must have shot over a few thousand birds if not more. In 1997, I got myself a few more airguns - an HW80, an HW30, an HW45 and  BSA Supersport. The Supersport soon found a new home. \n\nThe HW80 is a great gun. I have had mine for about 16 years now and it still packs quite a punch. It is a difficult gun to shoot accurately at first as it is quite hold sensitive, and pellets sensitive too. I have tried a variety of pellets through it and the most accurate ones so far have been H&N Barracuda Match, which are over 20 grains each. \n\nThe HW30 is a regular workhorse. Its a small, and accurate little gun, and what it lacks in MV one can make up in good shot placement. It works the best with RWS Superdome pellets which weigh about 7.9 grains if I am not incorrect. \n\nI have changed the HW30''s mainspring and seals twice. The first time I dropped in genuine seals (breech and piston) but a Jim Maccari spring, spring-guide and spring tar. That made a world of difference. The HW30 felt like a totally different gun. Not much more powerful, but certainly much more accurate and consistently so. It also had a smoother cocking movement. \nWhen  the second change was due, Mr. Maccari was nowhere to be found online and when he was finally located he didnt answer any emails, so I had to use the factory replacements (sourced from Al-Sayad in Dubai).\n\nIn 2011 I acquired another HW30 in a rather beat up state. This gun needed new seals as the previous owner had liberally squeezed copious amounts of sewing machine oil into every orifice which that gun had. I managed to get a new piston seal from Dubai, but not a breech seal. So I went to shop that sells hydraulic equipment parts and got O-rings (Japanese) of the same inner dia and outer and the as the breech. Next I pulled out the old breech seal and put it one O-ring, but that sat very low in the groove, and wasnt sealing at all, so I popped in the other one too, and viola, it worked!\n\nIn my humble opinion, and bitter experience, accuracy is a lot more desirable than power. I have spent a lot money getting Ox mainsprings and Titan mainsprings and what not, and still have at least eight springs lying somewhere. \n\nIf you want good results, read the owner''s manual of your gun carefully and follow it. Work on your shooting stance and hold, your trigger squeezing. Find the best pellets for your guns - the ones with which it gives you the best group and then stick to them.  If you have the opportunity to tune your gun, tune it for accuracy and consistency, and if you can get a few more fps out of it, consider it a bonus. If you have a gun with an adjustable trigger, dont mess around with unless you know what you are doing. \n\nA little not on pellets. Perhaps I am preaching to the choir here, but there is no one best pellet for every gun. Even two HW80''s,  both 0.22 cal, may behave differently with the same pellets One may shoot one hole groups with H&N FTS while the other may be spraying the same pellets in a clover leaf. So dont just take anyone''s word for which is the best pellet. Get as many different pellets as you can and then test your gun with each of them until you find those which give you the best results, and then stick to them.\n\nLast but not the least, do NOT let desi mistris ruin your guns. It will serve you well to either learn gunsmithing yourself or then go a mistri who has the same levels of cleanliness as a surgeon. \n\nHAPPY SHOOTING!', 1, 0, '182.178.48.115', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

However, the more  authentic of the two opinions is that it is Halal (lawful), because the  original ruling concerning eating animals is lawfulness, and only things  that are mentioned in Shari`ah (Islamic law) are prohibited. There is  nothing in the Shari`ah that indicates the prohibition of this animal.  In addition, it is a herbivore like rabbits and deer, not a carnivore,  so there is no reason for prohibiting it. The mentioned animal is a kind  of hedgehog with a coat of sharp spines. Ibn `Umar (may Allah be  pleased with him) was asked about eating hedgehogs, so he recited  Allah''s saying (Exalted be He),[B][COLOR=Blue] Say (O  Muhammad &#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;): "I find not in that which has been  revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat  it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by  slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork)[/COLOR][/B] [Surah Al An`am 6:145]\n(Part No. 23; Page No. 36)\nAn old man said, Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, [B][COLOR=Blue]It is one of the noxious animals[/COLOR][/B]. Ibn `Umar said, "If the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had said this, it is true, then."[Related by Ahmad]\nThis indicates that he (may Allah be pleased with him) had no idea  whether the Messenger of Allah had said anything about a hedgehog. It is  also clear that he did not believe the mentioned old man. This Hadith  was ranked as Da`if (weak) by Al-Bayhaqy and other scholars due to  anonymity of this man. Thus, it is concluded that its lawfulness is true  and its prohibition is a weak opinion.

My opinion remains unchanged- the shooters’ ability to shoot has a far greater impact on the defensive use of a firearm than the caliber. One argument for why you should use a .45 over a 9mm is that the surface area of the .45 is 63% bigger than the surface area... of the 9mm. When the .45 punches the hole through you it damages a surface area 63% larger than that of the 9mm. While true, and potentially convincing, I likened it in my head to two students. One scores 10% on a test and the other scores 16.3% on the test and the one is talking trash on the other because he scored 63% more on the test… \r\n\r\nI took this idea and went to work with it.\r\n\r\nI am an average sized dude at 5''11" and, ahem, a bit over 200 pounds. I put a ruler to my chest and abdomen. There is an area on the front of my body which is 10” by 23” where if you shot me I would REALLY not appreciate it much. You would shoot it with a bullet which is either .452” across or 9mm across.\r\n\r\nUh, hmmm, different standards of measure: Let’s use the metric system. So them there bullets would be either 9mm or 11.48mm across. These circles have a radius of either 4.5mm or 5.74mm.\r\nThe frontal surface area of my “I really don’t want you shooting me” area is 254mm by 584.2mm which calculates to 148,386.8 square millimeters. That’s right almost 150,000 square millimeters.\r\n\r\nThe surface area of them bullets is 64.62 square millimeters for the 9mm and 103.5 square millimeters for the .45. For the really sharp readers you can already see the point.\r\n\r\nThe 9mm punches a hole which is 64.62 square millimeters divided by 148,386.8 square millimeters. That 9mm is only 0.04% of the surface area of my “please don’t shoot me zone.” The .45 is only slightly better at .06975% of the surface area of the same area.\r\n\r\nI gave the bullets far more credit than they deserved. It’s like they took a 10,000 question test and one got 4 questions right and the other got… ok, 7 questions right. And the friends of Mr. I Got 7 Questions Right, are talking heap big trash on the friends of the guy who only got 4 questions correct. That’s pretty pathetic, don’t you think?\r\n\r\nSo, the surface area is 63% larger argument really doesn’t work for me since the original hole was so paltry to begin with. Now, consider this… Most of the gun-board commandos can’t shoot.\r\n\r\nThese guys puffing their chest and stroking their ego because they are a .45 fan-boy are missing that bulls-eye by 4”, 6” or even 12” all the time. To convert that to metric- they are missing by 101.6mm, 152.4mm or even 304.8” with a bullet that it 2.48mm larger in diameter. Let that sink in. They invest hours crafting an argument as to why they are better because they use a bullet 2.48mm larger in diameter, but miss by 100mm to 300mm. Their inability to shoot has an effect 41 to 123 times greater than their bullet diameter does.\r\n\r\nLearn to shoot.\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.facebook.com/#!/TheDeadeyeMethod/posts/556470631040646[/url]', 1, 1, '139.76.64.66', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If anything, the gun is probably as accurate or more as it was on day one. The first bird I shot with this gun was at about 45 yards and it''s head was plastered on the tree where it was sitting. The last one was a pigeon that I took at a similar distance inside a big warehouse. This bird was hiding inside the open portion of a 4 inch high wiring duct, and I got it too with a head shot. \r\n\r\nThis gun is more accurate than I am. The only care I have taken of it, is to oil it regularly but sparingly ( I use a 10cc syringe loaded with Hoppe''s gun oil), and make it a point not to let any oil get inside the cylinder or on the mainspring. \r\n\r\nOveroiling attracts dust, and that causes wear and tear, so go easy on the gun oils. \r\n\r\nSecond last but not the least, though I dont have scopes on any of my airguns currently, but I do have a few on my centerfire and rimfire rifles, and one very useful tip I have discovered is that prior to mounting the scope on the gun one should optically centre it on both axes, i.e. horizontally and vertically.  To do this, all you need is old and sturdy shoe box, a spirit level, and a wall about thirty feet away.

I have the following questions from the seniors ..\n\n1. Now can I easily sale my stoeger if I dont get my licenses duplicates issued? and what will be the legal way of selling it as its still on my license and on my name (even though I lost the license) and also i didnt register the FIR for it as Police simply said its a very hectic process and I need to at least give them with my license numbers or a copy of my license cards but unluckily I just didnt even have a copy of them or dunt even remember my license numbers as I was a novice and got very excited to see my licenses, didnt even bother to write down my license numbers, so an advice to you all guys always keep a copy of your license cards .. so can I sale my stoeger now? cuz I think if i dont get the duplicates issued may be I can apply for a new license once licenses are opened up and then buy a new gun for it, as keeping my stoeger right now is illegal I know that which makes me a bit dump too and if I dont get my duplicate licenses issued in next 2 months I will surely want to sale it up ..\n\nThanks guys ..[/QUOTE]\nbro i thnk i can help u with u r both licences or i can help u to sell them but if u r true then if not bro i can''t bcz u know its a matter of weapons and where r u from if u r karachi then i can help u if not i can''t :(', 1, 0, '182.178.127.171', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

After we were finished with our hunting activities and had lunch and some rest, a friend who brought along his licensed Type 56-1, thought to see the accuracy of his weapon by hitting the stones placed at 25 meter increments. But the weapon jammed after few rounds roared through the pipe. How can it be? One of the most successful and rugged weapon platform ever built jamming so miserably. The firearm was checked and it was observed that that the bullet case swelled in the chamber and thus, caused Failure to Eject. The face of the owner of the AK worth looked at. He was already depressed with thought of any mechanical problem with the gun and the slight jokes of the group added some insult to the injury. The gun was field stripped and stuck case was painstakingly removed. The owner again thought to fire some bullets to confirm the gun was OK. But this time the gun failed to complete the cycle with the very first cartridge it was fed with. It was once again field stripped to be checked and it was the same problem again. It was suggested by another friend that the matter seems to be ammo related thus the ammo available in other magazine may be used. When other magazine, which contained Russian &#8220;Tula&#8221; ammo, was inserted, the gun fired entire magazine without any hiccup.\n  In the night, we discussed the issue and when I observed the magazine with the ammo that caused the problem twice, I observed that it was filled with a variety of ammunition, with different headstamps ,with  one thing in common that it entirely appeared to be military surplus ammo.  I started to look at each and every cartridge carefully and the results were interesting. I found some bullets different from others. Some bullets looked and felt different particularly at the neck; shoulder and tip of projectile but only a minute and careful examination would reveal the differences. They had their primers to be looked unusual too. I shared the result with rest of group and invited them to observe them the dissimilarities in the bullets. My observation was agreed upon by as well as differed by  my colleagues and we had a good and productive discussion on the issue . Anyway, since it was a hectic day, we went to sleep after Dinner. \n  I have gotten PB licenses too, so when I returned, I took the ammo available with me and found that the ammo I have, also possesses the same variations. I segregated the bullets on the basis of such variation and thought to open them. When I opened the first of them, the results were shocking. That round was a fake one. It contained something greenish stuff like dry weed instead of silver gray (Chamankar Surmai) shining powder grains. I opened the second one, and the result was the same. It was also one of the fake bullets. I opened the third , but this time it was an original , I felt sorry to spoil an original bullet and decided to observe the differences more keenly , yet when I opened the next bullet , it happened to be the another original. Heck, what am I doing?  I said to myself, I should be more careful as I cannot waste my ammo on mere suspicion. I took another careful and over all inspection of ammo again and on the basis of that observation made the segregation afresh. Finally I started to open the &#8220;condemned&#8221; cartridges and one by one they revealed themselves to be the fake. Most of my stash of ammo consisted upon the supposed-to-be-Russian military surplus-ammo, which I got years ago but fortunately never fired a single one. All of those proved to be the fake. But I am happy I did not fire a single one in my gun.  \n  The differences I observed between original and fake ammo appear to me to be \n  [FONT=Calibri]1)      [/FONT]The difference between primers. The primers of fake rounds seems to be more depressed \n  [FONT=Calibri]2)      [/FONT]The neck and shoulder area of the fake round appear to be wider\n  [FONT=Calibri]3)      [/FONT]The tip of projectile of fake a fake round is more pointed and sharp.\n  [FONT=Calibri]4)      [/FONT]Some of the fake rounds even feel different in hand. It seems that those are made of inferior material.\n  We take a lot of care of our firearms that we purchase from our hard-earned money and discuss a lot about them for being sure to get a genuine firearm and to avoid to end up with a clone, but once we get a weapon of our choice, all of our concentration get focused on its maintenance, lubrication, oiling etc and a very less heed is paid on what ammo we are putting through it. It is enough for us to just to ask verbally the dealer selling us the ammo that &#8220;Ammo is OK na&#8221;, and we expect that if the ammo is fake, the eyes of that dealer would be filled with tears and he would say &#8220;No my brother, I have just sold a packet of fake ammo to you, I have betrayed your trust, I should be punished for that&#8221;.  However I this never happens, rather, the dealer locks eyes and says &#8220;how can i do this thing to any of my customer, especially with you, I consider you as my elder/younger brother&#8221; and we take that ammo happily and on the next day, we send all the lead down range and return home happily.  We are less knowledgqble and apprehensive about the havoc fake ammo could play with our firearm. I discussed the issue with a very good gunsmith of my area and he told me that he has seen countless rifles that have been devastated by such fake ammo. According to him, the fake ammo contains some propellant that has so severe bang that it badly damages the inner mechanism of firearm in first instance. Secondly, the bullet it sends in barrel is made of third class material and its jacket is made of iron instead of copper that literally destroys the groves, lands and chrome plating. The fake bullet is also open from the rear, instead of being boat tailed and the corners of the copper metal jacket are not folded/curved, thus, the lead used in automobile batteries (out of which those fake bullets are made of) injure the gun first (that fires it) and never hits the target as its weight and the force generated by that bogus propellant is never calibrated.  &#8230;&#8230;. Well , after what I saw on opening the fake rounds myself ,  I don&#8217;t  see any reason to disagree the gentleman . \n  Let me show you what I saw. \n   Please note that the ammo shown here is covered by a legally issued valid PB license and several pictures of one round are taken from different angles for general information and education purpose \n   \n   \n  My sophisticated tools for opening the rounds\n   \n  \n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/35.jpg[/IMG]\n\n  \n  The bullet&#8217;s tail (Boat tail?)\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/2-4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1270.photobucket.com/albums/jj613/zainulabdeen/1-4.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 0, '39.51.48.146', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Alot of us can get easily discouraged and disheartened when we wish to order an accessory and some jerk thinks that the part we are ordering may bring judgement day... like for example a ''universal pawl for Ruger Single Six''... Wow, sounds like kryptonite which could kill Superman... lolz  A universal pawl allows the cylinder of the revolver to rotate in either direction... thats it.  Now why should that not be allowed to order internationally?  What idiots...  Basically you have a law requiring permit to export... but to make it more idiotic... the people approving don''t know a thing about firearms!  So all they do is see Pakistan and its a rejection... and blah blah blah.... \nOk, so for sometime now I have been working on making these accessories here because: A. I like to work on this stuff.  B. I can also earn money.  C. I love to be critiqued - whether good or bad.  D. Lolz, I would like to be nicknamed ''Grand Master'' one day... lolz.  So, slowly I am going to start, manufacturing of accessory parts and have various people test them and then put a writeup on it.  I have in the works now a lot of 1911 stuff as well.  I do hope I can perform up-to-par for most of you guys.\nEverything can be done here... It just takes a long time thats all.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nReally really appreciate your spirit Akhi...We can do everything in this world and at par with international standards.... All we need to do is put in all we got.. the reason Pakistani products (all sorts) have quality problem sometimes somewhere is simply because of dishonesty and carelessness at any of the production steps... that`s it... \n\nThere`s nothing on this planet we can not do.... after all we are a country with nuclear power :smile:', 1, 1, '110.93.196.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
