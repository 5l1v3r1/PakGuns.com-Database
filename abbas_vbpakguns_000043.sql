I am not new to cartridges and I have an extensive collection of metric-military ammunition. I am an advanced collector of 7.62x25 Tokarev/7.63 Mauser ammunition, which I have learned is called ".30 Bore" in your part of the world.\nI am excited because in my first look here I found so many new examples of .30/7.62 boxes, manufacturers, and headstamps. It is very interesting to see the imports from China and Serbia. Chinese ammunition is no longer imported into the US and I am pleased to see they are still producing it. The cartridges from Desi/Darra (which is correct?) are absolutely unknown outside of Pakistan.\nI found some great pictures in the "Ammunition Report" section, but in some of the pictures the headstamp markings were difficult to read. I would be very grateful if some members here could post photos of all the .30 Bore boxes and headstamps they have available.\nIf there is any interest, I will gladly post pictures of some of the boxes and Tokarev cartridges in my collection. I have ball, tracer, dummy, blank, API, proof, and other loadings from Russia, China, US, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and East Germany; and also boxes from many of them. Unfortunately I have none from Pakistan!\nI hope this is my first of many posts.\nOh, I also shoot a lot, and have 2 Tokarev pistols.

First i checked out the accuracy by firing on cardboard targets the size of a normal human being at 5, 10, 15, 25 and 35 meters-and that was reenacting a conceal carry situation where i was surprised by this pistol''s accuracy! Perfect groupings (well not really at 25 and 35m but i think that was my fault. Most of you must know about double taps and the Mozambique drill and this pistol is great-probably the fastest firing pistol around-excluding auto''s of course  ;) . For the CCW part, i used Norinco white box ammo which is really good! No malfunctions whatsoever. Also, the powder burns cleanly and doesn''t produce much smoke. Then, i tested a few Philippine Armscor 9mm Jacketed Hollow Points (what i use when i carry) and they worked just fine. \n\n     After that, I wanted to fire a few mag dumps so i loaded 4 mags with 17 rounds of POF (since i had finished all my Norinco rounds  :D ) and set off with my phone, driver, guard and some other guy. Okay, now since this was perhaps my first video, please go a little light on the criticism (i''m only sixteen!) and plus the "camera man" was my driver so you can get an idea of it. I fired perhaps the cheapest , crappiest rounds available which did produce a lot of smoke but still the pistol functioned fine! I am a happy Taurus owner. Some people say that this gun is ammo sensitive but i''ve fired Wolf, federal, norinco, pof, phillipine JHP''s, and lots of other types of ammo through this gun and have [b]NEVER[/b] suffered a malfunction. Maybe later batches might have problems (e.g those of 2009) or they might have had factory defects but mine of 2008 has no problems at all! Back to the fun part, after firing 4 mags, I went back to the car, reloaded the mags and even tried to show how to clear a dud round and a stovepipe-which you can see i wasn''t that good at saying but again, while standing in front of 3 people who dont give a damn about what your doing and just want to hear a bang, its kinda difficult  :/ . Anyway, i''m happy with it as i fired 400 rounds through it without cleaning and i think it''s reliable! \n\nMODS DELETED YOUR VDO''S\n\nAlso, i had a really bad haircut  :( .....never gonna get my hair cut in my vliiage *sighs*\n\nHere are a few pictures of it after i shot it. I just wanted to show you how dirty it became-mostly due to POF''s bullets\nand this is the first time i''ve ever posted pictures on pakguns so i resized them but i''m not sure if i did to the proper size sorry! (you can always open them in a new tab  :rolleyes: )\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/atmcvan8/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/5kNW0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rp4jyutg/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/vnjY0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rpctnlac/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/vnwqJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/vnDV9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rpoef0qs/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/vnNTJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rpq1yd8k/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/vnQnS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rpzz6g78/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/vo4lJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rq1mpsp0/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/vo6QS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rq6lbu6c/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/voeki.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rqbjxvno/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/volOJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rqgijx50/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/voti9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rqlh5ymc/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/voAMA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rqqfs03o/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/voIg0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rqvee1l0/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/voPKr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rqx1xe2s/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/voSeA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/1rr3o2s1w/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/vp1d9.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '115.186.39.192', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6085, 168642),

The slides are flawlessly tight and produce amazing results from a combat gun.\nI hav not yet fired it but played around with it ,it is slightly muzzle heavy which is good for IPSC and speed shooting.

I had been looking for a chance to review one but  did not know anyone who owned one. Today a friend lent me his new M22 to test to my desire and satisfaction !\n\nAs this is not a major item and is mostly a curio, I will keep the review short. \n\nThe pistol feels really nice to hold, the grip angle is good, the finish is clean. Very pointable, sights are Glock like, the trigger is identical to Glock''s ''Safe Action'' and functions fine. The pull is not crisp and very average. Disassembly seems Glock like as well but I could not get it open (to be fair did not read the manual, was in a hurry to test it). In all you feel like you''re handling a quality pistol and it will shoot the crap out of everything. \n\nWell, that''s where the good news ends, it doesn''t. It simply fails to perform. I started the test with three different types of ammo. Eley Club, Eley Sport, Armscor (not pictured) and Federal GameShok. All misfired without exception. In firing about 100 rounds or 10 ten mags, not one was without FTF or FTE. Often I had to use a flat screwdriver to pull empty shells stuck in the barrel a few times as well. The firing pin strikes were haywire and not consistent at all. The ISSC was a big disappointment for me as I was expecting it to work well and certainly much better than my Akdal Mini 06. Compared the Mini06 would win in about every department, size, concealment, accuracy, reliability, beauty and price.\n\nIt started retailing for around 70 K but is now selling for a final price of 45 K.\n\n[b]\nVerdict: Good looking Trash.[/b] \n\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC3_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC4_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC5_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC6_resize.jpg[/img]\n\nOn the above target I was aiming dead center.

(148498, 4119, 142273, 'Rizshu', 807, '', 1286057129, '[b]Handguns for Home Defense [/b]\n\nHandguns are the most popular firearms for home defense. A pistol is handy indoors and can be conveniently concealed almost anywhere in the home, ready for use. It is the easiest of all guns to retain in a hand to hand struggle. It can be fired from either hand in an emergency situation. (This is especially true of revolvers). Centerfire pistols and revolvers from approximately 9mm/.38 caliber on up, assuming appropriate ammunition is chosen, offer good stopping power for indoor home defense without the extreme risk of over penetration of a deer rifle. They are much less likely to severely damage the home you are trying to protect than a shotgun. For all of these reasons handguns are the first choice of the majority of experts for home defense.\n\nOf the various types of handguns, only revolvers and autoloading pistols should be considered for home defense. Service or concealed carry type handguns are the typical choices. Deep concealment pistols ("mouse guns") are not a good choice for home defense. Why handicap yourself when better guns for the purpose are readily available?\n\nBecause a home defense gun does not normally need to be carried on the person (and if it does an exposed holster and gun belt can be employed), I tend to favor the service type handgun for home defense. These usually come with better sights and are easier to shoot accurately than the smaller, lighter handguns designed primarily for concealed carry.\n\n[b]Autoloading pistols[/b]\n\nAutoloaders, or semi-automatic pistols, are the choice of the world''s military services and the issue weapon of most police forces. Modern examples of service style autoloaders include the Beretta M92 series, Ruger P series, SIG P229 and P239, and the Full-Size and Compact Glock pistols. All of these are double action or safe action pistols that can be safely stored with the chamber loaded and the safety (if present) off. If the whistle blows it is not necessary to manually cycle the action or manipulate a safety, just pull the trigger and the gun will fire. In this they are much like a double action revolver.\n\nAutoloaders hold more cartridges than the ordinary revolver, typically about 10 rounds, and are faster to reload if a pre-loaded magazine is handy. However, autoloaders are very slow to reload from a box of loose cartridges--the situation that usually pertains if a homeowner shoots his or her pistol empty. An autoloader can deliver very rapid fire, but remember that you can''t miss fast enough to win a gunfight. Unlike the characters in the movies, you have to take the time to aim if you are to successfully defend your home!\n\nAutoloading pistols are more likely to jam than a revolver, particularly if fired through cloth, say from under a bathrobe in a sudden emergency, from an unusual orientation (upside down for instance), or with a "limp wrist" (insecure hold). They have one other very significant drawback: they are magazine fed and the spring in a loaded magazine is tightly compressed. Magazines should be rotated on, at least, a monthly basis. The spring in a loaded magazine left unattended for an extended period of time may take a "set" and then lack the pressure to reliably feed cartridges, causing a jam.\n\nA high quality autoloader, owned and maintained by an experienced shooter, is a very good home defense weapon. It is perhaps not so good for the casual user who is not a recreational shooter.\n\n[b]Revolvers[/b]\n\nMy top choice for a home defense gun is a revolver. Revolvers usually hold six cartridges, but some hold more. Revolvers are ambidextrous. Perhaps best of all, they can sit fully loaded and untouched for decades, as all springs are normally at rest, and still be ready to go into service at a moment''s notice. Just grab the gun and commence firing should the need arise. Medium size revolvers, the kind I usually favor for home defense, come in two action styles, single action and double action.\n\n[b]Single action revolvers[/b]\n\nThe single action (SA) revolver must be manually cocked before the trigger will fire the weapon. These are the traditional "western" style guns, such as the Colt Single Action Army and Ruger Blackhawk and Vaquero models. Such guns are slow to reload, but powerful, accurate and deadly when the whistle blows. Their "plowhandle" grip shape fits most hands exceedingly well, making accurate fire comparatively easy. They can be fired rapidly from a two handed hold by cocking the piece with the thumb of the off hand. Never "fan" a single action revolver!\n\nSomewhat like autoloading pistols, I regard SA revolvers as an entirely satisfactory choice for home defense, particularly for experienced shooters, but not the very best choice for the casual user.\n\n[b]Double action revolvers[/b]\n\nThe all-around best choice among handguns for home defense is the double action (DA) revolver. These are the typical "police" style revolvers, such as the Colt Python, Ruger GP100, or the Smith and Wesson Model 10 Military and Police. Double action revolvers may be thumb cocked, just like a single action revolver, and then fired by a light pressure on the trigger. This is generally referred to as shooting "single action," and it is the most accurate way to deliver aimed fire. They may also be fired by a single long pull on the trigger, which first cocks and then releases the hammer (trigger cocking or "double action" shooting).\n\nTrigger cocking requires a longer and much heavier trigger pull, but it is fast. Shots can be delivered as rapidly as from an autoloading pistol. It is sufficiently accurate for close range shooting (out to perhaps 7 yards) in trained hands.\n\nDouble action revolvers are very safe, simple to operate, relatively easy to shoot accurately, very reliable, and extremely difficult to jam. They can be reloaded quickly if a speed loader is employed, and are very easy to reload from a box of loose cartridges should that become necessary. For the average homeowner as well as the expert pistolero, a DA revolver is hard to beat for home defense.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nWhatever gun is chosen for home defense, become familiar with it. Make it a point to practice at reasonable intervals. A handgun can potentially save your life and the lives of your family. But it isn''t the weapon per-se that gets the job done, it is the person behind it. Skill and determination, reinforced by regular practice, will carry the day.', 0, 1, '119.155.43.226', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5837, 168938),

At first I had planned for a two- day visit but had to cut it short to 11 hours duration due to some domestic issues. First of all I would like to thank two Pakguns members who made this trip possible. Naveed_pk and Sohail sahab. These guys went out of the way to help me out in buying my 2 weapons. \n\nFirst, Sohail sahab gave me a big discount of 5k on his Baikal mp161 and then he kept it as Amanat for me for more than a month. I called him at 9.45 (yesterday) in the morning from the airport and he had just woken up. I told him that I was going to his dealer which would take 10-15 minutes and was expecting to wait there for an hour or so for him to reach but to my surprise Sohail sahab was there berfore me. I came to know that not only just he jumped out of bed and reached there but also called the dealer to open the shop before time. We had a good chat and I was charged no transfer fee. I was also gifted the below rubber pellets and casing top by Sohail sahab''s friend (dealer) and was taught how to make 12 bore SG rubber bullets. \nSohail sahab, thank you for all your help and courtesy.\n\n10 days ago, AK-47 sahab referred my query of Winchester Sx3 to Mr. Bond (Naveed_pk). I found Naveed_pk sahab to be a gem of a person. He first managed to arrange the gun for me from PARA but later it came out to be the wooden model (my mistake as I did not mention my requirement of fiber body to Naveed sahab in the first place). I called Naveed sahab and requested him to find the fiber one and he calls me back in 30 minutes saying that he found one. He managed to get it for me at the best rate of 165k and then took the trouble of receiving the payment from me (online) and handing it over to the dealer after checking the gun. \nNaveed sahab, thank you for all your help and effort.\n\n\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l3xrzvdw/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/aoXJA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l4pw4rs4/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/apD80.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l5d1nmp0/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/aqb30.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l655sj38/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/aqRsr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l6vme2zo/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/arumJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l7c5rjxg/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/arTj9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l898iht0/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/asGc0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l8j5qkro/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/asV9S.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/l9b9vh5w/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/atAzi.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '116.71.50.208', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 779, 169021),

The cartridge is often referred to simply as .22 LR and various rifles, pistols, revolvers, and even some smoothbore shotguns have been manufactured in this caliber. It is occasionally referred to by its metric designation of 5.6x15mmR. The cartridge originated from the Flobert BB Cap of 1845 through the .22 Smith & Wesson cartridge of 1857, and was developed by the J. Stevens Arms & Tool Company in 1887[3] by combining the casing of the .22 Long with the 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet of the .22 Extra Long. For many decades, it has been a very popular cartridge around the world. It is one of the few cartridges that are accepted by a large variety of rifles, as well as pistols. Virtually every manufacturer of cartridge firearms makes at least one model chambering it, and this has been true for more than a century. The .22 Long Rifle and related cartridges (.22 Short, .22 Long and .22 Extra Long) use a heeled bullet, which means that the bullet is the same diameter as the case, and has a narrower "heel" portion that fits in the case.\nPopularity\nThe low cost, minimal recoil, and relatively low noise make the .22 LR an ideal cartridge for recreational shooting, initial firearms training, and pest control, and it is often purchased in bulk. The round is popular among novice shooters and experts alike. .22 LR is commonly packaged in boxes of either 100 or 50 rounds, and is often sold by the brick, a carton containing either 10 boxes of 50 rounds or loose cartridges totalling 500 rounds, or the case containing 10 cartons totalling 5,000 rounds.\n.22 LR ammunition is available in a very wide variety, and a very wide price range. Bullet weights range from 20 to 60 grains (1.3 to 3.9 g), velocities from 575 to 1,750 ft/s (175 to 530 m/s). "Promotional" loads for plinking can be found for under US$20.00 per brick ($0.04 per cartridge), while precision target rounds can cost US$80.00 to upwards of US$250.00 per brick. As of June 2010, a box of 50 standard quality FMJ rounds goes for US$3-5. For comparison, a box of similar quality FMJ 9x19 mm Parabellum, another popular and relatively inexpensive round for semi-automatic handguns, costs around US$15 per box of 50. It is common to shoot well over a hundred rounds on a single shooting range visit. For rifle shooting, the price difference is even more dramatic as powerful rifle cartridges like .308 Winchester and .30-06 Springfield can approach and exceed US$1 per cartridge. For this reason especially, .22 LR is commonly used by hunters for off-season target practice. They are also the ammunition used by Boy Scouts for the rifle shooting merit badge.\nThe low recoil of a .22 LR cartridge makes it ideal for introductory firearms courses. Due to their lack of shooting experience, most novice shooters are surprised and frightened by the recoil of handguns and rifles chambered even for rounds considered mild by experienced shooters. Starting with calibers above the shooter''s comfort level frequently leads to the beginner developing a habit of flinching in an attempt to counter the anticipated recoil and ruining the correct posture and follow-through at the most critical phase of the shot. This habit is difficult to undo after it is developed. With the high recoil out of the picture, any other errors in marksmanship technique are easier to identify and correct than they would be on the more powerful guns.\nAR-15 upper receivers and M1911 slide assemblies are available for this round. CZ Model 75 handguns also have a fixed barrel upper pistol conversion kit to make it shoot .22 ammunition. These ".22 conversions" allow shooters inexpensive practice while retaining the handling characteristics of their chosen firearms (minus the recoil and muzzle blast). Additionally, .22 kits allow practice at indoor ranges which often prohibit high-power rifles. The ''fun factor'' from shooting a high powered pistol or rifle with low energy bullets when converted to .22 is another reason for the conversion kits as well as the much lower costs for practice ammunition. Owners of guns that use gas systems, such as converted AR-15 style rifles, normally avoid firing unjacketed .22LR ammunition. Unless the bullet is covered with a copper jacket, the lead from the bullets will eventually clog the gas port inside the barrel and require extensive gunsmithing to clear out.\nAnnual production is estimated at 2–2.5 billion rounds.\n\nPerformance\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTwo .22 LR rounds compared to a .45 ACP cartridge.\n.22 LR is effective within 150 yards (140 m), although practically this range will be much less. After 150 yards the ballistics of the round are such that the large "drop" will be difficult to compensate. The relatively short effective range, low report, and light recoil has made it a favorite for use as a target practice cartridge. The accuracy of the cartridge is good, but not exceptional; various cartridges are capable of the same or better accuracy. A contributing factor in rifles is the transition of even a high-velocity cartridge projectile from supersonic to subsonic within 100 yards (91 m). As the bullet slows, the shock wave caused by supersonic travel overtakes the bullet and can disrupt its flight path, causing minor but measurable inaccuracy.\nWhen zeroed for 100 yards (91 m), the trajectory of the standard high-velocity .22 LR with a 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet has a 2.7-inch (69 mm) rise at 50 yards (46 m), and 10.8 inches (270 mm) drop at 150 yards (140 m).[6] A .22 LR rifle needs to be zeroed for 75 yards (69 m) to avoid over-shooting small animals like squirrels at intermediate distances[6]\nAs a hunting cartridge, the .22 LR is mainly used to kill small game such as rats and squirrels. It is also highly effective on rabbits at distances closer than 150 yards (140 m) and on ground hogs, marmots, and foxes closer than 80 yards (73 m). It has been successfully used on large creatures such as coyotes, but range should be limited to no farther than 65 yards (59 m); head and chest shots are mandatory with the most powerful .22 cartridge the hunter can use accurately.\nA .22 LR bullet is far less powerful than larger cartridges, but dangerous nonetheless; in fact its deceptive "low-power" reputation can make it more dangerous because some shooters do not pay it the same respect as larger cartridges, and shoot it carelessly. It can easily kill or severely injure humans and large animals.[7][8] Even after flying 400 yards (370 m), a stray .22 bullet is still traveling at approximately 500 ft/s (150 m/s) per second, which can inflict a very serious wound, and a standard .22 cartridge can have a ballistic range of up to a 1.5 miles (2,400 m). Ricochets are more common in .22 LR projectiles than for more powerful cartridges as the combination of unjacketed lead and moderate velocities allows the projectile to deflect - not penetrate or disintegrate - when hitting hard objects at a glancing angle.\n.22 Long Rifle bullets are generally either plain lead (for standard velocity loads) or plated with copper or gilding metal (for high velocity or hyper velocity loads). The thin copper layer on the bullet functions as a high velocity lubricant reducing friction between the bullet and the barrel, thus reducing barrel wear. It also prevents oxidation of the lead bullet. Lead tends to oxidize if stored for long periods. Oxide on the bullet''s surface could increase its diameter enough to either prevent insertion of the cartridge into the chamber, or - with hyper velocity rounds - cause dangerously high pressures in the barrel, potentially rupturing the cartridge case and injuring the shooter. Standard and subsonic cartridges use a wax lubricant on lead bullets for the same purpose at lower velocities.\n Variants\nThere are a variety of different types of .22 LR loads. They are often divided into four distinct categories, based on nominal velocity:\n•	Subsonic, which also includes "target" or "match" loads, at nominal speeds below 1,100 ft/s (340 m/s). \n•	Standard-velocity: 1,000–1,135 ft/s (300–346 m/s). Common velocities are 1050-1070 feet (320-325 meters) per second. \n•	High-velocity: 1,200–1,310 ft/s (370–400 m/s) per second. \n•	Hyper-velocity, or Ultra-velocity: over 1,400 ft/s (430 m/s). \n Subsonic\n\nSubsonic rounds have a muzzle velocity less than the Speed of sound (approximately 1,080 ft/s (330 m/s)). These rounds are sometimes equipped with extra heavy bullets of 46–61-grain (3.0–4.0 g) to improve the terminal ballistics of the slower projectile. Conversely, the rounds can contain little more than primer and an extra-light bullet.\nSubsonic rounds are favored because of slightly superior accuracy and reduction in noise. Supersonic rounds produce a loud crack which can scare away animals when hunting. Accuracy is improved with subsonic rounds, because any supersonic bullet (or projectile) that slows down from supersonic to subsonic speed undergoes drastic aerodynamic changes in this transonic zone that might adversely affect the stability and accuracy of the bullet. Additionally, the use of subsonic rounds may reduce wastage of meat due to the effects of a high-velocity round passing and destroying tissue.[citation needed]\nBecause the speed of sound in air at 68 °F (20 °C) is approximately 1,126 ft/s (343 m/s), the subsonic round''s muzzle velocity is slightly below the speed of sound, under many hunting conditions. However, under cold air conditions at 32 °F (0 °C), the speed of sound drops to 1,088 ft/s (332 m/s), approximately muzzle velocity. Hence, a "subsonic" round used in these temperatures would be supersonic, and when its speed passes from supersonic to subsonic, it may become unstable, reducing accuracy. To counteract this, some cartridge manufacturers have lowered the speed of their subsonic ammunition to 1,030 ft/s (310 m/s), or significantly less.\nSome subsonic rounds do not work well in most semi-automatic .22 LR firearms, often failing to cycle the action due to lack of sufficient recoil energy. Other subsonic rounds use heavier bullets that achieve lower velocities in order to ensure that, with a more massive bullet, there is enough energy to cycle most common blow-back actions. An example of this is the Aguila .22 LR SSS "SubSonic Sniper" round, which has a 60-grain (3.9 g) bullet on .22 Short case, the longer bullet giving the cartridge the overall length of a .22 Long Rifle round. However, this can cause other problems: the heavier and longer bullet of the Aguila cartridge requires a tighter barrel twist (by the Greenhill formula) to ensure that the bullet remains stable in flight.\nThere are two classes of performance in .22 rimfire subsonic rounds. Some subsonic rounds, such as the various .22 Short or .22 Long "CB" rounds, give ~700 ft/s (210 m/s) velocity with 29-grain (1.9 g) bullet with relatively low impact energy. These have the characteristics of "zimmerpatronen" or rounds intended to be used only for indoor training or target practice and not for hunting. The Aguila SSS gives ~950 ft/s (290 m/s) velocity with a 60-grain (3.9 g) bullet equalling the energy level of many .22 Long Rifle high velocity rounds using the standard 40-grain (2.6 g) bullets; other heavy bullet subsonic rounds give similar performance, intended for hunting of game or control of dangerous animals while avoiding unwanted noise.\n[edit] Standard Velocity\nStandard velocity rounds have a slightly supersonic muzzle velocity of around 1,125 ft/s (343 m/s), and a "normal" bullet weight of 40-grain (2.6 g). Standard velocity cartridges generate near or slightly-supersonic velocities. These rounds generally do not develop these velocities in handguns because the short barrel does not take full advantage of the slower powder. The downside to supersonic rounds is that the bullet often drops to subsonic speeds on its way to the target which can degrade accuracy. The extra power and penetration, however, more than make up for the slight loss in accuracy for applications such as small game hunting.\n High Velocity\n\n\n \n\nHigh-velocity, copper-plated .22 LR rounds\nThe Long Rifle was originally loaded with black powder. The first smokeless powder loads were intended to match the standard velocity of the original black powder rounds. Smokeless powder is more efficient than black powder, and the cartridge cases could hold more powder. Smokeless powder loads called "high speed" or "high velocity" were offered by the major ammunition makers giving a typical velocity increase of twenty percent (1,200 feet per second (370 m/s) to 1,300 feet per second (400 m/s) while still using the standard 40-grain (2.6 g) solid or 36-grain (2.3 g) hollow point lead bullet.\n Hyper velocity\nMany .22 LR cartridges use bullets lighter than the standard 40-grain (2.6 g), fired at even higher velocities. Hyper velocity bullets usually weigh around 30-grain (1.9 g) to 32-grain (2.1 g) and can have a muzzle velocity of 1,400 feet per second (430 m/s) to 1,800 feet per second (550 m/s) per second. This higher velocity is partially due to the use of lighter bullets.\nThe CCI Stinger was the first hyper velocity .22 LR cartridge, and provided a significant increase in velocity and energy over standard .22 LR rounds. The Stinger case is longer than that of the Long Rifle (approx. .71 inches (18 mm) versus .595 inches (15.1 mm) for the Long Rifle) but the plated hollow point bullet is lighter and shorter at 32-grain (2.1 g), giving the same overall length as the Long Rifle cartridge. A powder with a slower burning rate is used to make the most use of the length of a rifle barrel. (Most .22 Long Rifle powders increase velocity up to about 19 inches (480 mm) of barrel length; the powder used in the Stinger increases velocity up to the longest .22 barrel length tested by the NRA, 26 inches (660 mm).)\nLater hyper velocity rounds were introduced by other makers based on the Long Rifle case with lighter bullets in the 30-grain (1.9 g) weight range and slow burning rifle powder loadings. The overall length of many of these cartridges was less than the standard overall length of the standard Long Rifle. One example was the Remington Viper.\nThe CCI Velocitor hyper velocity round uses the standard Long Rifle case size and a standard weight 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet of proprietary hollow point design to augment expansion and trauma for hunting. This cartridge has a muzzle velocity of 1,435 feet per second (437 m/s) per second. Due to the better ratio of bullet mass to air resistance, Velocitor performs better at longer range compared to the light bullets of other hyper velocity rounds.\nShot cartridges\n\n\n \n\n.22 Rat-shot.\nSpecial .22 LR caliber shot cartridges, usually loaded with #12 shot, have also been made. These are called "rat-shot" due to their use in very short range pest control. Such rounds have either a longer brass case that is crimped closed, or a translucent plastic "bullet" that contains the shot and shatters upon firing. In specially-made .22 bore shotguns, the shot shells can be used for short range skeet shooting and trap shooting at special, scaled-down, clay targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full metal jacket\nDuring World War II, a full metal jacketed version of the .22 LR was developed for the suppressed High Standard HDM pistol.[9] .\n Cartridge length\n\n\n \n\nA .22 Long, .22 LR, and .22 Winchester Magnum, respectively.\nThe .22 LR uses a straight walled case. Depending upon the type and the feed mechanism employed, a firearm which is chambered for .22 LR may also be able to safely chamber and fire the following shorter rimfire cartridges:\n•	.22 BB, in cap, short or long lengths \n•	.22 CB, in cap, short, long, and long rifle lengths \n•	.22 Short \n•	.22 Long \n.22 Long Rifle may also be used in firearms chambered for the obsolete .22 Extra Long.\nThe .22 Winchester RimFire, also called .22 WRF, and later .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire, also called .22 Magnum or .22 WMR, use cases different from the .22 LR. The .22 WRF and .22 WMR have a significant taper and does not use a heeled bullet. While .22 WRF may be fired in a .22 WMR, firing a .22 S, L or LR in a .22 WMR firearm will likely result in gas leakage at the breech and may cause a potentially dangerous case rupture. Such use always will result in bullet metal fouling in the .22 WMR chamber throat and degraded accuracy with the smaller rounds.\n\n\nUsage\nToday, .22 LR is mainly being used for hunting small pests, for sports shooting, for plinking, and for inexpensive training. The .22 LR is the choice for several ISSF shooting events: 50 metre rifle three positions, 50 metre rifle prone, 50 metre pistol, 25 metre pistol, 25 metre rapid fire pistol and 25 metre standard pistol; Bullseye, plus divisions of metallic silhouette and pin shooting, most high school, collegiate, Boy Scouts of America, Air Training Corps, Australian Army Cadets, Appleseed Project and 4H shooting events, and many others. Good quality .22 LR ammunition can be quite accurate. Its main advantages are low cost, low recoil, low noise and high accuracy-to-cost ratio. Its main disadvantage is its low power; it is better suited for use on small game and other small animals;[10] as a defensive cartridge, it is considered inadequate, though the small size allows very lightweight, easily concealable handguns which can be carried in circumstances where anything larger would be impractical. Despite their limitations, .22 LR pistols and rifles can be lethal and are often used for self defense simply because they are prevalent, inexpensive, and widely available to civilians.\nSemi-automatic rifles firing .22 LR cartridges often will work properly only when firing standard or high velocity .22 LR ammunition; subsonic rounds will often not cycle their actions properly. Bolt-action or lever-action rifles, however, can utilize any of the variants (high velocity to subsonic).\nThe tiny case of the .22 LR and the subsonic velocities (when using subsonic ammunition) make it well suited for use with a firearm suppressor (also known as silencers or sound moderators). The low volume of powder gases means that .22 LR suppressors are often no larger than a bull barrel; the Ruger 10/22 and Ruger MK II are common choices, because of their reliability and low cost, and the resulting product is often nearly indistinguishable from a bull barrel model (although weighing far less). Where firearm suppressors are only minimally restricted, a .22 LR firearm with a suppressor is often favored for plinking, as it does not require hearing protection or disturb the neighbors. Local government agencies sometimes use suppressed .22 LR weapons for animal control, since dangerous animals or pests can be dispatched in populated areas without causing undue alarm.\nThe .22 LR has also seen limited usage by police and military snipers. Its main advantage in this role is its low noise, but it is usually limited to urban operations because of its short range.[11][12]\nThe Israeli military used a suppressed .22 LR rifle in the 1990s for riot control and to "eliminate disturbing dogs prior to operations," though it is now used less often as it has been shown to be more lethal than previously suspected.[11] Some other examples include the use of suppressed High Standard HDM pistols by the American OSS, which was the predecessor organization of the CIA.[9]. Francis Gary Powers was issued a suppressed High Standard for the flight in which he was shot down. Suppressed Ruger MK II pistols are in current use by the US Navy SEALs.\n\n\nSpecifications\n\n\n.22 Long rifle maximum CIP cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimetres (mm).

Developed in 1857 for the first Smith and Wesson revolver, the .22 rimfire was the first American metallic cartridge[2]. The original loading was a 29-grain (1.9 g) or 30-grain (1.9 g) bullet and 4 grains (260 mg) of black powder. The original .22 rimfire cartridge became designated the .22 Short with the introduction of the .22 Long cartridge in 1871. Developed for self defense, the modern .22 Short, though still used in a few pocket pistols and mini-revolvers, is mainly used as a quiet round for practice by the recreational shooter. The .22 Short was popularly used in shooting galleries at fairs and arcades; several rifle makers produced "gallery" models for .22 Short exclusively. Due to its low recoil and good inherent accuracy, the .22 Short was used for the Olympic 25 m Rapid Fire Pistol event until 2004, and they were allowed in the shooting part of modern pentathlon competitions before it switched to air pistols. .22 Short blank cartridges are used in several makes of starting pistols.\nOverview\n \n\n.22 Short cartridge.\n \n\nNorth American Arms model NAA22S mini-revolver, chambered in .22 Short.\nMost .22 Short bullets are made of lead (usually coated with grease or wax or copper plated) in round nose or hollow point styles. Bullets for use at shooting gallerys were often made of compressed powdered metal that disintegrated on impact to avoid ricochets and over-penetration of backstops. The standard velocity .22 Short launches a 29-grain (1.9 g) bullet at 1,045 feet per second (319 m/s) with 70 ft•lbf (95 J) of energy from a 22 in (559 mm) rifle barrel and can penetrate 2 inches (51 mm) of soft pine.[1]\nAs a hunting round, the high velocity hollow point Short is useful only for small game such as tree squirrels and rabbits. For small game hunting in general, the greater energy and wider ammunition selection of the .22 Long Rifle make it a more popular choice. In the American South, the .22 Short hollow point is still very popular for use on raccoons, which are treed at night using dogs and shooting is at close range. In some states, the .22 Short is the only legal round to use for such hunting.\n\n\nAlthough the .22 Long Rifle has surpassed the .22 Short in the market place, many ammunition companies still produce .22 Shorts, and in a fairly wide variety. Most makers utilitilse the standard 29-grain (1.9 g) solid round nose bullet and 27-grain (1.7 g) hollow point bullet weights for the .22 short. CCI makes several types: a CB Short at 727 ft/s (222 m/s), Target Shorts at 830 ft/s (250 m/s), their standard Short round with plated round nose bullet at 1,080 ft/s (330 m/s), and a high speed hunting load with plated hollow point bullet at 1,105 ft/s (337 m/s). The .22 Short high-velocity exceeds the performance of the .22 Long and the .22 Short has displaced the .22 Long as an alternate to the .22 Long Rifle for many .22 shooters. Fiocchi makes their Exacta Compensated Super Match SM200 with lead round nose at 650 ft/s (200 m/s). Remington produces a high velocity plated round nose at 1,095 ft/s (334 m/s). Aguila makes both a match lead round nose at 1,095 ft/s (334 m/s), and a "high speed" round with plated bullet also listed at 1,095 ft/s (334 m/s). Also available is the fine RWS R25 match ammunition at 560 ft/s (170 m/s). Eley also makes their Rapid Fire Match cartridge at 750 ft/s (230 m/s).\nMost of the target oriented and CB shorts are very quiet, due to being subsonic. When fired from a full-length rifle barrel, most .22 Short loadings are as quiet, if not quieter, than the average air rifle.\nThe Aguila SSS (SubSonic Sniper) round uses a .22 Short case with a 60-grain (3.9 g) bullet (twice the weight of the .22 Short bullet and half again as heavy as the .22 Long Rifle bullet) giving an overall length of a .22 Long Rifle round, making categorizing the SSS problematic: while the SSS case size is .22 short, the firing chamber of the barrel must be .22 LR dimensions to accept the SSS cartridge.\n .22 Short caliber rifles\nThere have been many rifles chambered for the .22 Short over the years, but none are currently in production. Many rifles in .22 Short were made between 1901–1940, mostly intended for gallery shooting and small game hunting. Remington and Winchester produced the most rifles in .22 Short. Remington has made their Model 24 and Model 241 "Speedmaster" semi-autos as well as their Model 12 and 121 "Fieldmaster" pump actions in .22 Short. Remington''s Nylon 66GS Gallery Special (1962 to 1981) was one of the last .22 Short-only rifles made especially for shooting gallery use. Winchester produced a variety of different rifles in .22 Short caliber including the 1873 lever action, 1885 single shot (in both Low Wall and High Wall variations), Model 1890, 1906 and 62A pump actions, Model 74 semi-auto and the Model 61 pump action. Many of their bolt action rifles were available on a special order basis in .22 Short. Browning/FN also produced their dainty takedown semi-auto in .22 Short, on the same John Browning design upon which the Remington Model 24 is based.\nNote that many of these rifles are now collectors’ items, particularly the Winchesters, and demand a premium in price over the same rifle chambered in .22 Long Rifle.\nIt should also be noted that many rifles marked ".22 Short, Long and Long Rifle" (or ".22 S, L, LR") will not shoot Short rounds with the same degree of accuracy as they will a Long Rifle nor as accurately as a rifle designed for .22 Short exclusively. This is due to the .22 Short round using a 27–29 grain bullet, which requires a barrel with a 1-20 to 1-24 twist. A rifle for "Short, Long and Long Rifle" will normally have a 1-16 twist, which is proper for .22 Long Rifle rounds using 40 grain bullets. In addition, the excess chamber length needed to allow chambering of .22 LR cartridges requires \n\nthe bullet from a .22 Short to travel a short distance before it engages the rifling, which is detrimental to accuracy. If one is intending to shoot only Shorts and wants a high degree of accuracy, one would be best served with a rifle designed and chambered for the Short only.\n.22 Short\n \n\n.22 Short, left; .22 Long Rifle, right\n\nType	Rimfire\nPlace of origin	 USA\n\nProduction history\nManufacturer	Smith & Wesson\nProduced	1857\nSpecifications\nBullet diameter\n.223 in (5.7 mm)\nNeck diameter	.224 in (5.7 mm)\nBase diameter	.225 in (5.7 mm)\nRim diameter	.273 in (6.9 mm)\nRim thickness	.040 in (1.0 mm)\nCase length	.423 in (10.7 mm)\nOverall length	.686 in (17.4 mm)\nPrimer type\nRimfire\nBallistic performance\nBullet weight/type	Velocity	Energy\n27 gr (1.7 g) RN	1,164 ft/s (355 m/s)	81 ft•lbf (110 J)\n29 gr (1.9 g) RN	830 ft/s (250 m/s)	44 ft•lbf (60 J)\n49 gr (3.2 g) RN	1,132 ft/s (345 m/s)	140 ft•lbf (190 J)\nSource: Cartridges of the World [1]\n\n\n\n.22 Long\n\n22 Long is a variety of .22 caliber (5.6 mm) rimfire ammunition. The .22 Long is the second oldest of the surviving rimfire cartridges, dating back to 1871, when it was loaded with a 29 grain (1.9 g) bullet and 5 grains (0.32 g) of black powder, 25% more than the .22 Short it was based on. It was designed for use in revolvers, but was soon chambered in rifles as well.[1]\nIn 1887 the .22 Long case was combined with the heavier 40 grain (2.6 g) bullet of the .22 Extra Long of 1880 to produce the .22 Long Rifle giving a longer overall length, a higher muzzle energy and superior performance as a hunting and target round, rendering the .22 Long and .22 Extra Long obsolete. For a time there was a price difference between the .22 Long and .22 Long Rifle and the .22 Long held on with budget minded shooters until the price advantage finally disappeared. No new firearms are designed specifically to use .22 Long and the largest 3 producers of .22 Long ammunition ceased production (although it continues to be made by CCI, Aguila, and others). Many .22 Long Rifle guns will chamber and fire the shorter round, though the .22 Long generally does not generate sufficient energy to operate semi-automatic guns. The one prominent survivor of the .22 Long is the .22 CB Long, a long-cased version of the .22 CB.\nWhile the original .22 Long loading used the same powder charge as the .22 Long Rifle, the .22 Long bullet was significantly lighter, and the combination did not result in higher velocities for the .22 Long when fired from a rifle. The large barrel volume to chamber volume ratio of a .22 rimfire rifle means that the powder gasses have expanded as far as they can well before the bullet reaches the muzzle of a normal length rifle barrel, and the light .22 Long bullet has less inertia than the .22 Long Rifle. This means that the .22 Long bullet (and to a lesser extent the .22 Long Rifle in most loadings) actually slows down significantly before it exits the barrel.\nSince the .22 Long Rifle performs as well in a short handgun barrel as the .22 Long and outperforms it significantly in a long rifle barrel, the development of the .22 Long Rifle assured the .22 Long''s path to obsolescence.\nIn a sense, though, descendants of the .22 Long still live on, though they are not sold as such. Modern Hypervelocity loadings of the .22 Long Rifle use bullets as light as 30 grains (1.9 g), and special blends of powder to make full use of a rifle barrel to generate velocities far higher than normal loads, and chamber pressures high enough to cycle semi-automatic firearms reliably. The most well known of these is the CCI Stinger, which actually goes so far as to stretch the case length slightly, so that with the short, light bullet, the overall length is still within the max overall length for the .22 Long Rifle.\n\n\n\n\n\n.22 Long\n \n\nType	Rimfire\nPlace of origin	 USA\n\nProduction history\nProduced	1871\nSpecifications\nParent case\n.22 Short\n\nBullet diameter\n.223 in (5.7 mm)\nNeck diameter	.224 in (5.7 mm)\nBase diameter	.225 in (5.7 mm)\nRim diameter	.272 in (6.9 mm)\nRim thickness	.042 in (1.1 mm)\nCase length	.595 in (15.1 mm)\nOverall length	.798 in (20.3 mm)\nPrimer type\nRimfire\nBallistic performance\nBullet weight/type	Velocity	Energy\n29 gr (1.9 g) RN	1,038 ft/s (316 m/s)	67 ft•lbf (91 J)', 0, 1, '119.158.169.48', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6101, 169030),

The interesting thing in this kit, is [b]that it uses a fixed barrel, thus eliminating the tilting barrel setup of the original Browning design[/b], with immediate potential benefits in the accuracy of the pistol. The Avenger is a "Fixed Barrel Conversion" for the M1911 with "[b]Delayed Blowback[/b]" mechanism.\n\nFurthermore: \n\n[b]It also features twin ejection ports[/b], [b]and the user can select the side to which his empties would be thrown out from[/b]. Finally, at the rear of the slide, you can find some low-profile cocking handles. The whole top-end is mounted on the 1911 frame in the standard way, using the slide stop.\n\n\nAnd: \n\n[b]According to the manufacturer[/b]:\n\nThe Avenger is an entirely new handgun action that is different from anything else ever made before! This new action eliminates the problems associated with using a fixed barrel with high power cartridges. The Avenger is not gas operated and in comparison installs easily on the frame and doesn''t suffer from gas operated fouling problems, in fact, the Avenger even works well with lead bullets. [b]The extreme accuracy comes from a match barrel fixed in place with the sighting device, there is simply no movement between the sight and the barre[/b]l. The fixed barrel eliminates the need for the costly gunsmithing required to precision fit a conventional slide and barrel. [b]Installation is so simple you can take the Avenger upper off and put the stock slide on in a matter of minutes.[/b]\n\nWho''s gonna get the first?  ;) \n\nWonder if it would be Taurus compatible?  :rolleyes:', 0, 1, '119.154.130.144', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6103, 169097),

After 02 years, they will repair the gun free of charge except parts.\n\nin addition to producing Safir T 14 shotguns and its uppers, they will also be producing T 15 (.223 cal. semiauto model) and T 22 (.22 rimfire model) in USA.\nThey have plans to add .308 and 5.7 models to their armory in the very near future. \n\nYou can read the reviews at:\n\n[url]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/01/26/at-14-the-410-ar-15-shotgun/#comment-5669[/url]\n [url]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/07/06/safir-arms-t-14-410-ar-15-uppers-now-available/[/url]\n[url]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/02/27/safir-t-14-ati-at-14-shotgun-photos/[/url]\n[url]http://forum.saiga-12.com/index.php?showtopic=21560[/url]\n\nthe guns is sold to the whole sale dealers at $850.00 to US and European dealers. And retails at $1000.00 or Euro 1000.00 in Europe. \n\nHaving said that,  I want to say that Pakistani market/dealers donot buy the expansive guns.  That is why it is not popular in Pakistan.   ?f any one is interested, i can persuade the company to sell the same gun ( without changes ) to Pakistani importers at a Price of $599.00. I can do this because i have special relations with this company.', 0, 1, '173.79.94.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3684, 169101),

Their quality, workmanship and totally missing an autoloader product line. Well...........That was yesterday. Let’s review their latest offering, a 12 gauge autoloader shotgun.\n\nIn typical Daudsons tradition, the shotgun is made by using the best of materials and technology available in Pakistan. The CNC machined receiver is made using imported bar stock aircraft grade aluminum alloy. The barrel is made out of imported 4140 Chrome-Moly Steel bar stock. The wooden furniture is carved out of hand picked/selected walnut after evaluating grain, quality and density of wood by master gunsmiths at DSA. Another thing worth mentioning here is that this time they have incorporated flush mounted screw-in chokes into the design to increase the versatility of the shotgun.\n\nMr. Nooruddin, the managing director of DSA called me up a few days back to give me the news of their new offering and to enlighten me on some of its salient features. Since most of you guys know me and my high-on-the-demand-side-personality when it comes to shotguns, I immediately requested some additions/customizations. To be honest, I basically asked too much from DSA. Being the kind gentleman that Mr. Nooruddin is, he immediately reworked the design and obliged me with a shotgun that is truly made as my specifications within days. Yesterday, I collected the "Pakguns Review Piece" from DSA Peshawar.\n\n[b]Specifications:[/b]\n\nGauge: 12 Gauge\nType: Gas Operated Auto-loading Repeater aka Autoloader (or Semi auto)\nBarrel Length: 26 Inches\nBarrel Material: 4140 Chrome-Moly Steel\nMagazine Capacity: 4+1\nChokes: 3 flush screw-in type chokes (IC, M, F)\nFurniture: Wood (select walnut with hand rubbed oil finish)\nSafety location: Behind the trigger guard\nFinish: Barrel = nice deep blue, Receiver = Powder coated\nSights: brass front bead, Receiver dovetailed for scope mount\nSlug firing Capability: Yes!\nPrice: PKR 27,000 with single barrel and wood furniture (without hard carry case).\n\n[b]Other Options available to customers:[/b]\n1. 28inch barrel length with screw-in chokes (PKR 5200)\n2. 21inch barrel length, cylinder bore and rifle sights for a dedicated smooth bore slug gun\n3. Complete plastic furniture. Buttstock and forend\n4. pistol grips, incase somebody wants to convert their shotgun into “I don’t know what purpose gun”\n5. Beautiful hard carry case with dual combination lock. Designed and manufactured at DSA. Accommodates, shotgun with all accessories and extra barrel.

At best, a pistol will never be as effective as a rifle or shotgun, but most JHP will be better than a standard ball loading.\nThe .32 pistol cartridge is a bit different. It is better than nothing, but it should not be your first choice if there is even a remote possibility that you might need a firearm. Close to home I will usually carry a small .32, but if I go towards the city or on a trip, I have a Makarov or Browning Hi-Power.

Having a plan for unpleasant situations such as these is critical if you want to escape them unharmed. A face-to-face confrontation with a person holding a weapon may be the most frightening event of your life. There are steps that you can take to make the situation less dangerous, even if you have no self defense weapons or other tools at your disposal. \n\nFirst, make sure that the situation is inescapable. If you have walked in on a burglary in progress, or have otherwise spotted someone pointing a gun, it doesn''t mean that you should get in the middle of the situation immediately. If the gun is not pointed at you, escape if you feel safe doing so. This is particularly true if the armed assailant hasn''t yet noticed you. If there is a weapon involved, never try to protect any amount of money or property. It''s not worth risking your life to do so. Instead, call 911 as soon as you can, and stay safe.\n\nIf you cannot get away from the assailant holding the weapon, try to stay as calm as you can, even though your heart is racing. Make your moves carefully, avoiding escalating the situation. There is no reason to rush things along at this point. Instead, your strategy should be aimed towards buying yourself time for help to arrive or for the possibility for escape. If you are close enough to get a good view, make a mental note of the perpetrator''s appearance, which can help police catch him if he escapes.\n\nKeep talking to the assailant, letting them know that you are trying to cooperate. Maintain eye contact and try to stall for time. Comply with your armed attacker''s demands for cash, jewelry, or other possessions. Do not try to ''play hero'' unless you have law enforcement training. If you do so, you risk serious physical harm not only to yourself, but also anyone else with a gun trained on them. Do not challenge the perpetrator verbally or physically, or try to grab his weapon from him.\n\nHowever, this advice is not to say that resistance is futile. In some situations, it is absolutely critical to fight back against your attacker. If the main purpose of the perpetrator is violence, rather than a robbery, you must defend yourself in order to escape unharmed. If you are carrying self defense devices, such as a stun gun or a pepper spray canister, use them as soon as you can to put an end to the situation. Before using your self defense product to stop an armed assailant, check the reality of the situation. Are you within range of the aggressor? Can you get a clear shot? If a gun is pointed at you from a distance, you may need to slowly close the gap while talking or pleading with the assailant. If you can, momentarily distract the assailant. Once you see your opportunity, move quickly and confidently to disarm the attacker.\n\n[url]http://www.articlesnatch.com/Article/What-To-Do-If-You-re-Being-Threatened-With-A-Weapon-/957343[/url]\nBy: Bryan Hough', 0, 1, '124.29.242.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6113, 169270),

There are some very interesting specialty bullets out there, but I imagine that they are either very expensive or just unavailable in Pakistan?  This being the case, some good jacketed hollow points are recommended.  A .32 pistol might be a good backup gun, or a good gun for keeping concealed if it is legal for you to do so?  But yes, 9mm would be better.\n\nAbbas - Thanks for allowing the discussion of the thread about armor piercing cartridges.

I am guessing, the culprit is the weighty furniture and a lot can be achieved by simply toning/slimming down the wood a bit. The mount was as good as any Russian/Turkish shotgun. Wood to metal fitting is first class. I can see meticulous attention to detail given by the manufacturer in this regard. There is no rattling if you tighten the forend screw all the way. It might require a tool to open it back up afterwards though. The rubber butt pad is nice and mushy. Just the way I like it. Not too soft and not too hard. The wood has a pleasing grain and finish. Typical of a hand rubbed oil finish that is instantly recognizable. Warm and smooth to touch, reminds me of few things that I should refrain myself from mentioning here. The checkering is deep and impressive. \n\n[b]The Barrel, Receiver and Internals:[/b]\n\nThe barrel is finished in a very nice deep blue (glossy). The bolt handle, bolt, cartridge elevator and trigger are finished in bright chrome. The aluminum receiver is powder coated with extremely uniform finish with no flaws what so ever.\n\nThe bolt is impressively machined. No flaws whatsoever. The bolt slides in the receiver pretty smoothly and the return speed is as good as it gets with positive locking. I can see that the shotgun is provided with massive extractors, another plus in my opinion. There is no rattling of the forend when the bolt locks in place or when it slams back into the chamber.\n\nThe receiver is well machined (CNC). Free of any flaws even though it is provided with dovetails which complicates the design, hats off to DSA for pulling this off and providing this wonderful feature. The barrel to receiver lockup is superb. The rib is centered and runs straight to the muzzle.\n\nThe action bars are also nicely machined. No tooling marks, burrs or anything like that. Each and every part is firmly locked into place with no rattling (an indication of loose tolerances) of any kind.\n\n[b]The Trigger:[/b]\n\nThe trigger is good enough. I did notice a little bit of creep (nothing out of the ordinary) which I am expecting will improve with use. The trigger breaks cleanly with no over travel. The trigger pull is heavy but not by much. No need for a trigger job as it will eventually lighten up with use. Plus the gun isn’t what you would call “thoroughly cleaned” so it’s partially my fault. I should have cleaned all internals before judging anything. Hey! I’m lazy alright! Besides, hard work is great as long as somebody else is doing it. :)\n\n[b]The Math Work:[/b]\n\n1.	Weight: 8.8lbs (told you it’s on a heavier side)\n2.	Rib Width: 8mm\n3.	Trigger Pull: 8.8lbs (do not compare with handgun trigger pulls)\n4.	Trigger Post-Travel: 0mm (Perfecto!)\n5.	Trigger Pre-Travel: 3mm\n6.	Balance Point: right under the bolt handle\n7.	Cylinder Bore Dia: 18mm or 0.709inch\n8.	Choke Dia: IC=17.75mm, M=17.5, F=17.25mm\n9.	Choke Length: 1.75inches\n\n[b]If I could, I would: (At the moment)[/b]\n\n1. lighten the gun up by probably shaving some of the excess wood, also bring the balance point a little towards the muzzle. preferably at barrel/receiver joint.\n\n2. work a little on the trigger if i cannot wait otherwise it will get better on its own with use \neventually.\n\n3. smoothen out the forend screw cause its a pain to take off once fully tighten.\n\n4. work a little on the safety cause its pretty hard to engage and disengage. after playing with it a couple of times, I am expecting that will eventually become soft as per my liking.\n\n5. clean the heck out of the gun. its basically my fault I should removed all the preservative treatment before show casing the gun.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nAll in all a good shotgun that without a shadow of a doubt deserves praise. From purely manufacturing standpoint, I can see that the manufacturer has left no stone unturned (while keeping the cost factor in check) in ensuring the quality that has always been the hallmark of Daudsons Armoury Peshawar.\n\n[b]A little "Gun Porn" is in order I believe:[/b] [i]Kindly excuse my bad photography[/i]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00261.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00265.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00266.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00272.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00285.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]This picture illustrates the wood to metal fit:[/b]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/Image3.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]The bolt:[/b]\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/DSC00277.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Now something special:[/b]\nBottom of the forend\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/IMG_0383.jpg[/img]\n\nRight side of the forend\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/IMG_0385.jpg[/img]\n\nLeft side of the forend\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Autoloader%20Shotgun/IMG_0386.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Next Stop: Range Review[/b]\n\n[b]Regards.[/b]', 0, 1, '58.65.147.234', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6106, 169563),

Salient features are: \n\n[b]So what is the Avenger[/b]?\n\nWell, like other conversion kits, it consists of a whole top-end, i.e. a whole barrel and slide assembly. The interesting thing in this kit, is [b]that it uses a fixed barrel, thus eliminating the tilting barrel setup of the original Browning design[/b], with immediate potential benefits in the accuracy of the pistol. The Avenger is a "Fixed Barrel Conversion" for the M1911 with "[b]Delayed Blowback[/b]" mechanism.\n\nFurthermore: \n\n[b]It also features twin ejection ports[/b], [b]and the user can select the side to which his empties would be thrown out from[/b]. Finally, at the rear of the slide, you can find some low-profile cocking handles. The whole top-end is mounted on the 1911 frame in the standard way, using the slide stop.\n\n\nAnd: \n\n[b]According to the manufacturer[/b]:\n\nThe Avenger is an entirely new handgun action that is different from anything else ever made before! This new action eliminates the problems associated with using a fixed barrel with high power cartridges. The Avenger is not gas operated and in comparison installs easily on the frame and doesn''t suffer from gas operated fouling problems, in fact, the Avenger even works well with lead bullets. [b]The extreme accuracy comes from a match barrel fixed in place with the sighting device, there is simply no movement between the sight and the barre[/b]l. The fixed barrel eliminates the need for the costly gunsmithing required to precision fit a conventional slide and barrel. [b]Installation is so simple you can take the Avenger upper off and put the stock slide on in a matter of minutes.[/b]\n\nWho''s gonna get the first?  ;) \n\nWonder if it would be Taurus compatible?  :rolleyes:[/quote]\nAs usual very nice post AK-47 brother.  :cool:', 0, 1, '119.153.213.228', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6103, 169595),

Thats what i''ve heard that it doesn''t make any noticeable difference in LEAD standard loads like our regular Shaheen for example. However patterns show some improvement for steel shots as steel is hard metal OR for heavy loads especially steel loads like most Americans use on waterfowl these days. Thats why probably Xtrema etc semi''s are also in very much use these. But i wonder why then on clay ranges such as skeet and trap or sporting clays Optimabore and optima chokes are in more use. Regarding that. I''ve heard/read that O/U guns which are in most use at clay, are lighter when made in Optimabore/choke as opposed to semiautos which becomes heavier with Optimabore/choke.\n\nSir Skeeter60, could you or other members throw some detailed light on this issue? Because its a question of weight of the semiauto especially too when switching from a mobilchoke sys to optimachoke sys.

Most of our taxidermists don''t even use the required raw material of even the lowest quality. Their complaint is that they are not paid for their job as per the prevailing standard ... which is quite true ! A shoulder mount of a sheep here in Pakistan is done from RS 2500 to Rs 6000 whereas, the same is done at a price which varies from US$ 500 to US$ 2500 depending on the specie and the quality of the finished work & the reputation of the taxidermist. Most of the famous & busy taxidermist are so heavily booked they accept the order only if you can wait for six months to a year in routine.\nIt may not be out of place to mention here that the modern day''s taxidermy is greatly dependent on very good quality of raw materials like, plastic/thermapore mounts, glass eyes, synthetic ears, nose, mouth, teeth ...etc. and then comes in the professionalism of the taxidermist who must be trained, rather an "expert" in many relevant arts/jobs like, sculpturing, molding, painting, carpentry, welding, stitching/tailoring, mechanical, molding and above all tanning, which is one of the most difficult jobs and many taxidermist don''t even touch the skins for tanning since it has now become a separate industry with introduction of lots of chemicals & techniques. Nowadays, very few taxidermits (big companies) offer facility of tanning at their studios. Whereas, most of them send the skins to expert tanners. The modern art of taxidermy is perhaps the only art which involves a blend & combination of many arts, skills, tools and procedures ! \nOut of many such bad taxidermists in Pakistan, there are just a "few" of them who will do a "less bad job" for you so you may choose any of the followings. However, there is one guy called Waqar in Karachi whose brother lives in Canada so he keeps importing the good quality raw material which has greatly improved the quality of his taxidermy. But obviously, he is expensive than all others. \nSo here are some Pakistani "Stuffers" ! ... (don''t tell them I call them stuffers or they’ll stuff me !!! ...lol)\n\nMr. Azhar 03005140702 - Rawalpindi\nMr. Imdad 03454977145 - Rawalpindi\nMr. Salim 0629255334 - C/O Bahwalpur Zoo\nMr. Waqar - Karachi (will get his number soon)\nMr. Asif & Mr. Atif (will get his number soon) ... they make their own mounts\nMr. Husnain 0333-5153376 - Rawalpindi (just added by Faisal Sb)\n\nHaving said the above, I would love to mention here my favorite taxidermist Mr. Deiter Ochsenbein who is a Swiss Citizen but based in South Africa and owns the "World''s Largest Taxidermy Factory" you can see his work at [url]http://www.highveldtaxidermists.com/[/url] don''t forget to see their corporate video at [url]http://www.highveldtaxidermists.com/videos.html[/url] \nIf you guys want his services let me know so I may fetch you some good discounts since Mr. Ochsenbein is my loyal client.\nI sincerely hope the above information will prove useful !\nPS : After the hunts of my clients are over, I have to take care of their trophies till I ship them abroad. So I personally do the initial process of washing, salting, sterlizing, drying and then the tanning of all my raw skins using some of the best imported chemicals which is very important since the quality of taxidermy depends entirely on good tanning of the skins. However, since this is a very dirty & smelly job I "Have Not" and I "Will Not" offer my services to anyone ! ... because my family hates this job & they are sick & tired of these bad, ugly, stinking skins at my home ...lol', 0, 1, '119.153.134.32', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6108, 169812),

Most of our taxidermists don''t even use the required raw material of even the lowest quality. Their complaint is that they are not paid for their job as per the prevailing standard ... which is quite true ! A shoulder mount of a sheep here in Pakistan is done from RS 2500 to Rs 6000 whereas, the same is done at a price which varies from US$ 500 to US$ 2500 depending on the specie and the quality of the finished work & the reputation of the taxidermist. Most of the famous & busy taxidermist are so heavily booked they accept the order only if you can wait for six months to a year in routine.\nIt may not be out of place to mention here that the modern day''s taxidermy is greatly dependent on very good quality of raw materials like, plastic/thermapore mounts, glass eyes, synthetic ears, nose, mouth, teeth ...etc. and then comes in the professionalism of the taxidermist who must be trained, rather an "expert" in many relevant arts/jobs like, sculpturing, molding, painting, carpentry, welding, stitching/tailoring, mechanical, molding and above all tanning, which is one of the most difficult jobs and many taxidermist don''t even touch the skins for tanning since it has now become a separate industry with introduction of lots of chemicals & techniques. Nowadays, very few taxidermits (big companies) offer facility of tanning at their studios. Whereas, most of them send the skins to expert tanners. The modern art of taxidermy is perhaps the only art which involves a blend & combination of many arts, skills, tools and procedures ! \nOut of many such bad taxidermists in Pakistan, there are just a "few" of them who will do a "less bad job" for you so you may choose any of the followings. However, there is one guy called Waqar in Karachi whose brother lives in Canada so he keeps importing the good quality raw material which has greatly improved the quality of his taxidermy. But obviously, he is expensive than all others. \nSo here are some Pakistani "Stuffers" ! ... (don''t tell them I call them stuffers or they’ll stuff me !!! ...lol)\n\nMr. Azhar 03005140702 - Rawalpindi\nMr. Imdad 03454977145 - Rawalpindi\nMr. Salim 0629255334 - C/O Bahwalpur Zoo\nMr. Waqar - Karachi (will get his number soon)\nMr. Asif & Mr. Atif (will get his number soon) ... they make their own mounts\nMr. Husnain 0333-5153376 - Rawalpindi (just added by Faisal Sb)\n\nHaving said the above, I would love to mention here my favorite taxidermist Mr. Deiter Ochsenbein who is a Swiss Citizen but based in South Africa and owns the "World''s Largest Taxidermy Factory" you can see his work at [url]http://www.highveldtaxidermists.com/[/url] don''t forget to see their corporate video at [url]http://www.highveldtaxidermists.com/videos.html[/url] \nIf you guys want his services let me know so I may fetch you some good discounts since Mr. Ochsenbein is my loyal client.\nI sincerely hope the above information will prove useful !\nPS : After the hunts of my clients are over, I have to take care of their trophies till I ship them abroad. So I personally do the initial process of washing, salting, sanitizing, drying and then the tanning of all my raw skins using some of the best imported chemicals which is very important since the quality of taxidermy depends entirely on good tanning of the skins. However, since this is a very diry & smelly job I "Have Not" and I "Will Not" offer my services to anyone ! ... because my family hate this job & they are sick & tired of the stinking skins at my home ...lol[/quote]\n\nThanks alot uncle for the detailed reply and the information which i couldn''t get from anywhere else ..

I emailed Randy Wakeman of [url=http://www.randywakeman.com]www.randywakeman.com[/url] fame the following, yesterday:\n\nDear Randy Wakeman,  I''m based outside USA (overseas). Could you pls reply to my question ... Is Optima bore/choke sys better than older Mobilchoke sys with regard to patterning (density & uniformity) on 1-1/8 oz LEAD loads (#8 and #4) and 7/8 oz LEAD load (#9, #7.5). These are only cartrg which I normally use here. Also I  use Modified choke only. I''ve a Mobilchoke AL391 Teknys 12gauge and I''m thinking of upgrading it to newer A400 Xplor or Urika2 with Optima Plus (or newer HP) choke sys. But due to lesser weight of a Mobilchoke barrel, I like its handling. Should i upgrade to the ones mentioned if it would really improve patterns on gamebirds. Or will optima choke sys not make any difference with the inputs i use and mentioned above. My priority is bird hunting while skeet shooting is second priority. Please recommend and suggest. Thank you.\n\nANSWER: "No it isn''t! The Optima bore & choke system isn''t better than older Mobil choke system with reg to patterning (density and uniformity) on 1-1/8 oz LEAD loads (#8 and #4) and 7/8 oz LEAD load (# 9, #7.5)." --Randy\n\nThank you. Then why is this optima bore/ choke hype? And under what circumstances (with certain loads etc) does it be of advantage over mobilechoke system?

Blood moving through the horns is cooled by moving air, and then flows back into the body and lowers the animal''s body temperature\n\n \n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/cpr9mx1g/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/6gwt9.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/cq4hxozo/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/6gQqi.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/cq65h1hg/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/6gSVr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nSo in fact everything in nature has a reason ;)', 0, 1, '116.71.218.43', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6144, 170540),

Baikal was not 10/10 in every aspect however we thought since Baikal MP153 is generally considered a good entry level shotgun therefore it is only appropriate that use it as a benchmark for comparison.........and benchmarks are always given max/full marks.\n\none more thing I would like to add that there were many aspects which were superb in DSA shotgun but less than ideal in Baikal and since Baikal MP153 was selected as a performance/quality benchmark we were limited to assigning max marks (10/10) only to DSA in those aspects.\n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\n\n1. Empty hull throw:\n\nEmpty cartridges were consistently thrown farther by DSA Autoloader than Baikal. but since Baikal was the performance benchmark we could only assign 10/10 to DSA.\n\n2. Primer Strikes:\n\nPrimer strikes were more defined and deep in DSA whereas in Baikal they were not so deep/defined.\n\n3. Cycling speed:\n\nCycling speed was much faster in DSA.\n\n5. Cycling feel:\n\nWe barely felt the action cycle in DSA (shows smooth action and high speed) whereas in Baikal we instantly felt that the action is cycling. not a good thing in Baikal.\n\n5. Recoil\n\nThe felt recoil was similar in both shotguns but DSA recoil was more spread out on the shoulder sorta spreading the force applied on to a larger area. a good thing in DSA.\n\n[quote=wasifali89]and moreover..... what were the patterns and other technical measures of the gun ?[/quote]\n\nfor technical measurement, kindly refer to the previous pages of this thread.\n\nabout patterns, there were plenty of charts depicting pattern formations by both DSA and Baikal by the end of the day. quiet a handful actually however we thought its only appropriate that we list the final results for the ease of both poster and reader.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.152.94', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6106, 170593),

Secondly is ease of maintenance..[/quote]\n\nsir in urban combat, especially when one is clearing buildings and tight spaces, handling a full size battle rifle like G3 may be cumbersome and a handgun should be quite handy. yes MP5 will do wonders but unfortunately, MP5s are issued only to officers and the soldiers all carry rifles. and i think (i may be wrong) that handguns should be easier to maintain. all one needs to do is take out a pin/ move a latch and the guns breaks into 4 or 5 pieces, clean it and put it back together and you''re good to go... \n\n@naazer, sir that is what i meant , Government Issue i.e. standard issue, not the soldier.

Seen soldiers and military policemen carrying a mixed assortment of AK-56s, MP5s, and G3. 10-15 years ago, I saw most soldiers (Army) carrying G3''s and AK-56''s. Recently, more and more can be seen carrying MP-5''s. I don''t know the reason for that. But it''s possible that it''s because large stocks of assault rifles have been moved towards troops combating insurgencies because that''s where they''re needed most, and soldiers doing sentry duties in urban areas armed with MP-5''s instead. \nOfficers do not generally carry or are issued rifles/SMGs unless they are on exercise or in a combat zone.

In self defense scenario even better results can be achieved by using Hollow Point (HP) or Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP) bullets. 9MM caliber guns are easily available in different sizes i-e. Subcompact, Compact and Standard size.\n\n[b].45 ACP[/b] is also known for its stopping power as the bullet/projectile has wider diameter/bigger mass thus it creates bigger cavity and bigger wound to neutralize the target with less shots or with the single shot neutralizing the target. All this comes on the cast of limited mag capacity and most of the 1911 come in single stack mag with 8 round capacity. Though few new 1911 style guns are available with double stack mags but the price is of the gun is on the higher side. Over all limited options are available in 1911. \n\n\n[b]Do you CC it? I will be buying it for CC:[/b]\n\n[b]1911 standard[/b] is of 5" barrel all steel built (Frame/Slide) and the use of CC depends on your height and physic. Some people do like to carry 1911s but not that many. It''s good Carry Gun (CG) but CC in our part of the world not that many people CC it. While on the other hand 9MM handguns suits or serve quite well the purpose of CC with higher capacity mags and in very easily cancelable sizes.\n\n\n[b]If you CC it how many reloads do you carry:[/b]\n\nCarry reload/Extra mags is personal preference and need. You have to decide as per your need/threat or easy of CC. In CC normally people prefer one extra mag.\n\n\n[b]Ammo availability and prices:[/b]\n\n[b]9MM:[/b]\n\nAvailability of 9MM ammo is not a problem. Different brand and origin ammo is easily available but now a days ammo prices fluctuate as per market to market. It is also cheaper than .45 ACP rounds. Normally 9MM rounds are in the price range of Rs. 30 to 80 depending on different brands.     \n\n[b].45 ACP:[/b]\n\nAvailability of .45 ACP rounds now a days is not a problem but the price is on the higher side and you never know when the market can go out of stock. But as per current market the availability of this round is not a problem.

It hit my chest and dissapeared and at the same instant my chest was crushed and i could not get any air past my throat.I tried to run to my aunts house but after taking about ten or 15 paces i was completely exhausted already tired by round 1 with this creature.I didnt have the energy to take another step and rested my back against a wall all the time im trying to breath but my chest is crushed.\n\nMy legs gave away and i slid down the wall into a sitting position with my hands on my knees and my vision started to go.\nIt was like turning the brightness down on a old tv the edges of my vision went black and the picture got smaller and smaller and then the small white dot in the middle went black.So there i am sitting there with my eyes open but no vision suddenley my whole life went past me from childhood to that day it was like flicking the pages of a book with an image on each page.thats when i thought im about to die. Thats when i recited the kalimah "Laa ilaaha illallaahu Muhammadur rasoolullaah "\nPraise be to Allah (swt) as soon as i read the kalimah i was released from the grip on my chest and i gasped for air,after several minutes my vision returned and i staggered to my aunts house holding the walls for support and collapsed on my bed which was outside due to it being so hot in the summer.\n\nI awoke the following morning and a doctor was examining me he said i had some type of indigestion(lol) and i had a deap fear inside me that if i told anyone i would not survive my chest hurt a lot and i did not tell anyone about what happened.when i got back to the uk i started to catch glimpses of the same creature following me but as soon as i looked it would dissapear.at first i tried to ignore it but this kept on happening for about a year and i thought am i going crazy i never used to see stuff like that before,finally i decided to confide in my mother about what happened to me,she was shocked to hear about it and said i was very lucky because other people had been attacked by jinn in the same place and had either died or gone mad.\n\nThis thing followed me for 3 years until i went to pakistan where i had saab done by 3 different people (they use date of birth and mothers name to work your taqdir),all 3 said that a female jinn was in love with me and one of the 3 gave me a taweez and a bottle of water which he had recited quran on,he told me to make ablution with the water when i got home to the uk before i went to bed and that the jinn would appear in a dream and i would be able to ask it questions,he said the jinn was female and was in love with me and that if i did not get it treated that when i got married it would sit in the nikkah and i would never get rid of it and it would harm my wife.\n\nAfter wearing the taweez i never saw it again but i never got to try the water because on the day i ariived at home a visitor who was a little girl about 3 years old opened my luggage and picked up the bottle and emptied its contents over the carpet.I think its possible that the jinn made the little girl spill the water.', 0, 1, '94.169.12.81', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6157, 170921),

Baikal was not 10/10 in every aspect however we thought since Baikal MP153 is generally considered a good entry level shotgun therefore it is only appropriate that use it as a benchmark for comparison.........and benchmarks are always given max/full marks.\n\none more thing I would like to add that there were many aspects which were superb in DSA shotgun but less than ideal in Baikal and since Baikal MP153 was selected as a performance/quality benchmark we were limited to assigning max marks (10/10) only to DSA in those aspects.\n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\n\n1. Empty hull throw:\n\nEmpty cartridges were consistently thrown farther by DSA Autoloader than Baikal. but since Baikal was the performance benchmark we could only assign 10/10 to DSA.\n\n2. Primer Strikes:\n\nPrimer strikes were more defined and deep in DSA whereas in Baikal they were not so deep/defined.\n\n3. Cycling speed:\n\nCycling speed was much faster in DSA.\n\n5. Cycling feel:\n\nWe barely felt the action cycle in DSA (shows smooth action and high speed) whereas in Baikal we instantly felt that the action is cycling. not a good thing in Baikal.\n\n5. Recoil\n\nThe felt recoil was similar in both shotguns but DSA recoil was more spread out on the shoulder sorta spreading the force applied on to a larger area. a good thing in DSA.\n\n[quote=wasifali89]and moreover..... what were the patterns and other technical measures of the gun ?[/quote]\n\nfor technical measurement, kindly refer to the previous pages of this thread.\n\nabout patterns, there were plenty of charts depicting pattern formations by both DSA and Baikal by the end of the day. quiet a handful actually however we thought its only appropriate that we list the final results for the ease of both poster and reader.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\n12 Gauge appreciate the detailed review of this fantastic Pakistani weapon. I just have a small point to which I want to draw your attention.  \n\nAgreed you used the baikal as a benchmark, but this does not mean that you can not give more than 10 to DSA gun. Let say if you were comparing a top of the line Italian gun with baikal as a bench mark then as per your assessment sheet both will get the same marks and that will definitely be injustice with the Italian one. \n\nYou should have given more points to DSA where the it excelled. As per your assessment DSA exceeded baikal in Empty hull throw, Primer Strikes, Cycling speed, Cycling feel and Recoil. If you would have given more score to DSA where it excelled, we would have seen that it was not 93% of baikal rather 100% or more of baikal.\n\nRegards', 0, 1, '119.154.34.129', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6106, 170973),

I adore it, love it and sleep with it under my pillow.\n\nI had been looking for a subcompact for quite a while and the only decent option that I had was the Glock26 which I was reluctant to purchase because of the idiotic price of 350k. Then the Rami came along and ''shot'' the 26 a new one. \n\nThis gun is simply marvelous, it is solid, well finished and a joy to handle. I bought the D version which comes with a decocker and Tritium night sights. The magazine holds 10 rounds and with 1 in the chamber, the gun carries 11. It comes with a firing pin block and the trigger is above average. Barrel length is 3 inches and the Rami weighs 695g which is about 140g heavier than the Glock 26. The pistol is DA/SA.\n\nShooting the Rami is a real pleasure, the felt recoil is quite low for a gun with a 3 inch barrel, the rubber grips feel great and shooting it even with the two and a half finger grip is very comfortable. \n\nAs for accuracy, within the first 50 rounds I shot a two inch group at 10 M. That is just phenomenal for a sub compact. I was so amazed that I forgot about the review and started a one on one competition with it and the Canik 55. At 15 M I shot a 3.5 inch group with the Canik and a 3 inch one with the Rami ! I was almost embarrassed to be shooting better on a gun I had not even fired 100 shots on compared to one (with a 4.7 inch barrel) that I shot 6000+ on.\n\nThen I started to torture test it with limp wrists, rapid fires, loose grip, double taps, dirty ammo etc. It passed all with flying colors, NO FTE''s or FTF. \n\nI fired a total of 300 rounds though it of all kinds of ammo and it ate up everything flawlessly. My main concern was that since this is a subcompact and meant for self defense carry, compatibility with all kinds of HP ammo was a must. I am happy to report that it shot every variety of HP''s I fed it reliably.\n\nThe Rami is a wonderful wonderful piece and I would also like to say while Glocks are great friends, CZ''s are simply life long love affairs. Get one.\n\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami6.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami3.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami4.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rami7.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '119.154.78.225', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6168, 171128),

They hardly took any duck and we ever crossed double figure. They always shift to our place next time and we deployed our spread to another place, however, results never changed. I am taking about SATOOKI marshes still rich with ducks. Same happened at sundar where there was a huge number of hunters with full assessories but we never let them won ever. I shared valuable spots in post "Sites near lahore" ducks in excellent number are still available at mentioned spots. Its upto u now to get your share. \nRangpur is a very poor choice for small team for several reasons so forget about it. I was a frequent visitor of the area and always find 50+ parties wondering around and going back empty hands of with a few coots after spending 2 days and enough money.

Also, it has a slim profile and most people find it quite easy to cc it. But there are some disadvantages. First of, it is very dangerous to carry a TT chambered-cocked or not. Secondly the mag capacity is very low (7-8) rounds and even though there are some double stacked TT around, I would still opt for a modern 9millimeter or .45. But other than that, the TT round does pack a punch! It depends on the user.\n\n[b]is there stopping power good?[/b]\n\nThe 7.62 by 25mm round (.30 bore) is surprisingly very powerful! It is known to pierce type II body armor (which can stop a .45) I think the bullet''s unique bottleneck profile helps but i''m not sure about that. In other words, this gun has amazing stopping power.\n\n[b]is it accurate in long range shots?[/b]\n\nAs for accuracy, I find this gun fairly accurate. Plus it depends on model and make. Obviously a Zastava M57 would be more accurate than a cheap (build quality) Pakistani clone but it all depends on quality-some darra clones might be more accurate than a Russian TT! Also the recoil is a between a 9mil and a .45 so i still find my 9mm wayyy more accurate than the TT\n\n[b]is it a durable gun over call?[/b] \n\nYes! The Tokarev is known for its reliability but that again comes down to build quality. Since it''s design was largely taken from the 1911 series, this gun is very reliable.\n\n[b]which is more effective?[/b]\n.30 bore \n.45 \n.50 \n\nI would go with the .45 ACP for its power/punch but the .30 would be my second option. There are two .50 cal bullets. One used in sniper rifles like the M82 or heavy machine guns like the M2 browning and the second like in the desert eagle. If your referring to the desert eagle one, i believe that it is not pragmatic at all. Just used for showing off or collection or whatever.

Only use the center point of your finger tip vs. 1st joint of finger on the trigger for pressing it straight backwards. \n\nAnd once again dont forget your natural grip contant in pressure from all angles over the pistol grip.. dont use too much thumb(explicit use of thumb) or extra pressurizing on front strap of your pistol grip.\n\nAnd again... the biggest factor... follow through... pls ... very very important... can bring any kind of error or give you all sorts of funny point of impacts if you over look it.

In my unit it has always been the revolver for all officers. \nThe authorization of weapons in a unit is as per it''s manpower authorization, and officers are authorized revolver/pistol and not G3 or AK 47, however as I earlier said, in many units MP5s have been issued to officers in lieu of revolvers/pistols.\nHouse to House clearance is not part of Pakistan army operations, and that is a recent phenomenon that has now been introduced in the army after facing the insurgency in tribal areas. PAKISTAN Army operations earlier were restricted in plains, desert or mountains, where G3 is a very effective weapon and much better then MP5 because of MP5''s limited range and accuracy in comparison with G3.\nInsurgency in the tribal areas is a different phenomenon then war, and since it involves different pattern of fighting with house to house clearance as well, therefore Chinese Aks have been issued to the army, and otherwise the army units do not have the Chinese Aks anymore, as these were given to Police etc by the army.\nPersonally speaking I have never found Mp5 to be a very good weapon, even the noise it produces after a fire compared to G3 is like a motorcycle compared to a truck. MP5 has to let the enemy come as close as 25 meters to be effective, where as G3 can be a sure and accurate kill at 400 meters. In Automatic fire you can litaraly see the bullets leave MP 5 and hit the target at a short distance, but G3 is deadly u can not see it''s bullets as they have a very high velocity.   \nG3 is a very effective and deadly weapon, but if we have to know the best rifle in the world then it will be AK 47 or M16A2', 0, 1, '115.186.118.132', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3089, 171411),

Best to avoid them as much as you can. It''s not ''fun'' or ''cool''.\n\n(2)  Muslims should read the standard prayers to guard against their harm as some have mentioned: ayat-ul kursi, surah falak, surah naas; do the azaan loudly in the room where you feel there is a presence; stay in wudhu especially when going to sleep. These are powerful protectors and you must not underestimate their potential. Key is one should have a lifestyle that reflects islam and sunnah in every way - we shouldn''t just read a few duas to get rid of jinn, jadoo, nazar etc and expect good results based on that alone.\n\nI thought the post about using jinns to make electricity was funny but interesting.

The good jinns are allowed to move freely amongst people, but dont anger them. I as a human being am not scared of them, but i do respect them.

Anyway....\n\nI have had more than Jinns to deal with....By the way, they live way over 100 years and are intelligent and highly knowledgeable. There are more Hafiz Jinns than Humans. But enough about Jinns.\n\nWe lived, for about a year (for obvious reasons) in a real haunted house in Kathmandu, Nepal. It was a huge single story house, with three huge bedrooms, Drawing Room, Huge Dining, Lounge, Kitchen, Store etc... with the front lawn big enough for playing football. The backyard was a small but a very thick forest, full of holes...snake holes..The car garage also had a lot of snake holes. There were all kinds of anakes in there, mostly huge pythons. You should see em eat small animals....what a scary sight...\n\n\nAnyways, one day the electric meter checker came home and dad was not available. So I was asked to let him in in the meter room adjacent to the unused servant quarters near the front gate. The outside wall was completely covered by a vine like variety of roses. The inside was really spooky, dusty and haunted like. It was like it was never inhabited. At that time, I never wondered why our servants did not live in the free quarters. Anyways, after the meter reader left, i started snooping around the old dusty place and saw something sticking out of the dust carpet on the floor. I moved the dust with my hand to uncover a very old coin. I removed more dirt and dug out a small metal box full of coins. I took them home and washed the coins. They were really old coins. Our maid, we used to call her "Mali Ki Patni" :P  . She was a very old lady, around 80 and was the only one allowed inside the house. When she saw the coins, she told me that these were old and discontinued coins and totally worthless...( I did not know anything about collectibles then...I was a wild 9 year old guy then. When I told her where I got em,,she freaked out and told me never ever to go there again. Meter room is the limit. Do not venture any further and come out. But of course, wild that I was, I would not agree unless she gave me a good reason. So in brief, she told me, that the house was a haunted house and a lot of Gurkha Spirits live there. If we distub them, then they will hurt us. She told me that the ground on which the house was built was part of the Gurkha Army Training Center a long time ago. Whenever a gorkha would commit a serious offence, he would be buried alive. Normally, when hindus die, they are burned in Shamshan Ghat near Pashupati Nath Temple. \n\nSo in short, the property was haunted by spirits of the bad Gorkhas who were buried alive!\n\nI told mom and dad and they did some verifications. It was all true and guess what; we found out that the land lady did not have any children and was a widow. She was living in a very old hut adjacent to our house!!! The house was vacant for many years until we came along. A lot of things happened during out stay there and my entire family was afected.....\n\nToday, i will just tell you one story...\n\nOne fine day, dad was in office and my mom got a call from a Pakistani friend who used to live nearby. She took my older sisters with her to visit her friend and left me with my youngest sister (at that time, she was the youngest, till our born in Nepal sister came along). She told me that she will be back in time to make lunch and asked me to let Mali Ki Patni inside and tell her to wait till my mom came back...\n\nNow after a while, me and my little sister got tired of playing and got bored. Then after a while, my little sister, she was just 3 or 4 years old, started whining for food as she was hungry. I assured her that mom will be home soon and make us lunch. But she started to give me a headache and began whining and crying. I was wondering what should I do. That was 1975 and we did not have a freezer and no stored cooked food. I thought may be I will go into the kitchen and find something like carrots and stuff we can eat raw. I barely got up when I heard some sounds from the kitchen. It was as if the water was running in the sink...someone working n the kitchen. But I remembered, since mom and sisters had gone away, I was a bit scared and had shut down all the doors and windows before we started playing. The only possibility was Mali Ki Patni who used to enter from the kitchen door. But I had locked the door!\n\nI did not know what to do. My sister was really getting on my nerves and I was scared like hell. Didn''t have the guts to go into the kitchen to find out who was there. Then suddenly, I got an idea. Why not call out and find out. \n\nStill trembling with fear, I called out, who is there?...is that you Mali Ki Patni? \n\nSuddenly, there was silence in the kitchen, but no reply. \n\nNow I was really scared and took my sister in our bedroom..bolted it from inside and waited for mom, always looking out the window to keep an eye on what was going on. Then I started hearing noises from the kitchen again. Whoever it was, was again at whatever it was doing....That day was one of the scariest days of my life. I am glad I was a kid, not weak of hear that I am now. \n\nAfter about half an hour, the house was filled with the scent of freshly cooked hot food. And guess what, It was our favorite. Khichdi and fried potato chips. Now I was sure it was Mali Ki Patni. Then The noises ceased and I heard the door shut. That is when I ran into the kitchen and there it was on the stove.... \n\nKhichdi cooked in the biggest pot in the house and a frying pan full of potato chips. We both had our fill and my sister was her good playful self again. Thanks god.\n\nAfter a while, mom and my older sisters came back. Mom immediately smelled the food and rushed to the kitchen. She asked me why did I cook so much khichdi and I told her that I didn''t. It was Mali ki Patni. Mom told me that she had asked me to tell Mali Ki Patni to wait till she came back. I told her that I did not see her come in or leave. She must have come in from the kitchen door, like she always does and left from the same door. My mom looked at the kitche door and it was bolted shut from inside!\n\nThat is when she really got mad at me for lying to her. I got a good hearing from her and then from dad when he came back from office. Later, Mali Ki Patni confirmed that she did not come to our house earlier. \n\nTo this date, I have not been able to figure out who make our food...... \n\nA Jinn??? or \n\nA bad Gorkha Spitrit who was buried alive as punishment??????\n\nSpooky isn''t it?', 0, 1, '115.167.96.62', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6157, 171489),

I have narrowed down my search to .308 /30-06 or a 7mm. After a lot of search on net, Remington 700 or t3 sounds promising but availability is a major issue. As for the scope, I already have a zeiss 4x12-50 and a Nikon 6x18-50. I have got the mounts as well but having a scope before the rifle is like having the ingredients of pizza without the dough.

Thats what i''ve heard that it doesn''t make any noticeable difference in LEAD standard loads like our regular Shaheen for example. However patterns show some improvement for steel shots as steel is hard metal OR for heavy loads especially steel loads like most Americans use on waterfowl these days. Thats why probably Xtrema etc semi''s are also in very much use these. But i wonder why then on clay ranges such as skeet and trap or sporting clays Optimabore and optima chokes are in more use. Regarding that. I''ve heard/read that O/U guns which are in most use at clay, are lighter when made in Optimabore/choke as opposed to semiautos which becomes heavier with Optimabore/choke.\n\nSir Skeeter60, could you or other members throw some detailed light on this issue? Because its a question of weight of the semiauto especially too when switching from a mobilchoke sys to optimachoke sys. Optima guns are much heavier in semiautos such as AL391 Teknys Optima (7.5 to 7.75lbs) vs AL391 Teknys Mobil (7lbs). Looking forward to your views....[/quote]\n\nI did not know there is a weight difference caused because of the chokes, you have mentioned the difference is about .25 pounds, sometimes irrespective of the choke there is more than .25 lbs difference because of different wood densities. If you think weight is important, I am with you as one carries the gun all day to shoot it 25 or more times if  lucky on a shooting trip, I would suggest getting a 26 inch barrel it handles well and is considerably lighter. The Technys uses some what smaller and stream lined working parts which makes it lighter. Also be care ful the STONE COAT starts to peel off.

(Make sure you have a good back stop and be safe.) Next, find the centre of the group, and adjust the sights accordingly. If the sight is moved to the left, the point of impact will move to the left. If the sight is moved down, the point of impact will move down, and so forth. Once the group is reasonably centered on the target, place a new paper target at the distance you actually want to sight-in your air gun and repeat the procedure.

But for now I am assuming that you are talking about a standard springer with one piston. \nYou should:\n1: Do lots and lots of practice before you try to take a life, zero your gun and then do some more practice until you can do what point 2 requires.\n2: If you can not hit a 1 inch diameter object at 25 yards continuously, you are not ready to hunt.\n3: Use the same brand of pellets and retune your gun if you change the brand and/or the batch of pellets you use.\n4: If you are not firing a PCP (which I assume is the case), you should not practice while resting your gun on something (a support) because in the field when you shoot at your aim while hunting, you will probably not have that support. Besides, springers are not recommended to be fired with a bi-pod or other supports like that. They should be fired with your bare hands because of the recoil they produce. This recoil is absorbed by the flexibility in your arms.\n5. Do not pull the trigger. Squeeze it.\n6. Know your heart!!!!! You will notice that snipers know their breathing pattern and their heart beat. Roughly aim at your target, then take 5/6 quick breaths to get enough oxygen in your blood, during this process you should be starting to aim at your target accurately but you will see that your rifle moves up and down with your breathing movement (i know it can be hard to notice). After these 5/6 breaths, stop breathing and aim accurately WITHIN NEXT 6 seconds or so and SQUEEZE the trigger. If you have missed this window, and your body runs out of oxygen, your heart will pump harder, so you should repeat the cycle again. (dont worry, you will eventually get it right)\n7. Know your quarry, its vital areas, and what "it" will do once hit. And shoot to kill in ONE LETHAL shot. A good hunter always respects his quarry, even when dead. So please dont aim to injur, aim to kill.\n8. Say a little prayer for me when you are eating and enjoying a successful kill :))\n\nI have been hunting quite large rabbits with airguns. The largest one I killed (ofcourse in one shot) was 3.2 killos. Almost all of these rabbits were killed with head shots except where I made a mistake and hit the neck or another area. This is just to re-emphasize point 7. But the best advice is "practice makes perfect" and please brother whatever you do, do not use a live animal/bird for your "practice".', 0, 1, '139.181.208.34', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6179, 171632),

Well, still that does not close the argument ...the 0.5 lbs heavier Optimabore/optimachoke semiauto shotgun OR Mobilechoke semiauto ....it  leaves the argument still OPEN ENDED.  25% improvement in larger loads or 15% improvement in smaller loads is again a personal thought @Mian-50 - an opinion - not an established fact with proof or results. I checked my friend''s Teknys AL391 Optimachoke gun yesterday and compared the result on paper at 30 yds and 35 yds to my gun (variables same such as same std Shaheen cartridge and same choke constriction in both guns) - NO major improvements were seen in Optimachoke barrel patterns over my mobilchoke''s. Therefore, I am now thinking about a newer thing - an extended Beretta Victory OR Trulock Precision Hunter choke (Skeet2 i.e. Light Mod) on my mobilchoke gun for skeet and ducks/partridges, as I wrote to George Trulock too. He replied if my shooting was in the max 30-35 yds range, I should consider an extended "Light Mod" choke, and if it was in the 35-40 yds max range, I shoud consider extended "Mod" choke. I have heard and also read from Randy Wakemen''s columns that "Trulock Precision Hunter" choke is one of the world''s best gamebird patterning chokes. I still do not know how an extended choke would improve my patterns over a flush mobil choke, yet I am going for it because I feel that the 0.5 lbs heavier  Optimachoke AL391 Teknys guns are of no special use bec of heavier Optimabore barrels.\n\n@Skeeter60 sir! I have used this stonecoat for three years plus and fired 8 cartons per year on hunting and some clay shooting (limited, only for pre-season practice) but so far the finish is OK as was supplied (I am a fanatic when it comes to gun cleaning and care), though corrosive rust removers like WD40 and even Brunox or Promax are harmful for titanium coating (Stonecoat) as well as on standard black bluing on other guns. Wiping the dust/moisture with supplied Beretta gun-oil or Hoppe''s oil etc takes care of durability of the outer finish, whatever it is - std bluing or titanium coating. It is not recommended to use a corrosive rust remover or even rust preventer + oil formula sprays as usually mistris and hunters say.', 0, 1, '58.27.148.214', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6128, 171723),

It will be good from chinkara to NeelGai and every thiing in between.\nHornady has made ammunition which they call as 30-06 Light Magnum this ammo gives higher velocities and closes the gap between the 30-06 and the 300 Winchester Magnum.\n ( Remember use only one type and make of ammo ,when you change ammo you have to re zero your rifle )   Sometimes cheap military ammo is available which can be used for practice.\n     Another good cartridge is the 270 Winchester, it is also good and has similar ballistics but its most useful bullet is the 130 grain one; it has a 140 and a 150 grain bullet also but these lose their velocity and trajectory advantage relatively. There are lighter bullets like the 120 and 90 grains but these are not accurate in all rifles and are varmint bullets not to be used on any thing bigger than a Chinkara. Again I find it is better to use a heavy ,harder and some what slower bullet on smaller animals as these cause less meat destruction.\n7mm or the 7x57\nThe 7mm is the first modern cartridge and almost all the popular cartridges like the 30-06 the 270 etc were spawned from this cartridge. It is a very good cartridge and popular even today after almost 120 years or so, bullets fro 140 grain to 175 grains can be used and with high sectional densities and ballistic coefficient this bullet is effective on all game with proper bullet selection. It has softer recoil, I consider the felt recoil of the 30-06,the 270 and the 7mm Magnum to be the same; if you blind fold some one and make him fire the three calibers I do not think one can tell one from the other.\n\nThe 7mm Magnum\nAnother popular cartridge with a great range of bullets, popular ones are from 140  to 175 grains; it gives higher Muzzle velocities and excellent trajectories and wind deflection at long ranges is minimal, it is my favourite and I prefer it for real long range shooting up in the mountains.\nAmmunition is expansive , the cheaper ammo is 7mm as it is supposed to have minimal tax on ammo import on it (Late FM Ayub Khan ) had passed the rule that 7mm Rifles and ammo to be nearly Tax free so it is still cheaper than most.\nYou have good scopes, but I would request for hunting you should have minimal power on zoom scopes like 2x to 8x or   or 3 to 10 or so, a scope with a minimum power of 6 will give you very little field of view and it will be impossible to take running shots and close shots with this power.

There are quiet a few types of rotts in the world sir. German (the most authentic ones) are short, stockiers, more muscular, big heads and wider jaws, but shorter faces. American rotts are tall, not so muscular, straight hind legs, the jaw is narrower and the muzzle is slightly longer. Russains are bulkier, taller, have long fur, no muzzle measurement has been stardardised. \nAfter our little conversation here i too, sat on the net, and searched around. It was an addition to my knowledge and maybe would add to other peoples knowledge, that for the last 3 - 4 years, russian breeders have been trying to breed a rott, that would be easier to train, would be stronger, with a bigger bone structure and a manageable temper. So they have been buying and mating pedigreed sires and dames (from elite, +A1 grade bloodlines) from all over the world. Therefore different but pedigreed rotts are now availble from russia. \nPedigree puppy food is okaye, but do remember sir, this food was primarily devolped for dogs in cooler climates, a dogs normal body temperature is around 101 - 102 degrees C. Therefore i donot condone dogfood, but i do advice, that you give him half half. Whatever measure of food, is given on the packet of dogfood, weigh that, add half the quantity of meat (mince, botis) and the other half of dogfood. Best meats for a dogs are, the meat from the cheek (kulla), liver (kullegi, load of protiens, to be given after one year of age), heart (dil), in winters a paya soup, with ataye kee roti, makes for good shiny fur, prevention of joint problems. \nOnce again i apologise for reacting fast, with asking the origins. I do belive it to be a pure bred puppy. Thanks to you and your puppy, i gained some good knowledge about what happening in the rotty world. Hope the advice above comes in handy to you and your pup. \nRegards,\nP.s: I  have seen alot of master an pets look alike pics, but the joint problems of a dog are normally heiridity. I would want to get into that disscussion with you ;)  :lol:', 0, 1, '115.186.72.177', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 779, 171978),

I could clearly tell by the sound someone climbing stairs then walking in different rooms. \n\nthen in a matter of few days strange thing started to happen. while sleeping, I would wake with my eyes fully open i could see, hear but wanst able to move. I used to see a black shadow floating just above me. I wanted to scream but it felt as if someone is holding all my nerves. I could not even move a muscle. I always used to have this suffocating feeling just like explained by Jagga bro.  Then after a few minutes it would just go away leaving me scared and shaking. Many times I told my parents but they took it lightly. Then it started happening every night. I even tried to fight this thing off but all i could move were my eyes.\n\nOnce I was walking in the village and some villagers told me that they have often seen someone walking on the roof at night. The next day i left that house for good and started living at nanas house and it never ever happened again to this day. \n\nAfter going through Jaggas story, I now come to the conclusion that may be it was also some kind of frustrated female spirit who dint get much lift from her own kind so she tried her love on me. \n\nMay Allah keep all of us safe from these types of bad experiences.

There are quiet a few types of rotts in the world sir. German (the most authentic ones) are short, stockiers, more muscular, big heads and wider jaws, but shorter faces. American rotts are tall, not so muscular, straight hind legs, the jaw is narrower and the muzzle is slightly longer. Russains are bulkier, taller, have long fur, no muzzle measurement has been stardardised. \nAfter our little conversation here i too, sat on the net, and searched around. It was an addition to my knowledge and maybe would add to other peoples knowledge, that for the last 3 - 4 years, russian breeders have been trying to breed a rott, that would be easier to train, would be stronger, with a bigger bone structure and a manageable temper. So they have been buying and mating pedigreed sires and dames (from elite, +A1 grade bloodlines) from all over the world. Therefore different but pedigreed rotts are now availble from russia. \nPedigree puppy food is okaye, but do remember sir, this food was primarily devolped for dogs in cooler climates, a dogs normal body temperature is around 101 - 102 degrees C. Therefore i donot condone dogfood, but i do advice, that you give him half half. Whatever measure of food, is given on the packet of dogfood, weigh that, add half the quantity of meat (mince, botis) and the other half of dogfood. Best meats for a dogs are, the meat from the cheek (kulla), liver (kullegi, load of protiens, to be given after one year of age), heart (dil), in winters a paya soup, with ataye kee roti, makes for good shiny fur, prevention of joint problems. \nOnce again i apologise for reacting fast, with asking the origins. I do belive it to be a pure bred puppy. Thanks to you and your puppy, i gained some good knowledge about what happening in the rotty world. Hope the advice above comes in handy to you and your pup. \nRegards,\nP.s: I  have seen alot of master an pets look alike pics, but the joint problems of a dog are normally heiridity. I would want to get into that disscussion with you ;)  :lol:[/quote]\n\nThanks a lot Fahad bro, yes it looks newer Russian breed as was imported from there.\n\nThanks for the precious advise on food will certainly try to maintain the balance.\n\nJoint problem; can you believe me and my old dog had been taking same medicines (mainly pain killers & antacids) for some time  ;)', 0, 1, '119.157.117.231', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 779, 172082),

Here goes something sober/serious again.....\n\nLike I told you about the house, it was a very well built/expensive house rented out to us on very reasonable amount. At first, we thought we were lucky to be getting a dream house for peanuts....anyways   :rolleyes: \n\nOne of the features of this house was that it was designed for the cold weather in Nepal. Temperatures go below 0 a lot and water in the taps sometimes gets frozen. It was also quite windy. The wind chill could easily give you hypothermia and kill you if you are not wearing protective clothing. So, the house had to be able to protect against the extreme cold ( extreme for at leat us Pakistanis..especially those who live in the south) and at the same time allow maximum sunlight inside.\n\nAfter my parents had realised that there was something seriously wrong about this house, they put us kids in the same bedroom. My elder sister was 11, I was 9, my younger sister was 7 and the youngest one was 3-4 years old. It was a huge bedroom with, like all other rooms, huge glass windows. The windows were made of some kind of aluminium alloy, really thick and heavy, and the glass was also really crystall like and thick, more than a centimeter thick. To keep the air out, it was airtight with rubber like lining on their sides, similar to the one we have in car doors. To shut the window, you really had to use a lot of force to press it against the frame and use a heavy lever to bolt it shut. It was equally painfully difficult to open it. Most of the time, the windows were closed. Only the two side portions of the window could be opened.\n\nIt started one cold night, the temperature was below zero, everything was frozen and the wind was really chilly. We went to bed at around 9pm (very late by their standard). Well, it happens when four noisy troublesome kids are packed into one room...\n\nAnyway, we were all sound asleep and probably having sweet dreams. Suddenly, we heard a loud bang and woke up really startled ..........\n\nin a shock!\n\nSuddenly .... \n\nall the chilly wind was blowing inside our room....\n\nlike a snow storm....\n\nminus the snow.....\n\nreally dry and chilly....\n\nThen there was another loud BANG!...\n\nand lo....\n\nANOTHER window opened up and slammed hard against the wall  !!\n\nThen we realised what had happened.... \n\nboth the windows, \n\none by one... \n\nhad their heavy lever like bolts opened and the windows slammed open against the walls!!\n\nFor a while...\n\nwe were all speechless.....\n\nshivering.....\n\nholding on to our razais...\n\nand looking at each other....\n\nBEWILDERED!!!!.....\n\nThen my elder sister came to her senses and guess what....\n\nI was suddenly supposed to be the man in the room and was ordered to shut down the windows or else.....\n\nSuddenly, I visualised my elder sister''s sledge hammer hands all over my face and decided....\n\nnothing could be worse than that....\n\nScared as I was....\n\nwith my little hands trembling...\n\nI was really shivering.....\n\nI started to shut down the first window. It was difficult. The wind was really furious at me for denying it entry in our room...\n\nIt resisted with all its might but I would not budge...\n\nor else it were the sledge hammer hands all over my pummeled face....\n\nso I used all the strength I had and managed to shut one window.\n\nNow I turned to another window and guess what.... \n\nmy hands stopped working!!!! \n\nThey were FROZEN!!!!!! \n\nAnd I was in real agony...... \n\nBut my sister was such a cruel and brutal enemy of mine....\n\nshe thought I was just making an excuse. But my little sisters...\n\nalso her victims but much better off then me.....\n\nstarted massaging my hands and in a while...\n\nI was able to get to work again..\n\nNow the wind was even more furious....\n\nThis was the only way in left for it and I was closing it....\n\nIt really put up a fight but I was really determined....\n\nIt was really difficult but I used all the strength I had and even more....\n\nI don''t know how I got that strength but after a brave struggle....I managed to shut the window.\n\nI was exhausted and my hands frozen and hurting ... I could even feel my bone KULFI!!!!!!......\n\nIn the morning, we told our parents what had happened and they convinced us with a cock and bull story about air pressure...\n\nextreme cold...etc. plain bullshit. \n\nPerplexed and confused....\n\nwe just accepted the explanation we did not understand and just shut up. Little did we know that my parents were alrady trying to find us another house to rent. \n\nBut while we stayed in that house,,,,,\n\nthis happened around two/three times in a week. \n\nTo this date, I don''t know who was doing this and why? \n\nWas it a Jinn ???\n\nor the spirit of a bad Gorkha buried ALIVE??!!!!!\n\nNow my question for everyone is, \n\nand I want you all to give an honest answer......\n\nWas I brave or was my elder sister scarier than a Jinnn and the Spirit of a bad Gorkha buried ALIVE?\n\nI WILL BE BACK.

It has a recoil pad system which is called the Gel-Tek pad which reduces the recoil by almost 25% as compared to any other shotgun which has got a conventional recoil pad.\n\nI have Shot couple of thousand round from this shotgun in every kind of hunting shoots like Quail , Partridge, Sand grouse, Duck and many other Hunts (allah ka shukar hay) I have not even ONCE experienced any kind of MALFUNCTION and it is very comfortable to shoot, specially when I shoulder the gun it  feels more livelier very durable as uptil now what I have seen in my short hunting carrier it is a gun made for high volume shooting and one more very distinctive characteristic is it handles the most variety of ammo loads starting from 24g to 55g without changing any part or any spring.\n\nLarge number of shot gunners consider the A390 the finest autoloader ever built by Beretta, but though it is a very good shotgun, but I believe a further improved version of that gun called the AL391 Teknys, which was introduced in 2002, is even better. It may not be better mechanically but it is much more refined and improved and meets all the requirement of the shooter standing in hunting field.\n\nAs far as I am considered the ONLY drawback in semi-auto’s is cleaning system, it takes at least half an hour for a person like me to clean the gun coz its Piston gets very dirty even after 25 shots.\n\nBeretta shotgun comes in a durable plastic storage case along with accessories such as four extra chokes and wrench, quick-detachable sling swivels, a bottle of Beretta oil, and, depending on the model, a spare butt plate or recoil pad.\n\n[b]Approximately:[/b] the price of this shotgun falls between Rs 200k to 240k (depending on a dealer to dealer or whether in Lahore and Karachi because Karachi is approximately 15 to 20k more expensive than Lahore \nAL 391 teknys Stone coat is just simply the BEST!

Above everything, the decoys crack from below due to inferior (thin) plastic after few uses. For the price vs quality both are down. At least thats the experience since last 5 or more years of our few friends incl myself. Best quality decoys are made in Sahiwal local stuff. I got 80 decoys recently and they are very tough. But slight work needs to be done on then reg paint refinement. I conveyed the person my tips and views on that color perfection, but you see when you add MATTE durable lacquer with thinner paint etc, and do fine paint work that has to be done via spray paint like car paint and deco furniture paint process, not by hand, hence it is a bit costlier. However i advised the concerned person to do it and add some premium to the price like Rs100 a piece and i am sure hunters are going to buy. At least i would if those variables can be mastered. He said he would get back to me after perfecting newer better colors. Hopefully they will shortly. Apart from  that, i think imported ones USA are great and cheap too if imported. But i don''t know what custom do they charge on them on a dozen decoys. If you have that info, pls enlighten us.[/quote]\n@Haier, I have already posted about this low quality supplier ...the decoys which he says as imported are NOT imported, they are same cheap made local stuff. He has only painted shiny paint on them (Shovelers only till now) and is trying to dodge people by saying they are Chinese & etc etc. The decoys have to have matte finish and durable paint (pref accurate paint too) alongwith rugged plastic used. He is saving on plastic and paint which wears off after 3 or 4 uses. At first sight, though it looks ok. You can try your luck.', 0, 1, '110.36.14.146', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5415, 172265),

We spend 3 nights under a jinn''s jogging track and nothing happened.....\n\n2) A cousin of mine (11-12 years old) was playing in his house in summer afternoon (this was probbaly 1981) in their house in Multan, it was a huge railways house with lots of trees and plantations on all four sides, he peed under a tree......after that he listened some voice.....and dont remember anything after that..........his family members searched for him everywhere but didnt find him at night when all of them were sitting in living room, worried what to do??? he fell through chimney of fire place of living room, unscratched but with blackened clothes... he only remember that after he peed he saw a black shadow coming toward him and after that he knew nothing.....\n\n3) In our acsestral home of lahore, (probably 1970s) jinn or something use to do funny things, as cooked roties found from inside of locked metal trunk when it was opened for winter clothes, someone''s huqqa went missing and found from well, mud and metal pots found twisted (unbroken) as if some one have deshaped, turned, twisted them with hand..... stuff like that... this was before my birth so dont know how they got rid of it,', 0, 1, '203.128.5.198', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6157, 172518),

I was once instructed by Gilani sahib not to even change the cartridges and use them uniformly. I mean the practice should be with that cartridge and gun which we would normall carry or use. Enhancing the skills with these guns and cartridge means real enhancement. Skeeter sahib and Gilani sahib would throw a better light on it....![/quote]\n\nGilani sahab is absolutely right. The gun used for  SD and its ammo should never be changed. As it should be part of your muscle memory and you should be able to use it fumble free when sleepy, tired or wounded or shocked or all combined. \nUnfortunately these are the circumstances under which mostly one could find himself forced to use his gun in SD, if one starts fumbling and decocks his gun thinking he just removed the safety or otherwise the grip angles vary etc, etc, the new ammo you havn''t tried earlier could have a problem. There is on old Western saying " Be ware of the man with One Gun "\nNow the .22 question again I agree that is the best way to train ,it is cheaper and you will learn the basics easily, I would even suggest training with an air pistol.

You folks being the first and unique (perhaps) in Pakistan, I once again want to congragulate you brothers for this opportunity in allowing me to feast my eyes and ears with such interesting topics.\n\nAbout me, I was retired from guns (if there is such a thing).  Well after a while I''m getting to scratch off the flinches and jitters of shooting and am gradually filling my heart and lungs with gunsmoke -- there being nothing better than the pleasure of witnessing "chaos under control" as one of my old friends always said.\n \nI''m a Chuck Taylor disciple (and fan) and adhere to his ideology and principles of defensive/combat/target shooting to the core.  So that shows my concept for guns in their strictest functional sense, which can only [i]then[/i] reveal the gun''s real beauty.\n\nI''m still not used to today''s technology (of forums) and as Mr. Abbas has so explained in detail, but I still fell short of his explanation.  For instance I want the image of the Dan Wesson 1911 pistol (above) to be [i]my[/i] avatar, but I still don''t know how to do so.  Call it a neuron(s) malfunction!  Another is that the following quotes are my "mission statements" (for lack of better words) that best describe me and my profession, but I''m not sure how to post  them as footers for my reply??  \nThankyou all!\n_________________________________\nForm follows Function.

So after long discussions with 12gauge bro decided to go for Hatsan Escort Magnum Combo ( two barrels 22” fixed Cylinder and 26” with 5 mobile chokes one of these is skeet).\n\nGot the one with synthetic furniture as 12guage brother warned not to go for wooden that being prone to go shrunk with the passage of time producing annoying rattle (if it happens).\n\n[u][b].. Love at First Sight ..[/b][/u]\n\nNice, Modern/ high Tech/ Sturdy looking, neat n clean finish, Sleek Profile, perfect size for medium built shooter. My previous shotguns (Mossberg & Browning) are bit big for me to mount but Hatsan Escort is sized just perfect for the majority of shooters from our region me being one of them  ;) \n\nAnd paid 40k for all that.\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/001.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/002.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/010.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/011.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/006.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/017.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[u][b]..

What Hatsan claims .. [/b][/u]\n\n(1)	Escort fast Loading System helps loading shells fast & easy without changing the aiming position… I actually did not find it the way its claimed not sure whether its newbie me or the Hatsan’s  market gimmick. \n\n(2)	Smart Valve Piston: To my experience it performed as advertised, cycled everything down to skeet 24gr loads flawlessly matching the speed of my trigger finger. \n\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/008.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/009.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/005.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[u][b]…Range Review…[/b][/u]\n\n\nWas bit worried about gun’s ability to cycle the lighter skeet loads so just to give my self & the gun confidence I first fired full box of 25 Shaheen number 4 shells at range but without the skeets, all went through the barrel, out from ejection port & fed to chamber flawlessly. Fired two full magazines (7+1) trying my best to defeat the smart n fast piston but in vain.\n\nAfter the hot load test run, put it on 24gr skeet load for continues 45 shots, there was no difference in cycling speed than the hot loads, recoil was milder though. All went flawlessly making me proud Escort owner.\n\nNow the amazing part of the skeet shoot was the accuracy, I hardly been a 50% bird breaker but with Escort I broke 21 skeets out of first 24 (although from the easiest station but I never did that before)…and my immediate decision was to make it my official skeet gun  :D \n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/013.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/012.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/014.jpg[/img]\n\n[u][b]... Shot Spread Pattern ...[/b][/u]\n\nAlso did a basic paper pattern test using Shaheen number 8 shell, with skeet choke, at about 18 yards distance. \nBelow is the picture of the pattern that appeared on the paper and as per brother 12gauge its nicely even spread that does not look like a 40k shotgun pattern.\n\n\n[img]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/Pattern.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[u][b]DISLAIMER:[/b][/u] Everything described above is either my experience with the Escort I purchased or the Hatsan claims.

The last one was the spookiest of em all and was kept as a guest bedroom  ;)  Guests were always welcome.. :P \n\nWell, sounds really wicked, but we had a total of two guests in about one year that we lived there (In that house.....In Nepal, we lived there for nine years! aur bohot kahaniyaan hain doston   ;) ).  :D  I will tell you about their fate later.\n\nThe design is meant to give you an idea of the layout/basic design.

We used to play catch and run around this wall as well as ride our three and four wheelers around it.

This meant I was looking roughly in line at the target and the barrel was a bit to the right of the target.

I used to go out in midnight to check the troops and I never took any guard or sentry along to maintain the  surprise.There was an abandoned mud hut in the area and whenever I walked towards or closer to it, some unrest and sort of strange feelings always occupied me.The moment I was out or away from that place,I used to be normal.I one night asked from me that it is my fear for unknown or the presence of some spirits or ghost.To overcome my fear, one night I got into that hut all alone and found absolutely nothing,soon I was so relaxed.\nBut next night new activity took place.When I reached near hut some bells sounds were heard or to be more precise sounds of ghungroo were heard.Theses sounds were not only heard by me but few othewrs also observed it.\nSoon my duty place was changed but I used to feel sick, my weight started losing and in the mid night my sleep was disturbed by a murmuring sound in my ears.\nI asked my Doctor but he could not give any diagnostic accept for some sleeping pills.After few days I was changed from the area and everything got normal.\n\nSimilar incidents happened in the far flung areas of Zhob where we could find the presence such creatures.Even in my house  a large house built for some old British Officers in Zhob Cantt about some hundred years ago and as an option I had to shift in  along with my small kids and wife because there was no other accomodation available. That house was really an haunted house.There I had some bad memories of  death of my 2 dogs who were killed together and after a month another German Shepherd of mine was found dead  in the morning which I brought from Lahore.\nMy small kids used to feel the presence of "some one" in their rooms.We used to hear the growling sounds under our beds.My wife used to recite Quran when ever such activities were observed and those weird sounds changed into crying and weeping sounds. That house consisted of about 12 rooms and more than half of rooms were never used by any one of us.It was really so horrible that during day hours we were not comfortable to visit those rooms.But every thing went to normal when we were shifted to newly constructed accomodation.\nI dont know whether the  house is still there or has been demolished but I wish to see it once again.I''ll narrate some other experiences of Zhob when I used to be in field.\nThanks for reading.', 0, 1, '115.167.110.151', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6157, 173987),

This is not the main topic of the discussion however. \n\nI have also seen Glocks, Berettas, Colts, and Brownings deformed after certain conditions. This does not make them bad guns.\nI have never said STAY AWAY FROM THE f.... American/Austrian/Italian or Belgian guns. \nI have driven a beautiful Pontiac Grand Am, but left me on the highway car park with a dead battery.  I still can not say stay away from the Pontiac cars, on one occasion. \n\nThe gun that Brother Mitho purchased can be a real lemon.  Possible.  \nBut this does not prove that all other Turkish guns are lemons also.  \nThere are certain quality requirements for producing guns and barrels.  A company can not produce out of these requirements.\n\n\nPakistan has been a very friendly country for Turkish people.  In a Turkish saying, it says, what hurts you most is the impact you had from a close friend, not from a foe.  \nIf I had the same comments that Mitho brother wrote from a hostile country, I wouldn''t mind at all, and I would hit back very hard.  \nBut from a Pakistani brother, these comments really hurt.  When I was a kid I remember saying the song "Jive Pakistan".\n\nBuying a product for a cheap price does not make it bad all the time.  When I first purchased my CZ 75 in 1995, it was the cheapest imported gun in MKEK.  No body can call it a bad gun.\nThey were new in the market and had to enter with lower prices.  \nThe same for the Turkish gun producers, that enter the Pakistan market.  \nThe marketing cost for any gun is cheap as dirt, unless it is custom made.  Beretta sold F-92 s to united states army for about 285 dollars a piece as far as I am concerned.  \nI dont believe that any Glock would cost more than 250 dollars to produce actually.  They would never publicly say that though.  Most of the money is spent on developing and patenting the products.\nThe prices come up as a result of wise marketing.   \nI am sure the turkish company will be after this product. \nI would like to see the pictures of the complained parts.

( Contender Pistols and XP 100 types)\nI unknowingly  hand loaded  and fired these in my magnum and although these would make 3/4 inch 5 shot groups at 100 yds I could not find a single bullet hole on a 4x4 feet target at 200 yds, comming back to 100 yds I shot again and again a 3/4 inch group and only then I noticed the bullet holes had  Comet Tails   these were already coming apart and some observers told me that there is a puff of smoke just beyond the 100 yd line each time I fired. I later had this phenomenon confirmed. Very light Varmint bullets should not be fired at the Very high magnum velocities.\nThe best long range bullets for the 7mm magnum are between the 150 and 175 grains.\nI am giving the trajectory of the 160 Grain Spitzer Boat Tail  Bullet with a BC of .560 fired at a MV of 2975  FPS \n\nRange.                 100yds                    200yds                  300yds              400yds               500yds\n300 yd zero\nTrajectory.          +3.5 inches            +4.2 ins                00                     (-) 9.8 ins            (-)25.9       (-)                                                             \n  200yd zero.       +1.4                       00                        (-)6.3 ins           (-)18.3 ins          (-)36.5 in\nMuzzle\nEnergy. 3197 Ft Lbs. 2838  Ft Lbs        2515 Ft Lbs          222.8 Ft Lbs          1953.6Ft Lbs     1713.6 Ftlbs\n\nData From Speer Reloading Manual Number 12.\n\nThe 7mm rem mag is a very versatile long range cartridge and from Urial to Himalayan Ibex to Marco Polo sheep , to Brown bear, and Neel gai one is never under gunned and never woried about the trajectory. How ever longer than 300 yds shots should only be taken with range confirmation through a Laser Range Finder and when the wind is not too strong.\nI print and tape the trajectory on the stock and cover it with transparent tape.It comes handy.\nPlease Zero your Rifle at a 100 yds from a sitting position with the rifle firmly rested on a sand bag or some thing, make sure the barrel is not touching any thing and squeeze off at least two five shot groups.

I have emboldened the text I found interesting.\n\nIn March 1898 the British started building a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya. The project was led by Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson. During the next nine months of construction, [B]two maneless male Tsavo lions stalked the campsite, dragging Indian workers from their tents at night and devouring them. Crews tried to scare off the lions and built campfires and bomas of thorn fences around their camp for protection to keep the maneaters out, to no avail[/B]. The lions crawled through the thorn fences. After the new attacks, hundreds of workers fled from Tsavo, halting construction on the bridge. Patterson set traps and tried several times to ambush the lions at night from a tree. [B]After repeated unsuccessful endeavors, he shot the first lion on December 9, 1898. Three weeks later, the second lion was found and killed. The first lion killed measured nine feet, eight inches (3 m) from nose to tip of tail. It took eight men to carry the carcass back to camp.[/B] The construction crew returned and completed the bridge in February 1899. The exact number of people killed by the lions is unclear. Patterson gave several figures, claiming that there were[B] 135 victims[/B].\n\n[B]Patterson writes in his account that he wounded the first lion with one bullet from a Martini-Enfield chambered in .303 caliber. This shot struck the lion in the hindquarters, but it escaped. Later, it returned at night and began stalking Patterson as he tried to hunt it. He shot it with a .303 Lee Enfield several times, tracked it the next morning, and found it dead. The second lion was shot five times with a .303 Lee Enfield, but it got up and charged him in severely crippled condition, whereupon he shot it three more times with the Martini-Henry carbine, twice in the chest, and once in the head, which killed it. He claimed it died gnawing on a fallen tree branch, still trying to reach him.[/B]\n\n[B]After 25 years as Patterson''s floor rugs, the lions'' skins were sold to the Chicago Field Museum in 1924 for a sum of US$5,000. The lions'' skins arrived at the museum in very poor condition. The lions were then reconstructed and are now on permanent display along with the original skulls.[/B]\n\nPatterson''s accounts were published in his 1907 book The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.\n\n[B]There was a third Tsavo Lion that was killed by Patterson. It was shot shortly after his arrival to the british railway. The lion was the first to be shot and forgotten about. With only 1 shot Patterson hit and killed the lion. Smaller in size compared to the other two the carcass was discarded.\n[/B]\n\n\n\n\np.s Is the .303 cal in-adequate for Big-Game like lions? The above text proves this.\n\n@Mig\nYou have said it earlier that Yes its completely based on a True Story. No, The character Charles Remington in the movie is completely fictional. More or less, it was Patterson who shot both the lions in reality.[/QUOTE]\nNice information [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/member.php?3199-Chauhdary"]Chauhdary[/URL][B] Sb :)\ni agree with u Charactor Charles Remington is Completely fictional [/B]', 1, 0, '111.88.42.134', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The British were impressed by the Gurkha soldiers and later raised Gurkha regiments in the East India Company army. Gurkhas served as troops under contract to the East India Company in the Pindaree War of 1817, in Bharatpur in 1826 and the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.\nDuring the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Gurkhas fought on the British side, and became part of the British Indian Army on its formation.\nDuring World War I (1914–18), more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties, and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards.\nbetween the World Wars, the Gurkha regiments fought in the Third Afghan War in 1919 and then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in Waziristan, where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier, keeping the peace amongst the local populace and keeping the lawless and often openly hostile Pathan tribesmen in check. \nA total of 250,280 Gurkhas served during World War II, earning 2,734 bravery awards and suffering around 32,000 casualties.\nAfter the British left India, Gorkhalis continued seeking employment in British and Indian forces.\nGurkhas have served in almost all war fought by India, including the wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971 and also against China in 1962. They have also been used in peacekeeping operations around the world. They have also served in Sri Lanka conducting operations against the Tamil Tigers.\nTwo Gurkhas regiments are held presently by Nepal too and a a platoon of Gurkhas is held by Singapore.', 0, 1, '115.186.116.85', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5886, 174671),

Some claim that it is the most popular civilian / sporting firearm in the history. \nDeveloped by Strum Ruger in the 1960''s the rifle is of a simple design by William B. Ruger, Harry H. Sefried .Production versions started appearing in the market in 1964. Over 5 million have been manufactured to date. \n\nMagazines: \nThe 10/22 utilized circular box type mags which would sit flush in the stock and hold 5 rounds each. Later on, standard box mags were also introduced.\n\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vjkq9fqc/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/O_B2A.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vjmdss84/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/O_DxJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nBarrel Lengths:\nRifle: 20"\nCarbine: 18.5"\nCompact Rifle: 16.125"\nTarget: 20" Bull Barrel\n\nStats:\nFirst Produced in 1964. Offered to date.\n22lr \nSemi Auto\nRimfire\n\nVariants:\nAs of date, 10/22 is offered in 5 configurations with variations in stock materials, barrel length, finish etc. I found the following variants noteworthy:\n\n10/22 Magnum\nA 22 Magnum version was also offered from 1998 to 2006 and later withdrawn. \n\n10/17\n.17hmr was added in 2004 and later withdrawn in 2006.\n\n10/22 International \nThis model was fitted with a Mannlicher stock and is now discontinued.\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vjxyk7ok/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/O_U_J.png[/img][/url]\n\n\n\nAWC Ultra 2\nIntegrally suppressed and resembles a bull barrel. The barrel is ported and is 16.5" \n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vk19mwo4/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/O_Z_0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\nOverall, the 10/22 is a heavily customized / experimented upon gun which saw many variations through its life. Yet it continues to be a popular firearm amongst the shooting community. Pictures from various sources on the internet are listed below to give you some idea of the shapes and sizes this rifle has adapted over the years. \n\n\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vkjgjq3o/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P0qqA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vkycdujo/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P0MSS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vkzzx71g/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P0Pn0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vl1ngjj8/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P0RS9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vl3azw10/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P0Umi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vl9x5a04/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P13kS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vlevrbhg/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P1aPi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vlgjanz8/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P1djr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vli6u0h0/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P1fOA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vllhwpgk/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P1kNS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vloszeg4/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P1pN9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vlqgiqxw/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P1shi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/2vls423fo/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/P1uMr.gif[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '202.163.71.194', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6285, 174713),

They wanted a design offering a high-level of comfort and ergonomics, based on the CZ 75 operating system. Called a "Generation 3" pistol, the P-01 is the final result of that journey down the road of new ideas. It fulfills the need for a lightweight, compact pistol having the same durability and accuracy of a full-sized, full-weight pistol. The National Police had a tough list of requirements--so tough, many companies simply bowed-out of the bid process, but CZ staked a claim to the prize--and won it.\n\nTough Tests for cz75 \n\nThe P-01 was accepted after almost three years of testing and development. What CZ did to win the bid is something that few (how about zero?) designs have ever had to go through before greeting the buying public. For a military gun, sure, but in this case, the general public gets the same gun, same design and same specs as the police and military.\n\nFor instance, according to the information supplied by CZ, the gun had to withstand 4,000 dry-firings, 3,000 de-cockings, operator-level disassembly and re-assembly 1,350 times, complete disassembly (all the way down to pins and springs) 150 times, 100-percent parts interchangeability, a 1.5 meter drop test (54 times) on concrete, three meter drop test, firing after being frozen at -36 F for 24 hours, firing after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations--and after having been stripped of all oil. The service life must exceed 15,000 rounds of P 9mm ammo and indeed, testing revealed the P-01 has exceeded 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.\n\nThe reliability requirement protocol was particularly astounding. Set at 98.8 percent (.2 percent) failure rate, this was tough-enough for any gun. This equals 20 stoppages per 10,000 rounds, or 500 "mean rounds between failures" (MRBF). During testing, the average number of stoppages was only seven per 15,000 rounds, or .05 percent failure rate. This translates to a MRBF rate of 2,142 rounds. That happens to be about five times the minimum acceptable rate for the U.S. Army, which is set at 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 gr. ball ammo. The bottom line here is the fact this appears to be a rugged, highly reliable design, despite its small size and alloy frame. With this kind of testing history--and our own shooting experiences with the P-01--we think it should be a breeze for it to hold-up to anything a civilian shooter could dish at it.', 0, 1, '94.169.12.81', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6290, 174862),

His success in slaying the man-eaters earned him much respect and fame amongst the people residing in the villages of Kumaon, many of whom considered him a sadhu (saint).\n\nCorbett was an avid photographer and after his retirement, authored the Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Jungle Lore and other books recounting his hunts and experiences, which enjoyed much critical acclaim and commercial success. Corbett spoke out for the need to protect India''s wildlife from extermination. The Jim Corbett National Park in Kumaon was named in his honour in 1957.\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/g13wbpac/][img]http://s1.postimage.org/7UnLS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nIf you knew about more hunters kindly list them here.', 0, 1, '119.156.24.105', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6299, 175109),

He hunted consistently until his last years, in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.\n\nHe forged his skills chasing asian elephants and sambar in Ceylon,[3] a place where Rowland Ward''s records account him for some of world largest wild boar trophies. He traveled looking for sport in Asia Minor in 1860, in Scotland in 1869 for red stag, in the Rocky Mountains in 1881 downing elk, grizzly and buffalo. In 1886 he was in the French Alps, looking for brown bear and many times in India in 1885 and 1887-1889 pursuing tigers and blackbuck. His most memorable cynegetic exploits remained the episodes in Africa and Ceylon, where he returned again towards the end of his life in 1887. He also visited for sport, Transylvania for bears, Serbia for wild boars, Hungary for deer, Cyprus in 1879, China and Japan.\n\nHe left a wealth of study in the science of hunting firearms and ballistics, and accounts as one of the world''s few hunters that used the two bore rifle, the world''s largest gun caliber for the purpose. He described in great detail his observations of the animal world, account in which, his book Wild Beasts And Their Ways (1890) ranks highest.\n\nIn 1863, the German zoologist Theodor von Heuglin, named a subspecie of Roan antelope in his honor: Hippotragus e. bakeri or Baker’s antelope. In Sri Lanka the Baker''s Falls bears his name, and in 1906 Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi while in Ruwenzori, Uganda named Mount Baker in his honour.\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/34laak0ys/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/TsiRr.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '111.119.186.187', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6299, 175137),

He was educated at Eton, England, and at eighteen joined the East India Company''s service as a cornet in the Madras Light Cavalry. The climate of India not suiting him, after two years experience he retired from the service and returned to Scotland.\n\nDuring his stay in the East he had laid the foundation of his collection of hunting trophies and specimens of natural history. In 1843 he joined the Cape Mounted Rifles, but for the sake of absolute freedom sold out at the end of the year and with an ox wagon and a few native followers set out for the interior. He hunted chiefly in Bechuanaland and the valley of the Limpopo River, regions then swarming with big game.

Last month i posted few details about this pistol which are as under. \n\nGood things about Taurus PT 709 Slim:\n    *  The gun is very slim, sleek, stylish, and light weight.\n    *  It has three dot sight and the rear sight is adjustable with the keys provided.\n    *  The slide and barrel is made from high quality steel.\n    *  Glock like Trigger Safety, Slide safety latch, and Taurus Key lock safey.\n    *  Comes with two magazines, nylon cleaning brush, keys, plastic box, and a instructions manual which covers all aread of operations.\n    *  D/A and S/A trigger.\n    *  Concealable and might fit in a ankle holster.\n    *  Recoil is medium and can effectively hit a subject at the range of 15 meters.\n    *  Good back up self defence gun.\n    *  Disassembly and Assembly is easy.\n    *  Chromed lined barrel\n    *  Loaded chamber indicator\n\nThings i didn''t liked about the gun:\n    \n    * The gun grip is too small for a person with big hands, medium hand individuals can compromise on it''s grip size if they are facinated by it''s looks. It didn''t fit my hands well although i tried compromising, but couldn''t compromise on the following.\n    * The frame of the gun was not of very good quality.\n    * Most of the internal mechanism of the frame is plastic.\n    * Disassembly nob is very cheap and might break after few field strippings.\n    * Guide rod in my gun was discolored; looked old.\n    * Guide rod was not a perfect fit and looked like plastic.\n    * Guide rod is resting on the very thin line of the barrel and might go give rest to the guide rod for a longer period of time.\n    * Magazines are limited to seven rounds and no extended magazines available around the globe as per the dealer.\n    * Slide was encountering the stoppage during the bullet extraction process.\n    * Trigger is soft, but fire takes place when the trigger is pulled fully back.\n    * Slow hitting firing pin\n\nI would add here is that i returned Taurus PT709 Slim after three days of its purchase in September 2010 with a instant loss of 3K.', 0, 1, '115.186.44.133', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6314, 175480),

I purchased it for 48K from National Traders Lahore. Last month i posted few details about this pistol which are as under. \n\nGood things about Taurus PT 709 Slim:\n    *  The gun is very slim, sleek, stylish, and light weight.\n    *  It has three dot sight and the rear sight is adjustable with the keys provided.\n    *  The slide and barrel is made from high quality steel.\n    *  Glock like Trigger Safety, Slide safety latch, and Taurus Key lock safey.\n    *  Comes with two magazines, nylon cleaning brush, keys, plastic box, and a instructions manual which covers all aread of operations.\n    *  D/A and S/A trigger.\n    *  Concealable and might fit in a ankle holster.\n    *  Recoil is medium and can effectively hit a subject at the range of 15 meters.\n    *  Good back up self defence gun.\n    *  Disassembly and Assembly is easy.\n    *  Chromed lined barrel\n    *  Loaded chamber indicator\n\nThings i didn''t liked about the gun:\n    \n    * The gun grip is too small for a person with big hands, medium hand individuals can compromise on it''s grip size if they are facinated by it''s looks. It didn''t fit my hands well although i tried compromising, but couldn''t compromise on the following.\n    * The frame of the gun was not of very good quality.\n    * Most of the internal mechanism of the frame is plastic.\n    * Disassembly nob is very cheap and might break after few field strippings.\n    * Guide rod in my gun was discolored; looked old.\n    * Guide rod was not a perfect fit and looked like plastic.\n    * Guide rod is resting on the very thin line of the barrel and might go give rest to the guide rod for a longer period of time.\n    * Magazines are limited to seven rounds and no extended magazines available around the globe as per the dealer.\n    * Slide was encountering the stoppage during the bullet extraction process.\n    * Trigger is soft, but fire takes place when the trigger is pulled fully back.\n    * Slow hitting firing pin\n\nI would add here is that i returned Taurus PT709 Slim after three days of its purchase in September 2010 with a instant loss of 3K.[/quote]\n\nDear Sir, Thanks for guidance.\n\nMajor disadventage I think is "   * Slide was encountering the stoppage during the bullet extraction process" this is real problem as you experienced, for other concerns I think plastic seems to break/wear & tear etc but my G2 surefire tourch is of a plastic that is more tougher than steel, other examples are of Glock etc, whatever now I am inclined towards RAMI as can not depend my life on whatever you explained in such detail.

Some pro''s, some cons, and of-course, some bias. Cutting it short, this handgun''s been on my wish list since last year. Finally I heard the CZs are in town. Better grab one I thought. When I asked about it, the dealer said he didn’t have any Shadow but a CZ 75 phantom. Finally, when I inquired about the "steel" frame phantom, I was shown the Shadow :) The first thing that you notice holding it is the balance. The gun is slightly muzzle heavy. The second thing you notice is the weight (1.2 kg Approx.)\n\n[b]In the Box:\n[/b]\n[list=*]\n[*]The plastic box had a the usual paper work,\nA bore brush\nA flimsy plastic pull through lever\nTwo 18 round mags\nThe pistol itself\nA spare main spring\nA target print out marked with the serial number of the gun.[/*]\n[/list]\n\n[b]After Purchase ( In chronological order)[/b]:\nScrubbing.

Got my range membership recently as well. In fact, it was my third time at the range when I shot the shadow for the first time. [b]So, I do believe the pistol can do much better in the hands of a good shooter.[/b]\n\n[b]Day 1 with the shadow:[/b]\nThe pistol shot beautifully. The impatient man pulling the trigger, not very much. The results were good none the less. Specially the pseudo rapid (one shot / second. ) target results shown below. This was shot with Chinese Polytech Ammo (White Box). Targets are 25m Precision Pistol targets.\n\n[b]Things that stood out on day 1[/b]: The trigger creep. Pre travel had creep. The break had creep. Fortunately there wasn’t any post travel and the trigger reset was very good. \n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/u6rd5lqc/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/eSCUi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/u6t0oy84/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/eSFor.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/u6uo8apw/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/eSHTA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Day 2 with the shadow:[/b]\nDay two was better. I had more patience and shot much better groups. Targets follow. All shots were taken at 15 meters. Targets are standard NRA 25 m Precision Pistol targets. The First target is wrongly marked as a previous day target. Kindly excuse the error.\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/u6xzazpg/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/eSMSS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/u6zmuc78/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/eSPn0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Total Stats:[/b]\n[b]Number of rounds:[/b] 350\n[b]Types of Ammunition fired[/b]: Armscor FMJ, Chinese Polytech FMJ, Wolf FMJ, FNH FMJ (Belgium) , POF FMJ, Tula FMJ.\n[b]Stoppages: [/b]None what so ever. \n\n[b]Looking Back / After thoughts.[/b]\n[b]Value for Money[/b]: Unbeatable.\nYou pay almost equivalent to the US price (880 USD after discount) unlike other 500 ~ 600 USD pistols which are retailing here for 300 K onwards.\nOverall a wonderful purchase.

Pre travel has no creep now and the break is crispier. I m counting on the trigger to really shine once I cross the 1000 round mark. \nThe shadow will take you for a ride if you want to do IPSC style shooting (speed) but it is a difficult pistol to shoot for precision shooting. Not very forgiving when it comes to trigger errors. You do something slightly wrong, and rest assured, it will be reflected on your score. Its just that way with precision machines I guess :) The CZ TS on the other hand, is very forgiving. But lets save the TS for later.\n\n[b]Recoil:[/b] This gun handles very nice in my hands. I can assure you of the fact that you will not wait to pull that trigger again, and again. Very little muzzle climb. The sights just hug the target as if tied down by an invisible bungee cord. It’s a pleasure to shoot.  \n \n[b]Someday / Maybe Projects: [/b]\nI m thinking Mamba!', 0, 1, '202.163.71.194', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6323, 175744),

Please feel free to comment.\n\n\nT[b][u]axidermy:	Requirements, Introduction and Field Care[/u][/b]\n\nInstinctively, hobbyists like to display their hobbies in form of trophies, posters, calendars, computer screen savers etc. hunters and zoo owners do the same in form of mounts.\n\nDecorating trophy rooms with trophies of beautiful or rare species or with animals and bird that are related with some memorable moments has always been a great desire of hunters.\n\nWhenever hunting partners gather, these trophies become proof of their glorious hunts. These trophies make those memories long lasting.\n\nZoo operators spend a lot of time with the birds/animals they take care for. This indulges them in love with the denizens of their workplace. And whenever one of their beloved bird or animal dies, they are left with no other option but to go to a taxidermist.\n\nExtinct or rare species of birds and animals in mounted forms are also used in educational institutes for study purpose. All over the world, museums of natural history possess large number of mounted trophies. Smithsonian Institute is one of the best examples where several thousand species have been stored in mounted form. Most of them are several hundred years old. Even some of them have completely been extinct.\n\nNo taxidermist can set high standards of his work until or unless he is provided with good skins. A taxidermist or stuffer can only mount the skin provided to him. Good trophies cannot be prepared from bad specimen. Therefore birds or animals should be very carefully observed before deciding whether or not to have it mounted.\n\nMost of the people don’t care for the dead specimen in the field. For beautiful trophies one must consider the general condition of the animal keeping following points in mind:\n\n•	Selection of specimen for mounting purpose,\n•	Zibah,\n•	Field care,\n•	Storage & Transportation\n\n[b][u]SELECTION OF SPECIMEN FOR MOUNTING PURPOSE:[/u][/b]\n\nA good mount begins right in the field. Good mounts can only be prepared if proper filed care is done. Even the best taxidermist can’t make a good mount, if proper field care is not done. Without proper field care an outstanding specimen can be ruined so easily.\n\n[b]BIRDS[/b]\n\n1.	Size of the bird, sharpness of colors and general condition of plumage represent the condition and health of the bird. Birds with good health, sharp colors and good plumage should be selected for mounting purpose.\n2.	Birds should not have pinfeathers. Pinfeathers are newly grown feather. These feathers contain blood in their roots. Usually in the mounting process these feathers shed away. Birds with pinfeathers should not be selected for mounting.\n3.	Try to avoid selecting a bird that has damaged or broken bones.\n4.	Always try to select full grown birds.\n5.	If possible, do not Zibah the bird that you have decided to get mounted.\n\n[b]ANIMALS[/b]\n\n1.	Road kills are usually not good specimen for mounting.\n2.	Rotting smell or green skin represents the body decay process. Animals with these indicators are not good specimen for mounting.\n3.	Animal whose heads have been detached from the rest of the skin are not good specimen for taxidermy.\n4.	Animals having large bullet holes on their heads are should not be selected for mounting purpose.\n\n[u]Field Care[/u]\n\n[b]BIRDS[/b]\n\n1.	In the field, never place the bird in a plastic bag. Since plastic bags don’t allow good ventilation, which raises the temperature and speeds up the body decay process (after death decomposition of body due to bacterial growth).\n2.	Always lift the bird from its legs.\n3.	Never place anything over the bird even during traveling back from the field.\n4.	Never wipe the bird for blood or any other dirt.\n5.	Never, under any circumstances, cut the belly open.\n\n[b]ANIMALS[/b]\n\nField care is almost same for animals as for birds except for a few steps.\n\n1.	Never drag the animal.\n2.	Try not to skin the animal, if possible.\n3.	Wipe off blood or body fluids if there are some, with some soft cloth. If a dead animal remains in blood or body fluids for long period, the skin might start to loose hair. Wiping step should be done with animals only not with birds.\n4.	Store in deep freezer as soon as possible.\n5.	Never, under any circumstances, skin the head area. Leave this job to the taxidermist. Only a professional taxidermist has the knowledge and skills to do this job.\n6.	In the field, never place the animal in a plastic bag. Since plastic bags don’t allow good ventilation, which raises the temperature and speeds up, the body decay process (after death decomposition of body due to bacterial growth).\n7.	Never place anything over the animal even during traveling back from the field.\n\n[u]ZIBAH[/u]\n\nBeing a Muslim, it is imperative for us to zibah every animal or bird if we want to eat its meat. Following procedure must be followed in order to zibah an animal if it is to be mounted.\n\n1.	Always use sharp knife. Blunt knife causes scratches, these scratches are hard to sew and hide as well.\n2.	Hold the skin from back side of the neck tightly between your thumb and the index finger of left hand and zibah with your right hand. This method pulls the skin straight and tight against the neck and cut for zibah is very straight, short and nice.\n3.	Before placing the knife on the neck lift hair/feathers with the knife blade and then place the knife underneath. In this way least number of feathers/hair is cut. As a result stitching is easy to hide.\n4.	Drive the knife straight. Knife must not be driven all across the neck.\n\n[b][u]STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION[/u][/b]\n\n1.	During traveling, back from the field or from home to the taxidermist, never place anything over the bird/animal.\n2.	Place the bird/animal in plastic bag and release as much air as possible, seal the bag and place the bag in the deep freezer.\n3.	Place the bird in the freezer in the way that does not fold its feathers.\n4.	Never wrap the specimen in newspaper. Newspaper absorbs body moisture and causes freezer burn.\n\n[b][u]INTRODUCTION OF STUFFING AND TAXIDERMY[/u][/b]\n\nThere are two basic techniques that are used to preserve animal/birds, stuffing and taxidermy. A short introduction of stuffing and taxidermy along with advantages and disadvantages is as follows:\n\n[u]Stuffing[/u]\n\nAs obvious from the word stuffing, the skin is stuffed with cotton or polyester.\n\n[b]Birds[/b]\n\n	Birds are skinned, shoulder bone (humeral bone) from wings and thigh up to knee (Femur, tibia and Fibula) from legs are removed. A structure of wire is constructed inside the skin. Dry preservative is applied and the bird skin is stuffed with cotton.\n\n[b]ANIMAL/GAME HEADS[/b]\n\nHead is not completely skinned. The skin is inverted like a sock as far as possible. Flesh from cheeks and throat is removed from the inner side. Lips are stitched. Dry preservative is applied inside the skin. A rod is inserted into the skull and cotton is filled between the rod and skin.\n\n[u]ADVANTAGES OF STUFFING[/u]\n\n1.	Stuffing is a very cost effective technique. Mounting cost is very cheap.\n2.	It takes less time to mount any bird or animal as compared to the taxidermy.\n\n[u]DISADVANTAGES OF STUFFING[/u]\n\n[b]Birds[/b]\n1.	Bird skins are neither wire wheeled nor washed. Thus fat deposits cannot be removed. These fat deposits are the primary reason for lessening mount’s life.\n2.	Trophies prepared from unwire wheeled skins look like shrunken trophies.\n3.	Chemicals used in stuffing are usually highly toxic/carcinogenic.\n4.	Mounts distort in short period.\n\n[b]Animals[/b]\n\n1.	Mammal’s proper anatomical details and musculature cannot be achieved\n2.	Skins cannot be shaved. Shaving is the process that thins down the thickness of the raw hide prior to tanning. Without shaving skin cannot be tanned properly.\n3.	Since the skin is not thinned, as soon as it dries it shrinks remarkably and the mount stats to look like a shrunken trophy.\n4.	Mounts can be prepared in limited poses.\n5.	Dry preservative cannot penetrate like liquid tanning chemicals, therefore it does not preserve skins for a very long period.\n\nAs far as gameheads are concerned, the best way to assess whether the trophy was stuffed or mounted is to look at its lip line.  If the lips are stitched, it is definitely stuffed not mounted.  A skin cannot be tanned without splitting its eyes, ears nose and lips.\n\n[b][u]Taxidermy[/u][/b]\n\nThe word taxidermy is derived from two Greek words, taxi & derma. Taxi means movement and derma means skin. Thus the technique used to recreate dead birds or animals in life like form with the ability to align the skin on its form in its proper position is called taxidermy.\n\nProper measurements of the skin are taken and manikins or forms are sculpted according to the anatomical details of the species.\n\n[b]Birds:[/b]\n\nBirds are skinned, skins are wire wheeled (wire wheeling removes membranes and fat deposits), washed with specially designed detergents and solvents. This process of washing allows complete penetration of preservatives.\n\n[b]Game heads:[/b]\n\nIn taxidermy, game heads are completely skinned, eyes, ears, nose and lips are turned and the skins are tanned (tanning is the process which transforms skins into leather) and mounted on sculpted manikins. Since these manikins are sculpted after taking proper measurements of the animal and keeping in view the anatomical details of the animal therefore these mounts look better than the pillow like round shaped trophies that are prepared through stuffing.\n\n[u]Advantages[/u]\n\n1.	For taxidermy mounts, the skin must be tanned (a process which transforms raw skin into leather. Just like leather, tanned skin has a very long life.\n2.	Tanning chemicals have no after effect.\n3.	The mount holds its condition for a very long period.\n4.	Proper anatomical details and musculature can be obtained.\n\n[u]Disadvantages[/u]\n\n1.	Taxidermy required more to prepare a trophy as compared to stiffing.\n2.	Taxidermy is an expensive technique.\n\nIf you want to assess whether the trophy was stuffed or mounted, look at its lip line. If the lips are not stitched but tucked in, it is definitely mounted not stuffed. Tucked in lips indicate that the skin was properly fleshed and tanned.\n\nNature has created every living thing in curves circles. Have you ever seen squares or sharp corners in any animal or bird? Never. Its only taxidermy that gives us the ability to recreate these curves.', 0, 1, '175.107.1.240', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6326, 175798),

What is the caliber? Can I shoot it/ should I shoot it? A guess on the value in Pakistan would be highly appreciated..  I want to take it to a competent gunsmith to have it checked over before shooting it. Can you guys please suggest me any person in Lahore who can help me with all this? Any buyer if I want to sell it?\n\nMany Thanks,\nRegards', 0, 1, '58.27.146.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6332, 175887),

Straight pistol grips were prefered in two trigger shot guns where free movement of hand/ fingers are involved to pull front  or rear trigger to shot the barrel as per the requirement.\nFew people prefer OO for the reason that their eyes are located in OO manner, few prefer 8 for the reason that while aiming they tilt their head towards one side thus making one eye over the other in figure 8 fashion, but these are the miths as [b]DRILLINGS[/b] would require [b]Three eyes [/b]to fire accurately.\nHowever  both guns have few merits which attracts its user as under :-\nIn 8, the jerk of gun travels upward, thus giving less uncomfort to the cheek, where as in OO the jerk travels side ways and if you are right hand shooter placing your right cheek to the wooden stock after firing couple of boxes will feel soar/uneasyness in your right cheek. Likewise in 8, the hand on the forearm easily curl around the  fore end ensuring proper grip where as in OO one has to ensure that while holding the fore end the fingers must not come over the barrel / ribs.In 8, two trigger choice is not their ( or very limited)  where as OO has the provision of two triggers liked by classic gun users.For skeet/ competition people prefer 8 or Semi Autos as in shot gun you don''t have to Aim, the Pointing serve the result, but still the target/object remains in site due to 8 or SA sleek barrel, where as some times the OO muzzle covers the object.

One should concentrate on double taps in order to achieve reassuring results on a target, which takes more practice in a shorter barrel. \n[url=http://postimage.org/image/zlth16is/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hxJPS.jpg[/img][/url]\nfront side of the target 15 meter bench rest\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/zlv4kj0k/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hxMk0.jpg[/img][/url]\nreverse side of the target for ease of identification of shots, one can easily see the loss of concentration at the lower side of the target  :) \n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/zmll62x0/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hypei.jpg[/img][/url]\nMy Canik 55 compact with target sights and orthopedic grips.

I joined it because I''m pretty sure this is the best place to get some help/advice.\n\nSo here''s the background to my query.\n\nMy grandfather had a .32 385 amongst other guns. When he passed away in 2003, the gun was registered to my father''s name. Now my family was overseas pretty much the entire time, London and now Dubai. So because my father had to go back to Dubai, he deposited that particular gun at a private dealer storage and got a receipt and other related documents to do with the storage.\n\nSo everything was fine. Every year, my cousin would go down to the GPO and renew all our licences. The licence is up to date and all the paperwork is with us. Now this particular gun was the only one in storage, the rest are with my uncle. I mean it wasn''t a big deal, so whatever.\n\nNow fast-forward to 2010, I''m visiting Pakistan and went to the dealer to reclaim the gun to hand over to my uncle. I went to the dealer and I spoke with the dealer about collecting the 385 so he goes that he''s only bought the dealership a few years ago and he''ll have to check for the gun. Now I gave him a few days and called back.\n\nToday, he told me he can''t locate the gun as there''s a 3 year limit to gun storage and the previous owner probably deposited the gun with the government or their arsenal factory or the police might have raided the premises and so he has failed to locate it. Now to me, it all smells fishy. Wouldn''t he as a new owner also acquire all liabilities and all assets and be responsible for receipts to do with the name and address of the dealer?\n\nNow I''m here for advice because I''m unfamiliar with the rules and regulations in Pakistan. But I really would like to collect the gun as it has sentimental value for us and apparently its a really fine and expensive piece of machinery. Right so if any of you can give me some advice and information regarding the rules and regulations and what steps I should take, please do!\n\nI''ll give you a summary:\n\n- Gun deposited at private arms dealer for storage.\n- 7 years later, trying to reclaim it.\n- Storage owner says there is a 3 year limit to storage and he''s not aware of the gun and he will check.\n- I wait a week and contact him, he says he cannot locate the gun.\n- What should I do?', 0, 1, '110.36.56.154', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6351, 176369),

Previously it was also judging distance but the advent of pocket size range finders have over come this problem.\nThe wind how ever is a major problem.\nThere are several types of wind.\nStrong wind from where you are shooting  but none or  mild at the target end. ( you can see from the way the trees or bushes or Range flags act.\nMild wind at the shooters position but strong at target end.\nMild at the shooters position and mild at the target end but very strong in between, like when one is shooting across a river or cross canyon which is very common in the Northern Mountains.\nNow the wind effects the bullet most when it is close to the shooter, or if the bullet encounters strong wind in the beginning it will be effected most as from the start it will go in a divergent angle.\nIn the infantry we have three types of wind, Mild, Medium and  Strong. I will dis cuss it in these three headings.\nIn the MILD  WIND  the wind velocity is like 8 to 16 KM per Hr you feel the wind on your face and the leaves on the trees move without bending the tree tops, the bushes  do not sway but the leaves move.\n\nIn the MEDIUM WIND the wind will be felt be your whole body and you will see the tree tops slightly sway with the wind the wind speed will be some thing like a 16 to 30 Km per hour.\n\nSTRONG WIND\nThe wind will be felt by your body and the the tree tops will sway strongly the bushes will be bent and you will see pufffs of dust rising.The speed could be between 35 to50 Km or more.\n  \nThe Cross winds ( 3 to 9 O'' clock or 9 to 3 O'' clock ) have most effect on a bullets flight. The diagonal  wind  has half the effect and in between the angles are hard to judge.\nThere is yet another problem that of the Fish tail wind, which  moves like a fish tail, swaying from one direction to another. Then another variation is the gusty wind which comes in gusts and stops and again a gust after it slowly dies down to rise again.\nYou must hae experienced these types of winds and some of you would have noted these variations.\nNow the bullets with a Higher  BALLISTIC COEFFICIENT are effected less relatively and the ones with lower are effected more. If you do not know the BC of your bullets a round nose bullet with a flat base and light for the caliber bullet will have a low BC. A pointed or Spitzer Bullet with a Boat Tail and which  falls in the middle or towards the heavier side for the calber will have a high BC and will be effected less.\nI will give the wind deflection Tables for some of the Popular Bullets.\n\n270 Winchester \n  \n10 MPH X wind  Blt Wt & Shape   Muzzle Velocity  Deflection@ 100--- 200---300--400--500 yds\n  \n                    130 Gr Ptd BT        3000 Fps                           .7 ins---2.9 in---6.6in--12.3--20in   \n                     140 Gr Ptd BT       2900 FPS                           .7in-----2.8in---6.5----12.1--19.6\n                      150 Gr Ptd Bt       2800FPS                            .7in----2.8-----6.7----12.5--20ins\n\n.243 Win        95 gr Ptd Bt           2900FPS                            .9ins---3.5----8.4----15.7---25.8\n                  \n.308 Win         165 Ptd BT          2750FPS                              .7ins----2.9--- -7---12.9----20.7   \n\n30-06             165 Ptd BT          2900FPS                              .7ins--  2.7in--6.2----11.6--18.9\n\n7mm REm Mag 160 Ptd BT        3000FPS                              .4ins--2.ins---4.5--8ins---15ins  \n\nReference Nosler Reloading Manual  Number  3\n\nWhen shooting in oblique wind the values of deflection will be half.

(155593, 4484, 0, 'Abbas', 1, '', 1288353069, 'Salams, \n\nA lot of members and friends have asked me time and again on how to clean their handguns. Most new gun owners seldom find the right guidance which results in a much shorter firearms lifespan. I had a couple of guns to clean today so took some pictures to give a basic "How to".\n\n[B]Step 1: Preparation and a few words[/B]\n\nBefore anything check and double check your firearm to confirm it''s empty. Keep your hand off the trigger, take the magazine out, rack the slide a few times, then engage the slide lock in open position and visually inspect the chamber to confirm. The cleaning tools I use are Hoppes Powder Solvent (Approx Rs. 500), Hoppes Lubricating Oil (Rs. 500), Cleaning patching (buy them or cut up on old lint free cotton cloth), Cleaning brush (Rs. 15). Although I don''t use WD40 at all , I have included it in the picture as it can be used in place of both Hoppes products. I don''t like it though and would never use it on my handguns. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThere are 3 main parts of a pistol one must clean, the Barrel, the Slide and the frame.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Step: 2 Cleaning[/B]\n\nTake a small cotton patch (I use Muzzle Loader Shooting Patches from Southern Bloomer U.K) put it over the bottle and turn it upside down on the patch for half a second. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT5.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow clean the barrel using the same patch. Before is before:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is after a using the same patch: Clean using it and another patch if you feel necessary.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT7.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNext run the brush through the barrel a couple of time to loosen any residue stuck in the groves. Then either use the cleaning rod with a patch or put the patch over the cleaning brush and run it though the barrel a couple of times. When the patch gets dirty or misshaped use another one. Dip the second patch with powder solvent and the run it though the barrel again a couple of times. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT8.jpg[/IMG]\n\nVisually inspect the barrel pointing toward the light to see if it''s clean, the slide and frame are to be cleaned the same way. I use the brush on the hammer portion of the frame as well to loosen any grime. Also I use a small flat screwdriver with the cotton patch to clean the grime stuck between the extractor and firing pin plate. \n\nAll clean:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[B]Step: 3 Lubrication[/B]\n\nA lot friends are confused about this one. I have seen educated gun enthusiasts whose pistols are dripping oil. Excess oil does not make your gun run better! All you [U]need [/U]for the entire gun is ONE DROP of oil applied in the right places. I use a cotton ear bud and put a drop of oil on in like shown below:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT10.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThen I apply it to slide and frame like so: \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT11-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT12.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI would also like to mention that some like to use grease instead of oil. That is fine as well, in my experience steel frames like grease more and polymer runs better with oil. Some say using grease helps retain accuracy after 5 to 7 thousand rounds. Use what you prefer. I like to ''[I]grease the rails and oil the springs[/I]''\n\nAnd that''s all there is to it !  \n\nHere is the gun reassembled and patches and cotton bud used:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT13.jpg[/IMG]\n\n*Misc notes:\n\n1).There is no perfect way to clean/lube guns. Everyone has a slightly different preference. In the write up above I have shown you mine.\n\n2). Some people like to apply a touch of oil to the barrel. I don''t, when fired the oil heats up the barrel much more and over time it will kill your barrel faster. Before storing guns is another matter and again should be cleaned before use. \n\n3). Never dip your handgun slide in Diesel / Mitti ka tail etc. Apart from damaging the finish and smelling nasty, it will get inside the firing pin area, loosen all the grime which in most cases gets stuck on the firing pin causing failures to fire. \n\n4). I disassemble and clean my pistol magazines after about 1000 rounds. \n\n5). I also like to take off the grips every 1000 rounds and clean the grip area from inside. \n\n6). Never fire your gun with the slide off. \n\n7). Loaded or not, always practice gun safety.', 0, 1, '115.186.34.32', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6361, 176659),

About 3 AM, one very cold morning, a state police officer responded to a call. There was a car off the shoulder of the road outside Casper, WY. He located the car, stuck in deep snow, and with the engine still running.\n \nPulling in behind the car with his emergency lights on, the officer walked to the driver''s door to find an older man passed out behind the wheel with a nearly empty vodka bottle on the seat beside him. The driver came awake when the officer tapped on the window. Seeing the rotating lights in his rear view mirror, and the state policeman standing next to his car, the man panicked. He jerked the gearshift into ''drive'' and hit the gas.\n \nThe car''s speedometer was showing 20-30-40 and then 50 mph, but it was still stuck in the snow, wheels spinning. The policeman, having a sense of humor, began running in place next to the speeding, but still stationary car. The driver was totally freaked, thinking the officer was actually keeping up with him. This goes on for about 30 seconds, then the officer yelled at the man to ''Pull over!'' The man obeyed, turned his wheel and stopped the engine. Needless to say, the man from Casper was arrested, and is probably still shaking his head over the state patrolman who could run 50 miles per hour.

The point about adrenaline, tunnel vision, loss of fine motor skills and the fight or flight response in a lethal confrontation in general is well understood on this forum. But THAT is where training comes into play. That scalpel in the hands of a rookie surgeon (a SURGEON nonetheless) may quiver, yet be sure as a rock in the hands of a veteran. Whats the difference?? Experts say, and I mean those who train law enforcement and army, that if you put in the hard training time and excel, then even if you''re half as good on your worst day in a critical incident you''re 100% better than a Rs 3000 tees bore toting criminal. We are creatures of habit, in times of stress we fall back on what we know. Training makes all the difference.\n\nIts easy to discount the need of accuracy in selfishly defending oneself letting other innocents die. Just think if you, or worse, one of your loved ones is the unfortunate innocent by-stander, does that go equally well with you? Guns being a hobby and sport is understood and acknowledged.

Ammo shakal se he mashkook tha.[/b][/quote]\nNo doubt cougar is a good handgun but it is surprising that you have laid all responsibility on the ammo? \n\nOK, let me explain. There could be 3 culprits with regard to this problem of "shoot kidhar karta hu aur jata kidhar." Gun, ammo or the Shooter himself. Working on probabilities, the maximum burden of this problem of "shoot kidhar karta hu aur jata kidhar" can lie with the shooter''s technique, then with the gun and in the last with the ammo. \n\nIf the first two are good, than how much of a difference the ammo would make? Very less actually. In tangible terms, say if you are making 2 inch group with a good quality ammo, you will make a 4.5 inch group with an inconsistent ordinary kind of ammo and plus, there may be a few misfires / other ammo related stoppages. That is the difference between a good and a bad ammo. It is quite improbable that with good ammo you are hitting all bullets in the bull and with a bad ammo you are hitting most of them outside the target. \n\nI would suggest that you have a look at your technique. Shoot with one hand consistently (your powerful hand) and make sure you are not flinching, jerking or anticipating recoil. Control your breath and focus on the front site tip. Let the target be a blur in the background. Press the trigger with a uniform force, slowly and achieve surprise break. I am sure you would shoot better. \n\nIf there is no problem with your shooting technique than the problem is with the gun (in probabilities). If a gun does "shoot kidhar karta hu aur jata kidhar" than how come its a good gun?? \n\nThe share of ammo in this kind of shooting is the least. Unless you have some specific observations about the ammo to share with us. :)\n\nregards', 0, 1, '110.37.24.225', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1774, 177094),

Firearms cleaners/lubes/solvents often cause dieseling in your airguns, and can result in a dead airgun\n\nWD 40 IS A NO NO because it is disastrous on seals and other synthetic parts. This oil has very strong solvent properties that actually break or decompose some rubber  seals and o-rings  and  will cause dieseling because its petroleum based\n\nMainspring:\nthis has to provide the power and must be able to move with as little friction and vibration as possible,if it is noisy when being cocked it requires some lube.about 5 or 6 drops of oil should be sufficient,or if the gun is stripped down it should be coated in spring tar or moly grease and refitted,its best to put less oil in than too much because its easy to ruin a gun with over lubrication.\n\n\nCompression Chamber:\nthis is the part where the air is compressed by the piston,the air is heated to 2000 degrees farenheit for a fraction of a second by the compression  and for this reason only high flash point lubricants must be used.WARNING!! If any normal petroleum based lubricant is used this will cause an explosion called dieseling which can very quickly destroy a spring gun. only special chamber oil should be used in this area \n\n\nBarrel:\nIf any normal petroleum based lubricant is used this will cause an explosion called dieseling which can very quickly destroy a spring gun. only special chamber oil should be used in this area. Airguns dont use powders or primers so dont suffer from rust but it is important to clean the bore to maintain accuracy,do not use brass brushes  as they can damage the rifling if used too vigorously and once again do not use any petroleum based lubricant or this will destroy your gun by dieseling,use felt cleaning pellets which are like thin cigarette  filter tips and will expand when fired or use dry patch pull throughs till clean and oil free being very carefull not to  rub the crown of the barrel with the pullthru cord. I  fire 6 or 7 thin cigarette felt tips with a pointed  pellet behind them to increase expansion every every 500 shots to remove excees lead build up in the barrel and it  restores accuracy,you will have to fire 5 to 10 shots after cleaning to restore a little lead in the barrel and restore the accuracy (you need a slight coating of lead in the barrel for accuracy).alternatively felt rods may be used once  again being carefull not to rub the crown or barrel with the steel rod.\n\n\nTrigger Mechanism: \nthis should be oiled lightly\n\n\nHinges and pivot bolts: \nthese should be oiled regularly and just one drop should be enough or a small amount of grease can be used.\n\n\nStock Screws and pivot screw\nthese should be checked for tightness and not overtightened as that can ruin the stock.When loose it will ruin your accuracy,if you find they keep coming loose use loctite on the threads\n\n\nNOTE: Diana air rifles are very well built but come from the factory with little or no lube and creak and groan when cocked because the parts are too dry,A rifle that is stripped, deburred, lubed and the mainspring tarred correctly and  molybdenum grease on the sides of the piston  will be a lot smoother,more reliable, last longer and will be a lot more accurate than one that is used in its factory state', 0, 1, '94.169.12.81', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6378, 177211),

But they say that this although has happened that they have been directed my the authorities last week to go to the addresses personally of all those people who''s licences have been issued under fake reciepts(i.e bank challans not paid) and the ministry has the records of those all these licences with their addresses/owner''s names etc as defaulters and have forwarded their lists to the concerned police stations(as the police station name is also in your book/record). So he said maybe the goverment did give some notification in newpaper for people to come themselves to police station so they could just check from the register that if that person''s name is in the defaulter''s list or not. Whereas when asked about any stamp confirming that the licence is verified etc. He said that there is no such instruction of stamping the licence verified etc.\n\nWhen this issue was finally discussed with PS incharge at that time he said that there is nothing to worry about as there is no such instruction from MOI to them yet secondly he further confirmed that if you have a "copy of demand note and bank challan reciept" which was issued to you prior to the issuance of the green book. You should never ever worry about any such procedure of verification etc cos these proof are far more enough to prove you and your licence is legal. He also told that the MOI is only cancelling and creating problem on those licences which have been issued on fake challans. He ended by saying if you are not one of the defaulters than just sleep at night peacefully there will not be any problem\n\n-----------------Well bros thats the maximum development i could get done but-----------to confirm Please call the MOI guys personally and get the complete feedback and if any of you guys knows anybody in your concerned PS.

We will be doing the comparisons on the next trip InshAllah.  The comparisons will be the SigX6, CZ TS, And ofcourse the Beretta 92 Combat.  \nHere are my initial observations so far:\n\n-Parts Fit and finish - 1st Place goes to the SigX6, a very close second is the Beretta 92 Combat, and last is CZTS.  Every part in the SigX6 is made to extreme exacting tolerances and is relentlessly checked at factory over and over.  The same can be said for the Beretta.  In the CZ''s case I am sure each pistol is worked and checked upon; however, not with much scrutiny due to precision investment casting.\n\n-Weight - This is a very big issue when competition shooting as one tries to aim with precision the weight tires the hands to the point of shaking.  Although I didn''t weigh any of these guns I am going by feel.  In this category the CZTS is the lightest hence it takes 1st place.  Second place goes to the Beretta 92 Combat with the SigX6 taking third place.  This issue was also corroborated by a shooter I know who has two Sig X6 and a Beretta 92 Combat.\n\n- Trigger - The main point - the element of surprise.  1st place goes to the CZTS, those that have fired it compare it to smooth as silk and very crisp.  The Sig X6 trigger is also very good at a close Second place, this is due to the Sig''s new SRT trigger setup.  We had a national games participant try out the Sig X6 and he was used to shooting the Sig Xzone pistols.  He stated the trigger was very good due to the element of surprise meaning one is not anticipating the recoil.  Third place (not in my case) goes to the Beretta 92 Combat, its trigger was the stiffest of all though I corrected mine and it still needs more work to make it equal that of the CZTS but since we are talking stock guns third place goes to the Beretta 92 Combat.\n\n- Recoil - This is a very touchy feely subject - everyone has their own opinions on it and here are mine.  1st place went to Beretta 92 Combat due to the low-slide-weight-mass movement.  Second place was quite difficult to judge as both guns have their own advantages relating to recoil.  The CZTS has a very low height build short 5" slide and the Sig X6 has the tall high and mighty 6" hence both have low recoil.  I will leave this area blank so we can come back to it one day.  I may also add that the other gentleman who shoots the Sig XZone did state that the XZone had much less recoil than the SigX6 due to the muzzle weight attachment in the XZone.\n\n- Grip - 1st place goes to the Beretta 92 Combat.  There is no comparison with anything.  The aggressively checkered front strap and the backstrap of the Beretta is.... quite gripping.  Second place goes to the SigX6, it too has very nice fine line checkering especially in the wooden grips.  Third place goes to the CZTS as they basically went with investment casting and one can''t really risk fine checkering in wax injection castings.\n\n- Accuracy - this area i will comment on strictly based on my experience.  I do not have a auto-pistol rest to shoot and test these weapons for accuracy I am only going by what I am able to do with these three.  Obviously, the SigX6 and the Beretta 92 Combat have an advantage with their 6" barrels providing better accuracy and the poor little CZTS seems left out.... NOT BY A LONG SHOT!!!\nI say this - I was able to shoot for the first time with the SigX6 [b]equally[/b] as fast as with my CZTS with accuracy; why, the trigger and weight.  1st place I give to the Beretta 92 Combat in this case because its been the only gun I can shoot them plates faster with!  There I said it - once again this is my experience with these guns, others may have had other variations.\n\n- Sights - 1st place goes to the SigX6 with a very very close second to CZTS (I wish CZ would offer a thinner front blade).  Third place goes to the Beretta 92 Combat; why, well a target gun shouldn''t have three dot sights.  Over all, the sights are very good.  \n\nIn conclusion, my opinion is this - I am for any gun that does for me what I want it to do hit plates and fast and with ease.  Whether its the Mercedes of guns like the Sig X6/Beretta 92 Combat or the Carolla of guns like the CZTS.  Thats it for now, I will update accordingly as I remember more things regarding comparison.', 0, 1, '203.99.48.245', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6380, 177296),

I called him today (as i am not in country right now and couldnt go myself) i asked him to go over there with my younger brother and meet the SHO if he is around and also check with the moharar(cos these are more aware about rule than anybody in the PS as they do all the ancient data entry procedure on the registers still in 21st century :lol: and their brains are usually like a database :D )\n\nWell here is the strange type of statement i have came across from the PS in my area.\n\n"[b]The PS moharar says they are not aware about any such procedure for the verification of the weapon and licence as they have not been directed by their administration department to follow any such excercise specifically[/b]. But they say that this although has happened that they have been directed my the authorities last week to go to the addresses personally of all those people who''s licences have been issued under fake reciepts(i.e bank challans not paid) and the ministry has the records of those all these licences with their addresses/owner''s names etc as defaulters and have forwarded their lists to the concerned police stations(as the police station name is also in your book/record). So he said maybe the goverment did give some notification in newpaper for people to come themselves to police station so they could just check from the register that if that person''s name is in the defaulter''s list or not. Whereas when asked about any stamp confirming that the licence is verified etc. [b]He said that there is no such instruction of stamping the licence verified etc.[/b]\n\n[i]When this issue was finally discussed with PS incharge at that time he said that there is nothing to worry about as there is no such instruction from MOI to them yet secondly he further confirmed that if you have a "[b]copy of demand note and bank challan reciept[/b]" which was issued to you prior to the issuance of the green book. You should never ever worry about any such procedure of verification etc cos [b]these proof are far more enough to prove you and your li[/b][/i][b]cence is legal[/b]. He also told that the MOI is only cancelling and creating problem on those licences which have been issued on fake challans. He ended by saying if you are not one of the defaulters than just sleep at night peacefully there will not be any problem\n\n-----------------Well bros thats the maximum development i could get done but-----------to confirm Please call the MOI guys personally and get the complete feedback and if any of you guys knows anybody in your concerned PS. Have their word as well so we could compare the statements etc-------------------[/quote]\n\n@Eminent bro.........thanks a lot for some practical fieldwork!

I bought baikal 153 few days ago and i took it out for breaking in but the length of pull is bit longer which i believe can be adjusted removing the pad or having a but plate. Since i ma righty, it doesn''t have any cast-off in it,thus, needs a shooting habit change because i don''t bend my head to adjust the 12guage or i can get the but changed. \n\nSecond issue is that the shooting rib seems to be bit low for me.

The lead deposited by pellet is removed when next pellet is fired. Therefore barrel is not a cause of worry. But if you plan to store it.

Patch is a piece of old cotton vest.\n\nNow after 1000 shots main worry is about spring breaking. Do not open up the air rifle stock with driver as this will ruin accuracy. Use a spray clp or gun oil in aerosol and spray using long fine nozzle inside trigger area, the hinge area in center and the sides of the top metal portion in the center. Then leave the oil to drain for 1 night.\n\nNow for inside of piston load air rifle and put 3 drops of silicone oil into it ONLY. After sometime fire it to unload it.

It is chambered for a number of full-size military and hunting cartridges such as 7.62x54mmR, .303 British, .30-06 Springfield, .30 Army, .35 Winchester, and .405 Winchester.\nUnlike most Winchester repeating rifles, which fed from a tube magazine under the barrel, the Model 1895 features a 5-round box magazine located underneath the action. This allows it to chamber military and hunting cartridges with spitzer (pointed) projectiles. The Model 1895 also has a stronger action than traditional lever-action rifles (such as the Winchester Model 94), which means it can handle the increased pressures generated by the more powerful smokeless powder cartridges then entering common use by the military and for hunting.\nThis is a .405 WCF caliber rifle, with a shotgun style butt with rubber pad. Raised dovetail blade front sight and sporting buckhorn rear sight, with the 2-line nickel steel marking on the left side of the barrel and caliber mark behind the rear sight. Markings on the frame are standard, with the two line address and patent marks on the left side, Serial Number on the lower tang and two line model marking on the upper tang. Smooth straight grip stock with Schnabel tip forearm, "B" cut into the underside of the wrist and a crushed recoil pad. \n\nSpecifications:\n•	Cal./Gauge: .405 W.C.F. \n•	Barrel(s): 24" \n•	Weight: 8 Lbs 8 ounces \n•	Sights/Scope: Standard with Lyman side mount. \n•	Stock: American walnut. \n•	Stock Dimensions: LOP: 12 1/2" \n•	Butt/Pad: Crescent steel \n•	Bore Condition: Good, sharp rifling, no rust pitting. \n•	Serial No. 40300\n\nMarkings on the Gun\n•	Nickel Steel Barrel – Specially for Smokeless Powder\n•	Model 1895 Winchester\n•	Trademark Reg.

It is all black with a polycoat fininsh\nIt is a little smaller than the Sig239 and even the Glock 26.\nIts weight is 24 ozs which is about 3 or so ounces heavier than the Glock but a few Ozs lighter than the Sig 239\nThe Slide is Stamped steel and the frame is light Alloy.\nThe Recoil operated Tilt lock system uses the mechanism identical to a Glock as the barrrel locks up with the slide.\nThe barrel is 3 inches long\nSafety sytems:\n  It has a decocking system which drops the hammer to a Half cock position which facilitates the subsequent Double Action firing, this is great advantage as the difference  between the DA and SA  firing is minimised.\nThere is a Firing Pin Block which only releases the firing pin when the trigger is pulled to the more than 3/4 to firing position.\nThe DA pull is a bit heavy ( Guestimate ) about 10 -12 pounds, the SA is about 4 1/2 pounds which on a self defence gun is ideal in my humble opinion. When firing deliberately, aiming on a small target; There are two distinct stages and then just short of firing the clearing of the firing pin block is felt which kind of gives a creepy feel to the trigger but after that there is a complete surprise break which is conssistant.\nIn the DA/ SA when firing rapidly in one smooth pull one can not feel the creep as obviously. \n \nThe Sights\nBoth Front and Rear sights are drift adjustable.\nThe good news is these are Tritium and glow well in the dark, may not be as good as Trijicon but fare when you are not paying for these. The sights are blocky and very visible, I wish we could see light bars on both sides of the front sight by having the rear sight notch wider.\nThe Grip and Slide angle make the gun a natural pointer and lends itself to quick drawing from a holster.\n\nAccuracy\nThe gun was zeroed as when I shot it two handed the 124 grain S&B bullets were landing right in the center of the bull at 15m. I fired  50 shots S&B and all 5 shot groups were in 1.25 to 1.5 inches hands not supported. I then fired a 20 shot group with all bullets landing in the 2 inch 10 ring which means center to center the 20 shot group was well inside 1.75 inches.\nI then fired 25 rds of FN ammo and again all shots were within 1.5 inches but the MPI dropped about 3/4s of an inch.\nIn the Rapid Fire mode the gun behaves well for its size and weight as it jumps up more than its bigger heavier cousins, how ever it is more control able than the Sig239, and imperceptibly the Glock 26 has little less jump but then in rapid fire the SA trigger of the CZ makes up.\nFinal Comments \nI have been carrying Glock17, 19 and 26 since 1984 and the only other gun I carried for SD was a CZ 75, and a Beretta 92 for an year or two. \nI am now sadly parting with the Glocks for the following reasons.\nThe CZs are just more accurate and  as  reliable, although a bit heavier.\nThe BIG REASON is PRICE in PAKISTAN.\nI get a $500 Glock for Rs 280,000/- and the $ 600 Rami for 95000/- in Pakistan. Only an insane person will go for any thing 3 times more expansive and much less accurate.\nI have started carrying my cute and accuracy champion RAMI ''D'' It is not only more accurate than any other pistols of its size, it challenges full sized pistols.\nThe Tac Sport costs $1350 and here 140,000/-, The CZ Czechmate costs nearly $4000/- let us hope we get it for about 250,000/ or so.\nI am not a sales director for CZ or Check Republic but the Dean of all pistoleros late  Colonel Jeff Cooper had declared the CZ 75 as the best hand gun ever made 35 years ago.\nI will post pictures of targets ,the pistol and muzzle velocities with various ammunitions later', 0, 1, '110.36.29.73', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6392, 177664),

[/quote]\n\nAoA Haider\n\nif you are hitting low but your pattern is dead center (horizontally) then all you need is to raise the comb. the objective is to raise the rear sight (in case of a shotgun its the shooter''s eye) so that your pattern is dead center (in other words 50/50). but this mostly depends on shooter''s preference. I like 60/40, meaning 60% of pellets are above the target and 40% of pellets are at target. some may even prefer 80/20.\n\nNow how do we go about raising the comb? THREE SOLUTIONS:\n\n1. you can firmly tape a thick mouse pad on the comb side of a shotgun''s stock. this should raise your comb. you can add another layer if you need to raise it further\n\n2. take off the stock, add layers of aluminum foil (kitchen type) to the underside of the receiver-stock joint. this will also raise your comb\n\n3. THIS METHOD IS PROBABLY THE BEST: go to a gunsmith and ask him to make an aluminum/plastic/carbon fiber/wood/steel shim for you. the shim would go between the receiver and the stock. it would be thin from the top and thick from the bottom. if properly fitted and colored/painted, it would look just like a factory fitted part of the shotgun.\n\nthe following pictures illustrates a homemade shim for Baikal MP153 made out of fiberglass.\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/shimforMP153.jpg[/img]\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.174.227', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6386, 178044),

Sorry for late reply, bec of email problems.\n\n@dr hanif, you are absolutely right in your own way (20 decoys + 1 mojo combo works too) but depends on size of flocks and the expanse of water i.e. how big the open water area is you are hunting. Like in my earlier hunt this season, I saw a phenominal movement of ducks in large numbers on a very wide expanse of water. I had set up my blind in water away from edge of a bareta in the middle of the river using pilchi and then surrounded the blind with 60+ decoys on all sides leaving several open gaps for ducks to use as landing zones. Then I put two Mojos in between the gaps ...you had to be there to see the effect that had on ducks. You know too that ducks very much respond to the way decoys are set too, like crowded decoys close together will send the ducks away more than attract and so on, and similary decoys set in small family groups in an open manner (not crowded) attract more ducks near blind, giving better shots. We were mainly two guns with a third lesser-gunner, and had a real huge bag at end of the shoot. So it is always better to have decoys on the higher side for more open expanses of water, especially when arrival (Sep-Oct) and departure flocks (Feb-Mar) are coming in huge nos.', 0, 1, '110.36.15.214', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5415, 178055),

I didn''t want to mention it on the forum, but just to make a point, I have been hit by an Ak round, .308 from a G3, several times with a buckshot, many a times with a 9mm and .45 round, couple of times with a .357 round, stabbed a few times, hit by grenade shrapnel, hit by a rpg, left to bleed for 45 minutes, and once I was even hit by a DU round, once one buckshot hit me right in the fore head, once I was hit with a shrapnel in what we call in Urdu the "Kanpatti" and many of the veins were severed, yet thanks to the Almighty I still sit here to tell the story. Yet many of my colleague had died from .22 in the head, .22 shot in the heart, once a colleague passed away from bleeding, he was hit in the foot with a rpg shrapnel which exploded about 50 feet away from him, but unfortunately he was hit  in one of the main arteries near the foot.  The point is, there are many firearms and calibers out there, and mods forgive me to mention this here, like the Ak''s and G3''s and .50 BMG''s  (even being used as a sniper round these days) that are extremely powerful and deadly, newer technologies like the Metal Storm concept that can fire up to a million rounds per minute etc, are very much dangerous, lethal, and with extreme ranges, these things and many more out there do exist, but it is your time and luck if that runs out, your are in trouble. I swear to you, once I saw a poor fellow pass away when he was hit by a 30 bore round, and the damnedest thing was the bullet was half in and half out of his body , his ribs stopped the bullet, but he passed away.\n\nSo my humble point was there is no such thing as  the deadliest weapon or projectile, its the will of the Almighty that counts. And that was the reason I asked brother shahroze what was the purpose behind his question, so we can have a more focused debate and exchange of information.\n\nHope this clears what I and Dr sb were trying to say. :)', 0, 1, '115.167.20.197', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6402, 178234),

I didn''t want to mention it on the forum, but just to make a point, I have been hit by an Ak round, .308 from a G3, several times with a buckshot, many a times with a 9mm and .45 round, couple of times with a .357 round, stabbed a few times, hit by grenade shrapnel, hit by a rpg, left to bleed for 45 minutes, and once I was even hit by a DU round, once one buckshot hit me right in the fore head, once I was hit with a shrapnel in what we call in Urdu the "Kanpatti" and many of the veins were severed, yet thanks to the Almighty I still sit here to tell the story. Yet many of my colleague had died from .22 in the head, .22 shot in the heart, once a colleague passed away from bleeding, he was hit in the foot with a rpg shrapnel which exploded about 50 feet away from him, but unfortunately he was hit  in one of the main arteries near the foot.  The point is, there are many firearms and calibers out there, and mods forgive me to mention this here, like the Ak''s and G3''s and .50 BMG''s  (even being used as a sniper round these days) that are extremely powerful and deadly, newer technologies like the Metal Storm concept that can fire up to a million rounds per minute etc, are very much dangerous, lethal, and with extreme ranges, these things and many more out there do exist, but it is your time and luck if that runs out, your are in trouble. I swear to you, once I saw a poor fellow pass away when he was hit by a 30 bore round, and the damnedest thing was the bullet was half in and half out of his body , his ribs stopped the bullet, but he passed away.\n\nSo my humble point was there is no such thing as  the deadliest weapon or projectile, its the will of the Almighty that counts. And that was the reason I asked brother shahroze what was the purpose behind his question, so we can have a more focused debate and exchange of information.\n\nHope this clears what I and Dr sb were trying to say. :)[/quote]\nAre you in Police OR in Army?', 0, 1, '115.167.27.57', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6402, 178291),

I didn''t want to mention it on the forum, but just to make a point, I have been hit by an Ak round, .308 from a G3, several times with a buckshot, many a times with a 9mm and .45 round, couple of times with a .357 round, stabbed a few times, hit by grenade shrapnel, hit by a rpg, left to bleed for 45 minutes, and once I was even hit by a DU round, once one buckshot hit me right in the fore head, once I was hit with a shrapnel in what we call in Urdu the "Kanpatti" and many of the veins were severed, yet thanks to the Almighty I still sit here to tell the story. Yet many of my colleague had died from .22 in the head, .22 shot in the heart, once a colleague passed away from bleeding, he was hit in the foot with a rpg shrapnel which exploded about 50 feet away from him, but unfortunately he was hit  in one of the main arteries near the foot.  The point is, there are many firearms and calibers out there, and mods forgive me to mention this here, like the Ak''s and G3''s and .50 BMG''s  (even being used as a sniper round these days) that are extremely powerful and deadly, newer technologies like the Metal Storm concept that can fire up to a million rounds per minute etc, are very much dangerous, lethal, and with extreme ranges, these things and many more out there do exist, but it is your time and luck if that runs out, your are in trouble. I swear to you, once I saw a poor fellow pass away when he was hit by a 30 bore round, and the damnedest thing was the bullet was half in and half out of his body , his ribs stopped the bullet, but he passed away.\n\nSo my humble point was there is no such thing as  the deadliest weapon or projectile, its the will of the Almighty that counts.

I mean if they are reliable enough to spend money on them.Like kanuni 9mm Stoeger Cougar etc.???????[/quote]\nDear brother\nmanufacturing and mass production of a pistol is not a simple business for any company.  the basic mechanisms of actions are the same for firearms, and each company chooses an appropriate mechanism.  \nStoeger uses a rotary action, many others use classical browning action.  \nthere are only a few innovative guns in the pistol producers.  These are mostly collectors items like a 45 caliber HK P 7.  or matebo automatic revolver etc. \nI believe it is ok to buy a gun from any company who dares to produce pistols and dares to go to international arena. \n Ammunition and magazines play very important roles in the action of a pistol.  \nA very well known pistol such as Luger P 08 may not cycle normally with regular ammunition and may need hotter rounds such as a submachine gun cartridge for reliable action.  This does not make a Luger a bad pistol, and it is still worth buying... I would love to have one for myself...\nAlso a walther 22 caliber pistol may prefer a brand of ammunition over another. It is still a very nice pistol to shoot with\nIt is good to keep these factors in mind when buying a pistol. \nBuy a pistol that you can handle and carry around comfortably.  \nPersonally my hands are not suitable for a Beretta 92, therefore I have always preferred CZ clones.  This does not make Beretta a bad gun.  It is just not suitable for me.', 0, 1, '88.254.133.182', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6283, 178425),

I thought we should have a thread about this hobby which is as age old and classy as firearms. \n\nI would like to start off with a basic introduction/FAQ into the world of watches for friends who are new into this hobby. I am by no means an expert, just a enthusiast and would appreciate if more experienced friends correct any mistakes and add content for a more complete FAQ.\n\n\n[b]What are the different kinds of watch movements ? Which is the best ?[/b]\n\nThere are 3 different kinds of watch movements: Quarts, Winding and Automatic. In a nutshell Quarts watches work with a battery, winding watches get movement energy with winding and Automatic watches (the most complicated) are powered by the movement of the wrist. Almost all true luxury watches are Automatic.\n\n[b]\nWhat makes a watch expensive ? \n[/b]\nThe Pedigree of the watch (Chopard/Rolex), the Materials used (Diamonds/Platinum), Movement, Quantity Built etc.  \n\n\n[b]Is Rolex the best watch in the world ?[/b]\n\nNo. It certainly is among the finest watches in the world but by no means the best. In the world of watches "Best" can translate into many things i.e the most expensive, the most exclusive, the finest crafted, the most precise etc. \n\n[b]\nI keep on hearing the world Chronograph, what is it and do I need a watch with one ?[/b]\n\nA Chronograph is essentially a stopwatch function built into the watch. It started to show up in watches targeted towards motor racing enthusiasts to calculate lap times, it has now become mainstream.\n\n\n[b]Some watches say Waterproof, some say things like 50 M/100 M, what does it mean ?[/b]\n\nWaterproof marked watches generally resist mild splashes of water. 50 M/100 M etc is the depth to which the watch will continue to function correctly and keep the water out. For normal use nothing beyond 100M is needed which is more than enough for use full time use in a swimming pool.\n\n\n[b]So I can Shower / Wuzu with my water resistant watch on ?[/b]\n\nYes, you can but soap / shampoo''s tend to mess up the finish of the watch and damage it in the long run.\n\n\n[b]What are some of the top watch brands in the world ?[/b]\n\nThere are countless watch brands out there, I am aware of some of them of them which I will list here in order of classification and price. \n[b]\nUltra High END:[/b] Ulysse Nardin (My dream watch), Piguet, Patek Phillipe, Vacheron Constantin\n[b]Price Range[/b]: Starting around USD 7500 and priced well into millions of dollars. \n\n\n[b]High End:[/b] Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Ebel, Breitling\n[b]Price Range[/b]: Starting around USD 1000 and easily priced well USD 35,000.\n\n\n[b]Luxury:[/b] Tag Huer, Rado, Raymond Weil\n[b]Price Range[/b]: Starting around USD 500 and easily priced near USD 12,000\n\nIMHO I don''t consider brands such as Movado, Bvlgari, Longines true luxury watches. \n\n\n[b]Ha Ha Ha, I caught a friend wearing a fake watch. He was so embarrassed.[/b]\n\nOwing a replica watch is nothing to be embarrassed about, everyone has different income levels and taste. Not everyone can afford a Rolex or an Omega but that does not mean he should not have the pleasure of wearing a watch that looks just like it. Owning/wearing watches is all about the happiness it brings the wearer, therein lies the true value of the watch.  \n\n\nAnd to end this post I would like to share my fantasy watches with you all. They are both by Ulysee Nardin. If some rich friend of PakGuns is reading this post, sir/madam your anonymous gift would be highly appreciated ;) \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/UlyseeNardin.jpg[/img][img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/UlyseeNardin2.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '115.186.37.103', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6427, 178579),

Power isn''t that great (lesser than local Rainbow airgun I have) and is acceptable for shorter distances... buts it''s comparatively easy to load than Rainbow hence lesser strain on your shoulders.\n \nThat being said, I read somewhere here that to roughly judge FPS of your gun, load and insert a palette, fire at floor from a short distance (1 inch or 1 feet I''m forgetting). Then look at the fired palette. If it is only deformed, then FPS is likely to be less, and if it is as flat as a sticker, then you''re talking 700+ FPS. \n \nFortunately, when done with this gun (1 inch distance approx), my palette (Iranian) was nearly as flat as a sticker.\n \nBoth statements being made, while not claiming for 100% accurate information!

[b]PATTERN TEST THE GUN[/b]. there you go, life cannot be any simpler. [b]now lets not overly complicate a situation[/b]. give Hamid space/time to shoot the gun first.\nRegards.[/quote]\n\nI agree, suggesting a solution without knowing a problem adds to the problem. To make the newbies life simpler i am going to discuss here some general modifications in the DAC and Cast of the gun to make the gun shoot where one aims(POI=POA). It is always necessary that one should know that what one is doing, and what/how much modification is required. Firstly, where do we want to shift the POI(point of impact). \n\n1- Point Of Impact can be shifted UP/DOWN by raising or lowering the comb:\n     a- Raise the comb to raise the POI.\n     b- Lowere the comb to lower the POI.\n2- Point Of Impact can be shifted LEFT/RIGHT by moving the butt left or right(increasing/decreasing the Cast...Please don''t mix it with Cast Off or Cast On):\n     a- Adjust the stock toward left to shift the POI toward left.\n     b- Adjust the stock toward right to shift the POI toward right.\n\nNow to find that how much adjustment in the stock is required we need to pattern the shotgun. Take a large sheet of chart paper, make a colourd 2"-3" circle in the middle and place it on a target stand at 30Yds. Take a deliberate shot aiming at the circle and make sure that you placed your cheek on the comb where you always do. Taking more than one shots would be better. Now check the centre of your pattern, measure its deviation(if there is any) from your point of aim. If there is no deviation there is no need of any modification in DAC and Cast. Let us assume that centre of the POI was 6" low and 4" left from the POA.\nNow we assume that one''s eye was at the distance of 1yrd from the muzzle(keeping in view the barrel length and the distance from breach to the shooters eye). The amount of adjustment can be found in the following way.\n\nDistance of target was    30 Yds\nPlane of sight was          1 Yds \nDeviation in inches          6"Low......4"Left\n\nAdjustment required would be calculated by dividing the deviation in inches by the distance of the target with reference to the sighting plane.\n\nComb needed to be raised  to raise the POI by  6/30 =.2"\n\nButt is needed to be adjusted rightward to bring the POI toward right by    4/30 =.1333"\n\nMake the adjustments,  better by a gunsmith and bang on a target.\n\nI have just added the calculations that are needed to make adjustments, rest of the things in this post have already mentioned by MIAN-50, 12 Gauge and Hamid.

It has a 6 1/2 inch barrel and ''Ribber'' grips. The rear sight is both windage and elevation adjustable & the trigger is SA/DA.\n\nNow that we''ve got that out of the way, first holding the revolving gives a surprising feeling of quality something that is generally not associated with Taurus revolvers. The finish is really nice, the grip although a little small is one of the most comfortable I''ve ever held in a revolver and the balance decent considering it''s a 6 + inch barrel revolver. What really took my by surprise was the trigger, it has the best trigger I have ever fired in a sub 100 K gun. The gun itself is lightweight and about the same weight as Colt and Ruger 4 Inchers.\n\nIt comes with the TSS ( Taurus Security System ) which is essentially a lock on the hammer to make the gun inoperable when locked.  Another interesting feature is the transfer bar mechanism which acts like a firing pin block and prevents the gun from going off unless the trigger is pulled.  \n\nEye Candy and Range report:\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Trakker1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Trakker2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Trakker3-1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Trakker4.jpg[/img]\n\nAt the range the gun was comfortable to shoot, I found the grip a little small and uncomfortable and had to change it several times before each shot to get a grip I was comfortable with. Sight alignment took a couple of shots but the gun was zero''d in right out of the box. Primer strikes were solid and consistent.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Trakker5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Trakker6.jpg[/img]\n\nThe above target was shot by a friend at 15 M. This gun is [u]highly accurate [/u]and simply a tack driver. I was amazed.\n\n[b]Verdict:[/b] These days revolvers are also a hobby piece apart from SD guns hence revolvers fans are generally quite brand conscious. If you can look past the Taurus branding, this is an excellent reasonably priced gun which is great for home defense and great fun at the range.', 0, 1, '115.186.37.103', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6432, 178871),

I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\n\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further but CZ 999 Scorpion is not bad at all. infact, DA to SA transition is much more smoother in CZ 999 than in Baikal. baikal''s trigger in DA is mode is down right painful.\n\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that [b]its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary[/b]. \n\n[b]CZ 999 Scorpion[/b]\n\nA time proven design that has faced the most critique of consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\n\nA design that has seen the rigors of war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. showing that the product matured and/or incorporated the lessons learned. its been in the market (international) for quiet sometime now. whereas Baikal MP446 Viking has seen no war. it has not been exported to US. it is relatively a newer product. there is no time proven history/track record to backup any claims by Baikal users.\n\nThe barrel of the [b]CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking[/b]. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, [b]it is chromed lined from inside and outside[/b]. some say it is a sign of durability, I''ll say not necessarily. but I would rather have inside and outside chroming instead of only inside chroming. both barrels are hammer forged by the way.\n\nthe [b]rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking[/b]. I do not what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\n\nwhen it comes to handguns, barrel isnt everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel inserts. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. I would not say, that it is not solid or strong but I will say this that Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\n\nnow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. but thats not the end of it. there are other controls too that are quiet as important, CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive. Racking a Baikal not only requires considerable force but also requires you to carefully watch where you are placing your fingers as it has one hell of an ability to leave a permanent mark (in shape of a wound) if you are not careful enough. rough edges and sharp corners are the culprit here. in CZ 999 Scorpion, you may rack the gun with your teeth if want to. smooth as silk and requires very little force. you can even rack the slide by just grabbing the gun with its sights (i''m not recommending it, only saying to make a point).\n\none more thing I would like to add in defense of CZ 999 Scorpion. take the manual of CZ 999 Scorpion and you''ll find the handgun being referred to as a combat handgun whereas in Baikal MP446 Viking''s case, it is being referred to as "Sporting and Training Pistol". what does that tell ya? I know  :( \n\nBottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):\n\nin my view, Baikal is all about durability (I''m just going with the most popular opinion) whereas CZ 999 scorpion which ([b]possibly but not necessarily[/b]) compromises very little on durability but also takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when I go to a store to buy a pair of boots, I buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t I go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip my feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different. any tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\n\nhowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day (with an unconfirmed but sadly most popular assumption that Baikal is built like a tank, [b]NOT A FACT[/b]). however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers alot more than just durability so do look into it.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.174.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5397, 178872),

He was sent regularly to IBM region office which was back then initially in India for training and from then onwards to Brussels and UK.  I remember the reel to reels, and the punch cards (binary) machines and the terminals.  There was a main frame room always very very cold, in the Habib Bank Plaza, I believe IBM had three floors there back then.  I remember the IBM yearly company parties.... wow, can I remember them, jam packed company events full of foreigners as well as the affluent local employees Karachi.

He had overseen the installation of the main frame in QaideAzam University and the main frame installation in PAF Airbase in Badaber Pesh., where the supposed famous U2 spy planes flew from. Since there was no knowing of when or if there would be upward mobility, he transferred to IBM Kuwait, there he was the CE field manager overseeing operations of Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq.  He took a Handshake in 1991 after the Gulf war and IBM pulled out.  Since then he has been living the retired life in Canada... although I wouldn''t call it retirement as he is always fixing things.... MashAllah, Allah always bless him.   As some of his retired secretaries put it... throughout his career he always stuck with his principles regardless of career or anything... it was very common for a meeting to be cancelled or postponed due to prayer timings or family matters.

SP-01 is a pretty universal product and quiet well known around the world. the weight alone should be enough to conclude that its made out of steel. anyways, with a product of such international fame, you can easily find qualified sources/statement/facts from the INTERNET. :)\n\nby the way, the frame is made out of steel through a process called investment casting and if you are into marketing and know how to make an effective sales pitch then you''ll know why its called precision investment casting. this process is used instead of CNC machining to save manufacturing costs and time. downside is that this process produces casts which can potentially degrade quality and strength as many flaws are introduced when molten metal is poured into casting then subsequently cooled back into solid state. flaws such as porosity, shrinkage, Stressed Induced Cracks and Cavity, to name a few can cause catastrophic failures where high stress and precision mechanics are involved.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.174.46', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6323, 179141),

(162319, 4538, 157411, 'Abbas', 1, '', 1291148431, 'Salams, now that we are almost done with upgrading PG lets continue this useful thread. I would also like to mention that I intended this thread to be more of a watch knowledge sharing thread rather than a I have 15 Rolex''s. \n\nSince Rolex seems to be the hot favorite, let me share a well written piece on Rolex models by the people at [URL]http://www.bernardwatch.com/[/URL]\n\n[B]Air-King:[/B] The Air-King could be considered the "entry level"  model from Rolex.  Current models retail for $4550 with the smooth bezel  fitted, $4600 with the engine turned bezel, or $5,525 with the White  Gold bezel.  It is 34mm in diameter and comes with an Oyster bracelet by  default.  The Air-King does not have a Date.  In the 1970s, the  Air-King was offered with a date (scarce!) and in gold & steel  combinations.  Those two variations likely ceased production since they  are redundant next to the Date and Oyster Perpetual models.\n\n[B]Date:[/B] The Rolex Date is 34mm like the Air-King, but it  obviously includes a date function.  Its production began in the late  1950s, around the time the steel Datejust was introduced. Retails range  from $5,625 with a smooth bezel and Oyster bracelet to $7,400 with an  18K white gold fluted bezel and diamond markers.  The date model was  once offered in 3 flavors: steel, 18k yellow & steel, and all 18k  yellow gold.   It is now only available in steel . \n\n \n [B]Datejust:[/B] The Datejust is the best selling Rolex model on the  market, and has been for decades.  It was first introduced in 1945.  The  gents model is 36mm in diameter and typically came on a Jubilee  bracelet. Rolex seems to have changed their tradition on this and is  sending more Datejust models out the door with the Oyster band.  Models  with smooth bezels are available, but less common.  Most have the fluted  bezel, which is 18k white gold on the steel model. \n\nThe Datejust was only available in gold until 1957 (conveniently a year  after the release of the Day-Date which still has never seen a steel  model). The steel Datejust was introduced and became an instant success.   Rolex soon saw the steel variations selling much quicker than their  gold models.  Rolex countered this in 1962 when they introduced the gold  and steel version.\n[URL="http://www.bernardwatch.com/Rolex/Datejust"]\n[/URL]\n [B]Ladies Date/Datejust:[/B] These two models use the same 26mm case  mold and offer the exact same functionality. Rolex discontinued the  ladies Date, there was so much overlap in the models that it seemed long  overdue.   Retails range from $5525 for the most current 171960 steel  Datejust.  The more popular Datejust with White gold bezel retails for  $6,400.  The Gold & Steel models start at $7575 (179173) and go up  to $12,375 for a 179313 with diamond mother of pearl dial and 12 diamond  bezel. \n \n[B]Explorer:[/B] It was introduced in 1954, and has had one look  through-out its life; a black dial with Arabic numbers at 3'', 6'' and 9'',  no date, smooth bezel, Oyster bracelet, and a stainless steel 36mm  case.  Except for the updates that all Rolex watches have received, it  remained essentially the same watch.  Today the watch retails for  $5,725.  Rolex has announced an update to a 39mm case for the Explorer\n\n[B]Explorer II:[/B] This model was introduced in the early 70''s and was  never widely distributed or popular until 1991.  The original model was  produced until the current model was released in 1985.  The Explorer II  uses the same movement as the GMT-II models and makes use of a secondary  24-hour hand that rotates once every day.  The engraved steel bezel is  stationary and was originally designed for speleologists (cave  explorers) who can have a hard time determining if it is am or pm. Today  it retails for $6,325 and comes with only one choice: a black or a  white dial. [URL="http://www.bernardwatch.com/Rolex/Explorer"]\n[/URL]\n \n[B]Oyster Perpetual:[/B] An odd name for a model considering every  Rolex mentioned on this page is also an Oyster Perpetual...  By itself,  the "Rolex Oyster Perpetual" was basically the same as the smaller 34mm  Air-King model.  The Current Oyster Perpetual (no-date) is now the same  size as the Datejust and comes only in steel or steel with white gold  bezel.  Rolex has introduced several unusual dials for this model.    Retails start at $4,350 for the simplest ladies Oyster Perpetual and  $4,750 for the simplest men''s Oyster Perpetual. Both come standard with  an Oyster bracelet. \n\n[URL="http://www.bernardwatch.com/Rolex/Oyster"]\n[/URL]\n [B]Submariner:[/B]  The Submariner was introduced by Rolex in 1954.   The watch comes only on an Oyster bracelet and has a 40mm case.  The  steel model is only available with a black dial, and is one of the most  recognizable Rolexes.  Anniversary editions with green bezels can  occasionally be found.   The Submariner has the common single direction  rotating diving bezel with minute markers for the first 15 minutes. The  original models until 1958 are often considered "James Bond" models and  have some easily recognizable difference. Primarily, they had a smaller  crown, no crown guard, and the bezel only had minute markers every 5  minutes.  In the late 70s the model 16800 was introduced.  It sported  the new sapphire crystal and quick-set function.  In 1989, the 16610 was  introduced with an improved movement and a more secure bezel.  In 2010,  the 116610 was introduced with a ceramic (Cerachrom) bezel and improved  &#8220;Glidelock&#8221; buckle.   The Submariner is one the most popular models and  comes in 4 styles, $5,825 for steel (no date), $6,000 for steel (with  date), $7375 for the new Ceramic model,  $11,250 for 18k & steel,  and $28,850 for the yellow gold model or $33,800 for white gold.\n[URL="http://www.bernardwatch.com/Rolex/Submariner"]\n[/URL]\n [B]Sea Dweller:[/B] The Sea Dweller was introduced in 1971 and  discontinued in 2008.  It is virtually the same watch as the Submariner.   The only real differences are the thicker and heavier steel case,  thicker crystal with no cyclops eye, and the helium escape valve useful  only to deep divers.  The original model was rated for 2000 feet and  called the "Rolex Submariner 2000 Sea Dweller".  It lost the "Submariner  2000" part of the title in 1973.  The current issue, model 16600, is  rated to 4000 feet and is sold only in steel for a $6,400 retail.  The  Sea-Dweller DEEPSEA, model 116660, has replaced the Sea-Dweller model  16600 and retails for $9,800.  The DEEPSEA model offers a greater depth  rating (to 12,800 feet) along with a thicker, larger case and an  improved "Glidelock" buckle\n \n[B]GMT-Master:[/B]  The 1950s were an exciting decade for Rolex and  included the introduction of the classic GMT- Master.  It was one of the  first watches to utilize a second hour hand to indicate a second time  zone.  With the simple rotating 24 hour bezel, one could fairly easily  tell the time in any time zone.  The late 70s saw the introduction of  the GMT-Master II which was basically the same, except now the user  could easily adjust the 2nd hour hand with the crown in position 2.  The  steel models are only offered with black dials.  The bezels are  available in all black, red/ black, or red / blue.  GMT''s typically come  with a Jubilee bracelet installed. \n\nThe original GMT-Master (16700) was phased out in the late 90s.  The  latest serial number Bernard''s had for the 16700 was a U#, putting its  birthday around 1997.  With the flood of new models with a second time  zone function from other manufactures, retiring it was a smart move, as  most consumers will want to adjust the 2nd hour hand. \n \n \n\nThe GMT-Master II (16710) was discontinued in 2008 and replaced with  the GMT-Master II (116710) The primary difference besides the 3186  caliber movement with Parachrom Bleu hairspring is the ceramic  (Cerachrom) bezel.  Some late production 16710s have been discovered  with the 3186 movement. \n \n \n\nThe GMT-Master II retails for $7,275 in steel, $10,875 in steel & gold, and $27,200 for solid gold.\n[URL="http://www.bernardwatch.com/Rolex/GMT-Master"]\n[/URL]\n [B]Daytona / Cosmograph:[/B]  The story of the Rolex Cosmograph could  be called the most chaotic of all the Rolex Oyster models.  Rolex is  keen on creating a winning product.  The watch never really got off the  ground until 1986 when the market for them exploded and the watches  would often sell for double the retail price in Italy.  The "Paul  Newman" models manufactured around 1967 were and still are the most  desirable of the Daytona models fetching prices over $30,000. It  retailed for around $150 back then. In 1989, Rolex replaced the Valjoux  workhorse movement with the Zenith El Premiro movement.  During the  1990s, the Daytona was the only Rolex model not using a Rolex movement.   In 2000 came the newly developed Rolex caliber 4130 with a 72 hour  power  reserve.  The steel 116520 retails at $10,400.  Steel and Gold  models retail for $16,400 and all 18K yellow gold for $29,500.   Steel  Daytona''s have consistently sold for more than retail since the 1980s.  The two-tone and gold models do not sell for over retail, unlike their  steel counterparts.', 1, 0, '115.186.46.7', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Since I have moved and my company of friends is 12 hours drive from Lahore, after a major break I decided to set my own little shop up and go out duck hunting. \n\nFirst question that I did not know and still do not know the right answer to is : \n1. Everyone has decoy setup, so I built one and keep on building it as I do not think there is any right number, I started with 36. \n2. Rigging them with weights is not straight forward because, thread tangle and cause delay in setting them up. I have decided to use a nylon thread that I got from Corel on Wahdat road. Use them and dispose them. Keep the weights and keep the decoys.\n3. Concealment is the most important things, camouflage--- the more the better \n4. Wader, very handy and useful thing \n5. Call a department I am very weak in, will try to use speakers and recorded sounds\n\nNext question I tried to figure out is, when is the right time. Most of experienced people know but I realized this after comeback without a single duck on the first trip. More wind, less shine, mornings of moon lit nights, colder, low visibility.  \n\nAreas to pick from : \nI figured : Ravi and surrounds  will be good before 15th of November and then in January. \nI yet have to figure out the Chennab area, hopefully we will local support ( a must ) soon \ni will post more details for novices from time to time and may be we can bunch together some time. \n\nSteps I will take to improve is :\nto figure which type moves when... So far I know teal moves first and starts to move in September, Peaks in October. \nto survey local area a day or two before, find someone who has worked with hunters first. \nto know 20 yards from 35 yards :-) I am sure I will get better at this \nto adjust drop of my gun a little -- took time to figure that this is the most important thing to setup for shotguns :-) \nto buy more moving decoys\n\nThe gun I use and I am loving it now is Baikal MP 155, besides all the horror stories of this not reloading, not being able to fire straight, low quality etc. I found this gun to be super fantastic for the cost when next good gas will be plus of 200,000 plus. From first fire to all the others, I heard you have to fire 100 first to kind of break the gun, not a single  time I had an issue of reload. \n\nNow I need to fit adjust the drop using the shims. I suggest all new hunter to study this and your scores will improve by a huge number. Next thing to master is the "swing". \n\n\n\nFew useful links : \n\n[URL]http://www.gma.vic.gov.au/education/shotgunning-education/section-2-understanding-your-tools-and-environment[/URL]\n\n[URL]http://www.gma.vic.gov.au/education/shotgunning-education/section-3-sharpen-your-skills[/URL]\n\n[url]http://www.huntingnet.com/fieldjournal/fieldjournal_detail.aspx?nID=452[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.browning.com/customerservice/qna/detail.asp?id=129[/url]\n\n\n\nI will look forward to talking with other serious beginners to form a strong hunting group around.', 1, 0, '116.58.46.188', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This larger bore increases the volume of the barrel that results in lower pressure/lesser deformation of pallets/lesser recoile and a larger bore also makes the shot string less longer. Combine this with longer choke tubes they also provide more gradual and longer constriction that results in better distribution and lesser deformation of the pallets hence a better pattern.', 0, 1, '175.110.19.231', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6184, 179353),

Type 77 pistol is intended as a self-defense weapon for officers of Chinese army (PLA) and police. It has been developed in the late 1970s and was officially adopted circa 1981. Military issue Type 77 pistol shall not be confused with much bigger and much more powerful 9mm NORINCO Type 77B pistol, available commercially and made in China only for export purposes.\n\nType 77 pistol is a blowback weapon, with striker-fired single action firing mechanism. The only unusual feature is a so-called Chylevsky device, made in the form of a separate front (vertical) part of the trigger guard. This device (originally developed by the Swiss designer Chylevsky in the first decade of the XX century) is used to load and cock the weapon by using only one hand. To do so, shooter must pull the front part of the trigger guard by its index finger. As it is connected to the slide, this pull will retract the slide back, and upon the release of the finger, the slide and front part of the trigger guard will return forward, chambering the cartridge and making the gun ready to fire single action. To avoid damage to the index finger, moving part of the trigger guard is automatically locked forward when trigger is pressed. If the gun is to be carried "cocked and locked", it also features a traditional manual safety on the frame, above the left grip panel. Single stack magazine holds 7 rounds of ammunition. magazine release button is located at the bottom of the trigger guard, on the left side of the frame.

You then quietly make your way to the part of the house where you think you heard the noise from.

First of all, let me tell you, majority, if not all, Police Stations around the country have not received any specific orders regarding this [b]public notice![/b]\n\n[b]Bear in mind, this is just a public notice. The relevant departments must receive specific notice on procedures required for the verification purposes. They have not received special instructions yet, so we therefore have no other options than to satisfy ourselves with the registration in the PS record only. Thus, the Police personnel telling you that they have no instructions, is telling you right. You should then just ask for a plain entry as per routine only.[/b]\n\n[b]Now, let''s come to the second part regarding the stamp. The Police Station must put a stamp in your book confirming that the license/weapon is entered in their record, just like the DCO office does put a stamp, mentioning date, file number of record entry, etc. That is vital and will help you during routine checks.[/b]\n\n[b]Finally, as regards your homecoming and continued refusal by Police for entry of lic/weapon, I suggest you type an application to the SHO of your local PS, mentioning your wish to  comply with said MOI notice, dated 6/9/2010. Also mention your license number and weapon number, and do mention that you''ve been refused the same earlier at this and that date, etc.[/b]\n\n[b]Attach a photocopy of your license, NIC, along with a photocopy of the said notice, and just somehow make the PS stamp reception of your application and keep a copy of that. If possible, meet the SHO personally and present him the application by yourself. If he still refuses, at least ask him to do it written on that application, so you''ve a proof that you did all you could. [/b]\n\n[b]If at any time the government proceeds with specific modes of verification, you''ll have your proofs that you did approach the relevant authority but were refused. It is not our headache if they don''t know which procedure to follow, so take it all light- minded and do not worry.

The base price, that is before taxation, is pretty low, and if it is the same as international prices, it''s the importers who''re bagging the extra, by accepting non-warranted goods at low prices, and selling at the price of warranted.  :) \n\nFurthermore, may I add, in order to make warranty service effective, it would be required that all international brands/makers have a local service center, where the complaints could be dealt with. You cannot expect that a weapon would be sent back all the way to the country from where it was exported, to address the fault.

Anyhow, its part of life and it happens sometime.\n\nInteresting part of this episode which i feel important to share everybody here for the sake of carefulness is that i lost them in just 100 yards. I took 3 dozen decoys that day along with a mojo and count them back while recovering the spread after the game.\nWe used a boat to reach the spot which carried us from 100 yards distance from my car. When we reached back i took mojo, gun and game-bag and reached to my car. \n\nThe other two stayed there to tie-up the boat at the river bank. That was the time where i made the mistake and they find time to stole them, they simply took 5 decoys opening the zip and let them in boat which was 6 feet down in water from ground level and get back to me. They put decoy bag in opened diggee while I was busy in changing clothes.\n\nAs soon as i reached home and took off the decoys bag, i got everything in a minute because during years i have become familiar with the level of my carry bag according to duck count. \n\ni counted them and find 5 of them were missing. There was no doubt in my mind how and when i lost them but to save some relations u have to secrify some loving things.\n\nIt was just to share here to buddies to be carefully as far as your hunting belongings are concerned. Actually, we are facing problems since year that locals often stole your cartridges whenever they find chance or ask for them but now they have been modernized and they have their own decoys and calls etc. and know all technics better than a common hunter, so such thing are now getting more attractive for them which is beyond our expectations hence chances of loosing your belongings are too high these days. \n\nI got a lesson out of it and try to me more careful in future.\nCheeeeeeeeeers', 0, 1, '119.63.128.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5415, 179577),

I forced him to tell me who will way forthe repairs but he kept dogging the answer.[/quote]\n\nYou''re right, but that is mainly due to customs, etc. Weapons would have been far more expensive if warranty was included. The base price, that is before taxation, is pretty low, and if it is the same as international prices, it''s the importers who''re bagging the extra,[b] by accepting non-warranted goods at low prices, and selling at the price of warranted. [/b] :) \n\nFurthermore, may I add, in order to make warranty service effective, it would be required that all international brands/makers have a local service center, where the complaints could be dealt with. You cannot expect that a weapon would be sent back all the way to the country from where it was exported, to address the fault. That is one major issue.  :) \n\nTo be honest - and I mean no offence - giving warranties to Pak Market would bankrupt the makers!  ;)[/quote]\n\nIF thats the Case then there shud be serious Doubts abt the products that are being imported without warranties!!\nthats actually pretty alarming!\nRefurbed, used, defective pieces Might be coming in and the poor customer is getting Ripped off.\n\nAlso i honestly dont understand How one weapons Priced 500-600 USD is Sold at 300k and Another Priced 600-700K is Sold at 90k, and yet others priced 300-400 USD are Sold at 40-55k price ranges.....its all hanky panky if u ask me....and we as Customers shud ask For warranties.( its pretty unlikely well need t use them, but its a Right that we are being denied)\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '116.71.169.208', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 6437, 179705),

As he needed to pick up something, I went for a little browse in the shops and behold I came across an NIB Piranha-F (same batch as Chief''s and Moeen bhai''s). This pistol is an amazing shooter and now that it is discontinued for a full steel version CZ SP01 lookalike version, finding an NIB was a done deal the moment I held it and had a good look. Moeen bhai rightly said that it is a rare find and as no more are coming to PK I shouldn''t miss on it if I have even a slightest doubts (that I didn''t). Having an empty licence in hand made it all too easy a decision.\r\n\r\nShe is in absolutely mint condition with not a single fault or even a minor scratch anywhere inside or out. Even frame to slide rail is scratchless. Trigger break is crisp and abs creep free! After 2 years of wanting and looking for one, I finally have her... as I''m also picking up a NIB CZ Tactical Sport, there were a few seconds of doubt on the TS but it was committed for (& backing out on a committed deal is downright rude & insulting) and furthermore it will be modified by the one and only Moeen bhai in upcoming months. He plans to outdo his previous customised LiteSpeed and Thunderbolt TS''s with this one.\r\n\r\nI also witnessed Moeen bhai''s skills on a particular item today that left me speechless! He''s not only Big and Sexy but a master guru when it comes to gunsmithing. I strongly believe that he''s a real treasure to PG community. I have yet to come across anyone who can think they way he does when it comes to guns and then successfully implement those ideas.\r\n\r\nHigh res pics of my new slick babe to follow soon.\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33119[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33120[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33121[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33122[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33123[/ATTACH][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThose internal slide rails are quite the interesting thing.

A specie that was NOT banned two years ago (like surkhab, barheaded goose etc) here in Punjab and pics posted about those in that period are entirely within the legal ambit and no cause for worries for anybody, at forum or outside. Besides, personally speaking, I don''t take these things very seriously --- I consider more serious issues like [B]netting [/B](please see video ... [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kHREs6bJ1o&feature=related[/url] ... as it is now very common and the main cause of worry), [B]pesticides [/B](as they have wiped partridge populations also), [B]habitat [/B](bela in case of partridge & water/wetlands in case of waterfowl) & [B]localized poaching [/B](with different methods of both waterfowl & partridge), to be of much more magnitude first. Frankly speaking, we as sport loving people are naturally inclined to be worried about the game''s future, and genuine shotgunning on gamebirds does very minimal damage as compared to major hazards mentioned above.\n\nBut, these updates on Wildlife Act come every year; the amendment in THE ACT was only made in 2007 October which I pasted; after that every year different updates vide notifications about hares, pigeons, doves etc have come from time to time, and changed yearly as per ground figures of wildlife (if I am not wrong). IT WOULD BE A NICE IDEA IF THIS THREAD IS USED TO INFO ABOUT LATEST UPDATES (OR AMENDMENTS IF ANY) FROM TIME TO TIME TO KEEP ALL MEMBERS INFORMED.\n\nYou see, there is a much different trend in the last few years. Local people have started poaching excessively with baits/nets/lures for meat or illegal trade. And the onus of that has fallen on shikaris which is definitely not just. That gets reflected in these wildlife act amendments and updates too. I think the whole system needs re-thinking. Pls correct me if I am wrong.[/QUOTE]\n\nAll you wrote above is absolutely correct and THE TRUTH. \nHowever, regarding the ACT and its yearly updates, I personally feel a step-motherly attitude of ----------- concerned, towards the genuine gunners, who try their best to observe the prevalent laws and regulations,and still are blamed for someone else''s actions.(Law observers and law breakers).\nPerhaps, we have gone into a habit of applying cosmetics instead of medicine, to wounds, and tying horses and donkeys in the same stable.\nYour analytical comment on this will be highly appreciated. \nRegards.', 1, 0, '182.177.83.105', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This still [b]without[/b] the warranty!  :mad: In fact, the importer is still making more, in that they take the guns without warranties! \n :mad: \n\nHence, we''ll never get wiser on this issue!!\n\nAs regards the quality of the guns being imported, well, there''s nothing to worry about, we''re getting the same quality, just without the "gambling" part and added cost!\n\nFinally, on the prices questions above. Well, as regards your first example of the $5-600 gun at $300, it only confirms my opinion above, that this is due to non-warranted items.\n\nAs regards the $700 gun at 90K, I feel, the price of the CZ''s in the USA has deliberately been kept high, as to give local US guns, a fairer chance, even though CZ has a US manufacturer/distributor base, whatsoever. \n\nA $500K Glock is for $3000K here, now this is quite a different scenario, where export restrictions come into the play.\n\nSo, as you can see, no matter how much we ponder on these  market variables, getting any wiser is literally impossible, only fact ascertainable being that just pay your way through to your desired item!!\n\nIndeed, the customer is the Bakra here, and I agree warranties should be included.

I am back in country and i ll follow the procedure you recommended me, I ll definately find one way or other to atleast get a stamp on the licence thru this procedure so i could have a proof that its been entered and registered with the local PS. Hopefull i ll follow up and write over here about my developments. I know its gonna be a project and i am short of time. But i am not going back unless i get it registered from PS. Cos only after that i ll have some peace on mind when i am not around in Pakistan.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=AK47;158273][b]@Eminentpk[/b]......... First of all, let me tell you, majority, if not all, Police Stations around the country have not received any specific orders regarding this [b]public notice![/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Bear in mind, this is just a public notice. The relevant departments must receive specific notice on procedures required for the verification purposes. They have not received special instructions yet, so we therefore have no other options than to satisfy ourselves with the registration in the PS record only. Thus, the Police personnel telling you that they have no instructions, is telling you right. You should then just ask for a plain entry as per routine only.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Now, let''s come to the second part regarding the stamp. The Police Station must put a stamp in your book confirming that the license/weapon is entered in their record, just like the DCO office does put a stamp, mentioning date, file number of record entry, etc. That is vital and will help you during routine checks.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Finally, as regards your homecoming and continued refusal by Police for entry of lic/weapon, I suggest you type an application to the SHO of your local PS, mentioning your wish to  comply with said MOI notice, dated 6/9/2010. Also mention your license number and weapon number, and do mention that you''ve been refused the same earlier at this and that date, etc.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Attach a photocopy of your license, NIC, along with a photocopy of the said notice, and just somehow make the PS stamp reception of your application and keep a copy of that. If possible, meet the SHO personally and present him the application by yourself. If he still refuses, at least ask him to do it written on that application, so you''ve a proof that you did all you could. [/b]\r\n\r\n[b]If at any time the government proceeds with specific modes of verification, you''ll have your proofs that you did approach the relevant authority but were refused. It is not our headache if they don''t know which procedure to follow, so take it all light- minded and do not worry.

The ones stood out to me most were, the Beretta Neos, Sig Mosquito, Norinco M93 (Colt Woodsman clone), Ruger 22/45, and Buckmark. Out of those, the Ruger and Browning were the most recommended. Browning''s build quality and finish are impeccable and I also like how its an all metal gun, unlike the 22/45 was has a polymer frame. But if you don''t care about the frame material, there are still 2 other areas where the Browning clearly wins out over the Ruger. The first is the controls. The Buckmark has very nice extended safety and frame lock levers, whereas the Ruger has "buttons" that are flush with the frame, making them very difficult to manipulate. Second is magazine ejection. Both guns have a magazine disconnect safety (which I hate), but on the Ruger it seems to impede the ejection of the magazine. On the Buckmark however, the mag still manages to shoot out with impressive velocity regardless. They said the Ruger would eject just as well when broken in, but when something works perfectly out of the box, that goes a long way in making a good impression. With that said, the disconnect can be easily removed on both guns, its not something I would do to a brand new gun in order not to void the warranty. \n\nSo...

Anyways, This article taken from an Italian magazine testifies the "Built like a Tank" reputation of a shotgun that has won the prize of "The 100 Best Russia''s Products " at IHF International Fair (Cologne, Germany), recognized as gun of the year by two popular gun magazines in the United States "Sports Afield" and " Guns & Ammo" and sold in US under the banner of Remington (Spartan) and EAA, The Baikal MP153 Semiautomatic Shotgun.\r\n\r\n[B]"Article from the periodical “ARMI e TIRO”, August 2005, p. 67-75\r\n[I]Translated from the Italian to English[/I][/B]\r\n\r\n*******************************\r\nUs they told, “hunting gun is not created for this quantity of shots”. Us they told, “on no account not to have time in five days”. They told us, “not one province you to itself will release, yes even where you will find so many cartridges”. They told us, “you [rekhnulis] that into this they got involved in”. Us they told all this and much other, but we did not believe.\r\n\r\nAnd they decided then to conduct the firing test: to produce 50,000 shots from the semiautomatic gun Baikal MR-153, caliber 12 gauge, from which year ago it was possible to overcome threshold into ten thousand shots; however, this time in the modification “Of synthetic”, with the polymer fittings [lozhoy]. Briefly stated, from the plastic. Why “Baikal”? The call to preconception, which should have been dethroned. The call, which “the tonic By [armi]”, the importer of Russian guns, received without the fluctuations.\r\n\r\nIn the phase of preparation for the tests, we made two calculations and they stated: young hunter, let us say twenty-year old, the possessor of license, acquires gun “Baikal”, whose cost is low, and which at first behaves excellently. It detonates somewhere 100 cartridges per year, this pleases it and it continues to shoot at hundreds of cartridges of the following 50 years to the deserved pension (hunter, it is understood). Actually this composes 5,000 shots, plus minus several cartridges. Let us add that sometimes, in order to warm the stem before the opening, are produced several shots in the field, so to say “entrance”. At the end “the quarries” of gun this will hardly exceed 10,000 additional shots. For this reason, we began to think that in actuality hunting the gun is not projected in order to reach the specific limits. But we did not refuse from the idea: “to go” to fifty thousand.\r\n\r\nHowever, us there were only five, and if we calculate: ten thousand cartridges during the day, thousand an hour, about fifteen per minute. Plus two hours for the installation/dismantling and several cleanings, taking into account that speech goes about one semiautomatic gun with the selection of solid-reactant gases, in which the residual substances of combustion can cause the disturbance of the normal cycle of recharging. As a result, were obtained twelve hours during the day during five days. To overpower it is possible.\r\n\r\nPractically everything was preparedly, were not sufficient only gun, shooting-range and 50.000 cartridges. The gun of MR-153 arrived after several days, new, sparking, with the wishes “successful work” from “tonic By [armi]”. Concerning ammunition, we " took course” for the firm “[Fiokki]”: “you will isolate to us 50,000 cartridges for the testing”. They raised us for a joke. We insisted, and before face of this “folly”, everyone agreed to lengthen to us hand aids “good, take that which to you is necessary”. After securing gun and cartridges, it remained to find only the shooting-range, in which will sound the music of 50,000 shots. To us “approached” [Karisio]. Preference was returned to [pemontskomu] field - historical possession of the family Of [lukyari].\r\n\r\nIf it transports…\r\n\r\nIt is improbable: testing began on Monday in the morning at the end June, but when we reached field into [Karisio], came [paduanskaya] autumn, in no way summer breeze and rain, which went with the increasing force. I, [Massimo], Enrico and [Dzhankarlo], the first four selected for “the baptism” of Baikal, did not hide their disappointment, but the desire “to give motion” operation took precedence. Before us five long days and each uncertainty could tear away program. They approached the shooting: on the right hand from the central route the pan, to is boundary filled with day dose into ten thousand cartridges, from the other side - bath, high tide, for the forced cooling of stem. These special features are the basic difference from the testing for ten thousand shots, which passed year ago (cm July release “[Armi] e of shooting ranges” in 2004) whereas, when into the first day we turned themselves to the natural cooling, which occurred extremely slowly, before passing to the forced cooling with the aid of the compressor, to effective, but it is insufficient to rapid. After the first 200 - 300 shots (bad weather gave the advantage that the temperature of ambient air was below) in order not to lead the temperature of stem to the red heat, we conducted the first of sinking stem during fifteen seconds, after which stem could be extracted, without fearing to anneal hands. And this regime was repeated again and again.\r\n\r\n“Baikal” behaved excellently, furthermore, the experience of one year learned to the following: using such “calm” cartridges as “Top Of trap of black” of firm “[Fiokki]”, 28 grams of lead, are better to first produce running-in by the five-ten times intensive cartridges, for example [magnumom] with 42 grams of lead. After this, problems no longer it appeared, taking into account that MR-153 " shoots” cartridges from 28 to 56 grams of lead and that which with the aid of the simple operation of the adjustment of the valve, located inside the cylinder of gas bleed, gun was able to also " overcure” 24 grams.\r\n\r\nIs already past fourteen hours since we began to shoot - it impresses balance: on the table remained only several boxes on 25 cartridges from the day portion of 10,000 cartridges plus remainders from the first two days, only 13,000 cartridges minus some trifles. In other words, we completely made up that missed, and they entered “into the track”.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day entered “into the narrow gauge”: I and Alex profit in the field, when [Massimo] already he approached the shooting, but to us was three together not to the jokes. Around us heat, which makes even by more tiresome and which, even at the height of the morning, it seemed, melts the ears, protected by head sets. Let us regret about the rains of previous days. “Baikal” passed lustrously the middle of tests, we subject to its thorough control from the point of view of maximally loaded parts, and before, approaching the shooting, we control also the adjustable valve inside the gas chamber. The fact is that “Baikal” with its contented simple and rapid work, can be “disposed” to the most light 24 grams by action on the helical spring inside the threaded bushing. For decreasing the number of maintenance, it is important so that the valve would be correctly adjusted in order to facilitate the inflow of gas inside the cylinder and piston pressure, which sets in action twofold axis recharging.\r\n\r\nPour to us champagne.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the last day of tests, everything so early in the morning, not only in air, but also under the shed, the satisfaction was obvious - to the purpose by hand to give, whatever was eventual result. There was sensation, that from now on “Baikal” crossed critical limit. But meanwhile someone us still wanted to shoot, another, participating for the first time, wanted to leave its imprint in small or large enterprise. A little under the accretion of euphoria, almost we forget, which against the background entire other to us still remained to shoot out eight thousand cartridges “of [fiokka]”. But now this no longer seemed by this large matter. “After having a snack it fished” they approached the work, they reached “remainders from the box” for cleaning, tried “rough” to grease, injecting lubricant “Birchwood of casey” directly into the zone of the motion of components. MR-153, after reacting, snorted and sent the surplus of oil into the person of that shot. Better not to exaggerate, but to carry out cleaning as is fitting. More it was not long before noon of boxes on the stand, remained only cartridges scattering in the large plastic container. Three hours in the afternoon we approached the epilogue, exhausted, but contented as “[bambino]”, and they found time and desire in order to arrange special ceremony in the honor of cartridge number 50,000. The honor of this shot fell out on Giovanni. Immediately after this, they uncorked the bottle of champagne for all, who shot, and who with the interest looked on those, who were located on the field and shot with the frequency of machine gun. And there was, of course, toast for “Baikal”, which also worried and which was actually the main hero of these five days."\r\n*******************************\r\n\r\n[B]Videos of The Gruesome 50,000 Round Test:[/B]\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwL_JEsJ1b4[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFhK0ifNJ7g&feature=channel[/url]\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]', 1, 1, '115.186.174.161', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(159849, 4661, 0, 'Engineeer', 2044, 'Zero Your Scope with One Shot or No Shot Fired', 1290238435, 'Bench/Shooting Rest \r\n \r\nAnyone serious about testing the accuracy of rifles, and who doesn''t have nerves of steel, needs to use some sort of shooting rest. The same goes for anyone wanting to evaluate the accuracy of factory and hand loaded ammunition. Historically this was done with the ever popular coat-over-the-hood-of-your-pickup technique. Accuracy was hit or miss with this method, pun intended. Sandbags can be used, and they definitely improve accuracy, but it is a hassle to pack sandbags around. \r\nOne advantage of many of the shooting rests available today is reduction of felt recoil. The weight of the rest combines with the weight of the rifle, which helps to absorb the energy. The more the gun/rest weighs, the more felt recoil is reduced. It is simple physics. Bags of lead shot can be added to some rests, so even the hardest kicking calibers can be shot without getting a bruise on your shoulder. This also can prevent or mitigate flinching. The loud sound of a center fire rifle contributes to flinch, so always wear hearing protection when shooting to protect your ears.\r\nLike most shooting rests, the Bench is mostly for use at the range. However, the Bench is light and portable enough, at about 8 lbs that it could be taken into the field for varmint hunting. Simply set it up on a folding table or use the hood of a vehicle. Not ideal for that purpose, but a possibility that you might want to consider when comparing features.\r\nWith a weight of 8 lbs., the Bench does reduce felt recoil, but not as much as some of the heavier shooting rests. The Bench doesn''t have a tray to load for bags of lead shot but I have found that you can drape them over the front legs to help reduce recoil. In my experience the Bench, without additional weight, tames a .30-06 or a .270 so that you can comfortably shoot a couple boxes of cartridges and not be beat up by the experience. On Desert Mountain''s web site, one Bench Master user claims over 200 rounds of various .338 loads without pain or thought of recoil. I''m not sure I would go that far, but it does attenuate recoil.\r\nThe Bench does require some assembly, but it is as simple as threading some bolts with plastic knobs through the body of the device and the altitude adjustment mechanism. It couldn''t be much easier.\r\nAs seen in the illustration, the design of the Bench is in the shape of a T. There is an elevated part that comes up in the front that a bench bag fits into. This supports the forearm of the stock. On this is a level indicator. At the rear is a "Vee" shaped padded rest with a heavy-duty canvas strap across the back, which the butt of the rifle fits into. In the center is an adjustment knob that allows you to fine tune the elevation of the gun to align the sights with the target. At the end of each part of the T are adjustment feet that allow additional elevation and leveling adjustments. The entire rest hinges in the center for radical elevation adjustment. There are wing nuts on the feet and a knob on the side to lock everything into place.\r\nAfter you learn how the Bench needs to be adjusted for your gun, it is fairly easy to get set up. Going from one gun to another can take some time if the feet adjustments have to be tweaked, but usually the fine adjustment in the center accommodates differences in stock designs. The Bench works best on a flat level surface, but with the various adjustments, you can set it up in a less than perfect spot, such as the hood of a vehicle.\r\nFiring a rifle in the Bench is very natural. The butt of the rifle fits into the padded V rear rest and the stock rests on the front bench bag. The way the Bench is designed, no part of the rest gets in your way like some bulky rests do. Press the gun into the rear V rest and onto the bench bag and then tweak the adjustments until the sights line up on your target. There are no side to side adjustments, so you will have to move the rear foot around on the surface, which surprisingly enough works pretty well. Put your shoulder up firmly against the rear rest/butt of the rifle, and shot as you normally would. Even with very small calibers, the Bench will move a little from the recoil, so each time you may have to make some minor adjustments to realign the sights.\r\npictures of original rest and my local made rest are give below. i fires 7.62mm g3, 7mm, .243cal, 8mm, .22cal, and 6.5mm\r\n\r\ntighten the gun fire one shot now wd out moving gun even 1mm bring scope cross at that shot. ur done. else fix laser boresighter and wd out firing even 1 shot bring cross hair to dot ur done.', 1, 1, '119.153.139.211', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It appears drastically incorrect to me. And don''t worry about the barrel life, most handguns can easily shoot over 25000 rounds which most of us can not shoot in our life time. Viking has a very high quality barrel, I can assure you. Good enough to last for more than our average lifetimes. \n\n\n[QUOTE=harry;160032]Brothers,\nAs per my understanding sporting barrels (guns) are not made to last. Primary focus of making sporting guns/barrels is for precision target shooting only. They are not supposed to last long/fire thousands of rounds. \nThey are like Ferrari F1 engines.[/QUOTE]\nOn the contrary, sporting barrels are made to last a long time. Shooting 50000 rounds with a competition gun is nothing abnormal whereas very few combat guns would ever shoot that much in their life time.
