So after discussing with Denovo87 bro i went to Lahore to buy a Phantom but they were out of stock. So the next options were the Duty and CZ75 Omega and Cz 75 Combat. So when i held them all i instantly fell in love with Duty. It fit my hand like a glove, like it was tailored for me. The Balance of the gun and the point of aim tha way i hold it is so natural. The Omega trigger system is amazing. So i was anxious to take it home and Pop the Cherry. When i fired the gun for the first time it amazed me. The grip was great, the recoil was soft, and the trigger " WoW". Let me tell you that i fired around 30 + rounds and it surprised me in each shot. Your just pulling the trigger slowly and before u know it bang it fires. Im not sure what the trigger pull in SA  is but if the 809 is 5lbs then its definitely less then that. Of all the 100 + rounds that i fired from this beauty i had no dramas. No FTFeed/ Fire, no FTEs finally! Its just a great gun and very reliable.', ''),

I always recommend them because CLP/lubricants/gun cleaning solutions might have solvents in them that can enter into the blood stream through contact via skin. therefore it is always advised to used latex gloves whenever handling such chemicals. thing with latex gloves is that they are air tight and inside your hands sweat alot. therefore I tend to minimize the discomfort by only wearing them when i''m actually handling chemicals or chemical drenched work pieces. since the aerosol can directs the blast in a focused area therefore I was in no danger of contacting the chemicals therefore I chose not wear gloves for this part. I did however wear them when I scrubbed it with a tooth brush. And you are absolutely right, the best practice should have been that I wear gloves the whole time during this exercise.\n\nabout cleaning of the barrel. Abbas Bhai, that is probably the most easiest part in the initial cleaning of an over and under shotgun. all you need is a pull-through or a cleaning rod. some patches (no solvent necessary as it is a new shotgun) and just run it a couple of time through the bore and you are good to go.

I distinctly remember 8th  grade biology class, because I aced all but my first chapter exam and  shot the class average all to hell. It was around that time my older  sister decided to clean out her closet and donate a large box of ratty  notebooks and study guides from six years earlier when she was my age. I  distinctly remember my mother breaking up our dispute, as I screamed at  Shelley to remove her box of "junk" from my bedroom which had space for  guns, fishing gear and mounted deer heads -– NOTHING more!\n             [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5108.jpg[/IMG][/CENTER]\n             Whatever convinced me not to toss those old books is  beyond me. And, to my surprise, I recognized that my first biology exam  was a Xerox copy of a sample test from my sister''s old study guide. If I  had only of studied it, I would have aced that first test, too!  Nonetheless, I knew from that time forward, I would be setting the grade  curves for the rest of the class. When you''re in 8th grade, things like  that just don''t happen without a reason, and I chalked it up as one of  the bennies of having to deal with an older, teenage sister. \n            \n            If anything comes as easily as my 8th grade biology class,  I''d have to say ultrasonic cleaning is as close as it gets. Ultrasonic  cleaners make gun cleaning and lubrication super fast and easy for the  serious shooter, and profitable for the busy gun shop owner. It''s a  happy blend of engineering and chemistry that provides unsurpassed  cleaning for any small arms application. The process itself occurs when  sound waves are transmitted at super high frequencies, well beyond the  range of human hearing. Most systems are of basic design, housing no  more than a generator to produce the required electrical energy and a  transducer to convert and radiate it as "ultrasonic" sound waves. The  cleaning tank is constructed of stainless steel and serves as a holding  reservoir for today''s specially formulated cleaners. These solutions  help create the implosion of microscopic bubbles -– a process called  "cavitation" – which forms a powerful vacuum effect that literally pulls  debris particles from all the nooks and crannies of a firearm. The  overall process provides a superior, deep cleaning action rated up to 16  times more effective than manual methods of gun cleaning.\n            \n            As is typically the case when preparing to write articles of  this nature, I went on the prowl for a gun that would meet certain  requirements. First and foremost, it had to be small enough to fit our  in-house, 12"x6"x6" ultrasonic tank. Second, it had to be good and  dirty. And finally, it couldn''t be an irreplaceable gun in the event I  damaged or destroyed it. \n            \n            Without hesitation, Gun Technician Nate Bardole bravely  stepped up to the plate and handed over a polymer-framed Ruger 22/45.  Having little experience with ultrasonic cleaning, I was a bit concerned  about Nate''s grip frame. I didn''t want to find a warped and disfigured  ball of plastic in the bottom of the basket after the timer shut off, so  I turned to our sales representative, Peter Hula at L&R Ultrasonics  to answer a few of my questions. Peter advised that hard polymers are  generally safe in ultrasonic cleaners, and many law enforcement agencies  are even subjecting tritium night sights to ultrasonic waves without  any damaging effects. He did, however, discourage the cleaning of any  soft polymer or rubberized items, such as pistol grips, in an ultrasonic  system. Apparently, these materials can permanently swell out of  proportion. Besides wood stocks and grips, antique firearms are also off  limits if you intend to preserve the natural beauty of aged patina or  rust blued finishes. In any case, if you''re concerned about cleaning a  particular modern firearm in an ultrasonic cleaner, it''s a good idea to  consult with the maker before taking the chance of voiding any  warranties.\n            \n            The front sight on Nate''s Ruger was painted an obnoxious  blaze orange color that he didn''t especially care for, so he wasn''t  concerned about the paint lifting out. In addition, Nate had added a  piece of 3M, textured tape (the type designed to adhere to concrete) to  the front strap of the grip frame. He and I both figured the tape would  be a goner, but he urged me to go ahead and put the frame through a  complete ultrasonic cleaning process.\n            \n            Since fellow writer Andrew Swan was in the middle of  refurbishing an early model 24 S Series over/under for a buddy, I also  managed to scrounge up a couple extra parts from the old squirrel gun  for testing in our ultrasonic system. \n            \n            The beauty of ultrasonic cleaning for both novice and  armorer is that simple field stripping is usually all that''s required to  ensure a good, thorough cleaning. This means virtually anybody who can  understand the basic teardown procedure in the owner''s manual can  achieve a fast, professional cleaning without the added labor or expense  of complete disassembly/assembly of the weapon. I took down the 22/45  following the explicit teardown procedure in Ruger''s instruction manual  and discovered that 600 rounds of rimfire ammunition can create quite a  mess! The trigger, spring plunger, disconnector, bolt stop and most of  the internal surface of the polymer frame were caked with lead and  bullet lube that created a messy, wax-like coating that smeared around  when wiped with a cotton cleaning patch. From what I ''d heard, removing  this kind of crud from all the crevices of a handgun was what ultrasonic  cleaning was all about.\n            \n            Preparing a revolver for ultrasonic cleaning isn''t much more  difficult. Cock the hammer, remove the yoke and cylinder assembly from  the frame and separate them. If it''s a first time cleaning, it''s also  advisable to remove the side plates and place a spacer between the star  and cylinder to ensure everything gets good and clean.\n             [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5095.jpg[/IMG]\n            [I]Bullet lube and lead residue from rimfire ammo can  produce a greasy, wax-like coating that''s difficult to remove from the  internal crevices of a firearm, especially polymer-framed guns that get  quirky around solvents and degreasers. [/I][/CENTER]\n             The Ruger''s bolt assembly showed similar signs of fouling  along its sides, plus lots of brass buildup along the flat surface that  cocks the hammer and rides over the top cartridge in the magazine. To  top it off, the breech face and ejection port areas were coated with  burnt powder and carbon, both characteristic byproducts of shooting  semi-autos. They make special cutters for removing this kind of crud  from an AR-15, so you know it''s not the type of stuff you want to tackle  with solvent and a toothbrush.\n             [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5098.jpg[/IMG]\n            [I]When Nate BBQ''s, he likes his breech faces "well done."  This much carbon and burnt powder requires powerful cleaning. We''ll see  whether ultrasonic measures can handle it! [/I][/CENTER]\n             Andrew''s parts were also filthy – mostly coated with a  thick layer of dust and grime and some formation of rust on portions of  the hammer – especially the polished, sear engagement surfaces. This  would have been a quick project for today''s solvents and abrasive  cleaners coupled with a little elbow grease. But, I wanted to see how  the ultrasonic cleaner would handle all the loose debris and where it  would reside in the tank once cleaning was complete.\n                                                                                                     [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5088.jpg[/IMG]\n                        [I]Shown here is the forearm retaining bracket  for the Savage 24.

I gathered up the concentrated,  non-ammoniated cleaning solution and followed the mixing instructions of  1 part cleaner to 10 parts warm tap water, pouring them directly into  the stainless steel tank. The non-flammable cleaning solution was almost  odorless and a pleasure to work with. Because it contains no ammonia,  it''s safe for exterior finishes and longer dwell times. As instructed, I  filled the tank enough so that when the basket of parts was added, the  solution would raise to a level approximately 1 inch from the top of the  tank. When using fresh cleaning solution as I was, L&R recommends  running the unit five to ten minutes prior to adding the parts basket in  order to degas the solution. New cleaning solution contains a large  content of dissolved gasses that can reduce the efficiency of the  ultrasonic wave action until it burns off.\n                                                                                                     [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5105.jpg[/IMG]\n                        [I]One gallon of concentrated ultrasonic cleaner  goes a long way. Plus, you can reuse it several times before it starts  breaking down. [/I][/CENTER]\n                                                                                         I placed the lid on the tank, then preceded to plug-in  the line cord for the ultrasonic unit and set the automatic timer for 10  minutes to degas the system – nothing happened. Hmmm, I rechecked my  connection at the wall outlet and everything looked good. Was this a  switched outlet? Had the generator or transducer died? Nope, I had  actually plugged in the drill press instead of the ultrasonic cleaner by  mistake. Step 1 – be smarter than the ultrasonic cleaner. After finally  getting the correct power cord plugged into the outlet, I let the  solution degas.\n                                                                                                     [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5107.jpg[/IMG]\n                        [I]Small ultrasonic units like this are ideal  for cleaning one or two handguns. Cleaning can be less effective if the  size of the objects being cleaned is disproportionately smaller than the  tank. It''s also important not to overload the unit.[/I][/CENTER]\n                                                                                         In the meantime, I filled the parts basket and arranged  the grip frame so the magazine well and top opening would not be  obstructed. When the timer shut off, I submerged the parts basket, which  rested perfectly on the tank rim via its handles. According to L&R,  most firearms clean up nicely in 15 minutes or less, so I set the timer  for 12 minutes (which was the maximum shutoff time on our unit) and  took in the audible hum of ultrasonic waves dislodging the fouling from  the parts inside. Like a ravenous child waiting for a frozen pizza to  cook, I tipped up the lid and sneaked a few peaks now and again until 12  minutes had finally passed.\n            \n            As I removed the basket, I immediately noticed the cleaning  solution was much dirtier and the parts were much cleaner. However, the  worst areas like the breech face and inside the grip frame were still  pretty nasty looking. Much of the fouling was loosened up in these  spots, but they still needed some work. I was determined to get the  breech area completely clean, as too much powder buildup in this area on  a semi-auto almost always leads to extraction problems. I wasn''t  surprised that these areas were not sparkling clean yet. Nate had put a  heck of a lot of rounds through this pistol over the course of the  summer. Furthermore, rimfire ammo in a semi-auto is far dirtier to shoot  than, say, copper jacket projectiles out of a centerfire bolt gun.\n            \n            Andrew''s parts looked like new, so I removed them from the  basket, rinsed them in warm water and set them aside on a clean paper  towel to drip dry for a while. The dirt and rust were completely gone.  Because Andrew was nearly to the point of reassembling his project gun  and needed the parts back quickly, he decided to skip the ultrasonic  lubrication process and treat the parts with his favorite gun oil. I  returned the pistol parts to the ultrasonic cleaner and set the timer  for another 12 minutes.\n                                                                                                     [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5112.jpg[/IMG]\n                        [I]Pictured here are the Savage 24 parts after  12 minutes in the ultrasonic cleaner.

Quite honestly, I was impressed with the outcome. Every  last bit of powder and carbon residue on the troubled area of the  breech face had been dislodged. Since I had positioned the barrel on its  side in the parts basket for cleaning, these particles migrated from  the breech and formed a light sludge off to the side of the ejection  port. This stuff flushed right out of the barrel during the warm water  rinse.\n                                                                                                     [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5109.jpg[/IMG]\n                        [I]After 24 minutes of ultrasonic cleaning, every last bit of powder and carbon residue on the breech face had been dislodged.[/I][/CENTER]\n                                                                                         After I finished rinsing the rest of parts in warm water,  I began inspection. Inside the frame was 99% spotless. The only visible  fouling that remained was a small blemish about half the size of a  match tip on top of the trigger assembly and a few specks of dirt along  the top edge of the disconnector. A couple squirts of [URL="http://www.brownells.com/aspx/NS/store/ProductDetail.aspx?p=19723"]D''Solve™[/URL]  wiped those out in a heartbeat. Even the bolt and bore had a nice shine  to them. Next, I looked over the frame for any signs of melting, cracks  or deformation, but found nothing indicative of too much heat or an  adverse reaction to the cleaning solution or ultrasonic waves. And, to  my surprise, the 3M grip tape was still securely affixed to the front  strap with no sign of peeling.\n                                                                                                     [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5111.jpg[/IMG]\n                        [I]A look at the inside of the grip frame revealed only a miniscule amount of fouling left on top of the trigger and disconnector.

Failure to do  so can leave a tough, scum ring where the solution leveled out in the  tank. I found evidence of this as I prepared our in-house unit for  operation and believe me – even TCE had a tough time cutting it. I was  done cleaning and wanted to see exactly how much crud resided at the  bottom of the tank, so I pulled the plug and allowed it to drain. \n            \n            If you plan to reuse a batch of cleaning solution, I''d  recommend a fine mesh screen to trap the residual debris and help keep  the solution as pure as possible. I didn''t happen to have a filter handy  at the time and lost most of the fouling while draining off the  solution, but what I did see was enough to convince me that ultrasonic  cleaning does one heck of a job.\n                                                                                                     [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5123.jpg[/IMG]\n                        [I]Although much of the residual debris went out  the drain port, there''s enough here to convince most that ultrasonic  cleaning works![/I][/CENTER]\n                                                                                         One thing I noticed right off the bat when examining the  steel parts was that they were extremely clean, stripped of every last  trace of oil, as if they went through a high-pressure bath of degreaser.  For this reason, I can see the logic behind promptly going to step two  in the ultrasonic cleaning process – lubrication. Anything as deeply  cleaned as these parts, especially the unprotected bore and intricate  workings inside the frame need some thorough lubrication to recondition  and protect the surface metal from rust.\n            \n            The lubricating solution not only oils the parts but  provides a water-displacing bath similar to that used in a hot-salts  bluing operation. What''s nice is that the lubrication process is even  easier than cleaning because no mixing is involved. Simply pour the  premixed blend of solvents and water displacing oil straight into the  tank so all parts are covered, and turn on the ultrasonic cleaner for  same time it took to clean the weapon (generally 10 to 15 minutes). \n            \n            After rinsing and drying out the tank, I filled it up with  lubricating solution and loaded up the parts basket again. I wondered  whether the lubrication bath would make the polymer grip frame slippery  or loosen the 3M tape, so I threw that in, too. Then, I set the  automatic timer and waited again for 12 minutes to pass. When the parts  were done, I lifted out the basket and laid them on a paper towel to  absorb the excess oil. All parts looked very well lubricated, the grip  frame was not slick and the tape on the front strap was still intact. I  noticed after about 15 to 20 minutes that the lubricating solution was  starting to dry. \n            \n            Since I didn''t have time to allow the parts to fully air-dry  as recommended, I shook them off, and then finished drying them with a  clean cloth. I think this shortcut robbed me of the full protective  benefits of the lubrication/water displacement process, because Nate  noticed some fresh surface rust on the magazine spring after I returned  the pistol to him. Hence, always follow the manufacturer''s  recommendations! Because the lubricating solution dries to a protective  film, I would also advise additional treatment with your favorite  non-drying, high-viscosity, lubricating oil on all moving parts to  prevent wear.\n                                                                                                     [CENTER][IMG]http://www.brownells.com/UserDocs/Miscellaneous/wb904-5124.jpg[/IMG]\n                        [I]Field stripped parts fresh out of the lubrication bath.

Walther p22 is a very good choice for practice or for carry (I carry one often) as it too is good for small hands AND in both options the items are light enough to be carried in purse.', ''),

(331486, ' Some thoughts on Penetration, Bullet expansion and immediate disabling of adversary.\nUnless the bullet has a high velocity it is not likely to perform as advertised ie it may not expand as predicted. A .45 cal, 230 gr bullet has a vel of 830 feet per sec, a 9mm has a velocity from 1250 to over 1400 feet  with 115 and 124 gr bullets .\nA .357 can shoot bullets of 158 grain bullets from 1400 to around 1500 feet.\nA  hand gun bullet is known to kill effectively if it penetrates to at least 14 to 18 inches , all three calibers are  capable of doing it, withe the 357 leading in penetrating cars and their screens , a 9mm is a close 2nd with the 45 a bit behind in penetration through barriers.\nThe over penetration is over hyped we have brick walls and in public places the danger is from missing the target and hitting some  bystander a 9mm hollow point or a 357 soft or HP will rarely exit and even if it does it has spent all its energy in the needy target. Slow moving bullets sometimes penetrate more than high velocity expanding bullets.', ''),
(331487, ' @Arsalan Are there any questions or research you would like our help with ?\n\nPlease keep a couple of points in mind for your documentary:\n\n1). Almost [U][B]ALL[/B][/U] weapons used in crimes are Illegal and have absolutely nothing to do with us, legal gun users.\n\n2). Law abiding citizens have either to move heaven and hell to get a valid firearms license or pay hefty agent commissions to get the job done.\n\n3). A majority of gun owners in Pakistan (over 90 %) do not posses automatic weapons nor are interested in them even if given the opportunity. \n\n4). There are no firearm training institutes in Pakistan for teaching citizens how to handle, clean or shoot weapons so they can protect their homes and families. A lot of our friends at PakGuns came/come here for just this reason, we try to guide our visitors in safe gun handling and offer advise on which firearms best suit their protection/shooting needs.\n\n5). There are no serious bodies promoting this sport in Pakistan. All the existing ones are useless. We have great shooting talent here in Pakistan. It all goes to waste due to petty politics, lack of ranges, lack of funding etc.\n\n6). Bangladesh would be a good example to cite in comparison with Pakistan. They have over 100 shooting clubs there which all offer small competitions multiple times a year. Those wining competitions and spotted as having talent are given a stipend, free ammo and rifles and moved to a bigger club. This chain of promotions eventually acts as an excellent sorting pool of talent from all over their country. In our case we just have one range per major city in Pakistan and by major I mean Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. Operationally there are less than 10 ranges in the whole of the country.\n\n7). All counties give ammo subsidies to their shooters. I.e competitive shooting rounds are sold to shooter at 1/4 their cost. In Bangladesh an Eley .22 LR round costs Rs. 4 at the range whereas here it is sold for Rs. 15. Ranges also provide weapons to shooters to test, in our case we are lucky to have a friend whose weapon we can try.\n\n8). Government needs to encourage small industry to produce quality controlled local ammunition. The current Government organization PHSDC is all about free trips abroad with little to no practical results. \n\n9). Pakistan with very little investment on the part of the Government is capable of making the BEST HANDMADE shotguns in the world !\n\n10). The Government should have a separate list of shooters and gun owners in Pakistan. The new NADRA licenses for one are useful for gun owners but not useful or practical for shooters who change weapons often and own multiple weapons.\n\n11). The ammunition limit stamped on licenses is idiotic and foolish. A tradition left over from British times trying to limit the quantity of ammunition in the hands of the local populace. In a free democratic country limits like 100 rounds per year is insane. For shooters it is extraordinary frustrating, as any one into competitive shooting will tell you, when training an average of 100 rounds is fired PER day. \n\n12). Existing shooting ranges need to make memberships cheaper and easier to get. This is sport not a profit making enterprise. Ranges like Karsaz in Karachi and Gun Club in Islamabad charge upto 500,000 for a membership !! This means only the elite get to fire their weapons and 99.9 % of the populace is filtered out. That effectively kills out any talent looking to enter the sport.\n\n13). Ranges need to play a fatherly role and accept and cater to new clubs and teams I.e instead of the having just 8/9 since the 1950''s. Just from the talent available at PakGuns we can have enough players for 5 separate teams ! If given the chance, training facilities, the shooters on this forum can beat any team from Pakistan. \n\nI hope the above detailed post will help with your research. Also if you are interested I will speak to a couple of accomplished shooters and request them to make themselves available for an interview for your documentary.', ''),

(331518, ' A very good point that AK47 made is the high price of quality weapons here in Pakistan. Although it has more to do with arms producing countries having export bans on Pakistan rather than a flaw in our system it could be none the less made easier by the Government requesting the concerned bodies of the arms producing countries to make an exception in the case of sports / competition oriented weapons. \n\nPOF is quite like MKEK that AK is talking about but much less friendly towards commercial aspects geared towards the general public. It produces shotgun and 9mm ammo in it''s ''spare time'' for the local market which in the event of an increased demand from the military or foreign orders dries up. POF needs to expand it''s commercial facilities and provide subsidized ammo to all kinds of competitive shooters. They don''t need to hire marketing teams or setup stalls to find customers "WE ARE RIGHT HERE" and using foreign made ammo just because we can''t find any POF production in the market ! 9mm rounds for example shipped from Europe or Russia are sold here for Rs. 38 to 50 and much lower quality local POF is not available in the market even at Rs. 45. What is wrong with this picture ? Is our labor more expensive than Europe ? Are other manufacturing costs higher ? Is transportation cost higher from Wah to Karachi, Lahore or Islamabad than from Europe to these places ?  \n\nAs far as elaboration on Gun education, I have always held the belief that prior to issuing the first firearm license to a citizen the Government should require a firearms handling certificate as part of the requirements to obtaining an license. If this is difficult for the Government to do on it''s own then different companies should be appointed to teach, evaluate and issue certification on behalf on the Government. Everything which a gun owner ''needs to know'' can be taught in a three hour class. The first of which always begins with the mantra "Loaded or unloaded, never point your gun at anything which you don''t wish to destroy".\n\nI also believe that every household should have at least two firearms. A handgun and a shotgun. The handgun serves as a defensive weapon while outside the home and the shotgun is an excellent home defense weapon. Both can also be used for sporting purposes.\n\nAk made a very important point about serialization of guns, that along with quality control teams dedicated to genuinely helping our cottage firearms manufactures can go a long way in legalizing and controlling this industry in a few decades. In short make everything legal easy for people and they will stop doing illegal things. \n\nThe spirit of NCC (training during college etc) is true but it''s usefulness has declined to zero in the past few years. Like all education / books / curriculum it needs to be updated with time. Students should be taken to ranges as they already are and instead of it being a picnic and a hooha, a 3/4 hour class should be held teaching the students the following:\n\n1). Highlight the importance of Gun Safety and Taught Gun safety basics.\n2). An brief introduction to firearms. Types shotguns, rifles, handguns etc etc. Which kind is useful for what. Sports, hunting, self defense etc.\n3). How to hold and handle a gun.\n4). How to strip and clean a gun.\n5). Finally have them shoot 30 bullets on paper targets at distances of 10 M and 15M and 5 cartridges and bullets each from a shotgun and rifle respectively.\n\nThe entire cost of the class can be reimbursed from students by them having to pay Rs. 1000 each. The government if it wishes can charge private schools more and subsidize public school children with the extra amount. In our schools these days we have too much of theoretical learning and no technical education at all. This one class will make them educated gun owners and teach them something they will remember for the rest of their lives.', ''),

(331524, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;170857]@Arsalan Are there any questions or research you would like our help with ?\r\n\r\nPlease keep a couple of points in mind for your documentary:\r\n\r\n1). Almost [U][B]ALL[/B][/U] weapons used in crimes are Illegal and have absolutely nothing to do with us, legal gun users.\r\n\r\n2). Law abiding citizens have either to move heaven and hell to get a valid firearms license or pay hefty agent commissions to get the job done.\r\n\r\n3). A majority of gun owners in Pakistan (over 90 %) do not posses automatic weapons nor are interested in them even if given the opportunity. \r\n\r\n4). There are no firearm training institutes in Pakistan for teaching citizens how to handle, clean or shoot weapons so they can protect their homes and families. A lot of our friends at PakGuns came/come here for just this reason, we try to guide our visitors in safe gun handling and offer advise on which firearms best suit their protection/shooting needs.\r\n\r\n5). There are no serious bodies promoting this sport in Pakistan. All the existing ones are useless. We have great shooting talent here in Pakistan. It all goes to waste due to petty politics, lack of ranges, lack of funding etc.\r\n\r\n6). Bangladesh would be a good example to cite in comparison with Pakistan. They have over 100 shooting clubs there which all offer small competitions multiple times a year. Those wining competitions and spotted as having talent are given a stipend, free ammo and rifles and moved to a bigger club. This chain of promotions eventually acts as an excellent sorting pool of talent from all over their country. In our case we just have one range per major city in Pakistan and by major I mean Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. Operationally there are less than 10 ranges in the whole of the country.\r\n\r\n7). All counties give ammo subsidies to their shooters. I.e competitive shooting rounds are sold to shooter at 1/4 their cost. In Bangladesh an Eley .22 LR round costs Rs. 4 at the range whereas here it is sold for Rs. 15. Ranges also provide weapons to shooters to test, in our case we are lucky to have a friend whose weapon we can try.\r\n\r\n8). Government needs to encourage small industry to produce quality controlled local ammunition. The current Government organization PHSDC is all about free trips abroad with little to no practical results. \r\n\r\n9). Pakistan with very little investment on the part of the Government is capable of making the BEST HANDMADE shotguns in the world !\r\n\r\n10). The Government should have a separate list of shooters and gun owners in Pakistan. The new NADRA licenses for one are useful for gun owners but not useful or practical for shooters who change weapons often and own multiple weapons.\r\n\r\n11). The ammunition limit stamped on licenses is idiotic and foolish. A tradition left over from British times trying to limit the quantity of ammunition in the hands of the local populace. In a free democratic country limits like 100 rounds per year is insane. For shooters it is extraordinary frustrating, as any one into competitive shooting will tell you, when training an average of 100 rounds is fired PER day. \r\n\r\n12). Existing shooting ranges need to make memberships cheaper and easier to get. This is sport not a profit making enterprise. Ranges like Karsaz in Karachi and Gun Club in Islamabad charge upto 500,000 for a membership !! This means only the elite get to fire their weapons and 99.9 % of the populace is filtered out. That effectively kills out any talent looking to enter the sport.\r\n\r\n13). Ranges need to play a fatherly role and accept and cater to new clubs and teams I.e instead of the having just 8/9 since the 1950''s. Just from the talent available at PakGuns we can have enough players for 5 separate teams ! If given the chance, training facilities, the shooters on this forum can beat any team from Pakistan. \r\n\r\nI hope the above detailed post will help with your research. Also if you are interested I will speak to a couple of accomplished shooters and request them to make themselves available for an interview for your documentary.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nVery valid and impressive points. These points should be the main theme of Documentary', ''),

(331530, ' [B]@Chief.[/B]...Excellent draw up, bro. Perfect.\n \nEspecially liked the licensing process suggested. Licenses should be issued only to people who take the preliminary classes and pass the basic tests in safe handling of the guns, just like with computerized driver''s licenses. Excellent.\n \n[B]@ED..[/B]......You''d be a very good candidate bro, seriously, to speak our minds from such a platform?? \n \nI''m sure you could convey our agenda/appeal/points most convincingly. Kindly consider. Regards.\n \n[B]PS.[/B]......Chief, you''re right about the functioning comparison between POF and Turkish MKEK, as quality assurance bodies, yet the major difference between these two is, that whilst POF only supervises production of POF products and consequently conducts quality checks on their [B]own[/B] products only, MKEK in Turkey is open for quality inspection/trade endorsing/[I]serialization[/I] of products from private companies and manufacturers within Turkey, like Sarsilmaz, Tisas, Stoeger, etc.\n \nNo item is allowed for sales/export in Turkey without the involvement and [I]serialization process[/I] of the goods by MKEK. This is visible by looking at the frame of most/[I]all[/I] Turkish handguns available in our markets, the serial numbers of which usually begin with a Turkey "[I]TR[/I]" imprinted, before the rest of the numerical digits. \n \nFinally, may I say, that by following the suggestions I mentioned in earlier post about [I][B]engaging[/B][/I] the tribal belt manufacturers and skilled, expertised working force -[I] in setting up government controlled small-arms manufacturing units with all "high tech" equipment/machinery and consequent quality assurance involvement of the POF or any other government body on the lines of MKEK, Turkey[/I] - the [I]culture[/I] of ordering "special made" items - [I][B]which most frequently end up in the wrong and illegally owning criminal hands[/B][/I] - may eventually fade out with the passage of time, since the output coming from such high-tech, modernized CNC manufacturing processes and legally organised manufacture set-up, will surpass the quality of - and [I]confidence[/I] in - manually and illegally manufactured, low quality products, manifold. \n \nPeople would be focused upon the items being manufactured from such units, just like we''re always on the look-out for items coming from Daudsons, etc, i.e the never appearing 9mm handgun, and the few illegally manufacturing units -which would remain [I]temporarily[/I] - may "die out" a natural "death", [I]gradually[/I].\n \nThis eventually could rid us of illegal arms. Course, there''ll be [I]loopholes[/I] as always, yet the situation of flow of illegal and unchecked weapons could get considerably improved. Even foreign investors could get attracted and interested in setting up units of renowned brands, just like in Turkey, yielding us, ultimately, a national economic benefit as well.\n \nTime for some innovative thinking!\n \nRegards.\n \n \n[B]@Mods[/B]......Kindly delete the "angry man" smiley from the top of my post, wonder where the heck it came from, lolz!', ''),

(331624, 'Eye Dominance Found a very interesting test online. Thanks to archers out there :)\r\nThe source can be found at the end of the test.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.archeryweb.com/archery/images/eyedom.gif[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe following method is one of the easiest ways to checking eye dominance for both adults and even very young children:\r\n\r\n	• Extend both hands forward of your body and place the hands together making a small triangle (approximately 1/2 to 3/4 inch per side) between your thumbs and the first knuckle.\r\n	• With both eyes open, look through the triangle and center something such as a doorknob or the bullseye of a target in the triangle.\r\n	• Close your left eye. If the object remains in view, you are right eye dominant. If your hands appear to move off the object and move to the left, then you are left eye dominant.\r\n	• To validate the first test, look through the triangle and center the object again with both eyes open.\r\n	• Close your right eye. If the object remains in view, you are left eye dominant. If your hands appear to move off the object and move to the right, then you are right eye dominant.\r\nOne more alternative method is to assume the same position with your hands forming the triangle around the object and have both eyes open. Now, slowly bring your hands toward your face while continuing to look at the object with both eyes open. When your hands touch your face, the triangle opening should be in front of your dominant eye.\r\n\r\nPasted from <http://www.archeryweb.com/archery/eyedom.htm>', ''),

Thanks to archers out there :)\r\nThe source can be found at the end of the test.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.archeryweb.com/archery/images/eyedom.gif[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe following method is one of the easiest ways to checking eye dominance for both adults and even very young children:\r\n\r\n	• Extend both hands forward of your body and place the hands together making a small triangle (approximately 1/2 to 3/4 inch per side) between your thumbs and the first knuckle.\r\n	• With both eyes open, look through the triangle and center something such as a doorknob or the bullseye of a target in the triangle.\r\n	• Close your left eye. If the object remains in view, you are right eye dominant. If your hands appear to move off the object and move to the left, then you are left eye dominant.\r\n	• To validate the first test, look through the triangle and center the object again with both eyes open.\r\n	• Close your right eye. If the object remains in view, you are left eye dominant. If your hands appear to move off the object and move to the right, then you are right eye dominant.\r\nOne more alternative method is to assume the same position with your hands forming the triangle around the object and have both eyes open. Now, slowly bring your hands toward your face while continuing to look at the object with both eyes open. When your hands touch your face, the triangle opening should be in front of your dominant eye.\r\n\r\nPasted from <http://www.archeryweb.com/archery/eyedom.htm>[/QUOTE]', 'Eye Dominance'),

(337126, ' [QUOTE=Conceal Carry;47155]Bore (whether in inches or milimeters) only refers to the dia of the projectile. More comprehensive and accurate term is caliber which includes the length of the projectile also. The length of the projectile must conform to the length of the chamber. For example 9mm comes in four lengths, i.e. 9X19, 9X21, 9X23, and 9x25. Out of these 9x19 generally known as 9mm or 9mm para or 9mm lugar is the most common others are somewhat obsolete or not very common at least in Pakistan.\n\nSo if you had a gun chambered for 9x21, you''ll never ask for the 9mm round you''ll be specific and ask for 9mm Largo round or 9X21 round.\n\nTo tell the difference,\n9mm = dia of the bullet\n9X19 = Caliber of the bullet\n\nI hope this will clear the concept.[/QUOTE]\n\nQuite correct, old chap. The metric military designator indicates the diameter of the projectile first, then indicates the length of the cartridge case. 9X19 indicates that the diameter of the projectile is 9mm, and the case is 19mm long(called the 9mm Parabellum in Europe). The Soviets used the 9X18mm (Makarov) and care needs to be taken not to mix the two. The Makarov round will chamber and fire in the 9mm Luger (Parabellum), but the case will not extract. Likewise will the 7.62X51 (.308) chamber and fire in a weapon designed for the 7.62X54R, but the case will have to be extracted by a gunsmith.\nThere are a few exceptions, for instance the Swiss 7.5X55 round has a diameter of 7.62mm, not 7.5mm.\n\nOlder cartridges were designated by the diameter and the black powder charge. Even though modern smokeless powder is now used in many cartridges that were originally charged with black powder. An example would be the 45-70 Gov. round, a .45 caliber bullet with a (originally) 70 grain charge of black powder. This is sometimes confusing because there was no real standard by which cartridges were named. The 30-06 was named that because it was a .30 caliber (roughly) bullet that became the standard military rifle cartridge in America in 1906.', ''),

First let me reiterate, however, that I do believe in both awesome/magnificent calibers.\n\nNow onto the maths. First of all, excellent and nice work by 12G bro above. Also, I agree with ACHILLES bro, that our part of the world does not hold the best physiques and human built, hence smaller can work good enough, nor are BG''s of our part of the world as "toughened" [I]nuts[/I] like those in the western world, most of our BG''s barely know the [I]abc''s[/I] of the very things they hold in their hands for the assault.\n\nYet, let me say, for a healthier discussion here on an internationally most debated issue, that maths alone cannot hold true between two such close contenders. Whilst the wound channels are correctly calculated above, with respect to cross-sectional area of outgoing bullet and consequent bleeding out, another important factor called [I]shock-wave[/I] or[I] hydrostatic shock[/I], whatsoever, seems ignored! Not being a science graduate, I still believe delivery impact/ momentum of force is calculated by the F= MV formula or something of the like, basically [I]mass X velocity[/I]. Hence, even if we take the lower muzzle-velocity figures of both calibers, i.e 850ft/second of the 230 grainer cal .45 and 1200ft/second of the 115 grainer 9mm round, the cal .45 round travelling with [B]2X mass [/B]([B]200%[/B]) vs the 9mm, with a velocity lag of only [B]70%[/B]( 850/1200), the gross product still is in favor of the cal.45!!\n\nSecond, you cannot fairly outdo the cal .45''s lower hit rate solely due to the handguns lower mag capacity (8-10 rounds), there even are double stacked out there, and moreover, in addition to [I]traditional maths[/I], you''ll have to involve [I]probability maths[/I] as well, and momentary factors of luck as well, coz who says which of the cal .45''s rounds will hit or which miss, similarly with the 9mm 15 rounder mag!! Hence, I do not quite think we can favor/disfavor anything from the pure mathematics involved.\n\nFinally, even if we do involve above maths alone to declare a winner, my calculations speak from another perspective, suppose you''re carrying a double stacked Norinco, 14 shots:\n\n[B]9mm total [I]momentum[/I][/B]:\n\nHit rate [B]18%[/B] (2.7 bullets) each of 115 grains, Muzzle velocity [B]1200ft/sec[/B], F=MV, hence following calculation:\n\n                            2.7X115X1200= [B]372600[/B] (Gross product).\n\n\n[B]Cal .45 total momentum[/B]:\n\nHit rate [B]18%[/B] (2.52 bullets) each [B]230 grains[/B], muzzle velocity [B]850 ft/sec[/B], F= MV, hence following calculation:\n\n                            2.52X230X850 = [B]492660[/B] (Gross energy product)\n\nThe winner this time around seems to be the cal.45, lolz!\n\nThis is an example why I meant to say that we can''t rely on the pure mathematics only, when comparing these two calibers, handicapping the usual 8 shots cal.45''s hit rate, solely due to the lower capacity.\n\nPutting in a .44 magnum six shooter would make the 9mm an even bigger winner, lolz!\n\nFinally on the hit ratio, I already stated above, that one should be capable of using one''s carried weapon efficiently/timely/responsively and with full confidence in order to carry the guns, otherwise better be without! We must [I]befriend[/I] our weapons as much as we possibly can, play around with them unloaded, oil them, take care of them, use them, dry-fire them, [I]love them[/I], so that there''s absolutely no kind of "[I]alienation[/I]" around, between your gun and yourself, when -God forbid it - the moment of emergency requires the use of it. Putting a gun away in the box and closet, just for the sake of a collection, will not give you the full efficient confidence in situations of use. Did anyone ever see Diego Maradona playing around with his ball, [I]off the ground[/I], when he was active?? That''s called [I]ball control[/I]. Similarily, you''d need that kind of a relationship between your gun and yourself!\n\nIf this is followed, and some routine shooting now and then with the cal.45 is done, who says the "hit ratio" cannot be improved. Finally, may I add, traditional SD range is said to be around 7-20 feet. Even from 20 ft''s distance, your 3 feet long arm and another 7-9 inches of your gun will decrease the distance to something like 15-16 feet, which is literally the size of an ordinary bedroom. Can  some of the even lesser practiced here, imagine pointing their .45 from one end of the bedroom to the other, and not being able to place more than 1.44 bullets out of 8 rounder mag? Let me know, lolz!\n\nFinally, thanks to 12G bro and all brothers active here, really enjoy such discussions with our experts. Let me repeat again, I''m a [I]dual carrier[/I], lolz!\n\n[B]@Dr. Zakir Sb[/B].......Sir, let me know of your mind now, lolz!', ''),

Actual formula to be applied for such ballistics is, I believe,:\n\n[I][B]Bullet Weight x Velocity^2 / 450,437.[/B][/I]=Foot-pounds\n\nSkeeter or HJ bro may know better, yet in any case, you''re right, the 9mm will emerge winner again, basically due to higher capacity once more, so we could conclude, that whilst the .45 cal is better in the hands of an experienced shooter, the 9mm can go with the general lot.\n\nMay I add, I''d still maintain that hit probabilities above are from statistical facts, and where maths and mathematical formula''s are constant and [I]invariable[/I] factors, statistics is indeed a very [I]variable[/I] factor, which should not be incorporated here. Statistical facts say there''s a rape every so and so many seconds, a murder every so an so many minutes and so on, where you can happen to be living somewhere where no such incidents may have occurred since years! Hence, if the statistical facts say 18% hit probability or 40 or whatsoever, it''s a generalized figure that needs not be constant at all.\n\n In any case, FBI is lucky not to have a [I]Hoover[/I] around any longer with such performance, no wonder why the Miami shoot-out ended the way it did! Correct me, if I''m wrong, didn''t that incident include failure of 9mm handguns, until the .357 landed a few good shots right in the face of the driver absconding from there??\n\nOverall, I repeat, both are very ideal SD calibers, and you''re right, short distances do turn me on, ha ha ha!\n\nRegards.', ''),

[B]unless you get 1000-1500 rounds of .45ACP under your belt, a 9mm is a more efficient man-stopper for you.[/B] as per your own statement/claim, your .45ACP advocacy campaign should immediately halt and wait till after you get 1-1.5K rounds under your belt. ;)\r\n\r\nThe whole idea that we have been trying to make you understand that a .45ACP is and always will be a better man-stopper if you can make your rounds count but if you skill is anything less than excellent/superb/awesome then you should stick to 9mm where you have higher probability of hitting an assailant (or critical organs) due to higher magazine capacity coupled with increased [B]relative[/B] expansion (.63inch of 9mm in just 115 grains vs .71inch of .45ACP in 230 grains) of 9mm hollow points. [B]making 9mm a more efficient man-stopper.[/B]\r\n\r\nwhen I say [B]increased relative[/B], you must fully understand this term as well. relative means, relative to its size. think like this please, a 230 grains bullet gives you 0.71inch of expansion whereas a bullet of 9mm which is almost half the weight gives you 0.63inch of expansion. a decline in expansion of just 11.26% against weight saving of whopping 50%. [B]9mm emerges as clear winner[/B]\r\n\r\nanother way of looking at it:\r\n\r\nmoving up from 9mm bullet to .45ACP would give you only 12.7 percent increased expansion whereas it would cost you a drastic increase in weight of 100 percent. again here, the figures reveal that the juice is not worth the squeeze or the benefits that you are getting in moving up from 9mm to 45ACP are not worth pursuing. [B]9mm emerges as clear winner again[/B].\r\n\r\nanother point of view:\r\n\r\nmoving up from 9mm to 45ACP would only give you additional energy of 0.34% (taking the velocity of both calibers quoted by you in all my calculations) whereas you mag capacity (hence hit probability) would decrease by 50%. not all a wise choice in my humble opinion.\r\n\r\nanother point of view: FBI wound volume statistics\r\n\r\nhere a 9mm bullet that enters typical human flesh generate..............I think I should leave this one alone as the calculations would serve to confuse a reader more. 9mm wins by a huge margin again so its pointless to pursue this excercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

[B]So far, this thread has been a comparison between "8 Rounds of .45 and 16 rounds of 9mm"[/B]. For an objective comparison, we need to set some ground assumptions to level the play ground. \r\nSince this is the caliber / ammunition debate, lets assume that there is no weapon. In fact, lets assume we have the same weapon with the same mag capacity to level the playing field. \r\nNow, lets restart! what say you all?\r\nI ll carry the 9mm on most days. why? "Awien" :P \r\nThese are the pluses for 9mm for daily carry.\r\n\r\n1. 9mm is less noisier than the 45. I might manage to still retain my senses after discharging a 9mm in closed space.\r\n2. 9mm has more penetration. Most of the times when we ppl carry, we are travelling and in vehicles etc and I trust a 9mm FMJ more than a 45 FMJ when wind shields  and window panes are involved.\r\n3. one round of 9mm weighs less than one round of .45ACP\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this does not mean that 9mm is the absolute round or a better man stopper and blah blah and math and more blah!

Last night I fully stripped my gun even firing pin! washed everything with the cleaning formula of Sir 12GUAGE. The result was amazing.. Lubricated the firing ping with POF gun oil. Then I lubricated the parts with some transparent silicone grease (bought by my father some years back).

I thought you were off the view that its too a powerful round and does not depend of "number of rounds fired" to be effective in the first place.\n\n\n\n\nright beside a CZ 999 Scorpion. :) did I mention a CZ 999 Scorpion with 20 rounds magazine? ooo la la.\n\n\n\nlosers whine about the competition, winner go home with the prom queen. luck has nothing to do with it my friend.\n\n\n\nkindly read my previous post again and more [B]clearly[/B] this time as I have quiet [B]clearly[/B] mentioned [B]a special CZ 999 Scorpion with 20 round magazines[/B]. and NO! CZ 999 is not from Moscow and neither is Baikal.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n \nMay I kindly remind you:\n\n[I][B]The discussion and challenge here is not about higher capacity guns vs lower capacity[/B][/I]!!\n\n[I]The discussion here is purely about the [B]magnitude of devastation[/B] inflicted upon a hit target, between the two calibers, .45 vs 9mm, since the very issue of your thread is about the two calibers and the preferences of carrying them, and not about the two different kinds of guns or capacities.[/I]\n\nIt''s purely and purely about cal .45 vs 9mm rounds, now who says one would need all 15 rounds to neutralize a threat with the 9mm???? Or even all 8 rounds of a cal.45??? \n\nYou wanna neutralize a treat or you gonna stand there and check the quantity of bleeding pouring out of [I]more holes[/I] with the 9mm round, or lower quantity of the same with the .45?\n\nThe test and challenge, my friend, is about the energy and momentum transferred onto a hit target with both the two calibers and the quicker neutralization. Max rounds capacity may not be required at all, but there''s a likeliness that fewer rounds of the cal.45 will neutralize the object hit quicker than more rounds with the 9mm, where the 9mm will have the benefit of more holes perhaps, the .45 the benefit of more "pound" delivered, which by itself will be [I]hyper-traumatic[/I]. You may have heard about a famous manner of speaking:\n\n                           "[I]Tarkan ki tak tak, Loahar ki eikh sath[/I]"\n\nIn actual and real life situations it''s not about  pumping more rounds into an object, but to deliver the required. With a couple of hits in the main torso area with the .45, job may usually be well done. Nobody would stand there and check the quantity of more blood coming out from the greater number of "tak,tak''s" and holes with the 9mm rounds!\n\nThe coconuts were picked to prove to you the devastating effects of the cal.45. Let''s see how many rounds of each calibers will prove better onto the target. One may never need more than first 2-4 rds, we''re talking[I] civilian SD[/I], not [I]military operations[/I], or last [I]back-up[/I] options, where the higher capacity would certainly be preferred.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Thanks bro for all the kindness and also to Syed Adeel for a great cup of tea on the way back, after a long session of great firing by Moeen bro, Dr. Zakir Sb and 12G bro.\n\nMy "[I]challenger[/I]", 12G bro showed up timely as per given notice, accompanied by Dr. Zakir Sb and Moeen bro, and we set out for the long awaited venture and experiment.\n\nFirst of all, the promised "Halwa", lolz!\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting010Small-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nHope you enjoyed it, but now on to the facts:\n\nThis "[I]Halwa[/I]" guyz was neither "[I]cooked[/I]" by the penetration of a 9mm Fmj or cal.45 FMJ, but by the [B]Jhp[/B] in [B]9mm[/B]. Excellent!\n\n[I]Regret-ably, there were no cal.45 Jhp''s with us for comparison.\n[/I]\nAs for 9mm Fmj''s, or cal. 45 Fmj''s, the 2 rounds of each simply "pierced" through!! I am, however, of the belief that one of the reasons why 4 shots with these shells didn''t break down the coconuts - [I]apart from the super high velocity course[/I] - that the coconuts had not been [I]peeled off[/I] of the outer "hairy" substance, which indeed holds the nut tightly bound.\n\nAnyhow, 12G bro will soon be back and post the remaining of the review with examples of penetrations, yet let me first of all declare some facts for you, regarding the two calibers, also trying to declare, [I]if possible[/I], a winner within some respective qualities:\n\n[B]1)[/B] [B]The 9mm is a[I] magnificent[/I] round, pretty much underestimated, wrongly. It''s one heck of power, no doubts, do never feel yourself carrying anything [I]impotent [/I]with this[/B]. \n\n[B]2)[/B] [B]The cal. 45 is[I] sheer power[/I] and impact[/B]. [B]  I was of the impression that whilst no other round, like the 9mm and .22 moved the wooden box considerably much when fired at - [I]during the penetration test [/I]- indeed the 230 grainer cal.45 slightly [I]rocked[/I] the box whilst piercing through all 6 layers.[/B] [B]The 9mm pierced through all 6 layers too, yet like a "needle", not moving the box at all, yet creating an exiting hole almost the size of the .45, whilst the cal .22 stopped short of layer 4, piercing 3. \n[/B]\n\n[B]3)[/B] [B]In terms of recoil, control and accuracy, 9mm is a winner.\n\n[/B]\n[B]4)[/B] [B]In terms of availability and economy, 9mm is a winner.\n[/B]\n\n[B]5)[/B] [B]In terms of capacity, 9mm is a winner again[/B].\n\n\n[B]6) In terms of[I] brute force[/I], the cal.45 is a winner -  with respect to the impact and energy delivered[/B].\n\n\nHence, most of the different aspects do go in the favor of the 9mm, which we must admit is here to stay and a magnificent SD carrying option. The situation in the USA is a bit different, as two of the aspects above, regarding availability and economy with respect to the cal .45 are ineffective against it.\n\nBoth calibers are excellent SD carry options, the cal.45 for a pretty fast knock down, the 9mm for the balanced power/recoil, versatility, capacity, variety and economy.\n\nMay I add, that another great winner of today was the excellent ammunition of the 9mm hollow point round by [B]Armscor.\n[/B]\nThe exiting holes of the armscor JHP''s were similar in size to the cal.45 FMJ!! Hence, for those who wish to carry 9mm and want kind of "mimic" of the cal.45 power, carrying the 9mm Jhp will keep you powerfully loaded. I''d suggest you the Armscor, since we tried the Prvi Partizan and Magtech as well, but they were both of no match at all to the Armscor ones.\n\n[I]Similarly, for those wishing to carry the cal.45, there''s literally no need to look around for expensive, hard to avail cal.45 [B]Jhp''s[/B]. The [B]Fmj[/B] in this caliber is powerful enough, working like a 9mm Jhp[/I].\n\nFinally, may I add, the absolute winner of today was none else than our magnificent fellow bro, Moeen! Apart from great company, he''s one heck of a shot, no darn BG should ever try coming across of! Shooting to him, involves no darn "concentration", breath control, stance, whatsoever, he''s done with pretty fast hits before any camera can manage to record! Best of all, he doesn''t even need a chart, his best target is always in his pocket, his very own [I]cigarettes box[/I], that he can place tight groupings on most impressively. Below is a [I]souvenir[/I] from him, shot from some 25 feet or so, enjoy!\n  \n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting011Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAnd some more pics.\n\n[B]The penetration test boxes prepared by 12G bro[/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting006Small-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]The Coconuts[/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting004Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]PT 1911, Para Ordnance, 9mm[/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting008Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]And an [I]appetizer[/I][/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting012Small-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nRemaining review to be presented by 12G bro, soon.

(332398, ' [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nfirst of all, allow me to thank Arslan_tareen Sb. (and company) and Adeel Sb. for their awesome generosity in making this test a wonderful and memorable event. the food, venue and location chosen and provided by Arslan_tareen Sb. was awesome and the view was simply breath taking. Gentlemen! i''m truly grateful to be so graciously hosted by you and to enjoy your wonderful company under a bright sunny day in the winters right next to an indescribably beautiful and scenic view.\r\n\r\n[B]First a simple mathematical assumption:[/B]\r\n\r\nA typical 45ACP projectile weighs 230 grains whereas a 9mm projectile weighs 115 grains. inorder to give them equal weightage, two 9mm rounds were used against one 45ACP round. and wherever it was necessary to fire more than one round, a similar ratio was used to ensure fairness.\r\n\r\n[I][B]Mathematical approximation:[/B][/I]\r\n\r\nTotal Energy of two 9mm rounds is 367.63*2=735.26 ft-lbs whereas total energy of 45ACP round is 368.9 f-lbs. [B]9mm wins.[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]Coconut Test:[/B]\r\n\r\nBoth coconuts were fired upon with both calibers and as i''ve said earlier, this test was expected not give us any results. i''ve already mentioned in the previous post that both rounds would simply wizz through as we were only using FMJs and they act like needles. however when we fired a 9mm HP (Armscor), the coconut simply blew open from one side. the picture of the coconut posted above is the result of HP fire. SG round fired from a shotgun however simply made a total halwa out of the coconuts and leaving no remains behind.\r\n\r\n[B]MDF Board test:[/B]\r\n\r\nSix sheets were horizontally piled (3 inches apart). the objective of this test was not to determine the penetrating ability of the rounds but to resist their motion just enough for them to expand. they were, I''ll repeat, were not designed to capture the bullet in flight. this test''s objective was to retard their motion just enough for expansion to occur.\r\n\r\nThe pictures clearly speak of the result. 45ACP FMJ makes entry and exit holes bigger than a 9mm round FMJ but the difference in diameters of holes between two calibers is only slight. \r\n\r\nhowever when we pitted a 45ACP JHP against 9mm hollow points, 9mm HPs made holes that are equal to 45ACP JHP. This result should be enough to convince a person (who firmly believes that 45ACP is a better manstopper) that why use a bigger round if you can get similar results from a smaller and better engineered round.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/9mm%20vs%2045ACP/DSC00483.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/9mm%20vs%2045ACP/Dsc00484.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/9mm%20vs%2045ACP/Dsc00485.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/9mm%20vs%2045ACP/Dsc00486.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe same result can also be successfully achieved through the following mathematical approximation:\r\n\r\n[I][B]Projectile Diameter:[/B][/I]\r\n\r\n9mm is around .354 inches whereas a 45ACP''s projectile diameter is .45inch.  27.12% larger. in other words, the a 45ACP''s projectile hole diameter should be 27.12% bigger. again, kindly allow me to remind that for all tests two 9mm rounds were considered against a 45ACP round so, total hole diameter of two 9mm rounds is .708 inches which is exactly 57.33% larger than 45ACP round. [B]9mm wins.[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]Water Bottle Test:[/B]\r\n\r\nTwo 5-litre water bottles (square base) were fired upon with both calibers. two rounds of 45ACP vs 4 rounds of 9mm. the 45ACP did some considerable damage to the bottle but 9mm rocking the bottle''s world upside down, practically shattered it to pieces. one reason would be combined energy dump of 4 rounds of 9mm. second reason would probably be that 9mm rounds were spread evenly on the bottles surface. effectively multiplying the damage.\r\n\r\nThe results here are of particular importance. they not only show that when number of rounds increase, the probability of hitting vital organs also increase but also show that combined energy is far more devastating as it exponentiates the damaging power of a round. [B]9mm wins[/B]\r\n\r\n[I]now after these drawing results from the tests, some observations were also noted:[/I]\r\n\r\n[B]Recoil:[/B]\r\n\r\n45ACP recoils alot whereas 9mm''s recoil is significantly low. [B]9mm wins.[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]Controlled firing:[/B]\r\n\r\nit is alot easier to control-fire a 9mm round than a 45ACP round. due to this fact/experience, it was considerably easier to fire multiple rounds in rapid succession of 9mm when compared to 45ACP. [B]9mm wins.[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]Bang:[/B]\r\n\r\n45ACP make one hell of a loud bang. potentially disorienting the user in close quarters. whereas a 9mm, though not a silent round by any measure, bangs alot less. [B]9mm wins.[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]Expansion:[/B]\r\n\r\nModern 9mm hollow points make almost the same sized bullet holes than a 45ACP FMJ. for JHPs in both calibers, the values have been averaged at .63inch for 9mm whereas .71inch for 45ACP. whereas the difference in weight (in grains) of projectiles is significant. I would humbly say. [B]9mm wins.[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\r\n\r\nnow lets combine the test results with observations and conclude this cookie. whenever a single 45ACP round is compared with a single 9mm round, .45ACP would always win hands down. there is no doubt about it. infact there never was. however a fair comparison necessitates a level playing field for both players. where a 45ACP gives you a deadly uppercut, a 9mm hits you with a jab followed by a cross. what we saw on a bright sunny Sunday is that a combo (jab+cross) inflicts far more damage than a single strike (uppercut).\r\n\r\nin other words, a 9mm is a more potent round when you consider the ability to fire more rounds at your intended target due to less recoil, more controllability, higher magazine capacity, only slightly less expansion, only slightly less projectile holes (entry and exit) and negligible difference in kinetic energies of both rounds.\r\n\r\nso... I''ve said it before and I''ll say it again: 9mm might not be a better man-stopper than a 45ACP but it is definitely a more efficient man-stopper than a 45ACP. it draws its efficiency by an overly simplified fact that it competes against a heavyweight (230 grains) while only being a middleweight (115 grains) and competes well.\r\n\r\n[B][I]while writing this review, the following comes to mind:[/I][/B]\r\n\r\nA 45ACP round is better suited to a fellow who through his skill or confidence does not need higher magazine capacity to end an assault. whereas a user who depends on higher probability of hitting vital organs coupled with higher combined damage caused by multiple rounds hitting the target would be better served with a 9mm round.\r\n\r\nwith a 45ACP, you hit few but you hit hard whereas with a 9mm you hit with a little less energy but the hits just keep on coming. ;)\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]\r\n\r\np.s. I would also include some additional observations this evening such as the devastating power of slug against concrete, the hole that a slug makes and awesome ability of Moeen Bhai in hitting targets with handguns that were more than 700 yards away.', ''),

This fact alone makes the 9m winner and leaves no space for additional tests.\r\n\r\n45 acp can only prove more effective in hands of an expert marksman who can hit all eight rounds in the target. However, in real life situation thats quite un likely to happen. Even the most expert of shooter can loose accuracy when in real life, life or death situation.\r\n\r\nwhat should be the first instinct of an intelligent person when faced by armed BG ? Should a person focus more on being still and aiming OR he should first of all find some cover ? \r\n\r\nI say finding cover should be the first instinct. Shooting while finding cover wont let u aim and shoot so having more rounds at your disposal might save ur life because it will increase the probability of hit.\r\n\r\nA BG hit at the right spot with a 9mm would die as quick as he would die with a 45 acp. and if not hit at the right spot he would survive just as long.', ''),

(380913, ' @Snowleopard, yes your contention is right, and I have already spoken about it at another thread in its favor, because it is very much logical.\r\n\r\n@Hunter1, bro TIMING that you mentioned is indeed correct. A specie that was NOT banned two years ago (like surkhab, barheaded goose etc) here in Punjab and pics posted about those in that period are entirely within the legal ambit and no cause for worries for anybody, at forum or outside. Besides, personally speaking, I don''t take these things very seriously --- I consider more serious issues like [B]netting [/B](please see video ... [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PQZhbJzdQ&feature=related[/url] ... as it is now very common and the main cause of worry), [B]pesticides [/B](as they have wiped partridge populations also), [B]habitat [/B](bela in case of partridge & water/wetlands in case of waterfowl) & [B]localized poaching [/B](with different methods of both waterfowl & partridge), to be of much more magnitude first. Frankly speaking, we as sport loving people are naturally inclined to be worried about the game''s future, and genuine shotgunning on gamebirds does very minimal damage as compared to major hazards mentioned above.\r\n\r\nBut, these updates on Wildlife Act come every year; the amendment in THE ACT was only made in 2007 October which I pasted; after that every year different updates vide notifications about hares, pigeons, doves etc have come from time to time, and changed yearly as per ground figures of wildlife (if I am not wrong). IT WOULD BE A NICE IDEA IF THIS THREAD IS USED TO INFO ABOUT LATEST UPDATES (OR AMENDMENTS IF ANY) FROM TIME TO TIME TO KEEP ALL MEMBERS INFORMED.\r\n\r\nYou see, there is a much different trend in the last few years. Local people have started poaching excessively with baits/nets/lures for meat or illegal trade. And the onus of that has fallen on shikaris which is definitely not just. That gets reflected in these wildlife act amendments and updates too. I think the whole system needs re-thinking. Pls correct me if I am wrong.', ''),

(332569, 'What''s so special about handguns made by Sig Sauer and H&amp;K? An informative Q/A...\r\n\r\n"So, lets start with the SIG. One of the things you are paying for is an all metal pistol. Generally, all metal guns are more expensive than polymer ones.\r\n\r\nIn most modern Sig''s they have a milled from billet aluminum frame with a high grade stainless slide. In a CZ75 (as the comparison gun) these are cast carbon steel frames which are coated. In addition, you are generally paying for tolerancing. Sig''s generally have exceptionally tight lockup without sacrificing accuracy. CZ75''s are more loose, and use a different design in the rails to give them accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn polymer, in the H&K you are generally paying for match barrels and other match grade components. Also the H&K design offers a bunch of different options for operation which you don''t have with a Glock or an XD. \r\n\r\nGenerally, just installing a match barrel into a gun isn''t enough to really improve it''s accuracy. Most of the time they need to be fitted which usually requires the services of a gun smith. Again, improving the trigger also usually is done by a gun smith or someone with those skills which also adds to the cost.\r\n\r\nNow, for example, you can get a CZ75 SP01 Shadow model which has a bunch of this sort of stuff done at the factory, but it will now cost about the same as a Sig 226. I''ve never had any problem with my Sig, but the slide stop bar broke on my SP01 due to a casting defect and had to be replaced. Since then it has run beautifully. \r\n\r\nNow getting a stock XD to shoot like an H&K will take some money for the trigger, a match barrel, new springs and again some work. It remains to be seen how the XDM does. At the moment it shows alot of promise as being a tremendous value for the performance.\r\n\r\nDo these guns have different life spans? Well, the best that I can say is that all of the models described have been through torture tests running out to the 100,000 round range. That''s alot of bullets. I''m not sure how much a difference is going to matter. \r\n\r\nCertainly the difference between the dollar and Euro effect the price, and the fact that Sigs are made in West Germany and CZ are made in the Czech Republic makes a difference.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, though the difference between a $300 gun and a $600 gun is pretty big. The difference between $600 and $1,000 is noticeable, but less. Between $1000 and $1,500 again noticable, but still less. So, shoot a stock 226 against a stock CZ75. For your first handgun buy you might not be able to tell the difference. In which case I''d save the money."\r\n\r\n[url]http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090609162825AAaoQrs[/url]', ''),

(332590, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nI was just reading up on free recoil energy notes and something else struck my mind. struck hard enough to do this immediately at 3am. :)\r\n\r\n[B]Kinetic Energy Vs Free Recoil Energy:[/B]\r\n\r\nKinetic energy is the energy delivered by a particular round. in case of 9mm it is around 367.63 ft-lbs (using weight and velocity figures suggested by AK47) against free recoil energy of 3.98 ft-lbs (weight of the weapon has been standardized for easier calculation at 1000 grams).\r\n\r\nKinetic energy of a 45ACP round is 368.9 f-lbs (using weight and velocity figures suggested by AK47) against against free recoil energy of 5.83 ft-lbs (weight of the weapon has been standardized for easier calculation at 1000 grams).\r\n\r\n[B]Now lets try to understand the results:[/B]\r\n\r\nA 45ACP only gives you 0.35% extra kinetic energy (not much difference in knock down power or the so called brute force) whereas it recoils higher by 48.46%.\r\n\r\nAnother look, a 9mm round is only 0.344% percent weaker in terms of kinetic energy whereas it recoils less by 31.7%.\r\n\r\nGentlemen! now I leave it up to you to decide which is a better round. if you want my understanding of the whole issue. I would say, 45ACP is definitely a better man-stopper however 9mm Parabellum is a more efficient man-stopper as you can see that it gives you almost the same level of kinetic energy against huge savings in terms of free recoil energy.\r\n\r\nas with lower free recoil energy you get the benefit of higher rate of fire, more accuracy in rapid firing, more control over the firearm and higher hit probability due to higher number of rounds going downrange. not to mention, through the tests we have seen that a 9mm HP makes a hole similar in size to a 45ACP FMJ.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(332592, 'My New Ultrasonic Gun Cleaner ! Salams,\n\nFor the past few weeks I was looking into Ultrasonic cleaning for my guns. The Ultrasonic gun cleaners I found online were quite expensive starting from about $ 200 and extending upwards of $ 1000. Cleaning liquid availability was also an issue since it would be inconvenient to have it imported on a regular basis. Reading Denovo''s post the other day in the Ultrasonic article thread, I thought the surgical shops might have some thing I could use. So off I went to the most convenient store and asked the owner if he had an Ultrasonic cleaner, he told me no and had never heard of such a thing. I was a little disappointed but after a few trips to Sitara market one learns to keep an eye out for something the shop keeper does not realize he has. I saw a dusty little box lying in a corner shelf and asked to see it. It turned out to be exactly what I was looking for, an Ultrasonic Cleaner ! The owner was a little confused as he struggled to remember it and after ruffling through some documents sold it to me for Rs. 4000. I then asked him if he had any sterilizing liquid and checked a few makes till I found one that catered to Ultrasonic equipment. A 150ml bottle of it cost me Rs. 500. \n\nBack home I could not wait to try my new cleaner. Since it was a first, I was a little hesitant to put my expensive gun barrels in it but then remembered a rusty almost junk local made Beretta 92fs barrel lying around. I had wasted a few hours on this barrel some time back trying to clean it using all conventional methods of rust removal / cleaning like hot water & soap, diesel, rust remover, mitti ki tail, Hoppes, WD40, gun oil and brass brushes but all had failed. I thought what better and more difficult test could I put to my new Ultrasonic cleaner.

The question should be replied by 12G bro himself, yet let me correct your thinking on the highlighted above, in simple terms.\n\nPenetration is related to velocity and perhaps also to the [I]tip-shaping[/I] of the bullets. Hence, since the 9mm travels, [I]average[/I], at some 1200fps and .45ACP at, [I]average[/I], 850-900 fps, and the 9mm projectile is sharper[I] nosed[/I] than the .45ACP, penetration of the 9mm will always be deeper. Penetration of .45ACP JHP''s would be lesser than of 9mm JHP''s, as for [I].45 [B]FMJ''s[/B] vs 9mm[B] HP[/B][/I], well, I guess they would come pretty close, yet unfortunately, we did not have more sheets in our MDF boards to check out the stoppage levels, all rounds except the .22 pierced through all 6 layers. \n\nOver to 12G bro, for more details.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(332791, ' 9mm Luger (Parabellum)\r\n\r\nHistorical Notes:-\r\nThe 9mm Luger, or 9mm Parabellum, was introduced with the Model of 1902 Luger automatic pistol. It was adopted by the German navy in 1904 and by the German army in 1908. Since that time, it has been used by the military of practically by every European power. It is the world''s most popular and widely-used military handgun cartridge. It has also been used extinsively in submachine guns. In the United States, Colt, Smith & Wesson, Ruger and many others chamber the 9mm, and there were too many foreign-made pistols to list here that are also available in it. In 1985, the 9mm was adopted as the official military cartridge by U.S. Armed forces (to replace the 45auto) along with the Beretta Model 92-F (M-9) 15-shot semi-auto pistol.\r\n\r\nGeneral Comments :-\r\nAlthough the 9mm Luger delivers rather good performance for police, military or sporting use, it was not very popular in the U.S. until fairly recently. The principal reason may have been that no American-made arms were chambered for it early on. In 1954, Smith & Wesson brought out their new Model 39 automatic in this calibre and Colt chambered their lighweight Commander for the 9mm Luger, as well as the 45 and 38 Super in 1951. This, plus the influx of surplus 9mm military automatics imported after the war, greatly increased its popularity and acceptance in the country. At the present time, it is probably as widely used by American handgunners as any of other automatic pistol cartridge except possibly 45 auto. The principal complaint has always been that the 9mm Luger lacks stopping power as a defensive cartridge, and there are plenty of examples to prove this point. Howeer, the only automatic pistol cartridge with proven stopping power is the 45 ACP.\r\n\r\nNote :- This all info is copied from a book named " CARTRIDGES OF THE WORLD "  6th edition printed in 1989.', ''),

(332793, ' 45 Automatic or 45 ACP\r\n\r\nHistorical Notes :-\r\nDeveloped by John Browning in 1905 and adopted by the United States Ordinance Department, with the Colt-Browning automatic pistol, in 1911, it has also been made the official military handgun calibre by several other governments., notably Argentina, Mexico and Norway. The 45 Automatic is the most powerful military handgun cartridge in use today. It is also one of the most difficult to master. The Colt Government auto pistol and the Colt and Smith & Wesson Army Model 1917 revolvers are the principal arms chambered for the 45 ACP in the United States. Several Submachine Guns have used it, and about 1943 a number of Reising semi-automatic rifles were marketed in this calibre. Imitations of the Colt auto pistols have been made in Argentina, China, Korea, Norway, Spain and the U.S. It was replaced as of 1985 as the official U.S. military handgun cartridge by the 9mm Parabellum.\r\n\r\nGeneral Comments :-\r\nThe 45 ACP has  been proven in combat all ove the world as having excellent stopping power. It has also developed into a first-class match cartridge with accuracy equal to the best. It requires a good deal of practice for the average person to develop any degree of skill with this cartridge, particularly when fired in the Colt Government Model Semi-Automatic. It is use far more for target shooting than hunting, its curved trajactory limiting its effective range. Although not a highly popular police calibre, a number of departments have switched from 38 Special to the 45 ACP in the past few years.', ''),

In 1989, a fresh policy was circulated which suggested that instead of using pull through and cloth excessively to clean foul deposits in the barrel, we should use oil soacked cloth ( Chindi ) and allow it to work on deposits. It will soften the residue in time and then make it easier to remove. Excessive wear and tear of barrel will be avoided.

The .357 Mag FMJ for sure would be "close" to 12 layers penetration, lolz!\n\nYet, it would be vital, that in order to do best comparison tests again, the boxes should be of same make MDF boards, gap between the layers constant as with those we tried out, all dimensions should be completely the same.

They will detain you and confiscate your mobile so that you are not able to make any calls. It is a long procedure afterwards and no need to mention it as you don''t want to get into such trouble in the first place. You can get away with the police but not rangers.\n\nQ3 On the National highway between karachi and sukkur,\nA) I have travelled many a times from Karachi to diff parts of Interior Sindh. There is Law and order situation on the highway. You cannot do much with a pistol because normally a group of 5 or more bad guys are involved in an act. Still IMHO one should carry a weapon. Have been stopped many times at check points on the highway and afterwards and the police let you go after understanding the reason and checking your license. There is no Rangers checking on the highway.\n\nQ4  On coming back from journey and again entering karachi,\nA) Same as Answer 1\n\nQ5 On coming back from journey and again entering karachi with section 144 imposed.\nA0 Same as Answer 2\n\nSOLUTION:  Insecure area starts from the highway so you need a weapon on the highway and afterwards. Pack your gun in a sealed manner without the magazine. Keep the packed magazine separate and bullets packed separate. Doing this means that you are transporting your weapon from Karachi to Sukkur and that is allowed by law when 144 is imposed. If Rangers stop you and you explain your transportation intention then they will let you go after checking the license. Once you are on the Highway, you may unpack the weapon and load it and carry on with your journey.\nReverse the procedure when you entering back Karachi.', ''),

(332935, ' 357 Magnum\r\n\r\nHistorical Notes :-\r\nIntroduced in 1935 by Smith & Wesson for their heavy-frame revolver. The ammunition was developed by Winchester in co-operation with Smith & Wesson. Major Douglas B. Wesson (of S&W) and Philip B. Sharpe are also credited with much of the final development work. The 357 Magnum is based on the 38 Special case lengthened about 1/10 inch, so it will not chamber in standard 38 Special revolvers. This was the most powerful handgun cartridge in the world until 44 Magnum was introduced in 1955. Colt, Ruger, Taurus and Smith & Wesson manufacture revolvers of various types for this cartridge. There has also been a proliferation of imported single and double-action revolvers and seeral single shot pistols chamber it. \r\n\r\nGeneral Comments :-\r\nProbably the most popular high-velosity handgun cartridge in the United States for police, hunting or target work. It provides about double the elocity and more than three times the energy of the standard 38 Special load. It is noted for its flat trajactory, deep penetration and great knock-down power. It has been used successfully on deer, black bear, elk and even grizzly bear. However, it is not really adequate for these large animals unless used by a good handgun shot. It is also used in repeating and single shot rifles as matched arms to go along with the revolver. In a  20 to 24-inch rifle barrel, the standard factory load will develop about 1650 fps muzzle velocity and special handloads will develop over 2000. It is considered the best all-round handgun hunting cartridge for small and medium game and, under proper conditions, for deer at shot range. During Korean conflict it was found to be very effective against the body armor used by the Communist forces.', ''),

Yes it is true what effect will 1 pistol have against 3 or 4 automatic illegal weapons that dacoits posess and they have planned and rehearsed the way to commit crime while I on the other hand am taken by surprise.\r\n\r\nLet me share an incident with rangers on the highway. Both these times i did not have any weapon with me. We were 3 people in car. First day they stop me. Ask all of us to get our. They searched all of us. They asked for my original nic. I gave them the nic. The ranger said that the photo on nic does not match my face (i had got nic renewed in 2009 with new photo that they took at nadra and this incident is of 2010 december). I was stunned. I told him look again. He calls his superior. He again says the same thing. They discuss between themselves. I tell them if you feel this way i have no explanation. They then return my nic saying i have gained weight and i am off.\r\n\r\nThe second day that same spot but this time other ranger individuals stop me again with 3 people in car. They told us to get out of car. But to my amazement they did not search me nor ask for my nic and let us go. They searched the other 2 people with me.\r\n\r\nThese two incidents got me thinking and i posted this question. I felt very helpless in first situation. Also i learned there is no uniformity in there actions and it all rests on there mood swings.\r\n\r\nAnother question. In your opinion. How would the 1st rangers group have acted if they found loaded handgun in car. How second group would have acted if they found loaded handgun in car.

(333075, ' As for the costs, haven''t really thought about it but this is a good time as any to do a mental exercise.  one 150 Ml bottle of cleaner costs Rs. 500 which in turn mixed with water in a ratio of 9/10 water 1/10 cleaner is good for cleaning 13-15 times. Each time I can clean two gun barrels, springs, firing pin, guide rod etc. So 13x2 = 26 guns cleaned.

(333119, ' 357 Magnum\r\n\r\nHistorical Notes :-\r\nIntroduced in 1935 by Smith & Wesson for their heavy-frame revolver. The ammunition was developed by Winchester in co-operation with Smith & Wesson. Major Douglas B. Wesson (of S&W) and Philip B. Sharpe are also credited with much of the final development work. The 357 Magnum is based on the 38 Special case lengthened about 1/10 inch, so it will not chamber in standard 38 Special revolvers. This was the most powerful handgun cartridge in the world until 44 Magnum was introduced in 1955. Colt, Ruger, Taurus and Smith & Wesson manufacture revolvers of various types for this cartridge. There has also been a proliferation of imported single and double-action revolvers and seeral single shot pistols chamber it. \r\n\r\nGeneral Comments :-\r\nProbably the most popular high-velosity handgun cartridge in the United States for police, hunting or target work. It provides about double the elocity and more than three times the energy of the standard 38 Special load. It is noted for its flat trajactory, deep penetration and great knock-down power. It has been used successfully on deer, black bear, elk and even grizzly bear. However, it is not really adequate for these large animals unless used by a good handgun shot. It is also used in repeating and single shot rifles as matched arms to go along with the revolver. In a 20 to 24-inch rifle barrel, the standard factory load will develop about 1650 fps muzzle velocity and special handloads will develop over 2000. It is considered the best all-round handgun hunting cartridge for small and medium game and, under proper conditions, for deer at shot range. During Korean conflict it was found to be very effective against the body armor used by the Communist forces.', ''),
(333120, ' 45 Automatic or 45 ACP\r\n\r\nHistorical Notes :-\r\nDeveloped by John Browning in 1905 and adopted by the United States Ordinance Department, with the Colt-Browning automatic pistol, in 1911, it has also been made the official military handgun calibre by several other governments., notably Argentina, Mexico and Norway. The 45 Automatic is the most powerful military handgun cartridge in use today. It is also one of the most difficult to master. The Colt Government auto pistol and the Colt and Smith & Wesson Army Model 1917 revolvers are the principal arms chambered for the 45 ACP in the United States. Several Submachine Guns have used it, and about 1943 a number of Reising semi-automatic rifles were marketed in this calibre. Imitations of the Colt auto pistols have been made in Argentina, China, Korea, Norway, Spain and the U.S. It was replaced as of 1985 as the official U.S. military handgun cartridge by the 9mm Parabellum.\r\n\r\nGeneral Comments :-\r\nThe 45 ACP has been proven in combat all ove the world as having excellent stopping power. It has also developed into a first-class match cartridge with accuracy equal to the best. It requires a good deal of practice for the average person to develop any degree of skill with this cartridge, particularly when fired in the Colt Government Model Semi-Automatic. It is use far more for target shooting than hunting, its curved trajactory limiting its effective range. Although not a highly popular police calibre, a number of departments have switched from 38 Special to the 45 ACP in the past few years.', ''),
(333121, ' 9mm Luger (Parabellum)\r\n\r\nHistorical Notes:-\r\nThe 9mm Luger, or 9mm Parabellum, was introduced with the Model of 1902 Luger automatic pistol. It was adopted by the German navy in 1904 and by the German army in 1908. Since that time, it has been used by the military of practically by every European power. It is the world''s most popular and widely-used military handgun cartridge. It has also been used extinsively in submachine guns. In the United States, Colt, Smith & Wesson, Ruger and many others chamber the 9mm, and there were too many foreign-made pistols to list here that are also available in it. In 1985, the 9mm was adopted as the official military cartridge by U.S. Armed forces (to replace the 45auto) along with the Beretta Model 92-F (M-9) 15-shot semi-auto pistol.\r\n\r\nGeneral Comments :-\r\nAlthough the 9mm Luger delivers rather good performance for police, military or sporting use, it was not very popular in the U.S. until fairly recently. The principal reason may have been that no American-made arms were chambered for it early on. In 1954, Smith & Wesson brought out their new Model 39 automatic in this calibre and Colt chambered their lighweight Commander for the 9mm Luger, as well as the 45 and 38 Super in 1951. This, plus the influx of surplus 9mm military automatics imported after the war, greatly increased its popularity and acceptance in the country. At the present time, it is probably as widely used by American handgunners as any of other automatic pistol cartridge except possibly 45 auto. The principal complaint has always been that the 9mm Luger lacks stopping power as a defensive cartridge, and there are plenty of examples to prove this point. Howeer, the only automatic pistol cartridge with proven stopping power is the 45 ACP.', ''),

(333135, ' The 22 Long Rifle is not only the most popular match cartridge in existence, but also one of the more widely used small game and varmint calibers. The high-velocity hollowpoint is the best field load, and it''ll do a fairly good job on rabbit-sizes animals out to 75 yards or so. zbeyond that it is unreliable and can be a great wounder and crippler at any range if the bullet is poorly placed. Regardless , the long rifle is, unfortunately, a great favorite of many poachers for killing deer with close-up head shots. The low report does not alarm or alert local game wardens. The solid high-velocity Long Rifle will, at close range, penetrate 6 inches plus of pine and has a maximum range of close to mile. Maximum range is achieved at the relatively low angle of between 25-30 degrees , so one must be ery careful. Humans shot with the 22 Long Rifle hae a tendency to show little immediate distress, to survive without complications for several days, than die very suddenly. This is mentioned because altogether too many individuals are prone to regard the 22 rimfires as more play-things, not powerful enough to be dangerous. Careless shooting with the 22 rimfire has probably closed more areas to hunting and caused more trouble than any other dozen calibers. Use your head and be careful! There is also a 22 Long Rifle shot cartridge loaded by most companies.', ''),

You want a cure for the flinch? \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCount out loud: ONE TWO. \r\n\r\nNow do it again faster: ONE TWO. \r\n\r\nAnd again real fast: ONE TWO. \r\n\r\nNow point with your pistol using a normal 2 hand hold with both of your thumbs pointing in the same direction as the barrel. \r\nWith your pistol pointed below the target, bring it up slowly to the target. As soon as you are on target say "ONE". Now say "TWO" and pull the trigger at the same time. ONE = found target TWO = bang. \r\n\r\nWhen you are bringing your pistol onto the target, this is hunt mode. Hunt mode can be from side to side or bottom to top. Start traning with bottom to top as explained above. When you find your target say "ONE". When you say "TWO" pull the trigger. \r\n\r\nOne Two = Target Bang\r\n\r\nWhy does the ONE TWO method work? It keeps you from thinking too much and removes indecision. Thinking too much and holding your aim on target too long causes the wiggles. Anticipating the recoil and bang causes fliches. Counting out loud ONE TWO gets your mind off the recoil and bang. After hours of training using ONE TWO, reflexes start taking over and you start shooting good. \r\n\r\nFor further read :[url]http://www.best9mm.com/shootingtip.html[/url]', ''),

A Taurus wont break unless having metal casting issues in slide stops, trigger springs and slide/frame components  etc.\nSame criteria stands true for other brands... Also note that single stack magazine will give more reliability over all than double stacks.\nPlastic guide rods also tend to melt on continous firing which incase any pistol having that and going through continous firing test would melt its guide rod.\nAnd do check the shooter grip and firing technique in this continous firing session. Any one less expert than him would cause any gun to malfunction more than usual keeping aside ammo and magazine issues.\n \nAll above mentioned factors count. Plus real torture test would not only comprise of continous firing in a controlled schema. This test should rather be called Continous firing test ONLY.', ''),

(333357, ' Apart from inconsistent amount of gun powder, bullets used are not copper jacketed. Core is mostly cast iron instead of lead. \nYou can verify this by scratching the jacket of Desi bullet with a key. Copper jacket when scracthed gives same color(Goldenish color) in the scratch area as rest of the jacket. Desi bullet when scratched will give a silverish color scratch and also note that it is too hard for barrel''s rifling to engage such type of foul jacketed bullets completely. Also desi bullets are not well formed and not consistant in shape and diameter. This also prevent these bullets to form tight seal with the gases which are pushing at the base of the bullet while it is going down the barrel.\nSuch bullets destroy the rifling of your barrel. Some may leave the barrel at good velocity and some may hit the ground at 50 meters. That is why difference in recoil is felt. Also the gun powder used is of third class and having impurities and inconsistant particles lead to incomplete powder burning leading to different peak pressures. The primers used are also of WW2 era having corossive effect leading to barrel damage if less care is given in cleaning procedure.\nThere are just too many things wrong in desi bullets its hard to explain in short time. :)', ''),

Corresponding model in Tanfoglio line of pistols is the Tanfoglio Force Police/Carry. It is a cross of Carry and Police 2011 lineup. Basically it is a Tanfoglio pistol assembled under the license by Armscor in Philippines. All parts are made in Italy in Tanfoglio Factory located in Gardone Val Trompia, a small town which is famous for firearm manufacturing facilities of Beretta, Tanfoglio and Pietta.[/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT] \n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]Price tag was PKR 48,000 only and I purchased it from National Traders [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]in November 2010.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri][B]DAY 1 pictures:[/B][/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[IMG]http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee379/midreestaj/2010-12-05_20-57-15_519.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee379/midreestaj/2010-12-05_20-56-59_11.jpg[/IMG]\n \n \n[B][FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][U]Design:[/U][/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]This pistol is a compact semi-auto platform, hammer fired and polymer [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]framed, yielding Browning short action recoil operation in tilt barrel [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]configuration. Its locking operation is similar to 1911 design where ribs [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]formed just ahead the chamber on the barrel, lock with the projections in the ceiling [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]of the slide. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]Tanfoglio pistols are CZ75 based design which is then based on [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]1911/Hi-Power design. Tanfoglios are more close to CZs as their slides ride [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]inside the frame. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]Sights are low profiled and snag free 3-dot system. Front sight is [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]fixed and rear sight is LPA having two Allen screws, thus windage adjustment is [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]allowed. Barrel is hard chromed externally only. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]Recoil spring assembly is two-piece (un-captured) with a single [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]spring and guide rod is made of steel.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]Magazines are marked (T) on them which is Tanfoglio insignia and [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]are 16-rounders.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]Finish on the slide is Parkerized black and very smooth. Trigger [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]is made of metal not plastic. Frame has picatinny rails for mounting [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]accessories. Quality of machining is A-grade inside and outside nearly [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]flawless.[/FONT][/SIZE] \n \n[B]After 1st cleaning:[/B]\n \n[IMG]http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee379/midreestaj/2010-12-05_21-11-54_808.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee379/midreestaj/2010-12-05_21-12-56_242.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee379/midreestaj/MyTanfoglioMAPP1.jpg[/IMG]\n \n \n[B][FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][U]Ergonomics & Safety:[/U][/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]Ergonomics are just great. Grip is fantastic, safety position is [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]natural and, the trigger is a little creepy but, light enough to be enjoyed. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]This pistol implements firing pin block safety to prevent accidental discharges. There is no decocker, safety is traditional style enabling weapon to be carried cocked and locked. Hammer can be downed by pulling trigger on a live round and lowering hammer with thumb carefully.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]I really liked this design as it is an improvisation of CZ75B [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]design first time with polymer frame (full size, 16-round high capacity grip) [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]with shortened slide and barrel. This attribute gives the pistol high capacity [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]and compact size at the same time. It is rather a hybrid platform having [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]characteristics of full frame but yet a compact pistol.

I tested it and here is how I [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]tested. I let close both of my eyes and produced the pistol in my generic grip [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]pattern thinking behind my mind that I was pointing my pistol on the enemy in a [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]dark room. At this point, I let my eyes open and to my surprise I see all 3 [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]white dots in 1-line automatically under my natural grip. It&#8217;s a point and shoot [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]pistol in my opinion and that&#8217;s really great.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]One thing is very noticeable and that is, the recoil is minimal. [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]Compared to my polymer Taurus model 809, it significantly kicks less and while [/FONT][/SIZE][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]it does kick, the recoil perceived is soft and tamed. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3]I managed to fire 82 rounds today, with no malfunction of any kind [/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]at all. All bang bang story till the end.

I was surprised to see that it would drop hammer on [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]pressing trigger even when the slide was held a little bit retracted. It was an [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]alarming situation indeed. Did some research and wrote an email to Armscor for [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]the same.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]YES! It is normal for a CZ design to fire/drop hammer when the [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]slide is retracted less than .25 of an inch. In such cases the barrel is [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]still not separated with the slide. However the barrel is in lock up but it has [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]already moved backwards along with the slide in a connected state. This alarmed [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]me at first but research showed it is normal. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]If a CZ or CZ based design is still dropping hammer even if the [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]slide was retracted to .25&#8221; and up (greater than 6mm), it has trigger/sear problem which needs to [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]be checked otherwise, it would fire out of battery.[/FONT]\n \n \n \n[FONT=Calibri]Regards.[/FONT]', ''),

(333553, 'Sight Pictures: which one do you use and why? Acquiring a correct and consistent sigh picture is vital for any type of competition shooting whether it is hunting, or bulls eye.  Over the course of marksmen ship development, many different types of sight pictures or holds were developed. Varying all but very slightly physically, They offer pros and cons making them ideal for one application, and a very bad choice for another. \nEven though this is a very vital part of shooting, I think many of us around here have not looked into the various types out there and pay little attention to it. I was researching a specific type of sight picture and came to know many things about them. Here&#8217;s to sharing: D\nPlease reply with which picture do you use and why. Also, &#8220;I use this sight picture because I didn&#8217;t know about any other&#8221; is a perfectly valid answer :)\n\nHere are the popular sight pictures.\n\n[B]Center Hold:\n[/B]\nCenter hold is also called point of aim point of impact, the simplest the most common amongst the 4 listed here.\n[img]http://s3.postimage.org/31eb7xrt0/center_hold.jpg[/img]\n\n[B]\n6 o Clock\n[/B]\nUsually used in competitive shooting where distance and the size of bullseye is known. \nWhen you think about the 6&#8217;oclock sight picture (for example) and a bulls eye, most of us imagine it like this: (which is wrong by the way). \n\n[img]http://s3.postimage.org/31fn6iu4k/sight.jpg[/img]\n\nPlease also note the assumption that a typical riffle front post extends 6 MOA as per the standard width. Hence the bulls eye on 50 yards rifle targets is about 3 inches in diameter and 6 inches at 100. If the front post also extends 6inches at 100 yards (6moa) it would place the point of impact at exactly one half the width of the front post above the front post. Imagine a circle the same diameter as the width of the front post. Put this imaginary circle on top of the front post. Your point of impact should now be in the center of the front post. Hence a perfectly zeroed gun for 6 o clock hold would put the POI exactly above the front post. Since its easier to place the imaginary circle in the center of the bulls eye when you can see the bulls eye. While using a center hold, half the bullseye is not visible. Its is therefore that the 6 o clock hold is favored for target shooting.\n[B]Correct 6 o Clock:\n[/B][img]http://s3.postimage.org/31emsp79g/6oclock.jpg[/img]\n\n[B]Flat Tire\n[/B]\nA variation of the 6 o clock hold. \n\n[img]http://s3.postimage.org/31ewpxa84/flat_tire.jpg[/img]\n\n[B]Sub 6 or White line hold\n[/B]\nJust like the 6 o clock hold, except that there is a little line between the bullseye and the front post.\n[img]http://s3.postimage.org/31fgkdg5g/sub6.jpg[/img]', ''),

(333559, ' 45 Automatic or 45 ACP\r\n\r\nHistorical Notes :-\r\nDeveloped by John Browning in 1905 and adopted by the United States Ordinance Department, with the Colt-Browning automatic pistol, in 1911, it has also been made the official military handgun calibre by several other governments., notably Argentina, Mexico and Norway. The 45 Automatic is the most powerful military handgun cartridge in use today. It is also one of the most difficult to master. The Colt Government auto pistol and the Colt and Smith & Wesson Army Model 1917 revolvers are the principal arms chambered for the 45 ACP in the United States. Several Submachine Guns have used it, and about 1943 a number of Reising semi-automatic rifles were marketed in this calibre. Imitations of the Colt auto pistols have been made in Argentina, China, Korea, Norway, Spain and the U.S. It was replaced as of 1985 as the official U.S. military handgun cartridge by the 9mm Parabellum.\r\n\r\nGeneral Comments :-\r\nThe 45 ACP has been proven in combat all ove the world as having excellent stopping power. It has also developed into a first-class match cartridge with accuracy equal to the best. It requires a good deal of practice for the average person to develop any degree of skill with this cartridge, particularly when fired in the Colt Government Model Semi-Automatic. It is use far more for target shooting than hunting, its curved trajactory limiting its effective range. Although not a highly popular police calibre, a number of departments have switched from 38 Special to the 45 ACP in the past few years.', ''),
(333560, ' 357 Magnum\r\n\r\nHistorical Notes :-\r\nIntroduced in 1935 by Smith & Wesson for their heavy-frame revolver. The ammunition was developed by Winchester in co-operation with Smith & Wesson. Major Douglas B. Wesson (of S&W) and Philip B. Sharpe are also credited with much of the final development work. The 357 Magnum is based on the 38 Special case lengthened about 1/10 inch, so it will not chamber in standard 38 Special revolvers. This was the most powerful handgun cartridge in the world until 44 Magnum was introduced in 1955. Colt, Ruger, Taurus and Smith & Wesson manufacture revolvers of various types for this cartridge. There has also been a proliferation of imported single and double-action revolvers and seeral single shot pistols chamber it. \r\n\r\nGeneral Comments :-\r\nProbably the most popular high-velosity handgun cartridge in the United States for police, hunting or target work. It provides about double the elocity and more than three times the energy of the standard 38 Special load. It is noted for its flat trajactory, deep penetration and great knock-down power. It has been used successfully on deer, black bear, elk and even grizzly bear. However, it is not really adequate for these large animals unless used by a good handgun shot. It is also used in repeating and single shot rifles as matched arms to go along with the revolver. In a 20 to 24-inch rifle barrel, the standard factory load will develop about 1650 fps muzzle velocity and special handloads will develop over 2000. It is considered the best all-round handgun hunting cartridge for small and medium game and, under proper conditions, for deer at shot range. During Korean conflict it was found to be very effective against the body armor used by the Communist forces.', ''),

I replaced the recoil spring anyway, in it and the companion Model 19 that I bought in 1995 as a precaution. The Model 19 has some of the Tennifer coating worn from the inside of the barrel near the muzzle from the thousands of rounds that have been fired through it. Consequently that part of the barrel tends to rust of I don''t keep it oiled.\n\nThe other Model 19, Model 23, and Model 26 are all fairly new since I purchased them in 2007, 2011, and 2009 respectively, so they show no wear. Maybe in ten years they will get a little worn.\n\nGlock is the best investment in a pistol that I know of. But, I do have high hopes for the Caracal line of pistols.

With 92-year-old Mr Mandela’s health fading, the trustees fear it is their last chance to find the weapon in his lifetime.\nIn late July 1962, perhaps mindful that his days of freedom were numbered, Mr Mandela wrapped the Makarov pistol in foil and an army uniform and buried it under a tin plate along with 200 rounds of ammunition in a 1.5-metre deep pit.', ''),

The problem with this is only that it''s quite of a "stickier" substance, not advisable to be used on those internal parts of the gun which require a smooth functioning. Or say, even on the rail channels. Can get "gummier" with heat and use, hence can/may cause jams. At least a shooter would not feel confident with it, so Chief rightly suggested against. \r\n\r\nI''d advise you any good CLP product, and Brunox is an excellent kind of same, most of us use. It''s thinner in [I]viscosity[/I] than WD40, quicker with cleaning, tripple function, and if you spray the internals after final cleaning, and instead of patching/absorbing it up with a cloth,  use a hair-dryer lightly to blow away excess, rest assured you get a very effective, thin layer of protective "film" on the internals of your gun, rust protecting.\r\n\r\nLarger can is for Rs. 600 or so, half can Rs. 300.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

The problem with this is only that it''s quite of a "stickier" substance, not advisable to be used on those internal parts of the gun which require a smooth functioning. Or say, even on the rail channels. Can get "gummier" with heat and use, hence can/may cause jams. At least a shooter would not feel confident with it, so Chief rightly suggested against. \r\n\r\nI''d advise you any good CLP product, and Brunox is an excellent kind of same, most of us use. It''s thinner in [I]viscosity[/I] than WD40, quicker with cleaning, tripple function, and if you spray the internals after final cleaning, and instead of patching/absorbing it up with a cloth,  use a hair-dryer lightly to blow away excess, rest assured you get a very effective, thin layer of protective "film" on the internals of your gun, rust protecting.\r\n\r\nLarger can is for Rs. 600 or so, half can Rs. 300.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\n@Sir AK47: I am obliged', ''),

So, there is no more need to ponder whether you have chosen the best small-bore caliber when you can have them all in one package!\r\n\r\n[URL="http://www.sako.fi/sakoquad.php"]SaKO Quad Complete Details[/URL]\r\n\r\nHere is the [URL="http://www.sako.fi/pdf/manuals/Quad.pdf"]Manual[/URL]\r\n\r\nChilzzz', ''),

It was a great trip as far as business part is concerned but a very dull as far as pleasure is, due to continues rain, 60 mph gusts and cold weather. \nMet Slayerjutt bro on last day in Manchester (just before I was leaving) for only half an hour,thanks Slayer bro for coming to the hotel and sorry again for not being able to contact you earlier, will have fun on my next trip Inshallah.\nI would like to share one very unusual (for me atleast) thing that I witnessed, me and my friend (whom I call A''aqa because of his very peculiar kinky habits :tape2:  ) were roaming in a street with lot of homo;) clubs, there we saw 2 policemen walking around, A''aqa said lets have some fun with them, I was like "what? I dont want to spend a night in Manchester''s Hawalat" but he went to them and had this dialogue,\nA''aga... Hi guys, what are these clubs like, we tried to go in but they say it only for GAYs?\n\nP.M.: [B]Sir[/B] these are Gays only clubs.\n\nA: What is Gay?\n\nP.M.: I am sorry [B]Sir[/B] but you can ask anyone outside the club.\n\nA: But why dont you tell me what Gay is, you are here to help.\n\nP.M.: [B]Sir[/B], absolutely we are here to help but the thing you want helping in is something we cant.\n\nA: OK I will ask some one else but at least tell me "ARE YOU BOTH GAY"?\n\nnow at that point I started looking for the route I will run to :mod: but to my surprise both policemen looked at each other smiled back and started walking their way.

Both of these shotguns are very popular, therefore this can be assumed there is no problem in either of the mechanism.\r\n\r\nMost of us well understand the gas mechanism whereas in the inertia system there is a spring behind the bolt, when a shot is fired:\r\nThe bolt moves rearward. It eject the fired shell, cock the sear assembly and compress the spring behind the both that absorb major portion of recoil energy, the remaining cycle i.e loading of new shell is done by the force of spring that pushes the bolt forward.\r\n\r\nThe inertia operated semi autos have less number of parts therefore they are light in weight and require less energies and time for maintenance i.e. cleaning, lubrication, etc. \r\n\r\nWhen comes to general hunting and shooting that we do difference in the recoil, cycling rate, etc. does not matter because we cannot distinguish between minute differences.\r\n\r\nYes each 100 grams of weight does matter because on hunting especially the upland one has to carry his gun for hours of rough and hard walk\r\n\r\nOne friend of mine has both berretta and benelli and he like benelli the most without any problem. \r\nThere is another person I know who is a friend of my colleague have benelli.

I tried putting in a box of cal .45 ACP and could estimate that it would be able to take same quantity of this caliber with the packaging of the .45 boxes.\n\nThe second can will go to storage of 9mm''s, and I believe the can would be accommodating min 1000 rds of this caliber!\n\nCheck below:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting001Small.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting002Small-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting003Small-1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting004Small-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe rubber seal can be seen all around the top lid:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting005Small-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSpecial locking lug ensures total airtightness.\n\nThanks again Zaheer bro, you really made my day today, whilst I was still trying to get out of the sick-bed, these boxes really got me working, lolz!\n\nRegards.', ''),
(334315, ' I own an m2000,\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a very good looking gun and light weight. Operation is very simple and the gun is very easy to clean. Inertia Drive''s are supposed to be amongst the fastest cycling guns.\r\n\r\nIf you use the gun for hunting and with more powerful ammo, it works just fine. However, given the slightest variance in ammo quality and it may refuse to cycle. Mine did not cycle Shaheen #9 Skeet rounds as they are very lightly charged. I also had some issues with other Shaheen rounds but those rounds also did not fire fully in a gas operated shotgun and sounded really funny :)\r\n\r\nHowever, I have yet to give the gun a proper break-in so its too early for a definite verdict. When it fires, it''s beautiful. Break-in is with about two boxes of high power rounds.\r\n\r\nApparently, this is amongst those guns which cannot be fired out of the box and the clean-up procedure as described in online forums is a complete take down and removal of all internals including the trigger group and related internals. That may seem daunting at first, but then again the simplicity of the gun counters that. Maybe a good armorer can clean it for you before you fire if you are not sure of doing it yourself. The reason explained is that the internals are coated with a very thick gel kind of substance which counters rust in storage and shipping and that must be removed to free up the moving parts.\r\n\r\nMay I ask the current price if you have inquired from the dealer? I got it for 53k from PARA Lahore in 2009.\r\n\r\nCheers.', ''),

Better is once or twice go there directly hire a boat man and scout the sand beds upstream Rasool Village, than you should be your own guide always in future.\nSecondly; I think Mr.Zarar and Dr.Hanif can be good companion there if they like to join as well as you can contact me too first for just survey the spots.

(334398, ' Beretta is neither ALL gas operated and maybe Benelli not ALL inertia/recoil operated .... Beretta introd Pintail 3901 semi auto which is inertia driven mech & Benelli might have one gas oper too .... MAIN POINT IS: Inertia driven is not the thing for Pakistani market bec of Shaheen (31g and 25g loads) though it is selling to some extent. Inertia driven (recoil operated) semi autos do not function reliably 100% every time with our Shaheen especially the 25 grams skeet and trap loads. I have used a Benelli custom piece Montefeltro owned by a friend and seen it malfunction with our Shaheen cartridge, whereas good gas operated guns like Berettas A303, A304, AL390, AL391, A400 and Baikal MP153, Browning B-80, Gold, Maxus etc, Lanber, Lugi Franchi 2 very good models ... all super gas semi auto shotguns. The best selling semi auto in USA is Benelli (Vinci or M2 etc) ... why??? bec it has inertia and a high quality mechanism as Americans mainly are fond of high velocity shells and mags and super mag shotshells and inertia driven mech reduces felt recoil as you increase the shell powder/charge/grams wheras gas-oper mech does not. Therefore, Xplor Unico is now being made with kick-off to handle high powder charge and magnum cartridges but again for Pakistani market Kickoff is of lesser use. ... and of crs the easy management (lesser & hassle free maintenance) and much lesser tendency to get jammed (sticky) in wet frosty foggy weather of an inertia driven semi is of obvious advantage to Americans.\r\n\r\nI would recom Trig Happy to definitely go for a good brand and model gas gun, n among 4 choices that he himself listed, Baikal MP153 (28" brl ; weight 7.6 lbs) outperforms anytime.... in wooden 28" barrel with 5 chokes newer models and to make it an even excellent performer, instal a Hiviz Compsight OR Bradley style white bead 0.125" to 0.135" dia approx bead on it (maybe added with a mid bead for quick target acquisition) and an extended Precision Hunter OR Briley Extended choke. Light Modified choke constriction for all purpose hunting (duck and upland). The choke costs $40 and sight $30 approx from USA.

(334421, ' Thank you brothers for your response.   I am getting mixed reviews.  So I guess it comes out to personal preference.  One thing I don''t understand is how a person can determine the accuracy of the gun.  Like if I shoot from berretta 92, it is a heavier gun than glock so I could be little more accurate, but is the gun doesn''t fit in my hand properly then when I pull the trigger then my hand with move and hence can make less accurate.  So I think it would be the personal choice right, whatever fits your hand perfectly.\n\nPlease let me know if my analysis is correct.  Also I still want to know how I can obtain a firearms permit in Pakistan.  When Raymond Davis is allowed to carry then I should be able to get one with no problem.', ''),

(334462, 'The Baikal Mp 512m airgun; The Baikal Mp 512m airgun; The gun i got had no box, no manual nothing at all, i just got the gun in a Chinese air gun''s box though it was NIb.\r\n\r\nergonomics:\r\nthe first thing that you will notice upon laying your hands on a Baikal mp512m is how handy it is i.e. light weight and compact in size compared to other airguns. just weighing a little over 2.25 kg and measuring 42 inches in length the gun gives you a perfect balance and the right feeling on the shoulder. the barrel length is around 17 inches.\r\nSights:\r\nThe gun is equipped with a metal rear sight whereas the front sights outer body is made of soft cheap looking plastic. the cap on the muzzle nose has to be unscrewed anti clock wise to open the front sight. however the rear sight has two way adjustments i.e. vertical and horizontal, which sometimes can be really difficult to sight in for perfect shots. unlike diana on the rear sight vertical adjustment dial has no numbers on it. The front sight is too thick in breadth that one is unable to see target when aiming, however a little horizontal foiling of the front sight always helps.\r\n\r\nThe Stock:\r\nThe wooden stock on the Baikal has no checkering or a cheekpeice and the wood also seems to be a cheap one. The stock has a polished finished, that gives the gun a softer look.. The recoil pad is a cheap plastic.\r\n\r\nSafety:\r\nThe Baikal Mp512m comes with an automatic on board safety that turns on the time you cock the gun, hence meaning the gun has no chance of firing when the barrel is open because the safety doesn''t turns off if the barrel isn''t fully closed. That means that there is no way you can decock the air gun unlike the traditional airguns. due to its safety feature once the gun has been cocked it has to fired. Besides that if you disengage the safety there is no way to manually turn on the safety again. for that purpose you will have to open the barrel again and let the automatic safety work. the safety lock is located in in front of the trigger.\r\n\r\nTrigger:\r\nI found Baikal mp512m''s trigger to be acceptable always firing when you expect and want to fire it, the trigger on the Baikal mp512m is not an adjustable one, however the trigger is consistent and shoots at a perfect stage of pull.\r\n\r\nPOWER:\r\nThe Baikal mp 512m''s stated is 623 FPS for 0.22 cal 5.5mm. But there is a slight confusion in that velocity as the "M" in MP512(M) stands for magnum, so this might be the velocity with magnum pellets. Unfortunately i couldn''t get my hands on magnum pellets and didn''t get a chance to see there performance. however the pellets i used Diana,diablo, gamo match, irani all were standing loose in the air gun and were falling about 0.5 to 0.75 inches down the breach, which in result reduces power. I shot more than 100 birds with the gun and even the loose pellets passed through each bird. however most of the times the birds didn''t fall right in there spot but fell after some time after bleeding maybe that was due to the lack of stopping power due the absence of magnum pellets.\r\n\r\n\r\nconclusion:\r\nThe gun comes with a price tag of 18k -20k. I fired more than 1000 pellets through it in 15 days but the gun didn''t feel like moving down. If you want to buy this gun just be sure that you will be willing to use magnum pellets with it.Otherwise the gun is a good value for money. And one more thing when it comes to airguns one always misses the name of Diana. :)', 'The Baikal Mp 512m airgun');

(334482, 'Baikal Airgun 5.5mm .22 cal review The gun i got had no box, no manual nothing at all, i just got the gun in a Chinese air gun''s box though it was NIb.\r\n\r\nergonomics:\r\nthe first thing that you will notice upon laying your hands on a Baikal mp512m is how handy it is i.e. light weight and compact in size compared to other airguns. just weighing a little over 2.25 kg and measuring 42 inches in length the gun gives you a perfect balance and the right feeling on the shoulder. the barrel length is around 17 inches.\r\nSights:\r\nThe gun is equipped with a metal rear sight whereas the front sights outer body is made of soft cheap looking plastic. the cap on the muzzle nose has to be unscrewed anti clock wise to open the front sight. however the rear sight has two way adjustments i.e. vertical and horizontal, which sometimes can be really difficult to sight in for perfect shots. unlike diana on the rear sight vertical adjustment dial has no numbers on it. The front sight is too thick in breadth that one is unable to see target when aiming, however a little horizontal foiling of the front sight always helps.\r\n\r\nThe Stock:\r\nThe wooden stock on the Baikal has no checkering or a cheekpeice and the wood also seems to be a cheap one. The stock has a polished finished, that gives the gun a softer look.. The recoil pad is a cheap plastic.\r\n\r\nSafety:\r\nThe Baikal Mp512m comes with an automatic on board safety that turns on the time you cock the gun, hence meaning the gun has no chance of firing when the barrel is open because the safety doesn''t turns off if the barrel isn''t fully closed. That means that there is no way you can decock the air gun unlike the traditional airguns. due to its safety feature once the gun has been cocked it has to fired. Besides that if you disengage the safety there is no way to manually turn on the safety again. for that purpose you will have to open the barrel again and let the automatic safety work. the safety lock is located in in front of the trigger.\r\n\r\nTrigger:\r\nI found Baikal mp512m''s trigger to be acceptable always firing when you expect and want to fire it, the trigger on the Baikal mp512m is not an adjustable one, however the trigger is consistent and shoots at a perfect stage of pull.\r\n\r\nPOWER:\r\nThe Baikal mp 512m''s stated is 623 FPS for 0.22 cal 5.5mm. But there is a slight confusion in that velocity as the "M" in MP512(M) stands for magnum, so this might be the velocity with magnum pellets. Unfortunately i couldn''t get my hands on magnum pellets and didn''t get a chance to see there performance. however the pellets i used Diana,diablo, gamo match, irani all were standing loose in the air gun and were falling about 0.5 to 0.75 inches down the breach, which in result reduces power. I shot more than 100 birds with the gun and even the loose pellets passed through each bird. however most of the times the birds didn''t fall right in there spot but fell after some time after bleeding maybe that was due to the lack of stopping power due the absence of magnum pellets.\r\n\r\n\r\nconclusion:\r\nThe gun comes with a price tag of 18k -20k. I fired more than 1000 pellets through it in 15 days but the gun didn''t feel like moving down. If you want to buy this gun just be sure that you will be willing to use magnum pellets with it.Otherwise the gun is a good value for money. And one more thing when it comes to airguns one always misses the name of Diana.', ''),

(334601, ' Trig Happy you raised a valid qs ... i.e. Inertia driven or gas oper? This has to be decided first, then budget and then make/model ... you cannot just choose ANY shotgun that ''fits'' you when choosing semiauto shotguns, especially with local Shaheen cartridge usage, skeet and regular shot loads i mean. There are terms like following that hv to b considered:\r\n*All loads cycling i.e. self adjusting gas mechanism ... which enables lower gram like 25g skeet loads to cycle easily too as well as higher gram high velocity and charge cartridges too. Never use Shaheen Super or Xcel with a gas oper gun, u can use imported gd brand high velocity.\r\n*Maintenance is of far lesser weightage when loads are getting stuck without cyling, like Shaheen loads do with inertia driven guns.\r\n*Recoil is less with gas oper guns\r\n\r\nMy recommendation: Try to get A303 or A390 by Beretta or Remington''s 11-87 or Spanish Lanber, which are all around 100K price category (+/-). Try a slightly used gun if price exceeds a bit above that range. If you are in Lhr, I can recom u a Spanish Lanber semi-auto for sale (NIB) in that range at a local shop. It is 110K. These guns are all better buys than even Baikal MP153 which in its own price category (50-55K) is the best buy, but I think u can get many options if budget is around 100K. I hope that helps.', ''),

Samad used to make 4 man boats earlier for consumer segment but now they have stopped its production like waders and duck decoys have been stopped too. Those 4-man (5HP to 15HP OBM fittable) boats were really good and I have used one on few recreation trips and two duck shoots ; that boat with its high speed trailer and a 5HP OBM is owned by a friend. Now he is offering the same for sale to hunters, fishing enthusiasts and/or recreation lovers, as he has left boating because of involvement in his new business.

Have followed it except the odd getting away times, which are very rare. [B]So now, i only smoke while i am travelling or on holidays[/B]. [B]Smoke in narowal but not in lahore. In Lahore, only smoke during rain, on eid, Close friends/family Bday parties, close friends/family weddings[/B]. \r\n[/I][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nLiked the  smoking in Lahore "[I]during rain[/I]" notion, lolzzzzzzz! And as for the [I]occasions[/I], well, really wonder what he left out from everyday''s life, lolzzzz!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, checked the preceding posts here and found out that though many of us do smoke, the desire to quit exists within everybody.\r\n\r\nSince I''ve not shared in this thread before - [I]whilst I was a smoker[/I] - let me kindly confide now:\r\n\r\nI started smoking when I was[B] 20[/B]. A childhood friend I hadn''t seen for 10 years, suddenly was sitting next seat to me aboard an airliner! Course that was an occasion for great gup shup, lolz! He offered one from a pack of John Player Lotus and since then it''s been [B]20 a day[/B], at times even more. I''m, [B]42[/B] today, so you can start counting the cigarettes I''ve consumed!\r\n\r\nI quit now about 2 weeks ago, realizing that this poison was the major cause for recurrent throat/chest infections. Enough was enough. No [I]cutting down[/I], just a big [B]STOP[/B], and that''s it! \r\n\r\nI know, there are [I]fall backs[/I], like quitting for some time and getting back to the habit again, but not here with me! I''ll never touch this poison again, change my nick if you ever see me doing it again! [B]When the decision comes from the "inside", that''s the end[/B]!\r\n\r\nMy experience so far:\r\n\r\n1) In two weeks, I''ve realized what it means to breathe through the nose!! Had totally forgotten this part, was basically breathing through the mouth!\r\n\r\n2) My appetite is going wild, so I''ll have to take extra care, not to put on excess weight.\r\n\r\n3) Strange tastes have appeared, I never thought existed before! I.e, since past few years, my major source of liquids has been the 1.5 ltrs pet bottle of Pepsi, at times 2 bottles a day!!Why? Simply because I found water "tasteless". Ever since quitting the smoke, I''ve found my love for water again and love the taste of it!! Yes, water [B]does [/B]have a taste, just not in a smoker''s world!!\r\n\r\n4) I am no longer the last person in for dinner ( Being called in from the terasse/lawn, puffing a cigarette). I''m also not the first to leave the table any longer ( Out again for another post-dinner cigee)!\r\n\r\n5) I sleep much better, deeper and longer.\r\n\r\n6)[B] My child loves playing with me, and I don''t have to think about the smoke/odor from the cigarettes, harming him any longer[/B]!\r\n\r\n7) [B]My family is confident this way and happy about it[/B]. My wife offered me to go for the fruit flavored E-cigarette ([B]zero nicotine/tobacco/no combustion[/B]), when hanging out with friends, just to ensure that I do not get back to the habit again.\r\n\r\n8) I trust quitting today could mean a couple of more years at the other end of the road! Perhaps I could also enjoy my weapons, my absolute passions, for some longer time, and not have to ask my son/grandchildren one day:\r\n \r\n"[I]Boys, plz come and [I]rack up[/I] this gun for me[/I]", lolz!\r\n ( The effort it takes for an[I] exhausted[/I] old man!)\r\n\r\n9) Money saved from this smoke will be spent on [I]gunsmoke[/I]/ammo, lolz!\r\n\r\n[B][COLOR="lime"]I INVITE YOU ALL TO JOIN ME![/COLOR][/B], for a [COLOR="green"]GREENER[/COLOR] life!\r\n\r\n[B][I]Let''s become [I]smokeless[/I] friends, let''s smoke out our barrels only, coz they were the things meant for it[/I][/B]!\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\n[B]@VIK[/B]...........Bro, nice to see your efforts.

Haven''t yet introduced myself in the introduction thread... this one caught my attention first ;)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE]The objective of this thread is not to debate over the effectiveness (theoretical or empirical) of one caliber over the other but to know your personal reasons that made you decide to go either way. your reasons could be any, from purely cosmetics to bookish data. [/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nTo answer that:\r\n\r\n1. I like .45 ACP over all other calibers.\r\n\r\n2. The main reason for that is the ''mythic'' one. It is culturish to attach ''macho'' ideas with this caliber. Plus I''m a huge Pacino fan and can''t just get his service model in Heat out of my head. lol\r\n\r\n3. I am not new to guns as a fan but I have owned my first ever gun for only about a week or so. Like I said before, I have always been a die-hard fan of 1911s. Unfortunately, Kimber is not available in Pakistan. My father (God Bless his soul) used to own one when we were abroad. He sold it before re-settling inland. So I had to settle down for a Taurus PT1911, which is .45 ACP. I like the weight (aint got no problems with it... as a matter of fact I like the feel of heavier guns... I have shot Glocks and Walthers and really hate the plastic feel) and size (got no issue with CC cuz of my heavy built and the attire I adhere to (meaning clothing choices etc)) and I have no issue with fewer rounds in mag. I just can''t give up the feel of a .45 and the sound of it for higher capacity. And the recoil feels great. I have shot nine mills from a Glock many times and strangely enough I am not too good with that. Used to shoot my Dad''s Kimber and was always on target. I am outa practice for over a decade though... so gotta catch up on the shooting skills too.\r\n\r\nI do agree however that carrying more 9 mills has an advantage, and the penetration dynamics count too. But like I said, with the kind of culture I have been raised in, I have come to believe what they say: "nine mills are for XXXXXX... men carry 45s". lol\r\n\r\nAlso, the neighborhood I spent some of my childhood days in was notorious for thugs with nine mill Glocks. It has kinda put me off permanently as far as a nine mill goes.\r\n\r\nWith this first post, I would like to say Assalam O Alaykum everyone. Hopefully, I''ll get to know the community well enough in upcoming days of my sojourn at the pakguns. Rock on! :rockon:', ''),

(334856, 'The New Taurus 709 Slim Subcompact Review Salams,\n\nFor the past couple of months I have shifted my attention to subcompacts from compacts and full frame pistols for carry. My ideal conceal carry gun needs to have the primary quality of making me forget that I am actually carrying it. Over the past two years I tried carrying the Walther PP, Akdal Mini06, Canik Compact, Glock 26, Glock 19, PT 909, Cz Duty and Cz Rami but all made their presence felt while sitting down or driving. Holsters did help lessen the carry feeling and weight distribution but in turn made themselves felt.\n\nThen I found the newly launched PT 709 from Taurus''s [I]SLIM[/I] series. Holding this little pistol for the first time I was amazed at it''s slim profile and features. It''s is DA/SA, has a 3 inch barrel, holds 7+1 rounds and weighs around 540 grams. The sights are semi adjustable, there is loaded chamber indicator and an external key locking mechanism found on most Taurus pistols.\n\nPictures:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nAs you can see from the pics, this little gun is heavily influenced by Glocks. The take down is similar as found on Glocks and Taurus have incorporated a Glock like ''Safe Action'' trigger in the Slim. The safe action trigger, the firing pin block, the external safety and the key lock gives this little pistol an amazing [B]four [/B]safeties ! Ambidextrous thumb and finger placements are molded into the polymer frame, the trigger guard is extended and the grip is aggressively checkered to keep the pistol gripped firmly in your hands. \n\nThe mags are of good quality and load the 7 rounds without much fuss. They fit easy and drop free when loaded and partially when unloaded. The slide release (kinda hard) and sights (adjustable) are both average and nothing special.\n\nShooting the pistol for the first time took me by surprise as the single action trigger was insanely hard, so much so that I missed the 2x2 target altogether at 15 M. I have never shot such a hard single action trigger in my entire life. The double action pull was smooth at around 6 pounds, the S/A should have been around 4 ideally, instead it was around 14 pounds ! It took everyone at the range by surprise, the standard joke being a glass of orange juice and nuts being required after each trigger pull ;) \n\nThe trigger makes the gun useless for paper target shooting unless fixed to a more manageable pull. I tried shooting 4 targets with it to share with you guys but was so ashamed at the results that I did not take any pictures. I would normally say that I was having a bad shooting day but putting the Slim down after 5 shots I picked up my Glock 17 and shot a 97/100 at 15 M''s on the next target. I invited other shooters fire my pistol and share their opinions and everyone was hiding targets left right and center ;)  \n\nThe recoil is also above average and after a few shots you notice a carbon copy of the grip checkering on your hands. As for ammo realibility, around 300 rounds of all kinds of ammo were put though the gun it did not misfire or fail to eject at all. The gun was shooting rather low for me so I took out a screwdriver and began adjusting the sights only to find that the low profile adjustable sight was already adjusted as high it could go. The loaded chamber indicator works but at the same time is not really very visible, the safe action trigger safety works well. \n\nThis concludes the first part of the review, the second part and Cz Rami comparison will follow soon InshAllah.', ''),

(334890, 'DUCK SHOOTING in THE RAIN Intentionally I planed Duck Shooting in the rain at Chenab at 13 Dec, 2011. Around 10 years back that was in my exercise to shoot in rainy days. So, this season I enjoyed a lot once again.  Shot 18 ducks, 14 collected; 01 picked up by flying Kite and 3 were dropped in deep water&#8221;.\n\nI captured few pictures in the rain; due to shower my digital camera got malfunction and now hardly I recovered some out of captured pictures; all are in the rain so, result is not good.\n\nShort story is; in light shower at  4:45 am left the camp; 5:10. am we were at boat,  5:40.am dropped at sand bed in &#8220;Kiundar Hide&#8221;. The hide size was 3x4 ft: 02 guns were accommodated.\nGuide returned to boat far from hide. \n\nDecoys deployed till 6:00.am. Wind Direction was North to South, hide was South face, Decoys spread was 50% left, 50% right plus one Mojo. While all settlements the hide was under shower till 7:25. am. \n\nFirst flight of 07 Pintails appeared and deceived at exactly in front of the hide; shot 02; than till 7:45.am; I enjoyed very good movement of Pintails, Teals and Gadwalls. \nWe also missed few good flight within range; and all was happening in shower. \n\nAll appeared flights; even a single duck was flying at low altitude and due to good deployment of decoys +favorable wind direction; all ducks were approaching exactly to cleared landing zone in front of hide. \n\nAt 8:00.am I thought we have enough bag and enjoyed  a lot ; so; we happily returned back in heavy shower on our heads. \n\nI was dry with maintained body temperature due to my waterproof suiting; but my friend was feeling cold with happy face.; and that was the second reason to leave the hide; even with good movement.\n\nMy experience always is; "No Shooting in the rain is wrong concept"; you can enjoy good shooting even in the rain if you have good survey and field information''\n\nAnd there is one an educational question; what&#8217;s the logical reason why Ducks are not flying in rainy or heavy cloudy weather & and we can''t see high flights of the Ducks in game water zones?\n\n[URL=http://img404.imageshack.us/i/dscf0013us.jpg/][IMG]http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9797/dscf0013us.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img19.imageshack.us/i/dscf0014qa.jpg/][IMG]http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/9251/dscf0014qa.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img837.imageshack.us/i/dscf0015x.jpg/][IMG]http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/957/dscf0015x.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img827.imageshack.us/i/dscf0018mf.jpg/][IMG]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6742/dscf0018mf.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img440.imageshack.us/i/dscf0019y.jpg/][IMG]http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/6051/dscf0019y.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img830.imageshack.us/i/dscf0020e.jpg/][IMG]http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/658/dscf0020e.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img534.imageshack.us/i/dscf0027fx.jpg/][IMG]http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/820/dscf0027fx.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img8.imageshack.us/i/dscf0026bd.jpg/][IMG]http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/4109/dscf0026bd.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img233.imageshack.us/i/dscf0025x.jpg/][IMG]http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/3523/dscf0025x.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n[URL=http://img217.imageshack.us/i/dscf0034m.jpg/][IMG]http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/4727/dscf0034m.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]\n\n[URL=http://img59.imageshack.us/i/dscf0037z.jpg/][IMG]http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/7269/dscf0037z.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nUploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]', ''),

It was originally designed for sub machine guns (MP5 and such) with silencers/suppressors.\n115 gr. & 124 gr. both fire at above the speed of sound, The 147 gr. was originally designed for as stated in the thread for a suppressed SMG, so the heavier bullet is loaded by most manufacturers to around 1,000 FPS which is less than the speed of sound - 1,120 fps approx. The extra weight of the bullet gives the bullet more mass to give it better penetration with less velocity.\nBullet weight has very little to do with accuracy for hand guns. however, the 115 will be flying faster so will have less drop. Each gun is different however and if you have adjustable sights, the quality of the cartridge and care that went into making the bullet and charge and brass will affect accuracy much more than the specific weight.', ''),

Red dot sights are meant for quick and parallax free target acquisition, they are usually meant for CQB and for assault rifles etc, usually they have an illuminated red dot which you can use with both eyes open, they are not meant for long ranges, however you can get magnifiers for some red dot sight, but still the magnification is not more than 3X.

(335002, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nas per my experience (which I humbly admit is no where near enough), a lighter/faster bullet offers maximum penetration (such as 115gr) and higher velocities and carries more energy per surface area but due to less weight and high penetration it lacks the ability of fully dumping its energy into the target.\r\n\r\nso, by increasing weight, we intentionally lower its velocity, lower its overall energy (consult kinetic energy formula please) but increase it energy dumping potential by lowering its penetration.\r\n\r\nanother thing one must consider, as the bullet''s velocity is lowered (through a given max-minima only) we increase an hollow points ability to expand successfully. bullets with higher velocities and lower weight often tend to not-expand or often do not expand as expected.\r\n\r\nme and AK47 bhai did a test a while back and found the same theory working. lighter and faster bullets (9mm hp of various makes) were not expanding whereas slower and heavier bullets (9mm hp of various makes) were expanding quiet successfully when passing through our improvised (flight retarding) targets.\r\n\r\nso, i''m thinking, a 124gr 9mm hollow point is as good as it gets. it gives good penetration, decent velocity and pretty good expansion.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(335064, 'Great Hunts By A Great Hunter Dear PG Friends,\r\n\r\nToday, I would like to share with you the story of successful hunts that I organized for one of my esteemed Swiss clients, Mr. Dieter Ochsenbein (pronounced as Ok-Sen-Bien) who shot a Sindh Ibex in Surjan conservancy (Jamshoro - Sindh) & a Himalayan Ibex in Khybar conservancy (Upper Gojal - Gilgit) during January 2011. I & my son Zargham feel greatly honored to have served this man of incomparable determination, will power, persistence and professionalism.\r\n\r\nMr. Ochsenbein is the Founder & President of the world''s largest taxidermy facility called Highveld Taxidermy in South Africa. He has been rated as one of the best hunters of the world by some of the world''s leading hunting organizations.\r\n\r\nHe is the recipient of SCI''s President Award which is considered as the most prestigious hunting award in the world, he has also received Africa''s highest hunting award called - Musgrave Award, he has also earned the PHASA Wildlife Utilization Award, he is also the recipient of the SCI''s highest hunting award called McElroy Award and he has also gained another prestigious award called Coenrad Vermark Award .... no mention of several other honorable mentions, acknowledgements and certifications.\r\n\r\nBrothers, when we hear of such hunting awards, I wonder if my hunter friends at Pak Guns can envisage the professionalism, dedication, persistence, hard work and fiscal investment required to gain such prestigious awards, especially, when the never ending competition is among dozens of millions of experienced hunters who are already registered with such international hunting organizations & clubs. \r\n\r\nMr. Ochsenbein is 65 years old. Unfortunately, he has been suffering from a permanent disability in shape of acute and unbearable pain in both his knees which were broken a few years back when he fell from a high mountain and landed flat on both his knees with a 45 kg load in his rucksack. Both his knees were shattered into fragments whereas his thigh bones pierced through his pelvic bones and landed in his belly. Despite several surgical operations, stitching his flesh & bones, inserting steel rods & drilling several screws in his broken bones, the surgeons could not fix them because his bones were literally shattered into fragments. \r\n\r\nWhile the doctors prescribed him not to stress his legs and stay on wheel chair, Mr. Ochsenbein decided to fight against all the odds, threw away his crutches, stood on his legs and started walking once again ... and guess what ... with his strong will and determination he resumed his long awaited passion of big game mountain hunting !!!\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Ochsenbein has to take strong doses of pain killers and when he walks a bit longer or exerts more stress on his knees, he needs to inject pain killer to reduce unbearable pain. At times, his knees gets swollen to such an extent that he needs to cut his trousers with scissors to enable easier circulation of blood through his legs.\r\n\r\nWhile bearing such extreme physical disability and pain beyond description, we wonder how did this SUPERMAN manage to climb the high mountains of the Karakorums in upper Hunza and shoot the Himalayan Ibex ???? which is considered as one of the most difficult animal to hunt in the whole world ! \r\n\r\nAfter having read this story, I''m sure my friends at Pak Guns will now understand the worth of all the great awards that Mr. Ochsenbein has won in his life &#8230; obviously, these prestigious organizations are neither influenced by "sifarish" nor do they believe in trade unionism &#8230; not to mention nepotism ! \r\n\r\nI & my team at Pakistan Guides salute this man of strong determination & will power and I am thankful to him for teaching me great virtues of life that I never knew before. And last but not the least, Mr. Ochsenbein has also taught me to bear hardships, pain & sufferings to accomplish one''s passion for outdoors and hunting ... in lieu thereof, I now bear totally new definitions and concepts ! \r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nKaiser Khan\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/photo_gallery/images/dieter_ochsenbein_sindh_ibex_L1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis beautiful Sindh Ibex was shot by Mr. Ochsenbein with his Blaser R-93 rifle (300 magnum) and Swarovski''s Z6 Scope from a distance of 320 meters. He always uses his hand filled cartridges and always takes back with him the used shells. \r\n\r\nMost of our hunters bring approx 100 to 200 cartridges for their big game hunting in Pakistan (@ approx 60 cartridges for each animal). Mr. Ochsenbein brought with him just 20 cartridges and used only two in Sindh & two in Gilgit, one to zero his rifle & the other to shoot his animals. His marksmanship & confidence literally amazed me. \r\n\r\nOther details of the hunt are as follows.\r\n\r\nRight Horn : 39 1/4 inches, Left Horn : 38 1/4", Ibex Height : 33" Length: 62 inches. By the way, this is the first Ibex in recorded history of trophy hunting in Pakistan which measures 62 inches in body length. Average body length of this animal is between 55 to 60.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://pakistanguides.com/hunting/photo_gallery/images/dieter_ochsenbein_himalayan_ibex_l1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis Himalayan Ibex was shot in the conservancy of Khybar in upper Gojal (Gilgit-Baltistan) from a distance of 375 meters using his hand filled 300mm mag cartridge in his Blaser R93 rifle. It snowed for three days so everyone had to stay inside the base camp. When the weather cleared, it was freezing cold (almost below 14 degrees celsius).\r\n\r\nOnce again ... Mr. Ochsenbein just used two cartridges, one to zero his rifle after such a long road travel and the other to drop this animal and he put the empty shell in his pocket to take it back home & refill it.  Never seen such a clean hunter who would never pollute the serene mountains with empty shells, whereas, most of hunters won''t even bother how many cartridges they fired. \r\n\r\nThe left horn of the trophy measured 39 1/2 inches & the right horn measure 38 3/4 inches. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_2012.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBefore coming to Pakistan, Mr. Ochsenbein hunted this Bezoer Ibex in Iran. It resembles very much with our Sindh Ibex but it has a bigger body and bigger horns. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_1985.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnd this is the Persian Urial he shot in Iran before coming to Pakistan.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_2149-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe happy hunter with my team led by PH Raja Naeem.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_2068.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_2130.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_2111.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis is the famous Attabad Lake which has been formed due to a huge landslide which totally blocked the Hunza river. Several villages, roads and bridges have been drowned under this lake. The maximum depth of this lake is 400 meters & its depth is inceasing daily due to incoming water. Currently, the people use these boats to travel accross this lake which is over 30 kilometers long, however, since the water is accumulating everyday, it''s length is also increasing daily, though by inches but it''s quite dangerous ... till the raw dam won''t be able to hold the pressure !\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_2115.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_2121.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/IMG_2131.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/DSC03739.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnd offcourse, I was also very happy to have served this great hunter who came to Pakistan with such physical constraints. Honestly, I thought, his hunting permits will go waste because of his physical disabilities and this would have been a great loss for my company. But this genuine hunter surprised me with his strong determination, hard work and persistence and ultimately proved that he deserved all those prestigeous international hunting awards conferred upon him by world''s most authentic hunting organizations.', ''),

(335070, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;174244]AoA Everybody\n\nas per my experience (which I humbly admit is no where near enough), a lighter/faster bullet offers maximum penetration (such as 115gr) and higher velocities and carries more energy per surface area but due to less weight and high penetration it lacks the ability of fully dumping its energy into the target.\n\nso, by increasing weight, we intentionally lower its velocity, lower its overall energy (consult kinetic energy formula please) but increase it energy dumping potential by lowering its penetration.\n\nanother thing one must consider, as the bullet''s velocity is lowered (through a given max-minima only) we increase an hollow points ability to expand successfully. bullets with higher velocities and lower weight often tend to not-expand or often do not expand as expected.\n\nme and AK47 bhai did a test a while back and found the same theory working. lighter and faster bullets (9mm hp of various makes) were not expanding whereas slower and heavier bullets (9mm hp of various makes) were expanding quiet successfully when passing through our improvised (flight retarding) targets.\n\nso, i''m thinking, a 124gr 9mm hollow point is as good as it gets. it gives good penetration, decent velocity and pretty good expansion.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nA very interesting experimentation and research by  Mr 12 Gauge. penetration and expansion are both a result of velocity and bullet weight. There are a lot of variables which have to been taken into account when Terminal Ballistics are discussed.\nIn a given caliber, bullets of a  given weight can only be driven to a certain safe maximum Velocity. I f we want to increase velocity we have to reduce bullet weight; if we want to increase bullet weight then we have to reduce velocity as the maximum safe pressure can not be increased above the given SAAMI value.\nIt is common knowledge that heavier projectiles with greater Sectional Densities plough deep into flesh and bones where as lighter bullets expand violently causing shallow wounds without penetrating deep into the vitals.\nThe expanding bullets like the Hollow points and the other types also depend on near max velocities to expand reliably; if they are lighter than optimum weight, these will expand but not penetrate deep enough, if these are heavy and do not have enough velocity these will penetrate but not expand. Reliable expansion, with deep penetration relative to the type of animal being hunted is a compromise achieved with careful research. Bullet making technology has progressed greatly in the last 30 years and it in itself is a vast subject. Much more on it later.', ''),

(335085, ' Excellent inputs by 12G bro and Skeeter Sir.\n\nYes, 12G bro and I conducted some nice tests in the presence of Dr. Zakir Sb and Moeen bro, with 6 layers of MDF boards as medium for gauging penetrations, of both 9mm Fmj''s and Jhp''s, as well as of cal .45 Fmj''s.\n\nThe results have been shown in separate thread below, but let me say, that my strange observation was that penetration/over penetration both are concepts which are kind of [I]exaggeratively[/I] discussed!\n\nWhen 115 gr [B]JHP''s[/B] would penetrate [B]6 layers[/B] of [B]MDF[/B] boards (Unfortunately, we did not have more, should have made the boxes of at least 8-9 layers, in order to confine and captivate the projectiles), I really doubt they would [I]not[/I] exit a human torso!! I mean, the hardness of 6 carefully placed layers of MDF boards, and with gaps between each, must be of somewhat a different [I]hardness consistency[/I] than flesh and bones!! Still the Armscor, Magtech, Prvi Partizan Jhp''s all exited all 6 layers!\n\nCheck thread:\n\n [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?5205-9mm-vs-.45ACP-Which-caliber-do-you-prefer-and-Why[/url]\n\n\n[I]I am of the opinion that max momentum transferred to a human target would be achieved by a slower velocity, the desired effect should be captivation/expansion within the body, so that the entire [I]force of delivery[/I] could stay contained in there and [I]irk[/I] the hit object, rather than just pierce through and take along with it the entire delivery of force/momentum for the wall/objects behind!![/I] This would ensure quicker "[B]knock down[/B]", causing [I]termination[/I] more due to [I]internal damages[/I] and [I]internal bleedin[/I]g, than the external "bleeding out" effect from penetrating higher velocity rounds..\n\nIMHO and in view of the tests performed, I found even the cal.45 ACP 230 grains Fmj velocity of some 850fps a bit too much for a human body!! We shot through a coconut, even the .45 Fmj just pierced through like a needle!! Perhaps the .45ACP JhP would have given me the desired effect upon the coconut, but unfortunately we did not have any along with us. May I add, the 124 Grained 9mm Jhp showed excellent results upon the coconut!!\n\nTo confine my opinion within the question by Chief, let me say, I''d prefer the 147 grainers for max momentum, if they would [I]just[/I] expand[I] reasonably[/I] well. I think velocity is still enough for a good expansion, this needs to be tested out, what say 12G bro? I also agree with 12G bro, that [B]124 grainers[/B] would give a good balance between power/recoil. This is all so variable, generally all these things carry along with them devastating effects, naturally.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Perhaps another quick read of my posted thread or maybe a deeper glance at the ''original topic'' could tell you a little more about the modality of my responsive perspectives.\n\nThe topic addressed personal choices: "which caliber do YOU prefer and WHY" irrespective of a valid scientific or statistical justification. And that is exactly what I did. And I have stated in which circumstances I have been brought up with the kind of used language and cultural infrastructure existent. And there is absolutely no indecency in stating so. \n\nBesides, I never said those words but quoted them and stated how I have come to be influenced by them. That makes me a victim of western brainwashing and cultural engineering at best, and not a lingual oppressor with decency short-comings.\n\nThere is no immaturity in the quoted cultural slang above. The effects drill down deeper. Perhaps a little research into the red-necked LA culture could reveal more information concerning the subject.\n\nFor the sake of clarity:\n\n"So in other words u r trying to say that all people who have 9mm are XXXXXX. "\n\nNo. I am trying to say that I have come to ''believe'' in those words as uttered by red-necks, and that I believe .45 is more "manly" than carrying a nine mill. That is solely my perception and solely my choice in belief. I am answerable to no one for it neither am required to explain it. You have a right to differ just as I have a right to hold this belief. Simple as that. The usage of the exact word referring to homosexuality was simply an indicative of, again, the culturish slang used in the context. That should explain to you in simplest possible manner the modality of my placed expression.\n\nSince I fear that you, sir, and not well-acquainted in socio-cultural studies, I should also mention here, by the way, that the quoted slang is not insulting or derogatory in the stated culture but is an expression of "friendly sparring". The expression does not disrespect the members of their society who own nine mills but simply puts the macho expression to the praise of the .45 owners. In ''other words'', the expression is simply stating that the .45 owners consider their caliber to be more macho than that of the nine mill.\n\nRegards dear sir.\n\nA quick hint though. Hurried judgement does not inspire people. ''Holier than thou'' attitude can only go that far.\n\nKind regards.', ''),

Sk2 will throw patterns out to 35 yards but also at the same time open up the pattern at lesser ranges of 20 yards too (which Mod choke will NOT), thats the advantage of that choke and hence called Skeet2 because skeet shooting is done at 22 yards to 35 yards ranges although max allowed shooting range from stations 1 & 7 is 44 yards. As Skeet1 opens pattern very effectively within 20-25 yards, first shot is perfect with it, while question of the second shot comes up....some shooters take the 2nd shot very quickly in no time (IC choke better) whereas some like to wait a bit (my style of shooting)(Sk2 choke better). Sk2 is also a v good overall choke to use on ducks (over decoys). Try to pattern Sk2 at 35 yards and Mod choke at same yards too (with #4 for ducks, as well as #8 for upland/partridge) ... total 4 shots and 4 paper sheets .. and see the difference to decide going for Sk2 or Mod?\r\n\r\nSecondly, #8 regular Shaheen 31-32 grams is the best cartridge among Shaheen for quail and #9 (25 grams) lead load is below in performance than that and very messy on the semi autos too. One reason is also the no of pellets which affects pattern density and density is very impt in quail shooting.\r\n\r\nSkeet1 choke is not the best first shot choke for either dove or partridge as you asked. IC is minimum recommended according to me, and follow up 2nd brl shot is best with again Sk2 and not any more choke because as I said earlier, Sk2 is pretty effective with dense and uniform enough patterns upto 35yds, and at partridge 20-35 yards is the usual distance including hunting in the salt range Punjab.\r\n\r\nSo for quail/duck over decoys/partridge/dove, my overall preferred selection would be IC/Sk2 and that combo I would like to master with these shells (#8 for quail and partridge AND #4 for ducks over dekes).\r\n\r\nRgds!', ''),

The Silver Tip HP, and Federal Hydra Shocks are 115 grains , the POF Mk 2Z is also 115 grains.\nMost pistols have 1 turn in 12 inches rifling; the CZs have 1 turn in 10 inches.\nThis sharper rifling twist of the CZs coincided with the adoption  of the 124 grain bullet by  the armed forces some 35 years ago.  This is one more reason for the pristine performance of the  CZ pistols.\nThe NATO trials for adoption of pistols stunned every one with what the CZ pistols could with stand.\nThe 147 grain is getting popularity these days because some how it is more accurate and gives better performance when silencers are used; the use is gaining more and more popularity in the special forces SubMachine Guns. \n The H&K MP 5 SD has perforated barrels shrouded with silencers to reduce the velocity of super sonic bullets to subsonic levels, (to allow use of Standard Military Issue Ammo) this reduces the Muzzle energy to about 250 ft lbs; severely reducing the killing power, but increasing the bullet weight to 147 grs  the ME is increased to acceptable  levels of about 310 ft lbs.\nThe reason behind the resurgence of the .45 ACP in the Militaries is again due to the fact that the .45 is subsonic at full power ie 230 gr bullets at 840 feet per sec give full power about 460 to 500 ft lbs, and can be completely silenced.\nThe earlier HP bullets would not expand at this  low velocity, but the modern HPs and Expanding Metal Jacketed Bullets are now giving excellent terminal expansion.\nThe energy transfer or the lack of it in a human target in case the 9mm pistol bullet passes through or stays inside is a bit over hyped; full penetration causes more lethal effects and it is deep penetration which kills faster than a shallow but larger wound channel. There are two blood letting holes and depending on the angle of strike and exit maximum damage is done to the vitals.\n The over penetration is a concern in aircraft bodies during an anti Hijacking scenario or a counter terrorist strike in a public area. more often than not there is heavy clothing which clogs up the HP bullets and these are known to have performed like FMJs with the exception of Hydra shoks and the EMJs.', ''),

(335232, ' One turn in 10 inches means the bullet completes a 360 degree revolution after traveling 10 inches. The Pistol barrels are short 3 to 5 or so inches but since there is no resistance to the spinning ,the rate of spin once imparted continues and it keeps revolving at the rate of one complete revolution per 10 inches of travel.This causes Spin Stabilization without which the bullet will not be accurate and also unstable and may tumble and yaw in flight.\nOne can find out the spin rate from the net for each weapon and if not then a  good cleaning rod with a free spinning handle when fitted with a tight cleaning patch is pushed in the barrel with an index mark on the rod one can see how many inches of travel was required for one complete turn. This will work for a rifle but for a pistols short barrel it would be very difficult to accurately measure the length of travel required for a 360 degree turn as the barrel would finish before even half a turn and measuring of angles would be difficult and in accurate.', ''),

(335329, ' @Dr. Zakir I''m not saying we should not buy this pistol, I quite like it infact. It just needs some ''kinks'' sorted out. As far as the trigger pull getting better with time, that is a little strange but is almost always true for some pistols specially the CZ''s. Perhaps the 709 has the same issue. Either way, looking forward to shooting the gun as soon as the trigger is fixed.\n\n@Owais Double action means when you pull the trigger the hammer or striker moves back with the trigger pull and then releases, single action means the hammer or striker is already cocked (either manually or by racking the slide) and the trigger pull will then release it. Single action requires much less force as the only thing it does is release the cocked hammer, double action requires more force as it cocks the hammer and also releases it.\n\n@Sohail I really like it as well, the size and profile is unbeatable.  \n\n@Ak47 The Rami is an awesome gun, infact it is a over performer and does much more than is required from it. All I need from a gun the size of Rami/Slim is to shoot in 9 or 10 ring consistently at 10 M''s. I am willing to trade off decreased accuracy and more recoil for a slimmer (more carry-able) profile and less weight.\n\n@Aqleem Lolz I wish I get Valentines gifts like these, sadly those days are long gone ;)\n\n@S.Cheema & Mani Thanks\n\n@Survivalist Actually the trigger was not the issue with all the pieces, I just happened to get a bad trigger from the lot. The issue with Taurus or for that matter most sub $ 500 pistols is that *all* of them are different. No two pieces are the same, some will have a better slide to frame fit, some have a better single action, others a better double action, some shoot better. I.e two guns from the same lot will always be 5% to 15 % better / worse than each other. One reason SIG and HK''s charge a premium for their guns is because with them quality control is tighter resulting is consistent performance across the board. \n\nThe bad trigger was a little disappointing but this is one gun that I''m willing to spend some time and a little money on. Getting a trigger adjusted is not a big deal & costs less than Rs. 1000. We in Pakistan often don''t take advantage of the cheap gunsmithing talent available here. With expensive 100 k+ weapons one thinks perhaps not to take a risk but anything under that bracket is fair game for getting customized to your hearts content. \n\nThe functionality this gun gives me, nothing else I own does.

(335355, ' The finish of both guns is good, but the Rami wins in all categories across the board like:\n\n1). Accuracy (Rami is insanely more accurate, infact giving most full frame pistols a run for their money)\n2). Sights (Rami has Tru Dot / Tritium Sights)\n3). Grip (Rami has Rubber grips which are also wide giving a better grip on the gun).\n4). Recoil (Rami''s additional weight (200 grams more) better grips and double recoil spring give it much softer recoil)\n5). Capacity (Rami holds 10 or 14 rounds to Slim''s 7)\n6). Firing System (I always rate hammer fired pistols over striker fired ones)\n7). Trigger (Rami has a much better DA/SA trigger)\n8). Heritage (Rami is a CZ, do I need to say more)\n\nThe Slim on the other hand has a few points over the Rami:\n\n1). Safeties (Slim has 4 vs Rami''s 1 (only firing pin block), decocker doesn''t count)\n2). Take Down (Slim is much easier to disassemble than the Rami. Took me 5 secs to disassemble the Slim vs 30 secs for the Rami) \n3). Weight (Slim is lighter than the Rami which weighs as much as full frame Glock 17!)\n4). Profile (Slim has a well... Slim profile making it much easier to carry)\n5). Snag (The Slim is a really snag free pistol, will explain more below)\n6). Ease of Carry (The Slim wins)\n7). Price (1xRami = 2x709''s)\n\nIt was obvious the Rami is a much better gun, but I tried to put it to my own little test which has more marks for me than any other. I should forget that I am carrying the gun. To test it out I was leaving for Islamabad a few days back and I took both guns with me. I put the Rami in my jeans pocket and started the drive to Isb, every 5 mins I would fidget and adjust the pistol, looking down I could see the pistol outline clearly through the fabric. The metal gun also felt cold and heavy. After about 30 mins I just got tired, took it from my pocket and placed it in my car. \n \nOn the way back, I put the Slim in my jeans pocket and within 10 minutes I had forgotten that I was carrying. Infact when I reached Lahore, had tea and gup shup for two hours, then a family member asked me if I bought anything new, I responded by saying yes I did and it''s in my car. Then I remembered that I had put the Slim in my pocket when leaving Isb, patted my jeans and there it was ! That is what I call a carry gun, it was in my pocket for 5+ hours and I completely forgot about it.\n\nI should also say that removing the Rami from one''s pocket and removing the Slim from one''s pocket are two very different experiences. The Rami''s slide rail edges get stuck in fabric, the sights as you can see from the pictures above are quite high profile and get stuck routinely, the dovetail grip also sticks and so does the magazine butt plate.  The Slim is another matter, everything that I outlined causing a hindrance to drawing the gun is not there, look at the 2nd and 4th pictures from the top and compare. Doing a little gun withdraw from pocket test, I could pull the Slim out in under 2 secs while the Rami took around 5 secs. \n\n[U][B]Conclusion:[/B][/U]\n\nThe Rami is the better gun but the Slim is good alternative in a much more economical budget. The trigger issues if present can be fixed by spending Rs. 1000 which can be counted towards the cost of the gun.\n\nFor me forgetting I am carrying is the most important thing. If the gun is reliable enough, 7+1 rounds of 9mm hollow points are enough to take care of any business.', ''),

I would like people to take from the illustrations I provided to avoid 115 gr and choose 124 or 147.  Also, some "unscientific testing" at someone''s private property might be able to illustrate the penetration differences between 115 and 147 of the PRVI or other readily available ammunition.\n \nDifferent ammunition performs differently when first striking an interior wall and then soft tissue.  The same is true of first striking automobile glass and then soft tissue.\n \nThere has been moderate and informal testing, for illustrative purposes, of various calibers and ammunition combinations from a variety of handguns, rifles and shotguns here:  [URL]http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/theboxotruth.htm[/URL]\n \nEven if you can''t manage to get Winchester or Speer commercial ammunition you can still enjoy the benefits of comparing those manufacturers against Wolf, Brown Bear or Norinco 115 gr FMJ or their less-than-adequate attempts at "JHP" (which appears to be a simple hole drilled in a FMJ bullet and zero expansion when it impacts anything.', ''),

Secondly brother its quite a simple question that you have asked, but the answer is very difficult. In Pakistan we cannot be sure of the availability of a certain rifle in any location. You really have to look around and with enough patience and effort you can find a good deal. I personally have seen many rifles in excellent condition that also falls within you budget. What I can do is look around in the Pindi/Isb area and see what is available here. \n\nAs for which rifle, there are many brands available here with various calibers, comes down to your personal preference. If I were you, I would ask the best two people for favour and take their suggestions as to how you can go around and make your own rifle in 7.62X54 caliber. You can have excellent barrels and triggers and sights with it, plus the ammo is also easily available. The members are Skeeter sir and Gillani bhai. Actually Skeeter sir is the pioneer in making these rifles in Pakistan. I can assure you that if you go with this setup it will last you a long time and you will never regret it or want to replace it.', ''),

How can you say, both are same?\n\nHowever, at 25 mtrs, the 92fs proves better perhaps, as per your charts, course barrel is longer than that of the CZ 999.\n\nMay I add, both are fantastic weapons. I personally have been impressed each time 12G bro and I have used his CZ999 customized [I]wonder-machine[/I] of a combat handgun, giving the most consistent shot patterns I''ve ever seen, always kind of makes[I] ragged holes[/I] on the paper, like it happened yesterday, when we were out in the field together again, check below pics and vids:\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/CZ999RaggedHole.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAnd from 15 mtrs, on another occasion, past session:\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Shooting021Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThese ragged patterns like above, forced me yesterday to finally make an official statement in the presence of 12G bro and Rotorcraft, that I may, sooner or later, have to avail this handgun for the pleasure of such shots, a gun that I have always [I]adored[/I], yet kind of [I]ignored[/I], perhaps because of it''s "Sanju Baba" kind of [I]ruggedness[/I], not so  very refined appearance. Yet, out of the muzzle, this gun performs absolutely up to the marks each and every time.\n\n[I]I am of the opinion - as far as comparison of the CZ999 and 92fs/ PT 99 is concerned - that up to 15 or 20 mtrs, the CZ 999 will always place [B]closer groups[/B] than the 92fs/ PT 99, which again will cover up from 15 mtrs onwards, due to the longer barrel.[/I]\n\nAnd some vids from yesterday''s session, 12G bro blasting a gallon of water with his popular CZ 999 customized "[I]Sanju Baba[/I]", lolz! Plz note 12G bro''s action after each shot, he kind of rests for a while, before bringing the gun up again for another shot, and yet, despite of this, shots from the CZ999 landing in almost same hole!!

(335649, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nYesterday was a public holiday and I was kinda bored. called AK47 Bhai and he immediately invited me to a cherry popping ceremony of Armscor Viper 9mm handgun. my opinion after firing a couple of rounds (target paper and water bottles) are as follows:\r\n\r\n[B]What I liked:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. its a good looking handgun. looks very modern and stylish\r\n\r\n2. the grip is slim and sufficient. the grip angle is also very nice. pointability is very good.\r\n\r\n3. mags are of good quality. insertion is smooth and mags drop freely.\r\n\r\n4. sights are great\r\n\r\n5. handgun has a very slim profile which should greatly aid in concealing.\r\n\r\n6. zero malfunctions whatsoever. the gun chewed in a variety of ammo from different manufacturers.\r\n\r\n[B]Things that I did not like:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. build quality is not impressive. the slide to frame fit is decent but one can practically feel both grinding against each other.\r\n\r\n2. Trigger is absolutely horrible out of the box. there is pre-travel, then over travel and then there is post travel. not to mention that it is gritty with plenty of creep\r\n\r\n3. the handgun feels out of balance. too much nose heavy.\r\n\r\n4. too much barrel play. the barrel when in lock position moves. you can easily move the barrel with you finger when the slide is fully forward on the rail. this was a major turn off. a tighter lockup ensures accuracy.\r\n\r\n5. the barrel is not internally hard chromed whereas from the outside it is. I wonder why? \r\n\r\n6. the rifling was very unimpressive. very shallow groves. I would always be more comfortable with a barrel which has deep rifling. and NO! the rifling was not polygonal :)\r\n\r\n7. recoil was sharp and snappy. not at all to my liking. there were three of us firing that handgun and everyone of them noticed higher recoil (one may call it perceived recoil if one wants to spin this information around a bit)\r\n\r\n8. the slimmer profile of the grip was causing discomfort in shooting the handgun. I guess smaller area touching the hand is to blame here.\r\n\r\n9. comparatively the handgun was getting alot of fouling. similar make and same number of rounds were fired from other guns but they were alot cleaner in the end. this one felt like it came out of a coal mine.\r\n\r\n10. there were no proof marks stamped on the gun anywhere. I always advise against buying handguns that are not proof marked. a manufacturer''s word isnt enough in my books. there should be some third party institution to validate the results.\r\n\r\n11. accuracy was only marginal. unimpressive at best.\r\n\r\nVerdict: (In my humble opinion, your mileage may vary)\r\n\r\n[B]"save your money and get something else."plenty of good handguns available in the market in this price range.[/B]\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(335663, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;174844]AoA Everybody\n\nYesterday was a public holiday and I was kinda bored. called AK47 Bhai and he immediately invited me to a cherry popping ceremony of Armscor Viper 9mm handgun. my opinion after firing a couple of rounds (target paper and water bottles) are as follows:\n\n[B]What I liked:[/B]\n\n1. [B]its a good looking handgun. looks very modern and stylish[/B]\n\n2. the grip is slim and sufficient. the grip angle is also very nice. pointability is very good.\n\n3. mags are of good quality. insertion is smooth and mags drop freely.\n\n4. sights are great\n\n5. handgun has a very slim profile which should greatly aid in concealing.\n\n6. [B]zero malfunctions whatsoever. the gun chewed in a variety of ammo from different manufacturers.[/B]\n\n[B]Things that I did not like:[/B]\n\n1. build quality is not impressive. the slide to frame fit is decent but one can practically feel both grinding against each other.\n\n2.[B] Trigger is absolutely horrible out of the box. there is pre-travel, then over travel and then there is post travel. not to mention that it is gritty with plenty of creep[/B]\n\n3. [B]the handgun feels out of balance. too much nose heavy[/B].\n\n4. too much barrel play. the barrel when in lock position moves. you can easily move the barrel with you finger when the slide is fully forward on the rail. this was a major turn off. a tighter lockup ensures accuracy.\n\n5. the barrel is not internally hard chromed whereas from the outside it is. I wonder why? \n\n6. the rifling was very unimpressive. very shallow groves. I would always be more comfortable with a barrel which has deep rifling. and NO! the rifling was not polygonal :)\n\n7. recoil was sharp and snappy. not at all to my liking. there were three of us firing that handgun and everyone of them noticed higher recoil (one may call it perceived recoil if one wants to spin this information around a bit)\n\n8. the slimmer profile of the grip was causing discomfort in shooting the handgun. I guess smaller area touching the hand is to blame here.\n\n9. comparatively the handgun was getting alot of fouling. similar make and same number of rounds were fired from other guns but they were alot cleaner in the end. this one felt like it came out of a coal mine.\n\n10. there were no proof marks stamped on the gun anywhere. I always advise against buying handguns that are not proof marked. a manufacturer''s word isnt enough in my books. there should be some third party institution to validate the results.\n\n11. [B]accuracy was only marginal. unimpressive at best[/B].\n\nVerdict: (In my humble opinion, your mileage may vary)\n\n[B]"[B]save your money and get something else[/B]."plenty of good handguns available in the market in this price range.[/B]\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nAgreed on all highlighted above. As for the rest, a very unbiased review given in by 12G bro, who for sure noted much more about the gun than I did, with respect to the more technical aspects of it, the genuine and competent reviewer that he is.\n\nI must say, I had looked greatly forward to this cherry popping event, ever since my younger brother had availed this handgun and invited me over to do a first hand review. 12G bro''s call yesterday for breaking the boredom out of a holiday, triggered me to make it the day for this event. Rotorcraft bro also accompanied us.\n\nBelow some pics to share:\n\n\n[B]The MAPP1 Viper, compact[/B]:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/MAPP1VIPERSmall.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/VIPER2Small.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/Viper3Small.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe guns used yesterday: CZ Rami/Viper/CZ-999\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/RamiViperScorpioSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/RangeSmall-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe target chart, distance SD, 10 yards.\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/ViperChartSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B][I]Conclusion[/I][/B]:\n\nI am of the view, that this is a handsome gun indeed, but for the already seasoned enthusiasts, with all the essentials in handguns at hand, already. The [I]novice/newcomer[/I] may not really enjoy it, the way he''d a CZ 999, Baikal Viking, Stoeger Cougar.\n\nOn the technical part of it, I personally shot very low with it, yet did not change the POA, which I tried my best to keep still at sub 6''o clock position, for the bullseye attempt. As a shooter, I may no doubts have a long way to go, still, yet this was a disappointing affair. 12G bro placed his shots better but above the bull.\n\nThe CZ-75 platform handguns, humbly, are better off when constructed in full steel/alloy. Polymer, somehow, just doesn''t go with this brand, it''s as simple as that. Comparatively, I have used the steel/alloy model Sarsilmaz [B]Kilinc 2000L[/B], which is a [B]much[/B] better handgun in all aspects, and which even Gilani sb passed out with full credits, when he was here with me.\n\nI found the take down pin of the Viper awkwardly easy in pulling out of the gun, for a field strip! It literally "jumped" out of the gun, when I held the slide back and pushed the pin lightly with one finger! Quite an ordeal to field-strip the Rami, comparatively, again proving that the[I] steeled[/I] pin doesn''t go well with the [I]polymer[/I] frame!\n\nI am pretty much sure the [B]Bernadelli/B6[/B] clone would perform on the same lines as of the MAPP1 Viper. This gun has all it''s visual charms, yet less of the practical impact.\n\n[I] Bottomline[/I]: [I][B]CZ was born in steel, has to be cloned in same, humbly[/B][/I].\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

I hv used all excpt Alum boats, and hv found that such rugged inflatables have an advantage of going through very shallow water without stuck keel. I have extensively used both. But when u want to use the boat to go into koondar blinds, then pointed fibergls or alum ones hv advantage. But for general river shooting in currents where one has to rackie up and downstream and go against currents (sometimes v strong ones) to sandbars and blinds, nothing beats the stability and ease of use of an inflatable dinghy (with hard floor and 5hp or plus obm rating sturdy wooden boards at back). I am not mentioning the usual inflatable types that can b fitted with small gasoline obms like coleman or sevylor super caravelles or sevylor fishhunters.

It''s just about the quickest [I]cross-draw[/I] you could have, with the grip of the gun pointing out from your body, at hands reach.\r\n\r\nThe holster above was made by a local guy, whom I helped with all the designing. The material is artificial leather, but I prefer it, since it doesn''t stain in humid weather.\r\n\r\nThe color was deliberately chosen for "[I]party wear[/I]", in that the neutral nuance of [I]off-white[/I] somehow is not as remarkably noted with jacket/coat off, as a darker nuance. The inside was lined with the softest cotton flannel in the market, beneath which there''s a thin layer of foam, to take good care of the gun.\r\n\r\nI did not ask for extra mag pockets, since they tend to [I]stick[/I] uncomfortably against the body. Instead the [I]pocket[/I] made can be used for free bullets, causing less of "print" against the body. May I say, for civilian use, a single mag even is enough for most circumstances. The option still exists to add one mag pocket on top of the pocket, and I may ask him to do it, yet it''s the [I]bulk[/I] I fear, this holster is not [I]felt[/I] at all, while carrying the Rami.\r\n\r\nTotal cost for holster and shoulder rigs accrued to some [B]Rs. 1500[/B] (Holster+rigs)!! The maker, however, made it clear that shoulder rigs and holster in future would not be for any less than [B]Rs[/B].[B] 2000-2200[/B], this first piece being a sample only!! I agreed, I find it fair, still, for holster +rigs, coz I noted that indeed it''s quite a time-consuming job to make the shoulder rigs, the way that I like them!\r\n\r\nAnd[I] [B]upcoming[/B][/I] project:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/My%20Guns/Holsters/NEXTPROJECT.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis time around, genuine leather, suede inner. I shall, however, ask the maker to line it further with some protective layer as to avoid staining from leather fats. The piece has been cut in accordance to size of above Rami holster. Let''s see, what I manage for this time as well.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoyed!\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards. :)', ''),

As per my experience, it is difficult to conceal any double stack magazine handgun. That is the reason I always preferred a Makarov when I genuinely wanted to conceal a gun. But a poor trigger and below standard accuracy are serious observations against 709 and can not be taken lightly. In my view, the only good quality genuine 9x19 CC handgun which is also very accurate and reliable with a smooth double action trigger is Kahr MK9 or even K9. But its not available in Pakistan (I am talking of Made in USA Kahr). \n\nRegarding comparison between Makarov and 709, 709 wins in weight (ease of carriage) and sights. In all other aspects, Makarov win hands down, just no comparison between the two, IMHO.', ''),

Information is available over the internet.  \n \nIt offers what a polymer compact can best deliver. The pre travel post travel thing is in all triggers (non customized) and the trigger on my gun is just fine, I have not found anything wrong at all, its light and feels very good. A slight barrel wiggle, up on the muzzle when pushed hard and vigorously is present nearly on most semi-autos and its also normal for a pistol. Go figure it out on your CZ999 cant say about RAMI as havent experienced myself. Well about the fouling of gun mentioned, you should also know what the gun was dipped into before shooting as its no suspense now :)\n \nBros gun we are talking here is a combat type not a match pistol and I would appreciate as well if you add your targets for reference and comparison purpose only :) with two of other guns you have shown in the post.

This is by no means any attempt to degrade the Viper, no, not at all, just a genuine[I] comparison[/I] review.\n\nMy brother phoned me today about our review, and I told him: " look, the gun''s alright for you, it''s meant for SD, and any gun that fires well and reliably enough, is a good gun for SD, when used from traditional SD distances, and within the scope of a combat handgun. Our reviews on PG are [I]beyond[/I] the SD purpose itself, in that we compare to other options as well". He was satisfied. And it may work well for him, as it may for you as well, or for any other enthusiast wishing to have this beautifully finished handgun.\n\nFurthermore, let me say, it''s an almost inarguable fact, that polymer framed guns will never have the same balance or accuracy as those in steel/alloy. If ever a Glock even, was manufactured in all steel, I''d love to see it''s review against the same in polymer! Hence, my [I]bottomline[/I] above on the CZ''s and my comparison of the Viper to the Sarsilmaz Kilinc 2000L and steeled/alloyed Cz''s/Cz clones in general. These were my major points. \n\nThe targets that you require, well, unfortunately we had only two target charts with us on this specific day, and they both got mixed up by shooting from all the guns. We noted the results, as we proceeded with the different guns. The CZ 999 shot as per this target, the round circled area:\n\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/PG%20upload/CZ999RaggedHole.jpg[/IMG]\n\nRemaining shots were from the Viper.\n\nRami shots, in my separate review:\n\n[url]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/RamiChartSmall.jpg[/url]\n\nMay I add again, this review is by no way any attempt to degrade the Viper as a combat handgun, and I''m sorry, if this has been felt as so. The Viper has since long been one of the guns that I''ve been attracted to, and it''s a nice gun as such in the 50K range. As regards my criticism above, I''m willing to accept the opinion of any of our most seniors, with respect to polymer Cz''s/Cz clones vs steeled/alloyed ones.\n\nRegards.', ''),

There are other models too, but this one is the better buy. Other features that I think are worth noting are:\r\n- RECOIL & ALL LOADS CYLCING: (quoting from page!) The self-adjusting Active Valve gas system reduces recoil significantly more than recoil-operated systems and a proprietary next generation Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad is fitted to further increase shooting comfort. \r\n- 4 cartridge magazine\r\n- Gun surfaces are enhance for corrosion resistance\r\n- Weight is very good at 6-3/4 lbs in 28" barrel which is the same as A400 Xplor Unico by Beretta (28" brl / NON kickoff)\r\n- Overbored barrel and extended flush chokes called Invector Plus like Beretta Optimas/Optima Plus/Optima Plus HP choke systems except that the bore dia is 0.742" which is more overbored than Beretta OPT 0.732" or Browning Maxus Invec Plus 0.740"\r\n- The stock length spacers are there but I did not find the stock cast adjustment shims there in manual .. Berettas have that .. u can confirm though.\r\n \r\nOverall, always ask users of the gun before trying or purchasing, because we have to weigh the guns after 6 or 8 rapid Shaheen cartridge boxes (which are messy and dirtier than imported ones but very efficient at same time as we know) are fired in humid or cold and wet conditions like duck hunting or other, and then see whether the gun fires fluidly without fail. And repeatedly that same exercise has to be put to test to determine the semiauto gun''s function and robustness. In my personal view, there is no other way. I have used Beretta A303, A304, Remington 1100, Remington 11-87 and AL391 Teknys extensively on hunting and limited use at clay (skeet & trap) ... functioning without jam or without slowing down in heavy field use is really important to me. In my opinion Beretta A303, A390, AL391, Browning Maxus semi autos take the lead in hunting semis espec with reg to our conditions (shell problems and other), but my fav has always been A303, better than the newer A400, Urikas & Teknys''s etc, bec of many reasons, the only care with the great A303 model is to avoid super and excel Shaheen cartridges usage which I personally do not like too due to primer and mnfc variance problems.', ''),

(336060, ' @AK47, you are very correct bro to mention the difference of polymer and steel/alloy framed gun, the difference of their feel and balance. It is normal. All metal guns are sweet shooters in contrast to polymer. That is what I said MAPP1 delivers what you would expect from a polymer pistol. Polymer variants should not be directly compared to steel variants as such.\n \nSir, being honest here I shoot very less often due to various reasons, and I am not a very skilled shooter at all. Although firearms and shooting is my top hobby and passion. With current skill level, Ive tried two different CZ999s and a Baikal. I was able of similar performance on both.... restriction being my shooting skill. All these platforms are good and affordable performers.\n \nThere are no such hard and fast rules of good shooting but the practice alone. Point of impacts, group sizes etc dramatically change when we get used to a specific gun, or have increased our operating hours on a specific gun automatically.\n \nSome guns are more user friendly and adaptable than others. Firer''s personal matter of choice and compatibility therefore comes into play here. I checked your targets. I found both pictures have same target which was first shot by Viper and then later on with CZ999. Frankly it is visible that performance difference is 18/20 which ofcourse is due to Viper being a new gun in hands and CZ999 already have gone through a couple of operating hours in 12G''s hands. Still the Vipers results are very close. Please understand that shots which appear as flyers and which break the grouping all of a sudden are shooter''s fault always, hope you get the idea as gun''s barrel wont flip or turn as such.\n \nYou like all metal guns you should go for them. Actually most shooters prefer metal over plastic for the classic feel of shooting and I agree with that you should have mentioned it too. I am still on the feeling that the Viper you acquired has certainly something wrong with it, like too much barrel play especially and it sounds like a serious lemon to me.', ''),

(336073, ' @Gilani Sahib Thank you. \n\nA friend had graciously offered to tune the 709''s trigger for me and I got it back today for test firing. To avoid polishing etc, since we already liked the trigger in double action the simplest thing to do was to remove the single action entirely and make it DAO (Double action only). Getting the gun back, the double action was lovely, fired a few shots in the DAO mode but the gun started to FTF. It turned out that the converting it to DAO had reduced the firing pin strikes. i.e the primer was being stuck with less force. Ofcourse since the gun has second strike capability pulling the trigger again fired it but that is unacceptable. Now we''re reverting it back to the original SA/DA trigger with a slight trigger polishing.\n\nI must say although failing to fire sometimes, the DAO (lighter) trigger improved accuracy by leaps and bounds. The gun was easily shooting 2 inch groups at 15M. I might get the gun back tomorrow with the normal trigger and will try to post a target.', ''),

I suggest, if you&#8217;d agree with me, we do a review on these budget guns, in a[I] collective community effort[/I], by volunteering members, offering both handguns and required essential ammo.\n\nIf there&#8217;s any consensus on such an effort, venue and time can be discussed over here and an arrangement be made for both conducting the review, as well as for the short encounter -cum&#8211;lunch between the few participating members, yet again as a[I] collective[/I] [I]effort [/I]with the contribution between attending/ contributing members, so as not to burden a single member with all the hosting/arrangements.\n\nWe need:\n\n[B]4-5 handguns( Baikal MP446, Stoeger Cougar, CZ-999, Viper, etc)[/B]\n\n[B]100-150 9mm rounds approximately[/B]. ( Distributed over 4-5 handguns, 2-3 shooters of each class, proficient, intermediate, amateur) \n\n[B]8-12 target charts + Target Board, preferably a stand[/B].\n\n[B]Private venue[/B]\n\n[B]A Host[/B].\n\n[I][B]Any member from the Hazara Guns Club is welcome to offer his venue/services, since this region would be the most ideal to undertake the experiment in[/B][/I].\n\nAll 4 handguns to be fired from [B]3 classes of shooters[/B], [I]expert[/I]/[I]intermediate[/I]/[I]amateur[/I], coz we&#8217;re interested to know, how these guns would perform, not only in the hands of expert shooters, but also in the hands of an ordinary person with one of these for his SD requirement. \n\nMode of firing will be both deliberate fires, as to establish the accuracy of these handguns, and finally, shooting from max 10 yards SD distance in fast strings of 5, so as to judge the SD effectiveness in quick follow up shots/ speed-fires.\n\nTime can be discussed, yet I won''t be available personally before the week 7-14th March.

(336157, ' [QUOTE=Furrukh;175305][B]Tell me something AK bhai. In lay man terms, how does the construction of a gun, for example if its in steel or polymer effect the performance and accuracy[/B]. For example you said earlier that the B6 polymer was not very much stable....[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, not being a material scientist, I may not be able to reply this question in scientific terms, but my personal belief is that polymer, [I]no matter how hard and durable it is[/I], still would have a bit more "[I]elasticity[/I]", if I''m using the correct term, than steel. Hence during high pressure firing, there may be a tendency for the polymer walls to be kind of "giving in" to the pressure[I] a bit more than steel does[/I], which again would cause some moderate vibrations within the walls of the frame on which the slide is moving, causing slight to moderate accuracy aberrations. Bear in mind that even a slight deviation of direction of gun from the muzzle-end can mean quite a deviation in the point of impact of fired round, some 10-25 mtrs ahead!!\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in a polymer handgun, the polymer frame on which the steeled slide is moving, is given just a few steeled "contact points" on which the slide moves, whereas the rest of the movement back or fort of the slide is actually a piece of steel moving on plastic. This cannot be as [I]smooth[/I] as steel moving on steel. \r\n\r\nCourse, we''ve Glocks and certain Sig models of the high-end guns, which are absolutely top class polymer guns, but I''ve always said, I''d really have appreciated to have a version of these guns in all steel for a better comparison, I''m sure they would win hands down against the present polymer ones! In Sig guns, the comparison option exists, in Glocks, no.\r\n\r\nHow do you think a fat weightlifter with a robust, solid upper body, but thin and weaker legs, would be balancing the rod of load above head?? Can you imagine the [I]trembling[/I], even if he does manage lifting it overhead? Perhaps, this is the simplest example, I could give to you.\r\n\r\nThe polymer fashion was introduced simply because it''s cost saving as compared to steel manufactured handguns for the manufacturers, and in order to reduce the weight of the guns for modern days "[I]naazuk[/I]" men, who somehow are more comfortable with a couple of ounces lower in weight and can''t perceive that a man is best suited carrying rock solid steel! Kindly ignore my harsher examples, I repeat it''s my personal opinion, we''re allowed to differ, for sure.\r\n\r\nI''m not criticizing the B6 to the extent of rejecting it, no, not at all, it''s reportedly a nice gun, you still may be satisfied with. Generally, all these guns above are reliable guns, hence, unless you use some bad ammo, you can be sure of a successful shot each time you squeeze the trigger, as well as you can be sure that these guns would throw off the fired shell and load a new one. This is basically the reliability required from any SD handgun, and all above models inclusive of the B6 fulfill it well. Rest is expert talks, on the slighter deviations between one model and another, in one aspect or another, like weight, balance, accuracy, etc.\r\n\r\nHope to have been able to reply you in as simple terms as possible, and perhaps some of our more experienced members may be able to assist me with a better explanation even.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Zigana Sport\r\n\r\nOut of the 10 mentioned above I really fell in love with the last 2 based on their looks, finish, suitable grip, ease of handling and ideal barrel size. Now I know that the Viking, Couger and CZ 999 would be better firearms than my last 2 choices, but as far as I am concerned I have short-listed the B6 and Zigana and wanted experienced shooters like you just to pick one up for me between these 2.', ''),
(336186, ' [QUOTE=AK47;175316]Bro, not being a material scientist, I may not be able to reply this question in scientific terms, but my personal belief is that polymer, [I]no matter how hard and durable it is[/I], still would have a bit more "[I]elasticity[/I]", if I''m using the correct term, than steel. Hence during high pressure firing, there may be a tendency for the polymer walls to be kind of "giving in" to the pressure[I] a bit more than steel does[/I], which again would cause some moderate vibrations within the walls of the frame on which the slide is moving, causing slight to moderate accuracy aberrations. Bear in mind that even a slight deviation of direction of gun from the muzzle-end can mean quite a deviation in the point of impact of fired round, some 10-25 mtrs ahead!!\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in a polymer handgun, the polymer frame on which the steeled slide is moving, is given just a few steeled "contact points" on which the slide moves, whereas the rest of the movement back or fort of the slide is actually a piece of steel moving on plastic. This cannot be as [I]smooth[/I] as steel moving on steel. \r\n\r\nCourse, we''ve Glocks and certain Sig models of the high-end guns, which are absolutely top class polymer guns, but I''ve always said, I''d really have appreciated to have a version of these guns in all steel for a better comparison, I''m sure they would win hands down against the present polymer ones! In Sig guns, the comparison option exists, in Glocks, no.\r\n\r\nHow do you think a fat weightlifter with a robust, solid upper body, but thin and weaker legs, would be balancing the rod of load above head?? Can you imagine the [I]trembling[/I], even if he does manage lifting it overhead? Perhaps, this is the simplest example, I could give to you.\r\n\r\nThe polymer fashion was introduced simply because it''s cost saving as compared to steel manufactured handguns for the manufacturers, and in order to reduce the weight of the guns for modern days "[I]naazuk[/I]" men, who somehow are more comfortable with a couple of ounces lower in weight and can''t perceive that a man is best suited carrying rock solid steel! Kindly ignore my harsher examples, I repeat it''s my personal opinion, we''re allowed to differ, for sure.\r\n\r\nI''m not criticizing the B6 to the extent of rejecting it, no, not at all, it''s reportedly a nice gun, you still may be satisfied with. Generally, all these guns above are reliable guns, hence, unless you use some bad ammo, you can be sure of a successful shot each time you squeeze the trigger, as well as you can be sure that these guns would throw off the fired shell and load a new one. This is basically the reliability required from any SD handgun, and all above models inclusive of the B6 fulfill it well. Rest is expert talks, on the slighter deviations between one model and another, in one aspect or another, like weight, balance, accuracy, etc.\r\n\r\nHope to have been able to reply you in as simple terms as possible, and perhaps some of our more experienced members may be able to assist me with a better explanation even.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nAK bhai, you should have been in the field of research and development.

(336223, ' @12Gauge VIPER is the export name used by Armscor, and is named MAPP1 in their product line which in turn is a Tanfoglio/Armscor joint venture. All parts including the slide stop, safety switch, magazines, slide, barrel, etc are directly imported from Tanfoglio Italy. It is no doubt an Italian make. Made by Tanfoglio. Tanfoglio has joint business setups with Armscor, EAA, IMI and a few others as well. \n \nNow the two piece barrel thing you mentioned should not be a turn off for you. You must know that many bigger names make barrels in two pieces. It is a production line tactic reducing machining hours and make the process simpler and cost effective. Barrel is made in form of one long barrel and chambers are made separately which are then fused together. It is the way Tanfoglio make barrels. That is why Armscor gets the barrel that way. After all you know feed ramps and locking lugs are made separately as well and are welded to barrels we use in our pistols. This does not affect barrel''s life or accuracy. About proof marks, I would say it was ideal if they had it etched on the breech but they didnt. However, all VIPERS are fired with 32 proof rounds before they get out of factory as per manufacturer.\n \nUnless, as I mentioned to AK47 as well, his pistol has something wrong with it (lemon phenomenon), a slight wiggle on a bushing less barrel is normal and so is a little play in slide vs. frame, as these tolerances are built-in all combat pistols. On paper and theory, these would affect accuracy by a little margin. This "No such margins" are to be left which could possibly waste a shooters talent under a competition environment. In combat pistols these tolerances are made to settle grim/dust particles to ensure reliability. It is however more important for the barrel to retain its actual position shot after shot when the slide cycles. 92FS as an example design wiggles A LOT and still is accurate but under competitions same 92FS is fitted with compensators which also act as barrel stabilizers. Nose pieces are also used etc for the same purpose. Its rather good if your CZ999 lockup is very tight you should be happy for that, but a little wiggle as much as 0.5mm is perfectly normal too. \n \nYou have also mentioned muzzle heavy character. This is true for the VIPER. Some guns are muzzle heavy. Being heavy at muzzle also enables the pistol to be more stable to hold at the target, for follow up shots as well. \n \nOnce again about the excess fouling thing you mentioned in your review. Bro, I dont get this as you yourself mentioned that you used same brand/amounts of oil on all handguns and round count shot from each handgun was also same. I hope the ammo was also identical then ... where the fault lies? This is not a pistol''s attribute to get more fouling...you should be able to answer it instead but as far as I think, it is merely a matter of nothing. More fouling is actually a function of ammunition used.', ''),

I admit non-chrome lined barrels would last for up to 25K rounds standard. Chrome lined ones would go a bit higher depending on use and how long the lining stays in place.\n \n25K round limit says that, the accuracy and point of impact would remain constant up to this round count, beyond that a barrel may show change in POI or accuracy at any time and then this change is gradual with further usage accordingly.', ''),

(336327, 'Review: Baikal MP-27EM-1C &quot;Sporting&quot; [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nIn the world of shotgunning, there are hunting shotguns, designed specifically for field use. they are designed in a way that minimizes weight because after a good walk in the field even a 6.5 pounder gun feels like a ton.\r\n\r\nThen there are sporting shotguns. They are built, either from ground up or converted from a hunting platform, for sporting use. along with solid build, they offer certain features which aid in sporting use. the reason for a solid built gun is that a sporting shotgun has to withstand high volume shooting associated with typical shotgun related sports.\r\n\r\nWeight is usually of a lesser concern because the operator doesn''t have to carry it all day long. when the turn is up, he/she has to put it back on the stand. infact, more wight lessens recoil and makes the swing more smoother.\r\n\r\nMostly, sporting shotguns are expensive when compared to their hunting counterparts. almost all major shotgun manufacturers offer a sporting lineup along with typical hunting product line. Similarly, Baikal [B]MP-27-EM-1C "Sporting"[/B] is a shotgun offered by [B]"IZHEVSKY MEKHANICHESKY ZAVOD"[/B], for the shotgun related sporting activities. [B][I](Shotgun courtesy of Stigma)[/I][/B].\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP27-EM-1C%20Sporting/Image.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis gun is not a "built from the ground up" type shotgun rather its a regular Baikal hunting platform shotgun transformed into a sporting use shotgun by some pretty clever conversions and by offering certain features which are big plus in sporting use.\r\n\r\n[B]Specifications:[/B]\r\n\r\nChamber Length: 3 inches\r\nOver all Length: 47.5 mm or 1206mm or 120.6 cm\r\nBarrel Length: Two ported barrels of 29.5 inches or 750 mm length\r\nSights: Florescent Front bead and standard brass mid bead, front sight sucks. should have been a white (Ivory) sight (personal preference)\r\nTrigger: single trigger with clean break, slight pre-travel (standard) and no over travel, no creep (after cleaning)\r\nRib: Ventilated wide rib measuring 10mm in width\r\nWeight: 7.9 pounds. this particular piece came at around 7.7 pounds. weight usually varies from piece to piece due to wood density.\r\nLength of Pull: 14.5 inches or 368 mm\r\nDrop at Comb: 1.75 inches or 45 mm\r\nDrop at heel: 2.75 inches or 70 mm\r\nScrew in Chokes supplied: 3 (IC, M, F)\r\nTrigger Pull: 4.5 pounds (could be wrong cause i''m only using a spring scale) but to me, the trigger pull seems just about right.\r\nBalance Point: 2.5 inches ahead of the receiver or right under the forend screw.\r\n\r\n[I]Single Selective Trigger, Selective Ejectors (can be turned on or off ), Polished Nickel\r\nReceiver, Walnut Stock With Right Hand Palm Swell and Cast Off, Hand Cut Checkering, Competition Walnut Forend, Wide Vent Rib, Double Sight Beads, Deep Engraving, Hammer Forged Barrels, Precision Barrel Porting, 3 Screw-in Chokes.[/I]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP27-EM-1C%20Sporting/Image1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nopen the gun up, you''ll not only find that the shotgun features same internals as a hunting shotgun but is full of some of the nastiest and strangest stuff in the shotgun world. this ofcourse necessitates a through cleaning before we more forward with a full review.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP27-EM-1C%20Sporting/Image2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThere u go, everything all clean and SHINY.

Things I loved:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. wide rib\r\n2. trigger\r\n3. forend\r\n4. receiver finish\r\n5. checkering\r\n6. finish of the nickel receiver\r\n7. porting\r\n\r\n[B]2. Things I liked:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. barrel finish\r\n2. wood to metal finish\r\n3. furniture\r\n4. the design of the recoil pad\r\n5. balance\r\n6. weight\r\n7. good and clean construction of receiver and its internals\r\n\r\n[B]3. Things that I did not like:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. choke tube finish (another reason for me to recommend trulock chokes)\r\n2. hard opening and closing of the boxlock receiver. this is typical of all brand new Baikal shotguns.\r\n3. hardness of the safety switch. this is also typical of all brand new Baikal shotguns.\r\n4. rough and sharp metal edges here and there. Russian Finish, cant really complain right? ;)\r\n5. engraving: it is supposed to look like a clay bird in motion instead to me it looked like a flying UFO (saucer) or may be a Frisbee. a simple and elegant floral design would have been a lot nicer.\r\n\r\n[B]4. Things that I hated:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. front bead: it sucks, I''ll suggest either to get it replaced or paint it white\r\n2. the recoil pad finish: I dont know what to say about it. the design is good but the finish is so poor that one cannot look at it for more than two seconds. its presented in strange red color (looks brownish) which looks worn out and kinda cheapish.\r\n3. the internals had some of the nastiest stuff on the planet. all sorts of funny looking preservative along with wood and metal shavings were all over the place.\r\n4. the bottom choke tube was literally stuck. I had to use all my force (to a point that I got a good bowl movement afterwards) just to unscrew it out for cleaning. I was surprised to see that the threads were fine and clean and it was the preservative which jammed the choke in its thread. the company should have used some sort of antisieze/copper grease instead of regular preservative. regular preservatives are used only for rust protection and upto some extent lubrication. they are not designed for threaded applications and long term storage.\r\n\r\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\r\n\r\nBaikal MP-27-EM-1C "Sporting" offers everything that a sports oriented shotgun should and at a price that probably no other manufacturer can compete with. it not only offers excellent utility but it also offers some features that are present on high end shotguns priced many times more than this Russian Shot Spitting Beast. [B]if one wants to get the most out of their hard earned buck then Baikal MP-27-EM-1C "Sporting" is probably the best budget gun that money can buy[/B].\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]', ''),

A word to all who are looking into purchasing it, please do not pay more than Rs. 55,000 for this gun. \n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1). Fired the gun quite a bit, no ammo sensitivity at all.\n2). As with all sub $ 500 guns, one must check a few pieces before buying one. I sometimes mess up that bit because I start playing numerology like you with the serial numbers ;) \n3). The single action pull is better about a pounds or two lighter but still hard. Need to put more rounds though it. Will test it with Armscor hollow points next week if I get a chance.\n4). The red box is indeed the 311 that you are talking about. I call it ++p because it fires like .30 rather than 9mm. \n\nWill post a target shot at the range shortly.', ''),

(336473, ' [B]32ACP (7.65mm) [/B]\r\n\r\nDesigned by John Browning for his first successful automatic pistol, manufactured  by FN in belgium, and introduced in 1899. 32 ACP is one of the most popular pistol cartridges ever developed. Colt, Remington, Harrington & Richardson, S & W, and savage made pistols for this cartridgein the U.S. In Europe, every company that turned aout automatic pistols chambered the 32 ACP. It was also used in the German-made Pickert revolver. In Europe, it is known as the 7.65mm Browning. 32 ACP is a semi-rimmed cartridge that, because of its relatively low power, is unusually well suited to small, low-cost pistols. 32 ACP is about the minimum size that can be seriously considered for self-defence. It is used exclusively for pocket-type, or house-guns and is not considered adequate for police or military use. However, in Europe it is often used in police pistols and as an alternate but unofficial caliber for military siearms. Loading tables generally give the bullet diameter of the 32 ACP as .312-inch or .314-inch. It is actually closer to .308-inch, and this is important if you intend to handload it. Effectie small game loads can be made up by using 30-caliber rifle bullets of 100 grains weight, intended for light loads and plinking. The Speer 30-caliber "Plinker" in the 32 Auto gives improved stopping power and reliable functioning.', ''),

Torture test??? I am sorry as cost would be too high for the ammo/gun.\nRemaining all things feel, grip, weight, sights, balance, recoil and beauty are subjective things and would vary for the different shooters depending upon their taste, built, assumptions, expectations and prejudices.\nLast thing, budget guns have a great tendency of having variation in built quality and performance from gun to gun and batch to batch.

(336459, 'World handgun rounds 25 ( 6.35mm ) Automatic Pistol\r\n\r\nIntroduced in the United States in 1908 with the Browning-designed, Colt-manufactured, 25 Vest Pocket Automatic Pistol. It was introduced in Europe a few years earlier in the F.N. Baby Browning, which is practically identical to the Colt. The design of these two pistols has been copied by manufacturers all over the world and literally dozens of different pistols have used this cartridge. The original Browning is still made ( for European consumption ), but Colt did not resume manufature of their model after WWII. Beretta, Galesi, Astra, Star and others also make 25 automatic pistols. The 25 Automatic has fairly high elocity for such a amall cartridge. However, the energy it delivers at any range is quite low, and this, combinedwith the full-metal jacketed bullet, adds up to very poor stopping or killing poweron anything. The 22 Short rimfire with the hollowpoint bullet is a better killer and will infact a more serious wound than the 25 Auto. In fact, small semi-auto pistols chambered for the 22 Short rimfire cut sales of the 25 Auto for a time. The 22 Short is much cheaper, too. The 25 auto is not powerful enough for hunting anything but sparrows or rats, nor is it adequate for serious self defence. However, the 25 semi-auto pistols are popular because of their small size. Their principal usefullness is as a threat, because no one wants to get shot if it can be avoided, even with the little 25. The 25 Auto has one adantage over the 22 Short in that being a rimless case, it feeds and functions more reliably in automatic pistols.', ''),

(336463, ' [B]7.62mm Russian Tokarev[/B]\r\n\r\nThe official Russian pistol cartridge adopted in 1930 for the Tokarev Model TT-30and modified Model TT-33 automatic pistols. The pistols are a basic Browning-type design similar to the Colt 45 auto pistols. However, they incorporate many original features to simplify manufacturing processes and must be considered an advance over the original Browning patent. These pistols are often a little rough or crude in finish, but are well made and of excellent design. They have a 4 1/2-inch barrel and a magazine capacity of eight rounds. Moderate quantities hae been sold as military surplus. Some were made in China and Hungary, as well as in Russia. The Hungarian-made Tokarev, in a modified form called Tokagypt, is chambered for the 9mm Parabellum cartridge. The Chinese began exporting both pistols and ammunition in 1987 at very reasonable prices. The cartridge is very similar to the 7.63mm Mauser and some brands of Mauser ammunition can be fired in the Tokarev pistol. Well initially, introduced as a combat handgun cartridge, however, the 7.62mm Russian is a fair feild cartridge for small game as it has good velocity and flat trajactory, but needs softpoint or hunting-type bullets for maximum effectiveness. Loading data for the 7.63mm Mauser can be used. The Speer 30-caliber plinker bullet of 100 grains makes a good hunting bullet, but because it is highly greater than standard weight, it must be loaded down a bit in velocity.', ''),

(336655, 'Review: Winchester SX3 Shotgun Winchester SX3 Shotgun Review \r\n\r\nThe Winchester Super X3 (SX3) Composite shotgun is the model preferred by many hunters because of its trim dimensions that feel and balance perfectly in your hands.\r\nThe self-adjusting Active Valve gas system and proprietary next generation In flex Technology recoil pad reduce felt recoil as much as 50% over that of inertia-operated auto loaders for faster follow-up shots and prolonged shooting comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DSCF0667.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3FULL.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3DISMNTLD.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPANY FACTS: \r\n\r\nIt is the fastest semi-Automatic shotgun in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specifications\r\n\r\n\r\nCategory: FIREARMS - SHOTGUNS \r\nMake: Winchester Super X3 ( SX3 )\r\nAction : Gas operated Semi-Automatic\r\nGauge :12 \r\nBarrel Length :28 inches\r\nCapacity :4 + 1\r\nChamber :3"\r\nWeight :7 lbs\r\nChokes: 3 chokes included\r\nStock :Synthetic\r\nFinish :Gunmetal Grey Perma-Cote Ultra Tough, Dura-Touch armor coating. \r\n\r\n\r\nPacking\r\n\r\nThe SX3 comes in a not very impressive cardboard box, which includes the following with the gun:\r\n5 SHIMS\r\n2 SPACERS\r\n3 Choke tubes (Full, Modified and Improved Cylinder)\r\nGun lock\r\nSling swivel studs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinish & Looks \r\n\r\nA gunmetal gray Perma-Cote UT (Ultra Tough) surface finish is applied to external metal surfaces for extreme corrosion protection, while the bolt is plated with electrolytes nickel for reduced friction and added corrosion resistance.\r\nThe composite fiber model has a very bold new dashing look. I personally don''t like the looks of the wooden model.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrip, Stock, Cast and Drop\r\nDura Touch Armor Coating provides a sure grip during wet weather conditions.\r\nInserts/Spacers (4 come in the box) can easily be added or removed between the stock to adapt your gun to your exact measurements. Length can be adjusted from 349mm to 375mm (14 inches to 15 inches ). \r\nShims (5 come in the box) fit between the butt stock and receiver, allowing customized adjustments to the comb and heel. \r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3BUTT.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAction & Barrel \r\nThe Barrel of the Sx3 is Back-bored which enables you to obtain perfect shot patterns.\r\nBack-boring ensures that there is less friction between the shot and the wall of the barrel. Less friction means more of the energy generated by the gunpowder is used hence resulting in increased velocity of the load.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3RECEIVER.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3BARREL.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nBalance and Recoil\r\n\r\nIt has a reliable Active Value Gas operated system, which is adjusted automatically and significantly reduces recoil.\r\nThe design of the grip and fore-end contribute to the excellent handling of the gun.\r\nSX3 is not a soft shooting gun but the feel and balance make up for the recoil. After a good day of shooting you would notice less fatigue with the SX3.\r\n\r\n\r\nSights\r\n\r\nFront Sight: Metal bead.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagazine & Chokes\r\n\r\nThe Magazine capacity is 4+1. Magazine extension tubes are also available that can increase the shell capacity to up to 10+1.\r\n\r\nThe gun comes with 3 In vector+ chokes ( F,M,IC ). These are long sized chokes especially for Back-Bored barrels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Mechanism\r\n\r\nThe shotgun has a cross-bolt type safety and is placed behind the trigger. The safety is reversible for right or left handed operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReliability\r\n\r\nI found the gun to be pretty reliable in both water fowling and upland hunting. There were shell jams initially but I guess it was due to the Break in period.\r\n\r\nIt rained continuously for 3 hours during the last duck shoot and the gun fired flawlessly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nMaintenance is not an issue with the SX3. The gun can be easily stripped apart and cleaned. However the gas piston is complicatedly built and needs time and effort to be cleaned.\r\n\r\nPrice\r\nThe gun is currently selling under 170k.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern Test:\r\nI have lost the 2 other chokes so could only pattern test the weapon with the modified choke. \r\n\r\nA little about patterns first.\r\n\r\nPattern test is conducted to check the shot density, which is very important.\r\n\r\nWe need to determine the range at which we most often take, or would like to take, our game and go for the optimum pattern at that range.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the pattern tests, The SX3 performed well and displayed good hunting level patterns. \r\n\r\nPattern test Details:\r\n\r\nShooter.....................Kakar\r\nShotgun:...................Winchester SX3\r\nAmmo:......................Shaheen # 4, #6 Super, BB & SG\r\nChoke:......................Modified\r\nDistance:..................20, 30 & 40 Yards \r\nTechnique:................Standing\r\nTarget:....................Chart paper ( 44'''' x 30'''' )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # \r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # 4\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................20 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......200\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........196\r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...98%\r\n\r\nAt this 20 yards distance the pattern very concentrated with 98% pellets in the 30” circle. The pattern is capable of taking down any large, medium or small bird but there is high probability of the the game meat being destroyed.\r\nRead pellet count as 196 instead of 210 in the pic.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3420M.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 2\r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # 4\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................30 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......200\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........168\r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...84%\r\n\r\nAt this 30 yards distance the pattern is wide open with a good percentage of 84% pellets in the 30” circle and is capable of harvesting all duck sizes out to the 40 yard mark. The high pattern count would make it particularly effective on small and medium sized ducks.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3430.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 3\r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # 6 Super\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................30 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......340\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........198\r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...58%\r\n\r\nAt this 30 yards distance the pattern is wide open with a few pellet free areas but we should not be overly concerned about them as long as they don’t dominate the overall pattern picture. The pattern is capable of harvesting small and medium sized birds. This combination is not advisable for large birds as the pellets of load # 6 are small and won''t be able to penetrate to the vital areas to make a kill and would just injure the large bird.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3630M.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 4\r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # 6 Super\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................40 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......340\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........72\r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...21%\r\n\r\nThis is a very blown pattern at 40 yards and is not recommended for any challenging hunting situation. With only 21% pellets in the 30” circle added with the small pellets of load# 6 and longer distance of 40 yards, the combination is highly undesirable. \r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3640.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 5\r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # BB\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................30 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......76\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........70\r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...92%\r\n\r\nAt this 30 yards distance the pattern is wide open in the middle with only a few strikes around the edges of the 30”circle. The pellet percentage of 92% is pretty good and the combination is capable of harvesting large size ducks. However, the relatively low pellet count does not make it a good choice for small and medium ducks.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3BB30M.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 6\r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # 4\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................20 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......200\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........196  \r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...98%\r\n\r\nThis pattern has been discussed above. A teal duck has been placed to show a real type situation. A duck of this size if hit by this combination ( modified + Shot # 4 + 20 Yards ) will take approximately 25 to 30 pellets and as mentioned above, will damage the game meat.\r\nRead pellet count as 196 instead of 210 in the pic.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3DUCK420M.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 7\r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # 6 Super\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................40 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......340\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........72\r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...21%\r\n\r\nThis pattern has been discussed above. A teal duck has been placed to show a real type situation. A duck of this size if hit by this combination ( modified + Shot # 6 + 40 Yards ) would most probably fly away with taking 1 or 2 non-fatal pellets. There are a lot of pellet free areas and the energy of small pellets of shot # 6 at 40 yards is quite little.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3DUCK640.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 8\r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # BB\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................30 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......76\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........70\r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...92%\r\n\r\nThis pattern has been discussed above. A teal duck has been placed to show a real type situation. This combination ( modified + Shot # BB + 30 yards ) should be avoided on small size ducks as the chances of misses are high due to the low pellet count. Having said that it can easily take down a small bird with a single hit pellet.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3DUCKBB30.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 9\r\nAmmo:..........................Shaheen # SG\r\nChoke:......................... Modified\r\nDistance:......................30 Yards \r\nPellets in loaded shell.......9\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:.........9\r\n% of pellets in 30" circle...100%\r\n\r\nAt 30 yards the pattern with 100% pellet percentage is evenly balanced. The combination is capable of taking down a wild boar, deer, hog deer size animal instantly with pellets hitting the head, chest and back.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3SG30.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMistakes generally made by new shot gunners:\r\n\r\nChoosing more choke ( e.g modified instead of Cylinder ) than is actually required for a specific application is the single most common mistake made by those who are new to shotgunning.\r\nIt is best for a beginning shot gunner to start with less choke than he/she thinks he/she needs and then work up to tighter chokes as required.\r\n\r\nThe two most common mistakes inexperienced shot gunners make are lifting the head from the stock as they fire and stopping the swing as the trigger is squeezed. Keeping your cheek glued to the stock as the gun fires is an absolute must as failing to do so will usually cause you to shoot over the target. Stopping your swing just as you pull the trigger will cause you to shoot behind the target.', ''),

I must insist that it is one hell of an awesome looking shotgun. every single line just portrays pure elegance. i''m sure it must be one pleasurable shooting firearm as well.\r\n\r\nif you kindly allow I do have a few questions regarding the patterns. \r\n\r\n1. the pattern with modified choke at 20 yards should have been no more than 20-25 inches whereas I can see the shotgun patterns around 30 inches. have you tried any other brand of ammo cause it could be shaheen messing with an over bored barrel.\r\n\r\n2. same goes for the 30 yard pattern. it should have been somewhere between 32-35 inches max whereas this shotgun seem to pattern around 35inches plus\r\n\r\n3. at 40 yards, the pattern is too huge. it should not have been more than 40-46 inches with modified choke.\r\n\r\n4. similarly if you look using the other popular approach of evaluating chokes, the pattern at 40 yards should have 60% of pellets inside a 30 inch circle whereas this shotgun patterns at 21%.\r\n\r\ni''m guessing, it could be the ammo messing with the over bored barrel. have you tried any other brand of ammo with better gas seal? i''m totally open to the idea that i''m wrong here.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

It uses the Browning linkless cam locking system similar to that used in the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Hi-Power"][COLOR=black]Browning Hi-Power[/COLOR][/URL] pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked together on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated by the slide release lever''s transverse pin. After the first few millimeters of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge. Most models have the capability of being fired in both [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_%28firearms%29"][COLOR=black]single[/COLOR][/URL] and [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_%28firearms%29"][COLOR=black]double action[/COLOR][/URL] modes, and feature a frame-mounted [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_%28firearms%29"][COLOR=black]manual safety[/COLOR][/URL]. Some recent models have a decoking lever that doubles as a manual safety. Starting in the early 1990s, all CZ 75s have been made with [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firing_pin_block"][COLOR=black]firing pin blocks[/COLOR][/URL], designated by the letter B (as in CZ 75B). The CZ 75 was one of the first high capacity 9mm pistols with a manual safety similar to that of the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Hi-Power"][COLOR=black]Browning Hi-Power[/COLOR][/URL]. This allows the CZ 75 to be carried with the hammer cocked with safety applied and a round chambered, ready for use simply by switching the safety off --- a configuration known as [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Cooper_%28colonel%29#The_Modern_Technique"][COLOR=black]condition one[/COLOR][/URL]. It is somewhat unusual for double-action pistols to have this "cocked and locked" type of safety; most such as the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_P38"][COLOR=black]Walther P38[/COLOR][/URL] and the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92F"][COLOR=black]Beretta 92F[/COLOR][/URL] have a combination safety/decoking lever (as do later versions of the CZ 75). The trade-off of this configuration is that to uncock the hammer for a double action first shot, the hammer must be dropped manually by pulling the trigger while lowering the hammer with the firer''s thumb under control. Once lowered in this manner, a double action first shot can be achieved in a similar manner to other double action pistols without actuating any controls. Subsequent shots will be single action unless the hammer is again manually lowered. Unlike most other semi-auto pistols, the slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside, similar to the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_P210"][COLOR=black]SIG P210[/COLOR][/URL]. This provides a tight slide-to-frame fit and a very efficient barrel lock up, both of which contribute to good accuracy. Both frame and slide are castings, though forgings have been used in very early production models. The 6-groove barrel has traditional land-and-groove rifling with a higher than-standard rate of twist (1 in 9.7).[B][COLOR=black][/COLOR][/B][/SIZE][/FONT]\n   [B][FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4][COLOR=black]Production[/COLOR][COLOR=black]: [/COLOR][COLOR=black]Originally designed for export, the CZ Model 75 entered mass production in 1976.

There are several models that only come in this finish: CZ 75B SA, CZ 75BD, CZ 75 DAO, etc. According to CZ-USA and the anecdotal experience of CZF members, this is the second-most durable finish overall. It is susceptible to being chipped if struck hard enough. Apparently, kydex holsters will "cut" this finish, much as is seen on Glocks. Theoretically, it is maintenance-free, but silicone cloths do give it a more glossy appearance. Polycoat is a form of polymer plastic that is applied with an electrostatic process. Cleaning solvents that are not to be used on plastic should be avoided.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n   [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]\n    [B]2) Glossy Blue[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=4]   [/SIZE][FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]: This finish (and all of the other premium finishes) adds about $20 to the MSRP in the U.S. Glossy blue is very attractive, but it is definitely the least durable. Also, this finish truly is more "glossy" than some other brands'' blued finishes, so fingerprints and the like show up very clearly. This is actually helpful, since the elements and oil from your skin will damage it. One can see the areas that require cleaning. Leather holsters will damage this finish. Tannic acid from the leather corrodes the bluing, as will some solvents. Bluing must be treated with oil or similar products to protect the finish. (This is all true of bluing in general, not just CZs.)[/SIZE][/FONT]\n   [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]\n    [B]3) Satin Nickel:[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=4]   [/SIZE][FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4] This is the most durable finish. Like stainless and the polycoat finish, it is theoretically maintenance free. Also, like these, some maintenance will keep it looking more attractive to the eye. Over time, oil from the skin, powder residue, etc. will dull the finish, but a light touch-up with Flitz metal polish will restore its appearance. Satin nickel is a coating over carbon steel, not stainless steel. Like the polymer, it is weatherproof, etc. The external controls (safety and slide release) on satin nickel models appear to be black polycoat. My understanding is that a holster cannot hurt this finish, but Kydex might "cut" it over time as well.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n   [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]\n    [B]4) Dual Tone:[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=4]   [/SIZE][FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4] This is a matte blue slide on a satin nickel frame. The external controls appear to be matte blue (but are often black polycoat). It is visually quite striking, but the blued portions still have the maintenance drawbacks of all blued finishes.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n   [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]\n    [B]5) Dual Tone Polycoat[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=4]   [/SIZE][FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]: This finish is unique to the limited production CZ 75B Tactical. This finish is a black polycoat slide on an olive drab polycoat frame. The external controls appear to be black polycoat. Like the premium dual tone finish, this combination is quite striking, yet this version retains all of the advantages of the polycoat finish.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n   [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]\n    [B]6) Matte Blue:[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=4]   [/SIZE][FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4] No entire pistols with this finish are being imported by CZ-USA at this time. This was a fairly common finish on Type A and "transitional" pistols in the 75/85 series imported by other firms before 1995. Pistols with this finish are still manufactured by CZ-UB, but it appears that it is being phased out in favor of the black polycoat. Matte blue causes some identification problems. It is very difficult to distinguish it from black polycoat or enamel unless representatives of each are lying side-by-side. One way to be certain on an older import is to field strip the pistol. Matte blue will show up on the internals, but polycoat and enamel do not (bare carbon steel shows on the inside of the slide). Like all blued guns, matte blue pistols require regular maintenance every time they are handled.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n   [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]\n    [B]7) Enamel: [/B][/SIZE][/FONT]   [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]Before CZ perfected its polycoat finish in the early 1990s, a finish of enamel or lacquer was often used in its place. This was a common finish from 1979-1986. This is the absolute worst finish CZ has ever used. Normal holstering and firing will wear this finish quickly; it is thin and brittle. On the bright side, it is maintenance free. Like the polycoat, it will look better if lightly oiled.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n   [FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4]\n    [B]8) Parkerization:[/B][/SIZE][/FONT][SIZE=4]   [/SIZE][FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=4] Some Type A CZs from the 1980s are Parkerized, which is a type of phosphate coating. This is a very desirable finish to find on a used CZ from this period, as the enamel and matte blued models are usually in need of refinishing. Parkerization is maintenance free, but it does not benefit as much as some of the other finishes from superficial cleaning.

We planned for a visit to some area 60 KM from jhang where reports were excellent. We reached via Peer mahel because our host had arranged for some sumptuous lunch at Saturday. Due to some rain, we stayed there and planned to move at 3. Am. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]Our journey started right at 3.15 am and we covered the metal road distance in an hour. There was another 8 km rough track to reach the river bank and to our hideouts. After covering almost 6 odd kilometers it starts drizzling around 4.15 am which got rhythm quickly. We were traveling by two VTI cars which were not obviously fit for such happening. They started a dangerous zigzag travelling. It was me who first slipped rare wheels in a wheat field but I quick recovery after using some previous experience but other car was automatic gear and we were feared about it. Bad luck the second car slipped and badly slept. We were a hundred meter ahead of them and reached a dera when we received a call that not only they have slipped in but they have also damaged house-pipe.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]We arranged a tractor and pulled the car to dera. It was 7. am now. The hunting had fished, now its time to think for return but there was no question about it. Anyhow, we covered another 2 KM distance by foot and reached the host hut with just some important belongings. Rains continued till 12 noon. Meanwhile, we kept struggling for arranging pipe but there no way for going out of this hell, even by tractors. We were not planned at all for staying here all the night, nor dressed up. The clothes were fully wet and we all were shivering with cold. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]Anyway, we have to spend this night this was the ground reality which we have to face. Long cut short it was a horrible and memorable night we have ever spent. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]Adding to it, there was a true report ducks were in lacks not in thousands around but we were not in position to pull the trigger even. While leaving from car, we just carried 2 mojo&#8217;s, decoys were left in car. We planned to place only mojos next morning and got 10 ducks, 2 gadwalls, 2 pintails, 1 mallard and 5 teals only in an hour and got back because we were in hurry for going back as everybody was worried about reaching metal road.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]We reached back to cars around 11 am Monday, pipe was arranged there by some hectic efforts by our nice host but track was still not in position to travel. We waited till 3. Pm, meanwhile some tractors trollies passed through this track and made some deep tracks. Our host arranged two tractors and a strong rope and our travel started. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]If Japanese could see what we are doing with HONDA certainly they stop further export to Pakistan.

I should have done some sort of [I]B.Ed[/I] in weapons, if offered by any university, lolz!\n \nAnyhow, at times it''s very hard to explain easy things in complex terms, at times the totally opposite!\n \nThe round that you fire basically consists of two parts, the shell and the projectile, of which the 1.st,hence the shell, is extracted sidewards after fire, and the second part moving down the barrel and out of the muzzle is called the projectile. [I]9 [/I]refers to the cross sectional diameter in millimeters of the [I]round base of the projectile. [B]19[/B] refers to the [B]length[/B] of this part, leaving the barrel towards your target, in millimeters.[/I]\n \nIn case, you don''t field strip your gun, no, you don''t spray it all over with a cleaner, you only spray and clean the barrel.\n \n"How is the recoil" is simply asked to know with how much force the slide moves back and how much the gun moves in your hand, how much the muzzle flip is, how hard/easy it is for you to control the shots and place them accurately. The lighter the recoil, the better your shot placements.\n \nNow, let me answer your next question as well, before it lands here, larger, heavier guns, have less of recoil, than smaller and lighter. Hence, steeled guns have lighter recoil than polymer.\n \nFinally, a spray-can of Brunox, Hoppes No. 9 gun oil, is generally enough for the new gun owner. This is actually so variable, no rules.\n \n \nI hope this was simple enough.\n \n \nRegards.', ''),

(336786, ' Thank you Dr. Zakir, hskhan2k2 and Trigger sahib..\n\nThank you 12 Gauge sahab for the appreciation. Sir, regarding your first 2 questions I think the patterns are within the 20 to 25 and 32 to 35 inches area. Area of the chart paper is 30" X 44" and on the computer screen if you measure with a scale, 1" = 4''''. I measured it with a scale and with the exception of 3 to 7 pellets, all pellets come within your mentioned measurements. Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nComing to the other questions, I totally agree with you that the patterns are too much blown which should not be the case with modern shotguns. I also did a pattern test of my Beretta A400 with similar results (will post the results today). As you said, the only culprit I can think of is the Shaheen cartridge.\nHave not tried any other brand ammo. Will do that in the coming days.\n\nThank you francolino sahab.  Guess my pattern tests show 84% result at 30 yards with M choke. Regarding your combo choice, I personally don''t like using the IC choke and normally use Modified. If a partridge or quail is too close for a M choke then you can always let it fly away a few yards and take the shot then. I have ordered the IC choke from Cabelas and will do a pattern test when in hand. After that I can shed some light on your choice of combinations.', ''),

It cycles 2 ¾”, 3” and 3 ½” cartridges.\r\n\r\nThe action has a new self cleaning piston.\r\n\r\nThe A400 also has a magazine cut off.\r\n\r\nBeretta’s patented Kick Off recoil-reduction system houses two hydraulic dampeners to reduce recoil by up to 60 percent and a third shock absorber in the stock bolt to further reduce recoil and mechanical stress during cycling. \r\n\r\nWith this gun, hunters and shooters can go for longer periods in between cleaning sessions as the amount of gas from the barrel is half of what is present in previous Beretta’s semi-autos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPANY FACTS: \r\n\r\n- Recoil with the A400 has been reduced by a massive 70%. \r\n-All-load top performance (24g - 64g) \r\n-It boasts the world’s fastest firing and recycling time - 36% faster than any other semi-auto out there.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DSCF1404.jpg[/img] \r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DSCF1409.jpg[/img] \r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/FULL.jpg[/img] \r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DISMNTLD.jpg[/img] \r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/fullwithbirds.jpg[/img] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specifications:\r\n\r\nCategory: Firearms-- Shotgun\r\nMake: Beretta A400 Xplor Unico \r\nType: Gas-operated semi automatic\r\nGauge: 12 \r\nChamber: 3 inches\r\nCapacity: 3+1\r\nBarrel Length: 28 inches. \r\nWeight: 6.6 pounds \r\nChoke: Three Optima choke tubes included \r\nSights: Vent rib w/front bead \r\nStock: Oil-finished X-tra Grain walnut wood\r\nFinish: Green anodized receiver, blued-steel barrel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPacking:\r\n\r\nXplor comes in a beautiful green plastic carry case of superior quality. Inside the case following items are included with the gun; \r\n\r\n- 3 Optima chokes ( F, M, C )\r\n- Shim\r\n- Beretta oil \r\n- Choke key\r\n- Sling swivel studs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinish, Looks & Quality:\r\n\r\nThe gun is pretty good looking and is made out of the best raw materials available. \r\nThe Xtra wood has an oil finish and a checkering pattern.\r\nThe fore-end is even more dramatic, as the eye-catching trident trademark of Beretta is placed front and center on the bottom of the fore-end.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/FOREARMLOGO.jpg[/img] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrip & Stock\r\n\r\nBeretta has redesigned the butt stock and fore-end for enhanced handling and gripping qualities. Beginning with select walnut, Beretta uses a proprietary process called X-tra Grain to enhance the grain, and it''s really effective. \r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/BUTT.jpg[/img] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAction & Barrel:\r\n\r\nThe barrel is made from a new material which Beretta call ‘Steelium’ (a very tough modern steel) and for which they claim all sorts of advantages. The feed system on the A400 has also been modified. The new gun will digest High Performance steel shot as well as regular lead loads.\r\n\r\nUnlike other commercial steel, these barrels are deep-drilled and cold-hammer forged in a production line with nine hammering machines. \r\n\r\nOne of the shortest receivers on the market - and it''s colored green! \r\n\r\nXplor features the third generation of Beretta’s Optima Bore High Performance (HP) barrels and Beretta Optima Choke HP choke tubes that work with traditional lead shot, standard steel shot and high performance steel shot. \r\n\r\nA ring between the barrel and receiver is designed to reduce barrel vibration and enhance pellet pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/RECEIVER2.jpg[/img] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrigger:\r\n\r\nThe trigger is smooth and crisp \r\n\r\n\r\nBalance and Recoil:\r\n\r\nUnico''s recoil reduction system comprises of three shock absorbers - one fitted to the inner stock bolt and the other two contained within the stock and recoil pad.\r\n\r\nThe KO3 is a small hydraulic cylinder in the butt stock that the bolt intentionally impacts at the end of its travel, providing shock absorption and cushioning that no plastic bolt buffer can provide. \r\n\r\nI must admit that it has a very soft recoil, that of a 20 Gauge. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/BUTTSCOK3.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSights:\r\n\r\nFront Sight: Metal bead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMagazine:\r\n\r\nThe Magazine capacity is 3+1. The A400 does not support a magazine extension tube as the piston sits on top of the magazine tube mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety Mechanism:\r\n\r\nThe gun comes with a beautiful newly designed reversible safety. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReliability:\r\n\r\nExtremely reliable gun. Took it out NIB and fired around 700 shells on 4 hunts with no FTF & FTE at all. Also had a chance to shoot with it during heavy rain, with no problems again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance:\r\n\r\nThe internals of the gun have been made very simple and that is why I find the cleaning of this gun the easiest as compared to any other shotgun.\r\n\r\nThe piston is made so simple that it takes seconds to clean it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice:\r\n\r\nThe gun is currently selling under 300k.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern Test:\r\n\r\nA little about patterns first.\r\n\r\nPattern test is conducted to check the shot density, which is very important.\r\n\r\nWe need to determine the range at which we most often take, or would like to take, our game and go for the optimum pattern at that range.\r\n\r\nShooter......................Kakar\r\nShotgun:....................Beretta A400 Xplor Unico\r\nAmmo:.......................Shaheen # 4, #6 Super, BB & SG\r\nChoke:.......................Cylinder, Modified & Full\r\nDistance:...................20, 30 & 40 Yards\r\nTechnique:.................Standing\r\nTarget:......................Chart paper ( 44'''' x 30'''' )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPattern # 1\r\nAmmo:................................Shaheen # 4\r\nChoke:.................................Cylinder\r\nDistance:.............................20 Yards\r\nPellets in loaded shell.............200\r\nPellets in 30'''' circle:...............145\r\n% of pellets in 30” circle.........73%\r\n\r\nAt this 30 yards distance the pattern is wide open with a good percentage of 73% pellets in the 30” circle and is capable of harvesting all duck sizes out to the 20 yard mark.

Keeping your cheek glued to the stock as the gun fires is an absolute must as failing to do so will usually cause you to shoot over the target. Stopping your swing just as you pull the trigger will cause you to shoot behind the target.', ''),

(336873, ' [B]32 Smith & Wesson Long[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis cartridge was developed for the Smith & Wesson. First Model, solid-frame, hand-ejector revolver introduced in 1903. The same cartridge with a flat, pointed bullet is the 32 Colt New Police. Colt, Harrington & Richardson, Iver Jhonson and Smith & Wesson were the principal companies making revolvers of this caliber in the U.S. Many Spanish and other European revolvers such as the Banyard and Pickert chambered the round. In Europe, it had not been as widely used as the shorter 32 S&W until some ISU centerfire target shooters discovered the 32 S&W Long, and noe there are several high-class European target autoloaders for the round.\r\nThe 32 S&W Long is the smallest revolver cartridge deemed adequate for police use in United States, and it has been fairly popular with detectives or plain clothesmen. It has always been available in a variety of short, light, small-frame revolvers, some of them very well made. It has a reputation for excellent accuracy and has been used for target and match shooting in the past as well as now in ISU shooting. It is potentially as accurate as the 38 S&W Special, but not as versatile. It is about the minimum size for sporting use and with handloaded, hunting-type bullets is quite effective on small game or birds. It is not as popular or widely used for defensive a it once was because of the development of light-frame 38-caliber revolvers. Its range and effectiveness can be increased quite a bit by handloading.', ''),

(336877, ' [B]32 Harrington & Richardson Magnum[/B]\r\n\r\n the 32 H&R Magnum was the result of a joint project between Harrington & Richardson and the Federal Cartridge company. It was introduced in 1984 for the H&R Model 504, 532 and 586 revolvers, all of five shot capacity. This was followed in the same year by Charter Arms with their six-shot 32 H&R Magnum Police Undercoer revolver and in 1985 by the Ruger Model 32 Magnum Single-Six revolver. The 32 H&R Magnum is simply the older 32 Smith & Wesson Long case lengthed by .155-inch. Therefore, any 32 magnum revolver will also accept and fire both the 32 S&W  and the 32 S&W long. This makes for a rather convenient and flexible situation because the shooter has a choice of three different cartridges that will work with one handgun, although each would require a different sight setting for precision shooting. Two loadings of the cartridge are available, either a semi-wadcutter bullet of 95 grains or an 85 grain jacketed hollowpoint.\r\nAccording to factory ballistic data, the 32 Magnum delivers almost double the energy of the 32 S&W Long and about 13 percent more energy than the standard 38 Special load. However, chronograph tests with various length revolver barrels demonstrated that actual velocity at the muzzel ranges from 60 to 100 fps below the factory-advertised figures. Neverthless, the cartridge performance level is well above that of any other 32-caliber handgun currently available. Some observers believe that the 32 Magnum will emerge as a popular self-defence cartridge in light, short, small-frame revolers. Others are of the opinion that it is better suited to feild use as a small game and varmint cartridge. In any event, the eventual popularity will depend to a large extent on the type and quality of the handguns that chamber it as well as the accuracy and effectiveness of available ammunition. There has long been a moderate interest in a 32 magnum and the H&R offering may just be what is needed to promote a much wider market demand once the shooting public has had an opportunity to realize the advantages of a smaller magnum cartridge. After all, one dosent need a cannon to shoot small game.', '');

(336879, ' [B]9mm Luger (Parabellum)[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 9mm Luger, or 9mm Parabellum, was introduced with the Model of 1902 Luger automatic pistol. It was adopted by the German navy in 1904 and by the German army in 1908. Since that time, it has been used by the military of practically by every European power. It is the world''s most popular and widely-used military handgun cartridge. It has also been used extinsively in submachine guns. In the United States, Colt, Smith & Wesson, Ruger and many others chamber the 9mm, and there were too many foreign-made pistols to list here that are also available in it. In 1985, the 9mm was adopted as the official military cartridge by U.S. Armed forces (to replace the 45auto) along with the Beretta Model 92-F (M-9) 15-shot semi-auto pistol.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the 9mm Luger delivers rather good performance for police, military or sporting use, it was not very popular in the U.S. until fairly recently. The principal reason may have been that no American-made arms were chambered for it early on. In 1954, Smith & Wesson brought out their new Model 39 automatic in this calibre and Colt chambered their lighweight Commander for the 9mm Luger, as well as the 45 and 38 Super in 1951. This, plus the influx of surplus 9mm military automatics imported after the war, greatly increased its popularity and acceptance in the country. At the present time, it is probably as widely used by American handgunners as any of other automatic pistol cartridge except possibly 45 auto. The principal complaint has always been that the 9mm Luger lacks stopping power as a defensive cartridge, and there are plenty of examples to prove this point. Howeer, the only automatic pistol cartridge with proven stopping power is the 45 ACP.', ''),

It was adopted shortly after the end of WWII, and its design may have been inspired by an experimental German cartridge called the 9mm Ultra. Other countries within the Russian political and military sephere also use the round.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet 9mm pistol cartridge is intermediate in size and power between the 380 ACP and the 9mm Luger. It is a well-designed cartridge for its purpose, although a little underpowered by western standards. It would be satisfatory for small game if loaded with hunting-type bullets.

(336885, ' [B]357 Magnum[/B]\r\n\r\nIntroduced in 1935 by Smith & Wesson for their heavy-frame revolver. The ammunition was developed by Winchester in co-operation with Smith & Wesson. Major Douglas B. Wesson (of S&W) and Philip B. Sharpe are also credited with much of the final development work. The 357 Magnum is based on the 38 Special case lengthened about 1/10 inch, so it will not chamber in standard 38 Special revolvers. This was the most powerful handgun cartridge in the world until 44 Magnum was introduced in 1955. Colt, Ruger, Taurus and Smith & Wesson manufacture revolvers of various types for this cartridge. There has also been a proliferation of imported single and double-action revolvers and seeral single shot pistols chamber it. \r\nProbably the most popular high-velosity handgun cartridge in the United States for police, hunting or target work. It provides about double the elocity and more than three times the energy of the standard 38 Special load. It is noted for its flat trajactory, deep penetration and great knock-down power. It has been used successfully on deer, black bear, elk and even grizzly bear. However, it is not really adequate for these large animals unless used by a good handgun shot. It is also used in repeating and single shot rifles as matched arms to go along with the revolver. In a 20 to 24-inch rifle barrel, the standard factory load will develop about 1650 fps muzzle velocity and special handloads will develop over 2000.

Proper fitted stock(Even the curve and radius of the grip counts a lot).\r\n\r\n2. Adjustment of trigger shoe,so that shooter gets that particular part of\r\n    the finger placed on the trigger shoe,which gives him/her a quick timming\r\n    in pressing the trigger.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.Balancing the shotgun,although it comes in stock fitting,but we\r\n may experiment by trying few shots with true HINGE PIN point of \r\n balance or a shade heavier towards muzzle end.Sometimes shade\r\n heavier ones swing better than true balanced ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Chokes vs Ammo pattern tests(NO KANJOOSI WOULD BE TOLERABLE)\r\n for these tests,we must invest in different brands of Ammo in 24-gm \r\n category and conduct proper tests to know about our patterns at given\r\n range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   [B]                  NOW FOR BAIKAL SPORTING[/B].\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n 1.Making of a new stock.(Although the factory one, can be \r\n    modified with UGLY looks)\r\n\r\n\r\n 2. Buying New compatible custom chokes.(But after initial tests\r\n     of supplied ones).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 3. Stone grinding SEARS notches to bring down trigger pulls to 3-lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

They are built, either from ground up or converted from a hunting platform, for sporting use. along with solid build, they offer certain features which aid in sporting use. the reason for a solid built gun is that a sporting shotgun has to withstand high volume shooting associated with typical shotgun related sports.\n \nWeight is usually of a lesser concern because the operator doesn''t have to carry it all day long. when the turn is up, he/she has to put it back on the stand. infact, more wight lessens recoil and makes the swing more smoother.\n \nMostly, sporting shotguns are expensive when compared to their hunting counterparts. almost all major shotgun manufacturers offer a sporting lineup along with typical hunting product line. Similarly, Baikal [B]MP-27-EM-1C "Sporting"[/B] is a shotgun offered by [B]"IZHEVSKY MEKHANICHESKY ZAVOD"[/B], for the shotgun related sporting activities.

Things I loved:[/B]\n \n1. wide rib\n2. trigger\n3. forend\n4. receiver finish\n5. checkering\n6. finish of the nickel receiver\n7. porting\n \n[B]2. Things I liked:[/B]\n \n1. barrel finish\n2. wood to metal finish\n3. furniture\n4. the design of the recoil pad\n5. balance\n6. weight\n7. good and clean construction of receiver and its internals\n \n[B]3. Things that I did not like:[/B]\n \n1. choke tube finish (another reason for me to recommend trulock chokes)\n2. hard opening and closing of the boxlock receiver. this is typical of all brand new Baikal shotguns.\n3. hardness of the safety switch. this is also typical of all brand new Baikal shotguns.\n4. rough and sharp metal edges here and there. Russian Finish, cant really complain right? ;)\n5. engraving: it is supposed to look like a clay bird in motion instead to me it looked like a flying UFO (saucer) or may be a Frisbee. a simple and elegant floral design would have been a lot nicer.\n \n[B]4. Things that I hated:[/B]\n \n1. front bead: it sucks, I''ll suggest either to get it replaced or paint it white\n2. the recoil pad finish: I dont know what to say about it. the design is good but the finish is so poor that one cannot look at it for more than two seconds. its presented in strange red color (looks brownish) which looks worn out and kinda cheapish.\n3. the internals had some of the nastiest stuff on the planet. all sorts of funny looking preservative along with wood and metal shavings were all over the place.\n4. the bottom choke tube was literally stuck. I had to use all my force (to a point that I got a good bowl movement afterwards) just to unscrew it out for cleaning. I was surprised to see that the threads were fine and clean and it was the preservative which jammed the choke in its thread. the company should have used some sort of antisieze/copper grease instead of regular preservative. regular preservatives are used only for rust protection and upto some extent lubrication. they are not designed for threaded applications and long term storage.\n \n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\n \nBaikal MP-27-EM-1C "Sporting" offers everything that a sports oriented shotgun should and at a price that probably no other manufacturer can compete with. it not only offers excellent utility but it also offers some features that are present on high end shotguns priced many times more than this Russian Shot Spitting Beast. [B]if one wants to get the most out of their hard earned buck then Baikal MP-27-EM-1C "Sporting" is probably the best budget gun that money can buy[/B].', 'Review: Baikal MP27-EM-1C &quot;Sporting&quot;'),

I personally don''t like the looks of the wooden model.\n \n \nGrip, Stock, Cast and Drop\nDura Touch Armor Coating provides a sure grip during wet weather conditions.\nInserts/Spacers (4 come in the box) can easily be added or removed between the stock to adapt your gun to your exact measurements. Length can be adjusted from 349mm to 375mm (14 inches to 15 inches ). \nShims (5 come in the box) fit between the butt stock and receiver, allowing customized adjustments to the comb and heel. \n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3BUTT.jpg[/IMG]\n \n \n \nAction & Barrel \nThe Barrel of the Sx3 is Back-bored which enables you to obtain perfect shot patterns.\nBack-boring ensures that there is less friction between the shot and the wall of the barrel. Less friction means more of the energy generated by the gunpowder is used hence resulting in increased velocity of the load.\n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3RECEIVER.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/SX3BARREL.jpg[/IMG]\n \n \nBalance and Recoil\n \nIt has a reliable Active Value Gas operated system, which is adjusted automatically and significantly reduces recoil.\nThe design of the grip and fore-end contribute to the excellent handling of the gun.\nSX3 is not a soft shooting gun but the feel and balance make up for the recoil. After a good day of shooting you would notice less fatigue with the SX3.\n \n \nSights\n \nFront Sight: Metal bead.\n \n \nMagazine & Chokes\n \nThe Magazine capacity is 4+1. Magazine extension tubes are also available that can increase the shell capacity to up to 10+1.\n \nThe gun comes with 3 In vector+ chokes ( F,M,IC ). These are long sized chokes especially for Back-Bored barrels.\n \n \n \nSafety Mechanism\n \nThe shotgun has a cross-bolt type safety and is placed behind the trigger. The safety is reversible for right or left handed operation.\n \n \n \nReliability\n \nI found the gun to be pretty reliable in both water fowling and upland hunting.

(337099, 'Review: Beretta A400 Xplor Shotgun; Review: Beretta A400 Xplor Shotgun; The A400 is an extremely well-built gas-operated auto loader. This new Beretta is quite light, but it is designed to shoot a very wide range of loads from 24 to 64 grams. It cycles 2 ¾”, 3” and 3 ½” cartridges.\n \nThe action has a new self cleaning piston.\n \nThe A400 also has a magazine cut off.\n \nBeretta’s patented Kick Off recoil-reduction system houses two hydraulic dampeners to reduce recoil by up to 60 percent and a third shock absorber in the stock bolt to further reduce recoil and mechanical stress during cycling. \n \nWith this gun, hunters and shooters can go for longer periods in between cleaning sessions as the amount of gas from the barrel is half of what is present in previous Beretta’s semi-autos.\n \n \n \nCOMPANY FACTS: \n \n- Recoil with the A400 has been reduced by a massive 70%. \n-All-load top performance (24g - 64g) \n-It boasts the world’s fastest firing and recycling time - 36% faster than any other semi-auto out there.\n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DSCF1404.jpg[/IMG] \n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DSCF1409.jpg[/IMG] \n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/FULL.jpg[/IMG] \n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/DISMNTLD.jpg[/IMG] \n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/fullwithbirds.jpg[/IMG] \n \n \n \nTechnical Specifications:\n \nCategory: Firearms-- Shotgun\nMake: Beretta A400 Xplor Unico \nType: Gas-operated semi automatic\nGauge: 12 \nChamber: 3 inches\nCapacity: 3+1\nBarrel Length: 28 inches. \nWeight: 6.6 pounds \nChoke: Three Optima choke tubes included \nSights: Vent rib w/front bead \nStock: Oil-finished X-tra Grain walnut wood\nFinish: Green anodized receiver, blued-steel barrel.\n \n \nPacking:\n \nXplor comes in a beautiful green plastic carry case of superior quality.

Beginning with select walnut, Beretta uses a proprietary process called X-tra Grain to enhance the grain, and it''s really effective. \n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/BUTT.jpg[/IMG] \n \n \n \nAction & Barrel:\n \nThe barrel is made from a new material which Beretta call ‘Steelium’ (a very tough modern steel) and for which they claim all sorts of advantages. The feed system on the A400 has also been modified. The new gun will digest High Performance steel shot as well as regular lead loads.\n \nUnlike other commercial steel, these barrels are deep-drilled and cold-hammer forged in a production line with nine hammering machines. \n \nOne of the shortest receivers on the market - and it''s colored green! \n \nXplor features the third generation of Beretta’s Optima Bore High Performance (HP) barrels and Beretta Optima Choke HP choke tubes that work with traditional lead shot, standard steel shot and high performance steel shot. \n \nA ring between the barrel and receiver is designed to reduce barrel vibration and enhance pellet pattern.\n \n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/RECEIVER2.jpg[/IMG] \n \n \n \nTrigger:\n \nThe trigger is smooth and crisp \n \n \nBalance and Recoil:\n \nUnico''s recoil reduction system comprises of three shock absorbers - one fitted to the inner stock bolt and the other two contained within the stock and recoil pad.\n \nThe KO3 is a small hydraulic cylinder in the butt stock that the bolt intentionally impacts at the end of its travel, providing shock absorption and cushioning that no plastic bolt buffer can provide. \n \nI must admit that it has a very soft recoil, that of a 20 Gauge. \n \n \n[IMG]http://i970.photobucket.com/albums/ae189/azamkakar/BUTTSCOK3.jpg[/IMG]\n \n \n \nSights:\n \nFront Sight: Metal bead.\n \n \n \nMagazine:\n \nThe Magazine capacity is 3+1.

(337100, 'Review: Zigana T (Law Enforcement); Review: Zigana T (Law Enforcement); Salams, \n \nFor quite some time I have been seeing the Zigana T (LEA) version at the range. It''s very much like the normal Zigana except everything :) \n \nThe LEA version as I understand were imported in limited quantities and were made to a much higher spec than the normal Zigana. The first difference is that these pistols were built for sustained auto fire. The metallurgy, parts and machining are excellent and there is a marked difference when compared to the semi auto version. Before I go on I must mention that although built for auto fire the one I have is a semi auto. \n \nThe pistol has a 5.1 inch barrel and weighs around 1000 g which is slightly less than twice the Glock 17''s weight. In this gun however the weight adds to the functionality instead of being a negative. The gun has an ambidextrous safety for cocked and locked carry mode which also acts as a decocker when moved further. The sights are fixed and rather large, I would have much preferred that this gun comes with adjustable sights. It comes with a Houge like wrap around grip which makes the gun quite comfortable to hold and the slide release control is easy to use and always accessible due to it''s large size. The magazine release button is unobtrusive/works well and the magazines drop out smoothly. The gun comes with two high capacity magazines holding 20 rounds each. Disassembly is simple akin the Beretta/Taurus 92/99. \n \nThe slide and frame fit is exceptionally good and the finish is quite pleasing. What really makes this gun exceptional however is the single action trigger, it''s lovely & razor precise and pulls at the exact right moment every time. The single action pull should be around 3 pounds while double action is around a solid 10 pounds. I must mention again that the trigger is fantastic and can be compared to CZ''s Omega trigger system. The gun itself is very accurate, stays steady in your hands and is a joy to shoot. \n \nI took it to the range today for some testing and this is one of those guns that ensure you go back home smiling. \n \nSome pictures and range results. Targets were shot at 15 M.\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana1.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana2.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana3.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana4.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana6.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana5.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana7.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana8.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigana9.jpg[/IMG]\n \nThe last target was shot by Mr. Faisal Azad of LRC. \n \n[B]Verdict: Great gun, joy to own.[/B]\n \n[SIZE=2]On an ending note I would like to mention that I have heard some people making these pistol auto by installing an auto switch.

(337104, 'The New Taurus 709 Slim Subcompact Review; The New Taurus 709 Slim Subcompact Review; Salams,\n \nFor the past couple of months I have shifted my attention to subcompacts from compacts and full frame pistols for carry. My ideal conceal carry gun needs to have the primary quality of making me forget that I am actually carrying it. Over the past two years I tried carrying the Walther PP, Akdal Mini06, Canik Compact, Glock 26, Glock 19, PT 909, Cz Duty and Cz Rami but all made their presence felt while sitting down or driving. Holsters did help lessen the carry feeling and weight distribution but in turn made themselves felt.\n \nThen I found the newly launched PT 709 from Taurus''s [I]SLIM[/I] series. Holding this little pistol for the first time I was amazed at it''s slim profile and features. It''s is DA/SA, has a 3 inch barrel, holds 7+1 rounds and weighs around 540 grams. The sights are semi adjustable, there is loaded chamber indicator and an external key locking mechanism found on most Taurus pistols.\n \nPictures:\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami1.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami2.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami3.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami4.jpg[/IMG]\n \n \nAs you can see from the pics, this little gun is heavily influenced by Glocks. The take down is similar as found on Glocks and Taurus have incorporated a Glock like ''Safe Action'' trigger in the Slim. The safe action trigger, the firing pin block, the external safety and the key lock gives this little pistol an amazing [B]four [/B]safeties ! Ambidextrous thumb and finger placements are molded into the polymer frame, the trigger guard is extended and the grip is aggressively checkered to keep the pistol gripped firmly in your hands. \n \nThe mags are of good quality and load the 7 rounds without much fuss. They fit easy and drop free when loaded and partially when unloaded. The slide release (kinda hard) and sights (adjustable) are both average and nothing special.\n \nShooting the pistol for the first time took me by surprise as the single action trigger was insanely hard, so much so that I missed the 2x2 target altogether at 15 M. I have never shot such a hard single action trigger in my entire life. The double action pull was smooth at around 6 pounds, the S/A should have been around 4 ideally, instead it was around 14 pounds ! It took everyone at the range by surprise, the standard joke being a glass of orange juice and nuts being required after each trigger pull ;) \n \nThe trigger makes the gun useless for paper target shooting unless fixed to a more manageable pull. I tried shooting 4 targets with it to share with you guys but was so ashamed at the results that I did not take any pictures. I would normally say that I was having a bad shooting day but putting the Slim down after 5 shots I picked up my Glock 17 and shot a 97/100 at 15 M''s on the next target. I invited other shooters fire my pistol and share their opinions and everyone was hiding targets left right and center ;) \n \nThe recoil is also above average and after a few shots you notice a carbon copy of the grip checkering on your hands. As for ammo realibility, around 300 rounds of all kinds of ammo were put though the gun it did not misfire or fail to eject at all. The gun was shooting rather low for me so I took out a screwdriver and began adjusting the sights only to find that the low profile adjustable sight was already adjusted as high it could go. The loaded chamber indicator works but at the same time is not really very visible, the safe action trigger safety works well. \n \n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami8.jpg[/IMG]\n \nNow for comparing the the 709 to it''s main competitor, the CZ Rami !\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami5.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami6.jpg[/IMG]\n \n \n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami9.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami10.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami11.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/709vsRami12.jpg[/IMG]\n \nThe finish of both guns is good, but the Rami wins in all categories across the board like:\n \n1). Accuracy (Rami is insanely more accurate, infact giving most full frame pistols a run for their money)\n2). Sights (Rami has Tru Dot / Tritium Sights)\n3). Grip (Rami has Rubber grips which are also wide giving a better grip on the gun).\n4). Recoil (Rami''s additional weight (200 grams more) better grips and double recoil spring give it much softer recoil)\n5). Capacity (Rami holds 10 or 14 rounds to Slim''s 7)\n6). Firing System (I always rate hammer fired pistols over striker fired ones)\n7). Trigger (Rami has a much better DA/SA trigger)\n8). Heritage (Rami is a CZ, do I need to say more)\n \nThe Slim on the other hand has a few points over the Rami:\n \n1). Safeties (Slim has 4 vs Rami''s 1 (only firing pin block), decocker doesn''t count)\n2). Take Down (Slim is much easier to disassemble than the Rami. Took me 5 secs to disassemble the Slim vs 30 secs for the Rami) \n3). Weight (Slim is lighter than the Rami which weighs as much as full frame Glock 17!)\n4). Profile (Slim has a well... Slim profile making it much easier to carry)\n5). Snag (The Slim is a really snag free pistol, will explain more below)\n6). Ease of Carry (The Slim wins)\n7). Price (1xRami = 2x709''s)\n \nIt was obvious the Rami is a much better gun, but I tried to put it to my own little test which has more marks for me than any other. I should forget that I am carrying the gun. To test it out I was leaving for Islamabad a few days back and I took both guns with me. I put the Rami in my jeans pocket and started the drive to Isb, every 5 mins I would fidget and adjust the pistol, looking down I could see the pistol outline clearly through the fabric. The metal gun also felt cold and heavy. After about 30 mins I just got tired, took it from my pocket and placed it in my car. \n \nOn the way back, I put the Slim in my jeans pocket and within 10 minutes I had forgotten that I was carrying. Infact when I reached Lahore, had tea and gup shup for two hours, then a family member asked me if I bought anything new, I responded by saying yes I did and it''s in my car. Then I remembered that I had put the Slim in my pocket when leaving Isb, patted my jeans and there it was ! That is what I call a carry gun, it was in my pocket for 5+ hours and I completely forgot about it.\n \nI should also say that removing the Rami from one''s pocket and removing the Slim from one''s pocket are two very different experiences. The Rami''s slide rail edges get stuck in fabric, the sights as you can see from the pictures above are quite high profile and get stuck routinely, the dovetail grip also sticks and so does the magazine butt plate. The Slim is another matter, everything that I outlined causing a hindrance to drawing the gun is not there, look at the 2nd and 4th pictures from the top and compare. Doing a little gun withdraw from pocket test, I could pull the Slim out in under 2 secs while the Rami took around 5 secs. \n \n[U][B]Conclusion:[/B][/U]\n \nThe Rami is the better gun but the Slim is good alternative in a much more economical budget. The trigger issues if present can be fixed by spending Rs. 1000 which can be counted towards the cost of the gun.\n \nFor me forgetting I am carrying is the most important thing. If the gun is reliable enough, 7+1 rounds of 9mm hollow points are enough to take care of any business.', 'The New Taurus 709 Slim Subcompact Review'),

I opted for the .22 LR as I already have a wide variety of .22 ammo stockpiled. \n \nBefore buying I checked out atleast 5 other pieces and all had different triggers. The one I bought had the softest so I went for it. The Mini is a really great gun to hold, fits snugly in your hand. The plastic grip and the upwards curving magazine plate secure the pistol in your hand firmly. With a normal pistol three fingers hold the weapon grip whereas with the Mini there is only space for a two finger grip, but it is secure and comfortable. The pistol is the most point able weapon I have ever held simply because it is so small that with your finger on the trigger the pistol ends 4 centimeters from it. \n \nThe build quality is decent and the gun feels quite solid at 500g. Just as a side note and to appreciate Glocks I would like to mention that the weight of the full size Glock 17 is 625g ! The Mini holds 8+1 rounds although the 8th round fits so tight in the magazine that I doubt even cocking the slide will chamber it. \n \nThe gun itself has a 2.5 inch fixed barrel, fixed iron sights which are part of the pistol and is hammer fired. There is no slide realize or decocker and the pistol dis assembly latch also serves as a manual safety to carry in ''cocked and locked'' mode :cool:\n \nAfter fiddling around and reading the manual multiple times I could [B]not[/B] disassemble the pistol. It''s not complicated infact very simple, the dis assembly lug [U]should [/U]popout like the Canik''s / CZ75''s but it does not. \n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/7_resize-1.jpg[/IMG]\n \nApart from that there''s nothing much to say about this little pistol except you can carry it around in your pocket and forget it''s there. I will test it at the range InshAllah this coming weekend. It should be interesting as most rimfire (.22) pistols are ammo sensitive. It sells for 25 K.', 'Akdal Mini 06 Pictures and Review'),
(337107, 'New: ISSC M22 Finally Reviewed; ISSC M22 Finally Reviewed; Salams,\n \nFor a quite a while the ISSC Glock 19 lookalike M22 had been tantalizing us all with it''s build quality, Glock heritage, ''Made in Austria'' stamp and light weight. I had been looking for a chance to review one but did not know anyone who owned one. Today a friend lent me his new M22 to test to my desire and satisfaction !\n \nAs this is not a major item and is mostly a curio, I will keep the review short. \n \nThe pistol feels really nice to hold, the grip angle is good, the finish is clean. Very pointable, sights are Glock like, the trigger is identical to Glock''s ''Safe Action'' and functions fine. The pull is not crisp and very average. Disassembly seems Glock like as well but I could not get it open (to be fair did not read the manual, was in a hurry to test it). In all you feel like you''re handling a quality pistol and it will shoot the crap out of everything. \n \nWell, that''s where the good news ends, it doesn''t. It simply fails to perform. I started the test with three different types of ammo. Eley Club, Eley Sport, Armscor (not pictured) and Federal GameShok. All misfired without exception. In firing about 100 rounds or 10 ten mags, not one was without FTF or FTE. Often I had to use a flat screwdriver to pull empty shells stuck in the barrel a few times as well. The firing pin strikes were haywire and not consistent at all. The ISSC was a big disappointment for me as I was expecting it to work well and certainly much better than my Akdal Mini 06. Compared the Mini06 would win in about every department, size, concealment, accuracy, reliability, beauty and price.\n \nIt started retailing for around 70 K but is now selling for a final price of 45 K.\n \n \n[B]Verdict: Good looking Trash.[/B] \n \n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC1_resize.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC2_resize.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC3_resize.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC4_resize.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC5_resize.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/ISSC6_resize.jpg[/IMG]\n \nOn the above target I was aiming dead center. The shots all landed wherever they felt like :) I thought perhaps I was having a bad day and borrowed two shots from Starfish''s 9mm Zigana who was shooting at the next table. Both landed in 10 as can be seen on the target. Picked up the ISSC again and got the same wild shots again.

(337109, 'My New Ultrasonic Gun Cleaner !; My New Ultrasonic Gun Cleaner !; For the past few weeks I was looking into Ultrasonic cleaning for my guns. The Ultrasonic gun cleaners I found online were quite expensive starting from about $ 200 and extending upwards of $ 1000. Cleaning liquid availability was also an issue since it would be inconvenient to have it imported on a regular basis. Reading Denovo''s post the other day in the Ultrasonic article thread, I thought the surgical shops might have some thing I could use. So off I went to the most convenient store and asked the owner if he had an Ultrasonic cleaner, he told me no and had never heard of such a thing. I was a little disappointed but after a few trips to Sitara market one learns to keep an eye out for something the shop keeper does not realize he has. I saw a dusty little box lying in a corner shelf and asked to see it. It turned out to be exactly what I was looking for, an Ultrasonic Cleaner ! The owner was a little confused as he struggled to remember it and after ruffling through some documents sold it to me for Rs. 4000. I then asked him if he had any sterilizing liquid and checked a few makes till I found one that catered to Ultrasonic equipment. A 150ml bottle of it cost me Rs. 500. \n \nBack home I could not wait to try my new cleaner. Since it was a first, I was a little hesitant to put my expensive gun barrels in it but then remembered a rusty almost junk local made Beretta 92fs barrel lying around. I had wasted a few hours on this barrel some time back trying to clean it using all conventional methods of rust removal / cleaning like hot water & soap, diesel, rust remover, mitti ki tail, Hoppes, WD40, gun oil and brass brushes but all had failed. I thought what better and more difficult test could I put to my new Ultrasonic cleaner.

Five runs later I took the barrel out not knowing what to expect. At first glance I was surprised at how clean the barrel looked and felt from outside. As I lifted it some rust poured out of the barrel into the cloth I was holding it with, I looked inside the barrel and was more than surprised. Ran two clean patches though the barrel with a barrel brush and here are the results.\n \nThe patches:\n \n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Ultrasonic10.jpg[/IMG]\n \nCan you believe this ???

(337150, ' The original .357 Magnum cartridge used a large pistol primer and was designed to launch a 125 grain bullet at around 1600-1650 fps from a 6 inch barrel. Modern .357 Magnum Cartridges use small pistol primers, and pressures have been reduced to allow only about 1250-1350 fps from the same weapon. The reason for this is probably that gun manufacturers began making light frame revolvers in this caliber, and ammunition manufacturers reduced the pressure to avoid potential law suits.', ''),

(337153, ' I see a lot of interesting opinions. There are a few that... well, let''s just say [I]I may not understand completely[/I].\n\nWith any firearm, people use more effectively that which is more comfortable for them. What suits you may not suit me. \n\nAs far as hunting dangerous animals (I saw bear and boar mentioned) I would use a rifle of caliber between .308 and .375 H&H for bear, with a handgun only as backup. While it is possible to kill a bear or a boar with a handgun, there are better tools out there for that job, called rifles.\n\nFor self defense, it is not only the weapon that is important, but also the ammunition. For my 4 .357''s (3 revolvers and a rifle) I have more than 10 different loads, depending on what i need to do. In my taurus 651, I carry 125 grain Federal Hydrashok ammo for defending myself against people. It may sound cruel, but THAT round was designed to shoot people. In my rifle, I use Hornady 180 grain solid hardcast lead bullets for deer. The difference: The Federal round will create an enormous wound-channel, it will deform, and will penetrate up to 18 inches through heavy clothing. The shock delivered will stop an attacker even if it does not kill him outright. In effect, it turns everything to mush. For deer, the hardcast bullet will not deform as much, it will penetrate deeply, through the animal, and create a wound that would bleed out rapidly (both sides). I don''t care if I damage the human attacker''s meat, because I will not eat him. The deer, I will eat, so the less damage to the meat, the better.\n\nIn many cases FMJ (full metal jacket) bullets in semi-autos,  were found to be more effective against attackers wearing thick clothing, than hollow point ammo that slow down far more on impact as the thick clothes absorb energy.\n\nOne member mentioned that bullets only expand at higher velocity. That is true. A hollow point that flies at 800 or 900fps will not expand to a noticeable degree when hitting flesh. That does not mean that a 240 gr. .45 ACP is not an effective man-stopper. Look at it this way: if an air rifle pellet hits you at 200fps, will it kill you? If a brick hits you at the same velocity, that changes the dynamics, right? The .45 bullet is roughly twice the weight of the "standard" .357 bullet. Even though it is considerably slower, I doubt that anyone who gets one center-mass would be able to tell the difference.\n\nThe most underrated, and most crucial point in self defence is to be able to function effectively. The only way to do that is to be practiced with your weapon. As important is your mindset. If you cannot prepare yourself mentally to kill your attacker, you need to sell your gun and buy a tazer. Practice, practice, practice. In a stressful situation, the person who does what is practiced a thousand times will ALWAYS be more effective.\n\nPractice drawing. Remember, slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. Don''t try to be Billy the Kid. Just be smooth. The more practice, the faster you become. Reload. Practice reloading. After a while you would be doing it without having to think. Remedial action, or clearing stoppages. Practice. Think of it this way: A man who has a saw and wood tools is not a carpenter. A man who KNOWS how to use them is.\n\nAs a preference, I prefer the .357. My guns fit my hands better, and and I reload my own ammo in that caliber, so shooting them is cheaper. That does not mean that I think it is better than a .45. Only that it is better for me.', ''),

Modern .357 Magnum Cartridges use small pistol primers, and pressures have been reduced to allow only about 1250-1350 fps from the same weapon.

(337266, ' [QUOTE=Turumti;105912]\nOne chap who is quite experienced in this calibre told me you need to find the right ammo (sniper grade) to shoot accurately with this gun. He said to stay away from the older Berdan primed ammo, which leaves corrosive residue in the barrel and causes rust and pitting.[/QUOTE]\n\nI own 2 Mosin Nagants, a M44 and a 91/30 and I shoot the corrosive Czech Silvertips and Bulgarian Yellowtips all the time. The trick is in how you clean the rifle. The cause is the old primers used different chemicals, and when fired, they cause corrosive salts to be deposited in the chamber and barrel. Modern cleaning solvents are oil-based, so they do not dissolve these salts (they are water-soluble). First strip down the bolt and clean thoroughly with window-cleaner. Use only a window-cleaner that does NOT contain ammonia! Clean the chamber and barrel with the window-cleaner. This dissolves and removes the salts. Dry off the bolt parts, chamber and barrel with clean, dry cleaning patches. Now start the cleaning process all over using your favourite cleaning solvent (I use Hoppes no. 9 and Boretech Eliminator). It is critical that the weapon be cleaned thoroughly as soon as possible after shooting. The next day is too late. Following this process will allow you to shoot cheap surplus ammo without damaging a rifle''s accuracy. One last point: When in doubt, clean as if it''s corrosive ammo. Many other WWII surplus calibers have corrosive surplus ammo still out there, like the Turkish 8mm Mauser (7.92) and .303 British ammo from the 1950s, to name a couple.\n\nHope this info helps.

Having said that 12Gauge is right - this company may be purchasing some parts from the Italian firm but that does NOT make it an Italian gun from that company because I used to own one cz from Tangfolio and it WAS AMAZING.  Its like the Stoeger company who has the license to make the gun from Beretta because Beretta was about to release the plastic version of the Cougar called the PX4 Storm.  However, one can see the differences between the Stoeger Cougar and the Beretta 8000 Cougar in the build quality, literally like comparing apples to oranges.  And simply owning a Stoeger Cougar one cannot state its Italian even though its magazines say Beretta on them.

[/B]\n\nIt has BC of 0.201 to  and an SD of 0.186 \n\nA  max velocity of  about 3500 ft per sec can be achieved with this bullet  and it is good for varmints  being very explosive and fast out to 300m  it is only good for jackals/coyotes \n\n[B]130 grain bullet[/B]\n\nThis  is best performer of the 270 bullets at long range it has a fairly good  BC of .412  with boat tail bullets and an SD of .242, this makes it  suitable for thin skinned animals and ideal for sheep like Urial, Gad  and Sindh Ibex\n\n[B]150 grain bullets[/B]\n\nThese have a good  BC of .489 with boat tail bullets and .455 with flat base.\nThese  can be fired at up to 2850 ft/sec when hand loaded  these are good for  most heavy boned thin skin animals like Himalayan Ibex and the Neel Gai (  Worlds second largest Antelope )\n\n[IMG]http://www.chuckhawks.com/270Win_copy.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[COLOR=#000040][B]Personnel views and Comments[/B][/COLOR]\n\nWhile  the 270 is a great cartridge but the 7mm has many more options in  bullet weights and shapes. The difference in bullet diameter is only  .007 ( 7mms .284 in, vs the .277 of the 270 ). The 7mm has from a 120 to  190 grain options with much higher BC and SD.\n\nMost 270s today  are with 22 inch barrels which further reduces the velocity some what  and in comparison the 7mm mag is much faster and even the 30-06 when  (hand loaded )\n\nIn Pakistan we have a very limited bullet choice  and I have seen people wound Neel Gai with several shots from a 270  firing 130 grain soft points, where as a heavier bullet like the 150  grain which is rarely available could have done the job with one  carefully placed shot. Shot placement is most important but a Neel Gai  big Male has a very tough skin and I have seen bullets not penetrating  past the shoulder into the lung cavity. Bullets placed behind the  shoulder angling towards the far shoulder  are very effective.\n\nAgain  although the .270 is an effective long range cartridge I have seen it  some what over shadowed by the 7mm Magnum when shooting the Himalayan  Ibex at long range.\n\nFor the biggest wild boars at least 150 grain bullets must be used.\nThe 130 gr bullet is the best all round long range performer on sheep and when the bullet weight is increased the trajectory suffers and it loses its long range potential. \nI find it handicapped on Himalayan Ibex and Neel Gai, so have many of my hunting buddies.\n\n  					\n\n 						 						 							 							[FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=4][URL="http://thegunforum.net/report.php?f=42&p=14860"][IMG]http://thegunforum.net/styles/RedSilver3/imageset/en/icon_post_report.gif[/IMG][/URL][/SIZE][/FONT]', ''),

In 1989, a fresh policy was circulated which suggested that instead of using pull through and cloth excessively to clean foul deposits in the barrel, we should use oil soacked cloth ( Chindi ) and allow it to work on deposits. It will soften the residue in time and then make it easier to remove. Excessive wear and tear of barrel will be avoided.

The romance with a rifle is a matter of individual choice,  but some parameters have to be considered. The size of the game to be taken, thick skinned or soft, does it talk back, what range it is generally taken. Considering these we will reach a conclusion that there is no ideal rifle / cal combination. \nFor non dangerous game starting from close to very long range the 7mm Rem Mag followed by 30-06 and the .270 seem to be close to the ideal caliber. for Africa nothing comes close to the venerable .375 H&H Magnum as an all around African cartridge. As far as rifles go I think every has his own choice .\nIn the .270 the best bullet is 130 grs, in the 30-06 the 165 and 180 grains are great and in the 7mm Rem Mag there is nothing to beat the 160 gr and the 175 grain bullets. In the .375 the 300 gr premium bullets are superb. Again I will submit these are individual choices and the performance required would determine the choice of bullet, when seeking best trajectory for an animal the size of an Urial 150 gr bullet in the O''6, and 7mm Mag would be fine, the 270 would only perform with a 130gr at long range. At long range when shooting a Himalayan Ibex going easily over 300 lbs + A 7mm Rem mag would do great with both the 160 and 150 gr bullets, the O''6 with 165 but the .270 would be handicapped with its 130gr in energy/penetration and its 150 or 140 grainers would lack the trajectory.\nThese observations are based on a number of observations by a host of experienced hunters.', ''),

Rimfire cases  are constructed with the priming compound spun inside the rim of the  copper or brass case, which is crushed by the blow of the firing pin to  ignite the main powder charge.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The first rimfire cartridges were .22s, but after  the type became established many larger caliber rimfire cartridges were  developed in the mid to late 19th Century.  Some of these had a good run  of popularity until they were superceded by the development of higher  pressure centerfire ammunition.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Calibers ranged from the .25 Short to the .58  Miller.  Probably the best known of the larger caliber rimfires are the  .25 Stevens, .32 Long, and .44 Henry Flat.  The latter was the cartridge  for which the seminal Henry and Winchester 1866 "Yellow Boy" lever  action rifles were chambered.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Guns and ammunition for the last of the larger  caliber rimfires was discontinued in the U.S. in the late 1930''s and  early 1940''s.  According to [I]Cartridges of the World[/I] by Frank C.  Barnes/Edited by M.L. McPherson, for which I am indebted for much of the  historical information in this article, Navy Arms commissioned a run of  .32 Long ammunition from a Brazilian manufacturer in 1990.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]In addition to the larger caliber rimfire  cartridges of the past, in recent times sub-caliber rimfire cartridges  have been introduced.  Among these are the 5mm Remington Magnum, .17  Mach 2, and the very successful .17 HMR.  However, the focus of this  article is .22 caliber rimfire cartridges.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]All .22 rimfires (except the WRF and WMR) are  ancient black powder designs, and use tapered heel bullets.  If you  examine a .22 S, L, or LR cartridge, you will see that the case and  bullet are the same diameter.  The part of the bullet inside of the case  (the heel) is reduced in diameter to allow it to fit inside of the  case.  Such bullets are also called "outside lubricated," because they  are ordinarily waxed or copper plated.  In all other modern cartridges,  the bullet shank is of constant diameter and the case is slightly larger  than the bullet to allow the heel of the latter to fit inside.  This  old fashioned term for this design is "inside lubricated," as the  lubrication grooves of lead bullets are inside of the case.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The BB Cap was the first type of rimfire  ammunition.  BB stands for "bullet breech."  It was invented in France  around 1845, designed for the Flobert indoor target rifle.  BB Caps were  designed for shooting gallery use and are seldom encountered these  days, as shooting galleries are now considered politically incorrect by  socialists, tort lawyers, girly men, and liberal politicians.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The BB Cap fires a round lead projectile (ball)  powered only by the priming compound in the rim of the case, which is  very short as no powder is used.  The case is just there to hold the  priming compound and bullet together.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]BB Caps were made in Europe and America until  fairly recently.  The last I saw were made in Germany by RWS who, I  believe, still loads them today.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The successor to the BB Cap was the CB Cap.  "CB"  stands for "Conical Bullet."  The CB cap uses a 29 grain round nose lead  bullet and a tiny pinch of powder.  This is also shooting gallery  ammunition.  CCI produces modern CB Cap loads in .22 Short and .22 Long  cases (firearms chambered for the Long Rifle cartridge being far more  common today) for gallery and indoor practice use.  The MV of either is  710 fps.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The common .22 Short cartridge dates from 1857.   It is the oldest cartridge still being loaded today.  It was the first  American metallic cartridge, introduced in for the first S&W  revolver, a pocket pistol developed for personal protection.  It was  popular during the American Civil War, carried as personal weapons by  soldiers on both sides.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 Short is a development of the BB cap using  a 29 grain round nose (RN) bullet in a lengthened case (compared to the  BB Cap).  It was originally powered by 4 grains of fine black powder  (about FFFFg).  After the advent of smokeless powder, the .22 short was  adapted to the new, cleaner burning propellant.  Although no longer  extremely popular, it is still used all over the world and in the  Olympic games for the rapid fire pistol event.  Modern .22 Short High  Velocity ammunition is loaded to a MV of approximately 1095 fps and ME  of 77 ft. lbs. from a rifle barrel (Remington figures).[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 Short is a pretty anemic round, and in  1871 a longer case of the same diameter was developed for the 29 grain  Short bullet.  This became the .22 Long cartridge, still occasionally  seen (but obsolescent) today.  The .22 Long was once chambered in a  large number of pistols and rifles.  It was originally loaded with 5.0  grains of very fine black powder and offered about 100+ fps greater  velocity than the .22 Short.  The Long survived the change to smokeless  powder and is still occasionally seen today.  CCI loads their .22 Long  High Velocity ammo to a MV of 1215 fps and ME of 95 ft. lbs.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Around 1880 the .22 Extra Long cartridge appeared,  powered by 6.0 grains of black powder.  It fired a 40 grain tapered  heel bullet (the same as the later .22 Long Rifle) at a MV similar to  the Long Rifle, but used a longer case than the .22 LR.  This cartridge  was available in a number of rifles in the late 19th Century.  .22 Extra  Long ammunition was finally discontinued around 1935.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]In 1887 the Stevens Arms Co. developed the  ultimate in .22 rimfire cartridges, the .22 Long Rifle.  This used the  .22 Long case with a 40 grain RN bullet loaded to higher velocity than  the 29 grain Long bullet.  It shot flatter and hit harder than any of  the previous .22 rimfires except the .22 Extra Long, whose performance  it essentially duplicated in a shorter case, and it was more accurate  than that cartridge.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 Long Rifle caught on, was adapted to both  rifles and pistols, and became the most popular sporting and target  shooting cartridge in the world.  After the advent of smokeless powder a  High Velocity version of the .22 LR was introduced, which further  extended the .22 LR''s superiority as a small game hunting cartridge.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Modern .22 LR target ammunition is loaded to a MV  of about 1085 fps with a 40 grain RN bullet.  .22 Long Rifle High  Velocity cartridges drive a 40 grain copper-plated bullet at a MV of  1255 fps and ME of 140 ft. lbs. from a rifle barrel.  For small game  hunters, most manufacturers offer a 36-37 grain copper-plated lead  hollow point bullet at about 1280 fps (Remington figures).  This load  expands nicely and makes for quick kills on small game, given proper  bullet placement.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Because of its popularity there are many  permutations of the .22 LR cartridge.  One of the more useless is the  .22 LR shot cartridge, which fires a pinch of very fine #12 shot.  This  load is used, among other things, to collect very small creatures, mice  and the like, for museum displays.  This is not a hunting load, as it is  ineffective for use even on very small birds beyond about 10 feet.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Far more useful are the Hyper Velocity .22 LR  loads pioneered by CCI in the form of the Stinger.  These use  lightweight hollow point bullets at increased velocity for flatter  trajectory and dramatic expansion.  Remington followed suit with their  famous Yellow Jacket load, and the idea was subsequently picked-up by  most other manufacturers.  The CCI Stinger drives a 32 grain GLHP bullet  at a MV of 1640 fps with 191 ft. lbs. of ME.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]In 1890 the .22 Winchester Rim Fire (WRF) was  introduced.  This cartridge is loaded with a 45 grain, flat point,  inside lubricated bullet with a full diameter heel, rather than the  tapered heel bullet of the .22 LR.  The .22 WRF fires a .224" diameter  bullet, just like modern centerfire .22s and the later .22 Magnum (WMR).   At one time a 40 grain HP bullet was also available, but it has since  fallen by the wayside.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Remington called this cartridge the .22 Remington  Special, and loaded it with a 45 grain RN bullet.  The .22 Rem. Spec.  and .22 WRF are the same cartridge and are interchangeable.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 WRF is a good small game cartridge,  superior to the .22 LR.  CCI loads the ammunition, and Winchester does  an occasional run of .22 WRF.  Modern CCI ammo is loaded to a MV of 1300  fps and ME of 169 ft. lbs.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Today the .22 WRF is kept alive primarily as a  less destructive small game load for rifles chambered for the .22 WMR  cartridge.  The .22 Magnum is a lengthened version of the .22 WRF and  will chamber in firearms designed for the .22 WMR, much as .38 Special  ammunition may be fired from .357 Magnum guns, although it will not  function correctly in autoloaders.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]In the early 20th Century a pair of cartridges  about the same size and offering about the same ballistics as the .22 LR  were introduced.  These were designed for use in autoloading rifles,  used smokeless powder and inside lubricated bullets, and in that respect  are a more modern design than the .22 LR.  However, as soon as the  established .22 LR was universally converted to smokeless powder, the  .22 Auto cartridges became superfluous.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 Winchester Automatic cartridge was  designed for their Model 1903 autoloading rifle (discontinued in 1932).   Ammo was produced into the 1970''s.  Remington''s .22 Automatic appeared  in their Model 16 autoloader.  That rifle was discontinued in 1928, and  the ammunition was not loaded after the Second World War.  Although  similar, these two cartridges differ dimensionally and are [I]not[/I] interchangeable.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Jump to 1959, the year Winchester introduced their  very successful .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR).  This cartridge  pushes the limits of pressure possible with a rimfire case given the  limits of contemporary metallurgy.  The .22 Magnum was initially offered  with 40 grain FMJ and JHP bullets at an advertised MV of 2000 fps from a  rifle barrel and 1550 fps from a pistol barrel.  Due to its high  velocity, .22 WMR cartridges are loaded with jacketed bullets.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 WMR is based on a lengthened version of  the .22 WRF case, like that cartridge uses standard diameter .224"  inside lubricated bullets, and remains to this day the most powerful .22  rimfire cartridge ever.  It has been adapted to many types and brands  of firearms, and .22 WMR ammunition is loaded by all of the major  rimfire ammunition manufacturers and is very widely distributed.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]As good as the .22 WMR is as a rifle cartridge, I  feel that it is even better as a revolver cartridge.  It offers velocity  and trajectory similar to the centerfire magnum pistol cartridges at a  fraction of the recoil and cost.  Convertible revolvers, supplied with  both .22 LR and .22 WMR cylinders, are the ultimate in versatility for  plinking, small game hunting, and varmint shooting.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Today the .22 WMR is available with bullet weights  ranging from about 30 to 50 grains, and CCI loads a shot shell version.   The standard Winchester 40 grain JHP bullet is now loaded to a rifle  MV of 1910 fps with ME of 324 ft. lbs.  The various 30-40 grain JHP  bullets are best for varmint hunting, but are overly destructive on  small game intended for the dinner table.  A better choice in that case  are the heavier 45-50 grain bullets intended for small game hunting, or  the use of .22 WRF ammo when possible.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]The .22 WMR is the newest, commercially  successful, .22 rimfire cartridge (so far).  With .22 rimfire cartridges  now available from the BB Cap to the WMR, the field seems pretty well  covered.  Recent rimfire development has concentrated on lighter,  smaller caliber bullets that can achieve higher velocity within the  existing pressure limits.  The .17 HMR, based on a necked-down .22  Magnum case, is the best example.[/FONT]\r\n  [FONT=Arial]Rimfire cartridge design is limited by the fact  that the brass case rim must be weak enough to be crushed by the blow of  the firing pin.  This severely limits the permissible maximum pressure  and thus the performance of the cartridge.  I suspect that the advent of  more potent .22 rimfire cartridges will depend on the future  development of more advanced case materials.

Here are the pics from day.\r\n\r\nWe hunted a very big lake, my blind was on edge on one side of lake but it was surrounded with knee deep water from all side. I had to take a small boat to get there.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/DSCN3537.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/DSCN3541.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nWhen I was in position, I had to wait for the fisrt fire that is shot by the host after everyone is in position. Once you hear the shot you can start firing.

(337613, ' My humble apologies, Mr. Kakar. I re-read your original post, and it states that you bought woodlands camo duct tape. Then it says you applied a gunsock to the scattergun. I got it all screwed up. You see, I was all nervous because I had just come from a little shoot where we fired 155mm artillery pieces out of the shoulder, and threw nukes at each other in fun. I thought I saw a PakGuns mod hiding in the bushes, and I thought I might be banned. In my nervousness I misread your post. Again, I apologise.\n\nDo you buy a lot of toys from the US? I live in Tennessee, and I can tell you that you could get a lot of that stuff cheaper elsewhere. I do business with Cabelas, Spotrsman''s guide, Dixie Gunworks, Numrich, Brownell''s, Midway and many more. Sometimes stuff is cheaper on Amazon! I don''t do e-bay for anything because of their head-up-their-a.... I mean, head-in-the-sand attitude towards firearms. I think you probably have the same kind of intellectual giants in Pak. The people who try to tell you that the more defenseless you are, the safer you are, but when the paw-paw hits the fan, they are the ones expecting you to protect them.\n\nYou did get some nice goodies, and if you want, the next time you order from the US, PM me what you want, and I''ll tell you who has the best prices. I know it''s a pain to order from multiple places, but a buck saved is a buck earned.\n\n[U]To the powers that be:[/U]\nThe mod that took pictures of me shooting cannons and throwing nukes photoshopped those pics.

OK ok on a serious note, the viper from what I recall was an ok gun, nothing special, a gun of this category in my opinion is a deal if priced at about 30k max. no more as thats what its build quality looked/felt like to me.  \n12Gauge bhai, you need to stop... again you had me laughing.  Having said that 12Gauge is right - this company may be purchasing some parts from the Italian firm but that does NOT make it an Italian gun from that company because I used to own one cz from Tangfolio and it WAS AMAZING.  Its like the Stoeger company who has the license to make the gun from Beretta because Beretta was about to release the plastic version of the Cougar called the PX4 Storm.  However, one can see the differences between the Stoeger Cougar and the Beretta 8000 Cougar in the build quality, literally like comparing apples to oranges.  And simply owning a Stoeger Cougar one cannot state its Italian even though its magazines say Beretta on them.  Or for that fact, Taurus PT owners can''t claim that they own a Beretta because Forjas Taurus purchased the existing Beretta plant in Brazil!![/QUOTE]\n\nDear Moeen Bro , very nice explanation, and what u think how viper is compared to pt99 and stoeger, and is that apples to apples....??', ''),

(337720, ' [QUOTE=Gilani;129180]IMHO, the list needs a bit of change. We are talking about pistols with historical background, aren''t we? So this does not necessarily has to be a good handgun from performance point of view, however, it must have some historical significance like being very old, having remained the sidearm of many armies, having beein used in some extraordinay historical event or having survived in the market for a long time etc etc. \n\nIf we consider the above, only Walther PPK and Makarov deserve to stay in the list. Sig P226, CZ75 and Beretta 92fs, though amonst the best ever pistols, are relatively newer models and do not have a historical significance per se. Cougar has never been included amongst the world best and is hardly historical. Smith & Wesson, well yes, but which model of S&W? Unless we specify the model, it would not be possible to comment. \n\nMany of the historical handguns fulfilling the above crieteria are revolvers. So any list of historical handguns would not be complete without Colt SA Army revolvers, Nagant revolvers, Webley and Scott revolvers etc. \n\nHowever, if we are talking about the pistols only, than in my view, as already pointed out by many members, Colt 1911 (not the newly manufactured 1911 clones), Browning HiPower, TT33, Luger and few others need to be included in the list. \n\nOut of the above, Browning Hipower has the honour of being the official sidearm of more than 20 armies of the world for around half a century, followed by Makarov and TT-33. Walther PP/ PPK has been one of the most popular CC handgun for 60-70 years and has been used by many celeberaties. Colt 1911, conversely, has been used mostly by US Army only, however, due to media dominance of US, has been able to get maximum publicity. It surely has the honour of being the most widely manufactured handgun in the world.  \n\nI would personally rate Browning HiPower, Walther PPK, Makarov and Colt 1911 amonst the handguns which will always have a significant place in the history of pistols. :)[/QUOTE]\n \n\n+1 thanks gillani sb  , but as if the list TT-33 bro have mentioned its Makarov with the most stories to know from history...', ''),

The formal inauguration of the center in Islamabad is awaited, but Nadra has commenced processing of already pending applications and about 4100 arms licenses of both prohibited and non-prohibited bore are ready to be delivered.\r\n\r\nNadra has received the circular prohibiting possession of more than 500 bullets or cartridges, and consequently delivery of arms licenses can commence. The pilot project in which arms licenses would be issued to people recommended by Parliamentarians has started and a principal has been set under which the prime minister will recommend the issuance of prohibited bore licenses, while the Interior Ministry will grant permission for non-prohibited bore licenses.\r\n\r\nGiving details of the procedures for obtaining arms licenses, Nadra sources said that one has to submit an application along with a recommendatory note from a parliamentarian. The application would be passed through procedural checks and bio-metric checks and then an E-form would be generated that would be sent to the Prime Minister Secretariat for prohibited bore and to Interior Ministry for non-prohibited bore for final approval.\r\n\r\nAfter clearance a demand note would be issued to applicant for purchase of required weapon, which would be registered and then a license card would be issued. Sources in the Interior Ministry said that in the first phase licenses would be issued on recommendations made by parliamentarians, but they would also be made accountable and their digital signatures would be taken to avoid any misuse of the facility. The database of Nadra will not allow any cheating in obtaining the arms licenses.\r\n\r\nNadra sources said that the system developed for arms licenses would be audit traceable and many security features were added to help the government and law enforcement agencies identify the owner of a weapon when deemed necessary. The present arms license system has many loopholes and one cannot determine whether the license holder is a real person or not.\r\n\r\nNadra made all arrangements to start the operation, and purchase necessary equipment and developed bio-metric software to entertain applications of people seeking arms licenses, sources said, adding that the bio-metric software was developed in a way to ensure that no one can replicate the license. This would ensure transparency, which will help in maintaining law and order in the country and bring the high crime rate down.\r\n\r\nBearing arms is not a necessity, Nadra sources maintained, and hence processing fees will be higher than the prevailing fee structure and a person who wants to avail this facility should have to spend money without seeking a concession. Nadra will set up a main center at G-10 sector of Islamabad and later one center each would be opened at provincial headquarters of Nadra. Sources aver that there is no need of establishing a large number of offices to over-burden the Nadra system and people who want license must travel to obtain this facility', ''),

It could be Ceska copying the CZ name not Zastava who adopted this name 80 years earlier.   \n\nCrvena Zastava has now changed their name to Zastava Arms, however, they still use the name CZ for some of their old models like CZ999 but the newer models have EZ or such like names. I wont therefore agree that they are taking the advantage of CZ name, specially when they are not using CZ with their newer models like EZ9 which is essentially the same guns as CZ999.\n[/QUOTE]\n\nInteresting discussion going on here, not really required but since this has been discussed many times before and everyone has misconceptions let me clarify the origins of [B]Zastava[/B] and [B]CZ[/B] and which of the two has the right be to called the "[B]Original CZ[/B]".\n\nA little bit of history first: (Will try to keep it short).\n\nA factory called "[B]Vojno-Tehnicki Zavod[/B]" (Military-Technical Works) was founded in 1853 in [B]K[/B]ragujevac (which is a city in Serbia/Yugoslavia) to mainly produce cannons but later started manufacturing all things military. After WWII it was renamed to Arms Factory of Brigades of Yugoslavian partisans ([B]NOVJ[/B]) and next year to  [B]Military-Technical Workshops[/B] and then to [B] Military-Technical Works[/B]. A year after in [B]1945[/B] it was again renamed to [B]Crvena Zastava[/B], after which all it''s products have been sold under the "[B]Zastava[/B]" brand name and never CZ.\n\nAs for CZ of the CZ-75 fame, that company was founded in 1919 under the name of "[B]Jiho&#269;eská zbrojovka[/B]" or (South Bohemian Armament Works). It merged with two other companies in 1922 and renamed to [B]Czech Armament Works[/B]. In [B]1935/36[/B] this company launched products under the [B]CZ[/B] brand name and has been using it since. All products of this company since 1935 have been stamped [B]CZ[/B] and sold under the "[B]CZ[/B]" brand name.\n\nI think the little write up above should have clarified that the CZ brand name has been in use by the CZ75 company about a [B]decade [/B]longer than the name Crvena Zastava started to be used.\n\nNow as far as the CZ 999 being called a CZ, that is a simple matter. It''s just a model name rather than a brand name, CZ999''s have the company name "[B]Zastava[/B]" stamped on all of them and "[B]CZ 999 Skorpion[/B]" as model.\n\nIn the case of CZ of the CZ75 fame,"[B]CZ[/B]"is the company name stamped on the gun and "[B]75[/B]" is the model. \n\nThere is no confusion at all on the company end, [B]&#268;eská zbrojovka[/B] calls itself [B]CZ [/B]or [B]CZUB [/B]and [B]Crvena Zastava [/B]calls itself [B]Zastava Arms[/B].', ''),

(337782, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;176779]Interesting discussion going on here, not really required but since this has been discussed many times before and everyone has misconceptions let me clarify the origins of [B]Zastava[/B] and [B]CZ[/B] and which of the two has the right be to called the "[B]Original CZ[/B]".\n\nA little bit of history first: (Will try to keep it short).\n\nA factory called "[B]Vojno-Tehnicki Zavod[/B]" (Military-Technical Works) was founded in 1853 in [B]K[/B]ragujevac (which is a city in Serbia/Yugoslavia) to mainly produce cannons but later started manufacturing all things military. After WWII it was renamed to Arms Factory of Brigades of Yugoslavian partisans ([B]NOVJ[/B]) and next year to  [B]Military-Technical Workshops[/B] and then to [B] Military-Technical Works[/B]. A year after in [B]1945[/B] it was again renamed to [B]Crvena Zastava[/B], after which all it''s products have been sold under the "[B]Zastava[/B]" brand name and never CZ.\n\nAs for CZ of the CZ-75 fame, that company was founded in 1919 under the name of "[B]Jiho&#269;eská zbrojovka[/B]" or (South Bohemian Armament Works). It merged with two other companies in 1922 and renamed to [B]Czech Armament Works[/B]. In [B]1935/36[/B] this company launched products under the [B]CZ[/B] brand name and has been using it since. All products of this company since 1935 have been stamped [B]CZ[/B] and sold under the "[B]CZ[/B]" brand name.\n\nI think the little write up above should have clarified that the CZ brand name has been in use by the CZ75 company about a [B]decade [/B]longer than the name Crvena Zastava started to be used.\n\nNow as far as the CZ 999 being called a CZ, that is a simple matter. It''s just a model name rather than a brand name, CZ999''s have the company name "[B]Zastava[/B]" stamped on all of them and "[B]CZ 999 Skorpion[/B]" as model.\n\nIn the case of CZ of the CZ75 fame,"[B]CZ[/B]"is the company name stamped on the gun and "[B]75[/B]" is the model. \n\nThere is no confusion at all on the company end, [B]&#268;eská zbrojovka[/B] calls itself [B]CZ [/B]or [B]CZUB [/B]and [B]Crvena Zastava [/B]calls itself [B]Zastava Arms[/B].[/QUOTE]\n\n+1 Abbas Sb ......thats what i was going to say but didn''t knew until u said........hmm  ;-)', ''),

(337863, 'BAM B3-1 air rifle review My B3 Chinese air rifle arrived today. It is a solidly made rifle, and on intensive study appears to be new and unfired. While I do not expect a Feinwerkbau or Anschutz for $30, I am a little put off by the bright orange finish on the stock.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I tried to mount a scope on the dovetail mount. That took almost 3 hours, and the use of gunsmithing tools. The grooves on the rifle were NOT 3/8 inch. They were about 35 thou wider, so I had to mess with the clamps of the scope, but I got the job done while discussing with myself the ancestry of the idiot who cut those grooves.\r\n\r\nNext was to zero the scope. I placed a A4 size paper with a dot in the center at 30 meter, and fired the first shot. The rifle is advertised as shooting a .22 cal. pellet at 700-800 fps. That is a lie. I don''t have a chronograph at home, but I estimate the velocity at about 500 fps. Still not bad for a $30 air rifle, and enough for what I want it to do (kill squirrels that damage my house), but not what is advertised.\r\n\r\nI dailed the pellets in, and the shots were sort of consistant. At 30 meters I consistantly shoot 2 inch groups. Sure, not too bad for $30.  Nobody gets a Feinwerkbau at $30, right? Still, not the kind of accuracy a guy who shoots golf balls at 200 meters likes.\r\n\r\nLoading this rifle is something I am not used to. The underlever cocking rifles are more accurate than break-neck air rifles, but I am used to the loading-gate systems found on the Gecado/Diana or BSA rifles. This rifle requires the pellet to be inserted into the barrel while the lever is pulled to the rear, exposing the breech. Any failure of the mechanism while loading the pellet will result in the loss of at least one finger, unless the underlever us firmly held with one hand while loading the pellet with the other. Inserting the pellet is not easy. The BSA or Gecado rifles'' loading gate just requires dropping the pellet in, while this gun requires pushing the pellet directly into the breech.\r\n\r\nThe front sight of this rifle is attached with rivets. I will remove it, but only when I get to my workshop. Personally, I think a pair of retaining pins would have been enough.\r\n\r\nFor the price, not a bad buy, but not the rifle i would buy to give to a boy to learn on. While it is fairly accurate (relatively speaking), I have serious reservations about the loading system. I was young once, and I remember how stupid I could get without the risk of an inherent design flaw in the loading system of a rifle. I would recommend this rifle only for adults with stable mental faculties.\r\n\r\n[U]What I liked:[/U]\r\nPrice. I don''t think you will find anything in this class at this price.\r\nCraftsmanship. The rifle is well built, solid, with no rattles when shaken.\r\nAccuracy. 2 inch groups at 30 meters is not wonderful, but it is not bad at all.\r\n\r\n[U]What I did not like[/U]\r\nFinish. Very orange. Not a big deal, and easily fixed with sandpaper, tung oil, elbow grease, and time.\r\nLoading system. The loading is cumbersome. For somebody who intends to kill vermin, it is not a rifle that is easy to reload quickly (safely) if a second shot is needed in the case of a wounding shot.\r\n\r\n[U][B]Overall:[/B][/U] I think I did all right with this buy. The real test will come when I have some time to kill the pests that are damaging my house.', ''),

Its accurate its reliable[/B] and its used by law enforcement agencies more then any other gun. Even our favourite CZ is now making polymer version of thier sucessfull models, like SP01 storm and now Sp01 phantom. They made P07 Duty keeping in mind law enforcement use, [B]if polymer guns r so crapy then why they did that[/B]?[/QUOTE]\n\n[B]@TriggerHappy.[/B]............Let me elaborate a bit on above highlighted, as far as my own preferences and the backgrounds for these are concerned.\n\n[I]1) Polymer guns are not[I] crappy [/I]as such. I never insinuated this.\n\n2) You cannot compare Glocks/Sigs kind of polymer quality to the other and general class of guns, like Taurus, Sarsilmaz, etc, they''re totally different things. In polymer, I''d always opt for a Glock/Sig/Steyr/Springfield XDM.\n\nThese are top notch items. Here what''s being discussed is Polymer by Sarsilmaz!! In fact, I even doubt the polymer quality of CZ''s to be at par with above makes.\n\n\n3) Precision machining of steel/alloy is quite another task than dealing with Polymer. It implies higher cost of manufacture, material. Hence, manufacturers have gone polymer.\n\n\n4) Steeled guns are heavier to carry, hence in the era of Concealed Carry, users have gone Polymer.\n\nEspecially LE departments, due to regular carry requirements, 365.\n\n\n5) Glock is reliable indeed, yet not necessarily as [I]accurate[/I] as you proclaim, this could only be demonstrated, if a steeled version of the same was available, and I''m sure which of these would be winning hands down.\n\n\nThe CZ Phantom is around in polymer, just take it to the range against the SP01 Shadow, and let''s judge the charts here, shooter, ammo, distance, all kept constant!\n\n\nFinally, I do not mean to [I]devalue[/I] polymer handguns as such, no, not at all, even your PO-7 has it''s charms, yet I''d always prefer the PO-1, which is literally the same thing as the P0-7, just in steel. Google it up, yet don''t confuse it up with the SP01, it''s the [B]P0-1[/B].[/I]\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Aesthetically, it''s a winner though, but with guns it''s less about the beauty, more about a reliable track record.\n\nI''d say, quit them both, take the PT 99 instead, to make up the best substitution for one of these.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Did not try with IC so cannot give an opinion.\n\nRegarding the patterning difference, I have not pattern tested the previous models so cannot compare but can only say that there is no difference between Mobil chokes and Optima Chokes. Optima barrels are made to take more abuse of heavy loads and they are in no way better than Mobil chokes as far as patterns are concerned. It is all a Taboo that Optima Barrels and chokes give better patterns and increase the shot range.

So coming back to hunting ... u r absolutely right in saying DO YOUR OWN RACKIE and depend on guides only if they are 100% loyal to you and not liers. But how can one do rackie time and again by travelling 3-4 hrs from Lhr  ... once or twice a season one can do that but for regular hunting one has to rely on local reporting by having sincere locals who are with you for years. One more impt thing that I have always been confused about ... WEATHER. How can you predict duck movements will surely peak in 7th moon or 10th moon or later around exact 14th full moon. What can say similarly about rain factor? This has always been confusing in past as I have not found it to be a hard and fast rule in predicting waterfowl migrations at specific points.

But all jeeps are fit for all (most suitable are without any alteration). \n\nBrother; if you are visiting whole season for all good and bad at same area; than its fine with your one true guide. But by this way you should be limited. So, better you keep an eye on your surrounding for your better convenient approaches suitable for your travel distances from your living destination.\n\nBecause; every season every place is changing especially duck shooting fields (even you are hunting there generation by generation) \nIf not possible for your own to manage scouts than better you facilitate by all means to your local reliable guide for your desired scouting.\n\nAs per my concern; always scouting ducks fields in mid of October and at the end of February every season; even to the 30 years old fields known by me. For wild boar hunting scouting fields in September and than immediate after harvesting of wheat & rice crops.\n\nAnd than I am enjoying the selected spots for whole season; for other games (big or small hahaha) I am sharing updates with my guides cum friends around the calender time by time. \nBelieve me I am getting more than 90% satisfied results; which are saving my time plus saving to my self from "Zalalat & Khawari", and enjoying multi-pal choices for multi-pal games around the season.\n\nYea; its true only moon dates are not effecting to the ducks movements and availability in the area; there are many another major factors too; like changes in feeding spots, weather at moon dates. \nRains are not effecting negatively on ducks movements but shooters access can be limited in rainy days; but if you have an arrangements for rainy shoots, than its good fun.\n\nDucks can feel very well developing change at hatching ground like many other birds; so the rain in our region can provide pleasant atmosphere for their transit but can''t be hurdle for there migration; at the return ducks main concern is to hurry for approaching to hatching grounds. \n\nDue to rain they can stay for short time just to save the flying wings from water drops; but common concept is ducks are enjoying more stay due to rains at return, its wrong imagination. \n\nAfter developments of eggs ovaries only few ducks can drop here due to some late flight due to special  but unknown reasons.; but males will take advance flights to homelands, to prepare the nests before arrival of hen mallard (Mallards specially).\nIf shooter know the feeding spots; and true informations about shooting areas than rain can be plus point.', ''),

Me being a conventional bloke like the feeling of steel. \r\n\r\nCurve ball at you..... what do you say about the recoil of polymer vs. steel ? You are right that glocks are used by law enforcement agencies i.e the police and not by the armed forces. Take the example of B6 and Kilinc. Useage by cops is far lesser than that of military personnel who whilst not at war fire thousands of rounds just for practice.\r\n\r\nFaisal bhai did a good job and answering the rest of your curve balls.

(340613, 'Kel-Tec PF-9 review [b]The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from  highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 will be available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips will be in black, grey, and olive drab. [/b]\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/IMGP4687ModM.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIt holds seven rounds in the magazine plus one in the chamber. Thanks to the polymer receiver and grip, the pistol is very lightweight. I was surprised to discover that it weighs 18.2 ounces fully loaded. The Guardian weighs 15.8 ounces, and a &#8220;big&#8221; Glock 27 weighs 27.4 ounces.\n\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/IMGP4677DetM.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe Kel-tec is built for one thing only, deep concealment carry. It doesn&#8217;t have fancy gel grips, it doesn&#8217;t have a sweet take-down lever, it doesn&#8217;t have a decocker, or an external safety. There is no drop-in laser dot contraption for the Kel-tec. The PF-9 has cheap-o fixed sights with a little dab of high-visibility paint on for good measure. The slide lock lever doesn&#8217;t release like a typical auto, so you have to &#8220;rack&#8221; the slide to chamber a round. The mag release button is plastic but functional. The magazine is metal, but isn&#8217;t going to win any awards for design or ergonomics.\n\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/cimg7411qx0.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/IMG_20101031_142713.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe PF-9 shoots like it looks. It&#8217;s all business. Lacking one of those &#8220;new-fangled&#8221; external safeties, the PF-9 has a really, really long trigger pull. I am sure it&#8217;s bad self-defense shooting form, but at the range I pre-loaded tension on the trigger before firing the gun. \nThe PF-9 is a lot more accurate than smaller guns, feels more comfortable in my front pocket, and packs a bigger punch than most mouse guns. It&#8217;s okay if the sights are fair, that the trigger pull is long, and that shooting two hundred rounds in one session makes my hand hurt the next day. This isn&#8217;t a target pistol, it&#8217;s a people-pistol, and if I fire all eight shots in &#8220;real life,&#8221; it will have been a very very bad day.\n\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/IMG_20101031_142713.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/cimg7613iy1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/cimg7611mz1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nCalibers: 	9mm Luger                      9 x 19 mm\nWeight unloaded: 	12.7 oz.                           360g\nLoaded magazine: 	5.5 oz.                             156g\nLength: 	5.85"                               149mm\nHeight: 	4.3"                                 109mm\nWidth: 	0.88"                                22mm\nBarrel Length: 	3.1"                                 79mm\nCapacity: 	                    7 + 1\nTrigger Pull: 	5 lbs                                22.2N\n\n\n\nDisassembly\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/BILD0227.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/BILD0226.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j397/assadahmad/BILD0224.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(338322, ' [B]357 Remington Maximum[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 357 Maximum was announced as a joint venture between Remington Arms Co. and Sturm, Ruger, Inc. The cartridge is basically 3/10 inch elongation of the 357 Magnum case. the first handgun to chamber the round was the Ruger Blackhawk 357 Maximum single-action revolver introduced in 1983. This was followed in 1984 by the Dan Wesson double-action, stainless steel revolver, the Seville single-action stainless steel revolver and the Thompson/Center Contender single shot pistol. During the same year Harrington & Richardson chambered their Model 258 single shot rifle for this round as did Savage in their Model 24V and Model 24VS Camper over/under rifle shotgun combination guns. Although Remington developed the commercial 357 Maximum, a similar wildcat cartridge was actually developed earlier by Elgin Gates.\r\nUnfortunately, the 357 Maximum revolvers all developed excessie gas-cutting just forward of the cylinder within 1000 rounds or so when fired with full factory loads. Ruger withdrew their Blackhawk 357 Maximum revolver from production pending additional research and possible engineering changes. Dan Wesson approached the problem by offering a second barrel with each gun sold and a discount on a third barrel if needed. Since Dan Wesson revolvers have easily interchangeable barrels, this was a viable solution. There did not appear to be any danger involved, but it was something manufacturers did not like. There is, of course, no such problem with the 357 Maximum. As this is written, the erosion problem with 357 Maximum reolvers hass not been solved, but ammunition is available and the cartridge has gained some success as a silhoutte round in single shot pistols and in Wesson revolvers.\r\nEfforts to develop ultrs high-velocity revolvers have not been crowned with unbridled success. The 22 Remington Jet and the Model 53 Smith & Wesson revolverr is another example of a combination that was discontinued because of mechanical troubles. In the case of the 357 Maximum, the cartridge differs from the standard 357 Magnum only in case length, so one can drop back to shooting the 357 Magnum in any Maximum revolver or simply handload to lower velocity levels using the Maximum case. Factory ballistics were taken in a 10 1/2-inch revolver with the same length barrel is about 200 fps lower than the advertised figure.\r\nThe 357 Maximum was coneied primarily as an ultra-velocity, flat-trajectory silhoutte cartridge. That it would also make a good feild cartridge for hunting small and medium game is pretty obvious. Many would consider it a good deer cartridge, but when used in a handgun, it would probably wound a good percentage of the time. Of course, a good deal depends on the skill of the person using it and as noted, elsewhere, the older, less powerful 357 Magnum has killed its share of big game. Certainly, it will be used as a big game handgun cartridge, but the measure of success will depend as much on the man behind the gun as on the cartridge. It is difficult to perdict the eventual popularity of this round or even its long-term survival at this particular point in time.', ''),

It was deeloped by S&W and introduced with their Military & Police Model revoler in 1902. It was originally a military cartridge to replace the unsatisfactory 38 Long Colt then in use by the Army. Colt brought out their version in 1909, which differs from the original only in the shape of the bullet, a flat-point style, Colt, Smith & Wesson, and others make revolvers specifically for this cartridge. SeveralvBelgian, German and Spanish firms also make 38 Special revolvers. The S&W 52 Target Auto is still made for the mid-range wadcutter load. A number of goodvquality, lever-action Winchester clones (1866, 1873, 1892 ) are chambered for the 38 Special.\r\nThe 38 Special is considered one of the best-balanced all-round handgun cartridges ever designed. It is also one of the most accurate and is very widely used for match shooting. Any 357 Magnum revolver will also shoot the 38 Special. It has become just about the standard police cartridge in U.S., and to a large extent in Mexico and Canada. It is also usable in lightweight pocket revolers. Several companies make over/under, two shot, derringe-type pistols in this caliber that are compact and powerful for close-in self-defence. The 38 Special is also a very popular sporting cartridge for hunting small to medium game and varmint-type animals. With modern hunting bullets it is effective for this purpose. Because of its moderate recoil, the average person can learn to shoot well with it in a fairly short time, something not true of the 357 or 44 Magnums.', ''),

If an animal is hunted with a trap, or hit by a piece of wood or a stone, it does not become Pak, and it is haraam to eat its meat. And if an animal is hunted with a gun and its bullet is so fast that it pierces into the body of the animal and tears it up, the animal will be Pak and halal, but if the bullet is not fast enough and enters the body of the animal with pressure and kills, or burns its body with its heat, and the animal dies due to that heat, it is a matter of Ishkal to say that the animal is Pak or halal. \n\n\n (ii) The hunter should be a Muslim or at least a Muslim child who can distinguish between good and bad. If a non-Muslim, other than Ahle Kitab, or from those sects like, Nawasib - enemies of Ahlul Bait (A.S.) who are classified as Kafir, hunts an animal, the animal is not halal. As a matter of precaution, an animal hunted by Ahle Kitab is also not halal, even if he may have uttered the name of Allah\n\n. \n (iii) The hunter should aim the weapon for hunting the particular animal. Therefore, if a person takes an aim at some target, and kills an animal accidentally, that animal will not be Pak and it will be haraam to eat its meat. \n\n\n (iv) While using the weapon the hunter should recite the name of Allah, and it is sufficient if he utters the name of Allah before the target is hit. But if he does not recite Allah''s name intentionally, the animal does not become halal. There is, however, no harm if he fails to do so because of forgetfulness. \n\n\n [FONT=Century Gothic][COLOR=red][SIZE=5][B](v) The animal will be haraam if the hunter reaches it when it is already dead, or, even if it is alive, he has no time left to slaughter it. And if he has enough time to slaughter it and he does not slaughter it till it dies, it will be haraam. [/B][/SIZE][/COLOR][/FONT]\n\n\n 2611. * If two persons jointly hunt an animal and if one of them fulfils the requisites while the other does not, like, if one of them utters the name of Allah whereas the other does not do so intentionally, that animal is not halal. \n\n\n 2612. If an animal is shot with an arrow and, if it falls into water and a person knows that the animal has died because of being shot with an arrow, and falling into water, it will not be halal. In fact, if he is not sure that the animal has died only because of being shot with an arrow, it is not halal. \n 2613. If a person hunts an animal employing a usurped dog or a usurped weapon, the hunted animal is halal and becomes his property. However, besides the fact that he has committed a sin he should pay the hiring charges for the weapon or dog to its owner. \n\n\n 2614. * If a person using weapons like a sword, cuts off some limbs of animal while hunting, those cut off limbs will be haraam. But if that animal is slaughtered according to the conditions of rule no. 2610, the remaining part of its body will be halal. But if the weapon with the aforesaid conditions cuts the animal into two parts, with head and neck on one part, and the hunter reaches the animal when it is dead, both the parts will be halal. And the same rule applies if the animal is alive at that time, but there is not enough time to slaughter it. However, if there is time for slaughtering it, and it is possible that the animal may live for some time, the part which does not contain head and neck is halal if the animal is slaughtered according to the rules prescribed by Shariah, otherwise that part, too, will be haraam. \n\n\n 2615. If an animal is cut into two parts with a stick or a stone, or another implement with which hunting is not proper, the part which does not contain the head and the neck will be haraam. As for the part which contains the head and neck, if the animal is alive and it is possible that it may live for some time, and it is slaughtered in accordance with the rules prescribed by Shariah, that part is halal, otherwise that part too, will be haraam. \n\n\n 2616. If an animal is hunted or slaughtered and its young one, which is alive, is taken out of its body, that young one will be halal if it is slaughtered in accordance with Shariah, otherwise it will be haraam. \n\n\n 2617. * If an animal is hunted or slaughtered, and its dead young one is brought out of its body, it will be Pak and halal if it had not died before the mother was killed, or it should not have died because of delay in bringing it out from the mother''s womb, and provided it is fully developed, with hair or wool grown on its body.', ''),
(338336, ' [B]380 ACP[/B]\r\n\r\nDesigned by John Browning and introduced in Europe by FN of Belgium in 1912 as the 9mm Browning Short, and was added to the Colt Pocket Automatic line in 1908. It has been adopted as the official military pistol cartridge by several governments, including Czechoslovakia, Italy and Sweden and is much used by European police. Colt, High Standard, Remington and Savage have made pistols in this caliber in the U.S. In Europe, Browning, Beretta, Bayard, CZ, Frommer, Astra, Star, Llama, Walther and others made or make auto pistols in 380-caliber.\r\nThis is another cartridge which has been very popular because of the light, handy pistols that are chambered for it. The 380 Auto has more stopping power and is a far better cartridge for  almost any purpose than the 32 Auto. It is about the minimum auto pistol caliber considered adequate for police or military use. For self-defence it is not as powerful as the 9mm Luger, 38 auto or a few others, but this is offset to a certain extent by the reduced size and weight of the arms it is used in. For hunting or feild use, it will do a pretty good job on rabbits, birds or other small game. It has a fairly high velocity as compared to most light handguns, and this is an advantage for feild use. With cast or swaged half-jacketed bullets of hunting type it will perform well on small game, but not many shooters want to  bother reloading it.', ''),

If you shoot the deer with the rifle and mention the name of      Allaah, and hit the deer, and it dies from that shot, then it is halaal and      it is permissible to eat it. If you catch up with it when it is still alive,      it is essential that you slaughter it properly. \n          Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was      asked: Are the birds that we shoot with rifles and they died halaal or not?      We find that some birds that we shoot have died before we can say the name      of Allaah over them. \n          He replied: \n          Yes, if you shoot a rifle when hunting birds or rabbits or      deer, and you say the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger, then it will      be halaal, even if you find it already dead, because the Prophet  (peace      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to      flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he      said: “If you release your (hunting) dog and mention the name of Allaah over      it, then eat.” But if it is still alive and able to move then you must      slaughter it properly and mention the name of Allaah over it when      slaughtering it. If you do not do that and it dies, then it becomes haraam      for you. But attention must be paid to mentioning the name of Allaah when      pulling the trigger, because if you do not mention the name of Allaah then      it is haraam to eat it, even if you forget, because the Prophet  (peace      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to      flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he      said: “Do not eat of that over which the name of Allaah has not been      mentioned.” End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb. \n          Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is      it sufficient for me to say Bismillaah wa Allaahu akbar when inserting      bullets into the rifle when hunting, or must I mention the name of Allaah      when pulling the trigger of the rifle? \n          He replied:\n          What you must do is mention the name of Allaah when shooting,      and it is not sufficient to mention the name of Allaah when putting the      bullets into the rifle, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of      Allaah be upon him) said: “When you shoot your arrow, then mention the name      of Allaah” (saheeh – agreed upon, from the hadeeth of ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may      Allaah be pleased with him); this version was narrated by Muslim).

(338384, 'Preview of Browning SA22 Browning SA22 Gemstone Wilderness Survival Rifle\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe Browning 22 Semi-Auto rifle, also known as the Semi Automatic 22 or SA-22, is a takedown rifle produced by FN Herstal based on a John Browning patent. The rifle is currently produced by Browning as the Semi-Auto 22. Production began in 1914 and continued through 1974 in Belgium and production continued in 1976 in Japan by Miroku. It was first exported by FN for the American market in 1956, but was manufactured in the US from 1919-1935 under license as the Remington Model 24. The SA-22 was the first production semiautomatic .22 rifle, and is regarded as a classic firearm. It has been offered in several "grades" of engraving and gold inlay, and is a widely collected gun, especially those manufactured in Belgium. The Semi-auto .22 is a made from blued steel and walnut, and ejects spent cases downward. This feature was intended by the designer to keep the user''s face "protected from gasses and flying particles while firing". The lack of a side-mounted ejection port also leaves a large "canvas" for engraving. Factory engraving was done by hand at FN Herstal, and is done by laser engraving with hand finishing at Miroku. It has occasionally been sold with a factory fitted hard case, or with scope mounting grooves on the receiver. Over half a million SA-22 rifles have been sold since 1914.\r\n[url]http://www.midwestgunworks.com/page/mgwi/ctgy/browning-autoloading-takedown-22-rifle-history[/url]\r\n\r\nSpecification\r\nCaliber    22 L.R. \r\nMagazine Capacity   11 L.R. \r\nBarrel Length   19 1/4"  \r\nNominal Overall Length   38"  \r\nNominal Length of Pull   13 3/4"  \r\nNominal Drop at Comb   13/16"  \r\nNominal Drop at Heel   2 5/8"  \r\nNominal Weight   5 lbs. 3 oz.  \r\nRate of Twist   1 turn in 16 " \r\nSite Radius   16 1/4 \r\nMetal Finish   Blued  \r\nWood Finish   Gloss Finish \r\nStock / Grip   Walnut  \r\n\r\nExperience with the Gun\r\nThe Browning Semi-Auto .22 is the highest quality and best general purpose rifle in the group. It is has been used for decades by knowledgeable small game hunters and plinkers who have no particular interest in a survival rifle. If you are seeking a fine .22 hunting rifle that can also double as a survival rifle, and you can afford the best, the Browning SA-22 is the way to go. [url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/survival_rifles.htm[/url]\r\n\r\nOne of the last masterpieces designed by John Moses Browning was a humble sporting rifle. The Browning 22 Auto ejects straight down. It chambers the next round as if by magic. For the unwary, hot brass down a long sleeve can cause the once famous Browning 22 dance. In a lot of ways, the Browning 22 Auto is an aficionado''s gun. [url]http://xavierthoughts.blogspot.com/2008/09/browning-22-auto.html[/url]\r\n\r\nI was on the hunt for rim-fire rifle that could serve the purpose of Survival Rifle since 2008. Such gun should be a .22 LR, light weight, semi-auto as well as breakdown rifle. In September 2010 a senior PG member informed about the availability of SA22 for Rs. 150K, it was beyond my budget for the gun but began to study about and finally fell in love with this masterpiece. Some days ago I saw two SA22 rifles in a Pawn Shop and inspected both. One was a copy made by Norinko while other Browning made in Japan. The difference was obvious both in metallurgy and finishing as well as price. I was quoted 25K for Norinko and 75 for Japan. I made few visits in following days to the shop and finally purchased the original Browning made in Japan piece yesterday. I was manufactured in 1987 as part of its serial no (PR146) indicates, bought in Canada and brought to Pakistan by its first owner, I was informed by the shop keeper. A dozen rounds were fired and then kept in shelf for years to dust. I came in card board box and wooden container for box. A manual booklet with buyers address, year and location is also found. \r\n\r\nThe quality can be inspected merely by visual inspection, finishing, wood work and balance. No tool is required at all to assembling & disassembling of the rifle and even the mechanism. Special barrel mounts specifically designed for the rifle are available online and it permits take-down of the rifle without altering zero and further assures fine accuracy, as the booklet suggests. \r\n\r\nIt does not fit my camel back small backpack as almost 2&#8221; of metal/wood protrudes out of bag of both barrel and stock, I wished it could. I could not wait for next day or Sunday for testing and put on journey to a makeshift firing range somewhere near Ring Road. I had plan in my mind to go near Ravi Bank behind Band Road but found a better location.  Printed targets on A4 paper at home, bought clip board from UET Service Area and affixed the targets on them. Set out on GT Road towards Wahga Border, took a left after Ring Road overhead and suddenly a Pothohar Plateau like piece of land cam in front. It is 50 to 70 feet deep a KM long area dig for sand etc and many tractor trolleys were still going in and coming out of the place. We parked the vehicle near a safe area with a &#8220;Bowly&#8221; like well whose walls were naked. Target was set at and firing distance of around 32 walking steps away. Loading the rifle was a real pleasure. Just turn serrated mag tab located on butt plate ¼ turn and pull mag rod straight back until it stopped. Then dropped 11 cartridges one by one into the opening in side of stock. Pushed mag rod completely into stock and locked. The rifles aimed naturally and very precise. Firstly we put several rounds in rapid fire on one target, fired almost 66 bullets without any malfunction, ftf, fte. Firing was very smooth and robust. It ejected spent cartridges 4-5 feet downward in front where I was standing. Fired as fast as I could pushing the trigger one after one and there was no delay on part of the rifle.  (we used a box of federal and Remington hollow points).\r\n\r\nFinally we set another target on 25 steps distance and I fired 5 bullets to check the precision. The group was about 1.1&#8221; around the 9 circle. It was my feeling that from bench rest and daylight with good targets (mine were printed with ink cartridges almost empty and circles were not obvious from around 10 meters even) the rifle is capable of shooting 50s and 100s of cartridges in the bulls eye. We returned from the location before sunset. A feeler after taking the rifle in hands is that it&#8217;s a lifelong partnership started between us.\r\n\r\nI put my feelings in words, am no good reviewer and writer so please oversee my ignorance.

In addition to the right of self-defence at [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law"]common law[/URL], section 3 of the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Act_1967"]Criminal Law Act 1967[/URL] states that A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in  the prevention of crime or in arresting offenders or suspects.[/quote]\nFacing the attacker and giving him a "oppertunity to retreat" will exempt you from duty of care for presevation of his life but if he continues with his course of action.I f however he presses on with the attack you are justified in using enough force to stop him.\n\nFor example a golf club was at hand and you hit  him to bring him down then you have acted in self defense but if you continue to cklub him afeter he falls down then you are breaking the law and actually committing murder with intend.\n\nThe time factor is important. If there is an opportunity to retreat or  to obtain protection from the police, the defendant should do so,  thereby demonstrating an intention to avoid being involved in the use of  violence. However, the defendant is not obliged to leave a particular  location even if forewarned of the arrival of an assailant (see [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_retreat"]duty to retreat[/URL]).  Furthermore, a defendant does not lose the right to claim self-defense  merely because they instigated the confrontation that created the  alleged need for self defense. A person who kills in the course of a  quarrel they started might still act in self-defense if the ''victim''  retaliates or counterattacks.', ''),

If you shoot the deer with the rifle and mention the name of      Allaah, and hit the deer, and it dies from that shot, then it is halaal and      it is permissible to eat it. If you catch up with it when it is still alive,      it is essential that you slaughter it properly. \r\n          Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was      asked: Are the birds that we shoot with rifles and they died halaal or not?      We find that some birds that we shoot have died before we can say the name      of Allaah over them. \r\n          He replied: \r\n          Yes, if you shoot a rifle when hunting birds or rabbits or      deer, and you say the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger, then it will      be halaal, even if you find it already dead, because the Prophet  (peace      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to      flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he      said: “If you release your (hunting) dog and mention the name of Allaah over      it, then eat.” But if it is still alive and able to move then you must      slaughter it properly and mention the name of Allaah over it when      slaughtering it. If you do not do that and it dies, then it becomes haraam      for you. But attention must be paid to mentioning the name of Allaah when      pulling the trigger, because if you do not mention the name of Allaah then      it is haraam to eat it, even if you forget, because the Prophet  (peace      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to      flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he      said: “Do not eat of that over which the name of Allaah has not been      mentioned.” End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb. \r\n          Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is      it sufficient for me to say Bismillaah wa Allaahu akbar when inserting      bullets into the rifle when hunting, or must I mention the name of Allaah      when pulling the trigger of the rifle? \r\n          He replied:\r\n          What you must do is mention the name of Allaah when shooting,      and it is not sufficient to mention the name of Allaah when putting the      bullets into the rifle, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of      Allaah be upon him) said: “When you shoot your arrow, then mention the name      of Allaah” (saheeh – agreed upon, from the hadeeth of ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may      Allaah be pleased with him); this version was narrated by Muslim).

(338465, 'Review: Baikal MP-153 vs Hatsan Escort [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequently asked questions we encounter by esteemed members looking for a budget autoloader shotgun is "Baikal MP-153 vs Hatsan Escort: which one would you recommend out of the two and why?"\r\n\r\nIn a bid to answer that question, a few of the senior members at Pakguns setout to Sialkot (cherry popping headquarters) to see for themselves the true difference between the two shotguns that puzzle so many in their quest for a quality budget shotgun. Along with my take on the subject, I would also request the senior members to give their reviews.\r\n\r\nLocation: Sialkot Skeet Club\r\nParticipants: Denovo87 Sb., Owais Sb. Stigma Sb., Topak Sb. and 12GAUGE\r\nContestants: Baikal MP-153 (Courtesy of Topak Sb.) and Hatsan Escort (Courtesy of Denovo87 Sb.)\r\n\r\n[B]Impression:[/B]\r\n\r\nHatsan Escort, a lighter and more agile contender, lacking quality polymer furniture, is well built from mechanical standpoint and offers smooth cycling however when it comes to sheer durability and robustness, it is no match for the venerated Baikal MP-153 but at the cost of less refinement, more weight, more bulk and less smoother operation.\r\n\r\n[B]Weight:[/B]\r\n\r\nHatsan Escort is light weight and more agile. In my humble opinion, it clearly wins when it comes to upland utility. \r\n\r\n[B]Balance:[/B]\r\n\r\nBoth are equally and adequately balanced for an autoloader shotgun, that is, nose heavy.\r\n\r\n[B]Finish:[/B]\r\n\r\nHatsan Escort wins hands down. From mechanical standpoint, it is by far a better refined autoloader shotgun that Baikal MP-153\r\n\r\n[B]Furniture:[/B]\r\n\r\nBaikal MP-153 wins hands down. The polymer furniture is not only better finished but also looks and feels great. And from the looks one can easily tell that its built to withstand some serious abuse in the field. On the other hand, Hatsan Escort&#8217;s polymer furniture feels like cheap plastic.\r\n\r\n[B]Barrels:[/B]\r\n\r\nBaikal MP-153&#8217;s barrels are finished in a nice deep blue which looks great where Hatsans Escort&#8217;s barrels are finished in extremely low glare black chrome which should offer superior protection against the elements but the downside is that it looks less like a hunting gun more like a Tactical HD/SD shotgun. I am more of a conventional guy therefore would always lean towards to nicely blued gun.\r\n\r\n[B]Bolt Assembly:[/B]\r\n\r\nBaikal MP-153 offers a massive stainless steel bolt assembly with huge dual extractors and thick action bars. Making it a clear winner over Hatsan Escort.\r\n\r\n[B]Cycling:[/B]\r\n\r\nHatsan Escort offers a very smooth cycling feel and compared to a Baikal it is miles ahead. Baikal MP-153 unfortunately feels like a clunker when the bolt is cycling.\r\n\r\n[B]Recoil:[/B]\r\n\r\nRecoil is a very tricky subject therefore I would refrain myself from going too much into it but Baikal MP-153 to me certainly felt like a less recoiling shotgun. Could be the weight of the gun at work here.\r\n\r\n[B]Trigger:[/B]\r\n\r\nEqual, couldn&#8217;t tell &#8216;em apart\r\n\r\n[B]Choke Tube Design:[/B]\r\n\r\nBaikal follows conventional &#8220;Tru-choke&#8221; design where Hatsan Escort features Beretta Optima style longer length chokes tubes. Which in my opinion is a better design and should offer better patterns (atleast in theory)\r\n\r\n[B]Patterns:[/B]\r\n\r\nHatsan might have a slight edge over Baikal but the difference wasn&#8217;t something to write home about.\r\n\r\n[B]Ejection:[/B]\r\n\r\nHatsan was throwing empty hulls clearly 10-15 feet. This indicates higher bolt speed and in theory (atleast) higher reliability and load sensitivity whereas empties thrown by Baikal were hitting somewhere in the vicinity of 8-13 feet. Not much difference for practical purposes.\r\n\r\n[B]Durability:[/B]\r\n\r\nEverything about a Baikal MP-153 speaks durability and robustness. No matter how you look, there is no running away from the reality that practically hits you right in the forehead that this gun is built to outlive its owner. Furthermore, the barrels are CIP proofed, do we need to say anything more?\r\n\r\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\r\n\r\nIf I want an upland autoloader gun that would perhaps see less use in high volume shooting, I would definitely go for a Hatsan Escort because it offers some refinements which certainly make the experience more pleasurable but if I want &#8220;a come hell or high water&#8221; shotgun, Baikal MP-153 is perhaps the only wise route to take.\r\n\r\n[B]Pictures:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-153%20vs%20Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00737.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-153%20vs%20Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00727.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-153%20vs%20Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00772.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-153%20vs%20Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00795.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-153%20vs%20Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00749.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-153%20vs%20Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00771.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-153%20vs%20Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00809.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-153%20vs%20Hatsan%20Escort/DSC00816.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nNow I request the senior members to add their respective reviews here.\r\n\r\n[B]Regards[/B]', ''),

For every shooter, there is a high volume shooting. I have yet to meet/see a shooter who has done shooting to its heart''s content.\n\nTo me, Hatson has slight edge on cosmetics department.

The Barrel Cylinder Gap in a revolver results in a lot of gas escape  and pressure venting resulting in lower velocities. A  4 inch .357 Desert Eagle pistol will give much higher velocities than even a  6 inch barrel revolver. Same with the .32 S&W Long or the .38 Special Pistols ( Not Commonly available) Like the Walther GSP Expert .32. The pistols will give much higher velocities than Revolvers with comparative or even longer barrel lengths. The Barrel Cylinder Gaps vary from different makes and  individual revolvers. The Gap has to be there otherwise a phenomenon known as Binding occurs and the worst kind of a Jammed revolver is the result.\nNow I want to submit a pistol has a considerably longer life than a revolver when it is used with high power loads regularly, when a bullet is fired in a revolver it jumps from the cylinder into the Forcing Cone of the Revolver barrel causing a lot of stress and actual flexing of the Revolver frame.\nLighter bullets for caliber do most damage in Revolvers. Like a  125 gr . 357 Bullet will cause more damage than a 158 gr bullet as less powder is used behind a heavier bullet and it impacts the barrels forcing cone at a much reduced velocity.\nThis is one of the reasons for using .38 Special ammo for general plinking and Target shooting and the full power .357 loads are used sparingly. The zero will vary; and if the cylinders are not cleaned thoroughly after using the shorter .38 Special loads  there will be lead and powder deposits which can cause problems when loading or extracting .357 cases. Heavy framed Magnum revolvers like the Anaconda, the Ruger Super Red Hawk and the new ultra heavy S&W Revolvers are great to use with cast lead rounds as the lead bullets are kinder to the revolvers.\nRevolvers can be extremely accurate if well made and the Diameters of the cylinder cones is .001 inch larger than the cone of the barrel and lead bullets of generally .001 or even .002 in over bore dia are used( small hand tools are available to measure and alter the diameters which can be bought ). Casting for Revolvers and hand loading and shooting Revolvers is great fun, it is challenging and one keeps struggling for more and more accuracy and power with in safe limits. \nRevolvers are far more delicate than a pistol and careless handling can cause serious problems. A revolver once dis assembled for repair in our part of the world is a lost revolver, if you only hear a single action  revolvers cylinder sing when you spin it, you will have another romance on your hands.', ''),

Also a Revolver ammo is far more reliable when hand loaded  as a slightest careless mistake  or oversight in reloading pistol ammo will result in stoppages ,where as a revolver is very forgiving.

In my openion Stoeger is much better for the purpose and also its size is smaller as compared to pt hence will be more comfortable to carry and also in some cases conceal, in addition it has safety options which is not in the CZ999 which also leads me to prioritize it over CZ999.\r\nWhat would be your advice based on the experience, my sole objective is SD and HD?[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nAround a month ago I came to this family undecided and confused, but thanks to my elder brothers AQ, AK 47, Doc and the rest, I learned a lot about handguns.

Secondly it requires minimal maintainence, thirdly it can eat any kind / type of ammo, fourthly it does very well in the reviews by experts here and in other forums.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the size, if you want a gun for HD then I do not believe that size should matter and for SD purposes I doubt it that you will be eating, sleeping and shitting with the Viking so it does not matter if you can easily conceal it or not. Personally I like a full sized barrel gun and the Viking turned me hot, however the Stougy was not impressive enough.\r\n\r\nQuoting an arms dealer in Karachi who was trying to sell me a B6 when I asked him about the Viking "Russian guns ki tau baat hi kuch aur hai, inn ka koi muqabla nahin" and he also stated that majority of the Viking purchasers are from the rugged areas of North.\r\n\r\nThe weapons you quoted hint that your budget is around 60 k and all the guns you mentioned are good.

Yes, if being heavier is the scale to measure the longevity of the polymer furniture than I can say confidently MP-153 will live a healthy life lot longer than Escort. \r\n\r\n[B]Barrels:[/B]\r\n \r\n \r\n  Yes, Escort barrel(s) has modern non-glaring matt finish where MP-153&#8217;s  is conventional deep blue. Like n dislike is totally personal preference .\r\n \r\n \r\n  [B]Bolt Assembly:[/B]\r\n   \r\n  Agree with 12g bro on that, MP-153 has a big hammer fitted as bolt that firer can easily feel the jolt of on his shoulder while firing it where as if you are firing an Escort you hardly hear or feel the bolt.\r\n  As far as MP-153 having dual extractor I cannot comment on it as I am not very much aware of it benefits over single, but  per my simple (desi) logic if a dual extractor bolt can cycle flawlessly after one extractor is broken then having a dual extractor is a big plus otherwise I don&#8217;t see any benefit of dual extractor bolt over single.\r\n \r\n \r\n  [B]Feeding:[/B]\r\n  \r\n  Honestly Escort is my 1st Semi shotgun and before trying MP-153 out I was of the opinion that all semi&#8217;s are fed on the same principal like semi auto pistols i.e fill the magazine and rack the slide to shift 1st round in chamber. But MP-153 has unique (at least to me)  system, that is,\r\n  (1) lock the bolt back \r\n  (2) throw a cartridge in extraction port \r\n  (3) unlock the bolt that will chamber 1st round making your gun RED. \r\n  (4) fill the magazine tube.\r\n   \r\n  MP-153 would not chamber first round direct from mag tube even you try doing it with your head on the ground ;)\r\n  That procedure felt very impractical (rather unsafe if you intend to use a shotgun for SD) & tedious. You always will have a chambered gun in case you need to carry a cartridge filled gun or you will have to keep one cartridge in pocket to [B]kick start [/B]your gun in emergency ;)\r\n  \r\n  On the other hand Escort is fed on the same principal a semi auto pistol is, you just fill the magazine and wait for the right moment to chamber it with one simple pull.\r\n  \r\nUPDATE: Kindly click [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?5539-Review-Baikal-MP-153-vs-Hatsan-Escort&p=177554&viewfull=1#post177554"][B]HERE[/B][/URL]. the feeding issue was resolved later.\r\n\r\n[B]Cycling:[/B] \r\n \r\n \r\n   \r\n  Totally agree with 12g bro, Escort is fast & far throwing machine, even on meager 24grn skeet loads.\r\n  \r\n[B]Recoil:[/B]\r\n\r\nI am totally illiterate/insensitive to this feeling.\r\n\r\n[B]Trigger:[/B]\r\n\r\n100% Agree to 12g bro&#8217;s readings, as I am again insensitive to this feeling as well.\r\n\r\n[B]Choke Tube Design:[/B]\r\n\r\nDon&#8217;t know much about the choke technicalities, for me a choke is a choke no matter it has thread on the head or at bottom ;)\r\n\r\n[B]Patterns:[/B]\r\n\r\nHad only skeet choke available for Escort while patterning the guns and pattern with Escort was noticeably more evenly spread than the MP-153&#8217;s (with IM choke if I remember correctly).\r\n\r\n[B]Ejection:[/B]\r\n\r\nAgree with 12g bro&#8217;s verdict.\r\n\r\n[B]Durability:[/B]\r\n\r\nMP-153 without any doubt is a proven durable, robust & DHEET shotgun but Escort on the other hand is a newer product & has to prove itself. Although it feels Escort will not be that durable or punishment friendly as the Biakal is and proved to be.\r\n\r\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\r\n\r\nEscort Magnum Combo gives you everything you need from a shotgun (including the second shorter slug barrel), the pleasure of shooting, no hiccups of any sort, and comfort of carrying it in the field for longer walks. \r\n  MP-153 on the other hand gives you a confidence of having a tool that will never let you down what ever sport/role you take it into ([SIZE=2][I]just remember to feed it 1st round manually [/I][/SIZE];) ) and will serve your next generations unless you don&#8217;t throw it in the way of a road roller ;)', ''),

(338637, ' [QUOTE=avais;162245]Pistol shooting is among the most difficult shootings. This is not surprising - pistols have no buttstock like rifles and they have a short distance between the front sight and the rear sight. Each of these factors makes pistol shooting prone to human error and frustration. With a few simple techniques pistol shooting results can be improved dramatically.\nFirst, a good grip is necessaray. This is the foundation of any good pistol shooter. The pistol should be gripped with the shooter''s STRONG hand, with the web of the hand as HIGH ON THE BACKSTRAP as possible. This brings the hand close to the bore, therby making recoil control easier. A good grip will also line up the bore with the rest of the shooter''s arm, or possibly slightly inward. With the correct grip, when the shooter is holding the gun with arms at sides in a relaxed position, the sights should LINE UP with the shooter''s elbow. This makes it much easier to properly place the shooter''s finger on the trigger.\nStrong hand grip should be FAIRLY TIGHT. A weak grip will not adequately control recoil, and can also make jerking the trigger easier. Good tight grip will prevent the hand from moving when the TRIGGER IS PULLED.\nThe next step is to employ the the right grip of weak hand. The shooter should place the pad of their hand CLOSEST TO THE THUMB on the exposed part of the pistol grip. Then the weak hand should be wrapped around the strong hand over the KNUCKLES. By pressing the side of the grip TOGEATHER with the strong hand, a great, sturdy grip is achieved. To MAKE SURE the hands are lined up properly, the shooter can point BOTH THUMBS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TARGET. Make sure not to place the weak hand on the but of the grip, on top of the magazine.\nNext step is to master in a PROPER TRIGGER PULL. The shooter should place the pad of his/her index finger on the trigger as opposed to placing the trigger in the knuckle of the index finger. Pad of the finger allows only the first two joints of the finger to pull the trigger, and PREVENTS THE REST OF THE HAND FROM MOVING, THEREBY MINIMIZING PISTOL MOVEMENT. Once the finger is on the pad of the trigger, it should be pulled back SLOWLY until the breaking of the sear SURPRISES the shooter. Consistant practice with this technique will allow any shooter to spped up their shooting oner time. It also allows shooters to appreciate the QUALITY OF GOOD TRIGGER-which ia a GREAT INVESTMENT.\nLastly, the shooter needs to use his/her sights to the maximum effectiveness to SEAL THE DEAL. To do this , place the front sight IN BETWEEN of the rear sights, AND FOCUS ON THE FRONT SIGHT ONLY. The front sight should be crystal clear, and everything else, including the target, should be SLIGHTLY FUZZY. The shooter should not aim the target generally, but pin point an EXACT SPOT, the size of the HEAD OF A PIN, on the target and aim for THAT SPOT. Than the shooter should find the EXACT MIDDLE OF THE FRONT SIGHT and line this up with the pinpoint target. This TRICK alone will revolutionized the shooting.\nThese tips are not only a good foundation for any pistol shooter, but are guaranted to get consistant accurate shooting. Now get out there and shoot.[/QUOTE]\n\nThis description is confusing and requires pictures. Personally my grip is different with pistols and revolvers, and with both types of grip the rounds go in the X-ring. I find that the most important is to have the grip on the butt so that the barrel is in alignment with the wrist, straight to the elbow, straight to the shoulder. At ranges up to 10 meter or so, this enables the shooter to shoot instinctively. The barrel is pointed as a person would point a finger, and the shot goes true.\n\nAs far as which part of the finger to use, I prefer using only the tip of my finger, but I know expert shots who prefer the pad of the second knuckle, especially the guys who shoot single action revolvers. Some of them hold the trigger down and just pull back the hammer and let it fall, firing all 6 rounds in half to three-quarters of a second, and they hit.\n\nWhen people day that handguns are harder to shoot than rifles, because there is no extended stock... well, I laugh at that. If you are right-handed, your right arm [I]becomes[/I] the stock, and vice versa with lefties. The advantage with rifles is that the rear and front sight are further apart, giving a greater sight-radius.\n\nRecoil is absorbed by the primary hand, and the off-hand is for stabilising your "platform". With a weaver-type stance, the primary hand pushes the weapon toward the target, while the off-hand pulls back slightly, thereby locking up the shoulders and providing a steady shooting platform. It is not the muscles that stabilise the weapon in either rifle or pistol shooting. The human skeleton is what does that. If a person was to use muscle, that is when trembling and tremors begin to hamper the shooter at the third or fourth shot. Look at the stances that Olympic rifle and pistol shooters use if you have doubts.\n\nWhen I shoot semi-auto pistols, my off-hand (I have no weak hand, being ambidextrous) cups the bottom of the pistol (over the mag well). An off-hand grip "with the web of the hand as HIGH ON THE BACKSTRAP as possible" will result in the off-hand being cut by the slide of the pistol as it cycles the next round. That grip works well with revolvers (and I use it) but it is not for semi-autos. \n\nI have to go the rifle-range next week. If time allows, I shall take a detour on the pistol-range and have a colleague take pictures as I demonstrate options in gripping.\n\nKeep it safe, and keep ''em in the X-ring!', ''),

I have seen autoloader shotguns where unless you pull the trigger a cartridge will not strip from the tube magazine and will not enter the cartridge elevator. In my humble opinion, the existence such shotguns clearly mean that its not an abnormality.\r\n\r\nnow lets talk a little on the safety issues here. a hunter is walking in the field, his dog points, he locks the bolt back, throws in the cartridge and presses the bolts release button. his gun is good to go, now the same hunter with different gun would have simply rocked the bolt back and forth and he would have been good to go may be two seconds early.\r\n\r\nnow lets expand this shall we? now lets assume that the hunter decides that the dog is pointing at something he do not want to pursue or may be its a bad call. so he simply rocks the bolts back and forth and the unfired cartridge is ejected, he simply picks it up and forgets about the rest, why? because the other rounds will not chamber unless you chamber the first round manually. whereas if the same hunter would have been using the other shotgun, he would have rocked the bolts several times, stripping and ejecting fresh cartridges one by one till the shotgun is empty.\r\n\r\nlets look at some technical observation: in my humble opinion, the shotguns that feature such system do not need magazine cut-off buttons, where shotguns that do not feature this, mostly offer magazine cutt-off buttons to stop stripping fresh cartridges from the magazine.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=AK47;177484]I am kind of amazed to see that this feature of the Baikal MP 153 has not been specifically highlighted, if at all, in previous reviews of the gun here on our forum, before it finally landed in your domain for the deeper [I]autopsy[/I].

But it''s nothing that''s not tolerable. Accuracy was great. The pistol was made for shooting at 7-10 yard range for defense. At this range all shots fired were center mass. Even when firing double taps it still performed very well. At 20-25 yards my groups opened a bit with only 1 flyer and that was right on the edge of the of the intended target. In the summer months it gets very hot where I live and I wear cargo shorts and t-shirts for my daily wear. It''s hard to conceal my Glocks or 1911 pistols in this kind of dress.

(338725, ' wah! interesting discussion going on here and If I may add my input here :P\nDenovo Sb, the thing that you are talking about in baikal is basically an auto magazine cutoff. Its there in many high end repeating shotguns and I also happen to notice it on the combat shotgun being used by the USMC. It is also available on your escort. Just that on an escort, the cutoff is manual and not auto. You can engage the magazine cutoff and then disengage it manually.\nBasically after loading a magazine, you need to release the magazine cutoff and the shell will come out on the shell carrier. Now when you rock the bolt, the gun will be chambered. \non an escort, this is done manually. \nThe benefit I have found of the magazine cutoff is that the chambering control is with the user. While hunting in dark cold (very cold) nights in a 4x4, I normally need to change, or clear the chamber of the shotgun very often. The magazine cutoff makes it a breeze. Just rock the bolt and the gun will not chamber the next round. This is also very helpful while clearing jams etc and allow you to be relatively safer while also retaining a better state of readiness (with a fed magazine of course).', ''),

In many countries air rifles are firearms, while in others they are not, so that affects their statistics. In South Africa, a flare signal pistol is counted as a firearm, so when they release their statistics, the number includes flare guns.

(338820, 'Maintenance: Cleaning an Autoloader Shotgun [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nOne of the many evils facing an autoloader shotgun is the carbon fouling that occurs due to the employment of propellant gases in cycling the action. This type of a scattergun uses the force of the gas, created by the accelerated burning of the propellant, not just to propel the wadding which pushes the shot down the barrel, but also to cycle the action, eject the empty shell and load another from the magazine. This though efficient, is far more complex than traditional break-open shotguns thus mandating a through cleaning and maintenance regime to keep everything working.\r\n\r\nTiming is everything in the smooth functioning of an autoloader. All autoloading shotguns depend on a precisely timed sequence of events. If one step is slow, it can upset the sequence. A dirty chamber, filthy action, crud in your trigger group or magazine or a weak spring can alter the timing just enough to turn your soft shooting automatic in to a [B]jamomatic[/B].\r\n\r\nHow often you should give your shotgun a through cleaning will depend on the shotgun, your loads and the environment in which you shoot. Keep track of the numbers of shells that you have put through the gun since the last cleaning and make note of when the gun first starts to cycle slowly. A pattern will emerge that will tell you how often the gun should be taken apart and cleaned. It could be as few as 100 rounds or as high as 1,000.\r\n\r\n[B]Normally, I advise four different type of cleaning routines depending upon usage:[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]1. Up to 100 rounds:[/B] Just run a solvent soaked patch down the bore a couple of times.\r\n\r\n[B]2. Up to 200 rounds:[/B] run a solvent soaked patch down the bore a couple of times, take the barrel off, no need for any further disassembly and wipe everything with a solvent soaked path.\r\n\r\n[B]3. Up to 500 rounds:[/B] run a solvent soaked patch down the bore a couple of times, take the barrel off, remove the chokes and clean them with a solvent, take the trigger assembly out, no need for any further disassembly and wipe/clean everything with a solvent soaked path.\r\n\r\n[B]4. Up to 1000 round:[/B] disassemble the gun down to bits and clean/scrub everything with a quality solvent. Preferably, fix the barrel in a jig and using a cleaning rod attached to a hand held drill, polish the bore. It can also be done manually (the old fashion way) but with lots and lots of elbow grease (the old fashion way).\r\n\r\n[B]Some Safety Instructions Before We Continue:[/B]\r\n\r\n&#8220;Be sure you always handle your firearm safely. Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction, treat the firearm as if it were loaded, and keep your finger off the trigger. Pull the bolt-grip back, and release it. Repeat until no shells are visible in the magazine tube or in the chamber. After visually inspecting that the firearm is empty, manually insert your finger in the chamber and cartridge elevator to feel if there is any cartridge in there. Be double-sure your firearm is unloaded. You do not want an unexpected boom while cleaning your firearm. Keep your ammunition separate from your shotgun while cleaning.\r\n\r\n[B]A Disclaimer (as always ;)):[/B] \r\n\r\n[I]The following content is for informational purposes only.

This is the true cost of the pleasure that you get after shooting an autoloader shotgun.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA closer looks reveals the burnt/scorching marks left by hot gases. no worries. nothing a quality solvent soaked scotch brite/steel wool cannot handle.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nScrub all your worries away. over time I have developed a special liking for steel wool as it not only removes gunk/carbon fouling/burnt marks but also polishes the metal to a mirror shine. however I cannot insist enough to use the softest steel wool available or if you want to play it safe, use a scotch brite pad. our objective is to clean and shine, not to remove the finish. many high end shotguns offer hard chrome plated internals for the very same reason. to withstand serious scrubbing and to aid in cleaning. with scotch brite pad due to its relative softness to a steel wool, you''ll require more effort (in other words, more elbow grease). one more thing, do not use steel wool on anything that has been colored, painted, blued, browned, blackened and parkerized. steel wool is for stainless steel and hard chrome plated parts only.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image6.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nEverything all clean and shiny. as far as the internals of the receiver is concerned, all it needs is a blast of solvent followed brushing with a tooth brush to losen all the grime/carbon/gunk then another blast to flush away all the nasties followed by wiping everything down with clean cotton cloth.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image7.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\npull the bolt back to make more space inside visible and also to make space for the brush to go in and do its thing. make sure to brush the bolt face and its surroundings. special attention need to be given to the cuts and crevices inside the receiver. they collect the most nasties during operation.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image11.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA good bast of your favorite solvent/clp along with brushing everything with tooth brush should clean the trigger assembly. This should also improve the overall trigger feel of the gun.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nnow moving on to the barrel. using any quality bore solvent (caution: bore solvents are strong chemicals, use in open well ventilated area only) applied on a cotton patch, run it through the barrel bore a couple of time. let it sit for a couple of minutes. in the meantime you can remove the choke and clean it with the same bore solvent. then go back to the barrel bore and using clean (dry) cotton patches (one by one) clean as much as you can. remove as much of the carbon and plastic fouling as you can. your objective here is to make sure that the final patch comes out clean. I normally suggest that you use multiple clean cotton patches one by one till the time the the final patch comes out reasonably clean.\r\n\r\nsince we are dealing with an autoloader shotgun that depends on hot gases bleeding through gas ports in the barrel, we must vigorously clean this area as well because this area usually accumulates the most of grime/carbon/gunk. one may use a scotch brite pad or steel wool just remember to scrub the inside of the gas cylinder and not the outside as it will remove the finish (bluing or whatever).\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image9.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nevery patch has two sides so you can use the same patch twice by simply inverting it and having another go at it. as you can see that the final patch still shows some carbon/gunk on it. but since its only a shotgun and i''m not going to use the barrel as a drinking straw I do not need to go any further.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image10.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nWith everything clean as it should, lubricate everything as per your lubrication preferences and put the humpty dumpty back together again.\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]\r\n\r\np.s.

Both shotguns are in the 45-50K range, offering both a security and hunting barrel, that you can change yourself, according to purpose of use.\n\nWe have reviews of both. Check these links:\n\n[B]Germanica Combo model[/B]:  [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?2982-Review-Germanica-Semi-Auto-Shotgun-(Pics-amp-videos[/url])\n\n[B]Hatsan Escort Magnum Combo packag[/B]e:  [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?4403-Review-HATSAN-ESCORT-MAGNUM-COMBO[/url]\n\nBoth are[I] in-depth[/I] tested, reliable models. I''d use them for personal defense as well. No issues in using reliable semi-auto''s for PD, just ensure top notch ammo selection, no cheap ammo.\n\nThe MP-A is relatively new, and though we do have reviews on it, if you check the forum, we''re still missing an in-depth report. Generally, due to the Hatsan track record, it should be ok, but I still prefer the other two, since the stock of the MP-A is fixed, whereas folding stocks for both Hatsan and Escort Magnum and Germanica are available from the market, for security-carry purposes.\n\nI am not in a position to comment on which type of the guns would be more troublesome with FTE''s/FTF''s, between the box magazined and tube  magazined. I just do not like box magazines, coz it certainly would take longer time to load them than with the tubed ones, coz you''ll have to detach/attach the magazine each time, and also use both hands for loading the mags, vs one thumb only for loading the tube, and no\ndetachments/attachments.\n\nI trust you''re well loaded now for a better selection.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Its also has provision for chokes.The main difference in the american and russian  one is the position of the pistol grip. The american model comes with a butt that resembles theones foundoncommon shotguns .If u observe closely the the pistol grip is an integral part of the butt and the trigger and the trigger guard is placed where the ak47 pistol grip is.Now the yankies do convert their saiga into ak47 configuration that is called 922r conversion. The trigger is moved forward and the pistol grip is fixed where the trigger was located previously. where as all the russian model are a spitting image of the ak 47 with a side folding stock. The only fly in the ointment is the the russian models dont fire with the stock folded. However i saw the most top notch saiga 12k spetsnaz edition for sale at 135000. Differences are it a factory  top rail , a side folding stock , 2 8 shot mags and it has a magwell installed from the factory ) changing the magazine is just like the ar 15 no rock and lock as they say and it has the auto blot hold open as standard.\n\nregards', ''),

[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\n@Isiddique bhai, posted reply on Pakwheels as well. For quick reference, I''m pasting it here also.\r\n\r\nThe standard leaf springs on J40s are a good set that goes well with the weight of the vehicle. As the vehicle was originally designed for slow speeds off-road with load & troops'' hauling, and now we need faster, comfortable ride with lesser weight in it, certain adjustments are inevitable.\r\n\r\nWithout replacing/changing any major/expensive item of your vehicle, what I think is easily doable is to \r\n\r\na. remove the smallest/lower leaf from all sets. Thats the load carrier. You will be amazed how much flex u''ll get after removing that.\r\n\r\nb. As a general rule of thumb, they say it should be 45 degrees. My understanding of it is that:\r\nIf leaves are flatter....the shackle angle should be more than 45 deg. with reference to ground. And\r\nIf leaves are arched properly,....the shackle angle should be between 15-45 degrees with reference to ground and not the top leaf itself.\r\n\r\nc. With the existing set of tires & tarmac use, considering the weight of the vehicle, I suggest trying between 20 - 25 psi. There might be almost unnoticeable effect on acceleration in drag-like situation and fuel economy but the comfort will be worth that cost.\r\n\r\nd. Checklist of leafspring service\r\nEnsure all the bushes are replaced on every service or when damaged.\r\nEnsure all the pins are straight (not bent in the middle) without deep groves or cuts that would cut the bushes.\r\nThere should be no gap between springs when placed in position while servicing/tuning upside down untightened. (hope I''m able to convey what I mean LOL)\r\nLiberally use grease (not oil) between the leaves. That keeps dirt & water out for the maximum period and flex is maximized.\r\nThe pin collars should be in good shape so as not to squeeze the bushes tight.\r\n\r\nThat all for now that I can suggest.\r\n\r\nWassalam', ''),

A civilian or commercial model was also manufactured beginning in 1878. The Colt Bisley Target Model and their regular single action were available as well as several others. The German firm of Ludwig Loewe made copies of the S&W Russian Model revolver in the same caliber.Originally loaded with blackpowder, the 44 S&W Russian was one of the most accurate and popular cartridge of its day. It was the favorite of Buffalo Bull Cody and many other western characters. Good accuracy was reported clear out to 200 yards, and some of the first precision handgun shooting was accomplished with this cartridge. It was made obsolete by the 44 S&W Special, which was better suited to smokeless powder. Any gun chambered for the 44 Special or the 44 Magnum will also shoot the 44 Russian. It makes a fairly good feild cartridge, but it is not as the 44 Special because of the old blackpowder revolvers it was used in, and the fact that it can''t be handloaded to the same level. Cases can be made by trimming 44 Special brass back to a length of 0.97 inch.', ''),

(338908, ' [B]44 Smith & Wesson Special[/B]\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the bulkier smokeless powder the 44 Russsian cartridge was proved not quite large enough to permit efficient use of full charges of the new propellants. The 44 Special, about .2-inch longer, was designed to eliminate this problem, while using the same bullets as the older 44 Russian. The cartridge was introduced about 1907. Both Colt and S&W made revolvers of this caliber and a few Spanish and other European revolvers were also made to handle it. There has been a rebirth of interest in the 44 Special the past few years.\r\nThe 44 Special was for many years one of our most accurate and powerful big-bore revolver cartridges. However, it was never loaded to its full potential by the factory, and it was left to the individual handloader to develop truly effective hunting loads. Experiments by men like Elmer Keith to produce a big game potential in the revolver culminated in the 44 Magnum. The 44 Special is still popular for target or field use and can be handloaded to nearly equal the 44 Magnum. However, revolvers for the 44 Special aren''t strong enough to handle loads as heavy as those used in 44 Magnum.', ''),

(338913, ' [B]44 Smith & Wesson Magnum[/B]\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Smith & Wesson and Remington and introduced in 1955 for a new heavy-frame 44 Magnum revolver. Ruger, S&W and others make revolvers for this cartridge. Its development was inspired and much preliminary wark done by Elmerr Keith and that group of hand-cannon fanatics who insisted on the ultimate in handgun accuracy, range and power. Ruger introduced a semi-auto carbine in 44 Magnum caliber in 1961.\r\nIn addition to being the world''s most powerful commercial handgun cartridge, the 44 Magnum also has a reputation for superb accuracy. It is used more as a feild or hunting round than anything else, but a few police officers favour it because of its ability to penetrate an automobile body. It takes a seasoned handgunner to shoot it well as both recoil and muzzle blast are considerable. It is the only handgun commercial cartridge that can be considered really adequate for big game. It has been used to take deer, black bear, elk, moose and the big Alaskan brown bears. It has often been chambered in custom-made rifles, with the Model 1892 Winchester or the Remington Rolling Block action generally used. In a 20 or 24-inch rifle barrel, the standard factory load will develop about 1720 fps at the muzzle and 1580 fp of energy. This equals the energy of the 30-30 rifle cartridge. It is a very flexible cartridge when handloaded, and can be made to cover any situation within the scope of the modern revolver. Very few, if any, police departments use it because it is simply too much for the average police officer to handle. Its use in police work is largely a personal thing.', ''),

(338917, ' [B]45 Winchester Magnum[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 45 Magnum was first listed in the 1979 Winchester gun and ammunition catalog although reports of the impending release were circulating some 2 years earlier. the cartrigde is used in the on-again-off-again Wildey gas-operated semi-auto pistol and has also been adopted as a standard chambering for the Thompson/Center Contender single shot pistol. Although a number of gun writers were previleged to testfire the big Wildey 45 Magnum pistol during 1979, it still isn''t vailable even by 1989. The cartridge is essentially an elongated version of the 45 ACP. Both the gun and the cartridge were developed initially for silhouette competition , but with the ballistics deeloped (a230-grain bullet at a muzzle velocity of 1400 fps) the cartridge may become popular hunting round.\r\nThe 45 Winchester Magnum develops 72 percent higher velocity and 200 percent greater energy than the standard 45 ACP and is in the same class as the 44 Magnum revolver cartridge. The Wildey 45 Magnum along with the 44 Auto mag, the Desert Eagle and the LAR Grizzly are the only auto-pistols that truly are qualified as big game handguns. Although the potential is there for a fine combination silgouette and huntin pistol, it is difficult to perdict hoe well the Wildey pistol and the 45 Magnum cartridge would have been received by the shooting public. The price was high, and for strictly silhouette shooting, the much lower-priced Thompson/Center Contender in the same caliber might appeal to many potential buyers. The availability of commercial ammunition with hunting-type bullets would also be a factoe, although there is a good variety of such bullets available to the handloader.', '');

The 45 Automatic is the most powerful military handgun cartridge in use today. It is also one of the most difficult to master. The Colt Government auto pistol and the Colt and Smith & Wesson Army Model 1917 revolvers are the principal arms chambered for the 45 ACP in the United States. Several Submachine Guns have used it, and about 1943 a number of Reising semi-automatic rifles were marketed in this calibre. Imitations of the Colt auto pistols have been made in Argentina, China, Korea, Norway, Spain and the U.S. It was replaced as of 1985 as the official U.S. military handgun cartridge by the 9mm Parabellum.\r\nThe 45 ACP has been proven in combat all ove the world as having excellent stopping power. It has also developed into a first-class match cartridge with accuracy equal to the best. It requires a good deal of practice for the average person to develop any degree of skill with this cartridge, particularly when fired in the Colt Government Model Semi-Automatic. It is use far more for target shooting than hunting, its curved trajactory limiting its effective range.

Baikal MP-27-EM-1C "Sporting" and Baikal MP-27-EM-1C "Hunting".\r\n\r\nBoth guns are at heart the same, one is kept to a bare minimum in order to be light enough for hunting/field purposes whereas the other is accessorized in a bid to excel at skeet/sporting use.\r\n\r\n[B]Details:[/B]\r\n\r\nEach and every participant was given a [B]Ménage à trois[/B] moment with both Russian shot spitting beasts. Their respective reviews will be added here. before we begin, kindly do keep in mind that one is for sporting purposes so designed as such whereas other is for hunting purposes therefore a head to head comparison holds no true value. Two different animals for two different habitats, its as simple as that. therefore it is pointless to compare them on typical characteristics such as the barrel length and weight. However we will compare them on the basis of such elements which are common across both shotguns and are irrespective of activity they are employed in.\r\n\r\n[B]Participants:[/B]\r\n\r\n1.

Infact it was so less that in first glance the gun doesn''t seem to flip at all. only at close inspection one can see that it does flip. probably due to its ported barrels. second shot was an absolute pleasure.\r\n\r\n[B]Sights:[/B] I specially liked the sighting characteristics of the sporting model. it offers 10mm wide rib which was definitely more clearer in the peripheral vision. plus it has a big front bead (did not like the quality) compared to the tiny front bead of hunting. to me that too made a lot of difference. hunting model is supplied with a 7mm rib which is nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nGrip: I liked the grip of the sporting model. it offers palm swell along with a wide forend which aids in better gripping this gun. on the other hand, hunting model too has good grip adequately designed for hunting purposes. therefore I do not think there is a clear winner here.\r\n\r\nSwing: Sporting definitely has better swing probably due to its slightly muzzle heavy weight. whereas hunting model offered faster mounting probably due to its less weight and neutral balance. again no clear winner here.\r\n\r\n[B]Bang:[/B] hunting was far more quieter compared to sporting but we cannot declare one winner over the other because sporting model has ported barrels and we all know that porting amplifies the bang considerably.\r\n\r\n[B]Overall pleasure:[/B] I don''t know but I''m hooked. the sporting model is a real pleasure to shoot. if I would have kept my eyes closed, I would have never noticed that I''m actually shooting a budget shotgun. the pleasure is such phenomenal. on the other hand, the hunting shotgun feels very much like, you know! like a Baikal we all know.\r\n\r\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\r\n\r\nIf one has the option to buy just one budget over and under shotgun, by all means the wiser choice would be the Sporting model because with only slight difficulty it can be easily employed in hunting/field. on the other hand, in sports/skeet utility it would simply outclass the hunting model. besides that, it looks and feels very much [B]unlike a budget shotgun[/B]. this should be the reason enough to acquire this Russian scattergun.\r\n\r\n[B]Acknowledgement:[/B]\r\n\r\nI heartily thank and offer my gratitude to Denovo87 Sb. and Owais Sb. for inviting us to Sialkot for a whole day of skeet under the bight sun and for their playful and superbly enjoyable company and in the end hosting a wonderfully delicious dinner.

(338941, ' [B]45 Colt[/B]\r\n\r\nIntroduced in1873 by Colt as one of the cartridges for their "Peacemaker" single-action revolver, both the cartridge and the revolver were adopted by the U.S. Army in 1875. This served as official handgun caliber until 1892 (some 17 years), when it eas replaced by the 38 Long Colt. The 45 Colt is one of the cartridges that helped civilize nd settle the old West. It was originally a blackpowder number loaded with 40 grains of FFg powder and a 255-grain lead bullet. Muzzle velocity of the original load was about 810 fps. The Ruger and several other single-action revolvers currently chamber it.\r\nOne of the most famous American handgun cartridge and still a favourite with big-bore advocates, the 45 Colt has been around for about 90 years. It is extremely accuraet and has much knockdown and stopping power as any handgun cartridge except the 44 Magnum. It is popular feild caliber and can be handloaded to velocities in excess of 1000 fps. Old model blackpowder revolvers should not be used with any load developing more than 900 fps muzzle velocity. Although it has larger case than the 45 ACP or the 45 Auto-Rim, it is not quite efficient with smokeless powder. Using special revolvers, some very heavy loads have been worked up for the 45 Colt that put it in almost the same class as the 44 Magnum. Such loads should not be attempted except by an experienced person who fully understands what he is about and using those loads in a revolver that will stand the pressures generated by those heavy loads. This is another cartridge that has developed a rebirth of interest.', ''),

(338948, ' [B]45 Auto-Rim[/B]\r\n\r\nDuring WWI, both Colt and Smith & Wesson manufactured reolvers for the 45 ACP cartridge. This required the use of a half-moon clip to support and then eject the rimless 45 ACP. Thousands of these revolvers were sold to civilians after the war ended. In 1920, The Peters Cartridge Company introduced a rimmed version of the 45 ACP which eliminated the use of clips in the revolver. It was also loaded with a lead bullet to reduce excessive wear on the rifling inherent in the use of the jacketed 45 ACP.\r\nThe 45 Auto-Rim, while practically identical in performance to the 45 ACP, is proba bly a better field or hunting cartridge because it can be handloaded with semi-wadcutter, hollowpoint and other lead hunting bullets. Using such bullets at slightly increased velocity, it is every bit as good as the 45 Colt revolver cartridge for small through medium game. Many war surplus 455 Webley revolvers have been altered to shoot the 45 Auto_Rim, and many of these are used in the field. the cartridge is probably more widely used than at anytime since it was introduced as a result of all the military revolvers sold following the end of WWII.', ''),

Usually, pochard are of very bad smell meat and too bad in taste but its best of the best, its intresting really. Its bigger than other ducks in size and wait and too beautiful.\n \nThis poachard wonders everywhere and easiest to kill. 4,6, 8 any # can easily hit this bird. The intresting thing about this bird which i discovered is that they love to stay with COOT''s. They are like pochards (COMMON) in nature but they hate hidding in marshes and koondars like them, they stay in open waters usually.\n \nFlight is good and speady but they can be easily dodged by decoys & mojo''s. This is the most late arrival and stays just for a month or so. This year this was surprise for me to find him these days. \n \nReally a Very naive bird to kill, i always felt pity while shoting at them because they came to your hideout too slow and give u enough time to shoot. \n \nI was calling to a flock which just passed to our hideout, when i turned back this beautiful bird was inspecting our mojo about 5-7 feet high like a helicopter.................

(339285, ' I am glad a very important subject has been opened by Mr Starfish.\nBoots are not only important but can be a matter of life and death up in the high mountains or even the  hills where there may be shale, lose stones rocks and sheer cliffs.\nAs already pointed out by some one on the forum, there are different requirements for different terrain and temperatures. Pure leather is best with Vibram soles but it has a problem of getting heavy once it is wet and takes days to dry, man made materials like GoreTex are extremely popular and in the last twenty five years gaining more and more popularity. Boots which combine the two with oiled leather fair very well. \nWhat is most important is that the material the boot is made of should breath so that the moisture goes out and the feet are dry. Real leather and Gore tex  are capable and gore tex dries quickly. There is no use of expansive boots unless one is wearing socks of pure wool or a wool and polypropelene mix , polypropelene is also capable of breathing out moisture and keeping feet dry.\nOrdinary boots can keep one comfortable in temperatures not lower than 3 degrees or so , but when temperatures as low as (-) 10 or (-)15 degrees are to be encountered like in Baluchistan Ranges of Zarghun, Takato, or Koh e Suleman and Khalifat sar or Akhtar nekah in the months of November to March one cannot survive the climb and cold without these boots.\nAgain in the North when in the  KVO or Khyber range in upper hunza where temperatures drop to (-) 35 to 45 degrees highly technical boots and socks are required, these should be over size by one to two sizes so that the swelling of feet and two or three extra pairs of socks can be worn.\nThe boot must have a heel and should not be flat, the toe should be flat or well rounded with a short welt ( the rim that extends beyond the toe ) should be very hard so that when you get a toe hold it does not  bend causing the foot to slip and cause a fall.\nFor the lower mountains like the Salt Range and Kala Chitta a boot just above ankles is good enough, again it should be oiled leather or Gore tex preferably as one crosses streams and feet get wet often.\nExtra pairs of socks in ones day pack are a great comfort.\nWe need all these as our feet are not accustomed to walking in rough terrain, the locals can be seen running around in torn worthless plastic  shoes because they grew up on these mountains.\nBoots is a very technical subject I hope I have been able to do justice as an introduction to this subject.\nNever wear synthetic leather boots when out hunting. ( May be for one day shoot is ok )\nNever wear thin nylon socks, go for pure wool, pure cotton, or polyprop wool mix\nAlways break in your boot which you want to wear when going hunting, by wearing it all day for a number of days prior ,so that you know whether you are comfortable or not,\nNever dry your boots in front of a fire or a heater, use balled up news papers \nBy the way the best boots are the ones selling at an insane price in Karkhano Sitara Market Peshawer. The Tora Bora Boots are available for about Rs 3500/- actual price in US D about 500/-. There a numerous other models which are lighter and comfortable and can be bought at a fraction of there real price like Rs 2000/- to 2500/-\nThese boots are made by some of the worlds best boot making companies so do not miss this oppurtunity.\nBoots made by North Face, Danner, Bates , Wolverine, Meindel and a number of Swiss,Italian and German companies are worth their weight in gold when you are stranded high up in the mountains with the sun rapidly going down and wind and snow howling with the camp still a couple of hours hard climb or descent', ''),

Sure bro, but when we''re done with two mags, how about owning the [I]third[/I], also? Kidding bro.\n\nIn any case, what I mean to say is, that no matter at what stage you''ll have to reload, after any number of carried mags, reloading the boxed one is course more troublesome. I am sure, I could shove in 5-7 shell, within [I]approximately[/I] [I]the same time[/I] that I''d detach/re-attach, coz changing polymer magazines is not quite as [I]smooth [/I] a motion, as changing [I]steeled[/I] AK mags i.e. Polymer AK mags are even a bit more troublesome to make "click in" fast enough, especially during stress.\n\nMost, if not all, 12G box magazines are polymer.\n\nIn any case, it''s a matter of preferences, perhaps, and you''re absolutely right on the [I]critical[/I][I] seconds of time[/I].\n\n\n[B]@Doomsday[/B].........O.k, bro, thanks for clarification, yet with a bit of practice, feeding the tube can be done pretty fast, bro.\n\nMay I say, I doubt even a dozen of our shot-gunners here use the boxed type.\n\nFurthermore, Mitho bro has [B]a very valid point on the deformations[/B], and that may be one reason for more cycling issues with the box magazine types.\n\nThe shells are pressed against each other, [I]downwards[/I], just like pressing handgun rounds over each other. Yet, whilst the shells of handgun rounds are brassed/steeled, we have plastic here, which over a couple of times of emptying/re-filling of mags, especially during hot and humid months, may give some troubling deformations to the 12 gauge shells.\n\nIn tube-fed shotguns, the pressure of one round against the other is [I]horizontally[/I] acting, by the brassed rim contact of one shell with the [I]hardest plastic part of the other shell[/I], to the rear of it. Whereas, with the box magazines, the pressure of the upper placed shell is [I]vertically[/I] acting downwards [I]against the weaker part [/I]of the lower shell, especially during hard re-loading presses. This can cause deformations/dents/scratches, not only to the plastic part of the lower shell, but also to the very rim of it.  \n\nIf you check your brassed handgun shells carefully, after a couple of times of emptying/refilling of your magazines, you can see how "scratchy" the shells become, due to the friction and hard presses against each other.\n\nI personally discard such handgun rounds from SD use, and leave them for practice shooting only, when they''ve become too scratched up, and always keep fresh, sprawling rounds for the SD purpose. \n\nHere we''re talking about plastic shells, with an even greater likeliness of deformations.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(339323, ' In 1975, Ram Sar world convention was held. The mission was to protect wet lands and the wild life around the world. In 1982, Pakistan became member of world wild life protection organization. The organization is funded by private donation and Pakistan receives funds from abroad. Therefore, Pakistan upgraded its wild life department and restricted hunting.\r\n Gone are the days when I used to hunt near Kusar and around the border areas. Between Kusar and Chunia, there was a vast marsh land. Thousands of  gaggle and ducks wintered there every year. Because of over population and increased agriculture, the wet land is absolutely gone there.\r\nIn Chuckwal district only Talagang is open to hunt for a short period and only on Sunday, all other three Thesals are banned for hunting. Same is in Khuab area. \r\n	In Bhawalpur, the hunting land has been leased to our Arab friends and no Pakistani is allowed to hunt there except in few places. In Sindh, there is good hunting but on private land.\r\nCertainly there are few small places in Punjab that is open for hunting but very limited. So if you interested to see thousands of ducks then just travel to Klar Khar lake on the motor way but strictly no hunting. Now a days I live in the rest house on the top of the mountain in Kalar Khar and each morning I enjoy watching thousands of ducks with my binocular but with disappointment. The area is a tourist resort and very beautiful. Next year, I know where to hunt.', ''),

So that means if you carry 2 magazines, once u''ve used up the 6 shells of the first magazine, all u have to do is pull it out, feed the full one, and ur ready to go. On the other hand if you''re using the traditional tube shot gun, after u''ve fired all 7, u''ll have to feed each shot gun shell individually in the tube. That''ll take much more time.[/QUOTE]\n+1 with AK47 brother, fro home def there is no such need of firing whole meg , as for home def purpose , the guns are fired one in blue moon , or when its needed . yes it can help when u are carrying , but still i''ll prefer without meg 12g . once u have got practice with loading the shells, then it dont take much time to reload again', ''),

(339401, 'Atlas of Ammo Assalam o Alaikum,\r\nI find this very interesting its like ammo decoder, Headstamps often contain multiple pieces of information. The maker is almost always identified. Military ammunition usually includes date information, and civilian ammunition often has caliber information.\r\nSometimes dates are fairly obvious (44 = 1944; 72 = 1972; 6 12 = June 1912, etc.). Sometimes the caliber information is either spelled out or abbreviated (30-06; 38 SPL, etc.) and other times, such as on German made DWM ammunition, a catalog number code is used for the caliber. Sometimes information on the headstamp indicates the type of load (VII Z on .303 British indicates Mark VII ball ammunition loaded with nitrocellulosepowder.) \r\nSometimes markings are deliberately deceiving, as with some .30 carbine ammunition ammunition marked LC 52, made by the Chinese, or .30-06 marked B N 4 40 made in the U.S., both probably intended to arm allies while hiding their source of supplies. Sometimes the headstamp only indicates the maker of the cartridge case, or distributor of the loaded cartridge, or the using activity, not the actual "manufacturer" of a loaded cartridge.\r\nUploader was not working so download from rapidshare.\r\n\r\n[url]http://rapidshare.com/files/451661359/International_Ammunition_Association.pdf[/url]', ''),

(339508, 'Hunting Rifle Cartridges of the World 17 Remington\r\n\r\nThe 17 Remington was introduced in 1971 as a new caliber for Remington''s 700 series bolt-action rifles. A short time later, Harrinton & Richardson adopted the caliber for their Model 317 bolt-action rifle. It is the smallest caliber high-powered centerfire rifle cartridge offered on a commercial basis to date. The case is based on the 223 Remington necked-down to 17 caliber, but with the shoulder moved back .087-inch to lengthen the neck, while retaining the same shoulder angle. The 17 Remington is very similar to, but not identical with, the 17-223 wildcat developed about 1965 or 1966 for Dave wolfe, publisher of RIFLE AND HANDLOADER magazines. Experiments with 17-caliber rifles actually go back to around 1944 when P.O. Ackley, the well known gunsmith and experimenter, developed the 17 Ackley Bee based on necking-down the improved 218 Bee case. There are number of other 17-caliber wildcat cartridges made by necking-down various 22-caliber centerfire cases such as 221 Remington Fireball, 222 Remington, etc. \r\nThe 17 Remington has had a steady, though unspectacular, sales record since its introduction. It has both advantages and disadvantages as a centerfire-rifle caliber. Perhaps its greatest drawback is that it is a special-purpose cartridge suited almost exclusively for vermint shooting. For the person who wants a rifle only for that purpose, this is, of course, not a disadvantage , but those requiring a rifle for both vermint and deer hunting would be better served with some other caliber. Actually, some of the 17-caliber wildcat cartridges when loaded with custom-made, heavy-jacketed bullets, have demonstrated good killing power on deer. However, with the 25-grain hollowpoint bullet loaded by Remington and similar bullets available to the handloading trade, as made by Hornady and others, the 17 Remington must be rated as strictly a long-range vermint cartridge. On the other hand, it has certain advantages for that purpose, such as minimal recoil, redused muzzle blast and report, and a very high initial velocity of over 4000 fps. For a vermint only rifle, the 17 Remington offers excellent performance at practical ranges combined with good reloading economy. It can, however, be rather tricky to reload and requires close attention to details to ensure maximum accuracy and safety when loading for top velocity.', ''),

(339516, ' [B]22 Hornet[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 22 Hornet, based on the blackpowder 22 WCF, was developed during the late 1920s and early ''30s. A group of experimenters at Springfield Armoury is credited with the introduction of the 22 Hornet, Col. Townsend Whelen, Captain G. L. Wotkyns, and many others being among the originators. Winchester produced the first commercial ammunition about 1930, and within a few years it had been standardized by all American manufacturers. The original rifles were based on Springfield military and Martini single shot actions. Winchester announced their Model 54 bolt action as available in 22 Hornet caliber during 1932, but apparently these rifles did not actually reach the market until early 1933. In the interim, savage Model 23-D bolt action rifles were available in 22 Hornet by August, 1932. At the present time, anschutz, Kimber, Krico, Brno and Ultra light Arms chamber bolt-action rifles fro the Hornet and Thompson/Center has their TCR and Contender in the caliber. In the Europe, the Hornet is known by the metric designation of 5.6x35Rmm.\r\nThe Hornet was the first small-bore, high-velocity cartridge marketed in the United States primarily for varmint and small game shooting. It has never been commercially available in anything but b[B]olt-action and single shot rifles. Largely for this reason, it quickly established a reputation for superb accuracy at all practical ranges. No other cartridge of this type has ever caught on so fast or achieved such wide popularity. It has retained a measure of popularity, but suffers from competition with the 222 Remington and some of the 22 wildcats. It remains a fine choice for the man who desires economical shooting at ranges between 150 and 200 yards. It is a good cartridge for use in settled areas because of the light report and low incidence of ricochet. The 22 hornet cartridge is currently enjoying renewed interest and popularity on a limited scale.', ''),

Visit Brownells for 1911 accessories, you will find that if you gather all the specialist parts and add them up and then compare it with a complete company version - you will find that your costs are still below what say Kimber charges and your firearm is set up with the best items.', ''),

After more than 121 years production of spring powered air rifles, in 2011 our new pre-charged air rifle P1000 is The Novelty from DIANA.\r\n\r\nThe most eye-catching attribute is the two-piece stock, which gives our P1000 the appearance of a real hunting rifle. With its 300 bar steel cylinder with up to 40 Joule power, with 14 shot magazine as well as with single shot adapter, the P1000 offers best conditions for hunting purposes or field target shooting. An air reservoir avoids a decrease in pressure and allows maximum shots with the same power.\r\n\r\nAs standard our P1000 comes with a thread on the muzzle, to be able to mount a silencer. According to the different legal regulations, the silencer can also be factory mounted in that way, that it will be fixed on the barrel and impossible to remove.\r\n\r\nExperience a relaxed, while recoilless shooting, excellent precision as well as the high capacity of shots with our new DIANA P1000.', ''),

(339714, 'Shotgun Myths and Fables: interesting and informative! The word “empirical” is often used when describing data, data that is produced from testing and observation. It is an important distinction from claims, theories and assertions. The basic notion is that empirical data is reproducible given the same test conditions. A claim, marketing brag, or assertion needs no such basis. Theories that are well-supported by data and have not failed any competent tests are dubbed scientific laws.\r\n\r\nOver the years, scientific laws have been modified when more accurate data becomes available. Discussions of this nature may sound dry and boring compared to the less accurate or more bombastic claims. It sounds a lot more exciting when things smoke clays or kill ducks dead. That''s just human nature. "Crushing clays" is supposed to be better than just smashing them and killing ducks dead is apparently supposed to be better than cleanly bagging them.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no other way to actually kill a duck other than dead, we respond to cartoon descriptions better than things that can be shown. Things that are proven and factual are often dismissed due to their boring accuracy. The sizzle is often more interesting than the bacon itself. The only sizzle present in this article is that the facts sometimes collide with what we have been told to believe for so long that we have accepted it without question.\r\n\r\nI. NO GAUGE IS INVARIABLY BETTER THAN ANOTHER\r\n\r\nThe inaccurate notion of gauge, how many spherical lead balls of a certain diameter it takes to equal one pound, has always been only a suggestion of bore diameter. A larger bore diameter means a bigger hole in your barrel, but scant more than that. A slightly larger hole in the barrel, whether it is referred to as overbored, backbored, or something else does not affect pattern quality. Quite the opposite, from many sources including the recent Dr. A. C. Jones book, it has been shown to have no effect. What an excessively large bore diameter has been shown to do is affect reliability with fiber wads, leaving you with a barrel of unburnt powder.\r\n\r\nWhen gauge comparisons are made, what can be shown is that yes, a higher density pattern can be usually thrown with a 12 gauge versus a 20 gauge. This is only interesting or valuable if you need a higher density pattern than you already have. The original Parker shotgun was a 14 gauge, a year later the 11 gauge Parker was introduced. The 14 gauge doesn''t get much love these days, nor does the 24 gauge. Don Zutz wrote of his Neumann SxS 24 gauge grouse gun, a fad that never happened in the U.S. In the early 1960s, Winchester toyed with a relaunch of the 14 gauge, making a few in the Model 59 platform, but there was little interest. Had they convinced people that it "carried like a 16, but hit like a 12 gauge" perhaps the interest would have been higher?\r\n\r\nThe potency of gauge is primarily payload related. For example, one readily available but extremely good lead turkey shell is the buffered Federal PFC159F shell. It is a 3 inch unfolded length 12 gauge shell with a 2 ounce payload. No 20 or 16 gauge shell can complete with the payload in this shell, you can''t put more pellets on your target than comes out of the muzzle, so naturally payload wins the day. A good 20 gauge 1 oz. load and a good 1 oz. 12 gauge load are far more closely matched, as you might imagine, hardly enough to change your day on the dove field. Payload well overshadows all other considerations. The best available version of the truth is that with similar payloads, a 28 gauge, 20 gauge, and 16 gauge are all closely matched with each other. A 12 gauge sometimes provides tighter patterns at the high-constriction end of the spectrum. Phrased differently, unless you hunt and shoot with the goal of “extra full” or “extra-extra full” pattern percentages in mind, it isn''t enough to matter. If a 60% percent pattern percentage is what you seek at 40 yards, gauge does not matter.\r\n\r\nII. PERFECTLY SPHERICAL PELLETS ARE BEST\r\n\r\nRedundantly proved, the best profile for a pellet in a shotgun is perfectly spherical. The more you get away from sphericity, the more patterns tend to degrade at range. This is true for lead or for steel, with no exceptions than can be shown. It is also just as true for other shot materials. The problem with steel is its very poor density, so the far better density of Nice Shot and Kent Tungsten-Matrix neatly dwarfs the slight lack of sphericity.\r\n\r\nIII. PREMIUM INTERCHANGABLE CHOKE TUBES CAN PATTERN AS TIGHT AS PERMINENT CHOKES\r\n\r\nIt is well-proven that screw-chokes can throw patterns just as dense as solid choke tubes. A. C. Jones documented this yet again. Turkey hunters have known this for many years. Kim Rhode, Olympic gold medalist and eternal international medalist uses screw-chokes. There is no dispute, screw-chokes perform as good as fixed chokes. The tightest patterns that can be thrown from a commercial shotgun today are with screw-chokes. The reason is very simple: with screw-chokes, you can increase constriction with a specific gun and specific shell until increased constriction no longer has a beneficial effect. With fixed choke guns, it is difficult to sand metal back on.\r\n\r\nIV. FACTORY CHOKE TUBES ARE OFTEN POOR\r\n\r\nYet again, Dr. A. C. Jones expressed dismay and puzzlement over the sad state of factory screw-chokes. In his testing, Dr. Jones didn''t exactly “cheat,” as he did explain precisely what was used. He used Nigel Teague custom chokes. Three Teague Precison long extended choke tubes runs 264 pounds for a single barrel shotgun, 327 euro for an O/U. That''s $428 U.S. dollars for your autoloader or pump, about $537 dollars for three choke tubes for your stackbarrel. In the United States, some want to buy the entire gun for that, or less.\r\n\r\nNo drop-in aftermarket choke tube, no matter how carefully made, can correct for a factory installation issue. For that reason, Jones suggested acquiring a fixed choke factory gun, then sending it to Mr. Teague for both precision thread installation on the barrel, then chokes matched to the exact bore size of the individual shotgun. I''m not at all taking issue with Andrews Jones'' suggestion, nor with the well-known work of Mr. Teague. Quite the contrary, in fact. The best aftermarket choke makers have to compensate for factory tolerances, particularly the undercut where the choke mates with the barrel. To not do this would mean a lot more folks shooting out their choke tubes or permanently damaging the skirt area. A precise skirt to barrel fit means a cleaner choke, the sole attraction of fixed chokes, as no skirt or joint is present.\r\n\r\nFactory choke tubes are often poor, both poorly machined, made of unknown metal, and mismarked or mismatched as to constriction. They are also typically weak, as you can tell from the “Lead Shot Only” warning stenciled right on them. Americans refuse to pattern their shotguns and gun manufacturers are well aware of this. If you don''t pattern your shotgun, all kinds of things seem like they might work similarly, you''ll never know. The highest quality for the absolute cheapest price doesn''t happen very often, but when factory choke tubes are simply nameless “vendored items,” they are often acquired solely on the basis of low, off-shore, Asian acquisition price. The problems that Andrew Jones noted are to be expected.\r\n\r\nTHE DENSEST POSSIBLE PATTERN IS USUALLY NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE\r\n\r\nHow often have you heard that a pattern was “perfectly centered” on a game bird or a clay target? It doesn''t happen. If you look at a circle or a pattern, only one miniscule point is the center. Everything else is not the center. Pattern offset is unavoidable, the question of how much is not discernible by the naked eye. That there is pattern offset is well-known and well-documented. It varies in concert with range and in concert with the biggest variable of all: the human shooter and his skill and ability. It is for this reason that the densest possible pattern is not the most effective one. If pattern core density was all that mattered, it would be common to use turkey chokes on the skeet field.\r\n\r\nThe most useable pattern is not the absolute densest at all, it is maximum effective spread at the ranges we are shooting at that is what is sought. That''s why we have to pattern, for effective spread varies based on game, clay size and target presentation. The forgiving friend of a .010 in. constriction pattern hunting doves around waterholes may be a crippling, ineffectual disaster for pass shooting at 50 yards. Tuning the maximum effective spread for an application is a continual process, but the more we pattern and the more we practice the easier it becomes.\r\n\r\nBy Randy Wakeman\r\n\r\nCourtesy: [url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/shotgun_myths_fables.htm[/url]', ''),

(342769, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;181505]Bro, kindly allow me to give my humble opinion on the subject. a 2011 corolla''s engine is just another evolution of the 1970''s corolla (read: rust bucket). now does that it mean you go and trade in your new corolla with an old rust bucket?\n\nMy point is quiet simple. 1911 is one of hell of a design. not doubt about that. it was way ahead of its time. but dude its not 1911 anymore. this is 2011. one must understand and recognize the technological and engineering advancements that have been made over the years. when 1911 was designed, the engineering sciences were at their infacy. it is after the WW2 that engineering grew exponentially. infact there is a scientic law at work here. the more science progresses, it increases the speed of further progression. similary, as science progress, more and more discoveries are made at a much rapid speed.\n[/QUOTE]\n \nDear bro, your opinion is very welcome. Thankyou for it. It is as valid as mine. So by all means plz do! :)\n\nBy the same standards, let me dissect your argument for you. Your Corolla analogy is well placed. However, mechanical engineering often thrives on advancements in technology where the hand-made blueprint for the infrastructural design stays the same. The Corolla today is a built on the basic blueprint of the 70s design but is a different car for its technological aspects, for the ''mechanics'' involved in it are changed to an extend where the evolution cannot beg its comparison with the basic design anymore. Comparing that to a gun would yield non sequitur results. Guns are simple design without ''mechanical marvel''. The improvements on 1911 basics have been little, very few and quite insignificant to a point where you cannot call these ''evolutionary''. \n\nHowever, for the sake of argument thence, Corolla would be compared to a Porsche Cyanne or Carrera GT. Corolla is an outdated design, and even the latest corolla cannot be as reliable as a truly modern sports car, and I am not even gonna into the sports car revolution. Even if you buy a Corolla 2011 model, you will still not be utilizing the cutting-edge technology of today that makes a Porsche so much better.\n\nFor that matter, working within the same reference frame of semiotics, thence, a modern customized 1911 (eg a Kimber TLEII, my MOST fav gun on earth) would then become the 2011 equivalent of the latest Corolla model. Hence the argument would settle with a logical equation of:\n\n1970 Corolla = an M1911 made in the 70\n2011 Corolla = a modern day custom 1911 produced in 2011\n\nYou don''t trade your new car for an old one, neither a new gun for an old one. ;)\n\nNow to your second point. I think the comparison in the second argument of yours is misplaced. First, like I said before, you cannot compare guns to more sophisticated scientific advancements in technology. If it were so, then not only the 1911s but ALL handguns are outdated design. The latest discoveries in the field would beg evolution by means of utilizing the power inherent in a laser beam or in an atom. Carrying a handgun is an outdated SD measure if compared to the advancements in science. Guns are simple designs, without any mechanically engineered state-of-the-art technology utilization and have not changed much since the birth of their concept, let alone since the inception of a 1911.\n\n"but dude its not 1911 anymore. this is 2011. one must understand and recognize the technological and engineering advancements that have been made over the years. when 1911 was designed, the engineering sciences were at their infacy. it is after the WW2 that engineering grew exponentially. infact there is a scientic law at work here. the more science progresses, it increases the speed of further progression. similary, as science progress, more and more discoveries are made at a much rapid speed."\n\nSee, the crux of the argument above pivots on the time lapse module in cognitive paradigm, which renders the argument irrelevant being an argumentum verecundiam fallacy. I fail to see where it aids the argument at hand. \n\nIf the design''s being ''old'' and the ''advancements in science'' have anything to do with the ''effectiveness'' of a weapon, then that argument would render all handguns as ''irrelevant'' and ''outdated'' designs. The very concept of a handgun is outdated by these standards. But if we are comparing a weapon designed (mind you, NOT biult...) in 1911 to a weapon designed in 2011, I would humbly ask what I have asked before... what exactly has changed? Doesn''t your 2011 handgun has a trigger? Or does is operate by telekinetic energy? Does it not need to strike the primer with a hammer internal or external? Or does in 2011 handguns now strike primers through electromagnetic energy which is triggered by the human retina? We are not talking about medical/genetic sciences here we are talking about mechanical engineering, and e=mc2 is an old formula in physics but is it outdated? The physical laws are the same. The bullets are the same. The principals of a handgun are the same. Sure there are some tweaks introduced in modern guns that MAYBE make them more reliable right out of the box, but has there been a ''discovery'' or a ''radical mass-change'' that can be dubbed as a radical evolution or an earth breaking revolution? Adding a better extractor or a more polished barrel bushing or building the whole gun with plastic instead of steel can hardly be called "advancement in science". Hence, the inadequacy of the argument and irrelevance of the the analogy.  \n\nI rest my case dear brother. :)\n\nBTW, the quotes that you commented on are not mine. These were taken from the same website from which you posted your initial quote about the ''failing'' of a 1911. ;)\n\nWarmest Regards :)', ''),

(339846, ' [B]220 Swift[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 220 Swift was deeloped by Winchester and introduced in 1935 as a new caliber for their Model 54 bolt-action rifle. When the Model 70 Winchester bolt-action was first issued in 1936, the 220 Swift was one of the standard caliber offered, and continued to be until 1964 when it was discontinued. For a number of years the Belgian-made FN Mauser bolt-action was available for the 220 Swift, as was the Savage Model 112V. The Ruger Model 77, as well as Ruger single-shot, offer 220 Swift chamberings. The Model 70 Winchester is no longer made in this caliber although Winchester once again lists it in their ammunition catalog. However, Norma of Sweden lists the 220 Swift with a 50-grain bullet at 4111 fps, and they also sell unprimed cases for reloading. Hornady/frontier offers a 55-grain SP and a 60-grain HP loading. Ballastically, their loading duplicates the standard Winchester cartridge. It is a semi-rimmed case, as is the later 225 Winchester that replaced the 220 Swift in the winchester lineup.\r\nThe 220 Swift is one of the most accurate super-velocity 22 cartridges ever developed. Swift barrels have never been noted for long life, but this factor has been negated to a large degree by development of modern, erosion-resistant berrel steels since WWII. Factory ammunition has always featured the 48-grain and 50-grain bullets, but the Swift will handle the 55-grain or heavier bullets quite well, at slightly reduced velocity. The 220 Swift is considered adequate on all animals up to deer, and some authorities insist that with proper bullets it is a good deer and black bear cartridge. However, the 220 Swift tends to be erratic in its performance on large animals. The factory bullet is designed for quick expansion on light animals and this may be the cause of most of the difficulty, but the debate continues.', '');

CZ have a External Hammer, that when in cooked position'' then a  person knows it now dangerous, while Glock dose''nt have any Hammer and  the firing-pin of Glock is cooked internally with a pin after every bolt  and release with a trigger as in French made MAB-pistols. Glock I Know  is a Name of Standard and Quality but due to this NO HAMMER point I   drop to buy it. \n2)CZ have an External LOCK Leaver and the gun is cooked we can LOCK it  by pushing the LOCK LEAVER upwars and this is called Position-1, while  GLOCK dose''nt have any LOCK leaver and have a Trigger above the Trigger  so it means after having a bolt on GLOCK and loading the Chamber the  fire is dependent upon pushing the trigger only and the trigger is  activated by pushing the 1st and 2nd trigger together and in my opinion  its not a perfect SAFE-LOCK as compared to pistols having an External  Safe Lock Lever\n3) CZ have a design in which it looks like a GUN, I mean it have a GUN  -Looking design but the quality is missing in GLOCK-as it looks like a  TOY (Pardon from GLOCK-LOVERS but its a truth)\n4). A Gun is ever purchased from Personal safety or War, and it depends upon many things such as:\n- Price(which dose''nt matters)\n- Style\n- Beauty\n- Perfectness\n- Durability\n- Easy Cleaning & Operation\nAll these qualities were present in CZ but GLOCK have only the Last-THREE.\n\n5).I know GLOCK is NATO Standards and its the ONLY Polymer Frame Made  Pistol that''s frame is UN-Crackable below the Chamber after a long  duration of firing (S&W - TAURUS - Polymer Frame made  all pistols  have a crack frame history after a long periodic firing and no one can  replace the Crack-Frame- --- FROM WHERE THEY GET A NEW FRAME ?\nSo to make a good choice  I CHOOSE - I EXPERIENCED and Know through Personal experience that CZ ARE THE BEST (THATS ALL)\n6). CZ and GLOCK both have accessories available including Barrels,  Grips, Magazines, Firing pins and all what you want to replace.\n[COLOR=black][U]HOW A WEAPON MAKE ITS MARKET According to My View[/U]:[/COLOR]\nSuppose I visited a Guns dealer and he tell me that This is GLOCK 17, or  GLOCK 19 and they are NATO standards and also used by US-Army , and  many Armies and Police forces of Many Europian Countries and is also a  Cheap and durable 9mm and it cost only 65K and then I Make a purchase.\nMy friends take a look after my purchase and they also decide to buy  GLOCK, and after 6 months  that 1 or 2 of them have a purchase of GLOCK  at 85K. . . . . . IT MAKE A CHAIN\nI buy GLOCK------> You look and buy GLOCK------> WE 2 have GLOCK  then the 3rd think it MUST BE GOOD SO BUY GLOCK -----> the 3rd  buy------> 4th & 5th Look us and dont use their brains and make a  deal of GLOCK and so on........... this make the Weapon his Market and  its prices goes Up & Up & Up. (GLOCK was introduce by Hashtnagar  Arms Peshawar in NWFP and its price was 65K and now one was purchasing  it- but now a days Its un available in Peshawar and its price is 300K).\n[U]WHY I BUY the SAME GUN WHILE I HAVE ONE:[/U]\nGun is a machine and May be its Extremely-perfect and Accurate but don''t  ever believe it. . .  I fall in LOVE with CZ due to its perfectness in  all aspects and I decide to carry the Same Gun in same Caliber with my  first Experienced Gun. (Taking 2 guns of Same Caliber for safety at a  time means both use same bullets and if ONE got malfunction in the time  of NEED then you can use the Another ONE).\n[U]NOTE/ ITS A BET FROM MY SIDE:[/U]\nITS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS THE TARGET IN 50-METERS WITH CZ 75B.

(339849, ' [B]222 Remington[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 222 Remington was introduced by Remington in 1950 for their 722 bolt-action rifle which was superseded by the current 700 series. For a short time, the Remington Model 760 slide-action repeater was also available in this caliber. At the present time, practically every company that manufactures a high-powered bolt-action rifle, affers at least one version of the 222 Remington. In addition, the Valmet 412S, savage Model 24-V and 389 over/under combination guns chamber the 222, as does the Thompson/Contender and other single shots. The 222 Remington achieved great popularity in a very short time and appears to be sustaining its place, although the 223 Remington. because of the availability of military ammunition, has some in-roads in sales.\r\nThe 222 Remington is in about the same class as the older 219 Zipper, but is rimless and adapted to modern bolt-action rifles. It is not based on any older case necked-down, but is of original design. It is a more or less scaled-down version of the 30-06, and fills the gap between 218 Bee and 220 Swift. It is better suited to the needs of the average person who desires a high-velocity 22 than any other cartridge currently available. A great many benchrest matches have been won with the 222 Remington, and it has a reputation for superb accuracy. It is an excellent 200 to 250-yard cartridge for the full range of varmint and small game. However, quite a few deer, antelope and black bear have fallen to the 222, and with the heavier 55-grain bullets and a thick jacket, it will kill such game at short range in open country.', ''),

(339887, ' Salam All,\n@Aqleem - Firstly congratulations.  Secondly, as far as cleaning goes for this weapon its probably the most hardest thing - atleast it as been for me.  I recommend that you buy some Birchwood Casey Gun Scrubber for cleaning.  \nOtherwise the hard way is to disassemble it.  First you have to pull out the main spring housing lever out and then guide the entire mainspring unit out of the grip.  Once thats out then you have to pull out the bolt.  Then using either a rubber or plastic mallet in one hand and the gun in the other you have to hit the rear upper frame for it to slide out of the grip section.  Everything is very simple to put back.  I do NOT recommend further disassembly of the grip frame as its confusing to put back in.  The other most hardest thing to put back is the mainspring housing AND it must be aligned properly or the hammer strut will get stuck in between and you will really be stuck.  \nI STRONGLY recommend to clean it by simply opening and locking the bolt in the rearward position and using either WD40 or No.9 or Gunscrubber.... don''t try and disassemble.', ''),

Well, feelings aside you are comparing two different pistol designs...  On one hand you have a classic John Browning design tried and tested over the ages, being manufactured by literally every manufacturer and on the second hand you are comparing it to a well renowned ergonomically designed pistol thats much younger; however, converted to .45acp!

On the [I]reliability[/I] check with the more commonly available ammo.\n\nI agree Sir, but I''d suggest the [I]reliability[/I] part is checked during this test, [I]separately[/I], and not as part of the remaining test, which is more centered around the [I]out of the box[/I] use by a traditional buyer, yet with the rightly chosen ammo. Hence, from the aspect, that the buyer at least will be careful in selecting his SD ammo. I doubt the majority of SD users would use local reloads, especially with imported guns. And by the way, the MP 446 would stand out a clear winner in this regard, I suppose. \n\nAgreed, we can do the reliability test with troublesome loads, like POF 1Z/2Z on the spot as well, yet as a [I]separate feature[/I]. If agreed, we can incorporate the score of this feature in the overall aggregate of the test for each gun, yet, I''d humbly request it as a[I] separate measure[/I], [B]since we should assume that the buyer will be selective with ammo[/B] [B]for SD use[/B], and ensure he''s getting the right thing, only from the right dealers. We''ll leave this occasional and bad luck variable upon the customer himself.\n\n[I]The thing to discuss here is actually the [B]mode [/B]of conducting the test[/I]. I am open for suggestions. My personal suggestion is as follows:\n\n[B]Part 1[/B]:\n\nEach of the guns should be fired at a constant SD range, say 10 mtrs, 5 shots in each string, each string by 1 of 3 different class of shooters, skilled, intermediate, amateur, and then calculate the gross average score for each gun. The shooting should be IPSC style, hence pick from the table and blast out, or out of the holster and blast out, kind of quick firing, since majority of members have SD purposes behind the purchases, and we should try to resemble that kind of shooting. This means 15 shots with each gun, for this part of the test, hence some 75 to 90 rounds total requirement (5-6 handguns)\n\n[B]Part 2[/B]:\n\nThe second part should be pure [I]accuracy testing[/I], hence say from 15 meters distance, 5-7 shots by each gun, by only [B]1[/B] top skilled shooter, double handed, deliberate fires.\n\nThis would require [B]30[/B] rounds only in total, from 6 handguns,[B] if using 5 rounds in each string[/B] with each gun. If using 7, it means 42 rounds, still with 6 guns in mind. I somehow just feel that 7 shots would say more than 5, coz at times the 1.st shot usually lands at a strange point, bearing in mind that the shooters do not have all these guns in their normal use, and may be new to some of them.\n\nThe distance of 15 meters has been suggested as to give the guns a bit of run for the money. Furthermore, which ever gun would shoot good from this distance, would definitely shoot good from the shorter and more traditional SD ranges, say 7 meters.\n\nSince with this suggestion, a bit different from my initial in which I suggested 3 shooters to do the accuracy testing, we only have [B]one[/B] top skilled shooter here, hence the ammo requirement also has been reduced by 10 shots with each gun, thus a reduction of some 50-60 rounds, making total requirement come down to close to 150 rounds, for the main test. \n\n[COLOR="red"]The overall aggregate score of the two parts above should be the declarable result[/COLOR]. \n\nFinally, as a topping of the cake, we''ll make the winning [I]budget gun[/I] compete with a [I]high-end gun[/I], say the Glock 19, again using same mode as above, hence requiring 15 shots with each gun in part 1, and 5-7 rounds each in part 2, thus around 40 rounds for the dual between the budget and the high-end class. \n\nThis brings ammo requirement to some 190 rounds (150+40) for the conclusion of the day.\n\nAt day''s end we''ll get to know which budget gun is the best for the budget class customer, and how much below it really is in performance vs the high-ender, at least within this purpose of use, durability, versatility, tennifer coatings, etc, all extra goodies disregarded.\n\nI believe it will serve greatly for the choices here, especially for new and confused members.\n\n I am also ready to add 1 more skilled shooter to the accuracy testing, since it would give an even better overall picture.\n\nLet me please know of further suggestions.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

On the [I]reliability[/I] check with the more commonly available ammo.\r\n\r\nI agree Sir, but I''d suggest the [I]reliability[/I] part is checked during this test, [I]separately[/I], and not as part of the remaining test, which is more centered around the [I]out of the box[/I] use by a traditional buyer, yet with the rightly chosen ammo. Hence, from the aspect, that the buyer at least will be careful in selecting his SD ammo. I doubt the majority of SD users would use local reloads, especially with imported guns. And by the way, the MP 446 would stand out a clear winner in this regard, I suppose. \r\n\r\nAgreed, we can do the reliability test with troublesome loads, like POF 1Z/2Z on the spot as well, yet as a [I]separate feature[/I]. If agreed, we can incorporate the score of this feature in the overall aggregate of the test for each gun, yet, I''d humbly request it as a[I] separate measure[/I], [B]since we should assume that the buyer will be selective with ammo[/B] [B]for SD use[/B], and ensure he''s getting the right thing, only from the right dealers. We''ll leave this occasional and bad luck variable upon the customer himself.\r\n\r\n[I]The thing to discuss here is actually the [B]mode [/B]of conducting the test[/I]. I am open for suggestions. My personal suggestion is as follows:\r\n\r\n[B]Part 1[/B]:\r\n\r\nEach of the guns should be fired at a constant SD range, say 10 mtrs, 5 shots in each string, each string by 1 of 3 different class of shooters, skilled, intermediate, amateur, and then calculate the gross average score for each gun. The shooting should be IPSC style, hence pick from the table and blast out, or out of the holster and blast out, kind of quick firing, since majority of members have SD purposes behind the purchases, and we should try to resemble that kind of shooting. This means 15 shots with each gun, for this part of the test, hence some 75 to 90 rounds total requirement (5-6 handguns)\r\n\r\n[B]Part 2[/B]:\r\n\r\nThe second part should be pure [I]accuracy testing[/I], hence say from 15 meters distance, 5-7 shots by each gun, by only [B]1[/B] top skilled shooter, double handed, deliberate fires.\r\n\r\nThis would require [B]30[/B] rounds only in total, from 6 handguns,[B] if using 5 rounds in each string[/B] with each gun. If using 7, it means 42 rounds, still with 6 guns in mind. I somehow just feel that 7 shots would say more than 5, coz at times the 1.st shot usually lands at a strange point, bearing in mind that the shooters do not have all these guns in their normal use, and may be new to some of them.\r\n\r\nThe distance of 15 meters has been suggested as to give the guns a bit of run for the money. Furthermore, which ever gun would shoot good from this distance, would definitely shoot good from the shorter and more traditional SD ranges, say 7 meters.\r\n\r\nSince with this suggestion, a bit different from my initial in which I suggested 3 shooters to do the accuracy testing, we only have [B]one[/B] top skilled shooter here, hence the ammo requirement also has been reduced by 10 shots with each gun, thus a reduction of some 50-60 rounds, making total requirement come down to close to 150 rounds, for the main test. \r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"]The overall aggregate score of the two parts above should be the declarable result[/COLOR]. \r\n\r\nFinally, as a topping of the cake, we''ll make the winning [I]budget gun[/I] compete with a [I]high-end gun[/I], say the Glock 19, again using same mode as above, hence requiring 15 shots with each gun in part 1, and 5-7 rounds each in part 2, thus around 40 rounds for the dual between the budget and the high-end class. \r\n\r\nThis brings ammo requirement to some 190 rounds (150+40) for the conclusion of the day.\r\n\r\nAt day''s end we''ll get to know which budget gun is the best for the budget class customer, and how much below it really is in performance vs the high-ender, at least within this purpose of use, durability, versatility, tennifer coatings, etc, all extra goodies disregarded.\r\n\r\nI believe it will serve greatly for the choices here, especially for new and confused members.\r\n\r\n I am also ready to add 1 more skilled shooter to the accuracy testing, since it would give an even better overall picture.\r\n\r\nLet me please know of further suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nGosh, you''re one organized bloke...

(340005, 'Difference &amp; Similarities between Baikal Mp-443 Yarigin Grach &amp; Baikal MP-446 Viking At last I managed to spare some time to take and upload the photos of my newly purchased NIB Baikal MP-446 Viking  all steel version  pistol. This too, happened as there is an outage and the activities due to presence of electricity are at halt. I took the opportunity and started take photos on generator driven lights, thus, the poor light factor may be attributed to the above element.\n\nThe thought behind to specifically buy Baikal MP-446 Viking Pistol was to have a combat level weapon having a Military and battle proven / battle hardened background. Though Baikal MP-446 Viking is itself not adopted as a side arm of Russian Army but I have extensively gone through the relevant threads on Baikal MP-446 Viking and decided to buy it as it is termed as a combat pistol on the relevant website and atleast it is the closest copy of MP-443 Yarigin Grach, the official side arm of Russian Army.\n\nThere is a polymer version available also, comparatively at cheaper prices however I always think to pay some extra but to get a thing of higher caliber, hence, went for Baikal MP-446 Viking all steel version. While purchasing this black beauty I examined the polymer version also and there were some pistols in polymer version modeled 2009 and when compared the polymer version of 2009 and 2010 of Viking MP-446, I clearly felt that the polymer version of 2009 was some how substandard in quality of polymer and having a less weight, however, as Baikal MP-446 Viking all steel version was the only piece available with dealer at that time, thus, I could not compare the all steel version of 2010 that I bought and the models of previous years. \n\nNow coming to the issue of differences and similarities between Baikal Viking MP-446 and MP-443 Yarigin Grach. The biggest difference between both pistols is obviously that Baikal Mp-443 Yarigin Grach is the official side arm of Russian Army while Baikal Mp-446 Viking is its civilian (and as termed by the manual a sporting version. However, I quote one of my senior friend in previous threads that it is written on the manual to coup up with the export implications of various countries.) and the biggest similarity between both pistols is that they are made in same enterprise, and same country. To my observations that I have made not throughly rather than in haste I am of the opinion that the only visible difference between two pistols is the front sight which, in Yarigin Grach is a bit larger than the smaller one, possessed by MP-446 Viking. Otherwise, the both of pistols are same to the extent of pin by pin and notch by notch.( here i am tlking about steel version) The observation made above is based upon the pictures of Yarigin  Grach available on the net and the comparison of my Baikal MP-446 Viking all steel version. Below I try to compare both pistols from the pictures of Grach downloaded from the internet and pictures taken by me in a poor light condition. This comparison belongs to the appearance and get up of the pistols I have, yet to compare them in field stripped condition which postpone for few days with due apologies from my brothers. I did field strip my Baikal MP-446 Viking after firing a magazine of 18 rounds to clean it up but at that time I didn''t have camera and I do not prefer to use mobile phone camera owing to my nature.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1310[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1309[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1311[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1312[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1313[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1308[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1307[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1306[/ATTACH]', ''),

Ducks really showered to decoys and we got a bag of 50 within 90 minutes. At 7.15 we started packing up. 50 is a good bag and we were not there to eliminate this species from earth. We enjoyed the shoot and we both gunner were too fit today, hardly missed much rather got a good share from each flight. \nOn our way back we gifted 15 ducks to our host, who provided us a good shoot in shortest span of time.\nHope reports will come more better today because there was a peak return which was expected and awaited.\nWe reached back home before 11 am and i received my elder brother at right time. \nCheeeeeeeeeeeeers n have a nice day\n\nUnlucky for those who missed my invitation, anyhow, opportunities strikes again.', ''),

Talibwala is a good area for ducks but we were not at some river bed. We were in adjacent flooded field right at the left bank of the river.\nThe water first time hit this area due to damage of a river channel. My host was continuously asking me to come but i was not believing his report. Finally, i decided to take this risk which resulted fruitful. This place is not permanent though as soon as this water finished which may end in a week or so then no chances of ducks ever.

It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, not unlike the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively-larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol. The compensator cuts start about halfway back on the top of the barrel. The two rear cuts are narrower than the two front cuts.

Set traps and various technical methods. Nothing is hidden, everyone know what is the science for hunting. \n \nThen what makes the difference ??????\n \nIts just matter of place selection and information nothing else. One just has multiple choices as reports are good everywhere but a hunter should know his grounds. He must know where duck will provide chance in best possible way. Sometimes it goes wrong too but what we call experience is come out of you.\n \nOther hunting especially upland is a different plan altogether, we go after a definite invitation where there are birds who hardly left there ground but as far as ducks are concerned they are unpredictable always. So chances of coming empty hands are always there.\n \nAnyhow a hunter should enjoy game rather meat collecting. We left the place as soon as we reached a good score despite having an excellent chance for a exceptional bag because we enjoyed our game in a minimum possible time. We should not go for eliminating game from earth, so we warped-up.\n \nSo keep intact better chances will hit anytime. good lucks hunting', ''),

(340553, 'Zimmerstutzen rifles: Are they firearms? Airguns? Neither? Both? Read on to find out Zimmerstutzens are neither fish nor fowl. To firearms collectors, they are considered to be either air- or even non-guns -- things that defy description. To some airgun collectors, they are simply firearms, and no argument about it! Occasionally, you will see a reference to them in a book about something else, but there has never been a book devoted entirely to them. Sometimes, the only information is embedded within the captions of photos and old catalog reproductions. And yet, strangely, many people have both heard of them and know what they are.\r\n\r\nThe Zimmerstutzen or parlor target rifle is a product of the society of the 19th century, when shooting was at its zenith the world over, and shooting champions were the superstars of the day. It was developed in parallel with the centerfire Schutzen rifle, but unlike those early black powder cartridge rifles, which evolved from earlier target muzzleloaders, the Zimmerstutzen was not an outgrowth of anything. It came into being suddenly, in the period immediately following the invention of the rimfire cartridge.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is not incorrect to suggest that the popular rimfire Flobert parlor guns had an influence on the Zimmerstutzen; but where the Floberts tended toward the amusement trade, Zimmers remained rigidly within the sport of precision offhand target shooting. Flobert guns have much more in common with .22 rimfires, although to confuse the situation there are some low-grade Zimmerstutzens based on Flobert actions. But the mainstream Zimmerstutzen rifles laid the groundwork for the precision 10-meter target airguns we enjoy today.\r\n\r\nThe usual explanation for the creation of these super-accurate rifles is that they were developed as off-season trainers for big-bore Schutzen shooters. That makes so much sense that we will accept it here. If there was another reason for their existence, it may never come to light. But once the shooters beheld all they could do with these fine sub-caliber pieces, a brand new facet of shooting began to take shape -- indoor target competition\r\nBecause they are specifically designed for shooting indoors, the caliber range is very small -- nominally 4mm. Don''t confuse this with other German 4mm rimfire and centerfire sub-caliber insert devices that have no relation to Zimmerstutzens, other than the coincidental caliber size. This article will not address those guns.\r\n\r\nZimmer bore sizes actually range from 4mm to 5.45mm, in increments of five-hundredths of a millimeter. There may be other sizes as well, but I have confirmed these through catalog references.\r\n\r\nZimmerstutzens were built to fire either a fixed round that looks like a tiny BB cap or separate ammunition components consisting of caps and balls. The fixed round -- where both case and ball are one piece -- is considered ammunition by BATF; and the guns that use it are, therefore, considered to be firearms in the US.\r\n\r\nThe separate caps for Zimmerstutzens are not ordinary black powder rifle percussion caps. Although there must certainly have been some guns that used them, those guns are not in the mainstream of what we are examining here.\r\n\r\nThere is a special Zimmerstutzen cartridge that has no flanged rim. It looks like an elongated percussion cap, and in the German language it is called a cap. Some references even label it a percussion cap, so perhaps this is where the confusion originates.\r\nThe traditional Zimmerstutzen separate cartridge looks like an empty miniature .22 rimfire case. There is both a short and a long version of this cartridge, to fit two different standard chamber lengths. Priming compound is distributed around the inside base of the case and is covered by a paper vapor barrier. It is not crimped at the end, in the manner of some .22 rimfire blanks, nor does it resemble a cartridge for a nail gun. To the uninitiated, it looks like an empty rimfire case.\r\n\r\nA further dimension to the cartridge is the fact that it used to be produced in low-, medium- and high-power levels to allow the shooter to adjust to the specific range conditions. A match at 10 meters might require less power than one shot at 15 meters -- or at least that''s the thinking.\r\n\r\nZimmer ammunition IS NOT the same as the popular German 6mm BB and CB caps made and sold by RWS for Flobert guns. Those cartridges are much more powerful, to say nothing of their relatively large projectile size.\r\n\r\nThere is an unfortunate laxness in the categorization of ammo types, so both Zimmer rounds and the boxes of separate components often do carry the Flobert name. In fact, even some .22 rimfire ammo makes reference to either Flobert or Zimmerstutzens, so the field is quite ill-defined and ambiguous. Undoubtedly, there has been some crossover through the years to cloud the issue, but I believe this is due more to sloppy cataloging and advertising than to any real confusion on the parts of manufacturers or shooters\r\nThe guns themselves have varying sized bores, so one not only has to match cartridge length and power level, but ball size as well. With fixed ammunition, both case length and ball size must be correct, or accuracy will surely suffer. The same holds true with separate ammo, but you have a greater degree of flexibility when buying the components separately. I have even been able to use long cartridges in a short chamber without affecting the accuracy.\r\n\r\nWith separate ammunition, the tiny precision round lead ball is inserted in the front of a movable breechblock, where the camming action of the rifle''s loading mechanism forces it lightly into the rifling at the rear of the barrel -- what we would refer to as the breech. This is supposed to be a more accurate method of loading than shooting a fixed round, where the crimping of the ball in the case mouth introduces distortion. I haven''t had enough experience to comment on that theory either way.\r\n\r\nGuns that use separate ammunition are invariably front-loading, but that doesn''t mean what most people think. A black powder enthusiast would think of a gun that''s loaded from the muzzle. But, while there may be a few Zimmerstutzens that are true muzzleloaders, the term "front-loading," as used here, implies something much different.\r\n\r\nThe rifle is loaded at the rear of a short rifled insert barrel, through a cutout in, what looks like, the barrel of the rifle. This loading port cutout is located seven or eight inches behind the muzzle, on the underside of the barrel. The firing pin is a long rod extending the full length of the barrel, from the action to the rear of the loading port. In the guns I have examined, this rod smacks the rear of the cartridge directly with enough force to ignite the priming compound. In the rifle I own, you can actually see the back end of this rod, where it connects to the exposed hammer by means of a screw. Other front-loading guns have enclosed actions, but the long firing pin rod is there just the same. When the cartridge goes off, the weight of the rod is the only support for the rear of the case -- the entire rim is exposed at all times\r\nStill other styles of Zimmers load from the true breech of the gun, just like any other firearm. Because of this true breechloading design, these are the guns that use fixed ammunition These rifles have the same short insert rifled barrel as the front loaders, only it''s screwed directly into the action in the conventional manner. At the muzzle end of the insert is a long freebore space running out to the apparent "muzzle" of the long false barrel. At what appears to be the rifle''s muzzle is a large open hole that can fool people into thinking the gun is something it is not.\r\n\r\nIn both instances, keeping the barrel insert short reduces friction on the ball, which is, after all, only powered by a tiny charge of priming compound. Although Zimmer ammo is much less powerful than even .22 rimfire CB caps, velocities tend to be much higher than those found in a modern target air rifle.\r\n\r\nAmmunition design differences require this difference in velocity. Remember that Zimmers shoot round balls, where air rifles use diabolo pellets. Although the two projectiles weigh approximately the same (7.4 grains for the 4.3mm ball versus about 8 grains for the 4.5mm pellet), their ballistic characteristics are very different. Zimmer balls rely on uniformity and a rifling-induced spin for their accuracy; air rifle pellets use uniformity, spin AND the high air drag created by the open diabolo skirt. Zimmer balls leave the barrel at between 800 and 1,000 f.p.s.; target air rifle pellets are traveling 550-650 f.p.s.\r\n\r\nThe short barrel insert of the Zimmerstutzen also means the ball leaves the rifle''s influence quickly, a trait that many target shooters believe offers a significant advantage in accuracy potential. The top 10-meter air rifles made today all employ similar short rifled barrel sections, although none as short as the Zimmer, because they require certain minimum lengths to allow their powerplant to build velocity.\r\n\r\nFront-loaded rifles built prior to about 1909 often use a non-cammed "spoon" to load the separate ball and cartridge. These spoons are actually the handles attached to the same movable breech piece and function in the same way as the later, more complex, mechanisms; but the simpler spoons require more manipulation on the part of the shooter when loading the gun.\r\n\r\nAn article written by Tom Anderson for American Airgunner magazine in 1991 tells of locating an older (pre-1900) Zimmer at a local gun show. The gun was missing its breech spoon, so the author had to fabricate one from scratch, judging sizes and tolerances from the parts on either end of the missing items. He made his new breech to accept modern pistol primers, which sounds like a very reasonable idea.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty he encountered in the whole project was obtaining lead balls of the correct size for his 4.3mm bore. In the end, he resorted to using round ball airgun ammunition of 4.5mm. Although his bore measured 0.172", he shot a ball of 0.177" diameter through it -- with a resultant accuracy of only 2-1/2" at 33 feet. Anyone who shoots round balls in muzzleloaders might predict such poor accuracy from the amount of lead that had to be shaved as each ball was driven down the bore.\r\n\r\nAny Zimmerstutzen in good order using the correct ball should be able to group 10 shots at a distance of 15 meters, or nearly 50 feet, in a single hole not much larger than the hole made by one .177 wadcutter pellet! Such groups are often shot from rested rifles, and sometimes even turn up in a match -- fired from the offhand position!\r\n\r\nThe rifling in these guns is quite fine, with 12 lands and grooves being common. The bores were honed before the cutter made its first pass, in the manner of the great barrelmakers of the previous century. Even Zimmers made at the end of the era, in 1935, are as carefully built as if Harry Pope personally supervised each one. Although this level of work is not impossible to replicate today, it would be remarkable if anyone did!\r\n\r\nMy own interest in these rifles began in the early 1960s, when I read about them in an article in Guns & Ammo. From that moment on, there''s been a special place in my heart for the guns, although it took me another 30-plus years to acquire one.\r\n\r\nThey are somewhat scarce here in the US; so when the Army sent me to Germany in the 1970s, I was very hopeful of finally locating one. Surely the country of origin would be rich with Zimmers just waiting for an eager collector, like me.\r\n\r\nWrong! Germany, in the early 1970s, wanted nothing at all to do with her past. Everyone was on a modernization kick. They were tossing out all their antiques and rapidly acquiring furniture and possessions that looked like they belonged in a British mod movie or a dentist''s office. Lucite coffee tables with chrome legs and pastel leather furniture displaced the solid wooden furniture of the early part of the century (and earlier!). Although I pestered the local gun shops, there wasn''t a Zimmer to be found. Alas, I returned to the States without my rifle.\r\n\r\nThe tour wasn''t a complete failure, though. In the historic town of Rothenberg on the Tauber, I stumbled onto modern adult airguns by accident while searching for my Zimmer. Fortunately, Germany was (and still is) quite active as a center of precision airguns, so there has never been a dry spell for me with airguns from that day on.\r\n\r\nThe Zimmerstutzens I seek are the period pieces from about 1910 to 1935. Those were the glory days. They lasted right up to the point when the German legislature put an end to the civilian federal shooting program, in preparation for war. Rifles made during this period represent the top level of both design and accuracy. They fully rival the finest Schutzens for craftsmanship and decoration.\r\n\r\nSo, after seeing a fine Zimmer at the big Baltimore gun show in March of 1997, I resolved to take action. It took a few more months to acquire a rifle, but all that time I also vowed to do more than just own and shoot my own rifle. I would help spread the word about these poorly documented guns, so others might enjoy them as well.\r\n\r\nThe gun I finally bought was as different as any Zimmer ever could be, yet it fits exactly into the mainstream of the type. It was made by none other than C. Stiegele of Munich. And, it has a swamped barrel -- the only one I have ever heard of!\r\n\r\nThere is a definite swelling at the muzzle, which is one sign of a better barrelmaker. It''s not easy to taper eight octagon flats by one-tenth-inch diameter over five or six linear inches of iron, while the rest of the run is parallel. Most makers never bother to do it, but the few who did marked their guns with a hallmark of quality that can never be erased by the ravages of time or neglect.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of the rifle wasn''t at all what I had expected. The whole thing was too short -- almost a carbine. At 41 inches, this is the shortest Zimmerstutzen I have ever seen or even heard about. It looks more like a Jaeger stalking rifle than a target gun. I was momentarily crestfallen at the thought of yet another gun failing to assuage my lust for the true Zimmer.\r\n\r\nThen I hoisted it to my shoulder and felt the balance. All my angst dissolved, when the fine balance of the rifle played itself out in my hands. This is actually a perfectly balanced offhand target rifle. The extra metal of the swamped barrel lends just enough mass at the muzzle for the rifle to stabilize in my off hand -- which finds the exact balance point of the stock quite readily. Apparently, this rifle was made for a person proportioned much like me.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had no idea what size balls were needed for this gun, nor was I aware of any source for them in the US. But I''ve been a muzzleloader and a bullet-caster long enough to know how to begin.\r\n\r\nI removed the short barrel insert to slug the bore. Being an airgunner paid off here, because I have many thousand round lead balls in nearly the correct caliber. A Gamo .176-inch diameter pure lead ball was used. Tapping it into the breech shaved off a ring of lead that was uniform, which means the slug was centered as it entered the bore.\r\n\r\nThe ball passed through the bore without any loose spots, indicating a uniform barrel diameter all the way through. With some of the button-rifled barrels today, that''s uncommon. There are almost always loose spots and constrictions, where the metal springs back after the pass of the button, but this barrel had been cut-rifled in the traditional way -- one groove at a time.\r\n\r\nThe ball emerged showing 12 lands and grooves, with a bore diameter of 0.1687 inches. Knowing how hard it is to accurately mike such a small object -- especially one made of soft lead, I allowed for some inaccuracy in the reading.\r\n\r\nThe rifle is marked with the number five on the barrel jacket, just in front of the forearm. That''s a common place for the ball size to be marked. Since this is a Stiegele, the size should be theirs, but as noted in the table pm page 36, Stiegele sizes correspond to the new size designations for balls between 4mm and 5mm. Size five is 4.20mm, which converts to 0.168". So I figured the bore size I got from slugging was in the right ballpark.\r\n\r\nHowever, the marked ball size is nearly one full thousandth UNDER the true bore size, according to my measurements, and that didn''t sound too good. I expected it to be at least equal to the bore size or even a thousandth over -- not under. So, with the wisdom that all tinkerers possess, I figured I knew more about the gun than its maker and went with ball size seven -- which is 4.30mm. That comes out to 0.16985".\r\n\r\nMy next job was to locate ammunition. A call to Col. Brett Boyd at the Single Shot Exchange netted me both a subscription to his fine monthly publication and the phone number for John Gary Staup. Gary is a Zimmerstutzen collector and noted authority, along with his duties as Secretary of the Single-Shot Association. He informed me that The Old Western Scrounger in California carries RWS Zimmerstutzen ammunition, so I went on the Internet to check them out.\r\n\r\nSure enough, they do carry some sizes of lead balls; but, as I didn''t yet have the ball sizes table to work from, I placed an order on the phone -- telling them that I needed 4.30mm balls. Let them figure out which number that converts to.\r\n\r\nGary also thought that my Zimmer might use the long caps because it was possible to completely chamber the fixed ammunition that came with the rifle into the rear of the movable breech. So, I placed an order for several hundred balls and long caps. You can contact The Old Western Scrounger at 800-877-2666 for orders, or 916-459-5445 for customer service/catalogs.\r\n\r\nAfter some initial shooting, and after I didn''t get the accuracy I''d been hoping for, I went back and discovered my mistake with the ball sizes. I should have gone with the Stiegele number five ball from the start. In a second call to The Old Western Scrounger, I was informed that they only carry separate balls in sizes seven and larger, so there wasn''t any way I could get size five from them.\r\n\r\nI had also discovered during shooting that the long cases were both hard to fully seat and to eject from the movable breech. A look at a fired case with a 10X jeweler''s loupe told me why. The cases were being swaged down at the mouth about 1-2 millimeters back. They were too long! My rifle was actually chambered for the shorts. Fortunately, The Old Western Scrounger had shorts in stock, so I ordered several boxes to continue my testing. The longs will still work; but they''re hard to seat, and sometimes they don''t go off on the first try if they haven''t been seated all the way.\r\n\r\nI next faxed Frankonia-Jagdt in Germany, to see if they had the separate number five balls I required. Apparently, either my German wasn''t that specific or they did not have what I needed, for they faxed back a price for the loaded ammunition only. I do believe that the German firm of Haendler & Naterman (H&N) still makes the smaller balls, but there isn''t enough of a demand to warrant their importation into this country.\r\n\r\nI am having a special barrel made for my rifle to enable the use of .177 lead balls, which are readily available from both H&N and Gamo in the US. The original barrel will remain intact for posterity, but the new .177 barrel should prove to be far more accurate.\r\n\r\nCONT. POST # 2', ''),

(340554, ' System Stiegele\r\nGary Staup also has a large collection of original Zimmerstutzen paper, and from that he has learned that the front-loading action that characterizes the classic rifle was invented by the Stiegele company prior to 1910, for it appears in a catalog of that date. I was really excited to learn that, for, as mentioned earlier, my rifle is marked "C. Stiegele -- Munchen" on the top barrel flat. By the front loading port are two oval stamps declaring the action to be "System Stiegele." In German, the word system is used similarly to how we use the term action, so these stamps identify a genuine Stiegele action. \r\nCarl Stiegele was a manufacturer of fine Schutzen rifles, so it is only natural that he would also include Zimmerstutzens in his line. Many of his customers would own both a Schutzen for regular shooting and a Zimmer for the inclement months, in the same way that military high-power shooters today sometimes bed a 10-meter air rifle action into a regulation M1A stock for additional training. They would want the same heft and feel in both rifles, so the full training experience would not be lost when using the indoor gun. How better to accomplish that than to have both rifles made by the same maker?\r\n\r\nStiegele''s action is a floating breechblock that swings into alignment with the barrel, then cams into lockup with an easily operated lever. The camming action forces the separate ball into the rifling at the rear of the barrel. Both the cam and ball seat are precisely machined, so each ball is seated exactly the same. This promotes accuracy, which is the name of the game.\r\n\r\nStiegele wasn''t alone in patenting the floating breech action. There were several others who had their own proprietary designs. Some of them even include automatic ejectors for the fired cartridge, a feature the Stiegele lacks -- at least on the example I own.\r\n\r\nZimmers were not proofed, which seems reasonable, if you think about it. The tiny 4mm cartridge contains no powder, so it can never reach a high pressure -- even in terms of rimfires. Almost anyone could make them -- and they did! In Germany, you can see 4mm rifles built on surplus Mauser bolt actions, Martini dropping blocks, Flobert rolling blocks, Aydt falling blocks and just about anything else that can hold a barrel and sights. Some load at the rear of the barrel like a conventional breechloader, but the front-loading mechanism has always seemed to me to be the classic style.\r\n\r\nHere in the US, though, we usually encounter the more elaborate examples, probably because the plain ones would have been less desirable to bring back from Europe. Although they could not be said to be common in this country, there are a fair number of them in circulation. I believe that the lack of knowledge about the gun is what keeps them in circulation, and also keeps the prices in line. After all, who wants a gun they think they can''t shoot? Perhaps a few diehard collectors don''t mind hanging them on the wall, but the unique style of the Zimmer seems to invite shooting -- even if only infrequently as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nWhile prices vary widely due to a lack of market exposure and general knowledge, there aren''t many people who don''t recognize the inherent value of these fine target arms when they see them. Often, this works against the person who is seeking one, as an owner may ascribe a highly inflated value, because of the gun''s supposed rarity. I will make no attempt to give a detailed price guide here, but there are some simple guidelines to follow.\r\n\r\nRifles made from the better actions command higher prices, almost without regard to their condition. Almost anyone can tell the difference between a simple Flobert rolling block and a fine Aydt dropping block action. The former will almost invariably have the less elaborate rear sight and sport almost no stock or metalwork embellishments. The latter will probably have a variable diopter rear sight and at least some stock work. For guns of the same general condition, I would value the Aydt or Martini at least twice as high as the Flobert.\r\n\r\nMaker names are important, too. Some of the better ones are: Stiegele, Aydt, Haenel, Martini, and Bayerl, to name a few. Mauser and, quite surprisingly, J. G. Anschutz, are a couple of makers of the plainer, lower-grade bolt-action guns.\r\n\r\nFancy decorations also come into play. The better guns will at least have a checkered wrist, and perhaps some simple lines of scrollwork in the wood. The schnabel may be fluted, as well.\r\n\r\nLook for a fluted barrel on the higher grades. This is a non-essential piece of work that denotes a labor of pure love. Some of the metal fluting is very fancy, with smaller flutes and decorative cuts inside the larger ones. Also look for decorative work around the muzzles of fluted-barrel rifles. And examine the fineness of the metal preparation and bluing on these guns, as it is extremely time-consuming to polish the small detail areas within the flutes.\r\n\r\nAs the decorations increase, look for finely engraved hunting scenes or target shooting scenes on both sides of the lock. The deeper the engraving, the higher the grade. Top Zimmers will be engraved with bas relief. The finest examples will also have contrasting metals and mother-of-pearl inlaid into the stocks and the metalwork. Look for German silver and real silver on the best guns.\r\n\r\nA plain Mauser or Flobert rifle in average working condition might command $300-400 today. In excellent shape, the same gun may be worth as much as $600, or so. They don''t really rise much above that -- and only that high for a really pristine gun. A mid-grade rifle from a top maker might start at twice these figures, and increase even more as condition rises.\r\n\r\nFor the very finest examples with lots of decorative work, price is determined by the seller and the buyer on a per-case basis. In other words -- don''t ask! Of course, these numbers are determined by the relative experience of both the seller and the buyer. Strange things can and do happen every day.\r\n\r\nBeware of guns that have been repaired. Front sights are especially vulnerable. Often one or both protective ears have been broken off, which usually means the thin post has been destroyed as well. The removable front sights are subject to someone having lost them over the years, and a cowboy gunsmith replacing them with something completely inappropriate, like a Lyman 17A. The rear diopter is missing in a significant number of cases, often being replaced by a lesser grade sight. The rear sight in the middle of the barrel is another casualty. Sometimes all that remains is a dovetail, but on my rifle there are two exposed screw holes that look incongruous.\r\n\r\nBesides sights, stocks are another high failure-rate item on a Zimmer. Usually, the wrist will have broken as the result of a fall when someone tried to stand the gun in the corner on its butt. Sometimes, it''s the thumbrest on the side of the wrist. The acorn finial is often missing from the top of the buttplate -- I believe as the result of curiosity. Someone removes it and it''s lost.\r\n\r\nBesides their cost and general lack of publicity, another thing that keeps Zimmers out of the mainstream is the cost of the ammunition. From The Old Western Scrounger, 100 rounds will set you back about $7.50 or more. That may not seem like a lot to a centerfire shooter, but any .22 rimfire shooter knows several sources for a 500-round brick at about $10. Never mind that they don''t personally use such bargain ammunition for anything other than plinking, the price sticks in their mind. And airgunners, who today routinely out-shoot both Zimmers and .22 rimfire match shooters at ranges out to 50 yards, use pellets costing only $15 or less for 1,000 world-class rounds. Even the top Olympic airgun shooters are shooting for pennies compared to Zimmer ammunition. So you''ve gotta love ''em to wanna shoot ''em!\r\n\r\nA sad note \r\nOne sad side note to the cost and supposed unavailability of 4mm ammunition is that some American-owned Zimmerstutzens have been "converted" by the good ol'' boys to shoot "real" ammunition, completely disregarding the danger to both rifle and shooter, alike. Remember -- these guns are not proofed!\r\n\r\nPeople drill out the chambers of the movable breech sections on the front-loading rifles to accept the .22 rimfire cartridge, and they install short sections of .22 rimfire barrel in the muzzles of vintage Zimmers to get them shooting once again. With breechloaders, it''s even easier -- just install a short barrel section with the chamber already present. This job can quite literally be done at the kitchen table, excepting the threading of the new insert barrel. The resultant accuracy will probably be atrocious, however.\r\n\r\nAny such conversion spells death to the rifle. Not only does it ruin any collector value, defacing a fine target gun that could have continued shooting accurately for centuries, it also endangers anyone foolish enough to shoot it with the much more potent .22 rimfire ammunition. Swelled chambers and burst cases will be the rule with the front loaders, as the case has nothing supporting its base except the firing pin! With breechloaders, there is more to back up the rim, but the gun is still not proofed.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of fine guns through this kind of conversion causes an increase in value to the remaining supply, but that''s not how collectors view it. A .22 rimfire is just about the cheapest firearm known -- why ruin a fine vintage gun to get one? If you find a Zimmer that has been converted in this way, DO NOT attempt to shoot it with .22 rimfire ammunition. Even the lowly .22 CB cap has much more priming compound to launch the 26-grain bullet it carries than the 4mm rimfire cap has for its 7-grain ball. At the very best, you will have an extraction problem. Either make the parts to restore the gun to its original caliber or leave it alone. Conversions of this sort make great wall-hangers and parts guns.\r\n\r\nThe sport of shooting Zimmerstutzens \r\nIn the 1960 Shooter''s Bible, there''s an ad for a drop-in Zimmerstutzen barreled action for the Anschutz 1407 target rifle. They tout the 4mm system as "an inexpensive and quiet indoor training system for your target rifle." Imagine that -- a drop-in inexpensive indoor trainer conversion for an already-inexpensive indoor trainer! The Zimmer is accurate to 50 feet, which is also prime .22 rimfire territory. So here is a quieter, cheaper (in 1960) way to shoot your .22. What would come next -- pellets?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, pellet rifles were fast becoming more accurate in 1960. Soon, they would exceed even the .22 rimfire at short ranges. And, when you take into account their vastly superior range safety characteristics, they wouldn''t take very long to displace the rimfire altogether at the shorter distances. In the recent 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, a full one-third of the shooting events were for airguns.\r\n\r\nThe rules of Zimmerstutzen competition appear to have changed over the years. On page 336 of the 1960 Shooter''s Bible, the rules for competitive Zimmerstutzen matches are given, and the range is stated as 15 meters. Another reference I have says 10 meters. A German catalog from the 1920s says the distance is 10 paces, so who knows for sure? Today, Zimmer shooters shoot at 15 meters, which is close enough to 50 feet that it will work.\r\n\r\nThe Stoeger rules go on to specify that the rifle may not weigh more than 16 lbs., which seems strange, since we would expect the weight to be specified in kilograms, not pounds, in a 1960 publication. Perhaps the author was borrowing from a much earlier rule book. Curiously, it also says that handrests are forbidden in competition, yet Gary Staup has in his collection a beautiful Haenel Zimmer with a short handrest.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported many times that these guns are very quiet. I''m sorry, but I will have to disagree. The front-loader I have is just as noisy as a .22 rimfire shooting CB caps. Outdoors it might not be bad, but in an enclosed space -- watch out. I always wear hearing protection when I shoot my Zimmer. Perhaps the true breechloaders are quieter because their long freebores act like silencers, but I would still advise hearing protection in enclosed spaces. \r\n\r\nThe sights\r\nBesides the caliber, sights are one of the defining characteristics of a Zimmerstutzen. They also serve to separate the informal 4mm sporting rifles from the far more serious target models. A serious Zimmer has a rear sight that looks like a satellite dish!\r\n\r\nAmong military pilots, the size of the wristwatch is a faux status symbol. With Zimmerstutzen owners, it''s both the size and number of functions contained in the rear sight. After all, these aren''t magnum guns -- so velocity and muzzle energy are not important. And, accuracy is a given. But you gotta have sights, and if you want to be respected and envied, the one in the back has to be big!\r\n\r\nFirst, there''s the sheer diameter of the diopter housing, which can top three inches in extreme cases. The one on my rifle is a rather conservative 55mm, or just over 2-1/8 inches wide. On an inexpensive gun, there is usually a deeply cupped metal dish measuring about one inch across. These are only found on lesser guns or sometimes as replacements for lost originals. I don''t know why, but a lot of original diopter sights are missing from Zimmers when you find them. It''s easy to say someone has borrowed them for their Schutzen rifle, but how were THOSE sights lost? It will remain a mystery, I guess.\r\n\r\nBuilt into the better grades of rear sights is a diopter adjustment wheel, with six or more selectable hole sizes. The wheel is controlled by a precise spring-loaded detent, so each diopter aligns perfectly. This feature enables the shooter to adjust for the light on a particular range. You want to shoot with the least amount of light that enables you to see the target clearly. Lowering the light level forces your sighting eye to align with the exact center of the hole, which is where the greatest amount of light can be perceived. This forces your brain to automatically select the same spot to position your head (and eye) each time, which eliminates the shooter parallax problem -- remember B-R-A-S-S from your marksmanship training? This takes care of the spot-weld.\r\n\r\nThe very best rear sights can also have a selection of colored filters to further sharpen the sight picture. And, magnification was also available, in the form of a glass with no more than 1.5X, which allows older eyes to better acquire the tiny front sight.\r\n\r\nDespite the variations in size and features, though, all the aperture sights I have seen and read about share one thing in common. They all adjust with a clock-type key. Original keys most often fit more than one size post; but if they aren''t with the rifle, as is often the case, a couple of plain old clock keys serve the purpose just fine. Most rear sights have three square posts -- one each for windage and elevation and the final one to remove the sight from the rifle.\r\n\r\nThe other type of rear sight found on some Zimmerstutzens has me completely puzzled. Not all rifles have them, but a fair number are provided with open notch rear sights, located just behind the middle of the barrel jacket. Some of these are very finely adjustable, but others appear to be simple express-type sights with wide "V" notches. There are even folding blades of varying heights, similar to what would be found on an African big bore rifle of the previous century! I have found no explanation for the existence of this sight, which seems to be redundant, in light of the enormously precise rear aperture invariably mounted behind it.\r\n\r\nThe front sight is just as specialized as the rear, if not as adjustable. The standard is an extremely thin post with a tiny round bead on top. The shooter simply centers this bead in the bull, while looking through the rear aperture. No thought is required to use sights like this -- they are as automatic as a scope, once the shooter understands how they work.\r\n\r\nSome people avoid aperture sights, believing they must somehow align BOTH the front and rear elements with the target, but that would be almost impossible. Instead, it''s almost like looking at something through a red dot sight -- whatever you touch with the dot (front bead) is what you hit.\r\n\r\nAnother standard item for the front sights are a pair of protective "ears" that surround the fragile post almost completely. Complete globes are sometimes seen, but the ears are more common. They allow cleaning of the tiny post, and so represent a better design, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAlthough the actual post looks like a pin to the shooter, it has some front-to-back dimension to give it some strength. I have seen far fewer of these sight units missing from guns, although it does happen, and can be troublesome to remedy. More often, they have been damaged in a fall. Why the Germans didnt use the replaceable element-type globe sights that were at least a quarter of a century old (or more) by that time is another mystery.\r\n\r\nOn the finer Zimmers, the front post has four elements with different shapes. Usually, these will be three different beads and a single square post. They rotate on a wheel and are locked in position by a spring detent or friction lever. A clock key similar to the one used to adjust the rear diopter is used to select the desired post, whose wheel hub protrudes from the right of the sight base as a square post. Besides the caliber, sights are one of the defining characteristics of a Zimmerstutzen. They also serve to separate the informal 4mm sporting rifles from the far more serious target models. A serious Zimmer has a rear sight that looks like a satellite dish!\r\n\r\nThe Zimmerstutzen''s influence on airguns\r\nIn the German catalogs from the 1920s and earlier, which Gary Staup was kind enough to furnish for reference, I can see parallel lines of style and development between airguns and Zimmers of the period. The stocks, sights, general proportions and even the terminology of the two are remarkably similar. As an example, any airgunner knows what a Bugelspanner is -- it''s an airgun that cocks by means of a movable triggerguard. It''s literally a "triggerguard-cocker." But in the German catalogs, ANY gun that cocks by using the triggerguard is a Bugelspanner, including a lot of firearms and, of course, many Zimmerstutzens. A Ruger Number 1 would be a Bugelspanner.\r\n\r\nThe airgun form of the Bugelspanner has existed since at least the 1840s, and firearms aficionados can even see a "Sharps" air rifle, which Christian Sharps presented to his 10-year-old daughter, on page 108 of Frank Sellers famous book, Sharps Firearms. This rifle (more probably a smoothbore) bears a strong resemblance to the European Buglespanners of that period.\r\n\r\nAirgun collector Don Raitzer has an airgun Bugelspanner that even has the sporting rear sight midway up the barrel, like many Zimmers had originally. Ironically, Don''s gun is missing its rear diopter, just like many Zimmerstutzens.\r\n\r\nCollector and historian Larry Hannusch has an even more elaborate airgun with both rear sights. This one is decorated very much like the next-to-highest grade Zimmerstutzens, and is difficult to recognize as an airgun at all. Larry correctly considers his piece to be a parlor airgun; but, except for how it is powered, a Zimmer collector would recognize it just as readily.\r\n\r\nAirgunners would accept both Don''s and Larry''s guns as simply elaborate versions of the airgun Bugelspanner that is so well-recognized to enthusiasts. Most would be quick to point out that Zimmerstutzens are firearms -- not airguns.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, I find the similarities between target airguns of the late 1800s and Zimmerstutzens suggest strongly that these were just two different ways of powering the same kind of gun -- a target rifle. I''m not implying that the airguns were ever used in formal Zimmerstutzen matches; I don''t think they were. But, if this trend of parallel styling had continued long into this century, I think the two would have blended into one. It would certainly be possible today to make an air-powered Zimmerstutzen that could compete at all levels. In fact, the Feinwerkbau 300 Tyrolean is such a gun, just to name one.\r\n\r\nThe Zimmerstutzen is one of life''s little curiosities. A thing that is difficult to categorize, yet is almost universally revered. If you appreciate the art of the gunmaker and have a yen for old world craftsmanship, this little rifle might be just what you''ve been looking for.\r\n\r\nby Tom Gaylord \r\nCopyright PyramydAir.com ©2011.

(340682, 'HUNTING  PHOTOGRAPHY - How can you capture good game photo. HUNTING  PHOTOGRAPHY.\n\nThis thread is not about choosing a camera. There are plenty of good photographers, magazines, web-links and camera shop owners who can help you with that.\nI do have one piece of advice that applies to everyone: Learn to use your camera by studying the hunting photography instructions.\n\nHunting is all about collecting memories, and even though the memories of the hunt remain in your head, nothing captures a moment in time like photographs do. No matter how good a story you tell, pictures are the best way to share the experience with your family and friends, too.\n\n My best advice is to get in the habit of taking the best pictures you can; the more you take, the better you''ll get. Then, on those rare occasions when you shoot a really spectacular trophy, you''ll have the gear, you''ll know how to set up the shots, and you''ll end up with a photographic record that will last the rest of your life. The only things worse than no photos are bad photos.\n\nHunting Photography Tips\n·	Clean the animal and put him in a natural position, also try to remove the blood from bird, or change side.\n·	Sit behind the animal.\n·	Put the antlers or horns against the sky or a natural background.\n·	Keep the light behind the camera.\n·	Fill the frame.\n·	Keep spare batteries in pack, Film Rolls, Memory Cards.\n·	If possible one spare camera also.\n\nPosition the Shot Game.\n\nHunters almost always look at the camera when taking a trophy shot, but consider looking down to admire the animal or look away to admire the beautiful country it lived in. Sometimes these are the best photos. \nAnd if you have time, take some shots of packing, dragging or carrying the animal away from where you killed it.\n\nThe best way to position an animal is to fold the legs underneath it and set it up on its belly. This will enable you to get the head a bit higher, which will accentuate the antlers or horns. \n\nWild boar hunters often prop the mouth by stick, open so the tusks show. Once you get the animal posed in a natural and attractive posture, clean it up. If water is available, use plenty of it to get the blood off.\n\nMake sure you pick the best side (exit holes are usually messier than entrance holes). You can disguise some blood with a bit of dust.\nPay particular attention to the animal''s face. If you''ve made a good chest shot, you will probably have blood leaking out of the mouth, and it might be necessary to keep wiping it between shots. \nTake the time to do it. Whatever you do, make sure that the animal''s tongue isn''t hanging out--one of the greatest "no-no''s" of trophy photography.\n\nTake a look at the whole scene, including yourself, before the shutter snaps. Make sure you don''t have blood on your hands or face, and take a moment to make sure your clothing is in order. The best place to position yourself is behind the animal but off to the side. \n\nYou don''t want to be the backdrop for the shot game. If you can''t easily reach out and touch the animal, then you''re too far back. Use a minimum of hands and fingers to hold the trophy. \n\nA common fault, especially if you lay your rifle on the animal for the picture, is to have the photo appear as if the rifle barrel is pointed at your head or someone else''s head. Be mindful of that when composing the shot. Make sure all firearms are unloaded.\n\nUsually the best shot will be from a low angle. Try to lie on the ground to take a trophy shot, shooting up at the animal to accentuate it. The best course is to shoot from as many different angles as time allows. A careful look through the lens will tell you what you''re getting. \nIf someone else is taking your photos, never assume that they see it the same way you do. While they may come up with a good shot you didn''t think of, always make sure you get the shot you want by checking the angle and zoom yourself. \n\nGet behind the animal as if you were following the trail and just discovered the fallen quarry, looking at the animal and not the camera. This can be a wonderful photograph.\n\nLIGHTING\nThe best background is none at all. Having just sky behind your trophy really brings out the size. The next best situation is a uniform background--a green hillside/plantation.  If these aren''t available, get your trophy as far away from the background as possible and focus on the animal. In most cases, the background will fade away. In really tough situations, use yourself as the background. \nDirect sunlight is a problem, but that can be overcome by using a slow-speed film that likes a lot of light. Watch for harsh shadows, and take a couple of shots with the flash--even though it seems you don''t need it. \nCaps almost always cast a shadow on the hunter''s face, and daytime flash use (called "fill flash") will allow you to see the person''s face in the final picture.\n\nSELF TIMER\nOne of the most important features on your camera is the self-timer. Use your cameras a lot in this mode, not only when you are alone but also so a hunting buddy can get in the picture with you. The best way to use a self-timer is on a tripod, but you can build up a perfectly acceptable camera stand with packs, rocks, logs, stone, woods whatever.', ''),

It is one of the most longing debate going on about duty other than it being an outclass ergonomic reliable and accurate pistol.\nExists on multiple batches, even though company has been made to notice this since 2009 1st quarter, still the new batches coming out are having this buldge.\nPlease note this buldge exist there even when the pistol is brand new.\nStrange but true, although supposedly this budlge will not increase with round count, yet it is still there in NIB pistol. More on it, people have noticed this buldge/swell on their P-07''s in most cases right after 1st shoot while cleaning, however after counter checking it was found on NIBs too. In many cases people have gone 3k + round count and the buldge has not increased/aggravated. \nCompany has said that it is merely cosmetic, and has nothing to do with performance. \nReported frames have been sent to company for inspection, and after detailed check by armourers, they have concluded that internal components of frame which take the stress are intact and working perfectly.

Well my collection era has spread over all the seasons i have seen so far and by simply prioritizing to collect any item related to arms and ammunition i am able to collect few things. My focus throughout  the struggle remains to be slow & study and never to become hyper or play foul what may come as sound character guarantees continuous success. If you do not cheat and remain persistent you are rewarded by God , for which i am rewarded much ahead of my thoughts.My father in his life  owned James Purdey shot gun which was fraudulently taken away by a famous gun collector of Islamabad, this conduct pinched us a lot. Being a victim of such mistrust i never tried to see my dreams come true at the cost of others. Above all my friends,acquaintances who contributed in bulk gets more of credit for this collection & my offer till today is still valid that they may retrieve what they have sold on me at the same rate which i had offered at that time. With passing age and responsibilities my rhythm or madness to grab old antique pieces has been over shadowed but still the process is on. As i have already written some where that people are having much superior collection which they have yet not made public, they are keeping it for own satisfaction same is my case.Once i took few pieces to Chacha Karimu, armorer at Gizri for some advice he was pleased to see them, rest i do not want to display them at any place . You mentioned about GOOD Bucks, i do require but not at the cost ofGOOD Buck-ups from people like you. \r\nSir grateful for kind guidance in identifying the place to get Co2 cylinders and for all your sincere offers,regards', ''),

(341051, 'Spirit of Hunting : Russian Bear Hunters In Russia there were hunters which bagged bears with a spear (Russian  word for the bear spear is "rogatina" and the hunter is called  "rogatchik"). Different people of Russian society from the ordinary  peasant up to the noble aristocrat were keen participants of this very  dangerous method of hunting, with a few people being professionals. \n       They have to be a brave and strong person, and have to anticipate  the unexpected bear behaviour. The great specialist of bear hunting was  the main huntsman of the great Duke Mihail  Andrievskiy. In the magazine ("Nature and Hunting"  1894) he published a  well known and very interesting article about bear hunting. He described every detail and all aspects of this hunting:  bear behaviour, psychology and strategy fighting, construction of spear  and so on. Vadim a russian artist painted this picture according to this article and  following some advice with bear specialist zoologists.[ATTACH=CONFIG]1403[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1404[/ATTACH]', ''),

(341117, 'Maintenance: Emergency Shotgun Care The last batch of Ed Red solvent that I mixed, has finished recently. Instead of mixing more, I tried to be a little experimental. In search for a perfect/cheap/readily available lubricant and solvent, I tried three liquids.\r\n\r\nKerosene: It''s the most rudimentary solvent. It will remove the basic carbon stains from the gun''s gas piston but not recommended for the good cleaning. It evaporated quickly, therefore next to zero lubricant value. Didn''t tried it as a lubricant.\r\n\r\nDiesel: The next thing was diesel. It''s an excellent solvent. It removed the stubborn stains. To me the stubborn stains  are the ones that are formed right below  the gas ports, on the magazine tube. Diesel removed them. I could feel a little bit of lubrication on the magazine tube so I fired 10 cartridges from the gun and then removed the barrel to inspect it. There was considerably less carbon fouling on the magazine tube. And I just wiped the gun clean  with a dry patch. I didnt feel the need to use diesel as solvent again as the dry patch wipe-out cleaned it all. I am impressed with its solvent properties, but I am little doubtful on its lubrication (for emergency) properties. \r\n\r\nWD-40: I have tried it once on the gun. It worked okay. I have a question, why we keep calling it water dispenser when its promo says that it cleans, lubricates and protects????? Isn''t it supposed to be used only on water soiled articles????', ''),
(341119, ' WD-40 is a water displacement product and penetrating spray. Its will not provide sufficient lubrication, in fact it''ll clear any oil and dry out the mechanics of the firearm.\n\nIt also will not properly clean any cacked on deposits, etc... but it will make it look aesthetically clean.', ''),
(341120, ' Edit. Double post. Find below.', ''),
(341122, ' [B]AoA Hamid Sb.[/B]\r\n\r\nExcellent Topic Sir. In the absence of a proper CLP (Cleaner, lubricant and a Protectant) I too have experimented a bit and found Kerosene to be a good solvent however it evaporates quickly and leaves the metal too dry therefore it can actually promote rust instead of preventing it and offers no lubrication whatsoever. however for a solvent it is pretty good and can cut hard caked deposits when allowed to sit for a while coupled with a double doze of elbow grease.\r\n\r\nas far as Diesel is concerned, since it is from the same family as Kerosene, I''ve found that their solvent abilities are quiet similar to each other and also quiet similar to a dedicated CLP. With that, Diesel also offers a light amount of lubrication as well. in my experience, whatever a specialty solvent can accomplish in terms of cleaning, diesel/kerosene can as well with a Scotch Brite Pad and some extra elbow grease.\r\n\r\nIf you look into the technical data sheet of a CLP. you''ll find that they mostly contain kerosene or some other petroleum based solvent (for cleaning) along with a mineral/synthetic oil (for lubrication) and heavy chain petroleum based wax (for protecting). now its the quality of the individual components that determine the overall quality of a CLP.\r\n\r\nWD40 is what I would call a rudimentary CLP and it does exactly as advertised. it cleans, lubricates and protects. Gun Enthusiasts have been using WD40 on firearms for a long time with no ill effects whatsoever. only problem with WD40 is that it is not good for long time storage as it has been known to gum up. now one must understand that it is not WD40''s fault. it was never designed for long term storage to begin with. Every mineral oil will gum up over time, a phenomenon called open air oxidation. it happens with all mineral oils regardless of the quality. you need special additives such as oxidation inhibitors to resist open air oxidation. blend that with a quality mineral/synthetic oil and you have a lubricant that will not gum up.\r\n\r\nnow coming back to diesel, I too have experienced this. when you clean a firearm with Diesel and use no specialty lubricant afterwards (meaning just a light coat of Diesel thats all) the firearms remain noticeably clean when used. to be honest, cleaning afterwards becomes a breeze. it could be due to the fact that Diesel has a very low flash point and it probably flashes off  the moment you fire the weapon. since the firearm is now operating totally dry, the fouling/carbon/gunk has no medium available to stick to. making cleaning alot easier. to be honest, just a dry cloth is good enough to clean such a firearm.\r\n\r\nas for the downside, I would say, Diesel is no way near a lubricant when it comes to lubrication therefore I cannot comment on the long term usage and subsequent wear and tear associated with Diesel. for a cleaner, emergency solvent and an emergency lubricant it is good enough for the job.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(341466, ' @Prince, very nice bags as of recent pics which i just saw ... and as i read the shooting story, the hitting seemed more than good, getting consistently 5 or 8 birds from each flock is not bad at all. Our flocks arrival position was very interesting and frequent, but hitting ratio not that high, maybe becoz we were two guns per blind, and averaged about 3 per flock which was not our usual norm but also because of high level of excitement. But as the flocks were real huge, I found we would have been better off with 3-4 guns in a blind to take advantage of the size and decoying into decoys. One thing I just witnessed was that ducks especially pintails and larger ones were mallard mojo shy and seemed to be at ease with the teal mojo. I am trying to get a Gadwall mojo now to check its impact on gadwalls which are really abundant here. In the earlier season in Oct migration, mallard mojo was found to be very very effective, maybe becoz now the ducks have seen them everywhere but are still lesser familiar with teal mojos which fewer people buy in comparison to mallard ones.\r\n\r\nAs far as pintail drakes are concerned, I did manage to bag quite a few (gd sized ones with full bloom) in the two shoots immed post rains. I think we were plain lucky to hit a good area at the right time. Really enjoyed the early morning 1.5-hour non-stop flights.', ''),

(341349, ' ah thats right... lets not make a big deal out of nothing. my only point was that what i quoted was not to offend anyone it was a cultural quote and i explained it with a ''non redneck'' attitude or verbal attire. however, if u feel its equating the calibre a little too much with ''meaningless things'' then lets refrain from doing so. there are a very few who understand cultural and literary references in link to attitude-engineering. so i''ll restrict myself to talking about guns only :)\n\nbeen wanting to post here for quite some while after reading these two last posts... but couldnt find time. even signed in a couple of times to post a reply but just couldnt. hopefully ill find some time after my play is staged and then would be active on forums again. thankyou for your post brothers drag80 and starfish. :)\n\nso on the ''meaningful'' level: the general rule hailed by most professionals for self defense carry (sdcc) caliber is: "carry the most powerful weapon you can control in accurate rapid fire on multiple moving targets". for reference you can search for Chris Costa and Travis Haley of Magpul Dynamics (Travis has left MPD and has formed his own company now named Haley Strategic Partners), Massad Ayoob who carries a .45 as his sidearm and recommends it as the ONLY caliber for carrying in winter and Rob Pincus. all these top professionals say the same thing. when you don''t have a choice to shift between multiple calibers, choose the most powerful one you can control well.\n\nsee you can''t quantify the stopping power. all those scientifically drawn conclusions work very well when the variables are placed in a lab-controlled environment. but in a real world so much depends on so many factors that you cannot control. nothing is everything and everything is something. no caliber is ultimate. so i''ll stick to the heaviest and biggest i could easily fire and am good with. thats my two cs on the subject.\n\non a side note, the 9mm jhp is a nice ammo and i have nothing against it. but i am not a very good shooter with it. thats a personal thing. in summer when targets have less layers of clothes, it can work well for self defense and definitely has an advantage cuz of its smaller size (ie more rounds in a mag). however, i have experienced that with 9mm if the placement is a little off, the threat continues to be a threat and requires multiple shots to be stopped. \n\nguess what? im back lol :)', ''),

(341374, ' Thanks a lot all of you.....\n\n   Being a powerful human instinct, hunting is as old and authentic as human history. Using coal and colored mud the cave man of prehistoric era painted numerous hunting campaigns. Early man has learned to hunt down gigantic animals [like woolly mammoth = old BIG elephants] with spears.  Then killing a bear with a specialized spear seems logical. Guns and ballistics are obviously a new story. But a strong shaft with a specialized spear really carries enough mechanical energy to pierce a bear heart. The most important a strong hunting brain.... the keen and minute with strong nerves and arm thrust.\n\nA Muslim ruler was named SHAR after killing a lion [or tiger or whatever] with sword or spear. I am pointing Shar Shah Soori [actual name Farid Khan]. So it’s always a man behind the Spear..... :-)\n\n Personally i love n regard this spirit of hunting, i mean the hunting at arms length. At close quarters you can really feel more about GOD..... hahaha...\n\nA well known American weapon specialist says: Hunting with handgun [Revolver/pistol] is hunting at its peak\n\n           A Little Hunters thinks “What about hunting with sword or spear "\n\nHappy Hunting  ...........', ''),

(341454, ' [B]22-250 Remington[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 22-250 Remington was adopted early in 1965 as one of the calibers for the Remington 700 series bolt-action rifles, and also for the Model 40XB match rifle. Browning bolt-action rifles were offered in 22-250 caliber 2 years earlier. This is not a factory design, but rather a popular wildcat that has been around for many years. However, Remington''s espousal of the round moved it into the commercial classification.\r\nThere is some confusion regarding date of origin of the 22-250, which is based on the 250-3000 Savage case necked to 22-caliber. The parent cartridge was introduced in 1951 and a 22 version may have been made up experimentlly shortly thereafter. Harvey Donaldson, Grosvenor Wotkyns, J. E. Gebby, J. B. Smith and John Sweany all worked on versions of the 22-250 between about 1934 and 1937. J. B. Gebby  and J. B. Smith are  usually credited with having developed the present standardized configuration in 1937. However, there are different versions of this cartridge and  much depends on which one is reffered to. The Gebby version was named the 22 "Varminter" and he obtained a copyright on the name. Other gunsmiths renamed it the 22-250. The Wotkyns version was the forerunner of the 220 Swift, although Winchester ended up using the 6mm Lee Navy case rather than the 250 Savage.\r\nAt the present time, all of the major American, British and European rifle makers furnish bolt-action rifles in 22-250 chambering. In addition, the Ruger, Thompson/Center, and other single shots are available in this caliber.\r\nThe 22-250 is one of the best balanced and most flexible of the high-powered 22 centerfires. It is also the most popular of the long-range 22 varmint cartridges and will probably be around for many more years, something that cannot be said with any confidence about one or two of the others. The 22-250 also has a reputation for outstanding accuracy and has been used with some success for benchrest shooting. Many individuals who have had experience with both 22-250 and the 220 Swift report that the former gives significantly longer case life with full loads than the latter. The 22-250, as with some of the othe rhigh-powered 22s, has been used successfully on deer and antelope when loaded with heavy-jacketed bullets designed to hold together and provide deep penetration. The effecticveness of these cartridges on deer-sized animals depends on bullet construction, and none of the factory loaded or other varmint-type loads should ever be used on big game. The reason, of course, is that the light varmint bullets are made to expand quickly and will usually inflict a severe surface wound on a large animal.', ''),

Should answer all your dis assembly questions:\n\n[QUOTE=Abbas;32502]When purchasing the gun, the seller warned me never  to open/disassemble it as it can be a nightmare to put back. After my  200 round range session yesterday the weapon needed a through cleaning  and I would not have been satisfied without a complete disassembled  cleaning. \n\nHere''s what it look like taken apart. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/RugerDisassembled.jpg[/img]\n\nand after reassembly.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/RugerAssembled.jpg[/img]\n\n\nThe  whole process took me about 4 hours and at times was quite frustrating  as there are small parts which need to be aligned or you could face a  number of problems like the main recoil spring bolt not coming out or  going back in, the bolt getting stuck half cocked, barrel stuck to the  receiver, magazine issues, recoil spring alignment etc. Anyway it was an  experience as I''ve never come across such a complicated gun dis  assembly/assembly.  In theory it''s not that difficult but in reality and  for the first time does get a few curse words out of you that you  didn''t realize you knew ;)\n\nTo help future owners of the Mark III,  I''m adding a few links that will prove invaluable should you decided to  do a disassemble clean. I personally don''t think it''s required more  than once every 2000 rounds. \n\n\n[url]http://guntalk-online.com/fsprocedures.htm[/url]\n[url]http://www.guntalk-online.com/detailstrip.htm[/url]\n[url]http://guntalk-online.com/TroubleshootingPage.htm[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYHJm2P4kP0[/url][/QUOTE]', ''),

(341608, 'Budget Shotgun for HD Hello all, \n\nFirst of all I just wanted to thank everyone for the invaluable information available on this forum. Even though I just joined, I have already been going through some of the threads extensively and alot of my questions have already been answered. However, I have some questions left that I feel that I can now ask in a slightly educated manner. I''ve noticed that  there are alot of threads with extensive discussion on hunting shotguns but not as much on HD shotguns. What I''m looking for is:\n\n1. 12 gauge shotgun;\n2. Pump Action (only because I''ve read in other threads they are generally more reliable than semi-autos);\n3. A light and short shotgun (maybe something with a folding stock or a small fixed stock);\n4. Capacity of at least 7+1.\n\nMy basic requirement is for HD, and I don''t plan to use the shotgun for anything else. So I need something that will last a while with little or no maintenance requirement but will shoot without issues when (and if) I ever pull the trigger. I don''t want to buy something to expensive. I''m looking for something that is a reliable budget shotgun within 40-50K or less. Expert advice is solicited from the members of this forum.\n\nLast couple of questions, though I realize this is getting kind of long but I want to put down everything once instead of coming back with questions over and over again:\n\n1. Can someone also suggest a reliable dealer so I can avoid the risk of being sold a copy / clone.  \n\n2. Do I need a special license for a shotgun or will a provincial NPB license do? What is the approximate cost of a provincial license these days? (I''m considering getting a fresh license for this one).\n\n3. Do dealers have a place where I can test-fire the gun? That is the only place I ever hope to have to fire this. I don''t want to keep a completely untested shotgun for HD. If not, then where can I legally test my gun? (I vehemently oppose aerial firing) \n\nI''m sorry if this got very long, just looking for some solid advice. I would really appreciate if members could suggest specific models and makes instead of general advice like turkish or chinese. Thank you in advance!', ''),

This will prevent any pollen passing through the points where your glasses are loosely touching your skin.  I tried this method & it really worked well. \r\nThe second device to be used is an ordinary disposable clinical face mask which costs Rs5/- This is also very effective. \r\nIf prevention is taken, there is no need of taking medicines before or afterwards since allergy''s symptoms & affects varies from person to person and many people can''t be even cured by medicines.  \r\nSo we should not deny the wisdom of the famous saying, ...

It kind of gives a better feel of "lock", and I am sure it also is.\n\nThe employed method here seems a bit too "direct" to me, especially when bearing in mind that a metallic pin (latch) will keep going through a polymer frame, so I''d certainly have preferred to have traditional CZ field strip method and lock up.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

I was used to CZ Rami''s very tight latch and Sarsilmaz Kilinc 2000''s as well.\n\nI''d therefore at least have preferred a "displaced" removal of the latch, rather than direct, with no efforts involved, and even if the fitting of the latch is tight in the beginning, steel piercing a polymer hole can/may loosen up the framed hole over time.\n\nKindly consider all above my personal reflections only, let''s see what an expert shooter has to say on it''s accuracy, reliability, so I''m also awaiting Boss''s in-depth review from some more firing with it.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

In pure/classic CZ75, its 2-job and in other designs latch may be 1-job. :) hope you get the design point of view.\n \nNow latch going accross the frame issue. This latch/slide stop pin moves all through the locking block and locks inside (sticks inside) due to a frame pin(spring type) which fits in a crevice on slide stop pin. Point to be noted is; the stress and the beating this slide stop pin is taking is being dispensed into the steel locking block, frame polymer or steel or any other alloy has only the entry and exit holes on both side for the pin to ride across. These frame holes as such do not take the stress.', ''),

(341670, ' [B]Slide stop pin requiring to align the slide notch with frame notch:[/B]\nIt again depends upon the design. If the barrel lug is classic CZ75 i.e. bean shaped, one flatter smaller hole joined with 1 larger oblonged hole. \n \nThe small hole provides the resting for the slide stop notch while the gun is in battery.\nThe larger oblonged hole provides caming(tilting) of the barrel.\n \nIf you check closely, the barrel lug holes are fused together to form 1 large kidney type hole, notch moves accross these to provide rearward barrel movement for a short while WITH the slide also moving backwards as a barrel slide combo, at this time notch reaches the larger hole and there starts caming operation (tilting of barrel starts) and the barrel ribs(found on top of chamber) unlock from slide. Locking the breech is done on both levels from upper part of the barrel and from lower part of the barrel to provide firm and efficient lock up.\n \nThis was again the design point of view, this would help us to understand that.. To remove the pin you have to [B]align the slide notch with frame notch [/B]so as to let the pin shift to larger hole from the flatter smaller whole which is capturing the pin while gun is in battery.\n \nAny design which is not incorporating the BEAN shaped barrel lug of classic CZ75 will not require to align notches and hence the P-07 Duty. This is the answer to your comment.\n \nHowever, you can apply a hammer, to strike the pin out from its smaller flatter hole too, and pull the pin out without aligning the slide/frame notches. But this would require force and would damage your slide stop pin head, the spring type clamp and also the frame of the gun. :)', ''),

(341684, ' [B]45 Smith & Wesson[/B]\r\n\r\nAn obsolete blackpowder cartridge introduced in 1875 for the Smith & Wesson Schofield revolver. This revolver was adopted by the U.S. Army in that year and used until 1892 when it, and the 45 Colt Army revolver, were replaced by the Colt Army & Navy Model in 38-caliber. Commercial ammunition of this caliber was loaded until 1940. It is believed by some authorities that General Custer used a Schofield revolver at the battle of the Little Big Horn\r\nThe S&W Schofield revolver was a single-action, hinged-frame type. It employed a special, heavy barrel latch designed by General Schofield, hence the name. The cylinder of this revolver was not long enough to accept the 45 Colt so a shorter version was designed. The 45 S&W cartridge was loaded by government arsenals and used in both the Schofield model and the Colt Army to simplify supply. The 45 S&W can be used in any 45 Colt revolver, but the reverse is not true. Although the Colt single-action Army revolver is the one always depicted as the universal sidearm of the old West, nonetheless the S&W was quite popular. Although ammunition is no longer loaded and generally unavailable, one can make ammunition by shortening 45 Colt brass. These old guns were made for blackpowder so heavy smokeless charges should not be used.', ''),

(341725, 'Build Your Own Pistol Target Stand [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nI had too much time on my hands today thanks to a public holiday and absolute lack of interest in cricket. So instead of wasting my time in unproductive activities, I decided to spend the time instead on designing a Pistol Target Stand. \r\n\r\nAs with most projects, I decided upon following constraints for myself before I having a go at it:\r\n\r\n1. The target stand has to be convenient: carrying and setting up of the stand should be nothing more than a breeze.\r\n\r\n2. The target stand has to be self sufficient: no tools should be required in assembly and disassembly of the target stand.\r\n\r\n3. Minimize the probability of ricochet: the target stand should have the least amount of metal components as possible to minimize the chances of a ricochet.\r\n\r\n4. The target presentation should be atleast 66 inches high: taking the average height of a Pakistani male at 5 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\n6. Cost should be kept to bare minimum: I figured PKR 1000 is a good round figure for a descent pistol target stand therefore all efforts were made to ensure that it doesn’t go over set threshold.\r\n\r\n7. Weight should be kept to minimum: all efforts were directed in keeping the weight in check in a bid to increase the ease of carrying.\r\n\r\n8. The pistol target stand should durable enough to be used over and over again.\r\n\r\nI think i''m missing something here, wait!

I purchased a Beretta 87 Target last week, finally received today and previewing here now. It is elegent, slim and light. First thing I noticed is that the 6” long barrel is covered by a lightweight alloy sleeve that accepts optical sighting systems/weaver interface and so no grasping serations up front as we are used to on regular pistols. It can be cocked from over the slide as well as under the frame with supporting hand but near to impossible from rear. There seems no play between barrel and slide due to presence of gripping rail, adds to accuracy. Trigger reach is easy due to slim/small frame. Moment of slide when cocking is also very smooth. It is single action, trigger is very light, smooth and crisp and Beretta says in manual. It has a flat profile and squared off muzzle to allow steady ready position on bench etc to be quickly gripped. It has removable light alloy counter-weight with mounting rails so it is muzzle heavy. I liked the feel and finishing of pistol but due to slim profile and small frame base and grip it might take time to get comfortable due to my large hands.\r\n\r\nSpecifications: \r\n\r\n•Beretta 87 Target Pistol \r\n•Caliber: .22 Long Rifle \r\n•Features: \r\n     &#9702;Barrel Sleeve Has Integral Scope Base \r\n     &#9702;Light And Crisp Trigger Pull \r\n•Safeties: \r\n     &#9702;Ambidextrous Manual Thumb Safety \r\n     &#9702;Half-Cock \r\n•Operation: Semi-Automatic, Blow-Back \r\n•Hammer: Exposed, Single Action \r\n•Over-All Length: 8.9 Inches \r\n•Height: 5.4 Inches \r\n•Unloaded Weight: Approximately 29.4 Ounces \r\n•Barrel Length: 5.9 Inches \r\n•Rifling: Right Hand, 6 Grooves \r\n•Rifling Pitch: 13.8 Inches \r\n•Front Sight: Blade, Interchangeable \r\n•Rear Sight: V Notch, Adjustable For Elevation And Windage \r\n•Sight Radius: 7.28 Inches \r\n•Magazine: Straight Line \r\n•Round Capacity: 10 \r\n•Frame Material: Sand Blasted, Anodized Light Zirconium-Aluminum Alloy \r\n•Slide Material: Blued Steel \r\n•Barrel Material: Blued Steel \r\n•Barrel Sleeve Material: Sand Blasted Anodized Aluminum \r\n•Finish: Matte-Black\r\n\r\nNote: I am unable to attach all photos???', 'Review: Beretta Model 87 Target'),

The 1933 Winchester catalog says it is for "Webley and Bull Dog double action revolvers". It is obsolete.\r\nThe 45 Webley is similar to the 450 revolver cartridge, but has a slightly longer case. The two will interchange in most revolvers. Originally a blackpowder cartridge, the 45 Webley was loaded with 20 grains of powder and a 230-grain bullet. Smokeless powder was also used in late loadings. In power it is in the same class as the 41 Short Colt, but probably has superior stopping power because of the larger heavier bullet.

The 220 Weatherby Rocket was actually an improved wildcat based on the 220 Swift case, and Weatherby never manufactured ammunition of this caliber. The 224 Weatherby Magnum was introduced in 1963, but according to the late Roy Weatherby, the development work went back 10 years or so prior to this. Introduction of the cartridge was delayed due to lack of an entirely suitable action. The caliber is available in a reduced-size version of the Weatherby Mark V rifle and at present no one else chambers it.\r\nThe 224 Weatherby lies ballitically between 222 Remington and the 220 Swift. It is a belted case with the advantages inherit in this type of construction. For the handloader, it eliminates certain headspace and case-stretch problems and should provide maximum case life. It is an excellent long-range varmint cartridge with performance very similar to the 22-250 Remington. Its popularity has been determined largely by economic factors. One can buy a Remington, Ruger or Winchester bolt action in 22-250- caliber for about half the price of a Weatherby. The 224 Weatherby is, neverthless, a very fine choice to those who don''t mind the extra cost.', ''),

Based on his previous M1890 design, this rifle was manufactured in Austro-Hungarian Empire at state arms factories in Steyr (Austria) and Budapest (Hungary). More than 3 millions of M95 rifles were produced between 1895 and 1918. This rifle was issued to Austro-Hungarian army, and, after the fall of the Empire, to the Austrian and Hungarian armies. Originally produced in 8x50R caliber, in 1924 some of M95 rifles were converted to the German 7.92x57 Mauser (also known as 8x57 Mauser) ammunition. These converted rifles featured shorter 58 cm barrels, were designated as M95/24 and used in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. This conversion gave away with original Mannlicher en bloc clip, and replaced it with Mauser stripper clips. Since 1930 Austria converted most of the M95 rifles to the more powerful 8x56R M30 ammunition, using the same Mannlicher en bloc clips. These rifles were designated as M95/30, and marked with the letter "S" on the receiver ring. Hungary started to convert their rifles to the same 8x56R ammunition in 1931, with the upgraded rifles being marked with the letter "H" on the receiver ring. Many of the M95 rifles were used during the Word War 2 by the Hungarian, Bulgarian and Italian armies, as well as by some German police forces.\r\nFerdinand Von Mannlicher developed his first straight-pull bolt action rifle by 1884, and by 1885 he developed the famous Mannlicher en block clip, which was inserted into the box magazine from the top, and automatically ejected through the opening at the bottom of the magazine as the last round was chambered. This significantly speed up the loading process, compared to the earlier designs with magazines loaded by single rounds; the problem was that such magazine could not be loaded with loose rounds without the clip. As a result, during the early part of the 20 century Mannlicher en bloc clip was generally replaced by the Mauser-type stripper clip. Earliest Mannlicher straight-pull rifles have had not so strong wedge-locking system, but in 1890 he introduced a straight pull bolt action with rotary bolt head with two lugs, which he latter used in M95 rifles.\r\nSteyr Mannlicher M95 bolt has a separate head with two frontal locking lugs; bolt head was inserted into the bolt body from the front. Bolt body had internal spiral-shaped ribs, with matching spiral-shaped cuts in the tail of the bolt head. These ribs and cuts forced the bolt head to rotate on the pull of the bolt body, locking and unlocking the action. Box magazine contained five rounds in en bloc clips; as the magazine emptied, the clips were ejected from the opening at the bottom of the magazine. Non-empty clips could be removed from the top with the bolt open, by depressing the clip catch inside the triggerguard. One specific feature of this system was that the clip has specific "top" and "bottom" sides, and could not be loaded into the rifle upside down. The safety was located at the rear left side of the bolt. Large ear-shaped cocking handle at the rear of the bolt served as a manual cocking handle, to re-cock the action without operating the bolt. M95 rifles were issued with detachable knife bayonets. Other than basic rifle, M95 also was issued as Stutzen (short rifle or carbine, with bayonet lug), and slightly shorter cavalry carbine (without bayonet lug).\r\nThese rifles are generally considered as a reasonably strong and accurate, but somewhat sensitive to mud and dirt, as most others military straight pull bolt action rifles. There were several downsides, inherent to these rifles. The straight pull bolt lacked the powerful initial extraction, provided by most rotating bolt actions. Large opening at the bottom of the magazine easily collected the dirt and dust into the magazine. The en block clip loading system does not allow the partially full magazine to be refilled without removing the non-empty clip first. The use of rimmed ammunition resulted in the non-symmetric clip which could be inserted into the action only with one side down; upper side of the clip has stamped serrations to hold it while loading (this particular problem was cured in Italian Carcano rifles, which used rimless ammunition, and symmetric clips).\r\n\r\n[/B]\r\n\r\nMoreover, visited a site named GUNBOARD.COM, gone through the threads of the site and I found a similar querry you made and  I found that these rifles are  also chambered in 6.5X55 Rimmed.\r\nAs u mentioned the [B]J Jaffery King st ,St James London.[/B] markings of ur rifle and I tried to search the net with the reference of these markings on various search engines and got a retailer''s address resembling to the marking of ur rifle,  which im also mentioning below.\r\n\r\n[B]Moore & Woodward. 64 St James St, London. 1843-1972[/B].\r\nThe address is from the website named ([url]www.firearmsmuseum.org.au[/url]).\r\n\r\nIts seems that some gunsmith named "Jeffery" from the above mentioned London address had done some refurbishment work or may be customized the famous Steyr M1985 rifle for its previous owner which has reached you.\r\nThats all I got after this 9 hours toil n moil in which I left no stone unturned.\r\nSorry once again for not fullfilling your querry completely and its making me really really sorrow that I havent served a senior forum member correctly.\r\nHope my unresposibility be neglected\r\nRegards.', ''),

There''s a story behind its buy, however, which I would like to share here with other members of PG. \r\n\r\nUnlike in many other countries, buying and carrying a firearm in PK is different. The difference can be traced on three major levels and I will briefly touch upon each of these:\r\n\r\n[B][U]1. The Legal Dimension:[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nEveryone knows about the rule of law in Pakistan. We lag behind all developed and most of the developing countries as well-educated law-abiding citizens. There are many factors contributing to the fact, but the bottom line is that owning a gun in PK is not thought of as a huge responsibility or an attitude-altering event.\r\n\r\nMost people who carry around here, to the best of my knowledge, are either hobbyists or people with enmity/vendetta. There are very few people (extremely few in fact) that I know of who belong to the middle-employed-class who carry a gun for self/home defense. \r\n\r\nGetting a licence through means of bribe, hush-money and ''sifarish'' is common. Most repercussions that play a huge role in affecting the CCW decision of an individual do not play an important role in PK. The legal system is corrupt and there are many loop holes awaiting to be exploited by individuals in power (with a ''back'' or money).\r\n\r\n[B][U]2. The Cultural Dimension[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nAdding to the above factors, the displaying of the owned firearms has become a huge cultural component in PK over the years. "Air Firing" is common on cultural events, most prominent of which are the "Shab-e-Bara''at" and Wedding Ceremonies. \r\n\r\nIt is common for people with enmity/vendetta to proudly display their guns in public and ''feel'' safe. To some extend, it has become a boost for their egos, and added edge to their psyches.\r\n\r\n[B][U]3. The Personal Dimension[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nLastly, a noticeable thing about the gun community of PK (that I am familiar with) is the lack of training. There are virtually no means for civilians to get firearm training in PK and almost all serious gun-owners in PK rely on skills learnt through random shooting at the ranges. \r\n\r\nMoreover, not all types and makes of firearms are available in Pakistan and that limits personal choices to a large extend. Related to the same is also the extraordinary price difference we see in some of the brands locally available through an importer. An apt example would be Glock which is a cheap gun in States. In fact Glock''s main attraction is in its low price and extreme reliability. Yet in PK it is one of the most expensive handguns you can come across. I was shocked to learn that it costs more than even Original 92FS, which is a much much more expensive gun.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when I decided on carrying a gun, it wasn''t easy for me to decide on the make or model. Before I get into details about how I finally arrived at the conclusion that I wanted a 1911 with accessory rails, let me just briefly address two other important issues:\r\n\r\n[B][U]A. The Local Gun Market at Lahore: My Impressions[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nMost of the people doing business in the local arms market know nothing or very little about technicalities involved in choosing a gun, and are, hence to my experience, a source you cannot rely on. For this matter, you have to search online, talk to people online and then when you go to a gun shop, you come to know that most of the things you planned on buying are not available. They would tell you to revisit soon, but I have since known better. \r\n\r\nSome of these merchants are friendly and very welcoming. However, most of them have an attitude and know absolutely nothing about politeness in customer dealing. That is a HUGE factor in restricting "learned and responsible" civilians'' interaction with the arms market IMO. \r\n\r\n[B][U]B. The Conceal and Carry Attitude[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nAnother important factor addresses responsibility. When you buy a firearm, you have to have to realize that it is a 24/7 responsibility that you cannot ever escape. A question a gun-owner needs to ask him/herself is that is he/she an asset to the society or a threat? It is not a source of power or is meant to save your ego but an emergency life-saving tool that you have to employ ONLY when your or one of your family member''s life is in danger. You have to heighten the awareness of your surroundings and train efficiently with a holster if you plan to carry. You have to learn the five laws of safety by heart and then keep practicing with them regularly to not to forget or take for granted any one of these.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to show your firearm off or fire in air on occasions but we should all keep in mind that that is illegal. It doesn''t matter if we can get away with it or not, something wrong stays wrong even if one can evade getting punished for it.\r\n\r\nWith these factors in mind, I had to make a conscious decide... I had to choose. And I chose to carry a firearm to defend myself having the knowledge of all of the above.\r\n\r\nNow the main question. Why did I choose a 1911 to carry for self defense. Let me address this question in detail.\r\n\r\n[B][U]1. An Ideal SD/HD/CCW Caliber?[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nThere is an endless debate over the preferred caliber which basically boils down to a robust and enthusiastic (and often pointless) 9mm vs .45 marathon. \r\n\r\nThere are endless renderings of empirical/scientific data available on the internet from both sides on these calibers and their effectiveness. However, one may agree that theoretical correctness does not ensure amicable results in the field. In a controlled environment where all variables are placed carefully and are monitored and controlled, you can experiment and experiment for a lifetime and find that none of the lab results correspond with 100% accuracy to shootings in the field. An apt example would be of the 1986 FBI Miami Shootout which lead to the development of the .40 S&W round, for the "...subsequent FBI investigation placed partial blame for the agents'' deaths on the lack of stopping power exhibited by their service handguns", which were chambered in 9mm or less.\r\n\r\nThe critical factors, one has to argue, are the penetration and tissue damage. The image below lists most commonly used calibers for self defense in JHP form:\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1564[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\nSince all of these reach the minimum required penetration limit of 12", it is not unsound to say that any of these calibers would offer apt defensive capabilities for a lay-user.\r\n\r\nThe chart below compares expansive capabilities of these rounds in JHP:\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1568[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\nIt could be seen clearly that .45 round expands the most. Also, in FMJ (or ball) form, .45 offers better penetration and a heavier permanent cavity in well-clothed subjects. However, a 9mm bullet also offers impressive expansion and penetrates well beyond the 12 inches limit. With its smaller size, it is a preferred caliber for many people. Having said that, in Pakistan, generally 25 bullets are allowed to be carried with a licence and a CC permit. Hence it is pointless to posses a gun that could feed 19 rounds of ammo in one clip (e.g. XDm 9mm), for the mere reason of its feeding capacity.\r\n\r\nAn extensive FBI study study on the subject concludes in the following:\r\n\r\n"Physiologically, no caliber or bullet is certain to incapacitate any individual unless the brain is hit. Psychologically, some individuals can be incapacitated by minor or small caliber wounds. Those individuals who are stimulated by fear, adrenaline, drugs, alcohol, and/or sheer will and survival determination may not be incapacitated even if mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nThe will to survive and to fight despite horrific damage to the body is commonplace on the battlefield, and on the street. Barring a hit to the brain, the only way to force incapacitation is to cause sufficient blood loss that the subject can no longer function, and that takes time. Even if the heart is instantly destroyed, there is sufficient oxygen in the brain to support full and complete voluntary action for 10-15 seconds.\r\n\r\nKinetic energy does not wound. Temporary cavity does not wound. The much discussed "shock" of bullet impact is a fable and "knock down" power is a myth. The critical element is PENETRATION. The bullet must pass through the large, blood bearing organs and be of sufficient diameter to promote rapid bleeding. Penetration less than 12 inches is too little and... "too little penetration will get killed". Given desirable and reliable penetration, the only way to increase bullet effectiveness is to increase the severity of the wound by increasing the size of hole made by the bullet. Any bullet which will not penetrate through vital organs from less than optimal angels is not acceptable. Of those that will penetrate, THE EDGE IS ALWAYS WITH THE BIGGER BULLET".\r\n\r\n(From Handgun Wounding Factors and Effectiveness by Urey W. Patrick, Firearms Training Unit, FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia)\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the handguns are inadequate in terms of real power to begin with. You use these primarily as a part of the defensive repertoire and not the primary weaponry system. It is important to realize their limitations. No matter which caliber they are, they are never going to be "sufficient" in terms of real power. So to decide which caliber I was gonna carry, I simply stuck to the old rule "carry the most powerful weapon you can shoot effectively". For me that was a .45. Another factor due to which I chose forty-five over nine mill was one of my personal experience where, even after multiple shots from my Walther-P99, the assailant kept coming. That was a huge factor for me in not relying on a nine mill again.\r\n\r\n[B][U]2. The Weapon System[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nAfter deciding that I needed a .45, the next step was to decide between the weapon systems available. In an ideal world where I had ALL brands available, my choices might have been wider. There is the excellent HK USP45 which I have had a pleasure of firing more that a couple of times. It is accurate, very reliable and extremely powerful weapon system that is light weight and is easy to conceal and carry with an IWB. Then there are the famous Glock 17 and 19 which I have shot as well and have found extremely accurate and durable. Another pistol that I like is S&W M&P45 which has excellent ergonomics. And last but not the least, I am a huge fan of 1911s which is the Porsche of all handguns... the ultimate assassin. I have shot many rounds with a Kimber and have always found it an absolute pleasure and honor.\r\n\r\nHowever, in PK, my choices were limited. First of all, belonging to middle-class employed class, I had a limited budget and had an option to own only one gun for both SD/HD and CCW. So my main choices were limited to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Walther P99\r\n2. CZ Rami\r\n3. Taurus PT-1911\r\n\r\nI quickly discarded Rami from my choice list because of its size and ergonomics. My hands never really fitted well on almost any subcompact guns and a subcompact gun is not suitable for HD. These two factors lead me to believe that Rami was not for me in the current situation.\r\n\r\nWalther P99 is a sweet piece. I have had lots of experience with this gun and if I had a choice of buying two firearms, I would definitely have bought a P99 as the second one. But since I had the choice of buying only one firearm (and probably for a long time too) I had to consider three major factors:\r\n\r\na) The Caliber\r\n\r\nIt was available only in 9mm at the local market, and I wanted a .45. I would''ve even settled on a .40 S&W but that wasn''t available.\r\n\r\nb) Ergonomics\r\n\r\nPlastic guns have never fitted my hands well. To shoot a handgun effectively, you need a high two-handed grip with raised thumbs. Acquiring this grip on a P99 (or even Glocks and HKs) even with the largest grip-adjustment back-strap, made my trigger finger barely reach the trigger (on HK USP, after taking out the slack from the trigger, however, it was an alright reach) which meant that I wasn''t touching and pressing the trigger which is absolutely essential for rapid firing drills but was yanking on the trigger causing the gun to shift laterally and affecting the sight picture after every placed shot. It also made my hands fatigued quickly. That was a huge negative factor for me.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side though, P99 is probably one of the best pistols that I shoot extremely well with my right hand only. Also, it is light weight and that plays a pivotal role in considering a gun for ConcealedCarry.\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1567[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I decided to go with the weight and finally made up my mind to buy a 1911 weapon system. The only 1911 available in PK brand new and untouched was PT-1911 so that is exactly what I bought... with rails.\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1569[/ATTACH]\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1565[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of high res pics available online for PT-1911 AR SS and so I won''t post much of the pics here. Maybe in another post. So let us see what this gun offers for HD and especially CC.\r\n\r\n[B][U]1. The System[/U][/B]\r\n\r\n1911s have been around for a century now... and there is an old saying: "If it aint broke, don''t fix it". This weapon system has proven the test of time and has established itself as a fast, efficient, accurate and extremely reliable system. For me, the 1911s have soul and their mechanical parts and the need to care for them more than the plastic guns establishes a relationship with the gun. They require more care and maintenance than the Glocks for example. But that, for me is a good way to really ''own'' a gun.\r\n\r\nThey are external hammer fired weapon systems and viz-a-viz the internal striker fired systems are better prone to malfunction if the dust or mud gathers around the hammer or gets into the opening of the firing pin housing. However, I have never experienced that with a Kimber and I used to fire it in rainy season all the time. It did require extensive cleaning after returning home but never gave away while shooting. I have not had a chance to handle my PT1911 in such a situation so I am unable to provide with statistics in that regard.\r\n\r\nPT 1911 is an excellent weapon system. It has everything (well almost... for I would have preferred tritium night sights) that a custom/semi-custom 1911 should have. The SS version is forged steel, offering extreme reliability with added weight for better recoil. Nice long beaver-tail grip-system, slim well-fitted grips, lowered and flared ejection port with an elongated ejector, and a skeleton trigger house the PT-1911 with everything a 1911 needs. It is fairly accurate and while shooting 50 FMJ 230 grainers, it didn''t even blink once.\r\n\r\n[B][U]2. The Weight and Length[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nA full-sized 1911 has a barrel length of 5" which maybe a bit difficult to conceal. PT-1911 weighs a full 32 oz without bullets and that is a lot especially if you are not of a large built. Carrying this 1911 is difficult and I wont deny the fact that the weight becomes a pain in the neck especially in summer. However, if you get used to it and employ an efficient way of CC (for example Uncle Mike''s shoulder horizontal holster or Kangaroo Carry), then you can get used to it pretty quick.\r\n\r\n[B][U]3. Recoil[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nI have absolutely no issue with its recoil. I have installed Hogue Tactical grips on it which aids me in gripping the gun in a better way and reduces recoil even further.\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1563[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[B][U]4. Accessory Rail[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nI opted for the AR version ''cuz I plan on installing the tactical light w/ laser dot. The Accessory Rail is an essential addition to the 1911 design to utilize the modern technologies, and I can''t imagine keeping a handgun at home without an attached tactical light system.\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1561[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\nI believe I have posted a thorough review of my buy. I might have wanted to add something to the above-said, but am too tired right now to remember exactly :)\r\n\r\nSo this is my take on the PT-1911 as a CCW/HD in PK. \r\n\r\nEnded.', 'Taurus PT-1911 as CCW/HD in PK'),

No matter which caliber they are, they are never going to be "sufficient" in terms of real power. So to decide which caliber I was gonna carry, I simply stuck to the old rule "carry the most powerful weapon you can shoot effectively". For me that was a .45. Another factor due to which I chose forty-five over nine mill was one of my personal experience where, even after multiple shots from my Walther-P99, the assailant kept coming. That was a huge factor for me in not relying on a nine mill again.\n\n[B][U]2. The Weapon System[/U][/B]\n\nAfter deciding that I needed a .45, the next step was to decide between the weapon systems available. In an ideal world where I had ALL brands available, my choices might have been wider. There is the excellent HK USP45 which I have had a pleasure of firing more that a couple of times. It is accurate, very reliable and extremely powerful weapon system that is light weight and is easy to conceal and carry with an IWB. Then there are the famous Glock 17 and 19 which I have shot as well and have found extremely accurate and durable. Another pistol that I like is S&W M&P45 which has excellent ergonomics. And last but not the least, I am a huge fan of 1911s which is the Porsche of all handguns... the ultimate assassin. I have shot many rounds with a Kimber and have always found it an absolute pleasure and honor.\n\nHowever, in PK, my choices were limited. First of all, belonging to middle-class employed class, I had a limited budget and had an option to own only one gun for both SD/HD and CCW. So my main choices were limited to the following:\n\n1. Walther P99\n2. CZ Rami\n3. Taurus PT-1911\n\nI quickly discarded Rami from my choice list because of its size and ergonomics. My hands never really fitted well on almost any subcompact guns and a subcompact gun is not suitable for HD. These two factors lead me to believe that Rami was not for me in the current situation.\n\nWalther P99 is a sweet piece. I have had lots of experience with this gun and if I had a choice of buying two firearms, I would definitely have bought a P99 as the second one. But since I had the choice of buying only one firearm (and probably for a long time too) I had to consider three major factors:\n\na) The Caliber\n\nIt was available only in 9mm at the local market, and I wanted a .45. I would''ve even settled on a .40 S&W but that wasn''t available.\n\nb) Ergonomics\n\nPlastic guns have never fitted my hands well. To shoot a handgun effectively, you need a high two-handed grip with raised thumbs. Acquiring this grip on a P99 (or even Glocks and HKs) even with the largest grip-adjustment back-strap, made my trigger finger barely reach the trigger (on HK USP, after taking out the slack from the trigger, however, it was an alright reach) which meant that I wasn''t touching and pressing the trigger which is absolutely essential for rapid firing drills but was yanking on the trigger causing the gun to shift laterally and affecting the sight picture after every placed shot. It also made my hands fatigued quickly. That was a huge negative factor for me.\n\nOn the plus side though, P99 is probably one of the best pistols that I shoot extremely well with my right hand only. Also, it is light weight and that plays a pivotal role in considering a gun for ConcealedCarry.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1572[/ATTACH]\n\nNevertheless, I decided to go with the weight and finally made up my mind to buy a 1911 weapon system. The only 1911 available in PK brand new and untouched was PT-1911 so that is exactly what I bought... with rails.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1570[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1573[/ATTACH]\n\nThere are a lot of high res pics available online for PT-1911 AR SS and so I won''t post much of the pics here. Maybe in another post. So let us see what this gun offers for HD and especially CC.\n\n[B][U]1. The System[/U][/B]\n\n1911s have been around for a century now... and there is an old saying: "If it aint broke, don''t fix it". This weapon system has proven the test of time and has established itself as a fast, efficient, accurate and extremely reliable system. For me, the 1911s have soul and their mechanical parts and the need to care for them more than the plastic guns establishes a relationship with the gun. They require more care and maintenance than the Glocks for example. But that, for me is a good way to really ''own'' a gun.\n\nThey are external hammer fired weapon systems and viz-a-viz the internal striker fired systems are better prone to malfunction if the dust or mud gathers around the hammer or gets into the opening of the firing pin housing. However, I have never experienced that with a Kimber and I used to fire it in rainy season all the time. It did require extensive cleaning after returning home but never gave away while shooting. I have not had a chance to handle my PT1911 in such a situation so I am unable to provide with statistics in that regard.\n\nPT 1911 is an excellent weapon system. It has everything (well almost... for I would have preferred tritium night sights) that a custom/semi-custom 1911 should have. The SS version is forged steel, offering extreme reliability with added weight for better recoil. Nice long beaver-tail grip-system, slim well-fitted grips, lowered and flared ejection port with an elongated ejector, and a skeleton trigger house the PT-1911 with everything a 1911 needs. It is fairly accurate and while shooting 50 FMJ 230 grainers, it didn''t even blink once.\n\n[B][U]2. The Weight and Length[/U][/B]\n\nA full-sized 1911 has a barrel length of 5" which maybe a bit difficult to conceal. PT-1911 weighs a full 32 oz without bullets and that is a lot especially if you are not of a large built. Carrying this 1911 is difficult and I wont deny the fact that the weight becomes a pain in the neck especially in summer. However, if you get used to it and employ an efficient way of CC (for example Uncle Mike''s shoulder horizontal holster or Kangaroo Carry), then you can get used to it pretty quick.\n\n[B][U]3. Recoil[/U][/B]\n\nI have absolutely no issue with its recoil. I have installed Hogue Tactical grips on it which aids me in gripping the gun in a better way and reduces recoil even further.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1575[/ATTACH]\n\n[B][U]4. Accessory Rail[/U][/B]\n\nI opted for the AR version ''cuz I plan on installing the tactical light w/ laser dot. The Accessory Rail is an essential addition to the 1911 design to utilize the modern technologies, and I can''t imagine keeping a handgun at home without an attached tactical light system.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1576[/ATTACH]\n\nI believe I have posted a thorough review of my buy. I might have wanted to add something to the above-said, but am too tired right now to remember exactly :)\n\nSo this is my take on the PT-1911 as a CCW/HD in PK. \n\nEnded.', 'Taurus PT-1911 as CCW/HD in PK'),

(341926, 'Review: Beretta Model 87 Target Salam All,\r\n\r\nToday is one of my lucky days. I purchased a Beretta 87 Target last week, finally received today and previewing here now. It is elegent, slim and light. First thing I noticed is that the 6” long barrel is covered by a lightweight alloy sleeve that accepts optical sighting systems/weaver interface and so no grasping serations up front as we are used to on regular pistols. It can be cocked from over the slide as well as under the frame with supporting hand but near to impossible from rear. There seems no play between barrel and slide due to presence of gripping rail, adds to accuracy. Trigger reach is easy due to slim/small frame. Moment of slide when cocking is also very smooth. It is single action, trigger is very light, smooth and crisp and Beretta says in manual. It has a flat profile and squared off muzzle to allow steady ready position on bench etc to be quickly gripped. It has removable light alloy counter-weight with mounting rails so it is muzzle heavy. I liked the feel and finishing of pistol but due to slim profile and small frame base and grip it might take time to get comfortable due to my large hands.\r\n\r\nSpecifications: \r\n\r\n•Beretta 87 Target Pistol \r\n•Caliber: .22 Long Rifle \r\n•Features: \r\n     &#9702;Barrel Sleeve Has Integral Scope Base \r\n     &#9702;Light And Crisp Trigger Pull \r\n•Safeties: \r\n     &#9702;Ambidextrous Manual Thumb Safety \r\n     &#9702;Half-Cock \r\n•Operation: Semi-Automatic, Blow-Back \r\n•Hammer: Exposed, Single Action \r\n•Over-All Length: 8.9 Inches \r\n•Height: 5.4 Inches \r\n•Unloaded Weight: Approximately 29.4 Ounces \r\n•Barrel Length: 5.9 Inches \r\n•Rifling: Right Hand, 6 Grooves \r\n•Rifling Pitch: 13.8 Inches \r\n•Front Sight: Blade, Interchangeable \r\n•Rear Sight: V Notch, Adjustable For Elevation And Windage \r\n•Sight Radius: 7.28 Inches \r\n•Magazine: Straight Line \r\n•Round Capacity: 10 \r\n•Frame Material: Sand Blasted, Anodized Light Zirconium-Aluminum Alloy \r\n•Slide Material: Blued Steel \r\n•Barrel Material: Blued Steel \r\n•Barrel Sleeve Material: Sand Blasted Anodized Aluminum \r\n•Finish: Matte-Black\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1599[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1600[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1601[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1602[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1590[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1589[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1588[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1587[/IMG]', ''),

(341938, ' [QUOTE=AK47;178728][B]@Denovo87[/B].......+1! On the [I]reliability[/I] check with the more commonly available ammo.\n\nI agree Sir, but I''d suggest the [I]reliability[/I] part is checked during this test, [I]separately[/I], and not as part of the remaining test, which is more centered around the [I]out of the box[/I] use by a traditional buyer, yet with the rightly chosen ammo. Hence, from the aspect, that the buyer at least will be careful in selecting his SD ammo. I doubt the majority of SD users would use local reloads, especially with imported guns. And by the way, the MP 446 would stand out a clear winner in this regard, I suppose. \n\nAgreed, we can do the reliability test with troublesome loads, like POF 1Z/2Z on the spot as well, yet as a [I]separate feature[/I]. If agreed, we can incorporate the score of this feature in the overall aggregate of the test for each gun, yet, I''d humbly request it as a[I] separate measure[/I], [B]since we should assume that the buyer will be selective with ammo[/B] [B]for SD use[/B], and ensure he''s getting the right thing, only from the right dealers. We''ll leave this occasional and bad luck variable upon the customer himself.\n\n[I]The thing to discuss here is actually the [B]mode [/B]of conducting the test[/I]. I am open for suggestions. My personal suggestion is as follows:\n\n[B]Part 1[/B]:\n\nEach of the guns should be fired at a constant SD range, say 10 mtrs, 5 shots in each string, each string by 1 of 3 different class of shooters, skilled, intermediate, amateur, and then calculate the gross average score for each gun. The shooting should be IPSC style, hence pick from the table and blast out, or out of the holster and blast out, kind of quick firing, since majority of members have SD purposes behind the purchases, and we should try to resemble that kind of shooting. This means 15 shots with each gun, for this part of the test, hence some 75 to 90 rounds total requirement (5-6 handguns)\n\n[B]Part 2[/B]:\n\nThe second part should be pure [I]accuracy testing[/I], hence say from 15 meters distance, 5-7 shots by each gun, by only [B]1[/B] top skilled shooter, double handed, deliberate fires.\n\nThis would require [B]30[/B] rounds only in total, from 6 handguns,[B] if using 5 rounds in each string[/B] with each gun. If using 7, it means 42 rounds, still with 6 guns in mind. I somehow just feel that 7 shots would say more than 5, coz at times the 1.st shot usually lands at a strange point, bearing in mind that the shooters do not have all these guns in their normal use, and may be new to some of them.\n\nThe distance of 15 meters has been suggested as to give the guns a bit of run for the money. Furthermore, which ever gun would shoot good from this distance, would definitely shoot good from the shorter and more traditional SD ranges, say 7 meters.\n\nSince with this suggestion, a bit different from my initial in which I suggested 3 shooters to do the accuracy testing, we only have [B]one[/B] top skilled shooter here, hence the ammo requirement also has been reduced by 10 shots with each gun, thus a reduction of some 50-60 rounds, making total requirement come down to close to 150 rounds, for the main test. \n\n[COLOR="red"]The overall aggregate score of the two parts above should be the declarable result[/COLOR]. \n\nFinally, as a topping of the cake, we''ll make the winning [I]budget gun[/I] compete with a [I]high-end gun[/I], say the Glock 19, again using same mode as above, hence requiring 15 shots with each gun in part 1, and 5-7 rounds each in part 2, thus around 40 rounds for the dual between the budget and the high-end class. \n\nThis brings ammo requirement to some 190 rounds (150+40) for the conclusion of the day.\n\nAt day''s end we''ll get to know which budget gun is the best for the budget class customer, and how much below it really is in performance vs the high-ender, at least within this purpose of use, durability, versatility, tennifer coatings, etc, all extra goodies disregarded.\n\nI believe it will serve greatly for the choices here, especially for new and confused members.\n\n I am also ready to add 1 more skilled shooter to the accuracy testing, since it would give an even better overall picture.\n\nLet me please know of further suggestions.\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nI am repeating my above post for a discussion on the mode of the test as laid out by me. I''d like senior members to come forth now and discuss the mode of conduct. Do you agree, or have other suggestions that we could add up?\n\nI am even thinking to ask for agreement on adding up another total of [B]30 round[/B] (5 rounds for each of 6 handguns) [I]for the top skilled shooter only[/I], to burst out in full speed, 15 mtrs?? We won''t be uniting every day, why not cover all aspects guys, let''s have some fun, what do you say?\n\nThe target stand has been laid forth brilliantly by 12G bro, and I''d suggest each participating, shooting member, to have one made for the event, inclusive of myself. Cost is barely Rs. 1000, and this wills serve you in future as well. Especially Den bro does need one, lolz! In any case, it would be nice to have some 4 of these, and 12G bro has 2. Mine will be the 3rd, so one more at least would be appreciated??\n\nI am going to schedule the whole event more comprehensively now, with a voting option here as well, but I need above quoted post replied first, so the outline is finalized.

(341961, ' [QUOTE=Denovo87;180748]First of all we have to outline the main objectives these guns will be battling for (if I am not sounding like "[B]SAREE RAAT RONDAY RAHAY TAY MARYA KOI WEE NA[/B]" ;) ) ...[/QUOTE]\n\nExactly! Heer/Ranja were [I]lovers[/I] bro! Lolz!\n\nObjectives:\n\n[B]1) SD Handling of the guns in skilled hands.[/B]\n\n[B]2) SD Handling of the guns in unskilled hands.[/B]\n\nWe want a base here on our forum that could assist new purchasers specifically, with the traditional confusions, with respect to which handgun is the best, in terms of out-of-the box -[I] shooting[/I] mainly, and performs best to people with no major shooting history, yet SD requirement.\n\nIn terms of reliability, all handguns selected, already do meet the criteria.\n\nIn terms of finishing, we also, already, do know of the pluses/minuses of each gun.\n\nIn terms of [I]endurance[/I], all selected handguns will last most of us, and rarely do people keep a single gun for life, I mean, of [I]enthusiast[/I]s.\n\nWe wanna see the [I]all rounder performance [/I]of each gun, in terms of deliberate fires, q[I]uicker SD situation fires[/I], [I]speed SD fires[/I], over[I] max [/I]and [I]min[/I] SD ranges, since HD/SD is the major concern of most new purchasers. We already do have Gilani Sb''s superb expert opinions and percentages enlisted of scores of each gun in deliberate fires. Real life SD situations do not allow you minutes of concentration before each shot. This is where these tests will differ from the already existing data of slow, deliberate, longer distance shooting. \n\nThe reason why I added the 20 mtrs deliberate fires here, was just plain [I]formality[/I], since we''d be gathered anyway, so why not include this part as well and support it up with Gilani Sb''s existing data?\n\nAll above is traditionally commented on here by experts only. An expert will shoot good enough with any handgun. 90% of our info-seekers here, with numerous threads and questions about which hand gun is good or better over the other, will have a thread for easy selection, at least from the [I]shooting performance[/I] perspective. Rest will be about different luxuries/essentials/extra features offered by each of the guns, and the cost differences.\n\n[COLOR="red"]Finally, on hand sizes variations, 12G bro''s size is already large enough, Moeens a good middle sized, so is Dr. Zakir Sb''s. I and Den, either any of us, or both, can take care of the smaller to mid sized hands variation, so each handgun will be passing through each hand size as well!![/COLOR] \n\nAll shooters will be requested to perform up to optimal performance with each handgun, and no bias is allowed here. We need neutral stance. 12G bro will be requested to fire the CZ-999 as intermediate shooter, since he has the most of experience with it and is an excellent CZ-999 shot, no doubts.\n\nWe can discuss who will shoot in which category here, all shooters of the 3 different classes, will be[I][B] pre-determined[/B][/I] here,[I] prior to the test[/I], and listed here. This, in order to ensure smooth flow and professional conduction, with clear objectives.\n\n[COLOR="blue"]I personally would suggest 5 shots each by Moeen bro and Dr. Zakir Sb, prior to actual battle, with choice 9mm SD handgun, and best shooter will be determined [I]Top Skilled[/I] for the remaining tests, the second best will be determined the [I]Intermediate[/I], if there''s any confusion on who is the better shooting of our 2 senior respectables here, they''re both excellent shots, no doubts.[/COLOR]\n\nThis will leave place for the [I]amateur[/I] only. I am willing to stand out, if any other and respectable member would like to perform.\n\nI hope I managed establishing the objectives clearly enough, and I am asking respectable seniors to add up, with anything that I may have missed. Any suggestions to make the event better, more joyous and beneficial is welcome. Let''s have some fun.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I''m 6''2" 246.4 lbs and I carry my 1911 in Uncle Mike''s shoulder horizontal holster in winter and a darra made custom belt holster in summer. Also, I would say that our traditional dress (shalwar qamees) aids a lot in doing so for me at least. If you practice well with it, you can conceal and carry it. However, and this is important, you should consider lighter and smaller guns for CC purposes if you are gonna CC a lot especially in summer. The weight of 1911 is simply too much for most of people. \n\nAnother CC option would be to carry it in a Kangaroo Carry holster. You can order one from their website I suppose. I had owned one previously and found it very useful. Don''t have it anymore though.\n\nOne last thing... in my experience, buying a second-hand gun is almost always a bad idea.

His reservation was basically that we''d be in a hurry, with so many guns around, and scarce time, to do the proper accuracy testing under ideal conditions. I agreed, but suggested that we then use Gilani Sb''s already existing data for all these handguns and use that for the aggregate total of the day, for each gun, combining those scores/percentages/ratings with the results from the pure SD firing of the day.

(342304, ' LOL... Pam vs Nicole... hahahahhahahahaha\n\nYeah brothers I get the ''DIY'' thingy. However, there are two points to be considered from my POV:\n\n1. The holsters that KangarooCarry makes can''t be made at home. The basic rig can be created but the holsters that can accompany that rig to sit your holster deep and concealed on your ribcage under your armpit is a job for a pro. \n2. I have found many belts w/ holsters that I can carry my gun in, however, none of these can fit my rib cage. My ribcage is around 54" (expanded) and none of the locally available belts come even closer to fitting on my ribcage. Guess I''ll have to get one made from darra or something for that matter. However, even if I get one that fits, it won''t still be the perfect fit that KC comes with. These belly belts are made of hard and ragged material that can hurt your skin if wore on naked skin for a prolonged period of time. I have tried KCs in the past and they are made of very fine cotton... and trust me, these are very very good.\n\nBut its better than nothing... yeah I''ll agree.

Neglecting the price difference ofcourse.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, thats like asking, which car is better? a mehran or a corolla? without taking price into consideration Corolla is definitely a better car than Mehran. similarly in absolute terms,  Hatsan Escort is definitely a better shotgun than DSA "shooter". basically it all boils down to your requirement. \r\n\r\nwhen we factor in the price versus the benefits and the intention of using the shotgun for HD only and totally disregard the level of cosmetic finish then DSA is definitely a better choice.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=common.denominator;181185]Also, could you tell me if theres any functional difference (for my purposes) between the Hatsan Escort Aimguard ([url]http://www.hatsan.com.tr/escort_aimguard.asp[/url]) and the Hatsan Escort MP ([url]http://www.hatsan.com.tr/escort_mp.asp[/url]) ?

I simply asked him to fire a tube full of shells as rapidly as if he is under attack and he is making all the lead in his disposal fly towards the assailant.\r\n\r\nand [B]to his own surprise[/B], he kept struggling with the shotgun which slipped each and every time from his hand during firing. do you know why? because, a pistol grip doesnt translate all the recoil forces to the body. the recoil is actually absorbed the web of the hand which makes such a shotgun really difficult (and utterly painful afterwards) to shoot. since the operator is giving all his attention in gripping a shotgun which is jumping all over the place, his mind totally gets off from his target and he starts missing like anything.\r\n\r\nnow you tell me, [B]would you rather hit successfully[/B] or miss severely but at least look cool while doing it. remember! looking cool carries no extra marks and there is no refund policy if you miss.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(342430, ' ^\n+1\n\n\n\nInteresting turn the debate has taken.\n\nI don''t think we''re disputing the repute of a Glock. Like other veteran members stated, Glocks are very common and popular not only in the US but in Canada and some of the European countries as well. The main reason is, like I said before, that they are cheap and highly effective in tactical situations. Glocks are pioneers in durable polymer guns and have, no doubt, become a standard in that regard. However, this thread is not about Glocks as pistols. This thread is about Glocks'' prices in PK and if these are worth the product.\n\nLike stated by other members, I believe paying 300k for a Glock or a Beretta for that matter is simply too much for the pistol you''re buying in this price from PK and is simply not worth it. That is all we''re debating.\n\nI''ll dare to make an analogy. Take IPhones for example. The 3GS model is not worth more than 320$ but is being sold here in PK for over 50k. Now the question is, is it worth paying that extra amount of money? I''d rather buy an HTC which sells for much less, closer to its original price set by the manufacturer.\n\nSo Glock becomes a generic example in this case.\n\nI agree to AK47 bhai about the counter measures that he suggests. :)', ''),

The transducer&#8217;s                         movement produces alternating high and low pressure waves within                         the liquid in the tank. The liquid is compressed during the                         high pressure phase of the wave cycle, and pulled apart during                         the low pressure phase. As the pressure in the liquid is reduced                         during the low pressure phase, cavities grow from a microscopic                         seed to a maximum critical diameter. During the subsequent                         high pressure phase they compress and implode. The energy is                         very powerful but safe for parts because it is localized at                         microscopic scale.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n                             [FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2][I]Myths                         of Ultrasonic Cleaning[/I][/SIZE][/FONT]\n                                                            \n[LIST]\n[*][FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2][B]Ultrasonic                                         cleaning with water works miracles![/B]\n                  It depends on the type of dirt to be cleaned. Just using water for ultrasonic                   cleaning, it works great with the dirt particles that are soluble in water.                   Although ultrasonic cleaning can displace insoluble dirt, it cannot prevent                   them from re-adhering back especially for oil based ones unless detergent chemical                   is used.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n[*][B][FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2] The                                     higher the ultrasonic frequency used for cleaning, the better                                     and stronger it cleans[/SIZE][/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2]\n                    The higher ultrasonic frequency creates smaller cavitation bubbles. With same                     amount of electrical energy provided, higher ultrasonic frequency creates cavitation                     bubbles that implode weaker too. They will not be able to remove away big and                     tough dirt particles. However, the higher frequency can penetrate deeper and                     clean away lower micron dirt particles. Therefore depending the type of cleaning                     application such as removing fine dirt particles experienced in optics and                     semiconductor industries, higher frequencies may cleans better.\n                                    [/SIZE][/FONT]\n[*][B][FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2]The                                     lower the ultrasonic frequency, the poorer cleaning                                         is expected.[/SIZE][/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2]\n                    Larger cavitation bubbles are created when lower ultrasonic frequencies are                     used. These bubbles implode at a much greater force compared to those generated                     by higher ultrasonic frequencies. They will be able to remove big and tough                     particles because of stronger cavitation. However, lower frequencies are less                     effective in removing very fine dirt particles. Therefore, the cleaning performance                     depends on the correct ultrasonic frequency for the type of dirt to be cleaned.\n                                      [/SIZE][/FONT]\n[*][B][FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2]Ultrasonic is only required for precision cleaning[/SIZE][/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2]\n                      Ultrasonic cleaning can also be used in traditional cleaning baths. Ultrasound                       waves provide the mechanical agitation to speed up the cleaning process. It                       also reduces the amount of cleaning chemical required to achieve the same level of cleanliness.                       Using ultrasonic cleaning provides a standard level of cleaning compared to                       manual brushing which can be unreliable. In all, ultrasonic cleaning technology                       helps to save costs and achieve better results in your cleaning processes.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n[/LIST]', ''),

[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, from purely bang for buck perspective, Hatsan Escort Combo in my humble opinion would win hands down if we define our priorities as such:\r\n\r\n1. a single shotgun that covers everything from HD to Hunting\r\n2. Budget of no more than 50K\r\n3. should atleast cover (upto a certain level of competency) everything from upland to waterfowl (hunting)\r\n4. should have one barrel with multiple chokes for various hunting requirements.\r\n5. should be reasonably reliable (though not as reliable as Pump Action) however operator is willing to go the extra mile in making sure that it stays reliable through periodical maintenance.\r\n\r\nnow if we keep the above mentioned objective in mind, Hatsan wins over Maverick. you see? pump actions are not meant for hunting, in my humble opinion they are designed for HD where minimum level of moving parts and their associated high reliability gives it an edge over other mechanisms. hence pump actions for preferred only due to their rock solid reliability. this is what is a primary requirement in HD. not in Hunting. where other requirements come into the picture such as ability to fire second shot rapidly, balance and cycling speed.\r\n\r\nit is alot easier to fire the second shot with a semi auto than with a pump. why? because when you are chuking the forend to cycle the next round your aim is way out of target and by the time you have cycled and regained your aim, your quarry is far out of range.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(342531, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nhere is a little excerpt taken from:\r\n\r\n[B]WHY YOUR 1911 AUTO PISTOL WON''T WORK!![/B] \r\nby Duane Thomas \r\nHandguns Magazine, November 1994\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************\r\nNow, here''s where I may get in trouble with a few folks. Some people seem to regard the basic 1911 design with an uncritical awe. To their minds, the 1911 represents handgun perfection; it is without flaws -- without flaws, you hear me? Any criticism of the gun threatens their perceptions of the universe. Meanwhile, back in reality, the basic 1911 is an antiquated design and it is far from perfect (sacrilege, I know). Come on, folks, if John Browning was alive today, do you really think he''d be designing guns like the 1911? Hell no, (Actually, Browning had moved far beyond the 1911 by the time he died in 1926. In his prototype for the Browning Hi-Power, already completed at the time of his death, he did away with many of the flaws of the basic 1911 design.) \r\n\r\nWithout trying too hard, I can think of four flaws in the basic 1911 design that range from moderate to serious. Several areas of the gun are prone to small-parts breakage; In some cases, when these small parts let go, the gun is totally disabled and it''ll take a pistolsmith to get it back up and running. \r\n\r\nPROBLEM #1: THE SLIDE STOP: \r\n\r\nA portion of the slide stop projects into the mag well for the purpose of engaging the magazine''s follower and locking open the action when the gun is empty. Unfortunately, this also puts the slide stop almost in the path of a cartridge coming out of the magazine. Since the slide stop is only lightly spring-loaded into the down position, if a round of ammo nudges this part during the feeding cycle, it can pop up into the slide stop notch, locking the slide back with rounds still in the gun. This can get you killed. This malfunction usually occurs, if it occurs at all, when firing the gun with hardball and less commonly with shorter hollow-point rounds. If this hasn''t happened to your gun, you probably have nothing to worry about; it''s only a problem on certain guns. If you do have this problem, a good pistolsmith can dimple the slide stop where it touches the spring-loaded plunger. If the work is done to perfection, the slide stop will never pop up on you, but will still operate perfectly to lock open the empty gun. \r\n\r\nPROBLEM #2: THE EXTRACTOR:\r\n\r\nThe amount of pressure a 1911''s extractor places on a cartridge casing''s rim is regulated by the curvature of the part in its channel through the slide. This is a crude system. Too much curvature means too much pressure, and the extractor will not allow a cartridge casing to slip up into place, resulting in a failure to feed. Not enough curvature means insufficient extractor tension, resulting in failures to fully extract and/or eject. Most modern firearms use spring-loaded extractors, a far more durable and reliable system. This is a major improvement in firearms design that seems to have passed by the 1911.\r\n\r\nThe tension of a 1911''s extractor can weaken with use. One sure way to screw up your extractor is to drop a round into the chamber with the slide open then drop the slide on the chambered cartridge. This will force the extractor to bend back and around the case rim, eventually abusing the extractor so much that it will lose its tension or even break off in extreme cases. \r\n\r\nPROBLEM #3: THE BARREL BUSHING/RECOIL SPRING PLUG:\r\n\r\nThe barrel bushing/recoil spring plug is a high-stress area of the gun. Not only does the barrel whack around in the bushing every time you fire the piece, but the full force of the recoil spring also bears upon the bushing via the recoil spring plug. If the barrel bushing gives way, your recoil spring and recoil spring plug will depart the front of the gun at high speed. Effectively, the gun is disabled. Now, this doesn''t happen very often, but I have had it happen to me while firing a Combat Commander. The bushing shattered, losing the semicircular piece that holds the recoil spring plug in the gun. My recoil system was somewhere down range, my gun out of action. I believe this occured because the slide of my gun came from the factory slightly shorter in front than it should have been. There was a fingernail-size gap between the barrel bushing''s flange and the slide; you could move the bushing back and forth with your fingertips. This being the case, of course, the bushing took a hellacious pounding as it jacked itself back and forth every time the gun was fired, and finally it gave up the ghost. You should check your gun to ensure that the bushing fits snugly into the slide.\r\n\r\nThe exact same problem can occur from a different cause: The recoil spring plug may give way. This is common with hard use of the compact Officer''s ACP guns. Most compact 1911s slavishly copy the Officer''s ACP''s recoil system, so this problem is not limited to Colts. On the Officer''s ACP, the only thing holding the recoil spring plug in the gun is a tiny tab that hooks into a slot in the slide. If that small tab gives way (and it often does), your gun is hors de combat by virtue of a missing recoil system. I''m a big fan of the aftermarket recoil spring plugs for Officer''s ACP-size guns that use a ring of metal at the rear of the plug to hold it inside the slide. There''s no way such a part can come out of the gun. \r\n\r\nPROBLEM #4: THE PLUNGER TUBE:\r\n\r\nThe plunger tube that runs between the slide stop and thumb safety is a notorious weak spot in the basic 1911 design. This tube contains two little plungers and a spring, the power of which serves both to hold the slide stop in the down position until operated by the follower of the empty magazine as well as to hold the thumb safety lever in the safe or fire position. This is a high-stress area of the gun; every time you flip your thumb safety on or off, you apply force to the plunger tube. Unfortunately, the plunger tube is held to the side of the gun only by two small studs that pass through holes in the frame. It is not at all unusual for one of these studs (almost invariably the rear one) to snap off. I''ve had this happen myself while shooting, and I''ve seen it happen to other shooters. When this happens, your thumb-safety lever will wind up in a half-on/half-off position. In an emergency, it would be possible to physically hold the safety lever down in the fire position and still shoot the piece. However, for all practical purposes, the gun is disabled until the plunger tube is replaced. \r\n\r\nThere''s really nothing you can do about this problem except to keep a close eye on your gun''s plunger tube for signs of looseness. Some folks say that if your plunger tube is loose, you should simply have it restaked. I don''t know about that. If the plunger tube has been loose for any amount of time, that rear stud has probably been abused enough that I''d probably feel better myself simply replacing the tube with a new part. So, there''s a lot to know about the ol'' 1911, huh? It''s not exactly the simplest or most maintenance-free design out there. The trick here is to enjoy the 1911 design for its strengths, but at the same time don''t deny its weaknesses. Let me summarize my advice to maximize your 1911 auto''s reliability: Load it with good hollow-point ammunition featuring a feed profile as close to hardball as possible. Use only top-quality magazines. Keep the gun clean and well lubricated. Check your bushing''s fit in the slide. Regularly check your extractor tension and the plunger tube staked to the side of the gun for any looseness. If either of these areas shows problems, move instantly to rectify them.\r\n*******************************************************************\r\nSource: [URL="http://www.sightm1911.com/Care/1911_Maintain.htm"]http://www.sightm1911.com/Care/1911_Maintain.htm[/URL]\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Please allow me to add: the extraction port on the 1911s should also be lowered on the ejection side (forgot the proper measurement) because sometimes an expended cartridge will collide causing a FTF.  The ejection port should also be beveled in the rear side of the port.  The barrel bushing should be changed and a solid barrel should be adopted so that there is little of no chance of the solid bushing breaking.  Bro, the list goes on and on.  In most cases today, the latest models of 1911s have all these features incorporated.  But does that mean that the older model 1911 owners should feel cautious about using their 1911s?  Absolutely not.  Glock some years ago during a demonstration at the LasVegas Shot Show managed to have their pistol''s recoil guide rod break in front of millions of people.  Has anyone forum member here have this happen to their Glock?  I have not had this happen.  Same goes for the 1911, I have never in the past 20+ years had a 1911 break on me.

(342576, 'CZ Arms - From Where &amp; How Originated [FONT=Times New Roman][U]Overview of Ceska Zbrojovka History and Handgun Production [/U][/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nCZ-UB, or Ceska Zbrojovka - Uhersky Brod (literally "Czech Weapons Factory - Uhersky Brod") began life as a satellite plant of the original Ceska Zbrojovka enterprise, Ceska Zbrojovka, a.s., Praha, a joint-stock company that was partially nationalized in the late 1930s. CZ-UB was originally known as Ceska Zbrojovka, a.s., Praha, zavod v Uherskem Brode ("Czech Weapons Factory, joint-stock company of Prague, Plant at Uhersky Brod") from its inception in 1936 to 1945. However, the full story of the company we know as "CZ" begins at the birth of the Czechoslovak Republic, shortly after World War I. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]It is impossible to tell the story of Ceska Zbrojovka without first discussing Zbrojovka Brno. Officially founded in 1917, Zbrojovka Brno ("Weapons Factory of Brno") had played a small, but vital role in the first World War. Brno is the former capital of the Kingdom of Moravia, and it is also the second largest city in the Czech lands. The Brno arsenal would soon make a name for Czech firearms in the European civilian market, but the Brno plant lacked the overall capacity to rearm an entire nation. As the only major established arsenal, the renamed Ceskoslovenska Zbrojovka Brno tackled several high-priority projects in 1919-1920. These included the manufacture of railway rolling stock, design and manufacture of hand grenades, and the re-arsenaling of Austrian 8mm M-95 Mannlicher rifles. Beginning in 1921, Brno began manufacture of Mauser Gewehr 98 rifles, since German production was prevented by the Versailles Treaty. While this meant that Brno would be better known for most of the 20th century, it created a unique opportunity for the development of Ceska Zbrojovka. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nThe forerunner of CZ-UB was the enterprise Jihoceska Zbrojovka, which was established at Plzen in 1919. In 1921, Jihoceska Zbrojovka moved to Strakonice. In 1922, the company absorbed the Hubertus Company, which had facilities at Vejprty and Prague. At this time, the company was renamed Ceska Zbrojovka. By 1923, these facilities were known as Ceská Zbrojovka v Praze ("Czech Weapons Factory of Prague") and Ceská Zbrojovka v Praze, Továrny ve Strakonicích ("Czech Weapons Factory of Prague, Strakonice Plant"). Various firms in the Czechoslovak Republic and Western  Europe supplied some of the necessary parts during this period. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nBy 1924, the general policy of the Czech arms industry emerged: Zbrojovka Brno would make bolt-action rifles and Ceska Zbrojovka would make virtually everything else (mostly pistols, machine guns, aircraft armament, and signal guns). With the notable exception of the vz-24 pistol, which was also exported, Ceska Zbrojovka focused on contracts for the Czechoslovak military and police from 1924-1938. During this period, production at Brno concentrated on the vz-24 Czech Mauser for the Czech military and export. The emphasis on export was intended to garner foreign currency for modernization of the Czech arms industry. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nNotable handguns of this period included the vz-26 and vz-27 series. The vz-26 is incredibly rare; it is essentially a locked, rotating barrel version of the vz-22/vz-24 series pistol. The vz-26 was also chambered in .380 ACP., but it did not enter regular production. Apparently, all known vz-26s were made at the Prague plant. Production quantities from 1919-1926 and the progression of the vz-22 through vz-26 models suggest batch production by professional gunsmiths. This also partially explains the use of locked breech mechanisms for the .380 ACP in Ceska Zbrojovka designs, since .380 ACP does not require them. In 1927, expansion of the Prague plant set the stage for the large-scale production of a standard model Czechoslovakian service pistol. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nMost industrial production in Czechoslovakia was concentrated either in Western Bohemia, including the capital of Prague, or the general area of Brno in Moravia. The development of the Brno area and the presence of Zbrojovka Brno made it an attractive area for the relocation of all strategic industries. Furthermore, Ceska Zbrojovka production was divided between the two main facilities at Prague and Strakonice, as well as smaller facilities, which still produced some parts. The Czech Defense Ministry realized that this situation was less than ideal for large-scale production employing assembly lines. Consequently, the Czechoslovakian government partially nationalized Ceska Zbrojovka and began a gigantic movement of its assets to Moravia (the eastern portion of the current Czech Republic, and geographical center of the former Czechoslovakia). In 1936, construction began on a much larger new facility in Uhersky Brod, which is close to Brno The long-term plan called for a shift of all Ceska Zbrojovka assets and production to Uhersky Brod, but this was not complete when Germany invaded in 1939. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nFrom 1936-1938, Ceska Zbrojovka handgun production decreased in favor of other armaments, notably machine guns and aircraft armament. Handgun production at Strakonice and Prague was limited to the vz-27, and the Uhersky Brod factory produced the CZ "vestpocket" .25 ACP for civilian use and export. CZ-UB would go on to manufacture several models in .25 ACP for export well into the 1960s, including the DUO and Z models. As the Germans closed in, production began on the vz-38 pistol. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nThe vz-38 is one of the most ungainly pistols ever manufactured in large numbers. The vz-38 is often called the "nutcracker," because the frame has a large hinge beneath the muzzle. This allows a catch to open the action, and the barrel and slide tilt upwards for disassembly. While this may be the easiest semi-automatic handgun ever made to field strip and clean, the design is terrible. The pistol is too large and heavy for the .380 ACP cartridge, it does not point well, and the heavy DAO lockwork makes accuracy impossible. Presumably, the design was intended to make manufacture of large numbers possible for the Czechs in 1938, but the Nazi decision to continue production seems illogical. The vz-38 appears to use as much material as a Walther P-38 or Radom wz-35, for example. Given the documented incidents of the Czech arms industry subverting and sabotaging production, I suspect that Ceska Zbrojovka was quite happy to arm the Nazis with this third-rate weapon. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nCeska Zbrojovka handgun production concentrated on the vz-27 and vz-38 during the war (1939-1945). During the Nazi occupation, production nominally controlled by Ceska Zbrojovka continued at Prague, Strakonice, and Uhersky Brod. The production of parts and ammunition appears to have been widely dispersed as the war progressed. Most pistols are marked either "CESKA ZBROJOVKA A.S. V PRAZE" or "BOHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK PRAG," regardless of the actual plant of manufacture. It is unclear how many handguns were manufactured by the Uhersky Brod plant during the war. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nCzechoslovakia was "liberated" by the Soviet army in 1945, and Soviet administration was recognized by the Yalta Agreement. This ultimately led to the full nationalization and reorganization of the entire Czech arms industry by the Soviet-backed communist regime. The Strakonice and Prague facilities ceased small arms production in 1954. By 1954, all production of arms, ammunition, and related materials was controlled by a central state planning agency/management group (consistent with Stalin''s "collectivist" model of production). Between 1954 and 1988, production of virtually all small arms centralized at Ceska Zbrojovka-Uhersky Brod and Zbrojovka Brno. From 1965 to 1988, Zbrojovka Brno and Ceska Zbrojovka were drawn together by the communist regime under some form of central management. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nFrom 1946 to 1988, the Czechoslovak Proof Authority required that "Any firearm exported will bear the BRNO markings." This policy reflected the greater name recognition of Zbrojovka Brno in Western Europe; in practical terms, it often meant that Western shooters were not aware of the existence of the Strakonice and Uhersky Brod arsenals. Another confusing aspect of this policy is the inconsistent use of the designations vz (vzor) and "CZ" on Czech firearms. Generally, Czech firearms were known by their military designation, which followed the convention of vzor (model) and a two-digit number representing the year of introduction (i.e. "vz-45"). Civilian arms or exported military surplus have often been marked with "CZ" in place of "vz" or given a model name incorporating "CZ." Also, some export handguns were proof-marked with the convention of "CZ" and a two-digit number representing the year of manufacture (such as the "CZ 27" example above), regardless of the model or place of manufacture. This has led to considerable confusion in the West about which factory manufactured certain models. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nFrom 1946 to 1992, "CZ" was reorganized no less than six times to conform with the CSSR economic plan. Since these changes relate to production goals and marketing strategies for Ceska Zbrojovka products, it may be helpful to outline the various organizational systems. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nBroadly, the Uhersky Brod factory was fully nationalized and administered as a satellite of the Strakonice factory from 1946-1950, rather than Prague, as had been the case for the previous decade. From 1946-1950, CZ-UB was officially known as Ceska Zbrojovka, narodni podnik, Strakonice, zavod v Uherskem Brode ("Czech Weapons Factory, national enterprise of Strakonice, Plant at Uhersky Brod"). CZ-UB handgun production during this period concentrated on the vz-45 pistol in .25 ACP (6.35x16mm, 6.35 Browning) for export. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nFrom 1950-1958, CZ-UB was known as Zavody Presneho Strojirenstvi, narodni podnik, Uhersky Brod ("Precision Engineering Factories, national enterprise, Uhersky Brod"); under this model, CZ-UB became a independent concern reporting to a central administrative unit. Most of the successful postwar Ceska Zbrojovka designs prior to the CZ-75 entered serial production from 1950-1958. During this period, the Uhersky Brod plant conducted limited research and testing, although the majority of Czechoslovak research and development was conducted at Prague and Brno. The most significant development was the government''s decision to centralize handgun production at Uhersky Brod after the Strakonice and Prague plants ceased producing arms. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nCZ-UB production during this period concentrated on the vz-50 semi-automatic pistol in .32 ACP (7.65x17mm), vz-52 semi-automatic rifle in 7.62x45mm, vz-58 automatic rifle in 7.62x39mm, and a wide variety of submachine gun models (vz-23, vz-24, vz-25, and vz-26) in .32 ACP, .380 ACP, and 7.62x25mm Tokarev. The vz-52 semi-automatic pistol in 7.62x25mm was also introduced in this period. This model was actually designed by the Brno R&D team, but the original vz-52 pistols were manufactured at Strakonice from 1952-1954. Brno primarily produced bolt action rifles on the Mauser pattern for export during this period. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nFrom 1958-1965, all Czechoslovak industry was reorganized into units known as VHJ (Productive Economic Units), or related industries organized under one umbrella company reporting to the competent ministry. Under this model, CZ-UB was known as Zavody Rijnove Revoluce, n.p. Vsetin, zavod 5 Uhersky Brod ("Factories of the October Revolution, national enterprise of Vsetin, plant 5 Uhersky Brod") and managed by ZRR, n.p. Vsetin. This basic model remained in place, but CZ-UB reported to Zbrojovka Brno from 1965-1982. More specifically, CZ-UB was organized under VHJ Zbrojovka Brno Main Directorate and known as Presne Strojirenstvi, n.p., Uhersky Brod ("Precision Engineering, national enterprise, Uhersky Brod"). The Zbrojovka Brno VHJ was responsible for agricultural machinery, service arms, and special products for export. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nThus, CZ-UB was under some sort of trust management from 1958-1982, but the relationship between Zbrojovka Brno and Ceska Zbrojovka-UB was more pragmatic and had some precedent in the independent interwar period. The Defense Ministry appears to have centralized research in Prague for most of the late 1940s and 1950s, but research and development shifted to Brno by the late 1960s. As will be discussed below, development of the CZ-75 eventually led to independent research and development at the Uhersky Brod plant. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nThe initial period of trust management under ZRR, n.p. Vsetin from 1958-1965 was a fairly uneventful period in the history of CZ-UB. The Uhersky Brod facility became little more than a manufacturing plant for the vz-50 semi-automatic pistol, adopted by the Czechoslovak police, and various submachine gun models for the Czech military and export. The only notable new product during this period was the vz-61 Skorpion submachine gun in .32 ACP (7.65x17mm, 7.65 Browning). This led to an entire family of Skorpion submachine guns for export: the vz-64 (9x17mm), vz-65 (9x18mm), and vz-68 (9x19mm). [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nBeginning in 1965, centralization of all small arms production under the management of Zbrojovka Brno would have a profound effect on the Czech arms industry. It is no accident that the biggest event in CZ-UB history, the development of CZ-75, happened in this period. Although CZ-UB had manufactured many products for export from 1946 to 1965, notably submachine guns for foreign militaries, the actual staff and workers at Uhersky Brod had little contact with their military customers and none at all with their civilian customers. Essentially, this was a direct result of state control of the export of firearms via the Czechoslovakian Ministry of Foreign Trade. More specifically, Ceska Zbrojovka had traditionally dominated the military market, while Zbrojovka Brno dominated the European civilian market. In other words, only the Zbrojovka Brno staff had any practical experience with the requirements of the civilian export market and the range of competing foreign products. Closer affiliation with Brno opened many doors for CZ-UB and encouraged closer cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Trade - Main Technical Administration (MZO-HTS). This led to CZ-UB staff accompanying Zbrojovka Brno staff on several business trips to Western Europe in the late 1960s. As will be discussed below, this was critical to the development of the CZ 75. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]From 1965-1982, CZ-UB production focused on the vz-70 semi-automatic pistol in .32 ACP (an updated version of the vz-50 semi-auto), the CZ 75 semi-automatic pistol in 9mm Parabellum (9x19mm, 9mm Luger), the Skorpion series of SMGs, and the vz-82 semi-automatic pistol in 9x18mm Makarov, which was adopted by the Czech military. Other products produced in smaller numbers included revolvers for export, new production vz-52 semi-automatic pistols chambered in 9mm Parabellum (9x19mm), sporting rifles of the Mauser pattern, and sporting shotguns. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]The history of the CZ 75 merits a short book of its own, and at least two have been published since the 1990s. Briefly, CZ-UB representatives began to lobby for a new handgun design in 9mm Parabellum for export, due to their experiences in Western Europe and Africa. Even in the Americas, which were mostly closed to Czechoslovakian exports, collectors and other shooters were familiar with 9mm Parabellum via WWII surplus handguns such as the P-08 Luger, Walther P-38, Radom wz-35, and Ingliss version of the FN Hi-Power. Several employees of CZ-UB, notably the plant''s technical manager, Milos Plocek, were convinced that 9mm Parabellum was becoming the dominant service pistol cartridge everywhere outside the Warsaw Pact, assuming it had not already done so. Problematically, CZ-UB was slightly ahead of the curve, both in terms of demand for a new 9mm pistol and production capacity. In other words, serviceable WWII surplus handguns and submachine guns in 9mm Parabellum were still available in many parts of the world. Similarly, CZ-UB lacked the capacity and equipment to produce handgun frames suitable for 9mm Parabellum. My impression is that the Uhersky Brod facility was overdue for some modernization and improvements by the late 1960s, as well. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]Being slightly ahead of the curve proved to be a great blessing. Essentially, CZ-UB had seven years to address some of the technical problems raised by a major project like the CZ 75 while Frantisek Koucky perfected the design of the pistol. In 1969, CZ-UB was able to hire Koucky directly, since he had retired from his military commission and R&D post in 1967. Koucky and his older brother, Josef Koucky, were both talented firearms designers with long-standing ties to the Defense Ministry. For these reasons, the Defense Ministry allowed Frantisek Koucky to work with little interference. The Ministry gave Koucky only the broadest specifications: a pistol chambered in 9mm Parabellum for export; shortly thereafter, the Defense Ministry added that the design must have a high capacity magazine and be capable of double action operation. In 1970, Koucky and Plocek assembled a small research and development team at the Uhersky Brod plant. After the production of two major prototypes in the early 1970s and test batches in 1975-1976, actual serial production of the CZ 75 began in 1977. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]Although the history of the CZ 75 is beyond the scope of this article, it is worth mentioning a common fallacy. Writers often state that the CZ 75 combines the best features of all previous successful 9mm service pistols, but this is misleading. Evidence cited for this "amalgamation" theory includes superficial resemblances to the Browning Hi-Power and the incorporation of certain features of the SIG P-210. Like the SIG P-210, the CZ 75 slide rides on rails inside the frame, rather than grooves outside the frame. While this theory seems logical, it is completely false. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]While there is no denying the influence of John Browning on Frantisek Koucky, the CZ 75 qualifies as a "new" design in every sense of the word. When Koucky began work in 1970-1971 on an all-steel, full size pistol chambered in 9mm Parabellum with DA capability and a high capacity magazine, only one model in the entire world fit that description: the Smith & Wesson Model 59. While the S&W M-59 is an excellent pistol, it was never adopted as a service pistol in any significant numbers. (The Beretta 92FS was introduced in 1976, roughly at the same time as the CZ 75, but the Beretta was not an all-steel model or capable of being carried in Condition One.) Koucky appears to have borrowed the internal rail system from previous Brno designs, not the SIG P-210. Most DA/SA pistols prior to the CZ 75 were derivative of the Walther design; all previous DA/SA models employed a single trigger bar like the Walther. Koucky saw that this made the DA pull of these pistols much heavier than necessary and contributed to breakage. Koucky''s double trigger bar and related trigger design were true innovations. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]Changes in CSSR economic policy scrapped the VHJ trust management system for concern-type management from 1983-1988. Under this arrangement, VHJ Zbrojovka Brno Main Directorate was renamed Agrozet Koncern Zemedelskeho Strojirenstvi, Brno ("Concern Enterprise for Agricultural Machinery, Brno"), and CZ-UB became Agrozet Uhersky Brod, Koncernovy Podnik ("Agrozet Uhersky Brod, Concern Enterprise"). Presumably, this had little effect on day-to-day operations, since CZ-UB had reported to Zbrojovka Brno for over seventeen years by this point. At any rate, the Agrozet management system proved to be the last gasp of the collectivist model.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]CZ-UB production from 1983-1988 concentrated on the vz-82 service pistol for the Czech military, the virtually identical CZ 83 for export in .32 ACP (7.65x17mm),.380 ACP (9x17mm), and 9mm Makarov (9x18mm), and the CZ-75 and its variants, including the CZ 85. Other production included parts for the Skorpion SMG series, sporting rifles of the Mauser pattern, and sporting shotguns. CZ 75/85 series pistols accounted for the majority of CZ-UB exports for the first time. Perhaps even more importantly, clone versions of the CZ 75 began to appear in the West. By the early 1990s, companies as diverse as ITM (Switzerland), Israeli Military Industries, Sphinx (Switzerland), Springfield Arms, and Tanfoglio (Italy) had manufactured handguns based on the CZ 75 design. While the CZ 75 may be among the most pirated firearm designs in history, it is undeniable that the clone versions helped to publicize the CZ 75 in countries banning the importation of arms from Warsaw Pact nations. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nIn 1988, as the communist system collapsed, CZ-UB regained some of its independence. From 1988-1992, CZ was known as Ceska Zbrojovka, statni podnik, Uhersky Brod ("Czech Weapons Factory, state enterprise, Uhersky Brod"). This period offered dramatic opportunities for marketing, export, and modernization. In my opinion, this decentralization in the last days of communist period set the stage for CZ-UB to emerge as the dominant arms manufacturer in the current Czech  Republic. (As I am writing this in 2007, CZ-UB has announced that it will be purchasing Zbrojovka Brno outright.) Production expanded considerably during this brief period, both in terms of the sheer number of guns manufactured and the number of available models for export. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nSince 1992, Ceska Zbrojovka has literally returned to its roots, and it is once again a fully independent joint-stock company, Ceska Zbrojovka, a.s., Uhersky Brod. Growing sophistication in the marketing and promotion of its products, coupled with frustrations with earlier importers, led CZ-UB management to establish CZ-USA in 1991 as its importer and distributor in the United States. In practical terms, CZ-USA did not become the sole importer of CZ-UB products until 1997. CZ-USA was originally located in Oakhurst, California, but moved to its current location in Kansas City, Kansas in 1998. From 1998 to present, the civilian market in North America has become the primary customer for CZ-UB products. [/FONT]\n  [FONT=Times New Roman]\nBy 1993, Czechoslovakia had split into two democratic republics: the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic (also known as Slovakia). Virtually all military production of all types was clustered in Moravia, or the eastern portion of the Czech Republic. As the centralized and nationalized military industrial complex began to fragment, several facilities nominally affiliated with either Brno or CZ-UB started new lives as independent firms. Also, major industrial concerns, such as the old Strakonice plant (which had mostly produced heavy machinery and motorcycles from 1954-1991) recommenced small arms production. An influx of foreign capital stimulated new private companies in the arms and munitions fields. As such, many companies producing small arms began to emerge in the late 1990s. Confusingly, virtually all of them incorporate "CZ" into their names and/or the markings on their weapons. In the last decade, other companies in the Czech Republic either manufacturing or exporting arms included Alfa-Proj, Arms Moravia, Ceska Zbrojovka-Strakonice, and Zbrojovka Brno. Presumably, the Zbrojovka Brno plant will continue to manufacture arms under CZ-UB ownership.[/FONT]\n  \n  [FONT=Times New Roman]http://czechpistols82792.yuku.com/topic/16482/Overview-of-Ceska-Zbrojovka-History-and-Handgun-Production[/FONT]', ''),

The 1911''s overwhelming virtue is how easy it is to shoot. Quite simply, the 1911 design gives us the shortest, most controllable trigger pull of any handgun. In this area, all other one-hand guns must take a back seat to the grand old design. In my recent article on the easiest handguns to shoot, the Colt Government Model outshot several of the more modern designs, placing third out of five guns I tested. I believe it might have placed even higher, but I was determined that all the guns in my shootout be as stock as possible, so before testing the Government Model I replaced the excellent wooden Spegel grips the piece normally wore with the rubber wraparound grips that had come stock on the gun. The rubber wraparounds really bulked up the grip, changing a gun that had fit my hand wonderfully well into a gun that didn''t fit my hand at all. The fact that I was still able to fire the piece well is, I feel, a tribute to the Government Model''s inherent shootability.\n\nAnother thing I like very much about the 1911 is that it''s the only serious, heavy-duty combat handgun out there that can be totally detail stripped without tools. Not to get too Zen here, but when I know I can totally disassemble my carry gun and put it back together again using nothing but my own hands, it gives me a wonderful sense of being one with the gun.\n\nNo, the 1911 is not a gun for the casually interested. However, for the dedicated shooter who''s willing to take the time to get to know the design intimately, the 1911 is still a superior choice in a defensive handgun. Unlike most things in life, the 1911 has strengths that more than compensate for its flaws.

(342578, ' :) A thread about 1911s... yummy :)\r\n\r\nLet me state here first off... that I am a die hard fan of 1911s and the ONLY gun that I own currently and use exclusively is a PT-1911. (I see whats coming... sometimes its fun to be labeled ;))\r\n\r\nJust like any other gun ever made, 1911s aint perfect. Being a ''pioneer'' in the ''modern'' gun technology (the recoil-operated semi-automatics) John Browning''s principle of the ''short-recoil'' is the main feature of any so called modern handgun today. Yes there have been improvements over the time, but the basic principle that almost every handgun of today uses is the same: JB''s SRS (Short Recoil System). A fun fact is that most Glock users who like to diss 1911s don''t know that their guns are short-recoil operated too. I told this to a friend of mine and he was like "what? really?" lol\r\n\r\nSo what makes a 1911 more desirable than any other handgun out there? For me, its the soul. It is the individual personality of each of the 1911, and the extra amount of care that it needs more than any other gun that makes it desirable for me. Its like saying that my 1911 is MY 1911. I have tweaked it, customized it to my preferences and it aint some gun you can just pick up off a counter. My 1911 is MY 1911. It aint A GLOCK 17, which are all the same. When you put so much time cleaning, customizing and training with your 1911, it truly becomes an extension of your psyche. Thats what I dig.\r\n\r\nThey say, if someone else has said it before you and for you, you should quote unless you can top the quote. I may be able to top what Tom Givens said about 1911s, but for now, lemme just quote him:\r\n\r\n"As a "fighting" handgun, a properly set up and tuned 1911 has no equal. It has superb ergonomics, redundant safeties, excellent reliability and longevity, and the best trigger action available on any common service pistol. The trigger alone makes it the easiest service pistol to shoot well at speed. My primary handgun every single day, 365 days a year, is a lightly customized 1911.\r\n\r\nThat said, the 1911 is NOT a gun for the casual user, or what we call NDP''s (non-dedicated personnel). The gun was designed when technology was expensive, but skilled labor was not. The exact opposite is true today. A carry 1911 should be gone over by an experienced specialist (Heinie, Burns, Yam, Yost, Garthwaite, etc) and then properly maintained by the end user. The average cop or typical CCW holder would be better served with a Glock or SIG in most cases. If you''re willing to spend the money to get a properly set up 1911 and TRAIN with it, then you''re not "average".\r\n\r\nLast year I took three classes as a student (Taylor, Gonzales, Suarez) and the year before one from Clint Smith. In each of those classes I fired about 800 rounds through my carry 1911 without cleaning it and with zero malfunctions. At the NTI last year, I dropped an impact target with about an eight inch square vital zone at approximately 80 yards, from an awkward position, with one shot from my carry 1911, while being filmed by a TV crew. The superb trigger on my gun made that a lot easier. Since I have a choice in my personal weapons, I choose to carry the system that stacks the odds in my favor. My life is worth the extra expense/effort. YMMV."\r\n\r\nThe operative word being "dedication". The so called ''modern'' firearms require less maintenance and are prone to less malfunctions even if not ''treated well'' and, thence, require absolutely no commitment or dedication from the user. These are tools for tactical survival. And thats that. Its like comparing samurai art of war with modern day ju jitsu survival techniques. Samurai is a way of life. It is a philosophy. Modern defensive techniques are simply that: defensive tactics without a higher intellectual or philosophical value. Or something like that :)\r\n\r\nHaving said that, a well-maintained, properly broken-in and customized 1911 would never malfunction more than any other out-of-the-box pistol ever could. In fact, a well maintained 1911 can offer more reliability than any other pistol ever made. \r\n\r\nHere is another quote... this one by Clint Smith:\r\n\r\n“The 1911 remains popular because it’s an efficient tool. In more than 30 years of experience, I’ve met more competent, serious gunmen who carry 1911’s than those who pack any other handgun. They are professionals – policemen, government agents and others who carry handguns daily because the know their live may depend on it…Me? I’ve carried a 1911 every single day for the past 20 years. It’s a very comforting gun to have at your hip. It offers a good, consistent single-action trigger pull and is wonderfully dependable. Because the 1911 is basically a defensive handgun, I’m not concerned about tight groups. I don’t bother with expanding hollowpoints that could cause feeding problems. For absolute reliability, I shoot only high-quality ball ammunition. That big .45 slug doesn’t have to expand to be effective.” \r\n\r\nRosco S. Benson on rec.guns “Is the 1911 an Outdated Design?”:\r\n\r\n"Of course the 1911 is an outdated design. It came from an era when weapons were designed to win fights, not to avoid product liability lawsuits. It came from an era where it was the norm to learn how your weapon operated and to practice that operation until it became second nature, not to design the piece to the lowest common denominator. It came from an era in which our country tried to supply its fighting men with the best tools possible, unlike today, when our fighting men and women are issued hardware that was adopted because of international deal-making or the fact that the factory is in some well-connected congressman''s district. Yes, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the 1911 IS an outdated design....and that''s exactly what I love about it."\r\n\r\nNow thats the difference! For a non-dedicated casual user, a million reasons could be found to not to adopt a 1911 battery. But for an above-average dedicated 1911 dh, thats the only way to go.\r\n\r\nOne last quote... from Jeff Cooper\r\n\r\n“The 1911 pistol remains the service pistol of choice in the eyes of those who understand the problem. Back when we audited the FBI academy in 1947, I was told that I ought not to use my pistol in their training program because it was not fair. Maybe the first thing one should demand of his sidearm is that it be unfair.” \r\n\r\n— Guns & Ammo, January 2002\r\n\r\n[All quotes taken from [url]http://www.sightm1911.com][/url]\r\n\r\nNow don''t get me wrong. I maybe 1911 biased... but I am not dissing any other make. All have their appropriate places in modern history and may fit different systems of CC/SD/HD. I am also a huge fan of HK and have shot HK USP45 many times and love it. But I like the 1911s better... for their aesthetic value (beautiful beautiful guns), their customizing options and the connection. But thats my personal choice. Thats just me. \r\n\r\nOn the tactical side, I have never come across another gun with as crisp a trigger as a 1911. The trigger my father''s Kimber had was unbelievable. I have not been able to do a mozambique drill in under 2.5 secs with any other gun ever. Maybe its ''cuz of my bigger hands... and when I acquire a two-handed high-thumbed tactical grip on other pistols, it makes my trigger finger not reach properly the trigger and causes me to yank at it instead of pressing it with consistent movement. Plus the DA/SA trigger has never been my cup of tea. For its trigger alone, I would choose a 1911 over any other pistol any given day if I had a choice for only one pistol. If I could get more I would add an HK USP45 and a Walther P99 to my battery of arms. \r\n\r\n@ 12 Gauge brother...\r\n\r\nLike you stated brother, Taurus PT-1911 is a ''budget'' gun... so you would expect that from it. Once you get the extractor replaced and have some 1000 rounds through it, hopefully it won''t agitate you again ;)\r\n\r\nThe quote about the ''4 shortcomings'' was very nice. It is common knowledge about 1911s though. It is what we call "known issues" in IT language. And the answer is given towards the end of the article itself, that with proper maintenance, proper ammo and an ''eye-out'' for anything out of the usual, none of these issues should be a problem.\r\n\r\nSo I wish you all the best mate. Just a humble request though from a 1911 DH: don''t give up on the 1911s so soon :) :) lol\r\n\r\nBy the way... Here is an intellectual question to all that assume 1911s have weaknesses:\r\n\r\nWhat do you define as a weakness? Is it an innate shortcoming, a weakness beyond cure in most of the cases, a humane situation viz-a-viz the Divine? Do you think guns can actually have weaknesses or strengths? Aren''t these simple tools in the hands of a warrior? The weakness of a weapon is the weakness of its master. Don''t be a slave to your weapon system, be its master. Know it inside out. Enjoy a command over it not be a subordinate to it.\r\n\r\nThe weapon is the mind... not the gun. If you think guns win wars, think again, you might not have read you art of war thoroughly enough. Men win wars. If you are not willing to defend yourself, your freedom or your family, no gun would ever do it for you. \r\n\r\nTwo cents from a 1911 fan :)', ''),

Like other veteran members stated, Glocks are very common and popular not only in the US but in Canada and some of the European countries as well. The main reason is, like I said before, that they are cheap and highly effective in tactical situations. Glocks are pioneers in durable polymer guns and have, no doubt, become a standard in that regard. However, this thread is not about Glocks as pistols. This thread is about Glocks'' prices in PK and if these are worth the product.\r\n\r\nLike stated by other members, I believe paying 300k for a Glock or a Beretta for that matter is simply too much for the pistol you''re buying in this price from PK and is simply not worth it. That is all we''re debating.\r\n\r\nI''ll dare to make an analogy. Take IPhones for example. The 3GS model is not worth more than 320$ but is being sold here in PK for over 50k. Now the question is, is it worth paying that extra amount of money? I''d rather buy an HTC which sells for much less, closer to its original price set by the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nSo Glock becomes a generic example in this case.\r\n\r\nI agree to AK47 bhai about the counter measures that he suggests. :)[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nCD bro, Its a good example that you used.

The extractor is actually the first thing that should be ''tweaked'' and ''changed'' on a 1911 when you first buy the gun. Then there are other maintenance tasks which include tweaking the barrel bushing etc for a reliability unmatched by any other firearm. If I own a 1911 for SD (and I do by the way) I will make sure these tweaks were in place. And once these are and I have at least 500 rounds through it, I will bet my life on it every given day. Cuz it would thence become the most reliable firearm one can imagine. Thats actually the Philosophy of Use for 1911s. \r\n\r\nThere are endless testimonials of professionals for 1911s, people who have bet their lives on a customized well-maintained 1911 and never had a complaint. Just to give you an example, each member of the LAPD SWAT unit bets his/her life on a Kimber every day... in high risk situations. They''ve never been let down.

I have covered it in my earlier posts though. But lemme have a go at it again :)\n\nFirst off thank you for your kind comments. I appreciate your appreciation :)\n\nAnd before I go into the reliability issues, lemme just address your ''service'' theme quickly. You are absolutely right. Service sidearms are not easy to replace and hence, maybe, this was the reason that M1911A1 was used exclusively in WW1, WW2, Korean and Vietnam wars by the US. However, it is a MAYBE... not a fact.\n\nI would draw your attention to the current usage of the customized 1911s. Like I mentioned before, it is the official LAPD SWAT sidearm... and they adopted it in an era where there were plenty of options to go for other "much sophisticated" handguns, as you put it. Still they chose Kimbers over all other brands. It doesnt get more tactical than the Special Weapons And Tactics team... and their weapon of choice, in modern era, is a 1911. That, alone, speaks volumes for its effectiveness.\n\nNow about the reliability. In today''s world where the paid labor costs have increased and technology is cheaper, it is but natural to rely on technology alone. Today''s world is fast, mechanically fueled, providing less opportunities for intellectual or philosophical deliberations into wars or armed conflicts. You do a job, have a wife and kids that you gotta pick up and drop off... pay bills, then work some more etc etc. There is less time for a gun that you keep. Of course someone salaried and married with all the ''ghan chakars'' of life would only be too unrealistic in thinking that he can put in time and efforts a 1911 requires to be perfect. If thats the case, then definitely the life of this kind of an individual cannot depend on a 1911. He has to choose a different weapon system, something like a Glock 17/19, which doesn''t require more than a casual tipping off in the name of maintenance once in a while. Can shoot under adverse situations without maintenance and can feed all kinda cheap ammo without much problems. Thats the practical solution. If the price in PK is the practical problem, then even the Walthers and their likes can do the job.\n\nOn the other hand, if I were to travel a lot, including on foot tactical travel, were to shoot under extreme weather condition where my gun was gonna be dripping with mud all the time, with no leverage or time-window to clean and lubricate my gun properly... then an out of the box 1911 would definitely not be the first weapon on my list. I would rather go with an SW M&P 45 or an HK USP45. Internal striker fired and reliable out-of-the-box tools without any extra efforts on the part of the operative. That''s the kinda gun I''d probably bet my life on in the given situation. However, if I had MY 1911, customized and tweaked, with which I have had a lot of training time, I would prefer to carry it over these other weapon systems.\n\nThe arguments biol down to two major points:\n\n1. Are 1911s reliable guns out of the box?\n\nNo. You gotta put in some effort to make em absolute. Once they are, however, they are the most reliable guns in the world. \n\n2. Apart from their aesthetic/fun and historical value, is there any practical reason why I should choose to run with a 1911 and bet my life on it every given day.\n\nFirst off, it is beyond any doubt that 1911s are the most beautiful guns out there and the most pleasurable to shoot with on the range. Thats something the MAJORITY accepts.\n\nNow the practical side: Like I said before, you gotta be the master of your weapon not its slave. If you know it inside out, you will know what needs to be tweaked and done before you start to depend on it. And thats what it takes for a 1911 user to become above-average.\n\nTo answer your question dear sir, for a serious SD/PDW, 1911 absolutely rocks IF (and thats a big if) you are able to put time and effort into it.\n\nAnd the end of the day, it all comes down to the personal preferences. For me, I would bet my life even on my bare hands cuz I know I am good with em.\n\nSee if I don''t like a pistol, I wont practice much with, I wont care much for it. With practice and effort, if you like a pistol, ANY pistol, it will become reliable for you. This is true for any weapon. I remember when I was traning for martial arts, I never liked Nunchaku and always preferred a cane over it. The result being that I was able to defeat multiple opponents with nunchakus with my cane. So that became my weapon of choice. Any experienced martial artist would say that nunchaku is much ''superior'' to a bamboo stick... but then I aint good with those. That''s how it works.\n\nRegards mate :)', ''),

In my recent posts, I was talking generally about the 1911s and not particularly about the Taurus PT.\n\nThe PT-1911 I got cost me 90k, which is almost equal to a Kimber TLEII abroad. So all these ''free custom'' features were well ''paid for''... ahhahahahahahahaha\n\nI don''t have much experience with this PT-1911, YET! Only 300 rounds through it. No hiccups so far. I''ve got my fingers crossed. ;) Will soon begin tweaking and customizing this baby once I get some time off from my Ph.

I still think I need to get these things tweaked in a PT-1911 cuz at the end of the day, it is a cheap model. I don''t know many gunsmiths around here who can do this and how much would it cost really... but my estimate is that putting in another 100$ should do the job for me.

Everyone is right at his/her place. The disagreements and differences in states of minds and lifestyles is what makes this life worth living. I totally understand that not every one is willing to dedicate his/her precious time to a 1911 and bond with it philosophically and intellectually. And that is well appreciated by all means.\n\nNow about the particular 1911 in case. I would definitely agree with you brother. In the realistic situation in Pakistan, I think there are better choices than a PT-1911. I have said numerous times that a Walther P99 is on my list next and I believe it can be had for around 60k (last time i checked) and is a reliable gun right out of the box, the kind you can bet your life on. So are the CZs. Given our circumstances, it would be sheer pigheadedness and unrealistic tunneled vision approach to disagree with you on that point. \n\nThe question remains: why did I then not go for a Walther for that matter? The ONLY reason I still chose a cheap 1911 over a better out of the box option was MY level of familiarity with the system, its ergonomics as it fits my hands and its crisp trigger pull that I am able to bet my life on. Simple.\n\nThank you AK bhai for your input and this engagement in intellect.

(342703, 'Turkish 14 shot dual mag pump action 12G Turkish firm UTAS has brought dual magazine pump-action shotgun to market.\r\n\r\nPhotos:  [url]http://utasturk.com/products/tactial-shotguns/uts-15-pictures/category/1.html[/url]\r\nSpecs:    [url]http://utasturk.com/products/tactial-shotguns/uts-15-specifications.html[/url]\r\n\r\nEach of the UTS-15 magazines hold 7 rounds of 2.75" sized shot shells (it can also chamber 3" shells), giving it a 14+1 capacity. A selector allows the operator to select which magazine to feed or to automatically alternate between the magazines.\r\n\r\nThe body of the gun is made from carbon fiber to save weight. The lower receiver has a built-in button operated laser and light. It also comes with iron sights mounted on the full length picatinny rail.\r\n\r\nThe first modern combat shotgun was the Model 97 Winchester pump-action shotgun issued to American troops during WWI. The first combat shotgun was developed by modifying a sporting shotgun from the Winchester commercial product line by cutting the barrel length back to 18,” extending the magazine tube to hold a total of 7 rounds and adding a sheet metal heat deflector on top of the barrel and an attachment to accept a bayonet. From this first combat shotgun to the current generation of combat shotguns used by police and military, there have been no significant improvements to the basic design. That is until the development of the UTS-15 urban tactical shotgun.\r\n\r\nClick here to viewThe current combat shotguns on the market have limitations and design issues that needed to be addressed. Specifically, all of the combat shotguns currently in service carry only 7 or 8 rounds housed in a magazine tube running the full-length under the barrel. This magazine design requires cartridges to be loaded manually and thus slowly one shell at a time. Furthermore, the conventional shotgun design with its long magazine tube dictates a substantial overall length which cannot be further shortened without sacrificing magazine capacity. Consequently, the current generation of combat shotguns are too long and awkward, have insufficient magazine capacity and are too slow to reload to function well in the close quarters, house-to-house fighting of the urban battlefield. In addition, within the urban environment for the military, police and home protection, most armed encounters occur at night when conventional sights are difficult if not impossible to use. Consequently, current combat shotguns all feature Picatenny rails for the mounting of flash lights or laser sights to aid sighting in night combat. \r\n\r\nThe UTS-15 addresses all of the shortcomings of the former and current combat shotguns by breaking away from the tradition shotgun paradigm. The UTS-15 is a totally new, patented firearms design that employs a revolutionary double magazine top-feed system and light weight carbon fiber and polymers construction. The end result is a combat shotgun that holds 15 rounds, is only 71 centimeters long, weighs approximately 3 kilos and has a built in point-and-shot spotlight and laser night sight. With compressible magazine springs and convenient top loading magazine ports the UTS-15 is also the fastest loading shotgun ever designed. The pump action design provides reliable cycling for all 2.75” and 3” 12 ga. shotgun loads, including low powered non-lethal and crowd control ammunition. In crowd control application the menacing profile of the UTS-15 provides an additional intimidation factor during initial confrontation. In police application the UTS-15 is short enough to be easily manipulated inside a police cruiser and brought into action as fast as a handgun. For military applications the UTS-15 with its built in laser sight and point-and-shoot spotlight sight can be quickly and accurately employed for door breaching and room clearing inside any building. For home defense the UTS-15 is simple to use and lightweight enough to be quickly brought to bear by any member of the family in an emergency situation. The UTS-15 is not only faster, lighter and easier to use than any other combat shotgun the ultra simple design allows the gun to be field stripped in approximately 45 seconds with no special training and without the use of tools. \r\n\r\nClick here to viewTo compare the UTS-15 to the current offering of combat shotguns, a major source for weapons information around the world has been Janes publications. Janes.com has an interesting section on military shotguns. It is stated there that in 1999, the US army announced plans to obsolete the Mossberg 590A1 and the Winchester Model 1200 pump action shotguns with the Benelli XM 1014 autoloader 12 gauge known as the M4 Super 90. Between 1999 and 2005, the army placed orders for nearly 25,000 units. Of late, Janes reports that the Army has expressed concerns over unreliable cycling of these autoloading shotguns particularly when used with low pressure specialty loads such as non lethal shells. Janes doubts that the US Army conversion from pump action to auto-loading shotguns will be completed and that the Army is likely to stay with pump action guns. \r\n\r\nJanes reports that the Marine Corps placed an order in April of 2008 for 500 units of Benelli M4. The current price of the Benelli M4 Tactical shotgun listed at [url]www.benelliusa.com[/url] starts at $1,799. The M4 has far fewer value features than the UTS15. Benelli also sells the M2 Tactical at $1,219 and the M3 tactical at $1,549. The later two models are converted from sporting editions of their pump action line. 2. Mossberg makes a low price line of tactical shotguns. They also make a range of tactical shotguns running from about $1800 to $2400 and the Mossberg Persuader for $1,712. 3. Remington recently sold the US military 1,400 of their "gun in a bag" Model 870 riot gun for a reported $1,214 each. 4. FN (Herstal) sells their converted sporting 12 gauge as the Model SLP for $1,000. This can be found on the FNH website or on gilbertsguns.com. \r\n\r\nClick here to viewIn summary of the comparable price valuation, the UTS15 is a unique offering in the market. When compared to similar products from major world manufacturers such as Benelli, Remington, FN and Mossberg, the UTS15 offers far superior product features and performance capabilities at or below the cost of similar products. However, in reality the value is much greater because the UTS-15 merely represents the first product of a whole family of small arms built on the basic UTS (Urban Tactical Systems) design platform. \r\n\r\nThe UTS dual magazine top-feed platform can be easily scaled up to 40mm to make a 10-shot 40mm grenade launcher, with quick detachable and disposable magazine tubes and a built-in laser rangefinder coupled with a range compensating sight. The initial study of the UTS-40 concept is complete and the conclusion is that it would bring to the battlefield a new effective combat weapon that would likely replace most of the currently employed shoulder fired 40mm weapons. The only multi-shot 40mm is the South African designed MGL which holds only 6 rounds and is very bulky and heavy. \r\n\r\nThere are a variety of 40mm weapons being produced by a number of companies and utilized by any number of military forces, but all of them except for the MGL are single-shots. Consequently, a 40mm shoulder fired weapon that was fast loading, easy to use and light weight would quickly find a ready market with most modern armies and could well make a great impact on battlefield tactics now and in the future. Of course if the UTS platform can be scaled up it can also be scaled down. \r\n\r\nThe heart of the UTS platform is its dual magazine feeding system that uses the rim of the shell to alternate feeding from one magazine to the other. Consequently, any straight case rimed cartridge that lends it’s self to tub magazine loading will work well in the UTS system. So, another family of firearms that could spawn from the UTS design could be small compact sub-machineguns in such caliber as .44 Magnum or .50 S&W or any number of calibers. \r\n\r\nThe civilian home defense market for combat shotguns in the United States is growing, but the exact number of this type of shotgun sold each year is not broken out in Government records. However, in 2008 (the most recent figures available), there were 752,857 shotguns manufactured in the US. Of this number, 41,270 were exported. On March 2nd a meeting was held with Mossberg to discuss the potential of the UTS-15; Mossberg is the biggest producer of military and police combat shotguns in the World with production of about 250,000 per year servicing the U.S. military, law enforcement and civilian markets, so they have a better idea of the market demand for the UTS-15 than about anyone we could talk to. The Vice President and Director of Marketing stated that with the all-out marketing effort they would expected sales figures the first year to be between 30 and 50 thousand units depending on the MSRP price level. \r\n\r\nThe UTS15 is easy in penetrating the Police and Military market. It is a unique state-of-the-art weapon system with no immediate comparable and whilst it stands no threat of being replicated or remotely copied, its valuation is assessed far more easily and realistically. The sale price has been identified and calculated for military purchases. The identification arises from observing all current and previous pump action shot-guns both similar and dissimilar in configuration, specification, performance and characteristic across military and private sector markets, to clearly understand and value the pump action UTS-15. \r\n\r\nThe first modern combat shotgun was the Model 97 Winchester pump-action shotgun issued to American troops during WWI.

I told this to a friend of mine and he was like "what? really?" lol[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, kindly allow me to give my humble opinion on the subject. a 2011 corolla''s engine is just another evolution of the 1970''s corolla (read: rust bucket). now does that it mean you go and trade in your new corolla with an old rust bucket?\r\n\r\nMy point is quiet simple. 1911 is one of hell of a design. not doubt about that. it was way ahead of its time. but dude its not 1911 anymore. this is 2011. one must understand and recognize the technological and engineering advancements that have been made over the years. when 1911 was designed, the engineering sciences were at their infacy. it is after the WW2 that engineering grew exponentially. infact there is a scientic law at work here. the more science progresses, it increases the speed of further progression. similary, as science progress, more and more discoveries are made at a much rapid speed.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=cyanide.dipped;181374]So what makes a 1911 more desirable than any other handgun out there? For me, its the soul. It is the individual personality of each of the 1911, and the extra amount of care that it needs more than any other gun that makes it desirable for me. Its like saying that my 1911 is MY 1911. I have tweaked it, customized it to my preferences and it aint some gun you can just pick up off a counter. My 1911 is MY 1911. It aint A GLOCK 17, which are all the same. When you put so much time cleaning, customizing and training with your 1911, it truly becomes an extension of your psyche. Thats what I dig.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nabolutey agreed. when you''re right, you''re right.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=cyanide.dipped;181374]That said, the 1911 is NOT a gun for the casual user, or what we call NDP''s (non-dedicated personnel). The gun was designed when technology was expensive, but skilled labor was not. The exact opposite is true today. A carry 1911 should be gone over by an experienced specialist (Heinie, Burns, Yam, Yost, Garthwaite, etc) and then properly maintained by the end user. The average cop or typical CCW holder would be better served with a Glock or SIG in most cases. If you''re willing to spend the money to get a properly set up 1911 and TRAIN with it, then you''re not "average".[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nabsolutely agreed bro and it couldnt have been explained any better. what are you? YODA? :)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=cyanide.dipped;181374]Last year I took three classes as a student (Taylor, Gonzales, Suarez) and the year before one from Clint Smith. In each of those classes I fired about 800 rounds through my carry 1911 without cleaning it and with zero malfunctions. At the NTI last year, I dropped an impact target with about an eight inch square vital zone at approximately 80 yards, from an awkward position, with one shot from my carry 1911, while being filmed by a TV crew. The superb trigger on my gun made that a lot easier. Since I have a choice in my personal weapons, I choose to carry the system that stacks the odds in my favor.

I understand you cant compare it with modern gun but you can compare it with german luger, P38 etc , for me 1911 is just for collecting purpose unless you spent fortune on it which is not make any sense if you are a practical user instead of a collector or a diehard fan.

(342794, ' @ 12 Gauge\n\nIt is interesting how you try to counter my ''powerful'' words showing off your ''scientific'' vocabulary. I do love it when people do that ;) Its a nice means for a counter-attack to get the focus off the real issue. :)\n\nWhat interests me more is that you have chosen to answer my post selectively. Thats makes it easier for you to pick and choose things you wanna focus at, leaving the rest (context) in blurry background. But if you go back to my posts, you will find that the context I am placing my arguments is pretty self-explanatory, is inclusive of other''s POVs and is devoid of any disrespect for others ways of life.\n\n"Bro, hand-made blue prints are extinct now. these day its the CAD/CAM we are talking about. so, to answer you on that part, NO! they do not remain the same. bro, any mechanical design is based around prevailing limitations in engineering, design and fabrication abilities/standards. therefore a 100 year old design can never compete with todays design in terms of engineering advancements. Me being a graduate in Fabrication and NDT (Non-Destructive-Testing) would discuss fabrication details with my dad who was also in the same field and most of the time, it was Wow! Things have really changed. I&#8217;m not talking 100 years, I&#8217;m only talking about changes in the last 5 years. "\n\nBro you are beating about the bush a lil bit. A design made utilizing CAD/CAM IS a handmade blueprint. You are not suggesting that you are using advanced AI to draw designs for you in these software by reading your mind. YOU are the one drawing stuff in CAD just as it is a human hand animating a rigged biped in Houdini for that matter. And if you talk about automations, these are scripted actions too, based on human commands. Thats the kinda blueprint I am talking about. Of course in many fields there are drastic changes every year, but we all generally agree that in pure sciences, 60/70 years ago is considered ''recent''. The ''basics'' remain the same unless these are revolutionized. Thats my point. Simple and non-offensive.\n\n"my point exactly. its a outdated design to begin with and any improvements would on it would only be cosmetic at best. nothing revolutionary or evolutionary. so its pointless to insist that a 1911 would live another 100 years."\n\nFirst of all, would you be kind enough brother to point where I argued that 1911 would live another 100 years? I would be highly amused if you could lol :) I believe handguns themselves would be outdated within the next 100 yrs. Thats just me though ;)\n\nSecondly, thank you for agreeing on my point. So it is settled that so called ''modern improvements'' on John Browning''s design are simply cosmetic... the Glocks and the rest have not really revolutionized or added anything to the basics of that design. Done ;)\n\n"does this even mean anything? you are probably trying to say that a proton generated beam passing through an active plasma ray of gamma discharged (re-activated) electromagnetic field not would yield enough power? Come on! Who are you kidding?"\n\nActually that was a direct answer to your argument that since science has advanced so much in a hundred years, 1911s are ''outdated'' and rendered ineffective. Just cuz science has advanced in these 100 years, doesnt mean everything has been rendered irrelevant. And I showed you, through my direct analogy, that your line of thinking would then render all handguns currently in use as ''outdated'', simply because science has advanced so much in these 100 yrs and can harness the energy inherent in a laser beam and an atom that there is no point then hitting brass primers from a handheld steel/plastic frame.\n\n"so, are you saying that multi-axis CNC machines as compared to old lathe milling machines do not exist? Bro. are you saying the EDM machining as compared to old carbite cutter machining does not exist? Bro, things have really changed. Therefore the mechanical designs of todays have really progressed from old hand made blue prints to highly complex CAD/CAM based designs."\n\nAh right. Things have changed. Its my turn to ask though, what does that mean exactly? And how is it relevant to our discussion at hand? And again, please reconsider your proposed dichotomy between a hand made design and an CAD design. Both are still HANDMADE at the end of the day. Only tools have changed. As in paper+pencil vs CAD cyberspace.\n\nNow interestingly your analogy above only serves to highlight my original argument. Has anything changed in the basic lathe principals over the years? Without using the fancy engineering terms, the main difference between a lathe and a mill is that on a lathe, the work turns and the cutting tool is stationary, while on a mill, the tool turns and the work is stationary. And vertical or horizontal, manually operated or through computer numerical control, it stays the same. Yet it is definitely an evolution. Where is the evolution in the ''modern gun design''? Show me one ''evolutionary'' change from 1911 to any of the ''modern plastic guns'' and i''d be happy to give an ovation. Basics = same; basic design = same; some cosmetic changes = sure; whats the point here?\n\n"Seriously? No way dude! Does this sentence even mean anything? But I do like the powerful words though however I do not see any logic forming anywhere."\n\n''Does that mean anything'' seems to be your mannerism. :)\n\nI have gone and explained that ''time lapse module'' again in this post as irrelevant unless directly in contradiction to any of my arguments. If it still doesn''t mean anything, then lets say it doesn''t, for you. No problem.\n\nI like how you try to label my words ''powerful'' in order to try to evade the argument... but THAT, brother, actually means nothing. Powerful or not, there were not counter-arguments in this sentence of yours. And BTW, accusing someone of meaningless babble is rude brother. ;) \n\n"Kindly read this sentence really slow. Then tell me why are tall trees tall? Lemme answer that for you. A tall tree is tall because it is tall. Hahahah! another case of Ill-logical sentence."\n\nOh man, should I even begin talking about logic 101? It is hilarious how you attempt to insult without any scholarly background in logic. But nevermind. :)\n\n"Kindly elaborate the electromagnetic energy triggered by the human retina. I&#8217;m sure you are not talking about the electrochemical something something which is not triggered by the retina why because&#8230;&#8230; human retina isn&#8217;t a &#8230;&#8230;."\n\nOh no I am talking about the Yoda something something laser beam something something technology that everyone of us should possess today just cuz its been a 100 years since 1911 design was conceived something something....\n\n"You are absolutely right Bro. I have seen some wild case presentations but this one is totally unique. ;)"\n\nI wouldnt drop to that level of immaturity and say that your reply was simple babble and labeling and nothing else. I respect your viewpoint, the respect I suspect you lack for me. But thats alright. I am not looking for any. ;)\n\nMy argument was never with you from the beginning brother. To your intellect is your opinion, to mine is mine. I agree on disagreement. Life goes on. No need to tauntingly and insultingly call my case ''unique'' if you didn''t like it ;) Cool down brother, chill out... its just a discussion.\n\nIt endeth here. I won''t engage any further with you in this particular matter. :thumbsup: :rockon:', ''),

(342909, ' [B]225 Winchester[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 225 Winchester was officially announced in June 1964, but production rifles and ammunition were not actually available until some months later. Both the standard and heavier-barreled varmint version of the Model 70 bolt action were offered for this round. The 225 replaced the older 220 Swift in the Winchester lineup. It is a semi-rimmed case,  but with an unusually large rim for this type of cartridge so that on casual inspection, it appears to be a normal rimmed case. The 220 Swift never achieved great popularity and neither did its replacement, the 225. The last Winchester catalog to list the cartridge as a caliber available for the Model 70 rifle was in 1972. No other manufacturer picked it up as a standard chambering because the already popular 22-250 was standardized by Remington less than a year later, and it was just common sense to adopt it instead. Winchester still loads 225 ammunition and probably will at least for a few more years, but this cartridge did not have a very long life, being semi-obsolete in only few years.\r\nAlthough the 225 is a fine varmint cartridge with performance similar to the 224 Weatherby or the 22-250, there simply isn''t a market for three cartridges that all offer pretty much same thing. The 22-250 was already established as a popular wildcat with an outstanding reputation, and it was inevitable that it would dominate the field. Those who purchased 225 Winchester rifles have no need to feel bad or trade them off for anything else because the 225 cartridge is just as accurate and will do anything that the more popular 22-250 will do. The 225 has an edge over both the 222 and the 223 Remington for long-range varmint shooting because of the increased muzzle velocity. At one time, Winchester was supposed to furnish a 50-grain loading at 3800 fps and a 60-grain at 3500 fps, along with the standard 55-grain at 3650 fps, but this never materialized.', ''),

Also, time lapse module in the cognitive paradigm? Simple jack s cognition is stumped.\nViva la 1911! :d[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Starfish Bhai,\n\nMy pleasure. As I understand, you have already googled the term. As to what it applied to in my post, I would like to draw your kind attention to the post of Mr. 12 Gauge to which my post was an answer. \n\n[QUOTE]\ninfact there is a scientic law at work here. the more science progresses, it increases the speed of further progression. similary, as science progress, more and more discoveries are made at a much rapid speed. [/QUOTE]\n\nSee this statement actually is an argumentum verecundiam, or ipse dixit. The appeal here is to a false authority, since no lexicon or reference is cited to render the statement as valid. I simply hinted at the fact that saying that scientific progression increases the speed of further progression, HENCE, it is true that 1911s are obsolete is sheer absurdity of an argument and a logical fallacy.\n\nThe term, ''cognitive paradigm'', for the sake of simplest explanation, means the intellectual understanding of a given frame of expression. For example, if we are talking about taboo, the cognitive paradigm would be the society and the social dynamics. It is the PLACEMENT of the INTELLECT in a given REFERENCE of THOUGHT PROCESSES and CONSTRUCTED IDEAS. However, to understand the term fully, one can spend countless hours studying different sources. Wikipedia lists some very rudimentary explanations for the keyword ''cognition'', which could be a good starting point. However, let me stress here the incompetency of freely available sources for scholarly and deeply intellectual understanding. The most reliable sources are exclusive and can only be accessed through a properly academic channel in a library of your own choice.\n\nHowever, to make it really really simple, the cognitive paradigm is simply the context of placed understanding. The time-shift module is an age-old trick of logic which works within its cognitive paradigm, ie, the time itself. The trick is, you take any idea, any invention, anything at all, place it IN THE TIME, which would AUTOMATICALLY place it in the time-lapse module, ie that time has passed since its inception/creation/invention, and if you don''t like it just say that BECAUSE time has passed since its inception, this idea/invention/design etc is irrelevant in current times.\n\nYou get the point dear brother? Let us take a simple example of ethics. How many times have we heard utilitarian people say that ethics are irrelevant in the current era? Jokingly maybe, still the argument was at least very fashionable some while ago. Because the time has passed since it was considered that it is necessary to keep a promise, hence it is irrelevant weather you keep it or not in today''s life, as the ''advancements'' have been so mammoth that the result-oriented approach would not take into consideration the ethical implications of any sort but the outcome in your favor.\n\nAnother example: Since X amount of time has passes on so and so religious scripture; hence it is irrelevant today and not equipped well to cater to today''s advancements and changes. An extremely common argument of the Atheists.\n\nThe point here is: the ''time-shift module'' is irrelevant to any given cognitive paradigm UNLESS in direct relation with the given premises from which the conclusion is drawn. Simply because something is old, does not AUTOMATICALLY mean that it has become "obsolete" "irrelevant" or "useless; Unless it is SHOWN and PROVEN with a RELEVANT argument why the invention/design/creation in point is ''obsolete'' or ''useless'' today, the time-shift module application means absolutely nothing.\n\nFollowing from the above, to say that 1911 is an old design, and since a lot of time has passed since its inception, is irrelevant to the assertion that it has become ''obsolete''.\n\nAll this very simply put, and you brother correctly and intelligently got the gist right, saying that 1911 is an old design means nothing for the concept of handgun itself is an old concept and there hasn''t been a ''radical'' change in this field since its original inception nor any revolution in comparison to which we can assert that 1911 design has become irrelevant. \n\nLike Mr. Abbas said in one of his posts, unless you change the basic projectile based design of a handgun, 1911 design would remain at the top of the list. I believe it was something to that affect.\n\nAnd my retina triggered electromagnetic field example was simply an added emphasis on the fact that by a time-shift module application thence we would need guns which could fire when we focus on a target with our eyes. Why? Cuz SO MUCH TIME HAS PASSED SINCE 1911 DESIGN AND SCIENCE HAS ADVANCED SO MUCH that it would be naive to still carry ANY handgun anymore for that matter. :)\n\nStarfish brother, simply put (God, I have said that a lot already :p) I am saying what you said in your post # 94. ;)\n\nThe bottom line is, if you like 1911s, you like em. If you don''t, you don''t. As far as practical application goes, if you can handle a little skilled labor, a constant care, a level of dedicated commitment, and can handle the weight and recoil, it is one of the most reliable guns ever built on planet earth. If not, it aint for you.\n\nWhen everything said and done, ''to every man his little cross, until he dies, and is forgotten''. I could care less if someone doesnt like 1911s. I''ve got better things to worry about in life than people who don''t like a supposedly ''old'' design of a gun. I was simply sharing my views as means of social interaction, mutual respect and sharing the knowledge and ideas. If that isn''t welcomed and poses a problem, nevermind. Like I said I have got so many better things to do. I am not here to be insulted ''repeatedly'' just because someone disagrees with my views.\n\nThankyou Starfish Brother for dwelling into my posts, appreciating my time and effort and respecting my viewpoint. I appreciate that as I appreciate YOUR time and effort in posing those questions for me. I am glad we met.\n\nWarmest regards,\nCD.\n\nP. S.: Viva La Estrellas :)', ''),

DCO entry is only when you buy you weapon this will also "registrater" the weapon number of yours with your Lic.\r\n \r\nSo step-by-step, Get your Lic in Hand, get it register with NBP, then go to your dealer and buy yourself a weapon and the along with the Purchase recipt it has to go to DCO office for Lic & Database entry.

(343083, ' ^ \n\n:)\n\nWell, the problem is this is the way I indulge in a discussion. I don''t know of any other way. Maybe its ''cuz I''ve been academically trained (cursed? lol) to approach a given problem with syntactical precisions and argumentative relevance. If "the unconscious is structured like a language" (Lacan, Jacques. &#8220;The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience&#8221;. Ecrits: A Selection. Trans. Alan Sheridan. Bristol, Great Britain: Tavistock, 1977. 01-07. Print.) then the kind of person someone is, his language would reflect the intellect and inner patterns of his personality. That cannot be changed. This is the reason, perhaps, I don''t have a social circle outside academics and even the one I have is limited. Most people cannot understand what I am sayin lol... and since I am involved in theatrical production most of my time, that requires a level of solitude for the creative process itself is nourished only through loneliness. \n\nHowever, thats besides the point. The point is the mutual respect. Even if someone cannot understand what I am saying, the respect should be there. For the value I teach my students and have been taught is that free speech is a basic right of every human being and EVERYONE''s POV, without discrimination, is as valid as the others. We should not get personal in discussions, should honor differences and should not let our egos get involved in the process. It is the humane way, it is the professional and mature way, and it is THE ONLY way. Free speech should not become hate speech and should reflect mutual respect for each other''s personalities and selves. \n\nComing to the point though... yes, the extractor on the gun is broken and it needs replacement. That has been established well by the senior members, however, it was a bit evident from the pics and the way the gun was handled (racked and fired, and then got jammed... on a 1911 it means either the magazine is faulty, or the extractor is broke) right from the beginning. Hopefully the esteemed owner can find a gunsmith and replacement parts to get hat fixed. My best wishes :)\n\nThe hiccup could maybe avoided in future using only expensive foreign made FMJs only. Most of these problems occur (as it is common knowledge amongst 1911 users) by using faulty ammo. However, if the barrel bushing is adjusted and the extracter tweaked, it can also feed low quality ammo well, and also the JHPs (HPs are still a no no).\n\nThankyou starfish brother for your time.

Regarding the barrel bushing adjustment and extractor tweak; can you please explain HOW TO part of it? but in very simple English please ;) many members like me are very weak hearted & on medication ;)[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nFirst of all Denovo Bro, lol at your heart condition :) Point well taken ;)\r\n\r\nThe barrel bushing should be a tight fit and should resist movement by hand, as is said by Kuhnausen in his great Shop Manual. The tighter and more accurate the bushing is, the better the barrel would fit the slide:\r\n\r\n"If properly sized, a tightened accuracy bushing should fit into its'' individual slide to a light, or moderate drag fit. Generally, these bushings can not be turned with fingers, particularly when the slide is closed and the barrel is in the locked position."\r\n\r\nIt is a pre-series 70 feature that comes in many contemporary 1911s as an added feature. PT-1911 has an accuracy bushing installed by default. If not so, you will need a gun smith with proper tools to tweak it, and adjust it, so it properly fits.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that the accuracy bushing can only increase the reliability if the feed ramp and the barrel ramp are in perfect position, and the barrel ramp doesnt overhang. If there''s an inconsistency there, no matter what other tweaks you do, your gun would not feed reliably. But this is a rare problem in 1911s and MOST recently built 1911s do not have a problem in this area. This is the reason I didnt mention it in the post you referred to. So generally only fitting the barrel bushing better, the feeding problems can be corrected because the barrel would sit better in the slide after a discharge and the next bullet can be then chambered without any problems.\r\n\r\nThe extractor should have enough tension (between half a pound to a pound and a half) to push the spent cartridge up in the place. You can judge that by basic disassembly, and then without the slide stripped pushing the cartridge in. You can see if when you push the cartridge in if the extractor moves enough to the right (15 to 20 thousands of an inch). And as you push the bullet into the position, as it passes the center of the extractor, it should move a bit back (only a couple of thousands of an inch) to ensure that the cartridge does not come back down. If you don''t have that amount of tension, the problems, similar to the reported one in this thread, in extraction would occur. You can correct this very easily by inserting the extractor halfway into the slide and bending it a little to create the right amount of tension. (obviously you will have to be careful to not to bend it too much though).\r\n\r\nAlso, another common problem is loose breach. It can cause grave damage if not checked and remedied properly before extended usage of the gun. Fortunately it is rare in quality 1911s recently manufactured too and is very easy to check. With a 1911 disassembled, put the barrel in the slide, lock it by pullin it back and pushing it up, put the barrel bushing in and then push n pull the slide back and forth to see if you have any ''play''. Any motion while the barrel is in locked position is simply devastating cuz it creates dangerous gap between the surfaces of the slide and the barrel in the locking system area and your slide and barrel can both be destroyed easily while firing which can EVEN cause death to the shooter. So please be very careful about this one especially cuz many of the 1911 users don''t know anything about this problem. But like I said, the saving grace is that this is an EXTREMELY rare problem in 1911s produced after the 80s, and can easily be checked. PT-1911 rarely has this kinda problem.\r\n\r\n1911 design is not perfect by any means. However, the thing I like about it that if there is ANY, and I mean ANY problem, it can be taken care of. It is like Harley Davidson vs Ducati (and I have had my time with both of the bikes) where you can customize and correct any problems in HD but not so much so with a Ducati and most of the time it needs replacement of parts or even a complete factory overhaul if something malfunctions. I have disassembled a Glock many times and I can see in its design there is absolutely no room for customization or ''correction''. That is the reason why my ''homies'' were running up and down the street to the Glock dealer back in the good old days to get their guns replaced every time one of these went boom on them. lol... never seen a ''true'' 1911 user going ''oh... never thought this could happen'' with his 1911. HAHAHAHAHAHA\r\n\r\nHope this helps with your ''heart condition'' brother. lolx2 ;)\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nCD.\r\n\r\nP.S.: +1 for the ammo. However, I have seen some of the people in villages acquiring cheap ammo from darra. I don''t know if those forty-fives were also foreign and they got them for a bargain price or not. But I suspected these were locally manufactured or ''refilled''. :)', ''),

(343204, ' ^\n\n+1 Denovo bhai... I think the only way you should carry a 1911 is in condition one... mainly ''cuz of its external thumb safety. Pistols like Glocks etc don''t have these so this extra step in drawing and presentation is reduced there. In 1911, while presenting, you have to manually remove the thumb safety which is an added step. So if you carry it in any other condition the draw time is increased. The rule of thumb is, you should be able to draw a gun and fire at least two rounds at the center of the mass if you are presented with a threat to successfully defend yourself. ;)', ''),

His arrogance, irascibility and misogynistic (terms you would find on the internet, although I believe his arrogance is so overwhelming that it renders his other ''qualities'' almost unnoticeable) personality asserts that the quality of pronunciation, tone and enunciation defines somebody''s status and class in society. The play is obviously written in the backdrop of the class struggle (cf. Marx and Angles) and the iconoclast Shaw was, is highly deductive in nature.\n\nI am neither arrogant nor irritated and definitely don''t have misogynistic tendencies. What I am saying has nothing do with class representation or being ''better'' than others if you have a better vocab. I am simply hinting at the fact that your language will reflect the kind of person you are, for the unconscious itself is structured like a language and hence the rendition of the signified along the vector of the chain of the signifier.\n\nSimply put, the way you have been brought up, the way you have been taught, and the way you are, will reflect in the words that you choose to communicate. Simple as that. It doesn''t mean that you are better than others if you are speaking better than others. ;)\n\nRegards,\nCD.', ''),

This belief is a by product of some thing I extracted out of existentialism , that without appealing to a common man, your academics are restricted to your lounge chair and your cigar :)\n\nBut you sir, sit on the highest chair of implementation of your knowledge.

Existentialism is a philosophy and is by no means restricted to academia alone. The only problem is, how many of us have even tried reading "being and nothingness"? You can only understand what you TRY to. If a common man has no time to try and invest in understanding of a certain philosophy, who is to blame?

I think the SS AR model is for 690$ though... so I got myself an even better deal :-D :)\n\nI have posted a review as an article here: [url]http://www.pakguns.com/content.php?236-Taurus-PT-1911[/url]\n\nI don''t know if that''d be published or what is the modus operandi for it to be featured as an article on the site.

(343248, ' [QUOTE=cyanide.dipped;181995]^\n\nBro, can you carry 100 bullets or BUY 100 bullets at one time? Last time I checked, you could BUY 100 bullets in a given time period and can CARRY only 25 as per our laws. Additional carry permits are issued if required. If its different in your licence, plz let me know who to acquire the kind of licence that you have :)\n\nAnd bro you can carry that coffin clip with some practice and a customized belt which has a horizontal clip holster ;)[/QUOTE]\n\nYou have very [B]basic/primitive[/B] type license CD bro ;) you even can get your license stamped with permission to buy/carry unlimited count of rounds, an MOI license comes with 100 rounds allowance to buy and carry by default.', ''),
