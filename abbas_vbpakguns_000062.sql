I told him that it will cost 5000/rs for prototyping x5 pieces and then upon approval it will cost about 3800/rs per part COMPLETE.  He balked at the price stating that he could get the same thing from abroad for 1500/rs.  Lolz, I said ok, lemme talk to my guy again.  I did and he stated this:  Moeen bhai, 150 piece kia hai, mera time zia karna hai na.  Give me an order for 1000 pieces and I will give you each part for 800/rs!  or if you can wait and afford diecasting then I can give you on an order of 2000 pieces a rate of 500/rs each!  This is how it all works whether here or abroad.  So expect to pay higher prices as I don''t expect 1000+ customers per part... but atleast you can get the parts.  I will also be unloading the originals once the parts are made up to par of international standards.  There is no difference in the steel or alloy used there or here if one sticks to the proper international standards.  A billet of 7075 alloy untreated T6 out of Karachi costs about 9000/rs!  And its dimensions are 12"x2"x8", that was two years ago, dunno what it is now but I am sure its higher and not lower.\nWhat happens here is people tend to lower the price because of local manufacture and hence cause their own demise at the hands of sub standard parts.

The two legs can be extended from 6 inches to 10. On one of the international gun forums, I saw this guy who had installed a bipod with Uncle Mikes&#8217; kit through drilling a hole in the frontend of the fore grip. I didn&#8217;t want to make any alterations to the gun so instead of drilling a hole, I just replaced the front screw (which was about half inch long) with a screw bolt (measuring 2 inches in length and of same gauge). I placed rubber padding in between the bipod and the wood so that the finishing is not ruined in any way. The challenging part of installing this bipod was that the lower portion of the bipod had groves which would get tightened before the 2 inch long screw could reach the base and that resulted in a slight PLAY. I had to use a file to remove the grooves from the lower end of the screw bolt so that the only tightening takes place where it&#8217;s actually needed. \n\nThe results are as following: \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19958[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19959[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19960[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19961[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19962[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19963[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19964[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19965[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]19966[/ATTACH]\n\nI will be taking it to the range tomorrow, inshAllah; lets see what it has to say to a piece of paper :D.', 1, 0, '182.185.72.10', 0, 1, 9, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

On most firearms-related websites, advertisements, TV show and movies, shooters are shown using a two-handed grip. Thumb position and stance may vary, but*the general message is clear: two-handed is the &#8220;best,&#8221; the only &#8220;proper&#8221; way to shoot a pistol. Maybe so. For target shooting or competition, two-handed shooting works just fine. If it wasn&#8217;t optimal for gun control, no one would shoot two-handed at the range. In its 2003 Combat Pistol Manual, the US Army recommends two-handed shooting for engaging an enemy at less than five yards and for night firing . . .\nUsing a two-hand grip, the firer brings the weapon up close to the body until it reaches chin level. He then thrusts it forward until both arms are straight. The arms and body form a triangle, which can be aimed as a unit. In thrusting the weapon forward, the firer can imagine that there is a box between him and the enemy, and he is thrusting the weapon into the box. The trigger is smoothly squeezed to the rear as the elbows straighten.\nThere is no proof of the general advantage of two-handed shooting in close quarters defensive shooting situations. Common sense suggests the opposite: a shooter may not be able to extend both of his or her arms far enough forward to shoot two-handed in a close-quarters life-threatening situation.\nFrom 1854 &#8211; 1979, two-hundred-and-fifty NYPD police officers were killed in the line of duty. Of these, only one officer was killed at a distance beyond 25 feet&#8212;by a sniper 125 feet away. Ninety-two percent of the fatal confrontations occurred within*15 feet. Ninety-six-point-four percent went down under 25 feet.\n*\nDistance equals time, or lack thereof. If you don&#8217;t have the distance/time to assume a &#8220;proper&#8221; combat stance and grip, you won&#8217;t do it. The New York Police Department&#8217;s long-term study of thousands of police combat cases confirms it: most officers engaged in an armed confrontation fired with their strong hand. This YouTube video demonstrates the point:\n\nThe two-handed grip is useful and accurate in non-combat situations. It may be the preferred method for shooting in combat. But real life says that most shooters in close-quarters life-threatening situations &#8220;revert&#8221; to a one-handed grip. *Not recognizing that fact for training and, thus, reality, could cost you your life.\nAs good as it gets\nI want to be clear. There is nothing wrong with using the two-handed grip in combat*per se. The pics below were scraped from a video of a robbery in Florida. They show a guard using a two-handed grip while moving and shooting and killing an armed robber.*In the first two images, we see that the guard appear (bottom of the screen), acquire his gun and move to confront the robber.\n\n\nWhen the robber points his gun at the guard one-handed, the robber is shot, falls down, and dies on the floor.\n\n\nEven though the guard&#8217;s grip is &#8220;correct,&#8221; note that his gun is not at eye level, he&#8217;s not using the sights, and his thumbs are pointing up, not forward along the frame (as recommended by my firearms instructors).\nAlso, though the guard was brave and the stakes could not have been higher, note that he was attacking and not reacting to a life threat. Forget CSI and all the other cop shows with official firearms advisors and endless retakes. In the real world, this is about as good as it gets, most of the time.\nSights Unseen\nMany of the pictures on websites show handgun shooting at distances that would make a sniper proud. If there are photos of targets, they show nice tight little groups.*Getting good groups at longer ranges is good for target shooting, competitions and showing your friends. But that kind of pistol shooting has little to do with the reality of or the danger of close-quarters life-threatening situations.\nThat&#8217;s because sight shooting is best used for distance shooting. While it&#8217;s good to be able to hit distant targets, again, studies show that &#8220;sight shooting&#8221; won&#8217;t or can&#8217;t be used in close-quarters life threatening situations. Here&#8217;s what L.W. Seecamp, a gunmaker that makes small pistols without sights, says about distance shooting:\nThe ability to shoot targets at 25 yards using sights sadly seems to provide little or no advantage in close combat . . .\nThe 25 yard shooting proficiency test for carry qualification required by many issuing authorities is absurd. It&#8217;s a request to perform a feat that would land you in jail if you ever tried to perform it &#8216;in self-defense.&#8217;\nIt&#8217;s like passing a driver&#8217;s test that requires you to slalom between traffic cones at 120 miles an hour. Seventy-five feet shooting proficiency is not too much to ask from a police officer who may be firing at a barricaded target, as the ability to drive at high speeds is not too much to ask from a Trooper pursuing a fleeing vehicle, but it&#8217;s ridiculous to ask it of civilians.\nShoot an &#8216;assailant&#8217; at 75 feet. Then try to find a lawyer good enough to keep you out of prison.\nTo bring this closer to home (so to speak), if you are going to be attacked, the attacker will most likely not attack you from across the street. The attack will be up close and personal.*As for home defense, if you measure how big your rooms are, you will know the distances which you should train at the most.\nHere&#8217;s what the NRA says about self-defense shooting:\n. . . the ability to keep all shots on a standard 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch sheet of paper at seven yards, hitting in the center of exposed mass, is sufficient for most defensive purposes.\nHere is a pic of a target that closely represents one in the NRA&#8217;s Guide To The Basics Of Personal Protection In The Home that was published in 2000.\n\nIf you have a gun for self-defense, you should know how to operate it and shoot it safely. Most importantly, you should be able to shoot it effectively one-handed, without the use of the sights.*To not master this skill could be the biggest&#8212;and last&#8212;mistake of your life.\nThere are plenty of so-called Point Shooting methods that can be used for effective close-quarters combat. There is the method developed by Fairbairn, Sykes, and Applegate; Quick Kill, and the one I favor, AIMED Point Shooting or P&S.', 1, 1, '113.203.162.48', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The one i sent u had the least effect as i tried rectifying the root cause in it (rather did it for once )  but i think the jerks in transportation has put it back to its original state \n\n[U]Why[/U] \n\nin these scopes there is an internal tube ... on two sides it is controlled by horizontal and vertical screws while from the opposite direction there is a metallic strip acting as a spring or counter-force ... open the front cover and remove lens now look into it you''ll understand the description given ... if the screws are not tightened adequately the strip doesn''t give enough pressure and then the internal tube slips on it every now and then\n\n[U]Questions[/U] :\n-- yes zeroing means that screws are at a fixed position but that can be done, without compromising zeroing but by adding shims to rear mount .. explained ahead \n--- you''ll know when the pressure applied by screws is enough they will be more tough while turning clock-wise\n\n[U]remedy [/U]\n\n-- earlier i used a few tools and increased tension of the metallic strip (it was placed as such that the tension was increased i guess it  has lost that position ) without taking it out .. a tricky process not advised as u might damage tube\n-- use shims to elevate rear of scope .. very easy \n\n[U]Using shims [/U]\n\n[U]Logic[/U] : the shim underneath the scope in rear mount will raise it from rear ... making its point of focus lower on the ground .. turning the elevation screw clock wise, will bring it to zero position but this time it will put more pressure on metallic strip as well (as compared to no shim)  and your scope will not loose zeroing ...

No fire. I checked safety and again tried to fire but trigger was flail (loose), no fire yet. started thinking, what had happened, possibilities. Either something in trigger is broken, or its a trigger sear jam.\nI removed the pellet out of breach. Then removed the stock and scope to inspect the trigger. apparently everything was ok but a sear seemed to have jammed. I noticed pinkish brown factory grease too over it. I gave a flick to this sear with a small screw driver and gun fired. ( pellet was already removed so no damage to surroundings at least).\nI liberally washed this goo like thing from trigger sears as much as I could without opening the trigger assembly. Then wiped it and applied some gun oil over the sears. Fitted the gun again in the stock. Cocked, Loaded a pellet, fired, gun went smoothly as before.\nFired 6-7 more pellets, trigger jam did not happen again.\nSo, The Quattro Trigger of Hatsan does have quality control issues. Although not big ones, an experienced person can take care of these issues, but in the hands of a novice some accidents might happen.\nI will not recommend Hatsan for a beginner after this experience.\nAny moderately experienced air gunner can easily tackle such issues. and some one more experienced can de-assemble the trigger, polish the sears and issue will be resolved for sure. So not a big issue but for a beginner it could be dangerous.\nNow Hatsan 99 will stay home for 100 or so shots and if it goes smooth, only then it can go to the field again.\nApparently the problem seems to have gone.

As he needed to pick up something, I went for a little browse in the shops and behold I came across an NIB Piranha-F (same batch as Chief''s and Moeen bhai''s). This pistol is an amazing shooter and now that it is discontinued for a full steel version CZ SP01 lookalike version, finding an NIB was a done deal the moment I held it and had a good look. Moeen bhai rightly said that it is a rare find and as no more are coming to PK I shouldn''t miss on it if I have even a slightest doubts (that I didn''t). Having an empty licence in hand made it all too easy a decision.\n\nShe is in absolutely mint condition with not a single fault or even a minor scratch anywhere inside or out. Even frame to slide rail is scratchless. Trigger break is crisp and abs creep free! After 2 years of wanting and looking for one, I finally have her... as I''m also picking up a NIB CZ Tactical Sport, there were a few seconds of doubt on the TS but it was committed for (& backing out on a committed deal is downright rude & insulting) and furthermore it will be modified by the one and only Moeen bhai in upcoming months. He plans to outdo his previous customised LiteSpeed and Thunderbolt TS''s with this one.\n\nI also witnessed Moeen bhai''s skills on a particular item today that left me speechless! He''s not only Big and Sexy but a master guru when it comes to gunsmithing. I strongly believe that he''s a real treasure to PG community. I have yet to come across anyone who can think they way he does when it comes to guns and then successfully implement those ideas.\n\nHigh res pics of my new slick babe to follow soon.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33119[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33120[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33121[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33122[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]33123[/ATTACH]', 1, 1, '202.69.12.24', 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

There is always a difference of opinion but the things should be run in a smooth way otherwise this would cause entropy and nothing else.\n\nSide by side, we need to conserve our resources as well. This is a global issue. If we will try to culminate all the natural fauna at once then there would be a scarcity of the resources in the future. Again, Yes,  a good hunter is always a good conservator and he should be. \nWe need to educate our people and to regulate the things. Yes, if somebody has done something wrong, he should get educated and this can always be done by community awareness programs. This forum is an excellent podium for this purpose.\n\nIf somebody hunts and then eat the meat as a food, there should not be any problem in it. I could not find any difference in slaughtering of captivated animals and shooting/hunting of birds/animals. \nYes, the intent of hunting should be for food purpose and I believe that when hunters take a lot of risk and search bushes and marshes for their hunted bird/animal, they actually try to get the hunted one for food.

The Chinese Type 92 pistol is a guaranteed success---thanks to the sheer size of its customer base.\n\n[B]by Timothy Yan published in Handguns magazine [/B]\n\nOf all the modern handguns in the world, very little is known about the new Chinese QSZ 92. It is short for ''Qing-Bing-Shi, Shou-Quiang,Zi-dong, 1992-shi'' or ''Small Arms, Handgun, Automatic, Type 1992." This is the story of the Type 92, China''s polymer service pistol.\n\nWhen the US military adopted the Beretta 92SF in the mid-1980s, the Chinese military took notice. It too was looking for a modern design to replace its old service pistols.\n\nThe Chinese military standard-issue handguns at the time were the Type 51/54 copies of the Russian tokarev TT-33 in 7.62 x 25. High-ranking officers and non-combat personnel were given the Type 64 compact pistols, a modified copy of the Walther PPK. The Chinese Special Forces used the unique Type 67 sound-suppressed pistol. Both were chambered for the Type 64 7.62 x 17 round, a rimless and slightly hotter derivative of the .32 ACP.\n\nAll three of those pistols can trace their origins back to the 1930s but all were obsolete by the 1980s. \n\nThe research for the new Chinese military handgun began in 1987. Originally the 9mm version and the 5.8 mm. version were separate developments. One was led by Liu Ming of the Small Arms Research Institute 208 outside of Beijing, and the other was headed by Qing Shang Sheng from the Chang Feng Machinery Company, also known as the Arselnal 236.\n\nBoth teams were merged into one in 1994 when the project was formally designated as the QSZ-92 Handgun Development. The 9mm. model was completed in 1998. The 5.8 mm. caliber variant was finished in 2000. Cheng Feng machinery Company located in Chongqing, Sichuan province, manufactures all models of the Type 92 series. During the research phase, there were initial prototypes resembling a mix of Sig-Sauer and CZ with the common Browning-type tilt-barrel lock and in alloy frames. That comes as no surprise since both the Sig-Sauer P226 and CZ75 had been copied by NORINCO for export at the time. However, those European-esque prototypes didn''t last long. Once the new pistol project went into the development phase, a new polymer frame design was used. \n\nThe production models emply a polymer frame to reduce weight and increase durability. Itg also allows the grip to be formed more ergonomically to fit the average Asian''s hand size and shape.\n\nThe centerpiece of the Type 92 is actually a metal sub-frame that inserts into the polymer frame in a similar fashion as the Smith &Wesson M & P. Most of the components ---the trigger, hammer and safeties---are integrated into this metal subframe. The magazine release is reversible. \n\nThe standard sight is the three-dot type with luminescent inserts. The proprietary accessory-mounting rails can be modified with the optional bolt-on, low profile 1913 Picatinny rail adapter. The slide release is on the left side and also functions as the takedonw pin. \n\nThe firing mechanism consists of double-action trigger with an external hammer. The single-action trigger pull is rated 3.37 to 6.74 pounds. The double-action trigger pull is an atrociously heavy 14.6 pounds, like the Chinese Type 64 PPK clone. \n\nThe primary safety is the frame-mounted ambidextrous safety and decocker. The additional safety is the hammer block and the firing pin safety that lowers only when the trigger is pulled all the way back. The double-action trigger gives the Type 92 the second-strike ability and makes it safe to carry with a loaded chamber[/FONT]\n\n  \n  \n  [FONT=&amp]PAGE 2[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&amp]Comparing it to the Beretta M9, the QSZ-92 is seven ounces lighter and over an inch shorter. Both the width and height are a quarter inch less. The grip and controls are more ergonomic for a majority of hand sizes.\n\nThe Chinese Type 92 is actually more similar to the newer Beretta Styorm PX 4, which also sports a polymer frame. And like the PX4, the Type 92 uses a less common ROTATING-BARREL LOCKING MECHANISM (empahsis mine.---bloodysam), which the Chinese found to be superior to the Browning-style tilt-barrel lock.\n\nThe rotating-barrel lock was first patterned by US Army Major Elbert Searle in 1905 and actually went up against Browning''s design in the trials that eventually led to the selection of the 1911 by the United States. The short-recoil version of the rotating-barrel lock was developed in 1907 by Karel krnka, a retired captain of the Austro0Hungarian army with a long family tradition in firearms making.\n\nQSZ-92 9 mm.\n\nMost of the Type 92s that have been produced are the 9mm version, which marks China''s re-adoption of the 9 x 19 Luger cartridge. Due to early German military influence, China was actually one of the first countries to adapt the 9mm. round after World War I. It continued using it until the 1950s, when the Russian calibers replaced it.\n\nThe Chinese military required that the new 9mm. round would have to out-penetrate the old Tokarev 7.62 x 25. The new Chinese DAP92-9 -9mm. cartridge accomplished that by featuring a 124-grain FMJ with a hardened-steel penetrator and loaded to +P pressure. The velocity is 1,181 fps from the 4.33 inch barrel.\n\nThe DAP92-9 can penetrate 1.3 mm. of helmet steel plate and two inches of pine plank behind it as 50 meters. For sound-suppressed requirements, a 150-grain sub-sonic load at 1,050 fps velocity was developed. There''s also a 1,410 fps +P+ high-velocity load made for the PDW type gun.\n\nAs mentioned, the Type 92 is short recoil-operated with a rotating-barrel lock. the chrome-plated, hammer-forged barrel is built on imported Steyr-Mannlicher hammer-forging machinery. \n\nThe barrel sports a big cam lug that rotates the barrel by engaging an angled track in the barrel guide block. Eight small locking lugs on the barrel mate with locking recesses machined into the slide''s interior. The chamber is fully supported.\n\nThe magazine is a 15-round double-column with dual feed lips. A standard lanyard loop is on the left bottom rear of the grip. \n\nThe early production Type 92 lacks a loaded-chamber indicator. Its sights are also 2mm. lower, and the front sight is on the barrel bushing instead of the slide.\n\nThe Type 92 weighs 26.8 ounces with an empty magazine. The QSZ-92 is availabel for $270.00 in large military and law enforcement orders. It was also selected by the Bangladeshi military to replace its Type 54.\n\nQSZ-92 5.8 mm.\n\nThe 5.8mm. version is similar to the 9mm. version in most area. It chambers the DAP92-5.8 5.8 x 21 bottle[/FONT] [FONT=&amp]\nneck high-velocity cartridge. The round features a 46.5 grain FMJ projectile with a hardened steel penetrator and lead-plug composite core.\n\nThe muzzle velocity out of the 4.53-inch barrel is 1,575 fps. The round can penetrate 1.3 mm. of steel helmet steel and two inches of pine plank at 50 meters. That penetration capability increases to 100 meters when fired from a 9.84-inch barrel at 1,738 fps.\n\nThe other major area of difference from the 9mm. model is the locking mechanism. The QSZ-92 5.8mm. model uses retarded blowback operation. The 9mm model''s eight barrel locking lugs and the two locking cuts inside of the slide were ommitted in the 5.8mm. variant.\n\nThe difference between retarded blowback and the delayed blowback, such as the original Searle design, is a locked breech. The retarded blowback action on the Type 92 5.8mm. has an unlocked breech. After the round is fired, it uses the turning of the barrel to slow down the slide.\n\nThe 5.8 mm. feeds from a 20 round double-column, dual-feed magazine. It also has a rounded trigger guard and lacks the star motif on the grip. The 5.8mm. model is slightly lighter than the 9mm. version. The closest thing we have to the QSZ-92 5.8 mm. and the 5.8 x 21 ammo. is the FNH Five-seveN and its 5.7 x 28 cartridge.\n\nQWS-06 (Per magazine article, this pistol is the replacement for the Type 67 sound-suppressed pistol. It is said to be essentially the long-barrel variant of QSZ-92 5.8 model wityh some modifications and comes issued with a detachable titanium alloy sound suppressor. I will omit the rest of this section and continue on to the NP42.-bloodysam)\n\nNP42 and CF98 (page 4)\n\nBoth the NP42 and CF98 are export models of the QSZ-92 9mm. NP stands for Norinco Pistol and CF is short for ''Chang Feng,'' its manufacturer. The NP42 is made to tighter tolerances and uses a higher-grade barrel, but it''s also more expensive. Some of the early NP42s lack the accessory rail. The NP42 has a NORINCO logo on the grip instead of the star motif on the military model and on the CF98. \n\nThe CF98 and NP42 have the following enhancements compared to the military model: a larger ejector port; restyled hammer and firing pin safety; a buffer inside the collapsible recoil spring guide rod; and ejector-mounted loaderd-chamber indicater; and taller sights. (The last two features also found their way back into the main production lodel of the QSZ-92.)\n\nThere''s an addtional logn-barrel model with a 4.73-inch barrel that weights 1.1 ounces heavier. It features additional front serrations on the slide.\n\nThree additional magazines are available for the export models. The new 15-round double-column magazine has a single feed lip that''s commonly used by Western handguns. For the restricted markets, there are two new 10-round double-column magazines in either dual-or single-feed lips. Those new magazines also work in the QSZ-92 military model.\n\nSince the QSZ-92 will never be imported to the US all the hands-on feedback comes from Pakistan, where the imprted CF98 and NP42s have been hot sellers. (And for this report I give special thanks to Taimur Khan, a Pakistani gun enthusiast and proud owner of the CF 98.\n\nThe CF98 and NP42 can be purchased from major Pakistani importers for $350 to $500 depending on the model, finish and---more importantly in that part of the world---your bargaining skill.\n\nThe higher-end NP 42 usually commands a $50 to $100 dollar premium over the CF98. In the Pakistani market, the CF98''s price is half that of polymer Tauruses and Glocks, and one-third that of the Beretta Storm PX4 and Smith and Wesson M & P.\n\nThe over-all shooters'' impressions of the CF98 is that is is comfortable in the hand with an excellenct three-to-four poiund trigger, and it has amild recoil and good accuracy. However, it does require a couple hundred round of break-in period, and its fit and finishing are not up to US standards.\n\nOne Pakistani user has fired more than 10,000 rounds through his CF98. The barrel shows little wear and is still accurate. The pistol handles the cheapers plinker ammo to the military-grade +P+ pressure 9mm made for the MP5 without a hiccup. The submachinegun load does increase the felt recoil by quite a bit, but the word is its''s manageable.\n\nThe CF 98 was tested from the bench by one of th Pakistani owners. Of the two CF98 samples tested, one proved more accurate at close range while the other shot better at distance.\n\nThe test ammunition used during the testing was the Pakistan Ordnance Factory-produced 2Z ball, which is not a very accurate round by our standards.\n\nFive rounds were fired at each distance with the following results:\n\n10 meters: 1.25 inch and 2.2 inches\n20 meters: 3.0 and 2.8\n30 meters: 8.5 and 5.3\n\nSince the Pakistani military has stopped issuing sidearms to its officers in the last few years, many of those military officers bought their own CF98s as back-ups to their current-issue MP5 or Type56/AK folders. The CF 98 has also been popular with Pakistani law enforcement personnel, who prefer it over their issued old revolvers or worn-out Type 54/Tokarevs.\n\nBy the time the Type 92 series ceases production sometime in the distant future, it will certainly be one of the most produced handguns in history---simply due to the vast size of the Chinese military, security forces and law enforcement.\n\n-end of article[/FONT]', 1, 0, '182.179.88.149', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Admittedly I am not familiar with business practices in the region, but IMHO Caracal''s actions and reactions have been completely unprofessional. If its been confirmed that a product has caused bodily harm to a customer during regular use, the first thing the company should have done was compensate for monetary loss and injury. If that had happened in a timely fashion, I''m certain the affected party would be much more willing to downplay the situation, and we may not even be having this discussion now. But since that did not happen, a representative of the company most certainly should not have been on this forum antagonizing the matter. Then, once a recall notice is issued, the facilities, beauracracy, and resources to carry through with it should be in place, immediately upon publication of the notice. There should be no delays, or excuses of any kind once the company makes a public announcement to do something. No reputable company would survive long, let alone prosper, conducting business this way. It just seems to me like Caracal is just dragging this matter along hoping people would get over it eventually. If the market is fine with that, then so be it.

Yes, I have been able to come up with a solution to save scopes from breakage by designing, preparing and installing a Recoil-less Rifle Mount (RR Mount). As you know that in a 54, the metal parts are riding on rails which results in the recoil-less mechanism as far as the shooter is concerned. I used this feature to my benefit by preparing a mount which has disengaged any and all contact between the scope and the metal parts. Now my scope is riding on the mount which is connected with the wooden parts. Please note that no holes have been made in the wooden parts or alteration been done to the gun itself. The pictures may give you some idea. Its final finishing is still in progress and will be completed in a day or two.

Yes, I have been able to come up with a solution to save scopes from breakage by designing, preparing and installing a Recoil-less Rifle Mount (RR Mount). As you know that in a 54, the metal parts are riding on rails which results in the recoil-less mechanism as far as the shooter is concerned. I used this feature to my benefit by preparing a mount which has disengaged any and all contact between the scope and the metal parts. Now my scope is riding on the mount which is connected with the wooden parts. Please note that no holes have been made in the wooden parts or alteration been done to the gun itself. The pictures may give you some idea. Its final finishing is still in progress and will be completed in a day or two. After I have filed it, I am going to get it blued which will complete this project.

I adjusted the objective lens to set the parallax at abut 60-70 yards. Now at full 9x magnification it gives use-ably clear image from 30 to 100+ yards. when it comes to 10-11 yards, it can not focus when at 9x (obvious), so when I have to shoot at 11 or so yards, I decrease the magnification to 3 or 4x, and image gets clear.\nParallax or focus of objective can be further adjusted to bring more close but then at longer ranges it will not focus clearly at 9x. So it is best to set the parallax of non-AO scopes at 60 or 70 yards to use full (9x) magnification in the field.\nAs far as Diopter adjustment (eye piece rotation) is concerned, as I use -2.75 spectacles so I had to adjust it already \nto make the reticle clear.

Your acquisition is truly a fine weapon. \nI would however, give you a heads-up on the following issues, since you mentioned that you would be keeping the weapon as a SD weapon in a vehicle:\n\n1- The .357 magnum round from a snub nose causes a HUGE muzzle flash. The ported model directs a big portion of that flash upwards. Hence if you are shooting it from a position where the ports would face you (very easy to do in a vehicle when pointing the weapon slightly upwards from the seat position to say the window), you MIGHT be exposing yourself  to burns yourself. If you happen to shoot from the driver side towards the passenger window, you might be risking burning the passenger , even if the muzzle if far clear of the passenger. \n2- The .357 magnum from a snub nose produces a very loud report. I have had the unfortunate experience of shooting the same without hearing protection in the OPEN and my ears were ringing for a considerable time. I can only assume that shooting the same in an enclosed place (such as indoors or within a vehicle) could cause serious damage to the hearing.\n \nThe above are my personal opinions in view of my experience with this weapon. I would not want a fellow pakgunner to be in any harms way.\nI would recommend that you do your own research on this.\n\nBest regards[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Trajan, would you recommend a model without portholes over ported ones? consider 6-incher 627 tracker for this case..', 1, 0, '202.69.13.182', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Mind you this is my most trusted Center-Point 4-16x40AO scope, which is an airgun rated scope and has lasted 2500+ shots on my Hatsan mod 125 sniper. But today, this is what happened. Which further reiterates the fact that even the most sturdiest of scopes DO fail on air guns. Another one of my quite expensive "NON-airgun rated" scope did not last 300-400 shots on it. The scope still works fairly well on shorter distances (up to 30-40 yards) but beyond that (60+ yards) the group opens up quite dramatically, and is rather waste of ammo due to wide open groups at that distance. So for now I''m back to pen sights till I buy another one.\r\n\r\nI wasn''t able to hit my target at 70 yards and began to worry as the groups would open up to 3-4 inches. The gun was dieseling quite a lot as i used it after a month and it wouldn''t settle despite having shot over 50-60 pellets. So I ran the JSB heavies through it and after 10 odd shots the dieseling had subsided (it cme back with lighter pellets but not as much). I cleaned the barrel, took of the moderator, tried heavier pellets, all in vain!! Same result every time. On shorter distance (15-20 yards) the groups would  squeeze to under 1 inch but still not as it used to shoot. Frustration really kicked in and I thought there might be something wrong with the barrel or internals. \r\n\r\nAfter few more shots something rattled and upon inspection I discovered that the, the illumination switch was hanging on the side. I took off the scope, shook it and it produced slight rattling sound. I shot a group at 15 yards with open sights and to my relief it was as tight as it would shoot at distance with scope. I adjusted the open sights as they hadn''t been in use for a long time and I was back in business :D finally, nothing wrong with the rifle but the scope I believe has served its purpose :p It still works but in that condition it wont last long before being damaged further.\r\n\r\nThe gun is dieseling which worries me still and I''ll most probably visit Khilji on Wednesday to open it up and clean it as i suspect we kind of over lubed when we opened her last time.', 1, 0, '199.68.218.40', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The rating will not include local made weapons as they are not worth considering (at least to me). Let''s start:\r\n\r\nA Category: I will put all exotic custom built weapons produced by specialized companies. In this list, I will put brands like Holland & Holland, James Purdy, Boss, Some Products of Beretta & Browning, Blazer, Merkel and etc. These weapons are mostly made to order by hand and by using best available materials, tools & techniques and craftsmanship. These weapons are result of decades of research & development and experience.\r\n\r\nB Category: In this Category, I will put all production weapons produced by centuries old companies mostly based in Europe like Beretta, Browning, Beneli, Heckler & Kosch, SigSaur, some products of CZ and etc. These weapons are produced after specialized research and best metallurgy, tools and techniques. \r\n\r\nC Category: In this category, I will put mass production but well-reputed, reliable and reasonably priced weapons produced by famous companies based in Europe, US and East Europe like AyA, Winchester, Remington, CZ, Francchi, Vepr, Mossberg, Fabarm and etc. These weapons are result of years of research & development and have good metallurgy but are made to address the need of masses.\r\n\r\nD Category: In this category, I will include mass production weapons which are produced by some reputed companies but the designs are inspired / replicas of weapons falling in B category. There are some indigenous designs as well. The metallurgy, tools and techniques used to make these weapons are very good and there is some amount of research & development is also involved. In this category, I will include weapons made by Cottage Industry in Europe, East Europeans, Russian, South American and East Asian companies like Baikal, Taurus, Marocchi, Saiga, Tula, Armscor, Daewoo and etc.\r\n\r\nE Category: This category includes replicas made by Turkish and Chinese companies. These are simply good copies are famous weapon mostly falling in "B" and "C". The metallurgy, tools and techniques used to produce these weapons are good but there is no research & development behind these guns as the designs are simply copied. In this category, I will include weapons produced by Norinco, Hatsan, Akkar, Canik55 and etc. Please do not confuse the reputed companies which have shifted their production to Turkey.

The R8 does have finish and feature options that could easily increase its price.\n\nThe idea of producing a modular rifle is not new, nor is it unique. The simplest modular approach may be the single shot products of Thompson Center where stocks and barrel swaps control chamber and long gun/handgun configurations. The Krieghoff Semprio is an inline bolt action repeater that, through interchangeable barrels, can be configured to a long list of standard and magnum cartridges. Even Savage brought interchangeable barrels and bolt heads to budget bolt action rifles.

It is also important to keep the breach and the muzzle crown, especially the latter, absolutely defect free. A defective muzzle crown will totally ruin the accuracy of any rifled barrel. Furthermore, airgun barrels are usually not as hard as firearm barrels. Therefore, one should be very careful during the cleaning process, not to nick the barrel by using inappropriately sized rods and brushes. \n\nAfter going through many commercially available cleaning kits, and wrecking them - the cleaning rods were always the weakest link. I got my own cleaning rod made. Quite simply, all I did was get a one yard long length of 5mm diameter stainless steel rod, machined a handle out of 12mm thick rod and welded that to one end of it. The other end has a male thread on it, one that fits the Hoppe''s cleaning brushes that I have. \n\nI learnt the hard and expensive way, but if you want to have a sturdy and dependable cleaning kit, simply get the appropriate sized nylon  and phosphor bronze brushes that you need and get your own cleaning rod made. Mine cost me all of Rs. 800 compared to the Rs.2000 I paid for the Hoppe''s aluminum rod. \n\nWith regards to cleaning oils, I have found Rust-o-Nil by NASA (not the space shuttle guys), to be even better than WD40. And if you have the patience, then even better is 50% automatic transmission fluid mixed with 50% kerosene oil. A liter of each will cost you about Rs. 300 in total, and the two liters of cleaning oil that you thus make, will last a lot longer and cost a lot cheaper than a 400ml aerosol spray of the cheapest cleaning oil. \n\nI reccommend cleaning  the bore after every tin of pellets, i.e 250 shots or 500 shots. This way you will avoid any stubborn lead deposits and will not need to use hard metal brushes, (which can potentially damage the barrel, if used incorrectly), to clean the barrel.  After you have thoroughly rogered the barrel with the nylon brush, run a few cotton patches through it, until you get one that comes out absolutely clean.  (The best cotton patches are made from old white T-shirts and vests).\n\nOnce the barrel is absolutely clean, run a lightly oil patch through it (use Hoppe''s gun oil), and you''re good to start shooting again.', 1, 0, '182.178.0.123', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Today I tried out the RR Mount at a distance of 40 yards and got a group which was scattered almost 2 inches all around the bulls-eye and in my opinion that''s not even close to OK. I had to re-zero the scope several times for the next 20 shots and managed to decrease the distance between the scattered hits however, I wasn''t and am still not satisfied. OK, I do understand that there is the error of the shooter as well (and I am using Gamo Pro magnum 15.43 gr pellets) but day before yesterday I literally shot three pellets through a single hole using the RR Mount, so now I believe its not holding its zeroing the way I expected. I did check the two assembly points on the mount for movement but was not able to find any.

I had to re-zero the scope several times for the next 20 shots and managed to decrease the distance between the scattered hits however, I wasn''t and am still not satisfied. OK, I do understand that there is the error of the shooter as well (and I am using Gamo Pro magnum 15.43 gr pellets) but day before yesterday I literally shot three pellets through a single hole using the RR Mount, so now I believe its not holding its zeroing the way I expected.

Making the case with a hollow rim provides the space for the   chemicals. \n\n 	            Priming compound is a mechanical mixture of lead styphnate,   antimony sulfide, barium nitrate, and other chemicals.  This  combination will create heat and gas  when struck sharply. For rimfire  cartridges, raw wet priming mix is placed  directly in the hollow rim  cavity. Binders provide all the holding power that  keeps the primer in  place. Some rimfire mixes differ from their centerfire  counterparts by  the addition of a frictionator (helps ignition in the rimfire  system),  which may be finely ground glass. The priming chemicals are blended in controlled  facilities, often  by remote control. Adding water to the mix makes it less  dangerous to  handle and allows the mass to be shaped. Even with these  precautions,  transporting primer mix is hazardous; cartridge cases are moved to  the  primer chemistry facility rather than moving the primer mix to the case   loading location.\n	\nThe priming process steps are as follows:\n\n 	\n[LIST=1]\n[*]The wet mix is forced into small holes in a  nonsparking metal charge plate that sets a fixed volume of mix in each hole.\n[*]The filled plate is placed over a tray of  rimfire cases; the tray has the same hole pattern as the charge plate.\n[*]A third plate with multiple pins, corresponding  to the hole pattern in the charge plate, is pressed through the charge plate.\n[*]The individual disks of priming mix fall into  the cases.\n[/LIST]\n 	To ensure that the mix is uniformly distributed into the  hollow rim  cavity of the case, both downward and centrifugal force is applied  during  the spinning operation. A rotating spinner quill enters each  case, causing the  case to spin at high speed. The working end of the  quill forces the wet mix  toward the cavity and the spinning distributes  the primer mix to uniformly fill  the cavity.\n\n 	Voids in the mix in the rim cavity can cause a misfire. Most   manufacturers have stringent visual or electronic inspection procedures  that  reject any cases that do not have the proper distribution of  priming mix.                                                                      \n\nAfter spinning, the cases are placed in low-temperature  ovens to  eliminate the moisture. Before moving to the load line, the cases are   tested for primer sensitivity. A sample of dried cases from each lot is   selected.  The cases are placed in a test  machine with a vertical  cartridge chamber  beneath a steel ball of known weight.  The ball is dropped on the cases  from a series of heights. At each height  setting, the operator notes  the percentage of cases that fire. As the height  increases, the energy  applied to the case becomes greater, increasing the  number of fired  cases. Eventually, the height reaches a point where all cases fire.\n\n 			 	By applying standard statistical procedures to the data  matrix of  fired cases and corresponding heights, a value is generated that can  be  compared to published specifications for primer sensitivity. If that  value  falls within specifications, the cases are released for loading.', 1, 0, '182.189.19.237', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I almost forgot to mention...along with me was Ch_Adnan, a firearm enthusiast who is now starting to realize how interesting and fun airguns can be....\n\nConsidering it was lunch time, Khilji immediately made arrangements for some very nice Biryani served with chilled Pepsi...and trust me guys, it was awsome....\n\nlater we tried out some shots from Khilji`s Diana 54 and Webley and Scott (Synthetic Stock).....\n\nAnyhow, later Khilji shared with us few of his self created gadgets which included:\n\n[B]Custom Made Zeroing Stand:\n\n[/B][ATTACH=CONFIG]20577[/ATTACH]\n\n[B]2 Inch Spinner Targets:\n\n[/B][ATTACH=CONFIG]20578[/ATTACH]\n\nAnd the most interesting of all was.......Khilji is currently working on a project and is very confident about its sucess Insha Allah... he is working on developing a PCP Rifle and below is a picture of his unfinished project\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20579[/ATTACH]\n\nNow is that awsome or what.... He targets to develop an Airgun which is able to do around 1100 fps....\n\nAnyhow getting back to Kral..... the mystery was solved by Khilji is just 5 mins and I just don''t know how I missed it in all this time... below is a picture, try to figure out whats the fault....\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20580[/ATTACH]\n\n\nYup.. U got it... the front sight was slightly tilted towards the right side....causing the deflection... the barrel was never bent...however the front sight on my Kral did not have a screw for adjustments so it had to be twisted by applying pressure... and with a couple of twists and turns we were able to align it right in the middle...... just because of the way the silencer/supressor was attached to the barrel, it just appeared that there is no way it was going to loose its center, but I suppose the loading of over 1500 to 2000 times gradually turned the silencer/suppressor enough to cause the resulting deflection of 5-6 inches....\n\nAs soon as we were done aligning, tried several shots and the gun was shooting even better than ever.... next using Khilji`s Chorony we checked out the velocities for all the airguns...\n\nWebley was shooting at an Avg. of 880 fps\nDianna 54 was shooting at an Avg. of 820 fps\nKral was shooting at an Average of 420 fps\n\nKhilji made another inspection and realized that the Breach seals of my Kral were completely burnt and a lot of pressure was releasing from there.... He asked one of his technicians to make a Teflon Seal for my Airgun.. Teflon is a white plasticy material known for its extremely high temperature resistance and low friction.... Immediately after the seal was inserted, we checked in Chorony again and guess what... this time my Kral was doing an avg. of 525 fps...... and rise in over 100 fps straight up.....\n\nBy the time we got done with the seal, it was almost evening and we decided to head back..... Khilji was kind enough to gift is 2 inch target spinners to me along with approx a 100 card pieces to be used as airgun targets (perfect groups were coming on these cards, no extra tears at all).....\n \nIt was a great day spend with Khilji, got to learn alot of new things... and this was yet another great experience with another very humble and courteous Pak Gunner... \n\nNext projects: Khilji did notice that my Kral spring was totally dry.... the next time we are going to lube the Kral and see how it performs after that... also very anxious to find out the fps at which my new Gamo Shadow is spitting....\n \nShoot Safe and have a nice day...', 1, 1, '110.93.196.12', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I remember thinking it was a decent handgun and a good shooter. Infact I bought one for my brother as a home defense gun. The gun has a 19 shot mag capacity with a SA/DA trigger and a 4 inch barrel. The sights are fixed and a cocked and locked style safety and decocker are also present. The gun weighs around 900 grams, is well machined and the finish is good. \r\n\r\nThe trigger is a little hard and takes 5/6 shots getting used to. The back sights although fixed can be manually adjusted with a hammer if required. \r\n\r\nThere is nothing new or unusual about the gun, it''s a 92/99 with a one inch shorter barrel.

Once the gun is no longer hot to the touch, clean up the oil on the stock etc, and then put it back in the car for another hour of sunbathing, (make sure you put a few old newspapers under it). This practice ensures that the oil seeps down  to the very bottom of the rust and loosens it.  Before you take the gun out, look through the rear windshield, and see if any oil is visible on the metal parts, specially the rusted ones. It shouldnt be, it should have all seeped in. \n\nSo assuming that the oil has all seeped in, take the gun out and get to work on the rusted parts with a patch of steel wool. Rubbing it in a gentle motion without much downward pressure, before long you will have gotten rid of the rust but not the bluing!  If the rusting isn''t very bad, then use fine steel wool, but if it is, then first use coarse steel wool, then medium grade, and finally fine. \n\nTo clean your steel wool patch while working, pour some kerosene oil in a small bowl and rinse the patch in it from time to time. (Dispose of the kerosene safely once you are done). \n\nWhen you feel you have taken off all the rust, clean the gun with a soft cloth or tissue and have a good look at it in the sun and also feel the barrel and receiver with your hand to check if you have missed any spots. \n\nOnce you are assured that you have done your best. Get down to cleaning the gun with alcohol swabs, so that there is not trace of oil left on it anywhere. The best way to do it is to remove the action from the stock. Take off the trigger guard, front sights, rear sight, and any other accessories that can come off and clean those too.  Plug the muzzle with an cotton tipped, vaseline dipped earcleaning bud, and cover the cocking lever slot and trigger with masking tape. Then spray the action and the barrel with primer, wait for it to dry, and then spray it with paint. \n \nThe best primer and paints to use for rust protection are the marine grade ones. Failing that regular mild steel primer and spray can oil paints will do too, but dont forget that several thin coats are better than  a few thick coats. Oil paints dry quite slowly to begin with and a thick coat hardly ever dries fully, not unless you put it in the oven.', 1, 0, '182.178.15.136', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But was very polite about it and simply told me at first that he didn''t want any liabilities due to politics. \n\nBut anyway I finally got to meet him in person. We had a blast! Since I went early in morning, he gave me 3 hours with him  since he was training. He offered to teach me basic functionalities and almost complete break down into 30+ parts and reassembly. It was just amazing being taught by a professional. He also showed me some Glock training videos. He told me, he got all training in Austria. He turned me into an amateur Glock Gunsmith (just kidding). \n\nHere are some of stuff I purchased. Mostly original OEM parts and a few aftermarket.\n\n[IMG][IMG]http://i1063.photobucket.com/albums/t511/gunfreak2/2CB489F4-B8B7-41EC-A732-BFE7983533BC-19919-00000EC1B4F11D71_zps90fb2a57.jpg[/IMG][/IMG]', 1, 0, '119.160.57.93', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Semi auto (Autoloader)\ngood for all-around use however most recommended for dove and waterfowl hunting\n\n2. Side by Side\ngood for all-around use however most recommended for upland\n\n2.

And WOW, what a range this guy is enjoying. Some are very nice ideas for rifle & airgun shooting.\n\n\n[QUOTE=Kashif Baig;360120]Tareen sb, I always admire your out of box thinking and as usual you have come up with this unique yet simple idea of devising this target stand. I have one query though, i.e. how do you carry this stand with you at the range? I mean from the pics it looks quite large to carry easily in your car or jeep. Or perhaps you are using it at your backyard. Secondly, what steel gauge you used for making those plates and can these handle any bigger caliber as well and if not what gauge you cosider using for bigger bores like 7mm and above.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you very much brother for liking the effort. \n\nThe stand''s dimensions are H3'' x L3'' xW2'' so I can fit three of them in the back of a Pajero stuffed in each other. Cannot be transported by car though. As it is going to be a one time transport to my farmhouse, no worries. Originally, I designed one that was collapsible but inherently unstable due to moving hinges. I''ll be putting them there permanently. \n\nThe gauge or thickness of the plates is about 3.5mm to be precise (with paint ;-0 ). It seems to be very appropriate for strength and for that audible chime when low power air gun pellets & rimfire bullets hit them at a distance. Thicker the plate, lesser the chime ;-) & lesser the swing. So lesser audio - visual effect on hitting the target. \n\nFor centerfire calibers, 10 mm should be the least thickness depending on the distance. Closer the distance,thickness should be more. I have no experience with such thick targets, so my input will be mere theory on that. Getting it hardened would extend its life for taking couple of hundred shots in the same spot.\n\n[QUOTE=Avais;360152]A good project brother, However it requires some safety measures to avoid any prospective risk of ricochet.\n1. You may place the face of steel plates slightly downward. This will stop reverse ricochet of the bullet and any ricochet particular will tend to move downward.\n2. There must be thin steel sheets on the sides extended at least one feet of frame facing the shooter. This will stop any ricochet particulars flying left or right.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanx a lot Avais Bhai. As i have mentioned, the nearest stand will be at 50 meters from the shooter and I''ll be shooting airgun & .22LR & WMR on them only. Being in an isolated private zone, I think we will not have any issues with ricochet, backstop or similar safety concerns. InSha Allah. \n\nSecondly, the plates are on bearings and will tend to move back & upwards providing somewhat downward rebound angle to the bullets.\n\nThanx again for your valuable input.  \n\n[QUOTE=Ch_Adnan;360261]very nice tareen bro.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you brother.\n\n[QUOTE=joney;360273]Exact that point came into my mind.\n\nVery well done tareen sir.. i think this target stand will be permanently fixed on the range as it isn''t handy enough to carry on each visit.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you so much brother [B]joney.[/B]&#8203; Yes, it will be permanently fixed on the range. \n\nI have tried to answer the concern in response to Avais Brother''s reply.\n\n[QUOTE=sadatpk;360277]v nice work Tareen sb[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThank you so much brother.', 1, 1, '110.39.2.198', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

SC without rails in market has asking price of Rs. 85000/= while caracal-F I bought yesterday at Rs 73000/=. So its clear that there has been a certain surge in value of SC while a piece with rails is very difficult to find in market.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20723[/ATTACH]\nLooks...\nBoth guns are of the same size as I compared them.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20724[/ATTACH]\nSlides...\nSC on left, hammer fired pistol.\nCaracl-F on right, striker fired pistol.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20725[/ATTACH]\nBarrels... and as I know longer barrel means better accuracy.\nCaracal-F''s barrel on left while SC rotating barrel on right.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]20726[/ATTACH]\nEven though SC has smaller barrel but it has bigger recoil spring then Caracal-F.', 1, 1, '110.38.85.126', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

These tests were carried out by the Federal German Armed Forces Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in Meppen, Germany which included metallurgic and composite analysis, functional fitness-for-purpose and quality evaluation, endurance firing, environmental exposure, safety and accuracy tests. A certificate was issued by the Bundeswehr Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in May 2006 after the pistol successfully complied with the NATO D14 standard, the German Federal Police Standard and the German Federal Armed Forces Technical Purchasing requirements. These tests are the most stringent test protocols ever devised for a service firearm.\n\n\nBy the end of 2006, Caracal International L.L.C .was incorporated and registered as a company in Abu Dhabi. With that, the foundation of a pistol manufacturing industry was established for the first time in the GCC.\n\n\nThe pistols were unveiled at the International Defence Exhibition, IDEX 2007 in Abu Dhabi. In February 2007 25,000 Caracal F pistols in 9 mm were ordered by various armies and security forces of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The Caracal pistol is now the new service pistol of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Jordan as of April, 2008. The United Arab Emirates and Algeria established on November, 17th, 2008 a joint committee in order to test the Caracal pistol for further adoption by Algeria.\n \nThe Caracal pistols were originally slated to be introduced into the European market and made available to Austrian customers in early 2009; this was rectified at the IDEX 2009 exhibition, when Caracal announced that an export line to Italy was to be started with "the first samples delivered immediately after the IDEX". The Caracal pistols have been introduced on the Italian civilian/sport shooters market during the 2009 EXA expo (Brescia, 18–21 April 2009), and are being imported by the Italian arms company Fratelli Tanfoglio S.N.C.\n\n\n[URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_pistol[/URL][/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 1, '110.93.196.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I did a little on line research - rusting is found in some CZ pieces - NIB; at times it also develops over a period of use (approx. 150 bullets per month for 4 - 6 months i.e. after six hunderd shots). It is either due to the steel forging process employed by CZ or some other metal (Carbon Steel / Copper / alloy combination. But the experts on those forums take it very lightly & suggest using solvents & the like. So if your serial on gun and box and the shoot target matches - feel safe. But ensure that the patch / stain does not grow. Also bad machining with sharp edges is considered normal with CZ guns (except feed ramp - which is always exceptional).\n\n\n2. Before making actual purchase please ensure:\n\n\na. That the dealer has good reputation.\nb.  If it is your first or second gun, then take someone senior, who is well versed with the arms (hand gun or else) you intend to buy.\nc.  Un-assemle the gun and take a look inside; of the interiors as well as parts. Here your experienced companion should really shine.\nd.  Use a white piece of paper / mobile light for checking the inside of the barel.\ne.  Do multiple times: Dry fire  / rake the slide / magazing release / fall / bullet feeding the magazine / slide locking on empty magazine.\nf.   Match the numbers i.e. serial on gun and box and the shoot target.\ng.  If any part or portion, say the magazine is discoloured (as in additional paint or artificial shine) it may represent usage. \n\n\nI am sure that seniors can further expand this list.\n\n\nHowever all may not apply in all conditions / specially in case of knock-offs (which are technically NIB).\n\n\nNIB means new in box gun, which has not fired more than a couple of rounds from point of origin (factory / delaer) & primarily consists of original parts (though it may have some additional / altered parts - as per customization service - for eg. CZ Customs improves the gun by making alteration in sights, trigger etc as per customer''s request).  \n\n\nPlease let me know if one needs [U]to check anything more specific to purchasing Shadow in Karachi.[/U]\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nAlirablm', 1, 0, '27.255.53.71', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

WOW!\nWhat I mean by that is, Pakgunners truly are serious enthusiasts. I''ve been on many gun forums and have not come across one where there is such a popular and enthusiastic club for a $3000-3500 hand gun! I know a lot of shooters, and maybe 1 of them has a $5000 pistol (Nighthawk custom 1911), otherwise the max would be about $1500-1800 (usually Kimber 1911''s and special edition Sigs). For a plastic gun, I personally would only spend a max of $700, and the last time I did that (for an SA XD Tactical) I felt ripped off. Regardless, it is an interesting illustration of supply and demand, along with local market characteristics. Also curious as I have yet to hear of anyone mention the G20 and baby 29 on this forum. Is 10mm not available in Pakistan, or just not popular? Interested in opinions because I just ordered my first one in the form of a 3rd Gen G20 SF.[/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[SIZE=4][FONT=arial]\n[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nGood to hear from you Fudgepacker.

We do have some relatively reasonably priced brand guns from Czech Republic, Turkey, Serbia, Russia, Brazil, China etc. \n\nRegarding Glock 20/29, well 10mm ammo is not available here that''s why dealers are not importing the 10mm Glocks or other brands in 10mm. The most common calibers used/liked here in Pak. are 7.62x25 and 9mm. While .45ACP is also favorite of many people but not as much as 9mm or 7.62.

But  regardless,  I was actually instantly excited for you when you mentioned the .40SW because it is my favorite caliber. But to qualify that statement, it is only in regards to recreational shooting. I like it because I enjoy high recoiling guns, and with all else being equal (weight, size, shape of gun), the 40 is the "snappiest" among 9, 40, 45, and even equal to a 10mm (depending on load), so for me it is the most fun to shoot. The 45 is a very close 2nd however, especially shooting paper targets, because I like the noticeably bigger holes they make :) \nHowever, if we are speaking practically, many consider the 40 to be a "compromised" round, which some people feel is a good thing. I will explain. When it comes to choosing a caliber for fighting, in all the pistol craft, tactical shooting, and self defense courses I took, the majority of trainers I''ve come across share the viewpoint that IF you had the choice, either choose "big"(45) or choose "a lot of" (9mm). So thats the theory Ive learned to follow, and therefore the 40 is a compromise between the two choices. But like I said, some people see the 40 as being a bit of both. Personally, for self defense in an urban environment, I prefer 9mm because you have the advantage of carrying a lot of rounds (with a G17 for example, you have more firepower than someone carrying a 1911 AND a spare mag), and with high quality defense cartridges these days, you have all the penetration and stopping power you''ll ever need to take down a robber or a car jacker.

But those cunning lil birds were completely hidden in thick Kikar trees and were absolutely camouflaged. We got to see around 21 of them, that was when they out of nowhere flew out of the trees we wouldn''t even imagine they''d be perched in.\nLater 2 of the doves that flew out of trees circled around and sat on a leaf-less tree 60 yards away.\nI stalked closer taking cover behind trees, range finder showed 30 yards then. Took an upper body shot and got the only bird of the hunt! But it was well worth it!! All the money and time spent reaching there.\nThough the partridges, especially black males were very tempting but we didn''t shoot them as its off season, decided to keep a hunt in Winters.\nAll in all a great trip, very beautiful setting, cool weather, good walk in nature rich in flora and fauna----> saw 2 jackals, a hare, 10 black partridges, 4 grey partridges, 22 labairs in their habitat.\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/5af3d9df-5287-47d1-adf8-3a055dc84a42_zpsd9084392.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/5af3d9df-5287-47d1-adf8-3a055dc84a42_zpsd9084392.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/labairhunt026_zpsb1ede505.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/labairhunt026_zpsb1ede505.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/labairhunt027_zpse2539c26.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/labairhunt027_zpse2539c26.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/labairhunt018_zps76ba6c12.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/labairhunt018_zps76ba6c12.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nReady to cook\n[URL=http://s1203.photobucket.com/user/B77W/media/labairhunt046_zpsb345ca11.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/labairhunt046_zpsb345ca11.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nIt was delicious!', 1, 0, '119.73.1.182', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

We don''t look twice at anything that doesnt have a brand name and lifetime warranty, nine out of ten stores sell online, so if one place reduces prices, everyone else will match it if they want to keep doing business. Bottom line variance for any given gun may vary by $100 at most from one side of the country to the other, and you don''t need a "reference" to get those prices. I appreciate the differences in how our markets operate, but what bothers me, is that guns like Sigs, Glocks, and HKs are supposed to be tools... mass produced tools. They are for the everyday man to protect a home... like a hammer used to build a home. Its not supposed to be a luxury. We''re not talking about custom, gold plated one off, "safe queens". Whereas full auto is really just a novelty, since it can''t be used for self defense (without destroying your house, or killing every other innocent bystander on the street), nor can it be used recreationally for fun, target practice, or hunting (can''t shoot at most ranges except for special events, can''t shoot on public land ie. in woods or open fields). But even if all that was possible and the guns were cheap, it would still be cost prohibitive ammo wise. An M4/M16/AR15 has a sustained cyclic rate of approximately 800rds/min. We can get .223 ammo for about $8 per box of 20... that means a full mag is finished in 2 seconds, and cost $12... or $320/minute :0\nAnyways, the full auto fans here generally just use a Bumpski stock which does extremely well at mimicking a true full auto. Or go to a machine gun show and rent a guns to shoot, or go to special ranges. For all you full auto freaks, you must visit Las Vegas. I forget the name of the range, but there you can drive around in an suv with a roof mounted "''Ma Deuce" 50 cal and chase down a remotely controlled car to shoot and blow up :)', 1, 0, '24.84.168.75', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In 6 incher, both 608 and 627 work fine.

I got interested in them when I was in the market for local clones of the Taurus PT 92 series. \n\nI traced them to Shahid Watch company, MA Jinnah Road and fro then onwards to Decent Arms Co and finally their factory outlet behind the main Lucky Star Arms Market.\n\nWas all this hassle worth it? \n\nIn a nutshell yes! \n\nIf you keep aside the argument that ALL clones are rubbish then yes there is more eye candy there then anywhere else I have ever seen.  These people take Authenticity to extremes. From boxes to the actual weapon itself.  To manuals and mags.  By and large most of the authentic looking clones  in the market such as the Berretta Storm local clone at Noor Arms co (asking price 120k) and the Glock (asking price 100k again at Noor Arms Co.) the P 909 without rails in Matt black that I have fired at Mega Armoury asking 30k.  \n\nThe PT 92s going for 45k at Shahid arms co as well as Decent arms for the same price.  All of these weapons originated at Royal Arms Co. Being a factory outlet they supply to the whole market.\n\nSince I could not eliminate the I/O error I keep getting from my laptop. I have decided to upload em from my office computer.  (Surreptitiously of course) \n\nHabibullah the young proprietor is highly appreciative of forum members and always insists on taking us to his office for tea and drinks.  He has promised good discounts for Forum members. \n\nSo far Agha 007 has purchased an RAC product. He has so far fired around 70 80 shells without a hitch. He would be in a better position to comment on it. \n\nI have personally witnessed a .30 ak 47 type receiver  and AR 15 type adjustable tactical stock , drum Mag, manual safety and quad rail equipped  hybrid thingy shooting 400 + rounds without a hitch of local ammo at the airmen club. I straight away fell in love with it. And will shortly be acquiring a license for it. \n\nHabibullah does not believe in back dated licenses. However one licenses re-open the rates he has given are so low that I remain sceptical that he will actual be able to deliver.\n\nHe also does excellent copies of the Akdal M1919 for around 28 to 30k or so.  Also does hybrid shotguns that I have never seen. I really liked the wood on his KA 47 type seies of shotties complete with drum mags. \n\nI have been pestering him to make the Vepr 12 clones as well!\n\nHe does loads of SxS shotties as well.

Primary purpose is self defense and secondary is  obviously sports/shooting.\nin lahore we have Hira Arms and ParaCompany. Please let me know if they  can provide License? They are really far and cant visit them without  preparation. i need license which can cover lahore, atleast 100 rounds,  best if NPB so that i may use the same for 9mm and .30\n\nI hope i didn''t ask any thing irritating\n\nThanks[/QUOTE]\n\n\nWelcome to the forum bro....\n\nWell.. I`ll make it very simple for you... with 9mm you have Alot more options as compared to 30 Cal for handguns and it''s the modern day most widely used pistol amo as well....your options for 9mm Handguns will start from around 39-40k...\n\nHowever with 30 Cal, your options will start from 20K so if you are really tight on budget you can opt for a 30 Cal..But there is a catch...9mm bullets will cost you between Rs 36-40 atleast whereas 30 cal will cost you around Rs. 40-45 \n\nAnother major difference is that in 9mms your Mag Capacity is alot more than 30 Cal... Different 9mms can hold from 13 rounds up till 18 rounds where as 30 Cal can hold 9 rounds....\n\nThese are few very basic differences... there are more technical ones but you need to inform us regarding your use and budget so that perhaps we can recommend you from there.... but these are few very basic differences...\n\nHope this info helps', 1, 1, '110.93.196.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You can see my review and experience here\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?9256-My-new-zigana-M1911-45-acp[/URL]\n\nThe reason i parted with it was because of these issues. \n1) This model had fixed sights which i didn''t like. They were all black and very small. I like sights with some kind of dot system, weather 2 dot or 3 dot. Or adjustable rear sight with FO front sight ;). The sights on this gun were fixed to the slide and cannot be removed. \n\nSecondly the Mac-Gar mags that came with this gun started giving me problem later on. On the last round i use to have a FTF problem. \n\nThirdly the grip safety on that failed me couple of times so i got scared that i might have accidental fire. Besides I''ve used a friends Taurus PT1911, and its much better looking and well built gun then Tisas Zigana M1911. So i''d advise you to try Taurus PT1911.

Because no gun in the world is absolutely kaboom proof, regardless of price, brand, model, or country of origin. But, the chances of that happening are insignificant to nil, so if you really want to play with guns, don''t worry about it. Yet if you insist, consider this: perhaps you shouldn''t ever get into a car again, since the chances of getting into a wreck are exponentially higher than having a gun explode on you. I know a lot of people who shoot on a regular basis, they use everything from Norincos to Kimbers, and some only shoot reloaded ammo while the others only shoot factory ammo. But honestly, I don''t personally know anyone who has ever had a gun go kb on them. On the other hand, I can hardly think of anyone I know who has NOT been in a car accident. If one worries so much about something that in all likelihood won''t happen, I can''t imagine how they would deal with something that almost certainly will happen... just some food for thought.[/QUOTE]\n\nBrother welcome to Pakistan. Here everything happens and on record as well as off record HAPPENS. Just go to LRC ( Lahore Rifle Club ) and meet Mr. Younas Makkan, he will tell with real reference ( even if you are willing & just taking it as a Legend ) how many Kabooms hapenned in LRC alone, leave behind even the rest of Pakistan. You can make a List ( even shot but still a list not just a few names ) of Victims can personally meat them and Confirm the Kaboom, irrelevant of the fact whether they were using Darra made weapons, local reloaded cheap etc. take the Etiology out and you will be surprised by the facts and not fiction any way.\n\nCar accident is a total non comparable thing which people ( with due respect ) keep on giving and comparing with Guns. Well if you are doing it then please google also for the safest car to drive I dont which brand currently it is but Lincoln has won this award for many year i.e., chances of survival even after a fatal accident are less than driving obviously on Honda CD70 bike. \n\nCar accidents are UNAVOIDABLE in this modern world hard fact but have to swallow it vs Newly Chinese Discovered weapon and that too converted from one design to another in an obsolete cartridge ( atleast in the modern world ) creating 40000+ psi in chamber. \n\nPlz sir have a reality check on weapons they are never to be considered toys the factory / Company which is so called manufacturing this weapon PX-3 should have Factory tested the weapon from various angles and given a printed summary of it if not alongwith every weapon than atleast on their website. Nothing like that even exists.\n\nI am not against the weapons having a Dozen weapon licenses I am also a Gun Enthusiast & I even do not dislike or discourage the cheap weapons. I have them in my collection e.g., Chinese T T but sir it is not time but better to say "Generations Tested" weapon.\n\nSo, new and particularly not of good or any brand weapon should be tested but wearing enough protective measures or tested by a machine but unfortunately it can be done only in a Factory or a Company and not on any Range.\n\nMy concern is safety of my dear PG members & everyone who is not even reading this post.

Because no gun in the world is absolutely kaboom proof, regardless of price, brand, model, or country of origin. But, the chances of that happening are insignificant to nil, so if you really want to play with guns, don''t worry about it. Yet if you insist, consider this: perhaps you shouldn''t ever get into a car again, since the chances of getting into a wreck are exponentially higher than having a gun explode on you. I know a lot of people who shoot on a regular basis, they use everything from Norincos to Kimbers, and some only shoot reloaded ammo while the others only shoot factory ammo. But honestly, I don''t personally know anyone who has ever had a gun go kb on them. On the other hand, I can hardly think of anyone I know who has NOT been in a car accident. If one worries so much about something that in all likelihood won''t happen, I can''t imagine how they would deal with something that almost certainly will happen... just some food for thought.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAfter the Caracal episode I myself became so paranoid I used fire my weapons like a mortar, while holding em at arms length away from me.

Prime example is NP44 1911A1 that is world renowned for the best metal used in any 1911 produced to date (past and present). It is difficult to claim without any factual data that Chinese Sig is inferior to genuine Sig in metallurgy. NP22 has had 20k rounds put through it by a PK member of another forum and it is still going strong so it can''t be 50%. In finish, yes Chinese Sig lacks behind genuine Sig but that''s to be expected considering the price difference of more than double in USA.\n\nTorture test of 5000 rounds in 5 days you are suggesting would cost 200k+ in ammo, and an average buyer doesn''t spend that kind of money or fire these many rounds. 1500 rounds would be a good enough test imo.[/QUOTE]\nIMO, that has been the most logical post in the whole debate. \n\nFor those who are seriously paranoid about a gun exploding in their hands, maybe they should not be playing with guns in the first place.

That gives it the "break like a glass rod" feeling which the Glock is incapable of possessing because of its "half double action". The first portion of trigger travel will always have to finish cocking the striker before releasing it, hence it will always be two stage, have take up, and creep. Regardless of whatever modifications are done, the Glocks trigger can only be lightened. All factory triggers I''ve measured (2 gen 4s, 3 gen 3s, and 1 first gen) come in around 7.5lbs to 6.5lbs and the "-" connector will reduce that by about 0.5lbs. Its noticable, but just hardly, so if you can get the connector for about $10 give or take a couple, then its well worth it. I believe the best advise for someone getting into Glocks in Pakistan is... don''t expect a $3500 trigger because its NOT a $3500 gun. If you still end up buying into the hype; then get used to it!

Warped Supply and demand forces and regulations that affect it or what we call here crony capitalism, meaning politics and govt influence on the market or something else?  Mind you I know no politics discussions are allowed so keep it short and sweet please, Sir. Don''t want to make a moderator have to get involved, just trying to wrap my mind on the cause(s) demanding such a high premium for firearms.

(362803, 11395, 0, 'fahadleghari', 2815, 'Taurus PT809 revisited.', 1367759814, 'AOA, Fellow Pakgunners.\r\n\r\nThough there is already a thread running regarding review of Taurus Pt809 which belongs to midreestaj bro,i have decided to express my views towards the fine craftsmanship Brazilians have come up with :)\r\n\r\nTaurus 800 series is a direct descendant of famous 24/7 OSS. As a full-sized service handgun it’s proven to be rugged and reliable yet concealability was the issue. Taurus responded by taking some of the ergonomic features of the 24/7 OSS, adding a few innovations, trimming the size and weight, and introduced a new line of mid-sized (i call it mid sized) semi-auto handguns. The result was the Taurus 800 Series that was introduced back in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe PT809 is built on a polymer frame with a forged steel slide with a black Tennifer finish. A captive recoil spring with a full-length stainless steel guide rod in a cylindrical hard polymer tube which holds the recoil spring in place.\r\n\r\nThe empty weight is a relatively light 28.2 ounces. The ramped barrel measures 4 inches approx, providing an overall length of 8.25 inches, a height of 6-inches, and a width of 1.14 inches. An integral rail allows for easy mounting of light or laser. Capacity is 17+1.\r\n\r\nThe backstrap features Taurus aggressive ribbed checkering, while the rear portion of the side panels are smooth. The ribbed pattern continues on the front portion of the side panels and wraps around the front strap, where two slight projections create a subtle finger groove effect. Right and left side memory grooves channel the trigger finger to the proper position. Whenever i grab my pt809, shooting grip is automatically achieved which makes it a naturally comfortable handgun. \r\n\r\nThree interchangeable backstraps of different sizes are supplied in the box. They are changed by drifting out a solid retaining pin at the lower portion of the backstrap, which also serves as a lanyard loop, and sliding a different size insert into place. I have average-sized hands and the backstrap that arrived on the gun was an excellent fit for me, so I felt no need to try the other two sizes.\r\n\r\nAs PT809 was derived from the Taurus 24/7 OSS series, but the firing mechanism is quite a bit different.This is a traditional DA/SA design with an external hammer and has repeat strike capability and trust me it works for atleast. When the hammer is fully lowered it provides a lengthy DA pull with a slight, but noticeable, stacking at the rear of the stroke. Trigger Pull is 10.5 pounds in double action mode. \r\n\r\nWith the hammer in the SA mode the pull weight is a relatively crisp at 5 pounds approx. The trigger is smooth faced and nicely rounded.\r\n\r\nA frame-mounted ambidextrous safety allows the gun to be carried DA or SA (cocked and locked) and the safety can be engaged to block the trigger in each hammer position. The frame-mounted safety has a third position that also serves as a decocking mechanism. With the safety engaged in the up position, depressing it to the middle position disengages it. Push it further down to the third position and it decocks the pistol. The PT809 also includes an internal firing pin block that prevents the firing pin from moving forward until the trigger has been moved to its final firing position.\r\n\r\nCompleting the operating controls are ambidextrous slide and magazine releases. A loaded chamber indicator peeks out from the upper side of the extractor when a round is chambered.\r\n\r\nThe PT809 does not have a magazine disconnect safety, and will fire with the magazine removed. The double stack magazines are solidly made with right side witness holes at 5, 10 and 17 rounds and are a drop-free design. A finger extension base plate provides a comfortable rest for the support hand and also makes magazine insertion very positive. A magazine loader is provided, but I didn’t need it. Finger power alone was enough to easily get all 17 rounds into each of the two supplied magazines.\r\n\r\nSights are NOVAK 3 dot white pattern and are fixed.They are cut a bit taller than many other sights and allow a generous amount of light around the front sight. I found them very quick to acquire.\r\n\r\nThe PT809 is supplied in a plastic lockable case with a foam-lined pads with two magazines, a bristle bore brush, magazine loader, two additional interchangeable backstraps, and two keys to activate the Taurus Security System lock, which is located on the rear portion of the lower right rear grip panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[B]Final Verdict[/B]\r\nWell over 400 rounds went down through it, i never faced any FTF or FTE. All of this ammo was not used in one day range session but took a whole year. lols... I have used POF, Russian gray steel case (notorious for hard primers) Russian green case, Chinese red box, Chinese Blue box Sellier and Bellot HP and Federal FMJ but the PT809 delivered.\r\nThose who compare Taurus pt809 with Glocks and Sigs, please keep in mind that those weapons are four times the price of Taurus PT809 . This  handgun has proved itself to me and is my daily carry gun. I can trust my life with it. \r\nIt is not a piece of junk but a modern combat weapon yet providing all the features anyone can expect from a desirable handgun.\r\n\r\nOver to the pictures...', 1, 0, '182.185.152.81', 0, 1, 6, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Poor sights which are not change able without major work on its front sight.\n2. Limited magazine capacity.\n3. Difficult to load without first cocking the hammer.\n4. If you want to lower the hammer with a round in the chamber the hammer which lacks a hammer spur is prone to slipping and causing an AD ( accidental discharge ) many officers and men have died due to this reason only, including a very dear friend Capt Atif and another young Capt from the Army shooting team; these two I personally know about there were many more.\n4. Hollow points are prohibbited by Geneva Convention.\n5. The grip angle is poor and the gun is slow to point and shoot.\n6. It was designed with the Browing design  as its parent, There are many good innovations like the encapsulated trigger assembly, the inverted feed fingers or guide rails which ensure feeding through the cheapest and poorly made magazines and the cheapest means and cost of manufacture which was the over ridding clause for the Russians.\n7. There is no safety on it, there is no firing pin block on it and by modern standards it is now relic.\n\nRange of a hand gun depends on the accuracy of the pistol and the ability of a shooter, a good shot will be able to hit man sized targets at a 100 yards while shooting deliberately taking time, and in battle conditions may be only 15 to 20 meters, and an average  person/ soldier  can take deliberate shots at no mmore than 20 yards and in battle conditions at no more than 7 yards or so ( these distances are purely my guestimates; but then I do have some experience with hand guns and infantry men, 55 years and 30 years in that order ). \nMy advice buy a better pistol which is safe and dependable.[/QUOTE]\n\nFinally I figure out what''s exactly wrong with TT.

Caracal is certainly a nice firearm and with Muslim inheritance (coming from UAE), however I don''t recommend you a caracal as your first handgun. Because #1 its striker fired gun, you cannot decock it by any mean unless you remove mag, and rack the slide to eject bullet and then "dry fire" to decock it. And ultimately when you decock it as I have mentioned but you forget to remove mag (which has further bullets in it), the round in chamber will be ejected but a new live round will be chambered. Trust me! There are dozens of firearm experts on forum, but mistakes can happen!\n\nAlot of people have sold caracal because to them its not convenient to keep live round in chamber and rely on nothing but that tiny plastic clip on trigger. But those with guts still carry conceal-carry caracal.\n\n2. CZs I heard are good firearms but I personally have no experience of them so can''t say. \n\n3. PT92/99 are full frame pistols and they cannot easily be concealed. However did I read you have "quite big hands"? so it might be possible for you, so you can check that out. Tauruses are made in brazil.\n\n4. Stoeger Cougar, I will still recommend you to take a look at this gun, when I was a total noob myself... I choose SC as my companion and I never regret it, no matter it has fallen with chambered round, fired 3K+ rounds, etc...

Poor sights which are not change able without major work on its front sight.\n2. Limited magazine capacity.\n3. Difficult to load without first cocking the hammer.\n4. If you want to lower the hammer with a round in the chamber the hammer which lacks a hammer spur is prone to slipping and causing an AD ( accidental discharge ) many officers and men have died due to this reason only, including a very dear friend Capt Atif and another young Capt from the Army shooting team; these two I personally know about there were many more.\n4. Hollow points are prohibbited by Geneva Convention.\n5. The grip angle is poor and the gun is slow to point and shoot.\n6. It was designed with the Browing design  as its parent, There are many good innovations like the encapsulated trigger assembly, the inverted feed fingers or guide rails which ensure feeding through the cheapest and poorly made magazines and the cheapest means and cost of manufacture which was the over ridding clause for the Russians.\n7. There is no safety on it, there is no firing pin block on it and by modern standards it is now relic.\n\nRange of a hand gun depends on the accuracy of the pistol and the ability of a shooter, a good shot will be able to hit man sized targets at a 100 yards while shooting deliberately taking time, and in battle conditions may be only 15 to 20 meters, and an average  person/ soldier  can take deliberate shots at no mmore than 20 yards and in battle conditions at no more than 7 yards or so ( these distances are purely my guestimates; but then I do have some experience with hand guns and infantry men, 55 years and 30 years in that order ). \nMy advice buy a better pistol which is safe and dependable.[/QUOTE]\n\nvery nice say sir. plz compare .30 vs 9mm?', 1, 1, '119.157.205.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

MOI license in Islamabad was quoted as 26,000 and 45 days to get it. A provincial license in Dadyal was quoted as 5000 and 5 days to get it. I was tempted to get a provincial but then there was the problem of getting an authentic gun from Dadyal, ideally Taurus 24/7, and finally how I would get this gun from a provincial license transferred onto a MOI license. The NICOP card is fine to get a license. If any one is able to give me more information that would be good.\n\nIncidentally I went to International Arms in Islamabad, which was closed, but Draz Khan and Son, (Markaz 6) was good for Taurus, they quoted 82,000 for Taurus 24/7 gen 1.', 1, 0, '86.28.198.176', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

MOI license in Islamabad was quoted as 26,000 and 45 days to get it. A provincial license in Dadyal was quoted as 5000 and 5 days to get it. I was tempted to get a provincial but then there was the problem of getting an authentic gun from Dadyal, ideally Taurus 24/7, and finally how I would get this gun from a provincial license transferred onto a MOI license. The NICOP card is fine to get a license. If any one is able to give me more information that would be good.\n\nIncidentally I went to International Arms in Islamabad, which was closed, but Draz Khan and Son, (Markaz 6) was good for Taurus, they quoted 82,000 for Taurus 24/7 gen 1.[/QUOTE]\n\nVisit your local DCO Office and find out how much will an "All Pakistan" license issued from your local DCO Office cost you.

I also like Piranha F but found more fans of TP9 here.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nTp9 in a very good handgun indeed. However from the description you are giving of your self, when ever you go Gun Shopping, do look consider Viking and Caracal F.... If you are looking for something which is a bit more concealable yet gives a decent performance at range, you might consider a Stoeger Cougar, that gun has a fairly decent grip as well for big handed people...\n\nYou may consider and conduct further research on all of the above mentioned guns...\n\nMy Personal Preference is Caracal F...Why..? Well below is an analysis\n\n[B]Pros:[/B]\nAn extremely crisp trigger without any creep (4 pound constant trigger as compared to a 5.5 pound Glock trigger). Without any bias, IMHO, this gun has the most crisp trigger as compared to all of the above mentioned\n\nLow Bore Axis: which results in extremely low recoil and excellent for follow up shots. Again amongst all the above mentioned, this gun recoils the least\n\nExtremely Accurate and this is not just a personal observation. Almost all those who have shot with a Caracal F agree upon this.\n\nThis point is probably an extension to the point mentioned above. Caracal Fs come with a 4.1 inch barrel which is longer than most of the regular handguns. However Pt92s come with a 5 inch Barrel.... a longer barrel results in more accuracy and range but any weapon with too long a barrel might become problem to conceal\n\nThe gun is Polymer made and weights only 750 grams as compared to its counter Rival Glock 17 which weights 650 grams.. However all of the above mentioned handguns weigh more than Caracal.\n\nCaracal has extremly slim profile (Even slimmer than Glocks) which again makes them comparatively easier to conceal\n\nThe Full size Caracal F is slightly shorter than the Full size Glock 17 and just slightly longer than the Sub Compact Glock 19 which again supports in its Conceal\n\nCaracal F holds 18 Rounds, None of the above mentioned guns including Glocks hold that much fire power\n\nA Torture test was conducted by Armi on Caracal Fs. They shot 5000 rounds within 92 minutes through this gun without any failures. Further our very own Cheif conducted a torture test on this weapon as well. You can check out the Caracal Club or directly Youtube to find links of both.\n\nThis handgun was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who at one time was part of the Glock team and later joined Steyr to develop models M and S with them and Caracal F is his final design\n\nCaracal F holds 3 extremely tough and stringent certifications which only a few handgun manufactures such as Glock or Sig hold. Again you can check out the details of these on their website\n\n\n\n[B]Cons:\n[/B]This gun is not for you if you don''t handle it like a professional. It comes without any Manual Safety. However it does have the 3 Safeties which are Trigger Safety, Drop safety and firing pin safety. But if you pull the trigger on a cocked gun, it''s gona shoot and ain''t nothing gona stop it..\n\nThere has been an optional recall called on Caracal F''s due to doubt in drop safety functionality. You can read details on their website\n\nThis gun comes with 2 sight Options. Quick sight (QS) and Straight 8 or 2 dot sights. The QS are excellent for short range follow up shots but do not have satisfactory results with slightly increased distances so no fun at the range. Straight 8s or 2 Dot sights are excellent sights but they may require some time getting used to', 1, 1, '110.93.196.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0);

A real Value For Money IMHO) ...........\nIn Pak its around 40,000-45,000 depending on area/ dealer, bargaining etc. Again prob the cheapest exported 9mm with good reputation and reliability.\n\nIf you just want A pistol and want a cheapie with good performance then NP22 is a real Value for Money. If you want abit of a show Off Piece and want to spend extra then TP9.\n\nIn my Opinion: At this stage. Considering a rough and tough SD/HD scenario or situation I''d personally trust and prefer NP22 more..... (thats my Opinion, No offence to the TP9 lovers). Others may disagree.......[/QUOTE]\n\nNO offense taken :) however, hearsay and experience are two different, and often opposite things! :)\n\nFor one thing, the TP-9 only has a decocker, and no other safety mechanism... this is absolutely fine by me since I would feel uncomfortable knowing there are knobs and levers on my gun which might have to be manipulated before firing it, and which can be the precious time difference between life and death.\n\nsecondly, even though the trigger has a creep in it right out of the box, once the TP-9 is broken in (approx 250-300 rounds) the trigger smooths out, as did mine.\n\nit swallows and spits out whatever ammo you give it :) the high quality and world renowned Mec-Gar magazines ensure zero FTF too.\n\nHowever, the key is to keep an immaculately clean and spotless gun, well lubricated and functioning at all times. Even the best gun in the world will malfunction if it has a grimy barrel and/or slide etc.\n\nI have dropped my TP-9 in dust, on gravel and concrete and the magazines lick the earth regularly during every range session, ofcourse they are all cleaned thoroughly after each use.\n\nPolymer frames are tougher and longer lasting than steel and give the added peace of mind when it comes to rust issues.\n\nHaving stated the obvious facts, I will agree that it all depends on personal choice and comfort. A few of my friends hate the look, feel, weight and functioning of my gun and claim it to seem like a plastic toy :) \n\nGood luck to you in whatever you decide to get :)', 1, 1, '119.30.126.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Looks wise ur friends may nt like the tp9 but I prefer the TP9 over the NP and I''ve always fancied the striker pistol and find em more attractive. However not in all cases as it has to be performance and the looks together. Canik is a good turk brand. Unlike the the Ghost TR01/02. The reason I''d prefer the NP22 is due to it being value for money. I personally carry a stoeger cougar currently but just want something extra for abit of rough carry bcos where we live in Pak it can get abit dusty and also it fell got mucky scratched etc then ot probably won''t bother me as much.  Just want a reliable rough n tough cheapie. Lol. Thnx for ur share.', 1, 0, '178.239.90.8', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I had made a couple of suggestions to Caracal about the recall and otherwise and they invited me to their factory / head office in Abu Dhabi today to discuss things further. \n\nIt was a fruitful 2 hour long meeting and they were kind enough to have all the top management of Caracal attend including the GM of Caracal Mr. Sultan Aouda, marketing and production heads among others.\n\nI communicated all our concerns in person and made it clear the Khan brothers are quite decent guys (and personal friends of mine) and were looking for nothing more than an apology for being termed as blackmailers and frauds while they were on the right. As far as the recall is concerned I made it clear that a lot of us are anxious to get replacement guns ASAP as for some they are the only defensive weapon they own and till the company replaces it they cannot defend themselves confidently. They assured me that they are doing their best to make the replacement process as quick as possible. I apprised them about the complexities of a recall in Pakistan and suggested the best ways forward. Although they have not given me any time frame commitment they are hopeful that the recall should start soon.\n\nThere was some post on the forum and the issue raised at the Karachi GTG about certain Caracal C serial numbers guns being replaced while others are not. I raised this point with them and reminded them that we were promised an ''unconditional'' recall of ALL Caracal C''s via their letter and we are looking forward to just that. They said they were committed to the promise of unconditional recall of ALL C''s in Pakistan.  \n\nOne of my main suggestions was the formation of a centralized customer service/complaint department. Hopefully in the future all complaints will be handled by Caracal staff themselves instead of distributors which will go a long way in increasing the quality of customer service. Also after the recall we might see service centers and spare parts availability in Pakistan. \n\nMany other points were raised and discussed in detail. Caracal seems to be a forward looking company and once the recall is underway InshAllah PakGuns and Caracal both look forward to a close relationship. \n\nThe G.M, Marketing and Production heads assured me that they are now quite aware of our concerns and it''s a priority for them.\n \nLots of talk has been done, now let''s wait and watch the quick & practical implementation of the steps discussed today and before.', 1, 0, '94.203.220.121', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

However from the description you are giving of your self, when ever you go Gun Shopping, do look consider Viking and Caracal F.... If you are looking for something which is a bit more concealable yet gives a decent performance at range, you might consider a Stoeger Cougar, that gun has a fairly decent grip as well for big handed people...\n\nYou may consider and conduct further research on all of the above mentioned guns...\n\nMy Personal Preference is Caracal F...Why..? Well below is an analysis\n\n[B]Pros:[/B]\nAn extremely crisp trigger without any creep (4 pound constant trigger as compared to a 5.5 pound Glock trigger). Without any bias, IMHO, this gun has the most crisp trigger as compared to all of the above mentioned\n\nLow Bore Axis: which results in extremely low recoil and excellent for follow up shots. Again amongst all the above mentioned, this gun recoils the least\n\nExtremely Accurate and this is not just a personal observation. Almost all those who have shot with a Caracal F agree upon this.\n\nThis point is probably an extension to the point mentioned above. Caracal Fs come with a 4.1 inch barrel which is longer than most of the regular handguns. However Pt92s come with a 5 inch Barrel.... a longer barrel results in more accuracy and range but any weapon with too long a barrel might become problem to conceal\n\nThe gun is Polymer made and weights only 750 grams as compared to its counter Rival Glock 17 which weights 650 grams.. However all of the above mentioned handguns weigh more than Caracal.\n\nCaracal has extremly slim profile (Even slimmer than Glocks) which again makes them comparatively easier to conceal\n\nThe Full size Caracal F is slightly shorter than the Full size Glock 17 and just slightly longer than the Sub Compact Glock 19 which again supports in its Conceal\n\nCaracal F holds 18 Rounds, None of the above mentioned guns including Glocks hold that much fire power\n\nA Torture test was conducted by Armi on Caracal Fs. They shot 5000 rounds within 92 minutes through this gun without any failures. Further our very own Cheif conducted a torture test on this weapon as well. You can check out the Caracal Club or directly Youtube to find links of both.\n\nThis handgun was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who at one time was part of the Glock team and later joined Steyr to develop models M and S with them and Caracal F is his final design\n\nCaracal F holds 3 extremely tough and stringent certifications which only a few handgun manufactures such as Glock or Sig hold. Again you can check out the details of these on their website\n\n\n\n[B]Cons:\n[/B]This gun is not for you if you don''t handle it like a professional. It comes without any Manual Safety. However it does have the 3 Safeties which are Trigger Safety, Drop safety and firing pin safety. But if you pull the trigger on a cocked gun, it''s gona shoot and ain''t nothing gona stop it..\n\nThere has been an optional recall called on Caracal F''s due to doubt in drop safety functionality. You can read details on their website\n\nThis gun comes with 2 sight Options. Quick sight (QS) and Straight 8 or 2 dot sights. The QS are excellent for short range follow up shots but do not have satisfactory results with slightly increased distances so no fun at the range. Straight 8s or 2 Dot sights are excellent sights but they may require some time getting used to[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you for such a wonderful review. I am obliged to you for your honest effort you put in especially for me which also will benefit all. It took me a month to be able give my opinion on two guns :), not because of any lethargy but busy schedule only. Keeping the progress you guys can imagine how long will it take for me to get to know and digest about above :). BTW Before PG I only know TT and I am of the view its the King of all small arms.\n\nAbout to apply for a license and meanwhile , I am thinking to get started with the research on above guns + my own chosen one as well. \n\nI surely will post my queries here if I have or my opinion for soft critics once I am done.', 1, 0, '182.178.3.200', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

When I began my search for a 9mm handgun a month ago the only handguns I knew about were Glocks, Taurus, Walther, Beretta and S&W. Through this community I was introduced to Stoeger, Canikk, Zastava, Sarsilmaz, Baikal, Caracal and most importantly CZs. \n\nAfter much contemplation I ended up buying a CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow and again through this awesome community I found out that there was in fact a problem with the first piece that I got - promptly had it replaced as suggested by some kind members. Also got a good rate on the gun and licence issuance/conversion compared to what I would have paid as an uninformed buyer.\n\nFollowing the PG tradition, I would like to share pictures of the beginning of my new-found fascination with firearms. Please forgive the poor quality of pictures as I am new at this.\n\nThe Shadow\n\nI''ve bought this gun primarily for HD and also for range shooting, which I have not had the chance to do yet due to the turbulent situation in Karachi and mostly due to lack of free mornings.\n\nThe Walther\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21221[/ATTACH]\n\nThis gun was a gift from someone who had bought it in 1990s; do not know the exact manufacturing year but it has < 100 rounds through it. I plan to make this my EDC once I have fired around 2-300 rounds through it and gotten comfortable with handling a firearm.\n\niA plan on expanding my collection once the means are available, but the first objective is to fire 1000+ rounds at the range to get an idea of what "shooting" entails.\n\nOnce again, thank you all for being an extremely helpful and supportive community.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nCongrats on the Shadow bro.

Lets do some calculations and sketch out a good weapon out in your options. \nYour revised budget is 150k for shotgun and upto 300k for a rifle. Total = upto 450k and if I am not wrong you can pull it upto 500k.\n\n\nIf you want a good Shotgun and a Good rifle. I would recommend get a combo of 250k each and you will never regret. From hearsay I know that Remington model 700 is around 250k. You should search the market if its available at that range and if yes, you will love it I am sure. :)  Get one in a caliber you like the most,..  if you like target shooting more then hunting then get yourself a .308 for cheap ammo.  But if you want something highly reliable for your very lovely trophies, I love the 7mm Remington Magnum the most and it is this caliber which made the Remington model 700 one of the most popular rifle in the world. But you can go to other options, I think Remmy 700 comes in various calibers including .30-06 , 270, 243 and maybe 308. [b] For shotgun[/b] Get a good beretta Semi Auto. I can suggest Urika 391 or similar as experts can guide you here. It will serve you efficiently in hunting, and make you feel good on on occasional breaking clays !    Also at 250k.     1 option explained with a total cost of around 500k and a lifetime guarantee of happiness with these two :) \n\nSecondly, for rifle Winchester Model 70 also is around 200k, search the market for the updated prices. Combination with the beretta Shotgun. But lemme tell you a semi auto shotgun serve you best in hunting and club sports, but is not a good option for HD often.\n\nThirdly, the CZ rifles are at boom these days. CZ550 comes in various calibers as well from .308 to 7mm Rem Magnum too. But I think the price is on high end. Around 400-500k. I also heard a friend got his at 350k but the prices always fluctuate.  You should plan a market visit preferably at Lahore. Yes you can match up a high end CZ550 rifle with a low price but equally reliable Russian made Baikal Mp153 semi auto shotgun. \n\nHope that I have not confused you more  !', 1, 0, '111.92.134.221', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I wondered why anyone didnt try the hollow point of .22lr at a hunting or a sd level? i am a proud user of .22lr hollow point bullets.

I just kept watching them, cos of tinted windows, somehow they couldnt watchme back and i was. However, this kept on carrying on and i kept on watching on their moves, a guy with another bike handed over something to them, wierd situation with a wierd gesture of visitors, i send my gaurd loaded, and asked him to enquire the issue, the guys just said they are just out of petrol and waiting for their friend to refuel them. I was was curious to know. I was all ready to intercept these crooks when something caught my mind.

On the  return , I stopped by a improvised set up just besides the road,  where  local cold  drink of &#8220;Thadhal&#8221; was sold . . As I stopped by and was waiting for  my drink to be served , a lame man came to greet me , but I didn&#8217;t  recognized him .\nDon&#8217;t you recognize me , sir , he said \nsorry , i cant . i replied\nSir I am &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. He told his name ,  You arrested met years ago at &#8230;. , I used to trap falcons.\nO yes &#8230; now I remember you  ,  What happened to you , you were not lame  than as I remember , do you trap falcons still  , I said.\nNo sir I don&#8217;t now . My both legs were broken in that work ( trapping  falcons) . so I am not able to do that work now, This is my setup , I  use to sell thadhal in summer and do something else in winter . I have  left that cruel work now , perhaps my legs were broken as punishment to  the cruelties I did to those innocent birds . \nI had a chat with him while finishing my drink , forcibly paid him the  amount as was willing to have that drink free  as a sign of goodwill and  proceeded to my destination. \nWhile on the way , I remembered the entire episode how we met  years ago.\nI was waterfowling  with my buddies that time and after finishing the  early morning shoot, we came out of the hide, gathered the kill of each  gun at one place and were resting under nearby trees enjoying the mugs  of coffee from the flasks that we brought . Suddenly I spotted a falcon  having some bird in its claws in sky . I pointed it to my friends who  saw it too. But soon we observed that the flight of the bird was  irregular/abnormal. The bird was losing height and fell at some distance  from us. Out of curiosity , we ran to bird to see what happened . one  of my friend found the bird and call us to see. It was a terrible scene .  The poor bird was in miserable state. Its tiny eyes were gouged out .   The skin and feathers of some bird were wrapped around a little ball of  nylon net and that ball of net was stitched mercilessly  to the claws  and legs of the bird to give the impression that it is having a prey.  The bird was a local species of eagle that is locally called &#8220; Laggar&#8221;  or &#8220; Chukki&#8221;. As we were talking about as what actually was all that,  some people approached us on a jeep . None of them seemed to be local  except one who was driving the vehicle. They asked about the bird and  claimed it to be theirs . I asked about the miserable condition of the  bird and who done that to such an innocent creature . A guy who appeared  to be the   leader told that they have deliberately done that to the as  they were trapping the falcons to be sold in black market . when we  asked what is the connection of the miserable condition of the bird with  their work of trapping the falcons , he replied that they firstly catch  the  little local falcon called &#8220;Laggar&#8221; and take out its eyes by  poking some pointed thing like screwdriver etc  in its eyes and than  stop bleeding by applying ash to the wound of the bird. Afterwards , the  wrap some piece of skin containing feathers of a teal to the ball  shaped nylon net and stitch it in to the legs and claws of the falcon  and throw it in the air \n. The poor blind bird fly directionless  in the air and when it is  spotted by any Saker Falcon or Peregrine Falcon or any other falcon  which these cruel men want to catch, it attacks the little defenseless  blind bird and tries to snatch the prey from its claw , not knowing that  it is a bait. As that Saker Falcon or Peregrine Falcon tries to  snatch the so called prey , its  claws are badly stuck in that ball like net  and it ultimately drops on  the ground and is caught by those poachers who immediately blind fold it  . They also told me that they sell those Saker Falcon and Peregrine  Falcon for hundred of thousands rupees and if they just trap a single  falcon in entire season , their expanses are met with a handsome profit   .\nAnd what about  the poor birds you use to trap the falcon , I asked \nThe &#8220;Barak &#8221; dies , he replied calmly \nBarak is the term they use for the bait bird \nCutting long story short , on the next day , I summoned the  wildlife/game authorities in my office and conducted a raid on those  poachers. They all were arrested and luckily they haven&#8217;t been  successful in trapping any bird they were looking for. The period of my  posting in that particular area became a nightmare for the poachers and  they shifted their activities in the areas out of my jurisdiction \nToday when I saw that person limping, the legs of that little bird badly stitched with the net appeared in my imaginations.\n\n Than I thought what about the eyes of that innocent bird', 1, 0, '182.179.72.84', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

And even then i know of people who have to wait for 2 even 3 years before they get them... \n\nMore ever most licenses being issued are fake made in interior sindh. \n\nIn my humble opinion. Thinking about a gun before U have a license is kind of putting the cart before the horse. \n\nUp till last week I used to simply send people to dealers who handle such stuff. but now dealers have categorically stated that they don''t want people asking em to make licenses. So i am afraid i cant recommend U to anyone. \n\nHowever if u are in Dist east i do know some one in the DC office who might be able to help U out. But even he charges 22k for a back dated manual license which will sooner or later have to be converted to computerised one. for an additional charge. \n\nYour best bet is to wait it out till the new govt. comes in and sets its policy regarding arms lics. \n\ni have been told by the dealers that they might open computerised ones soon.I.e in a couple of weeks time. And since u r 25 then it should not be a problem for u to get a computerised one. Once they re-open. meanwhile I would not advise U to go to the shops without a license.

Since I am a falconer, i.e a person who hunts with falcons, and have been doing so for the last twenty five years, please allow me to shed some light on your post. My 2 cents as some would say. \n\nWhat you witnessed that day was actually a "barak" in progress. This trapping method has been around for centuries. However, its proper application is not as crude as what you saw. The birds usually used for barak are lugger falcons (lugger)and white eyed buzzards (chukki/kooee/teesa/tee''a).\n\nFalcons, like all other birds of prey and predators are very territorial, especially the bigger falcons such as peregrines and sakers. So they do not take kindly to intruders, and less so one who is flying around with a kill in its talons. \n\nSo what the trappers do (here I am describing what the traditional trappers and not what money blinded ignoramuses do),  is they first catch a lugger or a chukki in a net using a desert rat as bait. Next they "seel" they birds eye using fine needle and thread. As cruel as it may sound, seeling, done right is a painless and harmless procedure. The bird is first immobilised in the silken straight jacket, and its head is held by one man while another lifts up the outer eyelid (birds have an inner and an outer eyelid), and passes a fine needle with a silken thread just below the edge of the eyelid where there are no blood vessels or nerves, the needle is then taken over the bird''s head and the other eyelid is also pierced in the same manner, and then both ends of the the silk thread are drawn up, thus pulling up its eyelids and almost closing them. A bird thus treated can see only in one direction, which is up. \n\n(Apart from trapping, seeling is also used by falconers, and nowadays, even by also by experienced avian vets in cases where birds need to be immobilised for treatment. A bird that cannot see, will sit absolutely calm, and therefore it less stressed, and thus less susceptible to hurting itself by crashing around, and due to immuno-suppression caused by stress. Furthermore, seeling when done right, causes no bleeding, not even a single drop of blood, and to unseel a bird, all one needs to do is to spray some cool water on the bird''s eyes, then cut off the top knot with a scissor and slowly pull the thread out). \n\nSo returning to the topic at hand, once the bird''s eyes are seeled, a decoy locally known as a  "khuddu" is tied to the bird''s legs. This khuddu is usually made of a quail or dove''s skins dried and then stitched in the shape of a pouch, into which then  a ball made of cloth scraps is stuff in. Then nooses made of horse hair are stitched into this cloth ball. \n\nWith the "barak" thus prepared, the trapper hides in a blind not too different from our duck shooting blinds. All the time he scans the sky for a peregrine or saker falcon. The moment he spots one, he very quietly casts out the barak from a window in the blind. Now since the barak bird with its partially seeled eyes can only look up, it flies up.  Here on its entirely a matter of luck. If the falcon (the wild one) is not hungry or if he is just passing through, he will ignore the barak. But if that bird is local in that area, they it will at once swoop down to teach the intruder a lesson. Firstly, the barak has invaded the other''falcon''s territory, and secondly, it has killed in that territory, (thats what the khuddu hanging from its legs signifies), and thirdly, and worst of all, it is advertising, to all and sundry that it has ousted the other falcon from its territory, (as that is what flying around with a kill in its talons signifies). \n\nThis territorial behaviour is the undoing of the saker/peregrine as its first swoops down on the barak lugger to drive it out of the area, and then tries to take its kill (the khuddu) from it. The moment it does that, its talons get ensnared in the nooses, and both birds comes spiralling to the ground. \n\nNow if the trapper is traditional one, he will quickly entangle both the birds and inspect his catch, if it is a good young peregrine or saker he will keep it, if it is an adult bird he wuill release it as these are not preffered for falconry. Then  he will turn his attention to the barak bird. First he will untie the ball from its feet, then he will unseel its eyes, and let it rest in the shade for a while. Then in the late afternoon he will feed the bird and release it, for that is the unwritten rule of trapping. The decoy is always released after being fed a full crop. \n\nHowever, in this era of unbridled capitalism and blind pursuit of monetary wealth, most traditional vlues and ehtos have fallen by the wayside. 90% of the falcon trappers nowadays are just in it for the money. They are not even traditional trappers for the most part. Thus hey have no respect for these birds or any birds for that matter. \n\nThe blame for this sad state of affairs lies squarely on our governments right from Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the 1970''s to his illustrious son in law till a few months ago. The worst in this regard, however, were Zia-ul-Haq and Musharraf. The former started the business of allotting entire districts to visiting foreign "dignitaries" and barring local hunters from even setting foot in those areas, to the latter(Musharraf) in whose era, the issuance of falconry licences to Pakistani falconers was arbitrarily and indefinitely suspended. Both these rulers violated the fundamental rights of Pakistani citizens as guaranteed in the Constitution of Pakistan. \n\nThese actions have effectively killed falconry in Pakistan. Now only a handful of falconers remain, all them victims of apartheid in their own homeland.', 1, 0, '182.178.25.68', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

What an appropriate usage of modern technology[/QUOTE]\n\nFalcons training to this day remains the same as it was 5000 years ago. The nature of the beast has not changed. What has changed  is the use of technology to locate falcons.   In the olden days, falconers used bells to locate their birds when they killed out of sight. Incidentally, the best falconry bells in the world were made a few craftsmen originally from Amritsar, but they had migrated to Lahore after partition. Those men are dead now, and with them their art. (I do have a pair of those bells left with me). \n\nThen in the 1970''s radio technology was adapted for use in falconry. This consists of lightweight transmitter being attached to the falcon''s leg or tail feather, and the falconer using a radio receiver and directional antenna to locate the bird. \n\nThe next development was the development of GPS trackers in the 1990''s. But these are not very popular for falconry, as they are very heavy and transmit data to a satellite which then transmits it back to a base station on earth, which then relays the data to the authorised user. This technology is very cumbersome and expensive to use. \n\nIn the late 1990''s GSM based trackers were also developed, but they are limited to area that have GSM coverage, and most deserts and uninhabitated places do not. So this techonology is also not worthwhile. \n\nThus radio telemetry remains the tracking technology of choice in falconry.  Im sure you have all read in the papers and heard on TV about how every winter the Indian Border Security Force sees "Pakistani Spy Falcons"  near the Rajastan border and shoots them. The ignorant fools don''t  know that these are just hunting falcons very radio transmitters affixed to them.

Currently I am trying to aquire more licenses. \n\nThing is the new govt. might slap a ban on all fresh licenses. or they might jack up the rates higher still .. i dont know!\n\nWhich is why I am trying to make as many licenses as i can. once I have my desired number i can simply walk into any shop and buy what ever i like and can afford. till I have a license it cannot be done. \n\nThe district south DC arms section is issuing licenses right now for around 18k or so.\n\nAs regards teh mini 06 unavailable chiefly cause its junk and CF nice gun and its 2nd gen. even better! \n\nhowever these are all moot questions since without a lic they wont even show U a weapon till u go with some1 they know and trust.[/QUOTE]\n\nYou know what Bro ED? The day i posted here , I was thinking that i shall just get an advise about the right gun and dealer and the next day i shall drive towards the dealer and shall buy the gun lol (just like buying a cell phone). Anyways , its great that i came across an expert like you. So bro ED , whats an interior sindh license? Are they a kinda fake? Would you recommend them? I am ready to spend 15k over it if you recommend it. is the south DC office issuing reliable ones? And yeah , i researched the guns a bit and it seems that CF is the right choice for me.', 1, 0, '110.38.47.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

No failures.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, I didn''t have any targets on hand, but had little trouble making plastic soda bottles dance at a distance of 15-17 yards :-p \n\nIn the short period that I''ve had this gun, the following things stand out:\n\n1. Fit and finish is definitely better than what I was expecting and compares favourably with the Taurus PT-92, Baikal Viking etc.\n\n2. The alloy frame makes it lighter than expected, but it doesn''t feel flimsy or "weak" at all.\n\n3. It is a big, chunky piece; not for those of you with smaller hands. I on the other hand find it (and the Sig P226) to be ergonomic Nirvana! :-p\n\n4. Feeds hollow-points reliably, but do remember to clean the gun thoroughly before shooting it the first time.\n\n5. The control lever and mag release are very stiff. Maybe they''ll loosen up over time, hopefully.\n\n6. The sights are readable under most circumstances (except under dim light) and target acquisition is pretty good.\n\n7. The DA trigger is pretty heavy, but SA isn''t bad at all in my opinion. \n\nOverall, at this price, I''d prefer it over the more expensive PT-92, Stoeger Cougar, Baikal Viking, and the Canik55 variants available here.
