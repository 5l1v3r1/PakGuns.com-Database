It took a bit of adjustment to get it to hang properly. The cylinder and butt tuck right in, and there is only slight movement if I bend over and pick something up, raise my arms over my head, etc. \n\nThe holster rides much further toward my back than the picture indicates. This is likely due to my "rotund" physique. Even though it''s a left-hand holster, it''s not easy to draw the gun left-handed; if I don''t want to spin around like a dog chasing its tail, I have to use my right hand to keep the holster from moving backwards away from my hand when I''m reaching for it. On the other hand, it''s very easy to pull the gun with my *right* hand. It sounds unlikely, but I just stick my elbow out, curl my palm up, and pull. Fortunately I don''t have any problem shooting right-handed at self-defense range.\n\nThe gun is a 2" revolver. The holster wraps around between the grip and the trigger guard, with a solid leather insert to hold the weight. The top of the holster, along the backstrap, is split like a clamshell holster, except the gap has elastic sewn into it. When you push the gun into the holster, the elastic stretches until the guard clears the leather insert. You can just yank the gun out, but a slight tilt will let it slide out easily. My wife wants me to wait a while before modifying the holster by adding a strap, so I''ll carry the gun with an empty chamber under the hammer until I see how the retention system fares against chair arms, guard rails, etc. The Taurus has a transfer bar, but I''m just a bit leery about looking down my own muzzle as the back of the gun hits concrete...\n\nIt takes both hands to holster the gun with this rig; a firm grip on both the gun and the holster while you work the trigger guard around into the pocket against the elastic and the stiff sides against the cylinder. I had figured as much before I ordered it, so it was no surprise.', 1, 0, '76.125.99.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The wide part of the harness over my collarbone tends to pucker up a bit, probably due to my shape. \r\n\r\nThe only real annoyance is fastening the seat belt. One of my cars has the newer-style belt with the buckle more or less underneath my right buttcheek, which is hard to manipulate even with just a T-shirt. With a coat, it''s much harder, and with the holster, harder yet. I managed to dislodge the gun from the holster while fighting the buckle. Getting the gun back in required some youtube-worthy contortions; it''s an awkward process while you''re wearing the holster, made more so by being buckled into the seat. Any bystanders would have wondered if I was having some kind of seizure.\r\n\r\nTwo of my other vehicles have seat belt extenders. I think I''m going to order one for this vehicle too. The belt is plenty long enough from the factory, but moving the buckle up where I can reach it would really be nice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unforseen feature of the upside-down holster is that it is immune to what I call the "Chee-To Effect." Back when I wore a belt holster on the job, the holster seemed to collect lint, dust bunnies, bits of food, and food-like substances such as chee-tos. Since the Nevada holster is upside-down, the only thing that can fall out is the gun...

Oh, yes, it was great being able to hoon around on the highway, but it sucked to ride in town.  It was heavy, cranky at low throttle settings, and had no storage space.  Well, I could take the seat off, and there was a spot in the tail housing you could jam something the size of a pack of cigarettes into, though you might have to crush it a little first.  A lot of times I''d take the car into town, because I needed to pick something up that wouldn''t fit into the tailbag that rode strapped across the seat most of the time.\n\n Many times, I would be sitting in traffic, trying not to get cramps in my left arm from the stiff clutch, wishing I still had the Kawasaki 90 that was my first bike, or the Kawasaki 175 I had after that.  Sure, not much good for the kind of thousand-mile road trips I could make on the big bike, but most of my miles were in town.  I don''t remember how many miles I put on the 90, but I put 32,000 miles on the 175 in a year and a half, which was probably more than I put on any other vehicle I''ve owned since.\n\n I''m never going to be able to do long rides on a big bike again, but I sure could rack up some miles on a little Suzuki like that.

Caracal USA is totally a different entity. It has been established through the research that there might been some potential fault in the Pistols which were sent to the USA. However, the research department still didn''t find any trace that any of those potential pistols were shipped to pakistan. Still, as per the order of the Board the trained has traveled to pakistan and inspecting randomly some pistols which have been sent to Pakistan. Even if there is no trace still our majority of the board is in favor to replace the part on all pistols delivered in pakistan to make sure that all Caracal customers can sleep with peace.

We both like the one 2 seater CJ7 model, CJ5 is ok too but not sure if it can take a 3000cc petrol engine and transmission with aircon and heater fitment.\n\nMajority have advised to get one from army auction but ISB plate is a must as we live in ISB. And the same have suggested to take it to Peshawar to get everything including engine, interior and full suspension and 4WD system fitted - a coaster and pajero parts. Been told that someone in Pindi also prepares these jeeps. \n\nSourcing the chassis (an original jeep) and the right parts is the main issue (from very reliable and not conmen) that fit are main issues for me. Once the right parts including a solid engine and 4WD system including full suspension are in hand, getting it all fitted with excellent work is something I can manage with a right mechanic, denter, electrician and painter and have no issues getting my hands dirty in the process too, in fact prefer to be fully involved in the build it so I know it is done properly without cutting any corners, and to do it right first time around instead of fixing all sorts of problems later.\n\nWould really appreciate some pointers and pitfalls to avoid. And if anyone can help direct in sourcing a a straigh chassis jeep and parts from highly recommended source that would be great help.\n\nWe want the following:\n- Powerful Petrol engine (3000CC+ will be fine too), 4WD transmission and suspension that can handle the output of the engine without any hiccups\n- Airconditioner - a must\n- Heater - a must\n- most are fitted with Pajero dashboards so that or some other option if available?\n- chassis strengthening and roll bars\n- front seats (off any new''ish 4x4 like Cygnus etc) with custom doors, and waterproof zip up top covering full rear.\n\nI''m sure some of our hunting PG brothers own or have driven such custom jeeps.\n\nAny direction and advice is appreciated as this project will start as soon as our second car (barely used Nissan March) is sold.[/QUOTE]\nPak Wheels has dozens n dozens of restoration threads covering all these aspects, i would one day go for a 4X4 project whenever i get the funds :) .... but if u intend to keep it and use it as a 4x4, u shud get it restored urself.', 1, 1, '39.47.225.232', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Yes its polymer, yes at times it feels alien in the hand, yes the trigger isn''t the greatest and my god are the the factory sights unbearable but breaking it down tonight I couldn''t help but notice and admire one thing about the Glock, Its simplicity.\n\n[IMG]http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3719/10944863095_55cb1a7885_c.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI know there''s more to it than just a frame, a slide and the barrel + recoil guide rod assembly but looking at the Glock broken down you cant help but wonder how this thing even stays together when firing. There are no levers, safeties or decocking doodads to break the lines and as simple as this gun is mechanically it [I]looks[/I] even more plain jane than how it works. And therein lies the crux of the matter, beneath the boring, bland and frankly ugly exterior of the glock lies a raging monster that rewards patient students with a sound ferocity and deadlines equal to many if not all of its competitors. Its not a forgiving handgun and any mistake on your part is sure to disappoint and frustrate you but get it all right grip, breathing, trigger control, follow through and man oh man does the gun reward you by punching holes  within holes.  Is it for everyone no, is it the only gun I like hell no, I love my CZs I love shooting my friends SIG and i find the Beretta 92fs down right gorgeous but there is no other gun that surprises or rewards you like a Glock, I can attest to that it surprises me every time I shoot it.\n\nOh also before I put it away\n\n[IMG]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7292/10944965495_d8dc326d52_c.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe advantage arms conversion kit, ammo limits aren''t an issue here like in Pakistan (boooooooooooo) but ammo and its costs are a bane on shooters everywhere. If you like Glocks you know how important trigger time is as the trigger is very different from anything else. The advantage arms kit lets you practice trigger control for cheap and has greatly improved my shooting with centre-fire ammo.

So I went off looking at slings, and as so often happens, wandered off into the Land of Confusion.\r\n\r\n First off, what is now called a sling is what used to be called a "shooting sling"; often a three-strap arrangement designed to stabilize the rifle for shooting, as opposed to carrying.  What I knew as a "sling" is now a "carry strap."\r\n\r\n All that would be fine, except no two manufacturers seem to agree which is which, and they may sell apparently-identical products as one or the other.\r\n\r\n I was wondering where I should put the sling swivels.

Well, the "where" is what I''m trying to find out...\r\n\r\n The rifle I''m working with is a sporterized SMLE.  I could duplicate its sling, er, strap mounts... but I haven''t figured out whether the factory setup was optimized for carrying the rifle or for shooting it; the British rifleman''s manual shows wrapping an arm through the sling to steady the rifle, but you can do that with any sort of strap.\r\n\r\n I haven''t even found anything about how long the sling has to be; most pictures show the strap rigged tightly, but it looks like you''d want the sling to arch over your shoulder so the rifle is hanging, as opposed to a shorter strap, which would pinch the barrel against your shoulder.\r\n\r\n I can figure it out eventually, and the ugly stock won''t be damaged by a few trial-fit holes, but it''s strange that there''s so little information on mounting and rigging a sling.

Your comments are very helpful and encouraging in terms of FTE and has further strengthened my personal understanding.\n\nThe FTE was not the one in which the case remained sitting in chamber - it moved - it came close to partial ejection - the SLIDER moved about 1/2 inch - case was visible in EJECTION PORT. I removed the magazine and as soon as I moved the slider backward the case fell out.\n\n2. I have three videos. The first one with FTE, the only part that my partner captured was SLIDER in 1/2 inch backward state. Videos were essentially to show the rapid fire. But anyways I will try to load this movie also.\n\n3. I am going to make sure to fire 300 rounds in near future now - to get over the break in phase.\n\n4. From field performance, being first hand observer, discussion feel like that OIL was the main culprit. So this will be always now be my point of concern.\n\n5.

No more words to agree more than 100% to B-King.

Everything revolves around probability; chances of occurrence of something. BUT this does not inherently means that ALL engineering products (guns, cars, machines etc.) have SAME PROBABILITY OF FAILURE. [U]NO this is not true[/U]. BEST engineered products would have the LEAST Probability of failure and badly engineered or poorly engineered or non-engineered products would have very high rates of failures.  Comparisons should always be made under SIMILAR conditions.\nFollowing parameters would ensure least probability of failure:\n\n1. Good design (Designer''s responsibility)\n2. Good craftsmanship (manufacturer''s responsibility)\n3. Good habits of using it (User''s responsibility; ensuring that user is operating it under the parameters of designer)\n4. Good maintenance (user''s responsibility and to some extent seller''s/supplier support in providing good support of their product)\n\nAny thing wrong in above - disaster SHOULD be expected ANY time - like B-King has shared with us!\n\nI have already spoken a great deal on TOLERANCE in some of the post.

Imagine an airline that has only first class seats and provides first class service, but, they charge economy prices. How popular would they be? Now if they did everything the same, but increased the price five times, what makes them any different from other companies offering first class accommodation for first class prices?\nPakistan''s market is unique, but if Glocks cost $1500 elsewhere (or imagine them selling for 1,000,000rupees in Pak) that throws the whole equation out the window, and they would not enjoy a fraction of the popularity they do today.

I know mag dumps are fun, but you would be better served shooting only as fast as you can stay on target. Begin with double taps, and then move on to controlled three round bursts, aka Mozambique drill (two to the chest and one to the head).\nSecond, watch your grip in the video. Notice how your support hand starts off next to your firing hand, and then ends up below it. Pay attention in the video of how your shots stray further and further from the target, as your grip shifts. \nThird, I''m surprised a doctor of all people, doesn''t use hearing protection when shooting![/QUOTE]\n\nLOL :) \n\nFirst of all thank you sir for taking out time and commenting on ALL issues. I do notice the grip issue. It was good in the last pratice but not good this time. I will surely pay attention to it.

Not “game” as in the classic sense of an elegantly understated British side-by-side, but something resembling what a Civil War-era press agent — in describing the Spencer Carbine — referred to as a “horizontal shot tower.” In other words, a delivery system for quickly putting as much birdshot, buckshot or slugs downrange to allow you to smack stuff down faster than the other guys.\n\n\nNow we have the Beretta 1301 Competition. And make no mistake about it, in terms of dealing with plates or steel silhouette targets — or even aerial ones — this competition/tactical smoothbore might be the optimum tool for the job. It’s fast indeed, featuring a rotating bolt and revamped — and simplified — gas operation comprising the Blink system (which premiered on the A400 a couple of years back). Beretta claims that you can fire four shots in a second with it (I came kinda close to that but didn’t have a timer to verify).\n\n\nThe specimen we got in featured a 21-inch barrel with a full-length extended magazine tube. A 24-inch-barrel version is available for those who prefer, but if we had our druthers, we’d stick with the shorter one.\n\n\nThe most noticeable aspects of the 1301 are the oversize controls — bolt handle, bolt release and crossbolt safety button (reversible for lefties). The bolt release consists of a large, serrated tab right below the ejection port. It’s very quick to access from under the receiver with your support hand (assuming you’re right-handed). One caveat: If you’re carrying the gun with the bolt locked back, do not grasp the receiver over the top. You may get a nasty surprise if an errant finger trips that oversize release (yes, I did discover that the hard way).\n\n\nThe “oversize theme” of the 1301 is continued in the large ejection and loading ports. In competition, reloading speed is as important as “hitting the target” speed. And anything that helps out there, and saves your thumb from abuse in the process, is a good thing, as anyone who has ever been on a dove hunt in Argentina can tell you.\n\n\nThe synthetic stock is short, but has an adjustable length of pull (13 to 141/2 inches). The texturing is more than aggressive enough for a nonslip grip. The 1301 does not come with ghost-ring or open, rifle-type sights, just a large, red, fiber optic front and a midbead on a wide, sporting-type rib. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a rail mount, as some 3-Gun guys may want to modify the gun for Unlimited and put an Aimpoint Micro or something similar on it.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26650[/ATTACH]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]The 1301, incidentally, handles [URL="http://www.a400xcel.com/optima-bore-hp-a400-xcel/index.aspx?m=53&did=158"]Beretta’s Optima Bore HP [/URL]choke system, although only one tube — a flush-fit Cylinder bore — was included. We did have another Cylinder-bore tube — an extended one threaded to accept Beretta’s Breacher attachment, which adds a certain “tacti-cool” intimidation factor (and could come in handy if you inadvertently lock yourself out of the house).[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]The first order of business with the gun was to shoot a couple of rounds of skeet with it. So [I]“[URL="http://www.wildfowlmag.com/"]Wildfowl[/URL]” [/I]editor Skip Knowles and I took it out to the nearest clay target venue (Peoria Trap and Skeet) and were very impressed with the gun. Recoil — as to be expected with 23/4-inch target loads — was very gentle, thanks to the gas system, generous recoil pad and seven (well-distributed) pounds of weight. Our scores ran from 24 to 21. And since neither of us would be much of a threat on the local skeet circuit, we were pretty pleased.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]I’d done a bit of shooting with slugs out of rifle-sighted (ghost ring and open) smoothbores and was pretty curious as to how I’d fare with that large fiber optic front bead. I put up a large Shoot-N-C target at 25 meters and settled down at the bench. Since shooting slugs from a bench can be less than pleasant, I was a bit apprehensive, as always. I had on hand some 11/8-inch [URL="http://ddupleks.com/index.php/en/1270-cal/hexolit-32.html"]Dupleks Hexolit32[/URL] slugs, along with some 11/8-ounce [URL="http://www.winchester.com/products/rifle-ammunition/Advanced/Razorback-XT/Pages/default.aspx"]Winchester Razorbacks[/URL]. Both were 23/4-inch loads (the rationale for a three-inch slug load is totally beyond my understanding). I used the big front bead to make a figure 8 with the target and started shooting. I was gratified by the very manageable level of felt recoil — significantly less jarring than an inertia gun and infinitely less so than any pump.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]I was even more surprised by the groups. The Winchester stuff gave me a three-shot cluster just under an inch and a half and only slightly left of my point of aim. The exotic-looking Hexolit32 stuff came in at about an inch more, also shading to the left. One contributing factor may have been the 1301’s nice trigger, which broke at a crisp four pounds. I tried some [URL="http://www.hornady.com/ammunition"]Hornady[/URL] NobelSport Law Enforcement 00 buck (12 pellets) at 12 yards and managed to keep all of them in a fairly well-distributed 10-inch circle. Before I’d settle on any buckshot load, though, I think I’d want to try some other choke tubes — and other buckshot sizes — for a bit of mixing and matching. Buckshot’s kind of funny that way, particularly when you start stretching the envelope range-wise.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=georgia]Beretta’s 1301 Competition appears to be just what its name implies, although it would make an awesome defensive tool in less regimented circumstances. And I happen to think it’s a pretty good skeet gun as well.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Helvetica Nueue]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26651[/ATTACH][/FONT][/COLOR][/quote]', 1, 0, '119.155.10.102', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I also love Sigs even more than you.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nI understand what you mean, but it''s different when you talk about a natural resource, compared to a man made product. There''s no replacement for mangoes, and if they can''t grow in England, they have to pay for them to come from afar. The thing with Glocks however, is that they are not a unique item. There are replacements for them, in other quality guns, that sell for reasonable prices. Another thing with manufactured products is that there is a fixed cost to produce, and accordingly a fair price to retail. That''s why there are MSRP''s in any regular market around the world where Glock does business.  Because they know, that consumers know, what a fair price is, and inflating it unreasonably would detract from the image, ethics, and culture that Glock promotes, as a responsible corporation in the firearms industry. Normally a gun store makes a decent profit charging the equivalent of around $500 for a new Glock. So even if we grossly exaggerate, and say in Pakistan dealers charge $500 for the gun with profit, $500 for shipping with profit, and $500 for duty with profit, that still leaves $1000 of pure profit, just for the hype! It obviously makes no difference to me, but I take issue because it''s disconcerting in a moral sense, knowing these exorbitant prices are being charged. What''s worse, the very people who are being ripped off have been conditioned to think that those costs make sense and are fair market value, to the point of actually defending the pricing strategy of the dealers/scammers.  \nBut the bottom line is, I''m an outsider looking in.

First of all I am very happy to read a very, very positive discussion on PROS and CONS; ones like vs others contrary opinions - I congratulate ALL the PG members - this is what we need. This broadens the thinking of others as well - we can judge both sides on a very technical issue in a fierce technical debate. :)\n\n2ndly my personal opinion is based on a technical FACT. If one product is costing some company say US500 then it&#8217;s worth is no more than $500! I do consider the argument that mass production and intelligent techniques of production of one company may bring the price down while keeping no compromise on quality BUT question is DO others don&#8217;t have those? How can we prove that Mercedes Benz is not better than a similar BMW? Not possible to prove! One will have a feature better than other BUT the other will have another feature better than the first!!! Now the question would be answered by the BUYERS only!\nWell, certainly Glock&#8217;s are nice products! If two comparable pistols are taken say $500  Glock and any other &#8211; then same debate of Benz and BMW is applicable!\n\nFinally the question is PRICE!!!! Now to me right now we have two schools of thought &#8211; [B]one taking into account the Price[/B] and [B]other not paying attention to price at ALL[/B].

But he offered me multiple NP 22s for the same rate.\n\nDuly inspired lunatix was kind enough to write down most of his inventory\n\nBaikal Viking (polymer frame) 67k\n\nCF 98 40k\n\nNP 42 44k\n\nNP 22 both with and without rail 42k (He said that it won&#8217;t be possible to sell at 40k from now onwards but he does respond to bargaining)\n\nNP 34 42k \n\nSalsimarz CM 9  68k\n\nKlinic 2000 65k\n\nZigana Sports 80k\n\nHe had a shooting gallery and we all took turns firing the weapon on both DA and SA modes. \n\nOur &#8216;hostage&#8217; had slipped away from Saddar Armoury now joined us at Mega armory. \n\nCaniks Shark C and full sized and Pirhana & C 100 (all for 68 to 72k approx) \n\nTauruses.  All popular models 78 to 82k Approx\n\nCZ Rami 118k Approx NIB\n\nCz Duty 92k (Negotiable)\n\nOther CZs available whose prices I forgot\n\nStoeger Cougar black without rails 72k \nStoeger Cougar Black used 80% 55k\n\n605 5 shot ss unported barrel .357 2 inch Taurus revolver (forgot price) \n\nLocal  TTs in AK shape asking 17k \n\nChinese Red box (on forum reference) 34 a pop\n\nS&B FMJ 9mm 58 a pop. No JHPs available as yet. \n\nNo .32 calibre ammo available\n\nThey also had some switch blades whose price I forgot to ask\n\nSkywatcher had only 39k on him and they handed the weapon over on the assumption that he will give the extra K next week. Which (God bless his soul) he did.\n\nDanial showed us printouts photos of the exploded Caracal along with the damage they had wrecked which he had downloaded from Pakguns. He said that he shows em to anyone who comes around asking for a caracal.\n\n(sigh) a fellow Caracal hater.... \n\nConclusion: If these guys continue to give me below market rates I won&#8217;t even &#8220;need&#8221; to do any more surveys.

What would your dad rather have, you or your bike? Ask yourself the same question. You got a long way to go you will earn and ride 20 better vehicles in your life.

My best friend was a hitman for a political party, even his CG 125 got snatched. His ego was shattered for a few days, but that is Karachi my friend! Don''t take it too seriously, just take good precautions. Also using a firearm in such a situation can have devastating results. A smart guy knows when NOT TO USE FORCE.

I know you are feeling insulted and trampled upon right now, but see if you can still read this message you came out of the situation a winner. I speak from experience, so let me tell you this that you will laugh at this story a few days from now. Time is a good healer. Also consider it sadqa for your life and safety. What would your dad rather have, you or your bike? Ask yourself the same question. You got a long way to go you will earn and ride 20 better vehicles in your life. Learn from your mistake, when I used to live in Karachi, we never displayed brand new motorcycles, we used to dab grease on mudguards and wrap the fuel tank with a cloth. No showing off. My best friend was a hitman for a political party, even his CG 125 got snatched. His ego was shattered for a few days, but that is Karachi my friend! Don''t take it too seriously, just take good precautions. Also using a firearm in such a situation can have devastating results. A smart guy knows when NOT TO USE FORCE. I personally have been robbed at gun point, I did not do anything silly because although I had a chance, it was a chance, it could have gone either way, but on the same note I have brought guys down to the ground when there was an imminent death threat to me and my loved ones. I am no champ, but I am still alive and that tells me that my decisions were right. With six robbers you were terribly out numbered and out gunned, I am glad that you were confused and it ended up saving your life. Also the TT round is high velocity and usually goes out the other side, hence does not have much knockdown power in my opinion, unless you hit a vital organ.\nPlease thank Allah for this chance and be a thankful person, trust me Allah will shower his blessings on you in return.

And these can be generalized to all high power air guns. I have been using air guns since my child hood. It''s been now more than 30 years. And from my personal experience I can second your observations. We should not expect power of a firearm from an air gun. Every technology has a limit. And these higher powered air guns are at upper end of the limit of this technology. To enjoy air gunning one should buy low or medium powered air guns like Diana 28 or 27. I prefer even Diana 24. They are light, easy to shoot, accurate, last longer, good for scope use, easy to maintain, have low noise, and safe. The above advantages of medium/low powered air guns are the very reasons one should opt for air gunning. If you want more energy then go for .22 rimfire rifles. People buy air guns and expect to kill deers or wild boars with them which is not the reality.[/QUOTE]\n\nbro ehalin, \nsearch for "hog hunting with Gamo hunter extreme" on youtube and you''ll see that the expectation has become reality..... :)\nI''m looking around for a D54AK if anyone has one for sale let me know....

We both like the one 2 seater CJ7 model, CJ5 is ok too but not sure if it can take a 3000cc petrol engine and transmission with aircon and heater fitment.\n\nMajority have advised to get one from army auction but ISB plate is a must as we live in ISB. And the same have suggested to take it to Peshawar to get everything including engine, interior and full suspension and 4WD system fitted - a coaster and pajero parts. Been told that someone in Pindi also prepares these jeeps. \n\nSourcing the chassis (an original jeep) and the right parts is the main issue (from very reliable and not conmen) that fit are main issues for me. Once the right parts including a solid engine and 4WD system including full suspension are in hand, getting it all fitted with excellent work is something I can manage with a right mechanic, denter, electrician and painter and have no issues getting my hands dirty in the process too, in fact prefer to be fully involved in the build it so I know it is done properly without cutting any corners, and to do it right first time around instead of fixing all sorts of problems later.\n\nWould really appreciate some pointers and pitfalls to avoid. And if anyone can help direct in sourcing a a straigh chassis jeep and parts from highly recommended source that would be great help.\n\nWe want the following:\n- Powerful Petrol engine (3000CC+ will be fine too), 4WD transmission and suspension that can handle the output of the engine without any hiccups\n- Airconditioner - a must\n- Heater - a must\n- most are fitted with Pajero dashboards so that or some other option if available?\n- chassis strengthening and roll bars\n- front seats (off any new''ish 4x4 like Cygnus etc) with custom doors, and waterproof zip up top covering full rear.\n\nI''m sure some of our hunting PG brothers own or have driven such custom jeeps.\n\nAny direction and advice is appreciated as this project will start as soon as our second car (barely used Nissan March) is sold.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear VERVE - the fact is every decision will have PROS and CONS. If you need to build your own jeep it will be the best options BUT as many dear PG members already said it will TAKE HUGE amount of time and efforts! But surely at the end of few days or week(s) you will get your desired jeep. One thing is for sure it will be very difficult to get a already built jeep 100% of your choice – so now depends if you are ready to live with that.\n \nI would suggest taking out time to visit Pinidi market and then Peshawar (you are welcome) – survey at both places and decide.  My feeling is some of things can be done best in Peshawar and some things might be required from Pindi. A very dear friend in army did the same. He bought a jeep from army auction, restored it here in Peshawar. He used the same engine so was difficult to find rings for the piston – best bet is to get a new engine as you are planning.\n \nOne big advantage of Peshawar would be lot of stuff coming from neighbor country thus easy to find at low cost. I know some good mechanics also. Let me know if you need to contact them.\n \nRegards', 1, 0, '182.185.123.37', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This incident took place on 29 November 2012. I live in North Nazimabad block L and didnt have any guard system in our street that time, the street was opened from both side and had 5 to 6 snatching during tht month. It was a very soft target for muggers those days.  \n\n\nThe day was just not good for me I had very bad feelings for unknown reason since the day started, at around 9 pm my wife and I went to visit a doctor as my son was having fever. I accidentally dropped my cell fone out my pocket when i stopped my car at a nearby store to buy something. and of course could not find it again more time was wasted in blocking the sim card and we came back from the clinic around 11 30, still there was strange feeling in my mind like that some thing''s gonna happen soon. I parked my car in Porch and went inside to drop some shoppers and bag of my son''s stuff and leave my gun on the table inside our my home. In the frustration of my cell fone I forgot my car key in the car and door were all locked. In the mean time my brother in law and sister came home and I tried to recover my car''s key with my brother in law. Suddenly I heard a gunshot I just take my head out of car and then heard some one is shouting and bang bang, two more shots fired, I told my brother in law to go inside and also ran inside my lounge, I took my handgun which was chambered and came out of my house (from the sound of shots I realize that they r not infront of my house they were at the other end of street, when I was running down the street I saw three men were firing aerial shots and were shouting too. and then I saw my father who was walking down the street towards me shouting (Maar diya, maar diya tum kahan ja rahey ho) when I asked he told me that he has been shot (my father) It really just made me out of mind I ran again towards them and fired multiple aerial shot to just scare them they escaped quickly, I came back to my father and checked him, he was shot in the GROIN area and was not feeling anything tht time may be due to the shock. we rushed him to Zia uddin hospital where doctors gave him treatment and we came back home the same night AL HAMDULILLAH he recovered quickly and the shot did not prove lethal. My father was not happy with decision of buying gun those days but after this incident he''s become softer about guns.. The next day a shop keeper at the end of street told me that there were 6 people on two bikes, one was inside your street and the other was covering them on main road, they looking for their pray and my father who was just having a walk after diner appealed them, when they were harassing him to handover his money or mobile, one them accidentally shot my father and after that they fire multiple rounds to eliminate their mistake but my father was lucky enough to jump in the garden of another house,  when I opened fire they all ran away insanely and nearly to slipped their bike and at the end of the main road near Mateen foods restaurant where they were stopped by police and had an encounter with the police and got arrested, my father did not see their faces so it was useless to go to police station.. \nAnd one more thing tht my father used to walk there along with my one and half year old son but because he was with us ALLAH SWT saved him that time other wise the gunshot to my father was barely of my son''s over all height..\nMay ALLAH keep all of us safe from such incidents.....\n(I am not a very good writer like ED bro and others so there would be some mistakes, sorry for that)', 1, 1, '39.48.236.104', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It all started almost 6 months back when I started looking for a PCP and after a lot of tamaktoyan, I decided upon Hatsan BT65 Elite (I am only kidding myself, the list is long, but all in good time, InshAllah. ). Now the challenge was, where to get one from?? Hmm a million dollar question. Well believe me, no stones were left unturned and almost all of relatives living abroad; every friend either coming to Pakistan or leaving; about half a dozen Customs officials; a sibling in Dubai; a PIA steward; several dealers of fire and not-so-fire arms; in short, for me it was like requesting a hefty portion of our country&#8217;s populace to help me out in this regard but all in vain. In between all this time there was one door which still needed knocking and that was Hira Arms Lahore, an importer of Hatsan in Pakistan. \n\nMr Nafees Malik, the owner was contacted and he informed me that his consignment will be reaching in two weeks&#8217; time. Frankly speaking, after that for another 6 months those &#8220;Two weeks&#8221; never came. But at the same time, I have to acknowledge the fact that the stated [I]wait-period [/I]decreased from weeks to days and then simply to hours. lol. To some of my partners in crime (identity will be disclosed later), I used to refer to Mr. Malik as [I]Mr. Dou-haftoon-main-a-jay-gi [/I]and a few more hyphenated names (nothing inappropriate :) ). Malik sb has a certain way of keeping his clients hooked, which from business POV may be a good idea but at the same time the strategy may backfire while dealing with hotheads like myself. Hahah. (I had to keep my cool as an Elite was at stake ;) ). So as it is said, &#8220;all is well that ends well&#8221; and yes, AT LAST in a state of WELL the whole waiting episode ended. The Elite reached Hira Arms and I heard the sweet symphony of Aap-ki-call-ka-intizar-tha. :D\n\nAt the moment, the gun is still in Lahore and is expected to reach me by the mid of the coming week so a pictorial review is in place, inshAllah. The identity of my partners in crime will be disclosed along with the detailed review, with their permission. The details about price etc will also be shared accordingly. \n\nThe rifle&#8217;s package includes the following items;\n·         3 Mags\n·         255cc cylinder (removable) with pressure gauge\n·         Mounted sling swivels\n·         An excuse for a Bipod. (Hatsan can do better than that, I am sure).\n·         A hard case. Its quality I am presuming to be very low. (Waiting till I see it in person).\n·         A sling\n·         A torch which can be installed on the picatinny rail. (Hatsan BT65 has three rails in its synthetic stock). Did I mention that I got the Synthetic stock with Thumbhole? No? Really? I guess that info fell through the cracks :).\n·         Optima 3-12x44 AO scope along with two piece mount.  (I may or may not change this scope but only after the Optima has been put to test).\n\nI also got myself a Hill Pump. The pump for the Hatsan will be reaching Hira Arms in the mid of the current month and I am sure it must be of good quality but I wanted to buy a reliable pump which can be used with any and almost all (with some alteration) the PCPs which are yet to land in my collection, InshAllah. So stay tuned and the range review will be posted very soon. For the time being please be content with the low resolution cellphone pics of the beast. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26795[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26796[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26797[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26798[/ATTACH]\n\nRegards and Ciao', 1, 0, '182.185.97.178', 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

This incident took place on 29 November 2012. I live in North Nazimabad block L and didn''t have any guard system in our street that time, the street was opened from both side and had 5 to 6 snatching during tht month. It was a very soft target for muggers those days.  \n\n\nThe day was just not good for me I had very bad feelings for unknown reason since the day started, at around 9 pm my wife and I went to visit a doctor as my son was having fever. I accidentally dropped my cell fone out my pocket when i stopped my car at a nearby store to buy something. and of course could not find it again more time was wasted in blocking the sim card and we came back from the clinic around 11 30, still there was strange feeling in my mind like that some thing''s gonna happen soon. I parked my car in Porch and went inside to drop some shoppers and bag of my son''s stuff and leave my gun on the table inside our my home. In the frustration of my cell fone I forgot my car key in the car and door were all locked. In the mean time my brother in law and sister came home and I tried to recover my car''s key with my brother in law. Suddenly I heard a gunshot I just take my head out of car and then heard some one is shouting and bang bang, two more shots fired, I told my brother in law to go inside and also ran inside my lounge, I took my handgun which was chambered and came out of my house (from the sound of shots I realize that they r not infront of my house they were at the other end of street, when I was running down the street I saw three men were firing aerial shots and were shouting too. and then I saw my father who was walking down the street towards me shouting (Maar diya, maar diya tum kahan ja rahey ho) when I asked he told me that he has been shot (my father) It really just made me out of mind I ran again towards them and fired multiple aerial shot to just scare them they escaped quickly, I came back to my father and checked him, he was shot in the GROIN area and was not feeling anything tht time may be due to the shock. we rushed him to Zia uddin hospital where doctors gave him treatment and we came back home the same night AL HAMDULILLAH he recovered quickly and the shot did not prove lethal. My father was not happy with decision of buying gun those days but after this incident he''s become softer about guns.. The next day a shop keeper at the end of street told me that there were 6 people on two bikes, one was inside your street and the other was covering them on main road, they looking for their pray and my father who was just having a walk after diner appealed them, when they were harassing him to handover his money or mobile, one them accidentally shot my father and after that they fire multiple rounds to eliminate their mistake but my father was lucky enough to jump in the garden of another house,  when I opened fire they all ran away insanely and nearly to slipped their bike and at the end of the main road near Mateen foods restaurant where they were stopped by police and had an encounter with the police and got arrested, my father did not see their faces so it was useless to go to police station.. \nAnd one more thing tht my father used to walk there along with my one and half year old son but because he was with us ALLAH SWT saved him that time other wise the gunshot to my father was barely of my son''s over all height..\nMay ALLAH keep all of us safe from such incidents.....\n(I am not a very good writer like ED bro and others so there would be some mistakes, sorry for that)[/QUOTE]\n\nLunatix brother i pray to Allah to protect you, your family and neighborhood from further mishaps and man you are a really braveman"Nar admai" with a kind heart.

Here''s why...\n Even though I''m a lefty, and the third gens only have right handed mag releases, I prefer that style of button over the wider and flatter gen4''s. Another thing is the grip texturing, although neither is perfect, with the gen4''s being too aggressive and the Gen 3''s not aggressive enough, my money still goes to the 3rd Gen for being more comfortable overall. Another thing with the grip is that the 3rd Gen SF is a perfect fit. Even though the 4th Gens have multiple back straps, I can''t seem to get it just right for my hands. Lastly i''m not a huge fan of the dual captured recoil spring. Irrespective of reliability, the ejection pattern with it is just not consistent enough in terms of distance and direction. Besides, Glock made their rise to fame using the original spring, and there was no need to change it!

It’s a really nice place. I mean seriously. We had gone there expecting to be disaponted. \r\n\r\nThe first thing we saw was an NP 22 with rails. Asking 45k.

Needless to say we came back..  We felt a bit guilty about leaving our ‘hostage’ at Saddar Armoury.

(Shafi bhai had said he ‘might’ be able to arrange an extra mag for 10k but no guarantees.)\r\n\r\nI was a bit mystified that the market was much higher and how come he was offering the NP 22 at these rates. He said they had not had a sale for a week. Thanks to the operation and ban on licenses. \r\n\r\nI thought it might be a used piece that he was trying to sell as NIB.

So here is my take on its cosmetics and features.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26906[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26903[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26904[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26905[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26909[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26912[/ATTACH][B][U]\n\nPackaging:[/U][/B]\nThe gun has good packaging and its protection has been ensured by the manufacturer as it comes in a double box. There is foam on all side of the box with very little space for the rifle to rest in once the scope is installed on it. The barrel and the cylinder both are clean and without any grazes. The quality of the gun case cannot be compared with a Plano however it is good enough for a casual traveler like me.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Double box packing is a very nice effort by the company which has ensured that the unit you receive is as scratch less as you would want a +600$ rifle to be.\n[B]Not: [/B]The hinges on the gun case could have been better.\n \n[B][U]Bipod[/U][/B]\nPlease remember, this rifle is heavy (almost 10 lbs with scope and accessories) and its most viable usage would be through a rest. The bipod which came with it is of poor quality, rather I would say it’s totally junk; no need of using it. I have an original Harris Engineering bipod which I may install on it. InshAllah.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Nothing about the Bipod can be termed as pros (On a second thought, I may use it on my Winchester Model 190 but more on that later)\n[B]Not: [/B]Don’t get me started.\n \n[B][U]Stock[/U][/B]\nThe ambidextrous stock on the Elite is synthetic with thumbhole. I was anxiously waiting for a synthetic version because I use my guns quite extensively and thus unlike wooden stocks; there is no fear of ruining the cosmetics with a scratch here and a graze there. The Hatsan felt great in my hands and shouldered very nicely. I had to make slight adjustment in the pull length as the factory setting was a bit short for me. As mentioned earlier, the stock is well finished and balanced and beyond what I expected out of it.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Due to adjustable nature of the shoulder recoil pad and the comb, this stock is supposed to be a perfect fit for shooter of every size.\n[B]Not: [/B]I am speechless so there are no NOTs.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26910[/ATTACH] \n \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26911[/ATTACH]\n[B][U]\nSling[/U][/B]\nThe sling is made of a so so quality fabric and the name HATSAN is embroidered on it. The quality of hooks on the sling can be termed as slightly-better-than-safety-pins. By the way, I have an old laptop bag (now torn from several places) which had a very well finished shoulder strap with cast-iron hooks. I guess that will look nice with the gun but lets see.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Naaaahhhhh.\n[B]Not: [/B]The sling is not getting hooked on the Hatsan anytime soon.\n\n(Stay tuned for Part 2 and 3) InshAllah', 1, 0, '182.181.182.165', 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I reckon, when I got hold of my Airking, I told a fellow PG member that the T06 trigger on this gun is amazing but I can’t resist the itch to mess around with its triple adjust settings. lol. However, saner minds prevailed J and I didn’t mess with it and left it at factory settings. The trigger of the Elite also feels nice but I am sure I will be able to comment better once I have used it on a range.\n[B]Hot: [/B]The gold platted trigger is beautifully finished and quite crisp with no creep whatsoever.\n[B]Not: [/B]Elite’s trigger still has to go a long way to compete with the Airking’s T06.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26915[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26914[/ATTACH] \n\n[B][U]Optical Sights[/U][/B]\nThe TruGlo fiber optic sights (front and rear) are nicely finished and have elevation as well as windage adjustments. But I could feel a few mm gap between the sides of the front and the rear one. To some users it may not be an issue but for me that’s something to which every user will have to get used to. I always prefer the sights with no gap on its sides.\n[B]Hot: [/B]The TruGlo fiber optics really glows, trust me. lol\n[B]Not: [/B]As Elite is termed as a very powerful gun and thus meant for long distance shooting with a scope so sights or no sights, fiber or no fiber, for me its all the same.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26916[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26917[/ATTACH]\n \n[B][U]Scope[/U][/B]\nThe scope provided in the package is Optima 3-12x44 AO. It is a sufficiently good scope and I am sure that it will suffice the needs of a normal user. However it won’t hurt if one tries out the Leapers 6-12x56 with it. Why I am saying that, only because I have one laying around gun-less. hahaha\n[B]Hot: [/B]A good scope with Adjustable Objective settings and illuminated cross hairs.\n[B]Not: [/B]Once the scope is installed on the rifle it doesn’t fit in the gun case. Yes that’s right, it doesn’t fit. There is no space left on the sides and the whole placement looks claustrophobic. I will have to get low profile mounts.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26918[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26919[/ATTACH] \n\n[B][U]The Bolt[/U][/B]\nThe bolt is chromed and is its mechanism is very smooth (for the time being). No significant cocking/bolting effort is required and I hope it remains that way.\n[B]Hot: [/B]I am glad that it’s the side bolt mechanism and the rear one. The rear one doesn’t seem real, but that’s me.\n[B]Not: [/B]I read several reviews of the Elite on international forums and only one commented that the bolt became stiff after some use.

I wanted to check this system and the pressure was at 170 bar. In a scenario where I lacked proper controlled environment, while standing on my roof top (with no one around me), I dropped the gun on its recoil pad facing upward from a height of 1 feet, nothing happened; then 2 feet and nothing happened and then … No you are not thinking straight now. lol. I didn’t drop it again after the first two tries. It really hurt in the upper left portion of the torso and I couldn’t bring myself to do it the third time.\n[B]Hot: [/B]The system works\n[B]Not: [/B]Its all the way hot :)\n \n[B][U]Safety Mechanism[/U][/B]\nI don’t know if from the POV of a bolt action rifle, the manual safety is a good idea or not but anyways I have been a fan of automatic safeties from day one. Because once you get used to it, the thumb automatically goes to the safety and disengages it as soon as the gunner has made up his mind to shoot. (At least that’s was what I used to do with my Baikal SxS and the Airking). The safety push-button has a little play in it and its gold platting is more like a golden paint. In short it has some space for improvement.\n[B]Hot: [/B]Not Hot.\n[B]Not: [/B]As mentioned earlier, the stock is ambidextrous however in a shooting position neither a left nor a right hander will have the ease of accessing the safety push button because it is located all the way up, quite far from the reach of any finger or thumb. Secondly, for me, the safety should have been Auto engage.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26921[/ATTACH] \n\n\n[B][U]Torch[/U][/B]\nAn amazing piece of accessory this little torch is. Yes, it is adjustable and the beam can be enlarged or diminished.\n[B]Hot: [/B]According to brother Jog3ee, it has a high beam up till 40 yards. Sufficient for me at least :).\n[B]Not: [/B]Once the torch is installed on the gun, the case won’t shut as the width of both the gun and the torch exceeds the available space in the case. Yes, another reason why I say that Hatsan could have done better with providing more space in the case.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26922[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26923[/ATTACH]\n \n[B][U]Concluding Thoughts & Opinions[/U][/B]\nI have read on several sites that the Hatsan BT65 Elite is a very powerful PCP and its power is overwhelming. Well, I will comment on that when I take it to the range so stay tuned till then. \nThe BT65 Elite is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a powerful, sturdy, ominous looking extremely accurate rifle (yet to test). In addition, with its Quattro 2 Stage trigger, it is a pleasure to shoot; not as smooth as the spring rifle champion, Airking but still it is very good. And given its power, which I have yet to measure with a chrony, this rifle is expected to be superb for hunting, with the .22 caliber version being the better choice for more serious air rifle hunters.\nFinally, even though some potential buyers who may be thinking that this gun is not that loud, Eeennnnn; reality check, it is significantly loud. There are no mentionable drawbacks with this rifle. Likewise, if this rifle’s extraordinary sights aren’t good enough for you, and you are not happy with the scope, swapping it out for the UTG 6-12x50 AO Mil-Dot Rifle Scope should make a world of difference.\n\nCheers', 1, 0, '182.181.182.165', 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

At 9.3 lbs and close to 10 lbs with the scope [B]this airgun is heavy[/B]. That said I felt that its weight is very nicely distributed and as soon as you shoulder the gun it balances off very well, not muzzle heavy or anything despite the fact I put an air stripper on it.

However, if the scope is mounted with the supplied rings, I believe one will manage to squeeze it in the box .\n\nThe supplied flashlight is surprisingly of good quality and its quite bright when I tested it out to 40 yards. The supplied scope is also much better built than I expected and has fairly clear optics. The best part was the reticle, its mil dot & a very fine reticle, unlike the reticles in Leapers or CP scope which are relatively thick. I''ll test the scope optice out to say 100 or so yards tomorrow but at 40-50 yards there was absolutely no complain on the optical quality.\n\n[B]Bipod is junk [/B]I don''t see a reason why Hatsan would even include it in the package. The sling will get the job done and has nothing in it to write home about.\n\n[B]Did I mention this thing is LOUD?[/B] Yes quite loud and it will definitely be needing a suppressor. The trigger is very nice I must say and it can further be adjusted for pull weight but I''ll play with that later when I have my filling system in place. [B]It does have a slight sideways play though which I did not expect.[/B] I''ll see if anything can be done about it.\n\nThe airgun comes with a manual safety switch and although it works and does its job effectively, they quality leaves something to be desired. Hatsan has used a very nice and sturdy brass switch for safety [B]but that confident "click" of the safety being engaged is lacking.[/B] A little quirk which I''m sure wont hamper the gun''s performance in any way but come on Hatsan !! you''ve done a great job here, why cut corners on these petty things?!\n\nI think I did mention this gun has an adjustable stock! But Hatsan has offered so much of it that it REALLY has become one of the defining features of this gun. After all the desired adjustments this gun fits the shooter like a glove! Hats off Hatsan.\n\nOverall, for the price of Rs 76,000/- I REALLY don''t think anything can match up with what Hatsan has managed to offer in this package. Hopefully this Sunday, this airgun will be put through its paces and that will be its REAL test as we''ll see how it performs in terms of; 1st and foremst Accuracy, Power, & Shots per fill.', 1, 0, '182.178.79.217', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Based on the company’s black Eagle LR, this light-rail-equipped sample arrived as a zombie-themed handgun wearing a green hydro-dipped illustration of the undead on its slide and a pair of Hogue green pearlized polymer custom grips\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecs and dimensions for this 1911 are the same as other current Iver Johnson five-inch-barreled Government models. This pistol comes with one eight-round magazine, a skeletonized hammer, as well as front and rear slide serrations. Magazines are made by ACT-MAG, and spares are available for $25 apiece. Keep in mind, we found that this pistol will feed from most aftermarket magazines.\r\n\r\nThe carbon-steel frame is cast, then CNC-machined, and carries a Picatinny rail that will accept anything from a pistol-mounted light to one of LaserLyte’s bayonets. It’s given a matte-black Cerakote finish designed to resist the corrosive effects of zombie blood and weather. Don’t get your hopes up that Iver Johnson will introduce this model with a stainless steel frame, as these pistols are built in the Philippines by Shooters Arms Manufacturing. Stainless is a difficult material to come by in that country, and attempting to procure enough of it would steeply affect the U.S. market price.\r\n\r\nIver Johnson currently has seven different 1911 models available, many sharing similar features. You can celebrate the fact that all are based on the Model 1911A1 with Series 70 safety system. The backstrap is complete with a flat, serrated steel mainspring housing and beavertail grip safety.\r\n\r\nControls are easy to reach with an extended slide stop and thumb safety. Combined with the beavertail grip safety and triggerguard relief cut, when you handle this pistol and throw your thumb up on the safety, its contours almost demand a high grip.\r\n\r\nAll models utilize metal-injection-molded (MIM) parts, and the slide and frame are hand-fitted for a smooth and tight fit. There’s no discernable wiggle with the slide-in battery, not in the slide rails or at the barrel bushing. This accounted for this pistol’s solid performance during our evaluation.\r\n\r\nThough the Eagle LR Zombie falls in the price point of the working class, it includes a lengthy list of features more common on custom guns: beveled mag well for those inevitable reloads, thin-cut angled serrations for positive slide manipulation, lowered and flared ejection port for spent brass to cleanly escape and a three-hole match trigger.\r\n\r\nver Johnson uses Millett’s white-outline, fully adjustable rear sight and dovetail front sight. This is a classic combination in the world of 1911s designed to extract the most accuracy from your go-to zombie pistol.\r\n\r\nWhat appears as a novelty to traditionalists is actually a great value and impressive performer at the range. Posting a variety of Darkotic splattering-zombie targets downrange at 25 yards, it was fairly easy to average two-inch groups from a bench. Our staff’s best five-shot group using 185-grain Hornady Z-MAX measured a write-home-to-mother 1.39 inches, and these fun targets made it worth posting them on the fridge.\r\n\r\nThe interesting finish on the slide doesn’t impede performance or handling, hasn’t worn as we thought it would have and, if anything, we’ve found the clearcoat actually aids in wiping powder residue from the muzzle after each range session.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion is simple: It’s the last sidearm you’ll ever need.\r\n\r\nFor a limited time, these zombie pistols are available through Zanders, Hicks Inc. and Big Rock Sports.\r\n\r\nOnly Available in American.', 1, 0, '182.189.75.64', 6, 1, 4, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Their dedication to blacksmithing stretched over centuries has polished their skills and their blacksmithing skills are amazing.they don&#8217;t use any of modern or electrical blacksmithing tools and rely on the primitive ones those have been used by their ancestors.  The work of some of their community members was seen by one industrialist of other province, as he halted by chance beside their camp. His business acumen felt the potential these poor nomads have and counseled with their elders to leave nomadic life and get settled and work for  his industrial estate in Wazirabad  Punjab.

Mostly the languages spoken in this region belong to &#8220;Indo-Arian Family&#8221;. The only language belonging to &#8220;Dravidian&#8221; family of this region is spoken by these nomadic blacksmiths and their fellow &#8220;Brahvi&#8221; tribe. Most of Brahvi Tribe now passes a settled life. It is said that Moen Jo Daro , (the centre of Indus Civilization, one of 4 cradles of human civilization, along with Mesopotamia, Egypt and Yang T&#8221;sekong  ,  a river  of China ) was built by the  people speaking language of Dravidian origin. The Arians attacked them; destroyed their capital Moen Jo daro and Dravidians were ousted from this region. While on the run , they totally abandoned this region and got settled in India, specially in Tamil Nado  and Sri Lanka. The Tamils in India and Sri Lanka are the descendents of those who once ruled the plains of Indus  Valley for more than a thousand years. On the other hand , victorious Arians established their own kingdoms and empires , gave birth to a new civilization and languages like Prakrat, Apbharnesh , Hindi, Persian and German. The historical proof German link with this region is the  Nazi sign of &#8220; Swastika&#8221; which is still in  an active use( in a mirror image, though) in Hindu religion as a very famous symbol of lord shiva&#8221;s worship and is visible on nearly every Hindu temple, specially on those who are related with lord shiva.

Any how I loaded both mags 16 each and fire at intervals of a few minutes i.e., the time it takes to load the mags\n\nI am new to pistol shooting as told earlier never fired a pistol an year ago and now when I asked Mr. Muslim Khan of LRC to place target at 50 meters for pistol shooting he could not believe me and thought I was insane as few people have attempted it at LRC with little success.\n\nBut at the end he and Mr. Younas admired it and they think I can do even better with more practice and time ( the thing which is very difficult to manage ) and must enter some competitive shooting ( Again requires a lot of time which I cannot afford )\n\nThis weekend I am going to do the same with some low end pistol like CF98 and see whether it is the gun or the man behind the gun that is important. Because I read in one of the article of Massad Ayoob that only some pisols have inherent accuracy of rifles and I firmly believe that CZ75B Stainless is one of them.\n\nAny tips to improve the accuracy are more than welcomed ?\n\nRegards', 1, 0, '182.189.39.199', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Any how I loaded both mags 16 each and fire at intervals of a few minutes i.e., the time it takes to load the mags\n\nI am new to pistol shooting as told earlier never fired a pistol an year ago and now when I asked Mr. Muslim Khan of LRC to place target at 50 meters for pistol shooting he could not believe me and thought I was insane as few people have attempted it at LRC with little success.\n\nBut at the end he and Mr. Younas admired it and they think I can do even better with more practice and time ( the thing which is very difficult to manage ) and must enter some competitive shooting ( Again requires a lot of time which I cannot afford )\n\nThis weekend I am going to do the same with some low end pistol like CF98 and see whether it is the gun or the man behind the gun that is important.

I wanted to confirm a few things from the gurus here:\n\nI met a couple of dealers in the past weeks and one of them told me regarding weapon licenses for Karachi. Firstly, right now licenses are being issued but only for Karachi East.... is there any validity in this? Im asking becuz all of them know my NIC is of Karachi East\n\nKhair. Secondly I have been told that even if you get a new license now I will have to get it computerized because they will be issued in manual form??? Really? then whats the purpose of doing this computerization procedure if they are going to release uncomputerised manual licenses again?!\n\nthirdly, the dealers advice not get any card licenses.... according to them ke "card license ka sochna bhi nahi"\n\nLastly, I asked ke after 31st Dec this year when I get a new license will it also be manual book form.. he said ke yes and u will have to get it computerised.. they say ke "tension nahi lo if they get all the licenses computerised till the end of 2014 wo bhi bari baat hai" but well these are the dealers opinions.\n\nSo guys pls comment on the above. if new licenses are being made... should we wait for 31st Dec or get them made? is there any authenticity in any of the above???\n\nthanks\n\nAH[/QUOTE]\n\nNew licenses are not being issued.

I lives in quetta and good quality rifles are hard to find and specially used ones. better to wait and buy a good one. [QUOTE=Deathrow;412443]Asalam Alaikum Supreme_Hunter, Welcome to the forum... bro the only option you do have is 0.22lr rifles and that too semi auto and not NIB... Which city you are in..? You should be able to find the Armscore ak47 clone in .22 second hand in that range but you can not fit a scope in that..400 meters is alot of distance... and if you wana shoot that far, you will have to spend alot of money...not to forget that to shoot that far you need to see that far aswell so a good scope is going to cost you a pretty handsome amount... Tell you what, in your budget you can get a very nice Airgun which should be good enough for small game... Consider it?The ammo is a 100 times cheaper, you are not going to need a license, no bangs, no issues with the LEAs, good enough for small game[/QUOTE]', 1, 0, '8.37.224.127', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Suspension gets the most hammering in every car so best to stick with OEM spec offset for any aftermarket wheels. Lots of chinese rims being sold in PK, and resellers are oblivious of Offset and majority buyers fall in the same bracket too - as long as wheels fit (i.e. PCD matches), the purchase is made. I''d recommend Forged Aluminium wheels as those would be lighter and stronger than stock wheels, a true upgrade.

(412890, 12478, 412884, 'jog3ee', 4022, '', 1386606939, 'Had a fun day yesterday with an Airgun guru at his farm, Major Ali. We went to test the BT65 and HW100 (belonging to Faraz Haider) . The setting was perfect as his farm allowed testing of the guns at up to 100+ yards. After a warm welcome and some initial gup shup we set out to test the guns and while at it, were served with simple yet very tasty partridges and teal :D it was steamed and cooked with nothing but salt. Awesome :D\n\nMost of the shooting was done at 47 yards and some groups were obtained at 30 yards. The HW 100 excelled at both the distances.\n\nThe HW100 is a gorgeous piece of equipment. I can easily say that its pictures simply do not do justice to it. At approx 27-28 fpe this gun is a pea shooter. Yes at up to 50 yards you can hit pea sized targets ALL DAY and it won''t miss a thing I can assure you that. It is one sweet shooter. Major sb was nothing but praises for the HW100 which truly lived up to its reputation. However at 62 and 78 yards the groups opened up significantly. We could not understand why but the only reason I can think of is that it was likely because of the scope mounted on that gun (Leapers 6-24x50) Any scope with finer reticle and this gun would produce tight groups even at that distance.\n\nWhen Major sb took his 1st shot through the chrony with the BT65, his 1st comment was, "Sir ap ka chrony kharab hai". The chrony read 1149 fps with Gamo promagnums. 5 shots with pro magnums were as follows:\n\n1149; 1150; 1159; 1158; 1152!! Average Energy 45.6 FPE.\n\nWe were all strongly convinced of this gun''s power, next target was to see what matters most! Accuracy. Oh the airgun is LOUDD!!! I don''t know how many times I''ve said that but as soon as I squeeze that trigger, the loud cracks leaves a grin on my face :D! Also the tested guns were literally out of the box as we hadn''t even cleaned the barrel. The gun wasn''t broken in and the barrel was obviously not seasoned.\n\nNext pellet was 21 grain barracuda but we stopped after taking 3 shots as it opened up the group considerably. at the end of this post I will mention all the shot strings that we chronied.\n\nNext up was the JSB 18 grain pellet which produced best results in this gun. The best group obtained by Major Ali at 47 yards was 1/2 inch; however the gun did not group consistently. It would open up the group when filled at 200 bar and as it hit the sweet spot of around 180 bar the groups would start to shrink considerably. The only reason I can think of this inconsistent performance is that the gun was new, not cleaned and not enough lead went through the barrel. Hopefully once 200-300 shots have been taken the gun should perform better.\n\nWe then tested JSB Exact monster pellets (25.4 grain) and although it shot at an average velocity of 933 fps the group I obtained at 47 yards was approx 1.25 inch (judging through the scope). Barracuda Match pellets were tested again and the result was not what we wanted, i.e. a 1 holer at 47 yards!! So yesterday, the best performing pellets remained JSB exact Jumbo for the Bt65.\n\nWe then zeroed the airguns and went for a quick hunt (came home with a decent bag of 13 birds approx 4 could not be retrieved). Most were shot through the HW100. Major Ali also showed us his BSA s10 whic was tuned at approx 32-33 FPE and was amazingly silent, also very consistent and accurate.\n\nOverall, where the power and the loud bark of BT65 thrilled us, the resulting accuracy left something to be desired. It did produce 1/2 inch groups but the consistency was lacking. As stated above it could be due to several factors. However, this is just the beginning and i''m sure for us, there''s a lot to be learnt about how a PCP behaves.', 1, 0, '209.107.208.186', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

So they may slightly over pressure after driving as I described in my previous post!\nRegards[/QUOTE]\n\nIn my limited understanding, tires do not expire in 3 years if stored and used properly (But how do you ensure anything like that in Pakistan when there are tires with fake stamps etc). 5-6 years old is not a good idea, even if brand new. I am a Michelin guy and live in very harsh weather conditions, including lesser than -40 Celcius temperatures (yes, I ask that question everyday, why?) and lots of off roading (gravel roads, bajree, kuchi sarak), usually we have to keep 2 sets, one for the winter and one for the spring, summer and fall. Two more reasons I can think of since it seems the sidewall blew out, there was either a breakage in the steel belts and a bubble had formed and went unobserved, which can pop without notice or the tire had a repaired sidewall, which is not a good idea to start with.\n\nRegarding Dr. Gilani''s comment, you are right and so is Aquarius, it is still called a cold check if one drives less than 2 kms. The tires do not warm up that quick unless a teenager is driving (Ah! Those fun days when I wrecked it and dad paid to get it fixed, so I could wreck it again, and he never understood why our tires wore out every 2-3 months).\n\nA regular check up by a competent mechanic is very important, specially if you cannot identify symptoms.\n\nDr. Gilani I have forgotten the Pakistani driving conditions safety rules, which of course make sense to change tires so frequently, our all season tires (read 3 season, I have those on my Honda CR-V and was stuck in snow in my own driveway this morning and it is a 4X4, hang on, hang on, I did manage to get out by myself, I know a few tricks, but the point is the winter here demands Michelin X-Ice XI3 tires) usually are rated for 80,000 km and above and we use them that much too.

I am a Michelin guy and live in very harsh weather conditions, including lesser than -40 Celcius temperatures (yes, I ask that question everyday, why?) and lots of off roading (gravel roads, bajree, kuchi sarak), usually we have to keep 2 sets, one for the winter and one for the spring, summer and fall. Two more reasons I can think of since it seems the sidewall blew out, there was either a breakage in the steel belts and a bubble had formed and went unobserved, which can pop without notice or the tire had a repaired sidewall, which is not a good idea to start with.\n\nRegarding Dr. Gilani''s comment, you are right and so is Aquarius, it is still called a cold check if one drives less than 2 kms. The tires do not warm up that quick unless a teenager is driving (Ah!

I posted this post just to let every body knows that the clones looks more original then originals, so be very careful while purchasing a Mak.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nAquarius brother if by chance you feel your chormed MAK is a clone and you want to sale it then only give me a CALL...........\n:bounce:', 1, 0, '182.185.65.72', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Who''d want that old, clunky thing when he could buy a modern gun?  Nobody cared about the 1911, and there were no aftermarket parts or clone guns until the "service pistol" shooting matches suddenly became popular.  Suddenly there was a big market to the shooters, and then it took off.  Right now we''re seeing the same sort of thing with the "cowboy action shooter" people, who are now a large enough market that Italian, Brazilian, and Chinese companies are importing replicas of the antique firearms used in that type of competition.  \n\n Now 1911s are considered "high end" guns, but it wasn''t that long ago that people would look at you funny and ask, "What are you dragging *that* around for?"\n\n\n The .30-bore''s only real problem is the old-style round nose full metal jacket bullet.  That''s standard military stuff.  No, performance isn''t that great compared to modern ammunition... but old-school "ball" 9mm and .45 don''t do all that good either.

We cannot get beyond this fact, I think. [IMG]http://www.thegunforum.net/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif[/IMG] \n\nAny other brand handgun, be it a budget one or an HK, will suffer badly at the hands of dealers at time of reselling. Our forums have been a great help for our enthusiasts with this respect, but there''s still a larger fraction of gun owners out there who still are subject to the sharpness of greedy dealer''s cut- throat swords and mercy at resale time. \n\nA Glock purchased at any price whatsoever in the range of 200-280K''s is an investment. It can gain in prices again and even a used one will cause no or insignificant loss at selling time. Those seeking the better benefit can purchase now at lower prices and watch it gain later. Those having it already and who purchased at higher prices are still not in any kind of loss, since it will stabilize sooner or later. It''s an automatic and undeniable market mechanism of demand/supply.\n\nThere''s no doubt that it ideally should be a 60-80K handgun, like any Brazil/Turkey handgun, yet this would sadly not be possible as long as the freighting origin remains USA or Vienna, or as longer as this stupid ban is in order.\n\nI hope I could get a Gen4 G-26 or a G-30 at 200K''s soon, preferably lower.

Its a German manufactured Sig and therefore not listed on any USA site; matter of fact it took me a while to dig it up on the internet as everytime I typed P226S all that kept popping up was X series pistols. \n\nThis gun is chambered for 9mm and retails for 1000Euros. The 3 dot sights are adjustable and are quite nicely tucked in the slide. The frame seems to be aluminum, has no rails and the slide has been milled lightened from the inside with the exterior containing front cocking serrations and the markings containing the S. The barrel is thicker than that found on regular P226 and is of P226 standard length. The grips are soft rubber with good traction and the magazines also have a rubber bottom plate. The thumb controls are only on the left side of the gun making it a right hand shooter friendly gun. \n\nNow we get to the real thing... Trigger. Sigs have lately come out with an SRT trigger which is good but nothing compares to the trigger breaks of the X6 or X5 series; it seems that the trigger system on this gun is from the X Series Mastershop pistols like the X5 All Rounder. \n\nMe and Rotorcraft compared it with my X5 Tactical and the X5 Black and White. It matched the X5 Tactical break but the X5 Black & White seemed lighter. I love the feel of this gun.\n\nAfter doing the usual playing with the gun in front of the TV today I took it out to the range. The results could have been better but I was tired - I had just finished shooting (practicing Air Pistol) for an hour and a half and my arm had literally just given up on me. Still this gun was a joy to shoot, the recoil seemed very tamed due to the thick rubber grips. The sight aperature was very nice and clear. \n\nAnd again the trigger... wow!\n\nHere is the result - firing 25 meters (27 yards) - single handed.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/222.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '115.186.153.79', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Their PEW factory is very large (on scale of PEW).\n2. They have lot of Technicians.\n3. The Techs can fully understand engineering drawings.\n4. Their precision is wonderful and they can fully follow engineering tolerances.\n5. They were able to provide me the ASTM (a standard) specification metallurgical steel.\n6. They were expensive in comparison to other shops BUT it is understandable.\n7. I think they have CNC machines - I will check with my technician and inform/post about this.\n8.

The adapters are short and long reach and with threads to be attached instead of your car''s spark plugs.  When you crank engine for few seconds (with electric wire connection disconnected) will register the pressure developed. If issue with rings worn out or valves issue - it will be diagnosed.  Wet test is to check if valve issue and dry test to check of rings bad! Every engine has its pressure that is specified by car manufacturer. E.G corolla 1996 has 145 psi pressure as correct design pressure.

Just get yourself some Flitz (or any other metal polish available in your market) and start scrubbing! A Dremel tool would be ideal, but a whole lot of elbow grease and patience could yield the same results. That would remove the original black, along with the rust, and leave you with a shiny finish bare metal finish. You could leave it at that if you like the look. The bare metal would be prone to rust, but regular cleaning and a thin layer of oil, or the application of a clear coat, would solve that issue. For a shiny black finish, you would still polish the gun down to bare metal, followed by bluing. Bluing is a process of oxidizing the metal''s surface with chemicals, it is what you see on new guns that are shiny and black. Factories employ what is known as a hot bluing process, some quality gunsmiths also offer the service.

Home department computerised ones\n \n 3). Home department back dated manual ones\n \n 4). DC ones\n \n 5). Baluchistan/KPK \n \n The all Pak ministry of interior books used to be the best bet all  around. I myself had one. but unfortunately after the whole book to card  fiasco ended up cancelling mine. (I have subsequently reacquired it)  The current card ministry of interiors are totally unrecommended IMHO.  One cannot change the weapon on them and the sindh high court has issued  a judgement against them. More ever there is no set procedure for  renewing them.\n \n They might be re-converted to the books from  which they were forcibly converted to cards. However if that''s what you  want then the current rate is 27000 and a wait of 4-6 weeks for the  demand note. Once you get the demand note u purchase the weapon and get  it entered at the DC office. After which it will be taken to NADRA where  they will verify it and issue u a card within 30-90 days. \n \n Status: Open\n \n Dealers making em: Saddar Armoury (Lucky Star) and Guns and Ammo (Zamzama)\n \n HD computerised ones:\n \n They are issued by the Home department and the applicant has to  personally visit the department where they take pictures and thumb scans  and make a license exactly like the passport. (in fact a fellow member  has passed off his passport as a license to the cops)\n \n The  documentary requirements include NTN number, house utility bills if  house is owned by the applicant (or the CNIC of the person whose house u  are living in as well as the utility bills Specifically gas and  electricity)\n \n No chance of any illegality or hanky panky  whatsoever since all the data is actually submitted by the applicant  himself just like NADRA CNIC.\n \n Minimum age requirements: 25 years\n \n Rate 18000 or so.\n \n Status: Virtualy closed. These licenses require the signature of the Home minister and Home sec. \n \n Source: The incharge of the computerised arms license department at the Home dep.\n \n However as of now Mr. imran here has just informed the forum that he  has made one recently. I will try and arrange another meeting with the  in charge of the Computerized arms license cell to get a clear picture  and inform accordingly. \n \n Home department Back dated manual licenses:\n \n Around 20000 or so and a highly illigal under-the-table-practice that can get the prospective licensee in trouble \n \n Deputy Commisioner''s License\n \n These are being issued by the deputy commissioners of the province. All  weapons purchased on them are endorsed at the DC office.\n \n The  minimum age requirements are 18 years. However they prefer to issue em  to people at least 21 years old.

Home department computerised ones\n \n 3). Home department back dated manual ones\n \n 4). DC ones\n \n 5). Baluchistan/KPK \n \n The all Pak ministry of interior books used to be the best bet all  around. I myself had one. but unfortunately after the whole book to card  fiasco ended up cancelling mine. (I have subsequently reacquired it)  The current card ministry of interiors are totally unrecommended IMHO.  One cannot change the weapon on them and the sindh high court has issued  a judgement against them. More ever there is no set procedure for  renewing them.\n \n They might be re-converted to the books from  which they were forcibly converted to cards. However if that''s what you  want then the current rate is 27000 and a wait of 4-6 weeks for the  demand note. Once you get the demand note u purchase the weapon and get  it entered at the DC office. After which it will be taken to NADRA where  they will verify it and issue u a card within 30-90 days. \n \n Status: Open\n \n Dealers making em: Saddar Armoury (Lucky Star) and Guns and Ammo (Zamzama)\n \n HD computerised ones:\n \n They are issued by the Home department and the applicant has to  personally visit the department where they take pictures and thumb scans  and make a license exactly like the passport. (in fact a fellow member  has passed off his passport as a license to the cops)\n \n The  documentary requirements include NTN number, house utility bills if  house is owned by the applicant (or the CNIC of the person whose house u  are living in as well as the utility bills Specifically gas and  electricity)\n \n No chance of any illegality or hanky panky  whatsoever since all the data is actually submitted by the applicant  himself just like NADRA CNIC.\n \n Minimum age requirements: 25 years\n \n Rate 18000 or so.\n \n Status: Virtualy closed. These licenses require the signature of the Home minister and Home sec. \n \n Source: The incharge of the computerised arms license department at the Home dep.\n \n However as of now Mr. imran here has just informed the forum that he  has made one recently. I will try and arrange another meeting with the  in charge of the Computerized arms license cell to get a clear picture  and inform accordingly. \n \n Home department Back dated manual licenses:\n \n Around 20000 or so and a highly illigal under-the-table-practice that can get the prospective licensee in trouble \n \n Deputy Commisioner''s License\n \n These are being issued by the deputy commissioners of the province. All  weapons purchased on them are endorsed at the DC office.\n \n The  minimum age requirements are 18 years. However they prefer to issue em  to people at least 21 years old. These do not require the person to go  anywhere or submit anything beyond his CNIC copy and a couple of  passport sized pics. The dealers do the rest.\n \n Current rate is 14-18000 depending on dealer to dealer.\n \n turn around time is around 4 to 8 weeks (Approx.)\n \n dealer Ali Muhammad and sons 15-16000 Adnan) (Used to be 15000 till last week)& Hm Traders (Abbas 14000). \n \n Guns and Ammo 18000 Daad 18000, Mega armoury 17000,(Danish.

As far as accuracy is concerned, the gun is still in its break-in period so cant say much at the moment. Secondly the reduced weight has significantly contributed to the ease of shoulder firing capabilities of the rifle and a bench is not required anymore for target shooting at even 35 odd yards. \n\n\nCheers buddy. Unlike my previous idea of making a Silencer, I tried on this readily available one. The threads on the silencer''s coupling were not compatible with the ones on the rifle''s barrel and I had to make another one for it. Long Live the Lathe Machine :D. Now I need to find some decibel measurement device and it will give us an exact idea of how beneficial this Silencer has been.

Its a smooth sail all together. lol\n\nComing to your questions:\n[U]Balance:[/U]\nNo doubt, the rifle is now comparatively front heavy, but overall the weight is so much lesser that its frontal weight doesn''t feel awkward. The shouldering is not as it used to be (the old stock being fully adjustable), however I didnt feel disconnected when I tried it for the first time. With the old stock I ranked it at 8.5/10 and now it is somewhere 7/10.\n[U]\nComfortable to hold & Shoot: \n[/U]Yes it is comfortable but I guess if I install a rail under the cylinder, it will make it more tactical, aesthetically and will also give the shooter the option of using front grips so there will be a practical use as well. The rear pistol grip is a delight :). \n\n[U]Cocking:\n[/U]As easy as it was with the original stock. The newly installed tactical stock (which is of M16) is a solid fit and doesn''t budge at all. \n\n[U]Further Modifications:\n[/U]You know me buddy :D. I am never content with how a rifle should look and may soon take on another endeavor of a similar sort ;). By the way, the trigger guard, polishing/finishing of the modified receiver and installation of the front grip through a picatinny rail are in pipeline, InshAllah.  \n\n[U]Receiver:\n[/U]Yes the receiver is aluminium :).

Home department computerised ones\n \n 3). Home department back dated manual ones\n \n 4). DC ones\n \n 5). Baluchistan/KPK \n \n The all Pak ministry of interior books used to be the best bet all  around. I myself had one. but unfortunately after the whole book to card  fiasco ended up cancelling mine. (I have subsequently reacquired it)  The current card ministry of interiors are totally unrecommended IMHO.  One cannot change the weapon on them and the sindh high court has issued  a judgement against them. More ever there is no set procedure for  renewing them.\n \n They might be re-converted to the books from  which they were forcibly converted to cards. However if that''s what you  want then the current rate is 27000 and a wait of 4-6 weeks for the  demand note. Once you get the demand note u purchase the weapon and get  it entered at the DC office. After which it will be taken to NADRA where  they will verify it and issue u a card within 30-90 days. \n \n Status: Open\n \n Dealers making em: Saddar Armoury (Lucky Star) and Guns and Ammo (Zamzama)\n \n HD computerised ones:\n \n They are issued by the Home department and the applicant has to  personally visit the department where they take pictures and thumb scans  and make a license exactly like the passport. (in fact a fellow member  has passed off his passport as a license to the cops)\n \n The  documentary requirements include NTN number, house utility bills if  house is owned by the applicant (or the CNIC of the person whose house u  are living in as well as the utility bills Specifically gas and  electricity)\n \n No chance of any illegality or hanky panky  whatsoever since all the data is actually submitted by the applicant  himself just like NADRA CNIC.\n \n Minimum age requirements: 25 years\n \n Rate 18000 or so.\n \n Status: Virtualy closed. These licenses require the signature of the Home minister and Home sec. \n \n Source: The incharge of the computerised arms license department at the Home dep.\n \n However as of now Mr. imran here has just informed the forum that he  has made one recently. I will try and arrange another meeting with the  in charge of the Computerized arms license cell to get a clear picture  and inform accordingly. \n \n Home department Back dated manual licenses:\n \n Around 20000 or so and a highly illigal under-the-table-practice that can get the prospective licensee in trouble \n \n Deputy Commisioner''s License\n \n These are being issued by the deputy commissioners of the province. All  weapons purchased on them are endorsed at the DC office.\n \n The  minimum age requirements are 18 years. However they prefer to issue em  to people at least 21 years old. These do not require the person to go  anywhere or submit anything beyond his CNIC copy and a couple of  passport sized pics. The dealers do the rest.\n \n Current rate is 14-18000 depending on dealer to dealer.\n \n turn around time is around 4 to 8 weeks (Approx.)\n \n dealer Ali Muhammad and sons 15-16000 Adnan) (Used to be 15000 till last week)& Hm Traders (Abbas 14000). \n \n Guns and Ammo 18000 Daad 18000, Mega armoury 17000,(Danish. I have made  a couple of HD computerised ones through him) Huffaz Corp.18000 However  I have not worked with any of them other then mega so cant say anything  about their performance.\n \n In this case u just hand over your  CNIC copy as well as pass port sized pics. A few thousand bucks as  advance and wait for em to call. They usually promise 3 to 4 weeks and  the average time is 6 weeks or so. \n \n Balauchistan KPK licenses\n \n (Somebody correct me if I am wrong but a all Pak lic is for Pakistanis  only. While the provincial licenses are for also for their respective  provinces. If u are a sindh resident or have a sindh domicile then u are  eligible for a Sindh lic. But if you don''t have a Baluchistan domicile  or residency or even a birth certificate then what legal authority does  the DC have in issuing that lic?\n \n After all u are completely outside his jurisdiction)\n \n For provincial license there must be some kind of relation to the  district from which the lic is issued to qualify to get an arms licence  from that province\n \n Permanent or Temperory address on the CNIC\n Birth certificate from concern province\n Property ownership (In that province)\n Name in voter list\n \n If none of them are there. Then I see NO reason what soever that the DC  will issue such a lic. More ever 144 carry permits are not issued to  such licenses (usually) since their antecedents are dubious at best.\n \n Unscrupulous dealers do make such lics though. Turn around time. A fortnight or so.\n \n ALL lics (barring the ministry of interior cards) need to be registered at the local P.S and stamped by the Muharrir[/quote]', 1, 0, '117.20.16.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is just wastage of money. e.g., on one weekend I went through several rounds of different calibers & when I came home I estimated that I have lost a good 8 - 10 K Rs ammo, not to learn anything extra but just for the sake of membership\n\nLRC do not allow shotguns which in my opinion is the most versatile weapon without changing the caliber. It would be fun to shoot and see pattern spread of different brands and different types of ammo, their penetration and slugs etc. But [B]"SHOTGUNS ARE NOT ALLOWED AT LRC FOR AN ORDINARY PERSON LIKE ME"[/B]. There is very visible discrimination of LRC management from member to member. Some are testing their shotguns or even automatic rifles in semiauto mode with a caliber more than .22 LR\n\nThey did a great FAVOR for me, i.e., letting me get my wifes membership fees for free by making a supplementary card but she rarely visits LRC so they are wisely collecting 12K a year but showing they are doing a great favor when it is NOT a favor but a move to collect more money.\n\nIn short there is no attraction left for me at LRC, I am done with it. I have learnt how to shoot a handgun and I am quiet good at it. Rifles & Shotguns are not allowed and I cannot use them properly, have to go to some friends place usually outside the Lahore to fire Long guns. So, what is the fun of taking your weapons through several checkposts outside the city when you are a member of so called LAHORE RIFLE CLUB.\n\nIt should be named LAHORE PISTOL / HANDGUN CLUB as no real rifles are allowed\n\nAnyhow whatever I said is my own personal opinion based on facts and it is not necessary that everyone should agree with it but plz feel free to post your comments and thoughts regarding the current merits and demerits of LRC.

I was planning to put a metal block under the receiver but then the suggestion came  from Faheem, the Lathe machine expert and a very talented young chap that we should use an aluminium rail (The shopkeeper called this design [I]M36 Wood[/I]) as it will be lighter and its purpose is only to cover the trigger mechanism.

The original idea came about ten years back to Swiss armourer Vivian Mueller, who at the time experienced cutting and welding together multiple parts of the famous Sig P210: the result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well. Our idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining. The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.', 1, 0, '173.209.122.102', 0, 1, 10, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is based on the "1 degree of liberty mechanical law" of the main components (Barrel, Locking Block and Bolt-slide). The major benefits of the invention are:\n[LIST]\n[*]In line barrel operation with very tight tolerances with the slide \n[*]Lowest barrel center line over hand grip in history (12 mm) \n[*]Lowest vertical mass movement on operating pin (locking block only and not the whole barrel) \n[*]Fastest locking-unlocking time \n[*]Fully rail-guided barrel inside the slide, for tremendous accuracy coupling with the aiming devices \n[*]Highest ammunition feed level into the barrel, for trouble-free use of any type of bullet, with no deformation upon chambering \n[*]Shortest unlocking-locking action travel (4mm diameter operating pin) \n[*]Totally sealed barrel-to-slide ejection port area, for safest operations of the gun in mud, dirt, dust \n[*]Strongest slide at ejection port area, due to minimal open profile of the same \n[/LIST]\n[B]THE AMBIDEXTROUS MAGAZINE RELEASE[/B]\n\nFor the first time a traditional two-sided female notch magazine can be used with a totally ambidextrous, lateral operation (conventional push button) latch. This has been possible thanks to the Arsenal Firearms new patented design, made of only 2 parts: latch and spring-stop. The system is entirely taken down by hand with no tools and features also the engagement of both magazine notches contemporarily for maximum safety of retention during extreme use of the pistol and will prevent accidental magazine loss as the gun drops on a hard surface. \n\n\n[B]THE TRIGGER SAFETY[/B]\n\nUnlike other competitor&#8217;s trigger safety systems, where the trigger is split into 2 parts making the shooter often uncomfortable with trigger feel and release predictability, the Arsenal Firearms single trigger safety system comes as another true patented innovation: the trigger in fact cannot be accidentally pulled for the top portion of the arch (i.e. by a foreign object) as the special shoulder and rotation-travel of the trigger body will prevent it. The result is a safety trigger, with single arch and a competition pistol feel and performance, for maximum first-shot trustable placement.', 1, 0, '173.209.122.102', 0, 1, 10, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Saw the videos in which the gun was thrown into mud, water etc. etc. and test fired. Nice job. However, more tests would be needed. DSA agrees to undergo numerous test in coming times IA.\n\n3. The Gun will be launched in next month - in process of launching.\n\n4. IDPA by end of this month, will showcase and demonstrate its use.\n\n5. DSA is committed to continuous improvement.\n\n[U][B]My suggestions to DSA were:[/B][/U]\n1. I briefed DSA about various tests done on Intl level on guns including my favorite CZ 75 P01.  DSA know many and would love to do others in coming times.\n\n2. Drop test (many times) - on loaded, cocked gun with blank round - DSA did such test on their shotguns and they will ensure that are done on TRUSTSHOOT.\n\n3. Mixing of parts of various aged guns and re-assembling and being able to fire without any issue - they will ensure that.\n\n4. Mean Round Between Failures (MRBF) - a US standard is about 500, CZ is +2100. I asked DSA to come up with their such QUANTIFIABLE values - they very kindly agreed and will be done in future.\n\n5. Safety against accidental firing i.e. safety on pin and safety on hammer. They will do this :) in coming times! They already discussed this in their internal meetings!\n\n6. For FATIGUE LIFE i.e. 5000 rounds life is theoretical SAFE figure - DSA thinks it can be and will be more but they want to keep this posted to be lower till the test of time proves it otherwise! This their way not to over-claim just to sell. They want to be loyal to customer and with time they will increase this number when [I][U]verified[/U][/I].\n\n7. I also suggested doing +P or ++P (whatever suitable) to have few rounds fired of those to ensure safety on over-pressure design! DSA agrees to firm up on this strategy. \n\n[U][B]DSA Conclusion:[/B][/U]\nA. They are working in PAK for so many decades. They have very good shotguns and they will surely do their best in engineering the 9mm pistol.\n\nB. They request us to bare with DSA, support DSA and DSA is determined not to disappoint customers.\n\nC. DSA very humbly requests that DO NOT OVER demand right away and start comparing their 9mm with BEST TOP liner guns of the world. Give them some room and they will surely compete with them. They claim and challenge that within the price tag of Rs.30k or less; can anyone bring a gun which meets or exceeds performance of their gun? [U]I agree they are right![/U]\n\n[U][B]My Conclusion:[/B][/U]\nI. I am to support a pure PAK product. This is how products have grown and succeeded in other countries.\n\nII. If I can buy CZ P01, VEPR-12 etc. etc. with price tag of around ++several hundred thousand ks - I will surely buy this gun, even if it is not good - and I am sure now it is not bad at all. If I can fire S&B of several thousands what is the harm to support a few thousand Rs PAK made GUN?\n\nIII.  DSA want to have tested their products in my facility - how? I have yet to figure a full scientific way! I promised that I will go through literature and come up with some ways to do this.\n\nIV.

Here is what I think I understand about it.\n1. It has a longer barrel in a small package and can fire 9mm +P ammo.\n2. It is a neat design and a semi custom gun.\n3. It has more parts, so chances of something going wrong are higher.\n4. Since the claw picks up the next round from the mag, the slide does not lock back after firing the last round, also will have problems with cheaper ammo, which is improperly crimped.\n5.

Report is as under:\n\n1. Saw the gun, looks reasonable to me to own one! May be Not as beautiful to some - but made in Pak is something important for me!\n\n2. Saw the videos in which the gun was thrown into mud, water etc. etc. and test fired. Nice job. However, more tests would be needed. DSA agrees to undergo numerous test in coming times IA.\n\n3. The Gun will be launched in next month - in process of launching.\n\n4. IDPA by end of this month, will showcase and demonstrate its use.\n\n5. DSA is committed to continuous improvement.\n\n[U][B]My suggestions to DSA were:[/B][/U]\n1. I briefed DSA about various tests done on Intl level on guns including my favorite CZ 75 P01. DSA know many and would love to do others in coming times.\n\n2. Drop test (many times) - on loaded, cocked gun with blank round - DSA did such test on their shotguns and they will ensure that are done on TRUSTSHOOT.\n\n3. Mixing of parts of various aged guns and re-assembling and being able to fire without any issue - they will ensure that.\n\n4. Mean Round Between Failures (MRBF) - a US standard is about 500, CZ is +2100. I asked DSA to come up with their such QUANTIFIABLE values - they very kindly agreed and will be done in future.\n\n5. Safety against accidental firing i.e. safety on pin and safety on hammer. They will do this :) in coming times! They already discussed this in their internal meetings!\n\n6. For FATIGUE LIFE i.e. 5000 rounds life is theoretical SAFE figure - DSA thinks it can be and will be more but they want to keep this posted to be lower till the test of time proves it otherwise! This their way not to over-claim just to sell. They want to be loyal to customer and with time they will increase this number when [I][U]verified[/U][/I].\n\n7. I also suggested doing +P or ++P (whatever suitable) to have few rounds fired of those to ensure safety on over-pressure design! DSA agrees to firm up on this strategy. \n\n[U][B]DSA Conclusion:[/B][/U]\nA. They are working in PAK for so many decades. They have very good shotguns and they will surely do their best in engineering the 9mm pistol.\nB. They request us to bare with DSA, support DSA and DSA is determined not to disappoint customers.\nC. DSA very humbly requests that DO NOT OVER demand right away and start comparing their 9mm with BEST TOP liner guns of the world. Give them some room and they will surely compete with them. They claim and challenge that within the price tag of Rs.30k or less; can anyone bring a gun which meets or exceeds performance of their gun? [U]I agree they are right![/U]\n\n[U][B]My Conclusion:[/B][/U]\nI. I am to support a pure PAK product. This is how products have grown and succeeded in other counties.\n\nII. If I can buy CZ P01, VEPR-12 etc. etc. with price tag of around ++several hundred thousand ks - I will surely buy this gun, even if it is not good - and I am sure now it is not bad at all. If I can fire S&B of several thousands what is the harm to support a few thousand Rs PAK made GUN?\n\nIII. DSA want to have tested their products in my facility - how? I have yet to figure a full scientific way! I promised that I will go through literature and come up with some ways to do this.\n\nIV. DSA is working and supporting PAK in many ways of making some wonderful product that I cannot share here :) as it is not the right place :)\n\nGreat Job DSA we are proud of you and will surely support!\nRegards\n\nPS: Errors and omissions and/or misinterpretation of any kind on my part is accepted and forgiveness sought. The above is no way a statement of DSA, therefore forgiveness is requested from all. An attempt to meet DSA and get their point of view and encourage/hail them in personal capacity for PAK product AND enlighten myself, is the only reason to post this text above.[/QUOTE]\n\nDr_Gilani Brother realy a great job we all are with DSA as this is our own country product and inshallah we will proudly support them.\nREGARDS', 1, 0, '182.181.221.144', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

They are being marketed as STI GP6 in USA, and are popular in production class competitions in Europe. They only use parts made out of bar stock but the Grand Power guns are all CNC machined or wired EDM''d. There are no cast or MIM parts used. They are hand fitted, so we can call them semi custom. They K100 9mm retails for about $540.00 and X-TRIM for $640.00 here. I got my X-TRIM on a Christmas special with 3 magazines (it comes with 2 in the box, they are $45 each) and a set of different grips for $634 taxes included shipped to my house. Magazine capacity here would be limited to 10 as per law. Here you see the MK7 model, MK12 is out now, which has a Glock-like system for dis-assembly.\n[B]\nK100 X-TRIM[/B]\n\nCaliber: 9mm Luger \nTrigger mechanism: SA / DA\nTrigger pull weight: 20-25N / 35-40N\nOverall length: 202.5mm\nHeight without magazine: 133.5mm\nWidth: 36mm\nBarrel length: 108mm\nWeight w/o magazine: 680g\nWeight w empty magazine: 790g\nStandard magazine capacity: 15\n\n\nK100 X-TRIM. The new shape of the slide resulted in weight reduction; the gun appears light and predaceous. The revealed barrel together with an emphasized castellation of the slide offers an attractive design putting the shooting experience on the first place. The sights consists of a side-adjustable steel Dynamic rear sight  and fibre optic front sight.\n\n\n\n[B]K100[/B]\n\nCaliber: 9mm Luger \nTrigger mechanism: SA / DA\nTrigger pull weight: 20-25N / 35-40N\nOverall length: 202.5mm\nHeight without magazine: 133.5mm\nWidth: 36mm\nBarrel length: 108mm\nWeight w/o magazine: 740g\nWeight w empty magazine: 820g\nStandard magazine capacity: 15\n\n\nThe K100 with an SA/DA trigger mechanism is a result of incorporating the most strict requirements imposed on universal guns with its ergonomics suitable for shooters of practical disciplines as well as for special units of military forces. The front part of the frame is fitted with universal tactical Picatinny rail MIL STD 1913. The K100 Mk12 is the upgrade of the well-known Mk6 and Mk7 models; it comes with 4 removable hand-grips. Easy-to-remove hand-grips make the gun an ideal choice for multi-user shooting practice. The enhanced ergonomic design increases hand-grip while shooting, keeping both the hand and the mind of the shooter focused firmly on their target.\n\n\n[video=vimeo;82240390]https://vimeo.com/82240390[/video]\n\n[URL]https://vimeo.com/82241768[/URL], if this link does not work just search Vimeo for Grand Power K100 or channel gunguys\n\nA thread at Canadian Gun Nutz with a brief about company with pictures.\n[URL]http://www.canadiangunnutz.com/forum/showthread.php/997065-What-is-Grand-Power?highlight=shot[/URL]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27411[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27412[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27413[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27415[/ATTACH]\nWajoode zun say hay qainaat may rung!\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27414[/ATTACH]', 1, 0, '173.209.122.102', 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Or you may find them on the net. And always carry out dry test first. No more than a table spoon oil on the piston for wet test. Crank no more than 5 times per piston, no point cranking it more as that would just drain the battery and not make a difference as tester guage needle will stay on maximum psi. 1 cylinder test at a time (dry first, then wet, fit and tighten spark plug, test second cylinder and so forth) and leave the plugs fitted in other 3 pistons (assuming 4 cylinders car) because you want to test with compression (& resistance) in all cylinders to mimic actual engine running condition.\r\n\r\nMy preferred approach is to dry test all cylinders first and then wet test after. Reason is to avoid any oil getting in the guage to avoid compromising dry test results.\r\n\r\nAnd test in a ventilated area because once you start the car, there will be blue smoke (burnt engine oil from wet test).

It all started almost 6 months back when I started looking for a PCP and after a lot of tamaktoyan, I decided upon Hatsan BT65 Elite (I am only kidding myself, the list is long, but all in good time, InshAllah. ). Now the challenge was, where to get one from?? Hmm a million dollar question. Well believe me, no stones were left unturned and almost all of relatives living abroad; every friend either coming to Pakistan or leaving; about half a dozen Customs officials; a sibling in Dubai; a PIA steward; several dealers of fire and not-so-fire arms; in short, for me it was like requesting a hefty portion of our country’s populace to help me out in this regard but all in vain. In between all this time there was one door which still needed knocking and that was Hira Arms Lahore, an importer of Hatsan in Pakistan. \n\nMr Nafees Malik, the owner was contacted and he informed me that his consignment will be reaching in two weeks’ time. Frankly speaking, after that for another 6 months those “Two weeks” never came. But at the same time, I have to acknowledge the fact that the stated [I]wait-period [/I]decreased from weeks to days and then simply to hours. lol. To some of my partners in crime (identity will be disclosed later), I used to refer to Mr. Malik as [I]Mr. Dou-haftoon-main-a-jay-gi [/I]and a few more hyphenated names (nothing inappropriate :) ). Malik sb has a certain way of keeping his clients hooked, which from business POV may be a good idea but at the same time the strategy may backfire while dealing with hotheads like myself. Hahah. (I had to keep my cool as an Elite was at stake ;) ). So as it is said, “all is well that ends well” and yes, AT LAST in a state of WELL the whole waiting episode ended. The Elite reached Hira Arms and I heard the sweet symphony of Aap-ki-call-ka-intizar-tha. :D\n\nAt the moment, the gun is still in Lahore and is expected to reach me by the mid of the coming week so a pictorial review is in place, inshAllah. The identity of my partners in crime will be disclosed along with the detailed review, with their permission. The details about price etc will also be shared accordingly. \n\nThe rifle’s package includes the following items;\n·         3 Mags\n·         255cc cylinder (removable) with pressure gauge\n·         Mounted sling swivels\n·         An excuse for a Bipod. (Hatsan can do better than that, I am sure).\n·         A hard case. Its quality I am presuming to be very low. (Waiting till I see it in person).\n·         A sling\n·         A torch which can be installed on the picatinny rail. (Hatsan BT65 has three rails in its synthetic stock). Did I mention that I got the Synthetic stock with Thumbhole? No? Really? I guess that info fell through the cracks :).\n·         Optima 3-12x44 AO scope along with two piece mount.  (I may or may not change this scope but only after the Optima has been put to test).\n\nI also got myself a Hill Pump. The pump for the Hatsan will be reaching Hira Arms in the mid of the current month and I am sure it must be of good quality but I wanted to buy a reliable pump which can be used with any and almost all (with some alteration) the PCPs which are yet to land in my collection, InshAllah. So stay tuned and the range review will be posted very soon. For the time being please be content with the low resolution cellphone pics of the beast. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26795[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26796[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26797[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]26798[/ATTACH]\n\nRegards and Ciao[/QUOTE]\n[COLOR=#333333]Mubarak Hoo Bro Your very Lucky. i want to purchase this gun with pump where from i can .Is it available in pakistan and its price ???????? guide me about hatsan bt 65 E thanks [/COLOR]', 1, 0, '182.186.112.222', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Your support means everything to us. Constructive Criticism is welcome however, people need to be realistic. You can''t expect "Lexus" finishing on a "Suzuki" when you''re paying "Suzuki" prices. Bear in mind the Suzukis can go places your lexus won''t even dare coming close to.   DSA produces guns that sell in Europe and USA for over 6000 euros each. We don''t even try to market these in Pakistan simply because the Pakistani customer has trouble in valuing a Pakistani product over a Browning, Benelli, Beretta or as such. With the 9mm our goal is to produce something robust that can fulfill the basic needs of a handgun and offer a price point that appeals to the average Pakistani shooter.   Our aim is to bring in better finishes and colour tones in the future on top of our base Turshot model offered at higher prices. Even the base model Trushot offers finishes that are far superior to other handguns well above its price range. Which other gun can you get your hands on that has a scratch resistant frame?

You welcome Sadat bro.\n\nNo, you didn''t quite get me right.\n\nI am not questioning DSA''s capability of being able to manufacture quality stuff. Not at all. I was merely stating that I''d not blindly trust a DSA handgun''s metallurgical standards merely on the background of their satisfactory standards shotguns. \n\nI''d appreciate some abusive tests of their handgun for durability and metallurgical standards. Dipping it in a bit of mud/water and shooting out couple of magazines is not what can satisfy me at least.\n\nAs for the local Darra Beretta. Yes, they can make good ones. But I''ve seen them going to bits too, breaking apart, kabooming in the hands of the users.\n\nAnd I repeat, we''re positive that Daudson''s items will live up to the expectations. Every person has his own criteria for accepting a new weapon. I personally would appreciate some practical demonstration and extensive use/abuse test\n\nI think Daudson will cooperate here. They should. And we should insist they do, since this is going to be for civilian use.\n\nThere would be no pride as that of a successful Pakistani handgun.\n\nOur expertise and skills in the manufacture of weapons is probably better and with a longer history than that of Turkey''s.

Then the ammo started to dry up, and I had my first experience with the hot chinese rounds.  I used to dream about those days when POF ammo was available.  I moved from Chinese to S&B ammo rather quickly as I noticed that the Chinese stuff was very hard on the gun.  S&B gave me the same reliability as the POF ammo used to; however, being a regular shooter the S&B ammo was costing me quite a bit of money at 50/rs a round. \nRecently I went to POF Wah official sales office and acquired 1000 rounds of 1Z pistol ammo sealed crate at a cost of 35/rs each. \n Today I went to the range with my new Sig Para Sport, CZ 75TS, Canik Piranha, and then aside from my guns there were other guns there to shoot from like the Glock 26 & 19, HK P30.  Dr Zakir, Usmanh, and rotorcraft were also present.  \nI must advise everyone here to go out and buy POF 1Z ammo if they want their guns to have the following unique features: \n1. Failure to Feed\n2. Failure to Cycle\n3. Failure to Eject\n4. Failure to Fire\nThis POF ammo takes the first prize in all categories.  I will NEVER buy POF again (meri toba!) what a *^(&^&#$&%^# ammo made by a bunch of *&^&^%&%%^^ people!  I say %#$$@#$&^& this to POF and its ammo.  I will advise everyone I meet from here on out at range NEVER to buy POF ammo.  \nAll the guns in which this ammo was tried - failed.  They all had the same four failures.  If anyone reads this at POF - they need to understand that POF is failing at EVERYTHING not because of lack of funds.  Its failing due to providing guaranteed employment to its staff. :mad2:\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/22d8e120-1431-4c3e-89aa-b7ed48653328.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/cad3ab1e-fb10-43ba-956e-c96bc41f1cc0.jpg[/IMG]', 1, 1, '115.186.153.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

That''s why I stated that both these rounds are "kind of" +P, slightly overcharged.\n\nSo is the Nato round, as per your own source too, operating at 36.5K Psi''s.\n\nIf you need to test with real +P''s, there are 2 ways about it:\n\n1) Find some imported stuff.\n\n2) Find some hand-loaded, pure DESI crap!\n\nWhat a paradox! Lol!\n\nBut I am speaking from experience, that once we fired with fake POF 2Z''s, and trust me, a most senior respectable from our forums kept looking at the CZ999 that he fired from, if everything was perfectly alright with the handgun, lol! There was a hell of a kick with those desi''es, lol!\n\nYet, I think we''d be deviating from the actual matter being discussed.\n\nI''m personally of the view that the Trushot does not need to demonstrate anything with +P rated ammo at all.\n\nWhat''s enough in my opinion is a sustained fire torture test in the range of 4-500 rounds non-stop and with different brands ammo. Most desi weapons will have scruples passing this much even.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nWell if that is the case that all type ammo fired and around 500 rounds then it is an easy and less complicated issue - I hope we have a broad consensus on it? I will be grateful if ALL senior members can comment  and show their TECHNICAL agreement with sir @AK47 and @ LEON.\n\nMy little comments are:\n1. High pressure tests have to show with proving the OVER-STRENGTH confirmation (proof test) and it is sort of Factor of Safety (FOS) over the normal working pressure.\n\n2. A gun with higher proof load will have less chances of FATIGUE based failure over several thousands of rounds fired.  In my opinion if gun has 5000 rounds life then in reality it must be able to take around 10,000 rounds till it fails!!!! FOS = 2\n\n3. Now in light of local ammo and red box ammo as @AK47 said - if these are to be taken as +p rounds then DSA 9mm must be ensured against all odd circumstances of testing in worst condition.

A 40k psi constantly may kill the barrel (& slide possibly) within 500 rounds (or less) instead of 3k+ rounds it should last to as per the % maths applied. I''ve tinkered with increasing engine compression by skimming the head &/or super charging but it is not possible to calculate revised engine life based on just compression figures - one can only take figures from real life experience of multiple engines of same configuration lasting a certain number of miles and then guesstimate! Other components need upgrading too. Turbo boosting without iron sleeving an aluminium FRM lined cylinders wall coated engine will kill it in a very short time, but if one was to go with maths that engine should last at least 30k miles at least (assuming 100k life), not just sub 1k miles it does in reality.\n\n[B]Increasing the stresses almost always results in a much faster rate of component failure/fatigue than rate/% of increase in stress levels.[/B] That''s what I found with engine components (serious engineering goes in to designing engine components of high end naturally aspirated engines that , for example, have 1995 cylinder displacement, rev to 9k rpm and produce 220bhp!) and what every automotive engineer I have met said too. To get a ''safe'' 10% increase in a high end NA 220bhp engine is no small task, and 30k psi to 36k psi is a 20% increase already and we won''t know the tolerances of the barrel until actual engineering data is in front of us.\n\nDetermining Tolerances in engineering is never simple maths.

But I''ve fired from the CZ999 and also from Taurus PT92.\n\nMy impressions were that from my particular hands the CZ999 delivered a lovely scar on the board, whereas my shots from the PT92 were as dead on as my inexpert hands could put them, yet not as close to each other as those from the CZ999.\n\nThis is the reason why I picked the SIG P226 last summer, expecting it to produce similar or better results from my hands.\n\nBoth guns are very good value for money deals, no doubts. (Taurus PT92/99 and EZ9).\n\nLet me be frank with respect to everything discussed here. As collectors we do tend to attach the value spent on a gun to it''s quality and satisfy ourselves with having disbursed out and gained proportionally much on the quality side of the gun. It need not necessarily be so, and let me explain my point a bit more.\n\nThe Taurus handguns like the PT 92/99 and 1911 models are excellent model handguns and were not manufactured to target the Pakistani market as budget substitutes for Beretta 92''s or Colt 1911''s. That they''ve become budget substitutes is merely due to the active pricing mechanisms in our country due to the import restrictions  pending.\n\nThese guns are competing out there with their american counterparts and with little difference in prices. American people have a very critical outlook on quality matters and would have dumped down the Taurus 92''s to $200 even, had their been CONSIDERABLE quality differences. Who''d care for Taurus Life time warranties if these guns had to be dispatched back and forth to the company for corrections/replacements on regular basis? The people over there are regular shooters and like to visit the range couple of times every week with an ok handgun, rather than handling under warranty package mails to and from the company every week or so, just because they spent some petty $40 less initially on a Taurus over the Beretta.\n\nI''m sure someone may have a question for me that why I picked a SIG over a CZ999 now, but let me assure you there''s one heck of a difference in the manufacturing quality between a SIG and a CZ999, yet not quite so between a PT92 and Beretta 92 wrt to internal/external finishing, etc.\n\nThe major issue with Taurus is as Den stated rightly, the occasional QC problem. This is the occasional benefit that the american user has with the Taurus Warranty, but I''m sure, even if you write to Taurus about the number of PT92/99/1911 complaints and warranty services dealt with on monthly/yearly basis, you''ll find the number of complaints dealt with for these specific models to be significantly/dramatically lower than that for other Taurus handguns.\n\nYet irrespective of all these things, I''d still not go to the extent of calling a Taurus a Beretta. A Taurus is a Taurus, a Beretta is a Beretta.\n\nKindly do not mind grametical errors in my verticts. No offence, lolz! We''re all mature people.\n\nLoved the debate. It just should have remained confined to the technics.\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.188.152.42', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The bullet jumps on firing and smashes into the forcing cone of the barrel and then propelled forward.\nIn case of heavier calibers like the .357 and the 44 magnum the frame and the forcing cone of the barrel comes into great stress, there are high speed videos on U Tube showing how much the frame stretches.\nThe .22 and .32 S&W also go through punishment but at a very reduced scale comparitively.\nThe maxim a Cheap Revolver will always be more accurate than a Cheap pistol may be doubt full.\nHow ever even a moderately well made revolver can be compared in accuracy with pricey top end Pistols in accuracy. This is my take and open to discussion.[/QUOTE]\n\nSir, what you have explained I got each and every part of it becuase you turned professional terminologies into simple understandable words. Thanks for nice reply sir once again.\n\nI got good pistols if not very high end ones so in my case I do not need a Revolver just to increase accuracy which I understood is not going to improve very much say if 5% improvement what is the gain in it.\n\nAs advised by other fellow Pakgun members I saw a lot of videoson youtube on basic tecniques i.e., stance, grip, trigger etc. there were few mistakes not that much but I will try to rectify them. \n\nAnd one more thing I keep on bringing different handguns to range. Idea is to get ONE best most comfortable handgun consistently to range every weekend with quality ammo in my case CZ75B Stainless with S&B ammo. Accuracy will definitely improve.\n\nOne very strange thing I do shoot well at 50 Meters the max possible range distance available at LRC ( I have posted the target pictures in the 9mm thread ). Here I am posting them again all shots fired at 50 meters ( not yards ) with a couple of shots not missing the target altogether\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]27629[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]27628[/ATTACH]\n\nBut when it comes to 15 meters and 25 meters I cannot get a decent group even of a couple of inches. \n\nSir, reason for this discrepency in accuracy at different distances i cannot figure out any suggestions will be highly appreciated\n\nRegards', 1, 0, '182.189.58.155', 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
