I believe that every citizen of Pakistan deserves the right to keep two weapons if he so chooses.\n\nThe procedure of obtaining a license should be easy and transparent. For example every ID card number should have legislation backing it which allows two guns (a handgun (pistol, revolver) and a shotgun). Buying a gun should be a matter of walking into a gun shop, filling in a form, getting your ID card and identity verified (biometric scanner), the gun registered with NADRA online and walk away with your new purchase.\n\nAnother better way is that only those ID card owners who have passed a Government of Pakistan appointed training session of Firearm usage and Safety be enabled to buy a FireArm. This ensures the Government only puts firearms in the hands of citizens who actually are trained in their usage and practice Gun Safety. This is also quite beneficial in times of war etc as you effectively have voluntary conscription. In difficult times the Government has a record of trained citizens with their own firearms ready to help the Government defend the country.\n\nGun control and banning guns from society is a Utopian dream and a western phenomena, it has no place in Muslim culture.

If the trainees are expected to pay for themselves then it automatically excludes low income groups. If the government pays for training then they just won''t have the resources to offer it to everyone interested. Perhaps they could have repeated infotainment type programs on TV/Radio to educate people on gun safety, that could be more feasible.\nI tend to agree with the idea of allowing two NPB weapons to each CNIC holder who just needs to register the weapon thereafter. Have a condition that one of them needs to be Pakistani made to stimulate local industry and reduce import bills. Anyone wanting more than the basic 2 needs to obtain licenses.\nIMHO the one mistake I think people make is to expect any of the ''solutions'' to wipe out crime. This will not happen - period. It could stop a certain type of crime but mutate into other types.  So allowing some basic self defense ability to all plus repeated training on TV/radio on all gun aspects could bring some improvement I think.\nOn carrying: It should not be allowed for everywhere. When you restrict it for some places then it becomes similar to what we have now. When you ban it it becomes like Sec 144. i don''t know if there are other choices, but what we have now seems to be in the larger public interest just because the other two are too extreme.', ''),

(2702, ' The first hollow-point bullets were marketed in the late 1800s as Express bullets, and were hollowed out to reduce the bullet''s mass and provide higher velocities. In addition to providing increased velocities, the hollow also turned out to provide significant expansion, especially when the bullets were cast in a soft lead alloy. Originally intended for rifles, the popular .32-20, .38-40 and .44-40 calibers could also be fired in revolvers. With the advent of smokeless powder, velocities increased, and bullets got smaller, faster, and lighter. These new bullets (especially in rifles) needed to be jacketed to handle the conditions of firing. The new full metal jacket bullets tended to penetrate straight through a target and produce little damage. This led to the development of the soft point bullet and later jacketed hollow-point bullets at the British arsenal in Dum Dum, near Calcutta INDIA around 1890. Designs included the .303" Mk III, IV & V and the .455" Mk III "Manstopper" cartridges.\n\nsource vikipedia \ncan also get it confirmed from technical dept of POF \nmany of the initial workers were transferred from indian ordnance factories', ''),

A pump gun is typically fed from a tubular magazine underneath the barrel, which also serves as a guide for the pump.\n\nREPEATER:\nGas, inertia, or recoil operated actions are other popular methods of increasing the rate of fire of a shotgun; these are generally referred to as autoloaders or semi-automatics. Instead of having the action manually operated by a pump or lever, the action automatically cycles each time the shotgun is fired, ejecting the spent shell and reloading a fresh one into the chamber.', ''),

(2981, ' I posted it a while ago on TFL. Now wanted to share this story with u guys here:\n\n*********\nOk, this happened some 5-6 years back at my home. I was a student in university at that time. So one night I went to sleep at 3:30 AM after surfing net & chatting etc. Around 4:30, I was awaken by my mom who told me in a panicked voice that some one was in the home. I jumped off the bed and went to investigate.\n\nLet me give u the idea of my that single story house. It was on a 230sq. yards with a side & front un covered area. rest was the covered area. The front consisted of the car porch, stairs to the roof & veranda. The window of my parents bedroom opens in the porch & door & window of the Drawing room in the veranda. Since the veranda was well lit, I could see some shadows moving from the breech of the door. I was never into such a situation & my head started spinning. My dad was out of city & I was with my mom & 2 younger sisters.\n\nAnyway, I went to mom''s room & tried to see from the window. I didnt have the view because of angle but the window glasses gave me enough reflection of two guys trying to break in through the drawing room window. My head started to spin faster, I just didnt know what to do. I didnt even have a firearm @ that time. Suddenly, it occured to me to use my car''s anti burglary siren. I rushed to pick up the remote, came back & hit the panic button. The siren went off & the 2 BGs just dashed towards the 7 ft. wall & crossed it over. A 3rd BG , abt which I wasn''t aware of until then, was on the roof & he too ran away.\n\nIn the heat of all this, It didnt occur to any of us to use the telephone or cell. So after it I tried to make a call to police & my uncles but the line was dead. so used the mobile phone & informed the concerns. Police came, inspected what the BGs were doing near the DR''s window & it appeared that the iron grill was just one screw away & was literally hanging on it. Means, If I had waited for the cops to arrive or relied only on them, they would have been inside well before the police could show up. Here the response time could be anywhere from 15 mins to indefinitely :P The 3rd BG on the roof had the telephone line cut. I can just thank God for it because it was very very lucky for us to thwart this invasion. btw, this would have their (BGs) 2nd robbery in the street since a house was looted on gun point just 3 days ago same time most probably by the same goons.\n\nI now own a 9 mm & a 12 GA but I m still not sure what would be my response if God forbid something like that happens again. , Will I be able to use the gun properly, how abt trembling hands & so many other factors. I just can''t describe the situation & I bet that I wasn''t in my complete senses.\nI really believe it was for my mom as it was her prayer time & she has a habit to check out doors & windows whenever she gets up & had she been a little late in that, things would have gone differently. The trend shows most home invaders r too trigger happy & violent. Some r reported to be polite enough but how would u know?.\n\n*************\n\ncomments etc r welcome, so is ur own such experience etc.\nThanks for bearing the long post', ''),

All that changed when i read this..\n\nPotential Problems with Wolf Ammunition\n\n[edit] Lacquer coating\n\nWolf no longer manufactures ammunition with a lacquer coating on the cartridge casing due to issues concerning lacquer-coated steel cartridges becoming stuck in the chamber of a firearm after firing, with difficulty in ejecting the spent cartridge afterwards. This appears to be more of a problem with cartridges with narrowly tapering walls (e.g. .223 Remington) than those with rather steep case walls such as 7.62x39 mm cartridges or pistol ammunition. This also does not seem to pose much of a problem for Soviet or East Bloc designed weapons that tend to have looser chamber tolerances than Western designed weapons.\n\nTests have shown that steel-cased Wolf cases do not obturate sufficiently to form a good gas seal against the chamber [2] when compared to brass-cased ammunition. As a result, when Wolf cartridges are fired, some of the combustion by-products are deposited between the case and the chamber, causing a build up of carbon that is well in excess of normal. Firing a brass case (that does expand fully) after using Wolf ammunition can result in the brass case being "glued" into the chamber by the carbon buildup. This issue has nothing to do with the lacquer coating vaporising or melting, as has mistakenly been suggested. The problem is one of carbon deposition, which creates the same end result i.e. a stuck cartridge that has jammed in the chamber. It is important to emphasise that Wolf ammunition is perfectly safe to use because it conforms to all SAAMI standards. However, it is recommended that firearms are thoroughly cleaned after using Wolf ammunition due to the increased rate of carbon build-up within the chamber. Most users are content to accept increased rates of gun cleaning in return for being able to purchase more ammunition per dollar. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the looser chamber dimensions of Soviet designed weapons allow for more room during firing and extraction. Soviet or East Bloc weapons do not experience these problems.\n\nNote: all ammunition currently manufactured by Wolf has polymer-coated or brass cartridge cases and any obturation problems have been radically reduced.\n\n[edit] Steel cases\n\nDespite popular misconception, steel-cased ammunition does not increase wear on the chamber or extractor of firearms. This is because the steel used in cartridge cases is mild steel which is very soft in comparison to the type of steel used in firearm components. Also, steel cases are often given a thin coating of lacquer or polymer, so there is no direct steel-to-steel contact with the chamber. The only disadvantage to using steel cases is that steel is not as "elastic" as brass, and therefore does not create as efficient a gas seal when a fire-arm is fired.\n\n[edit] Steel-jacketed bullets\n\nNot only the cases of Wolf rifle ammo are steel. Most of Wolf''s rifle cartridges use steel jacketed bullets, though they look like copper jacketed. The copper exterior of the bullet is only about .005 inch thick, (about twice the thickness of a sheet of paper) with a steel jacket underneath about 1/32 inch thick. Only the cartridges in the yellow and black boxes, which have become almost unavailable as of 2/08, have real copper jackets. The core of the steel jacketeted bullets, sometimes marked "bimetal", are lead. Some rifle ranges have started magnet testing shooter''s ammunition to determine if bullets are steel jacketed. The steel is said to be more likely to ricochet, and also to cause sparks on impact, which can be a problem when shooting in dry grassland, or forest areas.', ''),

The sheer amount of work required along with technical issues was a strong deterrent but to continue our cycle of growth and to take our place in the international gun community an upgrade was essential. \n\nWe MashAllah now have the world best forum software running on some of the world''s best servers. \n\nI will let members discover the new software on their own, they will find that they now have at their disposal all the options that they asked for and more. A massive reorganization of the forum itself is also in place, for example the previous Handguns section which had over 900 threads has been cleaned and divided into 7 subsections by calibers to make the required data easy to find. Similarly two new sections have been added to PakGuns which were long required and requested. They are:\n\n1). [B]Competitive Shooting and Accuracy Thread[/B]\n\n2). [B]Weapons of the World Militaries[/B] \n\nSince the focus of PakGuns has always been sports shooting, an independent Competitive shooting section was required. \n\nI had been noticing a lot of interest from members in the past two years regarding military weapons and their discussion, the World Militaries section is dedicated to them. Please keep in mind the World Militaries section is for discussion only, [B][U]no questions regarding availability of anything posted in this section is allowed[/U][/B]. Moderators have been instructed to award an instant ban for asking about availability of P.B / Auto weapons. [B]Our interest is purely academic[/B]. \n\nWhile there are many new features, two important ones stand out. They are [B]Articles and Blogs[/B]. \n\nNow good reviews from the forum will be auto promoted as articles on our Front Page, I have already upgraded some posts to articles which can be seen in the main section. This way over time we can have a complete database of firearms as articles instead of visitors having to go through the forums searching threads for things they need. \n\nBlogs: Are a personal webpage for Senior members within PakGuns. We are still working over the details on which users get their own blogs but for now the criteria is a minimum of 2000 posts. Here they can share with the community their knowledge and experiences. \n\nFinally, my aim with PakGuns was always to make a strong, united and educated gun community and once it had grown to a certain level to hand over the day to day running to leaders within that community. I am happy to announce that we have 4 new moderators at PakGuns who will InshAllah take PakGuns forward. They are:\n\n1). [B]Denovo87[/B]\n2). [B]12Guage[/B]\n3). [B]Starfish [/B](Special thanks for helping me out with new software setup!)\n4). [B]Vik[/B]\n\n[B]Taurus [/B]and [B]Heimdall [/B]will stay on as moderators and [B]Ka_Khan [/B]will retain his position as [B]Super Mod[/B] 			. In total we now have 7 mods so I can finally go on a permanent vacation and enjoy the forum as any other PakGunner. :)\n\n[B]Problems Logging in ?[/B] When the forum was migrated we lost all password and avatar data as expected. Please reset your password by getting it emailed to the addresses that you registered with. This is done by trying to login to PakGuns, it will give you an error message saying " invalid username or password", click forgot your password, it will take you to another screen, give your email address that you registered with. It will send you an email on that address with instructions on how to reset your password. In case of any problems, email me at [EMAIL="Abbas@PakGuns.com"]Abbas@PakGuns.com[/EMAIL]. \n\nAlso I would like to say that forum migration was a tough task and since the software is new for us all we might experience some bugs/problems. If you find any please let us know and we will try to rectify it asap. \n\n\nEnjoy & Welcome Back !\n\nAbbas', 'Welcome to the New PakGuns !'),

I personally am involved in having work done on all this machinery.  INFACT most if the installed capacity at part manufacturers is currently being utilised at ONLY 20% due to slowdown in the auto specific sector.  \n\nPrimarily it is all about Process Management and training workers/ mangers and above all the investors.  The mfg is not an issue and nor are volumes.  \n\nWhat it takes it the willingness of buyers to trust the locally produced item.  If the MP 5 , and other weapons are already being produced in Pak then all other stuff can be done so at the current volumes.  \n\nThe best way to always go about making new products is to go for JVs ( Joint ventures) .

In Pakistan besides POF no manufacturer except DSA has resources to invest that kind of money.\n\nBesided monetary resources, the most important resource is highly trained, highly skilled technicians specific to this industry. Remember for original work we must have capable engineers who can design and produce their own weapons, not just make clones/copies.\n\nThird most important thing is the availability of high quality material production and testing facilities, which unfortunately are not present in Pakistan. Even POF is simply producing german designs on mostly HK machines, I''m not sure but probably their material is also imported.\n\nSD/HD is the area where you don''t take chances, I''m a very patriotic person, but when it comes to SD/HD equipment I''ll get something which is reliable, accurate, and durable.

(4165, ' As far as I know, under the Pakistan Penal Code, you are authorised to take someone''s life in self defense only if "they enter your premises with intent to cause harm".  Intent can be discerned through the guy wielding a weapon etc.  \n\nWhen you are not at your premises i.e. home, you are not covered by this law.  In our laws, we do not have a clear self defense provision to begin with and if you kill someone, besides his cronies coming after you, there is a high likelihood of a murder case against you.\n\nOmkhan - I dont think our laws are flexible with respect to third party or property defense.  As far as I know, we have no provision for third party defense which is why most security companies shy away from authorising their guards for shoot to kill. They can only shoot to kill when their own life is threatened.  \n\nTo clarify the meaning of third party defense; South Africa probably has the best laws in this regard and despite that the crime rate is very high.  The law there is very simple, if you kill someone / anyone to save another persons life, you are legally covered.  Hence good private security firms in South Africa are more or less mercenary armies.', ''),

Use of guns for safety and recreational use (hunting etc.) is totally lost or gets hidden due high crime rate (using guns). That is because some people gives excuse of having guns as "safety" and "hunting" but in fact the main purpose is either revenge or crime. \n\nIt is become stereotypical sign in Pakistan that a person carrying gun is bad a$$ and must be involve in crime, the one way or other.\n\nThat''s where PakGuns.com comes in the scene. We need to make ourselves distinctive from these criminals. We need to tell the world (in Pakistan and outside Pakistan) that like all other countries, in Pakistan too, there are sensible people who knows the value of gun and own it only for safety and/or use it for recreational purposes. That can only be done by marking a clear line between us and criminal use of guns. \n\nWe need to voice ourselves that not everybody who owns gun is a criminal. We are also have family, respect humanity and love peace (not in Miss World style). :)\n\nPlease share your thoughts. I am waiting for your thoughts and replies. :)', ''),

(4225, ' [b]Salams,[/b]\n\n[b]We need to write a little booklet to dispel some of the gun paranoia and guns=bad stereotype in Pakistan. There is a lot of misinformation out there. Please write your suggestions to include in the booklet/pamphlet. [/b]\n\n[b]Currently I am thinking along these lines. This is a sample of the kind of text that I want to include, it''s from the FAQ in the articles section. Please feel free to add information. [/b]\n\n\nQ). What are the different types of Guns ? What kind can a Pakistani Citizen keep ?\n\nA). There are 5 major types of guns. Pistols, Revolvers, Shotguns, Rifles & Machine Guns.\n\nIn Pakistan all pistols and revolvers, shotguns and .22 rifles are allowed. Automatic weapons are prohibited to the general public unless a special license is granted.\n\n\nQ). Aren''t Guns Dangerous ?\n\nA). Guns are NOT DANGEROUS ! While they should be treated with respect they should not be feared. Gun related deaths are outnumbered by automobile related deaths by a ratio of 10 to 1 specially in Pakistan. In modern times firearms have reached an excellent safety level. Usually there are at least two safeties on every weapon and if treated with diligence the chances of an accident are extremely slim. Gun owners with small children in the house should never keep their firearms chambered and preferably keep the weapon and ammunition in separate locked places.\n\n\nQ).  Why are weapons so loud ? Do all weapons make the same amount of noise ?\n\nA). When a gun is fired, the gunpowder inside the bullet essentially explodes which in turn propels the bullet forward though the barrel. That exploding gunpowder makes most of the noise. Generally the larger the bullet/cartridge, the more the gunpowder it has hence the louder the sound. The weapon itself also plays a factor and the speed of the bullet breaking the sound barrier is the cause of the loud ''crack'' sound. The sound can be muffled in small arms by attaching a silencer at the end of the barrel. If you''re shooting for sport, use ear protection. It will save you from going deaf in the long run.  \n\n\nQ). Do I need really need a weapon ? What kind ?\n\nA). In my opinion every household should have at least two weapons. A handgun (Pistol/Revolver) and a Shotgun. Both are multipurpose, can be used for self defense as well as sport. \n\n\nQ). Can I carry my gun around with me ? Is it legal ?\n\nA). It is subject to debate as it is a bit of a grey area but generally the answer is No. You should not carry your gun on your person unless there is a real threat to your security. Carrying firearms to show off, feel important or to appear macho is just plain idiotic and childish. You are a responsible adult that is why you were issued a firearms license, carrying without need is asking for trouble. \n\n\nThe 10 rules for firearm safety\n \n\nHunting and target shooting are among the safest of all sports. Part of the reason is that young and new shooters are introduced properly by responsible adults. The following 10 rules for firearm safety are passed along from shooter to shooter and keep us all safe in the field.\n\n\n1. Always keep the muzzle pointed In a safe direction and Never point the muzzle at anything you are not willing to destroy.\n2. Firearms should be unloaded when not actually in use but be always treated as loaded.\n3. Don`t rely on your gun`s "Safety".\n4. Never shoot at a hard surface, or at water -- your shot may glance off, ricochet and injure someone.\n5. Use correct ammunition.\n6. If your gun fails to fire when the trigger is pulled, handle with care!\n7. Always wear eye and ear protection when shooting.\n8. Never joke around or engage in horseplay while handling or using firearms\n9. Don`t alter or modify your gun, and service your guns regularly.\n10. In the event of a misfire, keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction, remove your finger from the trigger, wait ten seconds, take the magazine out and eject the cartridge.', ''),

You attach a photocopy of the purchase receipt and submit it to the Arms Branch in F-8 court area along with original purchase receipt.

In that case you will need a valid import license. It is on this import permit that the dealer in Hong Kong will sell you the required weapon. He might want to verify the same from the Pakistan Foreign Mission  in Hong Kong \n\nThen at the HK airport you should also in advance inform the Customs people that you will be carrying a shot gun on the flight in the check in luggage. Do this atleast 48 hrs in advance to avoid any hassles.\n\nIn Pakistan prefer to have a contact in Customs pre arranged to receive and clear. No issues legally either if you donot as you will have a valid import permit. Remember to have the Purchase Receipt also and be ready to pay the tax but usually this is not paid. As per law it should be but sometimes the system is exploited or the CBR gives an exemption---import permits issued to members of parliament, armed forces officers, members of the pakistan shooting team etc are exempt.\n\nIn transfer of residence also, you will need the same import license.

No new applications for arms licenses would be received and entertained before March 1, sources in Interior Ministry said here on Monday.\n\nThe section dealing with issuance of arms licenses is running short of staff, besides an unusual increase in the demand for arms licenses and this forced the ministry to stop entertaining new applications, sources told Business Recorder.\n\nThe ministry has got strict orders from its chief (Advisor on Interior) regarding disposing of the pending applications, they said, adding that following the directives from Advisor on Interior, the Ministry has stopped entertaining new applications and people are asked to approach after March 1.\n\nWhen asked about earlier announcement of February 15, they said that the ministry had stopped entertaining application for new arms license till February 15 but the date has now been extended owing to backlog. During the last two years the ministry has issued about 178,754 arms licenses of non-prohibited bore (NPB) out of which 2,788 arms licenses, were issued by the present government.\n\nMeanwhile, they said that the Advisor to the Prime Minister on Interior, Rehman Malik, has directed the ministry to issue a new arms licenses only after due verification of the applicant from Nadra and other relevant organisations.\n\nHowever, Advisor on Interior has directed the concerned department to ensure the verification before issuing license, as many complaints had been received that the arms licenses were being issued to the influential people without proper verification, the sources said.\n\nThey said that the arms licenses are being issued on the recommendations of parliamentarians and there is no quota restriction in this regard and Ministry of Interior is issuing authority of the arms licenses. The sources added that the ministry had already stopped issuing computerised arms licenses and new licenses were issued manually.\n\n[url]http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?id=891351&currPageNo=2&query=&search=&term=&supDate=[/url]', ''),

(4773, ' Just information on the NPB Rifle license is as follows:\n\n- On a NPB license any NPB caliber weapon can be bought as long as it is not a semi automatic. For a semi automatic the only option is .22. As such, any bolt action is legal on a NPB. Sometimes, your relationship with a dealer will play a part. As long as the license is not suspect, credentials of the buyer are ok then there should be no issue.\n\n- For NPB licenses issued before 1989, you can own any NPB  caliber in either semi automatic or bolt action. (This obviously excludes service calibers such as 5.56 or 7.62). Infact, even if the license is a duplicate of one issued before the ''Only 22 semi auto condition'' the Home Ministry is bound to honor the original issue date of the license. Case in point is my own license where though the book says in print that only a .22 semi auto is allowed the home ministry made a notation that since license is a duplicate of a pre-1989 license a 222 or 223 can be bought and possessed by the licensee.\n\nThe condition of only a 22 semi auto was introduced later on when proliferation of semi auto rifles and licenses was extensive.\n\nI would advise members that if they ortheir parents have an old license (before 1989) then they value it and keep it safe. Also, in many cases these old licenses (esp for our grand parents or parents generations) will have .22 bolt actions on them. Its better to transfer those rifles to new licenses and keep the older one either free or for use for semi auto rifles.\n\nHope this helps clarify some questions.', ''),

Unless, you''re in this business of VIP close protection and trained to be that quick, there is actually no point in it. Having seen SSG operatives closely while on duty even they would hesitate to have one in the chamber. I have seen an officer being dressed down by the OIC of the Guard detail for having one in the chamber. Though the same officer was appreciated by Pres. Musharraf when he asked to see his Glock while the officer was part of the President''s detail in KHI! Maverick.....\n\nPolice Officers the world over would never have a round in the chamber, Soldiers on regular duty also will not-and will only be asked to chamber "lock and load" only minutes before action. If you are still in the habit of going armed and with one in the chamber do develop good safety habits such as: Never handing your pistol to friends, ejecting and rechecking your weapon before handing to anyone and repeat after taking back. Even if the person claims they have made the weapon ''safe''. \n\nAlso, safe hunting practice would mean that you never have one in the chamber, carry your side-by-side open when walking etc.\n\nRemember all accidents are preventable!', ''),

(4886, ' FP, point taken about having a live one in the chamber. Saves time...but like i said one in the chamber should only be for people who are well trained either in close quarter protection or in a situation where they know they''re entering a hostile environment. My advice is relevant for amatuers only who should not have one in the chamber-either when driving or in a social environment. Also, increasingly I am seeing hand guns in thehands of totally inexperienced boys. I myself have seen boys who had never held a firearm in their life and who''s families have no experience with weapons, simply geting into their SUV''s outside their home shouting at each other to take their pistols out and load cos its late. (eithr to impress their friends or to put their weapons to some use---cos for as far as i could see there was no threat--clearly lit street, no car for 300 yards etc.). Also, i am not a supporter of arms licenses getting into hands of people who are juts willing to pay 18-20 k to dealers liek DAAD and getting their hands on pistols without any prior training, parental supervision or even for the need of a weapon. I for one would not like to e in a mile of a bunch of folks like that. \n\n\nObviously, I guess for someone with extensive experience with weapons and having one in the chamber will be a personal choice and  (like Firepower...) and with them i''d still feel safe if i knew they were carrying a live weapon. Similar to the officer who had one in the chamber and that''s ok. My personal opinion on taht situation was that to have one in the chamber was the right decision...there was a clear and present threat. I myself on occassion have had one in the chamber but only cos the situation demanded it.\n\nForums like this should actually help inculcate safe firearm practices esp for new comers.\n\nI like the comment that "PakGuns officially recommends NOT to carry your firearm chambered"\n\nAlso, my two bits on Army personnel not having a live one in the chamber: Yes a regular infantry soldier will not even cary a secondary weapon..his primary would be his rifle and that too not live. A soldier on protection duty will have a secondary firearm as on perimeter duty he would be carrying a rifle. The close quarter protection detail will have a Handgun keeping both hands free for reaction and crowd control. (they might choose to have one in teh chamber dependent on the briefing for the day and tehir perception of the threat)\n\nDidn''t mean to offend anyone with their choice of having one in the chamber--as long as the decision is based on the correct threat perception, ability to handle the situation, training etc. And by the looks of it members like FP, Balazona and others are mature enough to decide when to have one live and when not!\n\nGood discussion people....', ''),
(4887, ' Sorry about the year of .22 Condition.....and thanks for the correction!', ''),
(4888, ' I have been thinking on this from last few days. My suggestion is to put a section "self-defense using gun under law". This is very important and many people are confuse or have little knowledge about it. \n\nFor that we need to consult with at least one or two (better to consult more lawyers to confirm things) criminal lawyers. For example, if some robber broke into a home then how the home owner can use his legal gun to protect himself and his family. Can he shoot on chest of robbers? On back of robbers? I mean from legal point of view because after the incident it will become police case and eventually it will go to court. \n\nWe should give awareness to people what is self defense and what is not, from legal point of view.\n\nSecondly, we should give knowledge about crime scene. Never ever touch anyone''s gun. Never handle/touch robber''s gun (which they have left). Let police investigate the crime scene and let them collect evidence.\n\nFurthermore, we should also give a list of good criminal lawyers by city, just in case some gun owner used his gun to protect himself and his family (self-defense) then at that time everything is very confusing and at that time they need a good criminal lawyer. \n\nThese are just drafts of mere suggestions. What do you guys think of them?', ''),

(4892, ' [quote]Also, increasingly I am seeing hand guns in thehands of totally inexperienced boys.[/quote]\n\nNazeer, I agree. However the problem is control. How do we achieve that at? There is already so much red tape and bribes in place that any more regulation will only mean more bribe that is all. \n\nUnless we get highly paid branch of officers who run proper training schools whose passing certificate becomes a pre-requisite for license I dont see how we train and control them.\n\nAnother problem is lack of training schools and firing ranges. We dont have access to any....the government is too busy making money on everything, let alone remotely thinking of what they should be actually doing.\n\nLack of schools and firing ranges are resulting into accidents, either from negligent discharges or from havai firing at various places. \n\nEverything is so elitist around here. Look at Islamabad Gun Club. The membership fee is 6 lacs. I can afford that if I want, but I CHOOSE not pay some idiots to join their stupid club, unless they offer me for free;)\n\nThe membership fee is keeping real enthusiasts and experienced folks out and only kids with money or ones that want to show off in. I have seen at least ten of their memberships with people who dont even like guns. This is the crowd which got it to impress others or trying to be part of the upper class.\n\nThis is typical in every scenario not just exclusive to gun club. There used to be a play ground near F6 Markaz. It was a nice place for kids (most from under privilliged class) to come, play and enjoy themselves. Now there is a sports complex there. Very nice with new stuff and an entry fee of some sort- thus exlcuding those who were playing there before. I see now rich kids and some foreigners playing basketball and tennis there. I ticks me off just seeing that...needless to say what it does to those who used to play there. Any guess what those Madrasa kids are thinking now and DOING instead? Dont get me started on that. \n\nIn nutshell, I agree with Nazeer''s post. However, I am not sure where we begin to fix things. Any ideas? \n\nAnd yes, perhaps you should not take gun loaded unless you have a proper training. Remember the time when you did not have gun and you difused the situation without using a weapon. Weapon is a last resort not a recreational contraption. \n\n\nBe safe and enjoy your guns. Just be responsible.', ''),

It looks standard size shotgun because of fiber stock otherwise its barrel is less than 22" i.e. by any means not a hunting barrel length as the pellets tend to spread very quickly unable to create a good pattern beyond 35 meters. Only SG or #4 excel is effective after that due to larger grain size carrying more knockdown power. Injuring an animal or bird by shooting it from a longer distance is never recommended by the hunting community, it should be killed humanely for consumption or even otherwise. Most dry land birds, other than water inhabitants, are usually shot within 35-50 meters.\n\nAs everything thing is made to serve a certain purpose, DSA pump-actions are primarily for HD & guards and they are good for that. Limited hunting with it is an additional advantage. Hope it clarifies.', ''),

(4896, ' Yes, what would be needed is not more regulation but a streamlining of the regulation so that the process is not exploited. Also, the departments would need to be revamped and staffed with personnel who are better trained and have a higher motivation than a quick buck. Also, again in personal experience the corruption many times is not with the decision maker but people down the ladder such as the gatekeepers, PA''s, office staff and such.\n\nSorry, the post has gone off topic but it juts drifted that way.\n\nGun Clubs memberships should also be much cheaper and more accessible--the PN one in KHi actually is very affordable esp for students and the only hitch or something that takes long is the Naval Intelligence Clearance. Islamabad Gun Club is elitist in nature. It would be really cool if we did have Gun Schools (teaching shooting, use of firearms etc) etc like they have in the US. \n\nMaybe that is something the Forum should try and achieve. BTW what is the harm in approaching the Gun Club with a proposal like that. It once had good people as its patron-some from the armed forces and pakistan sports board. Maybe the Isld people could take that on.\n\nIn the end just to be back on topic, one in the chamber is only a matter of choice and the new firearm designs actually make it safe to do so.

Few minutes later another police vehicle came and enquired if i had fired any shots? I replied positively. they asked me about the licence and the person in whose name it was registered.\n\nIn the light of the above it is advisable to have your licence registerd in case you happen to shoot some one inside your house, an unregisterd weapon/ license will create lots of problems.\n\nIf you have a legal licence, do register it.', ''),

(5306, ' Nice discussion. I was trained in gun handling by my father when I was 8. I have seen and heard stories of accidental discharge way too often. In my view the decision to carry a gun in condition one should be made based on the nature, extent, and perception of threat. However, these days the ''nature'' of the threat has changed significantly. For instance, many a times the kidnappers or robbers actually storm the house of the victim i.e. 10/15 highly trained people with loaded assault rifles and a clear intent to take lives in case of any minute threat to their own safety. Since these events are happening with a much higher frequency, therefore the ''perception'' of threat has changed as well. Now how can a commoner with just a little bit of handgun training can coupe with this situation? May be the answer lies in the readiness. Moreover, it''s not just the question of carrying a loaded gun; one should also have training in quick draw, target acquisition under severe stress, and physical maneuvering. \n\nPolice and/or army personnel in their own country are not trained from a victim''s point of view, at least it was not the case until recently in Pakistan. Moreover the breach of security parameter gives them a significant warning. Hence I would not take any references to their practices of carrying a loaded or otherwise gun.\n\nNow if I were to express my personal view here, I would always attempt a counter attack instead of capitulation. It is still better than getting kidnapped and going through the hell later. Given this inbred, firm decision, I would always carry a round in the chamber, with safety on.\n\nAs far the rich-kids are concerned, their behavior is a by-product of the action movies and improper parental control. We see this behavior in reckless driving, and other so many counter-social instances. People, and regardless of age, will always pay for not respecting a gun. I have seen this way too often to believe in it.', ''),

At PNS Karsaz I can talk to the OIC and i think he can arrange a session on basic shooting for members and guests from one of the instructors there. Again this would be basic safety and just basic shooting style and instruction\n\n2. At the Police Elite Training School in Razzakabad again a small session can be arranged but this would perhaps only be a demo for a large group.\n\nFor proper weapons trainibg I doubt that any of the govt organisation Police, PN (Shooting Range, SSGN or Marines), Army etc would accomodate a large group.

Sometimes correct assesment of a situation is the best defence without even firing a sinlge bullet. Second we are all humans, and all prone to making mistakes.

(5492, ' Choosing your ammo is as important as choosing your weapon. Choose wisely, these descriptions should help.\n\nThe following basic ammo types are listed in order of armor penetration, best to worst.\n\nArmor Piercing - A hard bullet made from steel or tungsten alloys in a pointed shape typically covered by a thin layer of lead and/or a copper/brass jacket. The lead and jacket are intended to prevent barrel wear from the hard core materials. For game play purposes, AP is slightly worse on unarmored targets than FMJ. This is to indicate the hard AP projectiles'' tendency not to deform or reliably tumble/yaw.\n\nFMJ - Full Metal Jacket - Made with a lead core surrounded by a full covering of brass, copper, or mild steel. These have very little deformation or expansion, but will occasionally yaw/tumble. FMJ is a good choice when you don''t know what you will be fighting or possibly if you will be going up against a mix of armor types.\n\nJSP - Jacketed Soft Point - In the late 1800s, the Indian Army arsenal at Dum Dum, near Calcutta, developed a variation of the FMJ design where the jacket did not cover the nose of the bullet. The soft lead nose was found to still expand in flesh while the remaining jacket still prevented lead fouling in the barrel. For game play purposes, JSP is roughly splitting the difference between FMJ and JHP. It gives more penetration than JHP but has more stopping power than the FMJ.\n\nJHP - Jacketed Hollow Point - Soon after the invention of the JSP, Woolwich Arsenal in Great Britain experimented with this design even further by forming a hole or cavity in the nose of the bullet while keeping most of the exterior profile intact. These bullets could theoretically deform even faster and expand to a larger diameter than the JSP. Best used against unarmored targets only, the JHP also has the least over penetration so it is ideal for use around hostages.\n\nGlaser Safety Slug - The Glaser Safety Slug dates back to the early ''70s. The inventor Col. Jack Cannon named it for his friend Armin Glaser. Over the years, the projectiles have evolved from crude, hand-produced examples to mass-production; however, the basic concept has remained the same: copper jackets filled with bird shot and cover by a crimped polymer end cap. Upon impact with flesh, the projectile fragments, with the birdshot spreading like a minature shotgun pattern.\n\nThe standard ''Blue'' Glaser uses a rather fine birdshot which only gives 5 to 6" of penetration in flesh. The ''Silver'' Glaser adds another 1 to 2" of penetration with the use of slightly larger birdshot. Due to the much reduced penetration in flesh, some have theorized that the Glaser would be ideal where over-penetration of a projectile could be hazardous to bystanders. For instance, the Glaser may be stopped by a muscular or upraised arm. However, for the same reasons, the Glaser’s terminal performance can vary dramaticly, producing impressive successes and equally spectacular failures depending on the angle at which the target is struck.\n\nGlancing hits on hard surfaces will result in fragmentation, reducing the risk of ricochets. However, the Glaser can penetrate barriers such as drywall, plywood, and thin sheet metal if struck directly. The Blue and Silver Glaser handgun loads are worthless against body armor, penetrating only 5 layers of Kevlar.\n\nTraining Ammo - The training ammo is portrayed as a cross between the FX paint cartridges like Simunitions and long range simulators like the laser-based MILES. It is intended more for clan practice, and is not suitable for single player usage. It can cause wounds, however.\n\nThe Hague Accords - The Hague Accords ban the use of expanding projectiles against the military forces of other nations. Some countries accept this as a blanket ban against the use of expanding projectiles against anyone, while the U.S. feels free to use JSP and HP against terrorists and criminals. (The U.S. didn''t sign the complete Hague Accords in any case, but still follows its guidelines in military conflicts.)\n\n12 gauge/70mm Shotgun ammo\n\nThe trick with the buckshot is that you can have a few large pellets or a bunch of smaller pellets. The smaller pellets have a better chance of scoring a hit due to the sheer number of pellets, but the severity of the wound won''t be as great as a hit from a larger pellet. The same principle applies to the armor piercing QB-8 (Quadrangle Buck) and flechettes. For purposes of game play, the armor piercing shot will not be as effective as standard buckshot against non-armored targets. (Of course, the standard buckshot is worthless against armored targets except for taking out the legs and arms, hoping for enough wounds to cause incapacitation.) They are listed from largest to smallest, separating the list into non-armor piercing and armor piercing types. The capacities are based on a 70mm length hull.\n\n000 Buck - 8 lead pellets (0.36")\n00 Buck - 9 lead pellets (0.33")\n0 Buck  - 12 lead pellets (0.32")\n1 Buck - 16 lead pellets (0.30")\n4 Buck - 27 lead pellets (0.24")\n\n\n\nQB 8 - 8 pellets (Armor Piercing) - Quadrangle Buck is made from a steel cylinder cut into two layers of four pie-shaped pieces per layer. The numerous sharp edges gives excellent penetration; however, the light weight and poor ballistic shape limits its effective range.\n\nFlechettes - 32 flechettes (Armor Piercing) - Flechettes are essentially small steel nails with tiny fins swaged into the rear.\n\nSlug - Slugs will pretty well flatten any target, armored or not; however, the issue of over penetration will determine whether you want to take the solid or the hollow-point slug.\n\nSlug HP - Hollow-point slugs. Less penetration than regular slugs.\n\nBaton - Rubber batons. Used for training.\n\n\nCalibers\n\n.30 US Carbine - In 1940, the US Army''s Ordnance Department approached Winchester with a light rifle concept. This was to bridge the difference between the .45 ACP and the .30-06. For the cartridge, Winchester recommended a rimless version of their .32 Winchester Self-Loading sized down for .308" projectiles. The resulting cartridge tossed a 110gr projectile at nearly 2000fps from a carbine-length barrel. While derided for lacking stopping power in contrast to the .30-06, the .30 Carbine is more powerful than many common handgun cartridges of similar size such as the .357 Magnum.\n\n.300 Whisper subsonic - Made by necking-up the .221 Remington Fireball case to .308" and using a 240gr Sierra MatchKing, this cartridge will fit and feed from 5.56x45mm NATO magazines. The Whisper is subsonic with about as much power and weight as .45 ACP, but in a thinner bullet which dramatically increases armor penetration. Good against all targets, but is\nunreliable against heavy armor.\n\n.300 Winchester Magnum - A long range sniping round, it is favored by US Navy SEALS and the German Bundeswehr. While not in the same class as the .338 Lapua, it has roughly the same power as 7mm Remington Magnum, and easily exceeds the performance of 7.62x51mm NATO. Good against all targets.\n\n.338 Lapua Magnum - Originally designed as a long range sniping cartridge to bridge the ballistic gap between the .300 Winchester Magnum and the .50 BMG. It is in service with GSG9, the British SAS, British Army, Royal Marines, and the Dutch military. An early prototype of the cartridge even saw service with the US Navy SEALs. Good against all targets.\n\n.338 Whisper subsonic - Made by necking-up the 7mm Remington BenchRest case to .338" and using a 300gr Sierra Match King, this cartridge will fit and feed from 7.62x51mm NATO magazines. Good against all targets, but is unreliable against heavy armor.\n\n.357 Magnum - Using a lengthened and strengthened version of the .38 Special case, the .357 Magnum was rapidly accepted by hunters and law enforcement. At the time of its introduction, it was claimed to easily pierce the body panels of automobiles and crack engine blocks. While it has less power than .44 Magnum, it compares favorably to the 10x25mm Norma and .45 ACP, but with better armor penetration. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.357 SIG - Designed to produce .357 Magnum revolver ballistics in a self-loading pistol (automatics), the .357 SIG is roughly a .40 S&W case necked down to .355". Despite the manufacturer''s claims, it is not quite as powerful as an actual .357 Magnum, but it exceeds the 9x19mm NATO and falls roughly in-between the .40 S&W and 10x25mm in power. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.376 Steyr - Roughly a shortened 9.3x64mm Brenneke case necked up for .375" projectiles. The cartridge is loaded to give performance approaching that of the .375 Holland & Holland. More power than required for two-legged predators, even those with armored hides. Good against all targets.\n\n.40 S&W - Roughly a shorter cased version of the 10x25mm Norma, this round is a step up in power from the 9x19mm NATO in similar sized handguns. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.40 S&W subsonic - Roughly a shorter cased version of the 10x25mm Norma, this round loses about 20% of it''s energy when subsonic. This round is a step up in power from the 9x19mm subsonic, and has beaten out the parent 10x25mm subsonic in popularity. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.44 Magnum - A high powered pistol cartridge designed primarily for hunting, the .44 Magnum offers less power than .50 AE and .454 Casull, but much more than .357 Magnum. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.440 CorBon Magnum - The .440 CorBon Magnum is derived by necking down a .50 Action Express case down to accept the same .429" projectiles used in .44 Magnum cartridges. The 240gr .429" projectile has equal sectional density to the 325gr .500" of the .50 AE. However, with equal powder charges, the .440 CorBon can launch the 240gr projectile much faster than the 325gr projectile from the .50 AE. This equals greater energy and penetration against hard and soft targets.\n\n\n\n\n.45 ACP +P - The standard U.S. pistol round for about a century, the .45 ACP offers more power than .40 S&W but less than a full-power 10x25mm Norma. The +P designation indicates that the cartridge is loaded to higher pressures and generates higher velocity than normal version of the round. Very effective against unarmored targets while reducing the specter of over-penetration.\n\n.45 ACP subsonic - The standard U.S. pistol round for about a century. Typical .45 ACP loads are already subsonic, making them ideal for suppressed weapons. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n.454 Casull - A very high powered pistol cartridge designed for taking the largest game animals, the .454 offers more power than .44 Magnum and has superior penetration over the .50 AE. It is the most powerful handgun cartridge in NATO 3. Good against armored targets.\n\n.45-70 Government - Adopted by the US Army in 1873 as their standard service rifle cartridge, the .45-70 Government refuses to fade away. Most commercial loadings of the cartridge are constrained by the possibility that someone may attempt to fire a modern loading in one of the 1873-vintage rifles. However, current production rifles from Marlin, Ruger, and Browning can accept pressures nearly twice as high as the original black powder specs. The low velocity of typical .45-70 loads does not lend itself to defeating soft body armor, but the high sectional density of the projectile can result in severe blunt force trauma.\n\n.50 Action Express (AE) - A very high powered pistol cartridge, exceeding the .44 Magnum, the cartridge''s combination of high velocity and mass results in very favorable penetration characteristics against hard cover and certain types of body armor. It is excellent in close quarters where the first shot is often the only one that counts.\n\n4.6x30mm H&K - H&K''s answer to the 5.7x28mm FN. Based on HK''s experimental 4.6x36mm cartridge for the HK36 ACR in the early ''70s, even retaining its unique Löffelspitz (spoon-nose) projectile. Like the FN entry, the 4.6x30mm has amazing armor penetration, yet recoils less than a 9x19mm pistol cartridge. The smaller HK projectile appears to gives superior penetration over the FN variant, but this also detracts from the permanent wound cavity. Best against unarmored targets, but can be used against armored.\n\n4.92x34mm H&K caseless - This revolutionary round encases the bullet in a combustible material. There is no brass holding the cartridge together and the "powder" is completely burned upon firing. The round itself is ballisticly similar to the 5.45x39mm Soviet but has better armor penetration. Good against all targets.\n\n\n\n\n5.45x18mm Soviet - Similiar to a necked down 6.35x16mm Browning (.25 ACP) and producing exterior ballistics equal to a .22 rimfire, 5.45x18mm cartridge possesses an impressive ability to defeat body armor. For best gameplay results, one should still restrict its use to unarmored targets only and use multiple shots.\n\n5.45x39mm Soviet - The Soviet''s response to the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge. While the long 5.45mm projectile doesn''t fragment like the 5.56x45mm NATO, it is more prone to reliably tumble/yaw. Good against all targets.\n\n5.56mm Steyr Flechette - Introduced for the US Army''s ACR trials, the Steyr cartridge uses a plastic case with a small caliber flechette pulled by a 5.56mm diameter sabot. The flechette is launched at a high velocity and the narrow projectile offers excellent penetration. However, this small diameter also reduces the terminal ballistics. Good against all targets but tends to wound more than kill.\n\n5.56x45mm NATO - Adopted by the US military in the 1960s, it later became the NATO standard rifle cartridge in the early ''80s, displacing the much more powerful 7.62x51mm. Good against all targets, but has trouble with heavy armor.\n\n5.7x28mm FN - The small high velocity cartridge used in FN''s new pistol and SMG appears much like a miniature rifle round. The 5.7mm FN cartridge has amazing armor penetration due to its small projectile size and speed, yet has much less recoil than many pistol rounds. However, don''t be tricked into believing that it is as powerful as a rifle cartridge. The ballistics are roughly pistol level with far superior penetration. Best against unarmored targets but can be used against armored.\n\n5.7x28mm FN subsonic - This round loses about 50% of its power due to the dramatic reduction in velocity. While the heavier projectile allows it to retain a portion of its armor penetration, its performance is severely hampered. Use against unarmored targets only and use multiple shots.\n\n7mm Remington Magnum - A long range hunting cartridge, the 7mm Remington Mag has its proponents among the US Secret Service (at least until recently) and those not emotionally tied to a .30" projectile. While less powerful than the.338 Lapua, it offers roughly the same power as .300 Winchester Magnum and far more power than the 7.62x51mm NATO. Good against all targets.\n\n7.62x39mm Soviet - The standard Soviet/ComBloc rifle cartridge from the mid-1940s to the mid-''70s, it is easily one of the most widely distributed cartridges in the world due to the distribution of the ubiquitous AK-47 series. Roughly equal in terminal performance with the 5.56x45mm NATO, it is far powerful less than 7.62x51mm NATO. Good against all targets.\n\n7.62x42mm Soviet - Outwardly similiar to the Nagant revolver cartridge, the 7.62x42mm Soviet''s case contains not only propellant and a projectile, but a piston sandwiched between the two. When the propellant is ignited, the expanding gas presses the piston forward to expel the projectile. However, the piston remains trapped inside the case, effectively sealing off the escape of propellant gas. The lack of expelled gas and a subsonic projectile results in no firing signature other than the mechanism of the parent weapon. The 7.62x42mm is credited with a maximum effective range of 50m, and the SP-4 armor-piercing cartridge can only defeat a helmet or body armor out to 25m. For best gameplay results, one should still restrict its use to unarmored targets only and use multiple shots.\n\n7.62x51mm NATO - This was the standard NATO rifle round until it''s gradual replacement by the 5.56x45mm. It is much more powerful than 5.56x45mm, but has considerable more recoil. It is now typically restricted to sniper rifles and GPMG. Good against all targets, but with lots of over penetration.\n\n7.62x51mm NATO Duplex - Originally designed to counter human-wave attacks, the M198 Duplex load fires two projectiles for one shot. Good against all targets.\n\n7.62x51mm NATO Match - A variation of the 7.62x51mm NATO, the cartridge uses a heavier projectile such as the 168gr or 175gr Sierra MatchKing. The production methods are tweaked to provide a high level of consistency and quality for the cartridges, which pays off in target group sizes. Good against all targets.\n\n7.62x51mm NATO Sabot - The sabot allows a .224" projectile to be fired from the larger 7.62x51mm case. This is designed to dramatically increase the short range velocity and penetration of the round. Good against all targets. Sabot is an archaic French word referring to a wooden shoe.\n\n7.62x54mmR Russian - The standard Russian rifle round from the 1890s to the mid-1940s, it is now confined to sniper rifles and GPMG. The "R" stands for rimmed. A little less powerful than 7.62x51mm NATO, but the target won''t quibble over the difference. Good against all targets.\n\n7.65x17mm Browning - A very small pistol round designed for...very small pistols. However, it was the predominant police service cartridge in Europe until the mid-1970s. It is the weakest of the cartridges in NATO 3 and Rogue Spear. Only useful against unarmored targets, and then only in volume.\n\n7.92x57mm Mauser - The standard German service rifle cartridge from 1888 to 1945, the 7.92x57mm (aka 8mm Mauser) has seen wide distribution around the globe through commercial, surplus, and military sales. Serbia continues to use it in sniper rifles and GPMG. It compares favorably to the 7.62x54mmR Russian and 7.62x51mm NATO. Good against all targets.\n9x19mm NATO - Invented for the German military at the turn of the century, the wide distribution of the 9x19mm Parabellum/Luger cartridge made it the logical choice for the NATO standard pistol and SMG round. While weaker than .40 S&W, it tends to have an advantage in weight and capacity. Fairly good against unarmored targets, but very weak against armor.\n\n9x19mm NATO subsonic - As suppressed 9x19mm weapons became more popular, purpose made subsonic cartridges were produced. In order to retain a portion of the energy for both weapon function and terminal ballstics, heavier the normal projectiles were substituted. The US Navy SEALs standardized on a 147gr loading due to its accuracy at 50 meters, allowing for reliable head shots from a suppressed MP5N. This round loses about 20% of it''s energy when subsonic. However, many US law enforcement agencies have followed the FBI''s advice and now use it as standard issue, even in unsuppressed weapons. The cartridge is weaker than .40 S&W subsonic and is roughly equal to the elderly .38 Special. Fairly good against unarmored targets, very weak against armor.\n\n9x21mm Russian - The 9x21mm Russian cartridge is roughly a lengthened version of the 9x18mm Makarov/PMM. Russian police have realized that the 9x18mm cartridges are barely adequate against criminals wearing body armor and driving sturdy Western European automobiles such as Mercedes-Benz. The armor-piercing RG-054 load is credited with defeating NIJ Threat Level IIIA armor out to 50m. While its muzzle energy is lower than the .40 S&W, it has an advantage in weight and capacity.\n\n9x23mm Winchester - Roughly a 9x19mm case lengthened by 4mm, the 9x23mm Winchester has its roots in IPSC competition shooting. John Ricco of CP Bullets had developed the ''9x23mm Super'' case as an alternative to the .38 Super ACP, whose cases varied dramaticly in strength. The .38 Super case also has the disadvantage of a vestigial semi-rim, which can interlock in magazines. Not to be confused with the externally similiar 9x23mm Bergmann-Bayard (aka 9mm Largo), Ricco''s case could be safely loaded to nearly double the chamber pressure of the older cartridges. Since Olin/Winchester produced the cases for Ricco, they saw the commercial potential for using the case in a loaded cartridge. Unfortunately, Olin/Winchester tried to cut Ricco out of his potential royalties from sale of the new 9x23mm Winchester. The resulting lawsuit (won by Ricco) and the poor marketing of 9x23mm pistols by Colt has led to tepid commercial acceptance. Despite these troubles, the 9x23mm Winchester comes closer to the goal of matching .357 Magnum ballistics than the more popular .357 SIG. Good against unarmored targets. \n\n9x30mm Grom - The 9x30mm Grom (Thunder) is roughly similar in dimensions and performance to the commercially unsuccessful 9mm Winchester Magnum. While its light projectile lacks sectional density, there is more than enough velocity to muscle through armor. It is compariable to the .357 Magnum and .30 US Carbine in similiar length barrels.\n9x39mm Soviet subsonic - The 9x39mm Soviet is roughly a 7.62x39mm Soviet case necked up for a heavy 9mm rifle projectile. There are competitive loadings from Nikolai Zabelin and Yuri Folov, each optimized for specific roles. It is compariable in performance to the .338 Whisper, but with slightly less penetration. Good against all targets; however, it can be unreliable against heavy armor.\n\n10x25mm Norma - Originally designed for the ill-fated Bren Ten pistol, the cartridge gained another lease on life when it was briefly promoted by the US FBI. Slightly more powerful than .45 ACP, the narrower projectile offers better penetration and greater effective range. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n10x25mm Norma subsonic - When the FBI''s Firearms Training Unit found that full-power 10x25mm loads were too powerful for the average user, the subsonic version was developed. This round loses about 40% of it''s power when subsonic. Slightly more powerful than .40 S&W subsonic, the 10x25mm subsonic was briefly the general issue sidearm cartridge of the FBI and continues in use in the FBI''s MP5/10 SMGs. Good against unarmored targets.\n\n12.7x99mm BMG (.50 BMG) - Originally designed to pierce tank armor in the First World War, the cartridge still serves an anti-materiel round against light armor. It is basically overkill against personnel. Use this for stopping vehicles.', ''),

I went directly to Tahir and he gave me the original price. My experience with him has been good but a few of my friends who intro''d me to him for some reason have fallen out with him.

(5876, ' I agree with Cap1, 25 yards is difficult, 10 or 15 is good till you consistently hit the bull and the ring outside it. \n\nBtw I noticed at the Karsaz range that some people were firing very quickly. Ideally when you begin what you do is have not more than 10 rounds in your pistol, first hold up the pistol to the target empty and sight in the bullseye and pull the trigger. Do this several times and you''ll notice if your hand is jerking or not at the pull of the trigger. Next chamber a bullet, and take your time to acquire the target, atleast 30 seconds before firing. After the round is fired look at the target closely to see where your bullet ended up, if it was off target think why, correct and then hold the pistol up again and fire. There should be atleast a 30 - 45 second delay between shots if you''re new. It is pointless to rapid fire your clip and it''s a waste of ammunition which is very expensive. Keep in your mind that the bullet you are firing is worth Rs. 40 to Rs. 50 each which is enough money to feed a person for a day. Make it count.\n\nAlso as a suggestion do not fire more than 50 rounds per session at the range. I once shot 10 boxes of 50 in 2 hours and it was more enjoyment rather than adding anything to my accuracy.', ''),

I have several 20-25 year old Shaheen cartridges and I''m almost 90 % sure they will fire as I tested several from the box and they worked fine. Messy though because at that time they used to make the shell from cardboard or something like that and it dries over time.\n\nFor sport all ammo is great, for SD/HD try to keep as fresh ammo as possible.\n\nBtw for people like me that like to buy most of their ammo in one go and use it over time.

(5922, ' A smooth bore barrel is one which has no grooves in it to make the shot inside the cartridge spin. It is totally smooth without any grooves at all. Most shotguns are smooth bore.\n\nA rifled barrel is one which has grooves in it like a pistol or rifle. These makes the shot/bullet spin as it leaves the barrel which makes the bullet more steady and increases it''s range.\n\nA rifled barrel with a sabot round (picture given below) achieves about three times the range of a normal shotgun. Average ''effective'' range for a normal shotgun is about 150 feet (50 yards), a sabot fired from a rifled barrel increases that to 450-500 feet (150 yards) giving it rifle like range and stability. \n\nCut and paste from an article:\n[i]\nA smooth-bore slug barrel does not spin its projectile, so its range is limited. A smoothbore barrel with a screw-in rifled choke is somewhat better because it will impart at least some stabilizing spin to a departing solid or sabot-design slug, and a full-length-rifled barrel is best (which is why high-power rifles are not smoothbore). In general terms, sabots are intended to be spun. The faster they spin, the better they work, the more stable the flight of the projectile they enclose and the more consistently they separate from the bullet. So, the rule of thumb is essentially this: All types of slug ammo, sabot and non-sabot, provide their best accuracy and the longest effective range when fired in a full-rifle barrel. A smoothbore barrel with rifled choke tube will be somewhat less accurate, and a pure smoothbore offers the least accuracy. You can safely shoot all types of slugs in all types of barrels, but if you use premium-grade sabot ammo in a smoothbore, you''re wasting your money, and will likely get less accuracy than with a conventional old Foster-type soft lead slug, since the sabot won''t properly separate from the bullet and it actually de-stabilizes the trajectory more than a solid-type load.[/i]\n\nSource: [url]http://www.gameandfishmag.com/hunting/whitetail-deer-hunting/gf_aa106402a/[/url]', ''),

In the middle of the table was a large pot of stew, which smelled delicious and made the holy man''s mouth water. \n\nThe people sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They appeared to be famished. \n\nThey were holding spoons with very long handles, that were strapped to their arms and each found it possible to reach into the pot of stew and take a spoonful. \n\nBut because the handle was longer than their arms, they could not get the spoons back into their mouths. \n\nThe holy man shuddered at the sight of their misery and suffering. \n\nGod said, ''You have seen Hell.'' \n\nThey went to the next room and opened the door. It was exactly the same as the first one. \n\nThere was the large round table with the large pot of stew which made the holy man''s mouth water. \n\nThe people were equiped with the same long-handled spoons, but here the people were well nourished and plump, laughing and talking. The holy man said, ''I don''t understand..'' \n\nIt is simple,'' said God . ''It requires but one skill. \n\nYou see they have learned to feed each other, while the greedy think only of themselves.''\n\nIts estimated 93% won''t forward or share this. \n\nSo, we are the 7% who share our experiences & learnings on this forum. \n\nI hope it conveys.', ''),

I was expecting a totally different grade of quality, these are proper well made pistols are a treat to hold. The disassembly is the simplest I''ve encountered and within 15 seconds of holding it for the first time I stripped it. Glocks have easy disassembly as well but it takes a little practice to be able to hold the slide back and push the latches on the sides down at the same time. This is much easier, just like the Beretta 92 only simpler. It weighs 860 g which is about the same as a Glock 17. It comes with two magazines, one of 15 and the other a 20 round extended magazine. The safety also has a firing pin block and decocker. \n\nAll in all I''m very impressed, ofcourse only testing at the range will tell how good this pistol really is.  \n\nBtw all of those who are looking for a pistol in the 35-40 K range, this is a serious contender and CF-98 feels like a cheap toy compared to this.', ''),

(6631, ' Most of bullets has small lead in them. Lead is a very hard metal and it keep the shape of bullet after firing thus giving more accurate shot.\n\nHowever, there are some controversies rising against the use of lead in bullets, especially when use in hunting. What happens that when a bullet kills an hunted animal, the lead is sprayed in a fine mist (1 and a half foot around the wound) over the animal and in it''s meat. You can''t find lead sharp particles in bite but it''s in there.\n\nLead is very dangerous for children and pregnant women. It''s can stun mental growth of children and is a major cause of lower IQ in children. That''s why governments all over the world banned lead in paint.\n\nLead is also dangerous for scavenger animals and birds who eat on hunted animal after remains are left by hunters. \n\nIn last few years, large ammunition manufacturers like Winchester and Remington (and many others) are moving towards "green" or lead-free bullets.\n\nYet there is no ban by governments on larger scale on lead bullets but it''s hunters'' choice whether they use normal lead bullets or lead-free bullets.\n\nOne more thing is cost. Lead bullets are cheaper while lead-free bullets (usually made with copper) are more expensive.\n\nFor more information:\n[url]http://californiahuntingtoday.com/hogblog/[/url]\n[url]http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/85/i48/8548notw7.html[/url]\n[url]http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammunition/etipwin_100907/[/url]\n[url]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/01/15/new-remington-lead-free-ammo-disintegrator-varmint-and-copper-solid/[/url]\n[url]http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/03/04/green.bullets/index.html[/url]\n[url]http://www.frangiblebullets.com/[/url]\n\n\nWhat do you guys think of it?

I would like to share my personal observations with my friends.\n\nSince most of the shooters on the forum are more interested in big bore shooting, I shall restrict myself to the events of the big bore pistol at national level competitions. \n\nThe last shooting National Shooting Championship I attended was held at Jhelum in Nov 08 and as usual there were two big bore pistol events.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. BIG BORE PROFESSIONALS\n\nWeapons: All calibers are allowed except .22 and .32 (pistols or revolvers both allowed). Normally 9mms are used but I have seen one or two shooters using .38 special revolvers.\n\nDistance:  25 meters\n\nGrip        :  single handed\nTime       :  1 minute/shot – total shots 20  (4 series of 5 shots each).\nResults (first 10 positions):\nGold       Navy guy         190/200\nSilver         “       “          189\nBronze   Punjab             182        (Turkey made 9mm NOT Stoeger)\n4th                “               178        (don’t know)\n5th                “               173        (Beretta 9mm target grade model)\n6th           Army              172        \n7th           Punjab           171        (SIG 9mm target grade model)\n8th           Navy              167\n9th           Punjab           167\n10th         Army              165\n\nNOTE: There was no representation from Sindh or NWFP. Baluchistan participated but performed poorly.\n\n2. BIG BORE AMATEURS\n\nAll conditions are the same except DOUBLE HANDED GRIP IS ALLOWED. Only one shooter from Sindh participated, whose score was 25/200.\n\nAll top positions were taken up by army, navy and PAF.\n\nAny shooter who has not shot at national level before is eligible to enter as an amateur for the first time only.\n\nResults:\n\nGold    Army    185/200\nSilver      “       183\nBronze   “        179\n\nI hope this information is of some help to set the sights at.\n\nIf you have any queries you are very welcome to shoot.\n\nSeeing the targets and enthusiasm of my friends from Karachi, I really would love to meet you at the next Nationals representing Sindh.\n\nI do tend to go with the suggested 1000 rounds estimate though I believe it to be on the lower side. After all you all shall inshaallah be pitting yourselves against guys with lot of experience and international exposure.

Shooting championship shall probably be held at karachi this year and it should be around Oct or Nov 09.\nParticipating in the event costs nothing, the expense is of ammo, travelling, hotels etc., and ofcourse the preperation phase.\nYou will have to contact Sindh Rifle Association in order to represent them.', ''),

Bulls are posted over there. \n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=445[/url]\n\nAs for my opinion of this pistol ? Well it''s a nice pistol and for it''s price a bargain (40K). The build quality is solid, firing it is very comfortable and a pleasure. But it does take some rounds to get used to it to become fairly accurate, I would say around 300 at least.  \n\nThere is a world of difference between this and the CF-98 which seems to be everyone''s bread and butter pistol. This fires better, looks better, is finished *much* better, has a better min round life (25k vs 8k for the CF98) and comes with a 20 round extended mag ! It is also very easy to clean, infact it the easiest pistol to take apart for cleaning I''ve ever used. Beretta 92/99 like slide disassembly only simpler. \n\nSome people were saying that the Kanuni has FTF & FTE issues. It is absoultly untrue, there are no such problems what so ever. To really test it I fired about 110 rounds of WAH from it and when it got nice and black from inside I put in the 20 round mag and rapid fired, fired great. I tried to take a picture of the inside of the barrel to show everyone that it still fired fine even after being so messy but it didn''t turn out so great. Have a look yourself.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Kanuni.jpg[/img]\n\n\nIf I had to rate three pistols in the 40 K range (+ - 5k) I would pick:\n\n1). NZ 85B \n2). Kanuni S\n3). NP 34\n\nSell your CF''s while they''re HOT !!  ;) And get one of the above you won''t regret your decision.', ''),

(6830, ' [b]PAF to start serial production of JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft soon [/b]\nWith singing of an agreement between Pakistan Air Force and Chinese firm CATIC the serial production of JF-17 (Thunder) aircraft would start soon. The agreement between PAF and CATIC on the basis of “seller’s credit” was reached at a ceremony held here Saturday, whereby 42 fighter jets would be jointly produced for the use of PAF.\n\nThe agreement was signed on behalf of PAF by Chairman Pakistan Aeronautical Complex Air Marshal Khalid Chaudary and President CATIC MA Zhiping which was witnessed by Chief of the Air Staff PAF Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed and Ambassador of China to Pakistan Luo Zhaohui besides other senior officials from both the parties. Under the agreement the lot of 42 aircraft would be co-manufactured by China and Pakistan and later these would be inducted in the PAF’s fleet. By 2015 PAF will get 250 JF-17s at cost of 3000 millions. Though Pakistan is facing a financial crunch, the serial production of the aircraft is being started with the cooperation of the Chinese government, Mahmood said. Pakistan has invested USD 600 million in the JF-17 project.\n\nTalking to media, Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mehmood Ahmed congratulated the peoples and governments of Pakistan and China on conduction of successful tests and trails of the most modern aircraft of its class and signing of agreement for start of their serial production. He said “despite all odds we have been successful to reach the stage of starting serial production of the aircraft.” “In the beginning we will produce 15 aircraft annually and their number will increase to 30 in a year this programme will be carried out in phases,” he said. He said that PAF will get 40 JF-17 thunders this year.\n\nHe said first squadron of these highest quality fighter jets would be inducted in the PAF’s fleet by mid of this year as PAF has already been using 8 jointly produced aircraft for the last couple of years. This fleet would be raised in Peshawar, he added.\n\nAbout the delivery of AWACS system to Pakistan, he said that agreement had already been reached with a Chinese firm which would start its delivery by 2010. On the delivery of first AWACS system Pakistan would pay 10 % cost of the aircraft while the rest would be paid on easy installments basis, he said.\n\nAnswering a question, he said the agreement between Pakistan and China for the delivery of High-Tech aircraft J?10 was intact and these aircraft after improving them further would be delivered to PAF in 2014-15.\n[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SbLMq5lGnKI/AAAAAAAAAlg/03Y4ick6qpc/s400/Picture+Courtesy+M+Usman+peshawar_jf17sqn.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SbLMqtAfQPI/AAAAAAAAAlY/iXlM9mT6wKA/s400/2f9480d4031da9c4a7a6a296ef70e7c9.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SbLMqeav3PI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/Eq0kU9zIlGc/s400/1912aad6e3657d6746c14d0b10b6881c.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/SbLMp1_xF1I/AAAAAAAAAlI/TFHFzizORuY/s400/40ae6435c179e883efce84f238533aba.jpg[/img]\nlink\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/03/paf-to-start-serial-production-of-jf-17.html[/url]', ''),

(6869, ' [b]Pakistan''s Growing Defense Industry[/b]\n\nU.S. Army Gen. William Westmoreland is reported to have said: "On the battlefield of the future, enemy forces will be located, tracked and targeted almost instantaneously through the use of data links, computer-assisted intelligence and automated fire control. … I am confident the American people expect this country to take full advantage of its technology–to welcome and applaud the developments that will replace wherever possible the man with the machine." It seems that this vision from the 1970s is being realized today. One manifestation of it is the development and deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles by many nations, including Pakistan.\n\nThe growing reliance on armed drones (aka predators) by Americans in Afghanistan and Pakistan''s FATA region to target militants has been making headlines with increasing casualties. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or Drones designed and manufactured in Pakistan have also been making news since IDEAS 2008 event in Karachi, Pakistan held in November of last year. Integrated Dynamics, a privately held Pakistani company that drew attention at IDEAS 2008 expo, is a developer and manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nIntegrated Dynamics is a full-service UAV systems provider based in Karachi, Pakistan. The company has been in business since 1997 and designs and integrates UAV systems primarily for the Government of Pakistan, the Pakistan armed forces and export. The company says they are committed to the use of the UAV system as a scientific and defensive tool that can be used to save lives and monitor potentially hostile environments for human personnel. The company also makes drones such as the turbojet-powered Tornado decoy, which can fly up to 200 kilometers, and emit false radar signals to "confuse enemy air defenses into thinking they are attacking aircraft," according to Defense News of Pakistan.\n\nIn addition to supplying drones to Pakistani military, the company exports its products to Australia, Spain, South Korea and Libya and the United States. The US homeland security department uses its Border Eagle surveillance drone for border patrol duties. Integrated Dynamics'' products cost only a fraction of the cost of comparable products made in the United States and Europe. ID UAV prices start from about $ 20,000 while comparable UAV products made in the West start from about $ 200,000, according to the Karachi-based company. The ID models have operational range of 20 to 1600 kilometers.\n\nIntegrated Dynamics began developing the Firefly mini-rocket UAV in late 2004 in response to Pakistani army operational requirements for a high-speed, short-range observation system that could be used in the high-altitude environments of northern Pakistan. A basic system costs around $3,000 and comprises four rockets, a launcher, a carry case, datalink and a PDA-based ground control station.The UAV company is an example of a new generation of private defense companies in Pakistan that have grown with the emerging needs of Pakistani military and export opportunities to both military and civilian sectors abroad.\n\n\n[b]Arms as Pakistan''s Cottage Industry[/b]\n\nPakistan has a long history of arms manufacturing as a cottage industry. The dusty little town of Darra Adam Khel,only a half-hour drive from Peshawar, reminds visitors of America''s Wild West. The craftsmen of this town are manufacturers and suppliers of small arms to the tribal residents of the nation''s Federally Administered Tribal Areas who carry weapons as part of their ancient culture. The skilled craftsmen of FATA make revolvers, automatic pistols, shotguns and AK-47 rifles. Until five years ago, the list also had items such as anti-personnel mines, sub-machine guns, small cannons and even rocket launchers. Pakistani government has forced the tribesmen to stop making heavy assault weapons to try and prevent the Taliban and Al Qaeda from getting access to such weapons.\n\nPakistan''s arms industry has come a long way from making small arms as a cottage industry in the last few decades. The US and Western arms embargoes imposed on Pakistan at critical moments in its history have proved to be a blessing in disguise. In particular, the problems Pakistan faced in the aftermath of Pressler Amendment in 1992 became an opportunity for the country to rely on indigenous development and production of defense equipment.\n\n[b]Pakistan''s Military Industrial Complex[/b]\n\nThe country now boasts a powerful industrial, technological and research base developing and manufacturing for its armed forces and exporting a wide variety of small and large weapons ranging from modern fighter jets, battle tanks, armored vehicles, frigates and submarines to unmanned aerial vehicles and high tech firearms and personal grenade launchers for urban combat. Some of these items were on display at IDEAS 2008, the 5-day biennial arms show held November last year in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nPakistan has become an increasingly important player in the world arms industry, a global industry and business which manufactures and sells weapons and military technology and equipment. Arms production companies, also referred to as Defense Contractors, produce arms mainly for the armed forces of nation states. Products include guns, ammunition, missiles, military aircraft, military vehicles, ships, electronic Systems, and more. The arms industry also conducts significant research and development. Pakistan''s major defense manufacturing companies are owned and operated by Pakistan''s military. According to Business Monitor, Pakistan''s defense industry contains over 20 major public sector units (PSUs) and over 100 private-sector firms. The majority of major weapons systems production and assembly is undertaken by the state-owned PSUs, while the private-sector supplies parts, components, bladed weapons and field equipment. Major PSUs include the Pakistan Ordnance Factory (POF), Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT), Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works (KSEW) and the Pakistan Machine Tool Factory. Multinational presence in Pakistan is limited, although joint production or engineering support in the development of certain armaments has recently occurred with companies such as DCN International and the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.\n\nIDEAS 2000, Pakistan''s first major arms show, was organized after former President Musharraf assumed leadership of the country in the wake of the 1999 bloodless coup that toppled the Nawaz Sharif government. At the show, the former president emphasized the need to grow Pakistan''s defense industry and private sector involvement in R&D;, manufacturing and marketing of arms. Held every two years since the year 2000, the show has become a runaway success. It has helped Pakistan and other friendly nations to show off their wares, find customers, share knowledge, build bilateral partnerships, encourage scientific innovation and learning among young people and made visitors and Pakistani citizens more aware of the role defense industry plays in national defense and economy. Held in November last year, International Defense Exhibition and Seminar 2008 attracted 256 companies including 162 foreign and 94 Pakistani companies. Among the largest foreign pavilions, Turkey had 28 companies and United States had 22. Other major exhibitors came from China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, the Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Among other products, Pakistani companies showed off JF-17 fighter plane built by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex in partnership with China''s Chengdu Aircraft, Al-Khalid main battle tank, POF eye capable of shooting around corners and launching grenades in urban combat, and a variety of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) designed, developed and built in Pakistan.\n\n[b]World Arms Market[/b]\n\nIt is estimated that yearly, over 1 trillion dollars are spent on military expenditures worldwide (2% of World GDP). Part of this goes to the procurement of military hardware and services from the military industry. The combined arms sales of the top 100 largest arms producing companies amounted to an estimated $315 billion in 2006. In 2004 over $30 billion were spent in the international arms trade (excluding domestic arms sales). Many industrialized countries have a domestic arms industry to supply their own military forces. Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens. The illegal trade in small arms is prevalent in many countries and regions affected by political instability.\n\n[b]Pakistan''s Arms Business[/b]\n\nIn a July 2008 interview with Pakistan''s Dawn newspaper, Major General Mohammad Farooq, Director General of the Defense Export Promotion Organization, indicated that collaboration with the United States had increased in manufacturing armored personnel carriers "with transfer of technology". There have been unconfirmed reports that Pakistan is manufacturing Humvees for the US military in Afghanistan. General Farooq also claimed that Pakistan''s defense exports have tripled to around $300 million because of the quality of its ammunition, anti-tank guided missiles, rocket launchers and shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. He said exports to South Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries had increased significantly. It has been reported that Sri Lanka has purchased cluster bombs, deep penetration bombs and rockets and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) from Pakistan.\nGeneral Farooq said optical instruments like night vision devices, laser range-finders and designators, laser threat sensors, artillery armor mortars and munition, mine detectors, anti-tank rifles, missile boats, different types of tear gases, fuses of unarmed vehicles, security equipment and sporting and hunting guns were also being manufactured in Pakistan. "The fuses are being purchased by countries like Italy, France and Spain," he said.\n\nIn reply to a question, he said Pakistan''s military exports were higher than India''s. "Indians started working on Arjun tank but, they are yet to induct it in their army, while Pakistan has built and handed over Al Khalid tank to the army, although it started the program later," he said.\n\nLately, Pakistan has come under severe criticism by human rights groups for being a leading manufacturer and exporter of land-mines, cluster bombs and depleted uranium munitions.\n\n[b]High-Tech Aerial Warfare[/b]\n\nThe three main branches of Pakistani military are evaluating UAVs made in Pakistan and the rest of the world for purchase and deployment. Pakistan has been eager to boost its capabilities for high-tech aerial warfare and restructure and reorient its military to respond to the new and emerging challenges of combating insurgents. A number of public and private sector companies have been engaged in research, development and manufacturing of unmanned aerial vehicles as a part of this initiative. The public sector companies include Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Air Weapons Complex and National Development Complex.\nHere''s a brief run-down of the status of Pakistan''s three military services as gleaned from Jane''s and other publications:\n\n[b]Pakistan Air Force[/b]\n\nAs part of its effort to go high-tech, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) will formally induct unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into service for the first time in 2009, the chief of the PAF has told Jane''s. In addition to the Bravo+ UAV, which, according to PAF Chief Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed, has been built indigenously by Air Weapons Complex, the PAF will also receive the Falco UAVs produced by Selex Galileo of Italy. The two systems will be used mainly for aerial reconnaissance and information gathering, although the PAF will later also induct UAVs equipped with weapon systems to carry out offensive operations. "This capability we are developing fairly rapidly; we are becoming mature. It is part of our operations now and I look forward to seeing this in real operations by [the] beginning [of] 2009," ACM Ahmed reportedly told Jane''s.\n\n[b]Pakistan Army[/b]\n\nThe Uqaab, Pakistan Army''s drone designed and built by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, is the first step towards the eventual mass production of a Pakistani UAV. Technical details shared by Pakistani officials suggest that the Uqaab can fly at an altitude of about 15,000 ft and is equipped with day- and night-vision equipment. There have been unconfirmed reports that Pakistan has discussed with China the possibility of further developing the Uqaab to carry a weapons payload, according to Jane''s.\n[b]\nPakistan Navy[/b]\n\nPakistan Navy is reportedly interested in deploying vertical takeoff and landing UAVs on its ship. As a part of its plans to purchase and deploy UAVs, the Pakistani navy has completed trials of Austrian Schiebel Camcopter S-100 and Swedish made Cybaero autonomous VTOL UAVs from a Pakistani frigate in the Arabian sea in April 2008.\n\n[b]Pakistan''s UAV Industry[/b]\n\nGrowing interest by Pakistani military and foreign companies and governments has helped spawn several private Pakistani UAV companies specializing in air-frames, launch and propulsion, flight control, tele-command and control systems, signal intelligence, training simulators, etc. Some of the private companies involved in UAV development and manufacturing include Integrated Dynamics, East-West Infinity, Satuma and Global Industrial Defense Solutions. Between the public and private sector UAVs developed in Pakistan, there is a long list of products including Bravo and Uqaab by Air Weapons Complex, Heliquad by East-West Infinity, Nishan Mk1 , Vision MK1 , Vision MK2 , Nishan TJ 1000, Tornado, Border Eagle, Hornet, Hawk, Hawk Mk1, Shadow and Vector by Integrated Dynamics Pakistan, Flamingo, Jasoos and Mukhbar by Satuma Pakistan , Bazz and Ababeel by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. These products vary in payload type, size and weight, engine types, range, flying altitude, endurance and launch and recovery systems. Growing domestic and international demand and increasing competition among suppliers is expected to produce significant improvements in capabilities and quality of the UAV products offered by Pakistani companies. In addition to Integrated Dynamics described above, here are three more UAV companies in Pakistan:\n\n[b]East-West Infinity:[/b]\n\nOne of the companies at the forefront of UAV development is East West Infinity (EWI). EWI''s latest products are the Heliquad micro tactical UAV and the Whisper Watch signals intelligence (SIGINT) package.\nThe Heliquad was first displayed in prototype form at the IDEAS2006 defense exhibition. Equipped with a tiny camera, it can relay pictures back to troops or special forces in an urban environment or in the field, giving them a tactical reconnaissance capability. Being exceptionally small and powered by four electric motors, Heliquad is highly stealthy and represents the cutting edge of EWI''s electronics miniaturization. SIGINT has become more important with ongoing anti-terrorism operations on the western front and in the tribal areas. Designed for militaries unable to afford high-end, dedicated SIGINT platforms, the company says its Whisper Watch platform is most effective when aerostat-mounted, as the platform is stationary and airborne for longer.\n\n[b]Satuma[/b]\n\nSatuma (Surveillance and Target Unmanned Aircraft), founded in 1989, is small UAV specialist company based near Islamabad, Pakistan. Satuma products include Flamingo, Jasoos and Mukhbar UAVs. Its biggest customer is Pakistan''s military.\n\n[b]Global Industrial Defense Solutions:[/b]\nGIDS, the largest of the private defense sector companies, has a UAV division, which produces a whole range of operational and training UAVs.Its biggest customer in Pakistan''s military. The UAVs developed by GIDS have been extensively flight tested by military. GIDS ground control stations have an interactive and user friendly interface, where flight parameters and auto-pilot mission planning, and execution is done in addition to reception of high-enbd crisp quality video transmitted over an encrypted digital link.\nHeaded by a retired PAF Air Vice Marshall, GIDS has emerged from a combination of 7 Pakistani private defense companies that include AERO (Advanced Engineering Research Organization), IDS (Integrated Defense Systems), MSL (Maritime Systems Pvt Limited), ACES (Advanced Computing and Engineering Solutions), IICS (Institute of Industrial Control Systems), ATCOP (AI-Technique Corporation) and SETS (Scientific Engineering and Technology Solutions). Other than UAVs, its major products include anti-personnnel, anti-armor, incendiary, anti-runway, electronic impact and time-based fuses, electronic warfare equipment, navigation systems, optical fiber and optical fiber cables. Anti-tank Wire Guided Missile System known as "Baktar Shiken" made by IICS, a component of GIDS.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nPakistan''s growing defense industry is going high tech to keep up with the challenges of a changing world that requires advanced weapons and new strategies to maintain peace and stability in a hostile neighborhood. At the same time, Pakistan''s defense industry is contributing to scientific, technological, industrial and economic development of the nation by training and employing thousands of citizens. The investments made in defense production are a good bargain for the companies, their investors and the taxpayers of Pakistan to help ensure the nation''s economic, political and national security against both internal and external threats.\n\n[url]http://www.zimbio.com/South+Asia+Investor+Review/articles/75/Pakistan+Growing+Defense+Industry[/url]', ''),

C919 comes after Airbus and Boeing, so you will have ABC in the aviation industry," said Wu, apolitical advisor who is here attending the annual session of 11thNational Committee of the Chinese People''s Political Consultative Conference.\n\nThe first 9 in the name implies forever in Chinese culture, while 19 means the first jumbo jet produced by China will have 190seats, he said.\n\nWu said that his company will choose suppliers of engines, airborne equipment, and materials through international bidding, and will encourage foreign suppliers to enter into partnership with Chinese manufacturers.\n\n"We will choose foreign-manufactured products like engines at the beginning phase, but we will also independently do the research and manufacturing work at the same time," noted Wu.\n\nThe Shanghai-based COMAC was set up in May, 2008 after approval in early 2007 by the State Council, China''s Cabinet. It has a registered capital of 19 billion yuan (2.78 billion U.S. dollars), with the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission as the biggest shareholder.\n\nWu said the jumbo jet project now involves 47 institutions from China and abroad, and that the preliminary general technical design plan and commercial feasibility study have been completed.\nlink\n[url]http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/06/content_10959526.htm[/url]\n\n[img]http://www.people.cq.cn/upfile/20090307183241-1.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.people.cq.cn/upfile/20090307183241-0.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.people.cq.cn/upfile/20090307183241-2.jpg[/img]\n\n190 seats is, at best, qualified as a full size regional jet.\nit''s Same size of a Boeing 737 economically that make sense,\nsince that is best seller.\nChinese C919 is cheaper no doubt,\nI hope it will be more advance than Boeing 737 which were developed in 60''s (first flight 1967)!\nbut 8 years to develop a jumbo jet is very short, even considering using imported part such as engine.', ''),

I think its very much clear about a few possible scenarios regarding weapon-license relationship. \n\nFor general help, there are a few scenarios that might be useful for forum members & visitors. These can be good questions to ask arms dealers as our members frequently visit them:\n\n1. At the time of issue, a license was marked as NPB Rifle and a 7mm rifle posted on it a few years back. \n    If ONLY .22 is NPB in rifle category,\n    a. Is it a NPB or PB by nature as per current policy?\n    b. Once the existing 7mm rifle is taken off, another 7mm can be purchased on it or will it be a .22 rifle?\n    \n2. If ALL bolt-action rifles are NPB now, what about the licenses issued mentioning .22 Rifle on them?\n    a. Can another bore bolt-action rifle be bought on it without making any changes?\n\n3. What is the process of transferring a father''s licenses PB & NPB (not just the weapon) in own name? In both scenarios of father being alive or deceased.\n\n4. A PB license by origin or weapon specific is what is generally known. Are there any other ones like open PB licenses without specifying bore or weapon?\n\n5. An NPB license by origin or even weapon specific under the governing policy of that time sometimes becomes PB due to policy change. Should it be considered a PB and the restrictions implied accordingly?\n\nThere are some more questions, but let me not confuse readers for now.', ''),

These included murders, attempted murders, robberies, edacities and aerial firing.\n\nMost of the cases occurred in contravention of 13 Arms Ordinance meaning that shots were fired from unlicensed weapons. Most of the firearm cases took place in Bannu, Tank and North and South Waziristan.\n\nPeople in the province have an estimated 1 million Kalashnikovs and Kalakovs and only five per cent of them are licensed. These licences were issued on political basis during the tenure of late prime minister Mohammad Khan Jonejo.\n\nThe government had some 10 years ago launched a drive to cleanse the country of automatic weapons, but that didn’t bear the desired results and the menace continued unabated.\n\nA Kalashnikov or AK-47, which had been sold at Rs65,000 in 1976, is now easily available at Rs5,000. “There is no misfire and magazines with the capacity of 75 cartridges can be sued in it,” said a weapon expert.\n\nMarkets in Darra Adamkhel, Khyber, Mohmand, North and South Waziristan and Bajaur agencies are replete with automatic weapons made of Russia, Hungary, China, Egypt, Bulgaria, Finland, Iraq, North Korea and Germany.\n\nSources said the people could get weapons in any part of the country after making an advance payment to the dealers in Fata.\n\n“Though the WAH factory manufactures weapons for armed forces, police and law-enforcement personnel, parts of G-3 automatic guns smuggled from the factory are assembled in the Darra Adamkhel market,” said forensic experts.\n\nThey said that it was hard to determine the entry and exit points of bullets in firearm victims because of multiple and, some time, countless shots. They said that the number of contact injuries had also registered a surge because bullets injured untargeted persons after piercing through the targeted ones.\n\nPolice said that Abbottabad, Mansehra, Battagram and Kohistan were a few districts where people still used 12, 16 and 20 bore guns.\n\nThese types are used for hunting purposes in other parts of the NWFP and Fata.The unlimited trade of illegal weapons has assumed alarming proportion. The sources said the latest additions to this trade are US weapons which were seized from American forces during ambushes in Afghanistan.\n\nThey said that police often seized huge quantity of illegal weapons. The seized weapons, they said, were replaced with dummy weapons before being shifted to the weapon storage of the police department.\n\nSource:[url]http://www.dawn.com/2007/09/08/nat21.htm[/url]', '');

(7020, ' @ tareen:\n\ntareen maybe the other forum members will guide you differently but my immediate family (myself, dad, and grand father) have had various licenses from 1956 onwards to last about 2006 and so here goes. THese license have either been free of fees army licenses with dad or dada''s ranks on them or of the regular civilian type:(pls bear in mind that this is on personal experience also)\n\n1. a) under current definition the .22 condition is only applicable for semi-auto rifles. Any bolt action rifle calibre incldg .308 (G3 ammo), 7 mm, .222 etc can be entered on the license and maintained.\n    b) if the exisiting rifle is taken off you can enter any bolt action rifle on it. if you do it immediately no issue but if you keep the license free of weapon you will need a stamp of ''purchase validity extension'' for either 6 mths or 1 mth from either the DCO office or Home Deptt.\n\n2. again the .22 condition is for semi auto rifles and not applicable to bolt actions.\n\n3. you cannot get the arms license for your father (or father in law) transferred in your name if the parents are alive. if the parent has passed away the weapon has to be deposited with the home office pending arms license transfer. the same can be done by using the form that is attached on the pakguns website under forms. there is a section related to transfer of license and weapon. for a prohibited bore it might not be passed but for a npb there is usually no issue. in either case you will need a death certificate and a noc from other heirs nominating you as the rightful heir. ( i advise that in the case parents are alive just enter yourself as a retainer on the license and use that. i have as a retainer even transported my grand parent''s weapons on domestic flights and till recently. another frined of mine who''s father was tragically killed a few years back applied to transfer his fahther''s old licenses to his name. he was successful but got screwed over as new books were issued and he lost the right to non .22 semi autos on the rifle licenses. 12 bores and pistols were not effected. PB license was cancelled) \n\n4. yes there are open PB licenses as the same has depended on issuing authority or even the clerk writing the license out. generally for local use the PB is for the 7.62 calibre used in ak''s. (my dad''s m-16 that he had bought back from a navy seals course in phillipines was under a 223 license and never subjected to a PB license) so just depends. also PB would be for fully auto weapons and hence limited choices. guess sometimes it would depend on luck. again if you''re looking for a ak (or kk) u shouldn be worried as that would be covered under the PB.\n\n5. the last would happen when the licenses issued in a certain period are cancelled. so yes theoretically changing the policy would chnage the status of the license and conditions but difficult to implement. tricky one and i haven had an experience for this scenario.', ''),

(7026, ' Chiness aviation industry is growing dramatically .I am not comparing any aircraft with any one. Just giving an idea where the china aviation industry stands now they are now producing all type of aircrafts from transport to fighter jet just look chines su-27(j-11), J-10 they are comparable aircraft with f-15 and Lockheed f-16.and don''t forget chiness JXX project fifth generation fighter aircraft comparable or may be superior to F-22.\nCHINA industry lacks only in engine and avionics they are catching these things very fast just give china another 10 years they will produce the aircraft on the par of European technology.\n\nI keep trying to drill this point to everyone: China''s RATE of progression will only increase for the next 20 years even if the RATE of growth stays the same. To see why this is so just consider a weightlifter who lifts 100% more each time. Even though the rate of growth stays the same as he lifts 10 kilogrammes and then 20, the next lift will give him 40 kilos, thus being 4 times as much as the original amount. His next lift will be 8 times as much as the original. Similarly, as China''s GDP has grown four times its original value since the year 2000, advances should correspondingly come four times as fast in some areas which previously were not growing. The development of J-XX, helicopter engines and this new jumbo jet are such examples. Britain from 1800 to 1850, Japan and Germany from 1860 to 1910, and America from 1900 to 1960 went through the same thing. China will be no different.', ''),

(7269, ' Here r few informations regarding them,\nThe Bore Snake is definitely the world''s fastest bore cleaner. Crafted with a series of built-in brushes, it combines all the cleaning processes into one simple step, effectively cleaning your bore in a single pass. First, an initial floss area brushes the action then removes loose grit and debris in the bore prior to the main scrubbing. Finally, the main floss, with 160 times more floss than a standard cleaning patch, super-scrubs the bore to a mirror-like finish. Brass-weighted drop-through cord slips easily down the barrel, simply grasp and pull cord through the barrel - one pull through does it all. Lightweight and compact, it''s easy to take to even the most remote hunting destination. There''s no exposed metal to damage the rifling or crown, and no assembly is required. And it is solvent safe, washable and reusable hundreds of times. Available for rifles, shotguns and pistols.', ''),

(7405, ' Armour Piercing Bullets pierce armour through a thermochemical reaction. The core of these bullets is generally made up of magnesium based alloys. Upon strike, the metal (i.e. the target) in front of the bullet melts under high temperature. Armour Piercing Shells employ a similar, though much advanced, technique.\n\nObviously a steel core bullet can not achieve a similar result. Either it deflects right from the surface or is destroyed completely without causing much damage to the armour. However, these might have some effect against a common Bullet Proof Vest.\n\nAgainst soft targets, steel core bullets do not have much advantage either. Off course a bullet that disintegrates/expands/tumbles is much more lethal in such targets.\n\nBy the way, APBs are hard on the muzzle. They have a slightly larger diameter to give them more velocity and temperature. You should not use them for common target practice.', ''),

(7628, ' Shahreyar, since you did the rest of the process yourslef you should have peace of mind that all is in order-chill out about it.\n\nSecond, from the license number it cannot be distinguished which qouta the license came from. The License Number is issued from a ledger entry in the DC Registers and works serial wise. There is no such thing as a political qouta. The only qota is the the number of license a DCO, Home Minister & Home Secy can issue in a month. So as such there is no way of distinguishing if the license is under any qouta-normal or political. That is why the licenses taht have been at one tinme or another cancelled have been for an entire time period so as to reduce number of license issued under one political regime.\n\nYou need to register your license with the Police Station under the jurisdiction your home address falls. (I am assuming that the address on the license and your NIC is the same). Best that you get it registered in the PS that your permanent address is. Its not the physical proximity to the PS that matters. In KHI esp you can have a PS next to your house but your house isn under its jurisdiction. For example: The closest PS to my house was the Clifton one but i had to get the license registered in Darakshan as the address on my license and NIC was for my parents adrress in Defence', ''),

Its Glock supply in the market that is driving the prices down.', ''),

However to be on the safer side take the new weapon to the police station and explain that you have replaced it on your exisitig license that is already registered with them. They dont varify anything unless a crime is comitted or there is a report against you alleging that your license is fake.

Hence, Glock (for instance) has a compact, and crisp muzzle blast, while TT has a crack to it.  \nB: Muzzle velocity for TT is very high, in fact higher than 9 X 19mm for equal barrel lengths. \nC: The higher amount of residue burning outside/near the barrel end.\n\nAll these factors make the gun louder.

The PAF has achieved such a deterrence level that no one can cast an evil eye on the motherland, he said. Air Chief?designate Air Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman (Deputy Chief of Air Staff perations), who will take over the PAF’s command on Wednesday was also present with the Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed on the accession.\n\n\nAir Marshal Rao is architect of an effective strategy to deal with the Indian threat of carrying out surgical strikes against Pakistan. Due to this strategy the adversary had to shelve its nefarious plan of surgical operations. Air Chief Marshal Tanvir Mehmmod Ahmed said that the country achieved nuclear power back in 1998 with the aim that the defence of the country be made impregnable and over the years PAF has been able to successfully achieve the target. “We fought two wars with India in 1965 and 1971 and prevented three imminent wars in 1998, 2002 and in recent days in the aftermath of Mumbai attacks.” India had threatened Pakistan of undertaking surgical strikes against her but seeing the level of preparedness and alertness of PAF the looming dangers from the adversary were averted effectively, which showed that the attainment of nuclear power has helped in achieving peace in the region.\n\n\n“It helped deter any misadventure in the region.” he said. Answering a question, he said 95 % of PAF personnel and officers are not out to earn livelihood but they joined PAF with the passion to defend the motherland through obtaining mastery over the machine and ammo. Talking about the last ten years, the Air Chief said the PAF today is much more effective and potent force than what it was in 1998 and it shall continue to excel further with the passage of time. Earlier, making remarks at the book launching, the Air Chief termed all the sanctions imposed by the west from time to time in the past a s blessing in disguise saying “this helped us a lot to achieve indiginization of technology. It has brought us at the higher pedestal.” “We would have not gone nuclear. We are now a nuclear state and it is all due to the sanctions,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe co?production with China of a modern fighter aircraft like JF?17 Thunder is also an outcome of the sanctions. “We achieved all that with minimal spending while living within our limited financial resources.” About the book he said the author Alan Warne (Editor of UK based Air Forces Monthly) has written the book on his own as the PAF had facilitated the writer to carry out his work with an unbiased approach independently. He appreciated the efforts of the writer for creating a masterpiece within a short span of about 15 months. He said the book covers past, present and future of the PAF, presenting salute to heros of the force besides shedding light on future plans. He also appreciated the services of former Director Public Relations (Air) Air Commodore Sarfraz Ahmed Khan for facilitating the author for accomplishment of his task.\n\n\nHe also mentioned the DPR (Air) Air Commodore Humayun and his able team in the Directorate. Earlier, the author of the book said that the PAF during the last 40 years had been undergoing sanctions and despite all that what it has achieved is highly appreciable. PAF is the only air force of the world which has been co?building modern fighter aircraft like JF?17 Thunder, he said. Chairman International Relations Department of Quaid?e?Azam University Islamabad Prof. Dr. Ishtiaq Ahmed and Assistant Professor of Strategic Studies Quaid?e?Azam University also spoke about the book. A large number of senior officers of PAF attended the function.', ''),

Both the out-going and in-coming Chiefs of the Air Staff were presented guards of honor separately to formally mark the change of command.\n\nEarlier, Air Chief Marshal Tanvir pinned badges on the shoulders of Air Marshal Rao, formally promoting him to the rank of Air Chief Marshal.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Tanvir while delivering farewell address termed the occasion a happy augury that he was handing over the command of the world’s one of the best air forces to a worthy officer of PAF.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the PAF would continue to flourish in the days to come as a number of contracts for acquiring modern air fleet, command systems and weaponry are in the phases of accomplishment.\n\nHe said more punch and agility is being added to the PAF.\n\nHe recalled that three years back when he took over the command the force was facing numerous challenges in various sectors and all these were successfully met by the grace of Allah Almighty during the course.\n\nHe reposed confidence in the new leadership of the force and said Air Chief Marshal Rao is competent enough to take the PAF forward to make it a force of the 21st century.\n\nHe urged the officers and men to fully equip themselves with the modern knowledge and skill to step forward as a real force of 21st century.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by former Air Chiefs and their families, besides senior serving PAF officers, men and their families.', ''),

They were taken onboard two Pakistan Navy (PN) main warships, PNS Tippu Sultan and PNS Tariq, to witness the first day of the operational sea of the Aman exercise that remained in progress from March 9 to March 12.Out of the 38 countries from different regions, navies of 11 countries actively participated in the Aman 2009 maritime exercise, bringing their ships, aircraft, naval officers, and sailors.\n\nEight warships of Pakistan Navy and 11 other ships from navies of the USA, the UK, Bangladesh, China, Australia, France and Malaysia were present on the first day of the operational sea phase of Aman exercise.In the evening, these ships also took part in a surface firing competition in the open sea. The main surface guns of ships fired at a glowing target in the open sea dropped at a distance of seven to eight Nautical Miles.\n\nAs the two PN warships, of type-21 class and Britain made, had to remain in the open seas during four days of operational phase of the Aman, news personnel were shifted from PNS Tippu Sultan and PNS Tariq to two missile boats of PN for their return journey to the naval dockyard at the Karachi port. This shifting – in maritime and naval warfare terms – is called Personnel Replenishment at sea between ships.The personnel replenishment exercise in the open sea took place through small “Zulu” boats. A wooden ship ladder and two ropes hanging seaward vertically from the ship were used to help descending journalists; an activity demanding mental alertness and physical balance to enable them to safely get down onto the small rubber-inflated boats.\n\n\nIt took at least 90 minutes for the crews of PNS Tippu Sultan and PNS Tariq and those riding the Zulu boats including the PN divers to ensure the safe transfer of journalists from the ships to the missile boats.Officials and sailors at the warships and missile boats said that the phenomenally calm and smooth sea conditions during personnel replenishment were instrumental in the safe vessel-to-vessel transfer of media personnel, which included a female journalist.PN spokesman Commander Salman Ali said that by involving the media in the personnel replenishment exercise between ships, they were given a chance to have a glimpse of the outstanding mental and physical alertness, fitness, and determined ruggedness required of the seafarers associated with the country’s naval force.\n\nThe dropping of PN commandos on deck of moving ships through Sea King helicopters was also highly appreciated by news personnel.Lieutenant Zia, who led the squad of Special Service Group of the navy which landed on PNS Tippu Sultan, said that the aerial dropping technique of commandos, which is otherwise called Visit Boat Search and Seize operation against enemy ships, had attained salience once again in the backdrop of international maritime efforts against pirates operating off the coast of Somalia.The visiting newsmen also witnessed joint flypast by helicopters, maritime surveillance aircraft and fighter jets from Pakistan Navies and naval forces of other participating countries. The participation of P-3C Orion of the Japanese navy and Mirage-5 fighter jets of No. 8 Squadron of PN were the distinguishing features of the flypast.\n\nAlouette helicopters of PN performed deck landing on warships. Helicopters of other participating naval forces performed cross deck landing on each other’s ships.Talking to media personnel, Commanding Officer of PNS Tippu Sultan Captain Zubair Shafique said that warships from different navies of the world had been participating in the sea exercise to understand operational procedures utilised by other naval forces against common maritime threats.He added that the joint exercise would help in increasing interoperability of various naval forces against common maritime menaces of terrorism, piracy, drug, and human smuggling.', ''),

Note for the grips if it suits youur hand.\n\n5- You may also visit some good dealer (Senior members can point you about that), negotiate to test a few rounds from some used / 2nd hand pistols offering him to pay the bullet price. Some of the dealers do have a separate room / area for the test shoot.\n\n6- Select any 3- best guns (that match your taste) from the pool, stick to their details / versions / senior members advice and pick the best you like the most.\n\n7- After purchase, try to shoot a few rounds on some range, rather to fire in air, master up for the Field Stripping and gun care.\n\nHAPPY SHOOTING', ''),

SX3s are actually manufactured by Browning for Winchester (sister company) in their Belgian plant. The retail price in US is about $1200. Someone is offering it for PRK225,000/-. That is almost 100% margin on US price. I like the gun, and have a 24hrs hold on it. I haven''t bought a shotgun for a couple of years now, so I wanted to ask members whether the price was right?\n\nWhat troubles me is that a Benelli M3, in similar specifications was also available for about the same price.

(8281, ' Brother, a 22" barrel has its limitations when it comes to hunting. Out of my limited experience, I can say that with this barrel length one can shoot within 25 meter range and its very difficult to get this close to the subject unless its domesticated or  one is a very quick shooter while bush-beating partridges & quails. secondly, pump-actions are not good for quick follow shots as one gets distracted for a good ONE second while pumping and also the flow of barrel is lost. Just for reference, it takes about three seconds for a partridge to get out of a gun''s range even if it takes off from within 10 feet from the shooter.\n\nAlthough my personal preference is a single trigger over/under, rationally, semi-auto is an all-rounder hunting gun.\n\nIn short, considering price, variation of chokes & barrels, weight, ease in shooting, availability, resale etc etc, an ideal all purpose hunters''s gun could be a Turkish semi-auto. They come with 3-5 chokes, two barrels, magazine extension tube, stock pads etc. As you must be aware, they are available from 35k to 85k in all major cities. So far Sarsilmaz and others from Turkey have very positive reviews from actual users.

(8314, ' The caliber is great. Compare 9mm and 30 bore bullet side by side. The cartridge width is almost same. The .30 cartridge is longer than 9mm, meaning there in more gun powder in .30 than in 9mm. The power is further enhanced by the fact that .30 bullet/projectile is smaller than 9mm and is more pointed(aerodynamic). So .30 gets more power to mass (of projectile) ratio than 9mm. The only reason .30 caliber is not liked by many is because TT is terrible in handling/grip, too many substandard fakes and low magazine capacity. \n\nIMHO, the day you get a reliable/dependable .30 pistol with 15+ capacity mag and good grip, it will be the largest selling pistol of all times; globally.

Magazine capacity 12 cartridges, in a round drum magazine. Trigger system double action. In other words, a 12 cartridge holding 12 gauge revolver! Faboulous. The original thing was South-african, and has been banned in U.S. terming it more of an Assault rifle than a defensive Repeater/Shotgun. It has a top folding stock, and a forward grip, which when twisted slightly and moved back ensures extraction of the fired empty cartridge. A perfect gun for both assault and defence, and no P.B licence required, for an otherwise dangerous machine of a weapon. It has a nickname of "Streetsweeper" and was widely used in South-Africa during Aparheid regime to control street mobs and riots. Google it up and let me know your comments/experience, if anybody there has used it, before I place my order.', ''),

(8414, ' Ak47 ....Its definately an eye catcher some pros and cons of the striker that came upon while googling on it....The key advantage of the Striker and Protecta shotguns is their large magazine capacity...slower reloading, especially when compared to the recent box magazine-fed combat shotguns, like Italian Franchi SPAS-15 or Russian Saiga-12. This gun, especially in its earlier Striker form, is also much more dangerous to the shooter in the case of the hang-fire, because the "skipped", hang-fired round will remain in the cylinder until removed manually, and may cause damage to the shooter if exploded not behind the barrel.The Protecta shotgun has a manually rotating cylinder instead of the clock-spring clockwork. The front vertical grip can be swung to the right and back. This movement will rotate a barrel shroud and a pivoting arm, linked to it, which, in turn, will rotate a cylinder for 1/12 of turn, to place a next chamber behind the barrel. The spent cases are ejected automatically from the chamber at the moment of the next shot, by using a small amount of powder gases propelled back from the fired chamber. The last spent case (or unfired cartridges) can be removed using the spring-loaded ejector rod at the right side of the barrel', ''),

(8429, ' Sometimes the jokes explain it all better than textbooks or expert analysis!\n\n\nTHE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS EXPLAINED\n\nPajja is the proprietor of a Siri-Paya and Nehari Shop in Lahore . Sales are low and, in order to increase them, he comes up with a plan to allow his customers to eat now and pay later. He keeps track of the meals consumed on a ledger.\n\nWord gets around and as a result increasing numbers of customers flock to Pajja’s shop. Pajja’s suppliers are delighted and are very willing to sell more and more raw materials for the meals he prepares. Pajja shows them his ledger of receivables and they extend him credit.\n\nA young and dynamic customer service consultant at the local bank recognizes these customer debts as valuable future assets and gives Pajja a credit line and then increases Pajja’s borrowing limit.\n\nTaking advantage of his customers'' freedom from immediate payment constraints, Pajja jacks up the prices of his Nehari and Siri-Paye. Customers dont mind as they are not required to pay on the spot. Sales volume increases massively; Banks and suppliers lend more; Pajja opens more outlets. He sees no reason for undue concern since he has the debts of the customers as collateral.\n\nAt the bank''s corporate headquarters, expert bankers recognize Pajja''s customer loans as assets and transform these customer assets into BONDS. These negotiable instruments are given exotic names such as SIRIBOND, PAYABOND, MAGHAZBOND AND BONGBOND. These securities are then listed on the Stock Exchange and traded on markets worldwide. No one really understands what the names mean and how the securities are guaranteed but, nevertheless, as their prices continuously climb, the securities become top-selling items.\n\nOne day, although the prices are still climbing, a credit risk manager of the bank decides that the time has come to demand payment of one of the debts incurred by Pajja. Pajja in turn asks his clients to pay up. One by one they refuse; the clients cannot pay back the debts. Pajja refuses to serve them any more. The clients stop coming.\n\nPajja is really screwed now. He cannot fulfill his loan obligations and therefore claims bankruptcy. All Bonds drop in price by between 80 to 95%.\n\nThe suppliers of Pajja, having granted generous payment due dates and having invested in the securities are faced with similar problems. The meat supplier defaults on payment to the sheep and cattle supplier and claims bankruptcy. The atta supplier is taken over by a competitor; Pajja lays off the cook and staff. Bankruptcies soar, unemployment mushrooms.\n\nThe bank that lent the money in the first place is set to collapse. It is saved by the Government following dramatic round-the-clock consultations by leaders from the governing political parties with Pajja commuting back and forth in his Executive jet and Mercedes 500SEL, brokering the deal.\n\nThe funds required to save the economic collapse are obtained by a tax levied on the citizens, most of whom do not eat Nehari or Siri-paye.\n\nUNDERSTOOD?', ''),

The POF5 sells here for about the same price, and I thought it was expensive. As a domestic product, when there''s no transcontinental shipping or brokerage fees involved, one would think that should be reflected in the price. Besides, the local market is a great place to gain fans and supporters for a new offering, but companies must not insult the buying public''s intelligence. In today''s economy, it takes all but a few clicks to find out what a product is selling for on the other side of town, or the other side of the world.', ''),

(9015, ' [b]Chinese J-10 Fighter Jet In Televised Drama, Engine failure[/b]\n\nEngine failure forced one of China’s most advanced fighter jets to make an emergency landing. \n\nIn a rare move, the normally secretive People’s Liberation Army allowed state television to report the incident and even provided footage of the jet as it struggled to remain balanced in the air.\n\nDiplomats said that the incident underscored the problems the PLA has had developing an engine for the fighter. "They will be very disappointed by this,” one said.\n\nThe J-10, which China has taken about 20 years to make, was on a training exercise with deputy regiment air force commander Li Feng at the controls. He tried to exercise a tricky manoeuvre at an altitude of 4,500 metres when the engine failed, state media reported. Realising the the jet could lose power at any time, he requested permission to return.\n\nStiill seven kilometers from the airfield, the engine stopped and the jet began to lose altitude at a rate of 25 metres per second. The pilot succeeded in gliding the fighter onto the runway without power. The rear parachute also failed, but he succeeded in bringing the fighter to a halt after taxiing for some 1,400 metres down the runway. The entire landing took 104 seconds, state television said. The success of the pilot may have influenced their decision to broadcast the landing.\n\nOne aviation expert said that the skill of the pilot should not be underestimated. He said: “A fighter jet glides like a soggy brick.”\n\nIt was the first reported incident involving the J-10 since it was unveiled with great fanfare before an international audience at the Zhuhai air show in southern China last November. It received several impressive reviews of its performance at the time. Vladimir Karnozov, a Mosco-based aerospace journalist, wrote a blog calling the J-10 the real deal. He said: “The pilot did none of the show tricks like post-stall or tail slide or pitch-back, but turns were very tight, initial rate of turn very high. It was clear there is a lot of potential in this airplane to achieve the same maneuvers more quickly. “\n\nHowever, diplomats said question marks still hung over the plane, which has taken some 20 years to develop. Most involve its engine.\n\nAll the J-10 fighters built so far are believed to be powered by a single Russian-built turbofan engine, the AL-31F. Diplomats said that there had been problems adapting the plane and the engine to fit, adding that the use of a Russian engine could affect Chinese plans to sell the jet overseas. China already has an order for 40 of the fighters from Pakistan.\n\nThey said that China was keen to install its own engine in the aircraft but so far this had not been possible. Chinese media said last year that the PLA had finally developed an indigenous turbojet engine called the WS-10A, or "Taihang", as it is known commercially, and had started installing it in the J-10.\n\nChinese-made engines are currently used in the twin-engine J-8, which is based on the design of the Russian Sukhoi-15 fighter, but these are still being adapted to the far more rigorous demands of a single-engine jet. The Chinese engine is believed to take twice as long as the Russian one to reach the same level of performance: the lag of up to one minute could mean the difference between life or death for a pilot needing to restart his engine or eject. The aviation expert said: “These single-engine fighters are often known as widow-makers.”\n\nExperts said that China was apparently still trying to adapt its domestic engines to power the J-10. Its programme faces additional urgency since the PLA may be keen to use fully homemade fighters once it builds its own aircraft carrier. Several senior officers have indicated China’s construction of such a group is now only a matter of time.\n\nlink\n\n[url]http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/worl...icle5961023.ece[/url]', ''),

Beijing said the surveillance ship was engaged in illegal activities.\n\nAdmiral Timothy Keating, head of the US Pacific Command, said the incident showed that China''s "behavior as a responsible stakeholder has yet to be consistently demonstrated."\n\n"The Impeccable incident is certainly a troubling indicator that China, particularly in the South China Sea, is behaving in an aggressive, troublesome manner and are not willing to abide by acceptable standards of behavior or rules of the road," he told a Senate hearing.\n\nBut Keating said that US military relations with China have been improving and welcomed an easing of tensions between Beijing and Taipei since Taiwan elected Beijing-friendly President Ma Ying-jeou last year.\n\nThe naval showdown came days before Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi visited Washington, where he voiced hope for a strong relationship with President Barack Obama''s administration.\n\nlink\n[url]http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/navy/China_aggressive_on_sea_US_commander120017376.php[/url]', ''),

Reminiscent of the DSI modification first tested on a Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 30 in 1996, this modification saves weight and improves specific engine power and stealth. It also cleans up the J-10''s previous complex inlet configuration, which was reportedly prone to vibration.\n\nChina''s research on DSIs dates back to the late 1990s, with Chengdu''s 611 institute for aerospace design having been assisted by government-funded research at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\nIn addition, this J-10 variant has a new infrared search and track (IRST) system canted to the right of the windscreen, with an apparent smaller optical sensor below the radome area, and a new electronic systems faring near the top of the vertical stabiliser, also similar to that of the FC-1. In addition, the radome has been changed to a flatter F-16-like profile. The back-leaning angle of the radome attachment bulkhead gives credence to web reports suggesting it also has a new radar, perhaps a new electronically scanned array, either active or passive.\n\neither a new more powerful version of the Russian Saturn AL-31FN or the Chinese developed Liming WS-10A. While these could follow later, this aircraft appears to be an incremental upgrade for the J-10, which would be consistent with previous Chinese practice for indigenously designed combat aircraft. Nevertheless, these upgrades, perhaps to include a new radar, would enhance the aerial combat flexibility of the J-10, positioning it to better compete with the Shenyang J-11B for People''s Liberation Army Air Force orders. [b]It is also suggested that this J-10 is an initial development for what may become the ''FC-20'' to be purchased by Pakistan.[/b]\n\nFor some time there have been indications, mainly from Russian industry sources, that Chengdu has been developing advanced variants of the J-10. The most near-term upgrade cited by these sources would have used a thrust-vectored version of the AL-31FN to power a potential aircraft carrier variant or one better suited for high-altitude airfields near India.\n\nSource: JDW', ''),

(9389, ' [quote=Balazona]Yes,the springs weak with use only.in ur car u can see they get weak with use when u drive the car.if u park ur car ur car springs will not get weak.i hope u got it now.[/quote]\nI think its not the right example. When a car is parked, its springs are well within ''NORMAL'' operational load position like an empty magazine. To compare it accurately, load a car so much weight that the springs are collapsed fully. Leave it for a couple of weeks and see the results for yourself.\n\nFurther I''ll refer to the air gun manufacturers'' recommendation that the gun must not be kept loaded for longer durations. For them, the longer is just few minutes not hours or weeks for that matter. Needless to say that airguns'' primary component is a spring and we are talking about firearms where these components are supportive not primary. Therefore any decrease in their strength may go unnoticed specially in pump actions.\n\nTo my understanding its the same thing as the barrel life. Its going to take ages to test its claimed life, which [i]most[/i] of the users will never reach. And even if they do, its not that expensive to replace after all that time.', ''),

After I repeatedly failed to get it fixed by a gunsmith of good repute, I stripped it, made some observations and checked out the mechanism. I was surprised that the magazine was defective and the bullet was not coming out of it properly. It was going towards left top and hitting the slide and getting stuck.

Detailed stripping is trickey if you don''t observe closely how each part is placed, you may be in trouble to reassmblr it.

The pilot ejected and was not hurt, though the jet was destroyed.\n\nThe plane was designed in the 1980s to provide a stealthy method to enter Soviet air space and strike Soviet bombers if the USSR attempted a nuclear strike.\n\nOnce the Cold War ended, the Air Force found a new mission for the F-22 as a long-range fighter with a sophisticated stealth design and state-of-the-art equipment that no other plane could rival.\n\nHowever, the rising cost of the plane and numerous design and software problems threatened the program, which was almost eliminated by Congress.\n\nIn the end, the aircraft survived, and most of the problems were fixed -- except for the price tag, which forced the Air Force to buy fewer aircraft.\n[b]If you include R&D cost, it comes out to around $342 mil a plane.[/b]', ''),

(9778, ' [b]DCNS Hopefull To Sell A Marlin Ssk To Pakistan Navy[/b]\n\nDCNS is poised to open formal negotiations with Greece for the sale of up to six FREMM multimission frigates, said Alain Fougeron, the sales and marketing executive vice president at the French naval company. "We are preparing for negotiations, which have not yet started," for four or six ships, including options, he said March 24. "We hope to close the negotiations as soon as possible. That goes for both sides."\n\n[img]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScuBrgcsNGI/AAAAAAAAA48/fO-sKBryswI/s400/U214+SSK.png[/img]\n\nFougeron gave no price details on the 6,000-metric-ton Frégate Européene Multimission (FREMM), co-developed by France and Italy. But the economic crisis has hit Greece hard, making it tougher for the government to pay for planned purchases of the new warships and combat aircraft. DCNS asked European missile maker MBDA to be part of the French warship offer, which beat proposals from other companies, including Italy''s version of the FREMM, Fougeron said. The Italian FREMM has a different combat management system, he said. MBDA has Finmeccanica of Italy as a shareholder alongside EADS and BAE Systems. DCNS has a cooperation agreement with local partner Elefsis Shipyards. DCNS last year opened an office in Athens.\n\n[img]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScuBrPA1IgI/AAAAAAAAA40/lo1ikkFJTvI/s400/MARLIN+SSK2.jpg[/img]\n\nIn January, Greek Defense Minister Vangelis Meimarakis said the authorities had authorized bilateral talks with France to buy six FREMM warships and 15 Super Puma search-and-rescue helicopters. The estimated price of a FREMM ship is about 500 million euros ($678 million). DCNS believes the Hellenic Navy''s difficulties in getting a German-built U-214 conventional submarine into service could be helpful in efforts to sell a French boat to Pakistan. Meimarakis said that Greece is trying to renegotiate a contract for a German-built conventional submarine because of technical problems, Reuters reported Jan. 22. The German four-submarine contract is reported to be worth about four billion euros, with three other 214 boats under contract. The difficulties of the Greek submarine, the Papanikolis, has probably led Pakistan to reconsider a planned buy of the 214 from Howaldstwerke Deutsche-Werft (HDW), leaving the door open to DCNS'' Marlin, an all-French derivative of the Franco-Spanish Scorpene. HDW is part of Germany''s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.\n\n[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScuBq6NNxEI/AAAAAAAAA4s/VKmPkwJ_ARY/s400/MARLIN+SSK.jpg[/img]\n\n"We are in the game in Pakistan," Fougeron said. The last of three Agosta 90 submarines built for Pakistan''s Navy took to the sea in September, equipped with the Mesma air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, Fougeron said. The AIP system, which allows the submarine to operate for longer periods underwater, has been used heavily and is working well, he said. Two earlier Agosta 90 submarines have been retrofitted with the air-independent propulsion system.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/03/hellenic-navys-difficulties-in-getting.html[/url]', ''),

(10090, ' [b]Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani assures support for $28 b Armed Forces Development Plan 2025[/b]\n\nPrime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani on Saturday assured the government’s full support for the $28 billion Armed Forces Development Plan 2025 (AFDP), official sources told. The cabinet’s defence committee, headed by Gilani, discussed various dimensions of national defence and security, and also reviewed the AFDP 2025 in detail. The AFDP, started in 2004-05, was initially estimated at $15 billion and expected to be completed by 20014-15, but it was later enhanced to 2024-25 with a total outlay of $28 billion, the sources said.\n\n\nThe government is allocating over a $1 billion annually to cater to the country’s defence needs, which include acquisition of latest weapons, aircraft and enhancing the country’s weapons manufacturing capability. Despite the ongoing financial crunch, the government has met the AFDP’s requirements in the current fiscal year. The sources said when the budget 2008-09 was announced, allocations for salaries were not met completely, as there had remained a shortfall of a few billion rupees.\n\n\nTo meet the financing shortfall, an additional allocation of Rs 10 billion was approved for the three forces. With the addition, the total outlay of the defence budget has increased from Rs 295 billion to Rs 305 billion for 2008-09, the sources added. The ministers of defence, foreign affairs and information, and the advisers on finance and interior were present in the meeting along with the chiefs of the country’s armed forces.\n\n\nUnder the development plan, Pakistan would purchase defense and armed weapons to fill its defense need for next 16 years, sources added.

(remeber, by putting your SIM in the cellphone, you will be registered in the handset IMEI forever).\n\n2- Always ask for a reciept, both for the new and 2nd hand equipement.\n\n3- Make sure that your NIC Copy is not misused and be aware of all numbers that are currently registered in your name with any operator.\n\n4- Remember, An active Connection with SIM ( Subscriber Identification Module) is your tracker if Mobile Equipement is on.\n\n5- Do not let any other person to use your cellphone, untill unless you are completely aware of him/her.\n\nAbove mentioned points are from my personal experience (both harsh and lovely).

The Pakistan government has acquired four of this aircraft model, which will be used to transport government officials of that country. This transaction is already included in Embraer’s fourth quarter firm order backlog.\n\n[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScspAUVC7wI/AAAAAAAAA34/TUjtlhJdZzA/s400/phenom-paquistao.jpg[/img]\n\n“Embraer is honored to enjoy the confidence of Pakistan’s Government for operating our products,” said Orlando José Ferreira Neto, Embraer Executive Vice President, Defense and Government Market. “The Phenom 100 is an excellent aircraft that meets a broad range of transportation demands and, with the way opened by the Pakistan Air Force on the international market, we are seeing a growing interest in this model in several other regions.”\n\nThis is the first Embraer aircraft delivered to a customer in Pakistan, and it is also the first Phenom 100 to be operated by a government. The countrys Air Force chose this model after carrying out a detailed analysis of such aspects as performance, comfort, technology, acquisition price, and operating costs, among others.\n\n[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/Scso_wwYINI/AAAAAAAAA3w/HWgqwVdxpIs/s400/dj_phenom_100_image.jpg[/img]\n\nThe Phenom 100 jet can accommodate up to eight occupants. Its range of 1,178 nautical miles (2,182 km), including NBAA IFR fuel reserves, means the aircraft is capable of flying nonstop from Islamabad (Pakistan) to Karachi (Pakistan) or Katmandu (Nepal), from New York to Miami, in the U.S., or from London to Rome, in Europe. The jet was certified in December 2008, and proved to be the fastest and to have the largest baggage capacity in its category. The Phenom 100 has the latest in cockpit design and a private aft lavatory as one of its most competitive features.\n\n[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScslptKm7fI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/nW1_IlJMxFE/s400/phenom100_3.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_htvjsmtPrmc/ScslptMbD8I/AAAAAAAAA3Q/JyeIFn_4UPw/s400/00106_bmw-aircraft-design.jpg[/img]', ''),

Officials said Pakistan has briefed such countries as Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Sudan on the new fighter, jointly developed with China.Under an agreement with Beijing, a majority of the JF-17 could be produced and assembled in Pakistan."The airplane would reach close to the capabilities of existing U.S. and Russian aircraft, but for about half the price," an official said.\n\n\nPakistani Defense Secretary Shahid Siddiq said eight countries have expressed interest in JF-17. So far, no export sales have been announced. In March 2009, Pakistan signed a contract for 42 JF-17s for the air force. The contract with China''s state-owned CATIC, called for coproduction of the aircraft, with the expectation that 15 would be manufactured in the first year of the project by the state-owned Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has sought to become a significant military supplier to Gulf Cooperation Council and Middle East states. So far, Pakistan''s leading military clients have been Saudi Arabia and Sudan.The JF-17 program was launched in 1998 and the design was completed three years later.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/03/pakistan-marketing-its-new-jf-17.html[/url]', ''),

On his arrival at the Base, he was presented with a guard of honour by smartly turned out contingent of Pakistan Air Force. The New Air Chief will undertake series of visits to various PAF Bases and would unfold his vision for preparing PAF to meet the challenges of 21st century Air Operations. While referring to the incidence of 26/11, the Air Chief lauded the performance of PAF Airmen, who played a vital role in averting an imminent war. He said, “ when the Surgical Strikes threat was about to cross the threshold, I devised an Air Strategy plan and unfolded it to the then CAS and within 4 ? 5 hours the whole PAF was on Red Alert Status and present everywhere to defend and launch offensive operations.”\n\nWhile talking to the pilots, the Air Chief said, “you are cutting edge of PAF and Nation pins high hopes on you to defend, deliver and sacrifice and keep up the glorious traditions of PAF air warriors.” He emphasized upon them to maintain the highest level of standards pertaining to various aspects of Air Operations. Addressing a joint session of Airmen, the Air Chief said “the cardinal points of my vision are Integrity, Professional Excellence and Teamwork. The top most priority will remain operational preparedness of PAF. Today, the PAF is passing through transit phase, we will be handling and operating old and new weapon systems of various capabilities, you are required to maintain these assets for their optimum performance.\nThe induction of new systems programme is on track. These systems will be requiring knowledge based training, thus my focus will be on modern training techniques and on flight safety. All measures and quality assurance procedures must be adopted for preserving the assets of PAF.” Earlier, on his arrival at the Base, the Air Chief was received by Air Vice Marshal Attique Rafique, Air Officer Commanding, Central Air Command, Pakistan Air Force and Air Commodore M Ashfaque Arain, Base Commander PAF Base, Mushaf.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/03/pafs-effective-strategy-by-paf-averted.html[/url]', ''),
(10139, ' An old cowboy named Dick was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in Colorado, when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced out of a dust cloud towards him.  The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leans out the window and asks the old cowboy, ‘If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, Will you give me a calf?’ \n\nDick looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ‘Sure, why not?’\n\nThe yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.  The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg , Germany.   \nWithin seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.  Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer and finally turns to the cowboy and says, ‘You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.’\n\n‘That’s right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,’ says the old cowboy.  He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on amused as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.\n\nThen Dick says to the young man, ‘Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?’  \nThe young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ‘Okay, why not?’\n\n‘You’re a Congressman for the U.S Government’, says Dick. \n\nWow! That’s correct,’ says the yuppie, ‘but how did you guess that?’\n\n‘No guessing required.’ answered the old cowboy. ‘You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked.

There is a probaganda by people against the weapon who''ve either only used Glock in full auto accessorised with an auto kit (which makes the weapon highly inaccurate, well atleast in the hands of poeple who cannot handle a weapon in full auto) or people who never got the opportunity to get their hands on one. \n\nFiring on automatic is pretty accurate with tight groups ... though again is not recommended for people who are not capable of handling a firearm in full auto and wouldnt be recommended for SD. But in the hands of someone :cool: who IS capable of handling a fire arm in full auto very efficiently, there is no machine pistol available in the market that would second a Glock 18 specially in close quarter and less than 25 mtr situations. \n\nFYI, all automatic weapons are effective when [b]intermittently fired[/b] i.e. in small bursts.

(10188, ' The illustrations and instructions in this article are based on the Beretta 391 Urika, but they are also valid for the other versions of the 391, including sporting models, Teknys, etc. Other models of Beretta gas-operated shotguns which have the recoil spring in the stock are very similar and the pictures and instructions here may be helpful, keeping in mind that there are some variations. This would include older models like the AL-1 through AL-3 and the 300 series (300-303), and current models 390 and 3901. This article does not apply at all to the Beretta gas-operated guns that have the recoil spring in the forearm (older Lark series and the current Xtrema) nor to Beretta''s recoil-operated shotguns (ES100 Pintail or Victoria). \n\n\nParts diagrams and owner''s manuals: I will refer to the parts by Beretta''s names for them (except where their names are counterintuitive) and will list the part numbers from Beretta''s 391 parts diagram, which is available here: \n[url]http://www.berettaservices.com/Moduli/C[/url] ... eal391.pdf \n\nThe parts diagram for the 390 is also available, but I will not use the 390 part names or numbers. [url]http://www.berettaservices.com/Moduli/C[/url] ... eal390.pdf \n\nOwner''s manuals are available here: \n[url]http://www.berettaservices.com/index.aspx?m=53&did=652[/url] \n\nDisclaimer: Beretta says some of the things discussed here should be done by a gunsmith, but I don’t know anybody who pays attention to that. If you get your gun apart and lose some parts or can’t get it back together, don’t blame me. It ain''t my fault, I just do what the voices tell me to. \n\n[b]Removing the barrel: [/b]\n \nCock the gun and leave the bolt open. Unscrew the forend nut (Beretta''s name for it is forend cap part 55), pull the forearm off, and pull the barrel off. The piston (part 48 ) normally remains on the magazine cap shaft (part 45), but if the gun is dirty it may stick inside the gas cylinder on the barrel. To store the gun with the barrel off, put the forearm back on, insert the red plastic bushing that came with the gun, and screw the forend nut on. The plastic bushing is not used when the barrel is on, but it is needed to keep the forend nut from jamming when the barrel is off. Caution: do not let the bolt slam shut with the barrel off, as it may cause the piston to damage the forearm or stick inside the forearm. If you want to store the gun with the bolt closed, hold the cocking handle and ease it shut. \n\nCaution: When you put the forearm on, make sure the U-shaped projection of wood at the base of the forearm goes into the recess on the front of the receiver. You should not see any gap between the forearm and the receiver. If you don’t get that projection seated properly, you could damage the forearm. \n\nEven if the gun is stored with the barrel on, the forend nut should be removed often, cleaned, and greased (I recommend Anti-seize, but any lubricant is better than none) to keep it from rusting and freezing in place. \n\nRemoving the bolt assembly: The bolt can be removed with the trigger group either in or out, but you might as well go on and take the trigger out (instructions below). It is a lot easier to get the bolt back in if the trigger group is out - with the trigger in, it can be hard to get the connecting rod into the recoil spring guide. If the trigger group is in, the hammer has to be cocked or the connecting rod won''t come out or go back in. That is one of the reasons you should make sure the gun is cocked and put the safety on before you start to remove either the bolt or the trigger group. (The safety has been removed from the gun illustrated, because it is dedicated to clay shooting only). \n\nRemove the forearm and barrel, and slide the piston off the magazine cap shaft. While holding on to either the cocking lever or the sleeve around the magazine (part of the operating rod part 47), press the bolt release button (Beretta calls it the cartridge latch part 35) and ease the bolt and operating rod forward. Caution: do not let the bolt slam forward when the barrel is off. Remove the cocking handle (part 72) by pulling it straight out. This may be hard to do on a new gun, but gets easier after it has been done a few times. If necessary, pull with pliers padded to prevent damage, or tie a strong cord to it and jerk. There is nothing holding it in but a spring-loaded ball that fits in a shallow groove on the side of the lever. Pull the sleeve part of the operating rod forward, and the bolt will come out of the receiver. It will not come out if the hammer is in the "fired" position. \n\n \nThe bolt is in two parts: The chrome part is the breech bolt (part 63), while the black part is the breech bolt slide (part 57). Caution: when the two parts of the bolt are separated, the pin that holds the connecting rod (part 58 ) to the slide can fall out and get lost. \n\nCaution: If you separate the connecting rod from the slide, make sure you turn it the right way when you put it back on. It should be turned so it is (as a mathematician would say) “concave up”: in other words, the cross-section of the rod should look like this \\_/, not like this /``\\ . \n\nTo put the bolt back in, put the breech bolt and slide together, hold them in place in front of the receiver on top of the magazine tube, drop the connecting rod down in the receiver, and just barely start the end of the bolt into the receiver. Put the operating rod on the magazine tube and hook the end of the operating rod into the side of the slide. Now slide the whole works down into the receiver. Make sure the end of the connecting rod goes into the cup on the end of the recoil spring guide (part 12 ). You should now be able to work the bolt up and down, compressing the recoil spring, by holding onto the operating rod. Once the bolt is in, stick the cocking handle back in. \n\nSometimes the bolt will seem to go in OK but it won''t slide back all the way. If that happens, make sure the end of the connecting rod is in the cup on the recoil spring guide. If it is, make sure the connecting rod isn''t installed upside-down (see the "caution" paragraph above). If that is OK, the bolt probably went into the receiver cocked a little bit to one side. Take the bolt out and start over, making sure the bolt goes in straight. It might help to turn the bolt a little bit clockwise as seen from the front as it goes in. \n\n[b]Replacing the firing pin or its spring: [/b]\n \nTo remove the firing pin and spring, the “firing pin retaining pin” (part 67) must be driven out from the bottom - it cannot be driven from the top. Note that the retaining pin is staked in place - that means the top of the bolt beside the retaining pin hole has been struck with a punch to deform the metal and lock the pin in place. I’ve only removed one retaining pin, and I was able to drive it out with no trouble, but if it is staked very securely you might need to use a Dremel tool to clear off the deformed metal. I think it would be best not to remove that burr if you don’t have to - in my case, I was able to get the retaining pin out and back in (twice) and there is still enough of a burr to help hold it in place. \n\nWith the retaining pin out, the firing pin and spring just slide right out. \n\nRemoving the trigger group: This is hard to do the first time, but gets a lot easier after it has been done a few times. \n\n \nYou can remove the trigger group with the bolt in or out, but it is easier to get the bolt back in if the trigger group is already out. \n\nPut the safety on. Drive out the “trigger plate retaining pin” (part 30). This is the pin that goes through both sides of the receiver, above the front end of the trigger guard. Pull the trigger group forward a fraction of an inch - you will see a small gap open up between the back end of the “trigger plate” (part 73) and the bottom of the receiver. When new, you might have to hit it with the heel of your palm to get it to move. From this point with a new gun, it will help to get someone to hold the gun down while you pull the trigger group out. Press the bolt release button while pulling the trigger group forward and down. Putting the trigger group back in is just the reverse - remember to press the bolt release button while you put it in. After it has been out a few times, the trigger group will loosen up and it will go in and out easily. \n\nCaution: The hammer should remain cocked while the trigger group is out of the gun. There are two pins that get loose and can fall out while the hammer is in the "fired" position. These are the trigger pin (part 84) and the carrier catch plunger pin (part 96). \n\n[b]Ambidextrous safety: [/b]\n \nThe safety comes from the factory set for a right-handed shooter, but it can easily be changed for a left-handed shooter, or removed completely. \n\nThe safety button is held in place by a plunger and spring on the right side. To remove it, use a thin blade or similar tool to press the plunger in and push the button out to the left side of the trigger group. Be careful not to let the plunger and spring fly out and get lost (although the plunger often hangs up and has to be pried out if the safety is not going to be put back in.) To reverse the safety for a left-hander, just turn the button end-for-end and put it back in. \n\nIt is common for clay shooters to remove the safeties from guns that are dedicated to clay shooting only. I do that, but I do not recommend it for a gun that will be used for any purpose other than clay shooting. \n\n[b]Magazine Parts and Plug: [/b]\n \nThe magazine tube cap (Part 45, including the shaft that the piston and forend nut fit on) screws into the end of the magazine tube (part 44). There is a tiny plunger through the side of the tube to keep the cap from coming loose. Depress that plunger with a point of some kind, and unscrew the cap. If necessary, a screwdriver can be used in the end of the cap shaft. Caution: If you are not careful the magazine spring (part 42) will fly out when the cap comes off. With the spring out, you can turn the gun up and let the follower (part 41) fall out. \n\nThe magazine plug (part 43) is an aluminum rod with a head like a nail, which extends through the shaft of the magazine cap and into the magazine. It is held in place by a spring clip (magazine reducer plug retaining washer, part 46). To remove or replace the plug, pull the clip off and throw it away. Yes, I said throw it away. I didn''t make that up, one of the FAQ''s on the Beretta USA web site says throw it away - it serves no useful purpose. I guess the clip is on there to keep a new owner from thinking he got a broken gun if he turns the gun down with the forend nut off, and the plug falls out. With the clip off, just remove the forend nut to remove or replace the plug. All 391''s sold in the US (as far as I know) come with a plug installed to limit shell capacity to 1 in the chamber and 2 in the magazine, with a longer plug in the box to limit capacity to 1 and 1. With no plug, capacity is 1 and 3. \n\n[b]Removing the stock, and using stock shims:[/b] \nFirst remove the recoil pad. Depending on what kind of recoil pad you have, there might be a quick-release device or two Phillips-head wood screws. If you can’t see the screw heads, look for two tiny holes in the rubber, oil the point of the screwdriver and press it into the holes, expanding them. If there are no holes, there may be two circles about 1/4” diameter - these are rubber plugs which can be pulled out with thin-nosed pliers. \n\nThe nut which holds the stock in place takes a 13mm socket, but I have been told that a 1/2” socket is close enough to work OK. (Some older models of Beretta’s gas-operated guns might take a 19mm socket.) Getting the stock off is self-evident, but it can be tricky to get it back on. I have found that a magnet shaped like a pencil helps a lot in putting the rear plate and lock washer in place while the gun is held vertical, butt up. Then put the nut in the socket and turn the gun partly over on its side so you can get the socket inside without the nut falling out. \n\nWhat we commonly call “stock shims” consist of a front spacer (part 10) and a plate (part 15) which come in matched pairs. They can be turned different ways to produce cast off (marked DX) or cast on (marked SX) and any of several amounts of drop (marked in millimeters). Caution: It is very important that both be turned the same way. For example, if the spacer is placed on the rear of the receiver so the figures “C-60-DX” (60mm drop, cast off) are showing before the stock goes on , then the plate must be installed with the same figures showing. Mixing them can cause the stock to split due to uneven stress. \n\n[b]Replacing the recoil spring: [/b]\n \nThe recoil spring needs to be replaced periodically, because it weakens with use. Some people advise replacing it every 5,000 shots, some say 10,000. A weak spring will allow the bolt to come back too fast when the shot is fired, which over along time period can result in damage to the bolt and the receiver. The old spring will be shorter than the new one - sometimes there is a bigger difference than shown in the illustration. Replacing the recoil spring may not be as important if you only use light target ammo as it would be with heavy field loads, but it is cheap insurance anyway. The 12 gauge 391 (but not the 20 gauge) has an additional recoil absorber (part 120) in the rear of the receiver to act as a buffer. \n\nThe spring and its tube may need cleaning once in a while if you are using very dirty ammo that leaves a lot of ash. \n\nThe recoil spring cap (part 14) screws into the rear of the stock bolt tube (part 11) and there are flats on the sides for a wrench. The cap is usually fastened in place at the factory by use of a thread locker (Loctite or equivalent). That is not always true, as I had one that came from the factory with no thread locker, but most of them are locked. The cap must be heated to release the thread locker. Most people use a small propane torch, but if you don''t have one you can do it by sticking the cap through the cracked-open door of a kitchen oven preheated to around 450-500 deg. Try the wrench every 30 seconds to a minute, and the cap will come out in just a few minutes. \n\nCaution: the recoil spring is compressed and will fly out violently if not restrained. Before you get the cap completely off, stick a stiff wire or a thin nail through the holes in both sides of the tube, to hold the spring in. With the cap off, hold a rag over the end of the spring, pull the nail out, and let the spring come out gently. The spring will probably be dirty and greasy. The recoil spring guide (part 12) will slide out, but you might need to start it by pressing with a fingertip from inside the receiver. Some of the guides are longer than the one illustrated - a design change, apparently. Clean and lightly lubricate the tube. \n\nThe easiest way I have found to compress the new spring enough to get it in is to put the guide and spring in the tube, stick a thin Phillips screwdriver in the spring and push down as far as possible, then stick the nail in to hold the spring until the cap is screwed in. Both the screwdriver and the nail must be thin so the screwdriver won''t keep the nail from going in. \n\nSo, do you put Loctite on the cap when you put it back in? As far as I''m concerned, that is an open question. I don''t, and I don''t think most shooters do, but I had a cap come loose one time, letting the stock get loose. I probably just didn''t tighten it enough. I still don''t use Loctite but I pay more attention to tightening the cap. If I were shooting a very important tournament or going on the hunt of a lifetime with no backup gun, I would use Loctite, but since I switched from an O/U to an automatic I have learned from experience to carry a backup in those situations. \n\n[b]Forend nut: [/b]\n \n\nThe 391 forend nut (Beretta calls it fore-end cap, part 55) is the most ridiculously over-engineered mechanism I have ever seen. It consists of 7 parts, only 6 of which show on Beretta’s parts diagram. The parts in the illustration will go back into the nut in clockwise order: the plastic bushing first, then the washer, etc, and finishing with the lock ring (snap ring). The thin ring in the 4 o''clock position in the illustration is the part that does not show on the parts diagram. \n\nOlder forend nuts do not have the mysterious ring, confirming that it was part of a design change, and that is why it does not show up on the parts diagram. The moving part, which I call the "plunger" for lack of another name, is bigger in diameter so it fits close in the nut without a ring. I prefer that design, because the metal washer and plastic buffer are easier to get out for cleaning. I would guess that Beretta added the ring because the outer part of the nut rusts, which could cause the plunger to bind. The ring looks like stainless. I still think the old design is better, provided you don''t neglect the nut until it rusts. So why didn''t Beretta switch to a rust-resistant steel for the outer part of the nut and leave the ring out? That would have solved several problems. Beretta works in mysterious ways..... \n\nThe most important part of the nut to clean is the threads. If they are not kept clean and lubricated, they will rust and freeze onto the magazine tube cap. Removing a badly rusted nut is a major project, and preventing that is worth some effort. Fortunately, that can be done without disassembling the nut. Just remove it from the magazine cap often, flush the threads out with a solvent (Gunscrubber, brake parts cleaner, Breakfree CLP, etc) and lubricate it. I generally use a few drops of Breakfree CLP or RemOil inside the threads, but to be extra careful I apply Permatex Anti-Seize or Rig Universal grease to the threads on the magazine cap. \n\nDisassembly of the nut for a detailed cleaning is something that does not need to be done real often. In fact, if you only use your gun for hunting, and you use fairly clean-burning shells, you might get away with never disassembling it. However, if you shoot a lot and use dirty shells it will fill up with crud and stop working eventually if you don''t clean it. \n\nTo see if the nut is still working properly, place it on a hard surface like a table top, with the spring-loaded part (I will call it the plunger for lack of a better name) down, and press on the top of the nut with the heel of your hand. You should be able to feel the plunger moving on its spring. If not, you''ve got trouble, and you should have cleaned it long ago! \n\nThe first step in disassembly is removing the snap ring, and to do this you need a pair of snap ring pliers. You need to squeeze the nut to depress the plunger and take the pressure off the snap ring to make it easier to get the ring out. I have used a small vise, and a friend of mine uses a drill press, but I generally use a small pair of tongue and groove pliers (commonly called Channellocks). \n\nOnce you get the snap ring out, the plunger and spring come right out. You could just stop there and clean what you can see: in fact, some people may not even realize that the other parts are in there. To take everything out, you first have to remove the mysterious "phantom" ring that does not appear on the diagrams. Use a dentist''s pick or something similar to hook under the bottom edge of the ring, pull up a little, and work your way around pulling up just a tiny bit each time. Once you work the ring part way up, you can grab it with thin-nosed pliers and pull it on out. With the ring out, the metal washer and plastic bushing will come out if you turn the nut face down and bang it on the workbench. However, if you let the nut get real dirty before you try to clean it you may never be able to get the ring, metal washer and plastic bushing out. No matter, you can clean it pretty well with those parts still in. \n\nGetting the snap ring out and back in can be a problem. If you clean your nut often you might consider replacing the snap ring with one that does not fit quite so tight. I went to a well-stocked hardware store and asked for a snap ring to match the original, and what I got looked like the same size, but turned out to be a tad bit smaller. I suspect the original is a metric size and the replacement is an SAE size. It goes in and out a lot easier, and it holds everything in just fine. When the nut is on the gun, there is no pressure on the ring anyway, it only serves its purpose when the nut is off. \n\nThis over-engineered forend nut can be simplified and made easier to clean by removing all the internal parts and replacing them with a single spring, so the nut functions very much like the one on a Beretta 390. For more information, see: \n\n[b]Cleaning the gas ports:[/b] The gas ports are two holes in the bottom of the barrel that feed gas from inside the barrel into the gas cylinder which is welded to the bottom of the barrel. If the ports get clogged, the gun will not cycle properly. The first sign of clogged ports is weak ejection - the empty hulls will land closer to the shooter''s feet, and eventually will fail to get all the way out of the receiver. How often they need cleaning depends on how clean-burning your ammo is. They will go at least 10 times as long between cleanings with clean ammo like Rio than with dirty ammo like Federal Top Gun. Some people say they never have to clean the ports, but I had trouble when I didn''t, so it is just something you have to learn from experience. \n\n \n\nTo clean the ports, one must first disassemble the gas valve. New 391''s come with a pair of "valve hook wrenches" (part 118) to loosen the valve counter nut (part 116) and remove the valve nut (part 115). They are hard to use because the counter nut is put on very tight at the factory, and the valve nut has a long threaded portion, requiring that it be turned a lot with the wrench. Several after-market suppliers make socket wrenches that are easier to use. Beretta advises against using the after-market wrenches, because they work too well. Beretta apparently is afraid you are going to tighten the nuts so tight you damage something. I understand their point, but I have a higher regard for your intelligence than Beretta does. \n\nUse the two hook wrenches together as illustrated to break the counter nut loose. It will be easier after the first time, because you probably won''t get it back on as tight as the factory did. Next remove the valve nut and the valve, valve centering ring, and valve spring (parts 113, 114, and 117 respectively). The valve shaft (part 112) will then come out of the other end of the gas cylinder. \n\n \n\nThe gas ports can then be cleaned by sticking any suitable probe through the hole in the underside of the gas cylinder, going all the way through the cylinder and into the ports in the barrel. If the deposits are soft, a pipe cleaner may be enough, but I have seen some deposits that were much harder - it depends on the ammo you use. It may also depend on whether you keep the area "wet" with a solvent like Breakfree CLP. I like to clean the ports of a 12 gauge gun with a 1/8" drill bit held by hand, or in a small pair of vise grip pliers, or in a pin vise. A 1/8" bit is smaller than the ports (so it won''t cut the metal), but close enough to keep the port diameter from narrowing down much due to deposits. When I did the cleaning with a thinner wire I had trouble with failures to eject, because the ports were open to some extent, but too narrow. Caution: The suggestion of a 1/8" drill bit for cleaning the ports is only for a 12 gauge gun. That might be too big for a 20 gauge gun. \n\nThere are also 4 ports on the front of the gas cylinder, covered up by the valve when it is assembled. For lack of a better name, I''ll call them valve ports. These may also plug up when you use dirty ammo, and they need to be open for the valve to function properly. The valve is what makes the whole system self-adjusting (within limits) for light and heavy loads. \n\nWhen the valve is reassembled, the valve shaft should be turned the way it is in the illustration - with the longer side toward the barrel where it will protect the magazine cap shaft from the hot gas coming through the ports. The gun seems to work just fine with the valve shaft turned the wrong direction, but I suspect the shaft on the magazine cap will get dirtier faster that way. \n\nThe valve does not need any adjustment - just tighten the valve nut all the way down, then tighten the counter nut. \n\nReplacing the Carrier: Some 391 owners have had to replace their carriers, because the factory turns out one every now and then that is twisted, and causes a characteristic type of failure to feed (FTF). The front end of the second shell will hang up on the right edge of the chamber, and not enter the chamber at all. \n\nSome people say their carriers are twisted so badly you can easily see it, but mine had such a little twist in it that I still can''t see anything wrong with it. However, I did find a way to detect the twist. I lay the carrier on a smooth table top, hold it down with a fingertip, and wiggle it side-to-side. My original twisted one wobbles like a table with one leg shorter than the other 3 legs. Most replacement carriers do not wobble at all - all 4 "legs" contact the table top together, although I have seen one good carrier that would wobble just a tiny bit. If you are having failures to feed, you might be able to use this technique to test your carrier to see if it is twisted. But of course, all the wobbling in the world won''t matter if you don''t have failures to feed. The image below illustrates the technique: \n\n \n\nThe carrier lever (with its spring and plunger) is riveted to the carrier. If you have to buy a new carrier, you might want to get one with the lever already attached. Or, if you feel comfortable about removing and re-installing the rivet, just get a new rivet with the carrier and do it yourself. \n\nTo remove the carrier, just drive out the carrier pin, and make sure the small parts (two round swivel joints, spring and spring guide) don''t get lost when it all comes apart. \n\nFor instructions on how to reinstall the carrier, see section F below in "Reassembly of the trigger group". \n\n \n\n[b]Disassembly of the trigger group:[/b] It is never necessary to disassemble the trigger group for cleaning: just flush it out with a solvent and spray it with oil or CLP. Once in a while it becomes necessary to take the trigger group apart to replace a part (usually a hammer brace or hammer bush). The group looks complicated, but it really isn''t difficult to get it apart and back together. If you want to do a complete disassembly, I would suggest doing it in the following order: \n\n[b]Step1:[/b] Remove the carrier catch plunger with its pin and spring. The only reason for doing this first is it will probably fall out anyway, so you might as well get it over with. The pin is held in position by spring pressure as long as the button is out, but it will get loose if: \na: you press the button in and let the carrier drop down, holding the button in, or \nb: you pull the trigger and let the hammer go up to its "fired" position. \nDo either of those things, let the pin fall out or push it out with a punch, and the plunger and spring will come out. \n\nBe careful not let the pin fall out and get lost while cleaning the trigger group. (I was lucky, and found mine on the floor.) \n\n[b]Step 2:[/b] Remove the carrier. Just drive out the carrier pin, and make sure the small parts (two round swivel joints, spring and spring guide) don''t get lost when it all comes apart. \n\n[b]Step 3:[/b] Remove the hammer spring. (If you ever have to replace the hammer spring, you can do it without going through steps 1 and 2 first.) While holding the hammer down, pull the trigger then let the hammer rise to the ''''fired" position to relieve pressure on the hammer spring. At this point, the trigger pin is likely to fall out, but that is OK, just don''t let it get lost. Drive out the roll pin (Beretta calls it "hammer spring guide spring pin"), and the Hammer Spring Guide, Spring, and Plunger will come right out. Driving the pin out and putting it back in will be easier if you press in on the guide to take spring pressure off the pin. \n\n[b]Step 4[/b]: Drive out the hammer bush (note - it must come out on the left side, it cannot come out to the right). Once the hammer bush is out, the hammer, hammer braces, and trigger come right out. \n\nOne note about the hammer bush and its "hammer bush retaining spring ring" as Beretta calls it - most people call it a "circlip". It is a tiny piece of spring wire bent into a circle, and it goes around the hammer bush, clipping into a slot in the bush to hold it in place. The function of the circlip is to hold the trigger group pin (trigger plate retaining pin) in place by clipping into one of the two grooves in the pin (the pin actually goes through the bush). Once in a while the bush will break at the slot, allowing the circlip to come off. The pin will then fall out, and the trigger group will move, resulting in malfunctions. \n\nNote that the hammer braces are not alike - they are a mirror-image pair, left and right. They come together at the rear (smaller) end, and stand apart at the front end, one on each side of the hammer. The holes on the front ends of the braces fit over studs on the sides of the hammer. \n\n[b]Step 5[/b]. Remove small parts from the trigger. I have never removed the Trigger Spring and its Guide Plunger, because as far as I can tell the end of the plunger needs to be swaged like a rivet, and if you ever have to take it out you probably should put a new one in. To remove the sear, just drive out the trigger bush, and be careful not to lose the sear plunger and spring as the sear comes out. \n\n\nReassembly of the trigger group: You may have your favorite way of putting the trigger group back together, but this sequence works for me: \n\nA. Put the Sear Spring and Plunger in their hole in the trigger, put the Sear in place so it holds the Sear Spring Plunger in place, and insert the Trigger Bush. \n\nB. Put the trigger and trigger pin in the Trigger Plate. The Trigger Pin will probably be a little loose, so you have to hold it to keep it from falling out. \n\nC. Put the holes in the hammer braces over the studs on the sides of the hammer, and hold it all together while you put the small ends of the braces (they should be together) into the hole where the hammer spring guide plunger will go later. \n\nD. Put the base of the hammer near its final position at the front end of the trigger plate and move the other end down to the sear, so the hammer is in the cocked position. Put the hammer bush in place (from the left). \n\nE. Pull the trigger and lift the hammer to the "fired" position, put the hammer spring guide plunger, spring, and guide into the hole in the rear end of the trigger plate. Press the guide in to compress the spring while gently tapping the roll pin in to keep everything in place. Cock the hammer after you get the spring installed to put spring pressure on the trigger pin to keep it from falling back out. \n\nF. Put the carrier on. There may be several ways to do it, but the way that works for me is to put the carrier close to its final position on the trigger plate, then get the swivel joints, spring, and spring guide in place before I insert the pin. Handling all those little pieces might be awkward at first, but be patient and it will all go together eventually. You can''t get the swivel joints backwards, because only one of them will go in the carrier. Make sure you put the short end of the spring guide in the carrier swivel joint, because if you put the guide in backward the carrier won''t work right. Don''t ask me how I know that, just take my word for it.  \n\nG. Install the carrier catch plunger spring, plunger, and pin, leaving the plunger out when you finish so the pin won''t fall out.', ''),

(10206, ' Members must read it.\n\n[b]Wings Over Chagai, PAF kept the programme real safe ![/b]\n\n[b]The Role of the Pakistan Air Force during the\nMay 1998 Nuclear Tests[/b]\n\nAfter the Israeli attack on Iraq’s under-construction French-built nuclear Osirak-type reactor, Tammuz-I, south of Baghdad on 7 June 1981, Pakistan felt that it would be the next target of an Israeli misadventure. The Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) had, at first, explored the possibility of such a plan and, later, put together operational plans for a possible air strike against Kahuta in the 1980s using satellite photo and intelligence information provided by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These operational plans are still kept updated in the Headquarters of the IDF/AF and pilots of some specially assigned IDF/AF F-16 and F-15 squadrons are given special training exercises to carry out mock attacks on Kahuta. So much so that a full-scale mock-up of the Kahuta facility was built in the southern Negev Desert for the IDF/AF pilots to train on.\n\nThe Kahuta plan was made concurrently with the plan to attack Osirak using the same pilots of the Iraq mission, if it went through successfully. The Israelis planned to either use Indian airbases or fly non-stop from Israel to Kahuta while refuelling their aircraft using airborne tankers. Israeli Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft would jam Pakistani air defence radar while the Israelis took out Kahuta - or at least attempted to do so.\n\nTo this effect, India had played its part in cajoling and trying to convince Israel to carry this ill-advised plan through. However, Israel was insisting on using Indian air bases but India was reluctant to allow them such a facility for fear of sparking of another Indo-Pak war. According to a paper published by the Australian Institute for National Strategic Studies, “Israeli interest in destroying Pakistan’s Kahuta reactor to scuttle the "Islamic bomb" was blocked by India''s refusal to grant landing and refueling rights to Israeli warplanes in 1982.” India wanted to see Kahuta gone but did not want to face the blame or the retaliation nor bear any responsibility. Israel, on its part wanted it to be seen as a joint Indo-Israeli strike so that responsibility could be shared. The Reagan Administration was against this plan, not out of any love for Pakistan’s nuclear programme, but because at that time it was busy fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and considered Pakistan a key ally in the conflict. It informed Israel and India that it could not support such a plan. This plan, therefore, never materialized and was indefinitely postponed, and rightly so, after Pakistan reminded the Israelis that they were not the Iraqis and the Pakistan Air Force was not the Iraqi Air Force. Through indirect channels, Pakistan had also conveyed the message to Israel, if Kahuta was attacked, Pakistan would lay waste to Dimona, Israel’s nuclear reactor in the Negev Desert.\n\nPakistan, however, was not taking any chances. Soon after the Osirak raid in 1981, then President Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan directed PAF Air Headquarters (AHQ) to make contingency plans for a possible Israeli attack on Kahuta. In lieu thereof, the PAF Chief of Air Staff issued an Air Tasking Order to the Air Officer Commanding of the Air Defence Command to take suitable measures for the air defence of Kahuta and prepare a contingency plan for a retaliatory PAF strike on Dimona, in case Kahuta was attacked. As a follow-up to this directive, a special Operations Room was established at AHQ, Chaklala to oversee the task of defending Pakistan’s strategic nuclear facilities at Kahuta and Karachi. A study of the air defence ground environment of Kahuta was carried out and gaps and weaknesses in the air defences were filled and strengthened. On 10 July 1982, a special contingency plan was issued. In the event of an Israeli attack on Pakistan''s strategic installations, plans were drawn up for a retaliatory Pakistani strike on Dimona. The strike would be carried out by Mirage III/Vs. When Pakistan received 40 General Dynamics Block F-16A/Bs from the US from 15 January 1983 onwards, this new weapons system too was incorporated in Pakistan’s contingency plan to carry out retaliatory strikes on Dimona.\n\nIn the backdrop of the above scenario, it was, therefore, not surprising that in the aftermath of the Indian nuclear tests of 13 May 1998, Pakistan felt that there was a strong possibility of a joint Indo-Israeli strike against Pakistan''s nuclear installations. The PAF had an essential role to play in defending Pakistan''s strategic installations and airspace to thwart any such plan. The tensions were so high that a PAF F-16 flying low over the Ras Koh test site in the Chagai District of Balochistan on the eve of the Pakistani nuclear tests was, for a moment, mistaken by the personnel on the ground, to be an Israeli warplane. The incident sparked off a diplomatic squabble between Pakistan and Israel, with the Israeli Ambassador in Washington D.C. denying the existence of any such plan.\n\nThen Pakistan''s Ambassador to the United Nations, Ahmed Kamal told CNN that Pakistan had reliable information about Indian intentions to launch air strikes against Pakistan''s nuclear test facilities. Kamal told CNN that if India strikes, Pakistan''s response would be "massive" and would "bode ill for peace."\n\n"We''re involved in this threat and in making sure that it does not arise because if it does, the world must understand that Pakistan is ready, that it will react, that the reaction will be massive and dissuasive, and that it would lead us into a situation which would bode ill for peace and security, not only in the region, but beyond," Kamal said.\n\nAs soon as the decision to conduct the nuclear tests had been taken, the PAF was ordered to assume air defence duties over Chagai and the strategic nuclear installations of Pakistan, including Kahuta, Nilore, Fatehjung, Chashma, Khushab and Karachi.\n\nOperation Bedaar ’98: PAF Squadron Roles during Chagai\n\nThe PAF operations for the defence of Pakistan’s strategic nuclear installations during the May 1998 nuclear tests were codenamed “Operation Bedaar ’98” by the PAF.\n\nThis was a unique operation in which all four PAF command sector Headquarters (HQ) were involved, namely:\n\n(a) HQ NORSEC (Northern Sector) based at PAF Chaklala (Rawalpindi, Punjab) and falling under the control of the Northern Air Command (NAC) at Peshawar;\n\n(b) HQ CENSEC (Central Sector) under the Central Air Command (CAC) and both based at PAF Sargodha (Punjab);\n\n© HQ WESSEC (Western Sector) based at PAF Base Samungli (Quetta, Balochistan) also falling under the command of CAC; and\n\n(d) HQ SOUSEC (Southern Sector) based at PAF Faisal (Karachi, Sindh) and falling under the control of the Southern Air Command (SAC), also based at Karachi.\n\nNo. 6 Air Transport Squadron (ATS) Squadron, equipped with C-130 “Hercules” medium-lift tactical transport aircraft and based at PAF Base Chaklala, commanded by Group Captain Sarfraz Ahmad Khan, extended the necessary logistical support to the rest of the PAF squadrons that were being redeployed for air defence alert (ADA) duties. The Squadron carried a total of 12,66,615 lbs. loads in 71 separate sorties during the nuclear tests.\n\nNo. 7 Tactical Attack (TA) Squadron, equipped with ex-Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Mirage III EAs having recently undergone Retrofit of Strike Element (ROSE I) upgrades at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC), Kamra and based at PAF Base Masroor (Karachi, Sindh), commanded by Wg. Cdr. Shahid Mahmood were moved to PAF Base Shabaz (Jacobabad, Balochistan) for day-night ADA duties. This squadron is now due to be transformed into a multi-role squadron following the ROSE upgrades and after being equipped with new radar.\n\nThe PAF’s elite No. 9 Multi-Role (MR) Squadron “Griffins” (falling under No. 34 Wing led by Grp. Capt. Shahid Shigri), equipped with F-16As, commanded by Wg. Cdr. Azher Hasan, was deployed at PAF Samungli (Quetta, Balochistan) on 27 May 1998 to provide night-time air defence cover to the nuclear test sites at Ras Koh and Kharan.\n\nNo. 11 MR Squadron "Arrows" (No. 34 Wing), equipped with F-16A/Bs commanded by Gp. Capt. Akhtar H. Bukhari was moved to PAF Shabaz for day-night ADA duties on 24 May 1998.\n\nNo. 14 MR Squadron “The Tail Choppers”, equipped with F-7P aircraft and based at PAF Sargodha, commanded by Wg. Cdr. M. Jamshaid Khan, was deployed at PAF Base Chaklala for the point defence of KRL, Kahuta; PINSTECH, Nilore and NDC, Fatehjung.\n\nNo. 17 Air Superiority (AS) Squadron "Tigers" (falling under No. 31 Wing led by Grp. Capt. Rashid Hasan Bukhari), then equipped with F-6 aircraft and commanded by Wg. Cdr. Muhammad Jamil Memon carried out standing day-time Combat Air Patrol (CAP) missions from its parent base, PAF Base Samungli and its Forward Operational Bases (FOBs), PAF Bases Shahbaz and Sukker (Sindh) respectively. No. 17 Squadron was re-quipped with F-7PG aircraft from China on 27 March 2002.\n\nNo. 23 Squadron "Talons" (No. 31 Wing), then equipped with F-6 aircraft and based at PAF Base Samungli, commanded by Wg. Cdr. Ghulam Mustafa Abbasi was deployed at PAF Base Sukker for about a week for day-time ADA duties. Members of the Squadron who participated in the ADA duties included Wg. Cdr. Irfan Idrees, Sqn. Ldr. Khan Maqbool, Flt. Lt. Anwer Karim, Flt. Lt. S. Atta, Flt. Lt. Waqas Moshin, Flt. Lt. Zeeshan Saeed, Flt. Lt. Aamir Shaukat, Flt. Lt. Ali Asher, Flt. Lt. Nadeem Afzal and Flt. Lt. Nasir Jamal. No. 23 Squadron is also scheduled to be re-quipped with F-7PG aircraft from China later this year.\n\nAt PAF Base Samungli, F-6 aircraft belonging to the re-equipped No. 25 MR Squadron (now a SAGEM-upgraded Mirage V EF (ROSE II) squadron) and which were being kept in reduced flying status (hot storage) by the Field Maintenance Unit (FMU) at the Base were also activated and made operational in a day’s notice for emergency back-up if the need arose.\n\nNo. 314 Ground Combateers Wing of the PAF, located at PAF Samungli was tasked with providing enhanced ground security cover to the F-16s of Nos. 9 and 11 Squadrons deployed at the Base.\n\nNo. 481 Control & Reporting Centre (CRC) based at PAF Base, Lahore, along with seven Mobile Pulse-Doppler Radar (MPDR), was deployed at designated sites till the exercise was called off on 1 June 1998. No. 482 CRC based at PAF Base Malir (Karachi) deployed its MPDR-45 radar in the Sukker area at short notice on 21 May 1998. The radar handled a number of CAP missions that were launched to counter any aerial threat to the nuclear installations. No. 484 CRC based at PAF Chaklala remained on usual alert for the point defence of Kahuta. No. 486 CRC based at PAF Chaklala since November 1985 has been exclusive assigned to the task of defending Pakistan’s nuclear installations. It deployed its MPDR-90P radar at Pasni, Balochistan at short notice to detect any attack approaching from the sea. No. 403, a mobile Squadron based at PAF Base, Lahore and equipped with TPS-43G high altitude surveillance radar also participated in Bedaar’98. No. 408 Squadron based at PAF Malir, (near Karachi) and equipped with FPS-20A high-altitude long range static radar and TPS-43G high altitude radar successfully controlled a number of hot CAP mission and intercepted US Navy aircraft flying close to Pakistan’s 12 nautical mile wide territorial sea. Incidentally, this was the same squadron that participated in the several joint PAF/USN exercises called "Inspired Alert" between 1994 and 1997 in which the Squadron had experienced an opportunity to intercept aircraft like the F-14s and F-18s. No. 410 Squadron equipped with TPS-43G radar provided round-the-clock operations and controlled 26 high altitude CAPS during Operation Bedaar’98. No. 4091 Squadron based at Kirana Hills near Sargodha and equipped with Siemens MPDR-90 low-level static radar located at a height of 1,600 feet, provided a surveillance capability for the point defence of Sargodha Air Base and the Central Ammunition Depot (CAD) with its ability to detect aircraft flying at low level at extended ranges.\n\nNo. 541 Squadron, a mobile Surface-to-Air-Missile (SAM) squadron based at PAF Chaklala, and equipped with Crotale 2000 performed its duties for the point defence of Kahuta. No. 904 Squadron, based at Murree and equipped with MPDR-90S radar provided both independent and hooked-up mode operations with No. 486 CRC by providing early warning on low and medium level ingressing aircraft towards the national vital points from Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir. No. 451 Squadron, a mobile SAM squadron based at PAF Chaklala, and equipped with the Crotale 2000 SAM system provided air defence to the Kahuta and Nilore area. No. 454 Squadron, a mobile SAM squadron based PAF Chaklala, and equipped with the Crotale 2000 SAM system provided air defence cover to the national vital points. No. 455 Squadron, a mobile SAM squadron, deployed in the Kilo area and equipped with the Crotale 4000 SAM system provided air defence cover to the national vital points. No. 242 Squadron, a mobile SAM squadron, based at PAF Base Rafiqui, and equipped with the French Mistral SAM system provided air defence cover to PAF air bases. No.471 Squadron, a SAM squadron, based at PAF Chaklala and equipped with the Black Arrow (Chinese Red Flag II) high-altitude SAM system provided day-night air defence coverage upto 80,000 feet over the Kahuta, Nilore and Fatehjung area.\n\nIt was felt that a joint Indo-Israeli attack could target not only Pakistan''s nuclear installations but the nuclear test sites at Ras Koh and Kharan as well. According to intelligence reports, US and Indian intelligence did not know about the Kharan Desert site, which came as a total surprise to them. To counter any high-level threat emanating from the west or south-west, a TPS-43G high level radar had been permanently deployed in the Quetta area since October 1982. The same radar was, therefore, used to provide surveillance on all flying aircraft in the Chagai area.\n\nDalbandin Airfield had an important role to play during Pakistan’s May 1998 nuclear tests. In fact, two names gained prominence around the world during the tests: (i) Chagai Hills and (ii) Dalbandin airfield. Dalbandin is located among sand dunes some 30 km south-east of the Chagai Hills near the Pakistan-Afghanistan Border. The Koh Khambaran Massif in the Ras Koh Mountain Range, the site of Pakistan''s nuclear test, lies south of the Chagai Hills and Dalbandin.\n\nThe airfield at Dalbandin was constructed in 1935 to serve as a satellite for Samungli Air Base at Quetta. During the Second World War, it was made operational by the Royal Air Force in order to counter a possible Russian invasion through Iran and Afghanistan. During the 1970s, Dalbandin remained a disused airfield. Although the airstrip is visible from extremely high altitude, pilots making landing approaches often find the airstrip disappearing from view, with sand dunes and sand collected on the runway obscuring it - like a natural camouflage. Dust storms are frequent and cause delays in take-off and landing schedules. The airfield was taken over by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in 1985, it received a major face-lift and overhaul, which provided modern navigational aids, air traffic control facilities, a passenger terminal and a paved runway. There are regularly scheduled Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) services to the airport. While not a military facility, this airfield is available to the PAF for emergency landing and recovery of aircraft during peacetime and wartime. During May 1998, Dalbandin air field became the centre of activity for all personnel, military and civilian, flying to and from the nuclear tests sites to the rest of the country.\n\nThe nuclear devices were themselves flown in semi-knocked down (SKD) sub-assembly form on two flights of PAF C-130 Hercules tactical transport aircraft from PAF Chaklala in northern Punjab to Dalbandin airfield, escorted even within Pakistani airspace by four PAF F-16As armed with air-to-air missiles. At the same time, PAF F-7P air defence fighters, also armed with air-to-air missiles, were on CAP guarding the aerial frontiers of Pakistan against intruders. Both the nuclear devices (the bomb mechanism, the HMX explosive shields and casing) and the fissile material (the highly enriched uranium components) were divided into separate consignments and flown on separate flights of the Hercules. The PAEC did not want to put all its nuclear eggs in one basket in case something adverse was to happen to the aircraft. The security of the devices and the fissile material was so strict that that PAF F-16 escort pilots had been secretly given standing orders that in the unlikely event of the C-130 being hijacked or flown outside of Pakistani airspace, they were to shoot down the aircraft before it left Pakistan’s airspace. The F-16s were ordered to escort the C-130s to the Dalbandin airfield in Balochistan with their radio communications equipment turned off so that no orders, in the interim, could be conveyed to them to act otherwise. They were also ordered to ignore any orders to the contrary that got through to them during the duration of the flight even if such orders seemingly originated from Air Headquarters.\n\nOn 30 May 1998, when Pakistan sixth nuclear device shook the ground in the Kharan Desert, Operation Bedaar ''98 had accomplished its mission - that of deterring any misadventure by either India or Israel to strike at Pakistan''s nuclear infrastructure.\n\nBut how real was the possibility of a joint or unilateral Israeli or Indian raid on Pakistan''s nuclear installations during May 1998? The answer is that we really don''t know. The threat is of such a nature that it can neither be overestimated nor underestimated. Overestimation may lead to minor diplomatic embarrassment, but underestimation will surely lead to catastrophe for Pakistan. So Pakistan prefers to overestimate the threat and pay the price of minor diplomatic embarrassment rather than underestimate it and face the prospective annihilation. This is not to say that the threat was never there during May 1998. Pakistan preferred to be safe rather than sorry. Furthermore, there is concrete evidence that India and Israeli have been planning exactly such an operation to neutralize Pakistan''s nuclear capability. It is only the PAF and the risk of nuclear retaliation that is holding them back.\n\nAccording to an Indian official, Subramaniam Swamy, a former member of the Hindu fundamentalist and extremist Bharati Janata Party (BJP) that rules India today, Israel in 1982 asked him to sound out other Indian leaders to see if India would grant Israeli warplanes landing and refueling rights were they to undertake an Osirak-type raid against the Kahuta nuclear reactor in Pakistan. India refused, probably for a combination of reasons. As one expert on South Asia speculated:\n\n"First, the Kahuta facility is well-protected and is thus a hard target to destroy. Second and more important, India expects that any first strike by India against Kahuta would be swiftly followed by a Pakistani attack against India''s nuclear facilities. Such an exchange would leave India worse off, since any potential deterrent capability against China would thereby be eliminated. Finally, India would be wary of launching such an attack against Pakistan as it would cause not only great death and destruction to Pakistan, but could blow radioactive fall-out back over India. Such an attack against Pakistan would also alienate the Muslim Middle Eastern states whose amity India has assiduously cultivated."\n\nIn a meeting in Paris in July 1985, senior Israeli diplomats and a personal envoy of the late Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi reportedly examined the option in detail. As an incentive, Israel held out an offer to cooperate with India on military intelligence, defence production and transfer or technology. Yitzhak Rabin, then the Israeli Defence Minister, reportedly pinned a lot of hope on that meeting. But India, which had not yet forged diplomatic ties with the Jewish state, ultimately rejected the proposal, ostensibly because of the fear of possible nuclear retaliation by Pakistan and for fear of a possible backlash by Islamic states, including an oil embargo against it by the Muslim member-states of OPEC.\n\nIn 1991, India and Pakistan signed a treaty pledging that neither would preemptively attack the nuclear facilities of the other. However, as India’s and Pakistan’s animosity grows, this treaty has been rendered toothless and is unlikely to be adhered to by either side.\n\nIn the early 1990s, reports surfaced in London claiming Israel had repeatedly tried to pressure India into launching a joint strike on Pakistan''s nuclear weapons development plant at Kahuta. The reports claimed Israeli and Indian pilots would be aided by detailed satellite photographs of Kahuta provided by convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.\n\nAccording to a report in The Washington Times, citing US officials, Pakistan’s then Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed had notified the US government and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Israeli and Indian warplanes, equipped with long-range refueling gear and operating out of India, had planned to attack Pakistani nuclear facilities at dawn on Thursday, 28 May 1998.\n\nIt is possible that for Kahuta, the Israelis will use F-15 Strike Eagles to carry out the actual attack with F-16s providing air cover - a reversal of the roles in the operation against Osirak. Furthermore, it is almost certain that if Israel ever attempted to take out Pakistan’s nuclear weapons facilities, Kahuta will not be the only target and it is highly likely that the Plutonium Reactor at Khushab and the National Development Complex (NDC) at Fatehjung, among others, will be additional targets high on the priority list of the Israelis.\n\nSenior Israeli military intelligence officials had, of course, dismissed the notion that any kind of attack was being contemplated against Pakistan. Pakistan and India "are coming out of the closet and they are trying to drag us with them," one senior intelligence official said. "We have nothing to do with it. They are trying to force us into being a party in this. "The official also maintained that Pakistan''s infamous espionage and counter-espionage agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was acting on "faulty intelligence." The Israelis maintained that the misinformation may have been propaganda fed to them from some other body, the Iranians perhaps. "They took it seriously. They could have believed it, but they did the responsible thing and checked it out with the Americans," the official said. Not that the Americans could be trusted, given the fact that it was the United States which has supplied all the information and satellite photos of Pakistan''s nuclear installations to both Israel and India.\n\nThe assessment in Israel is that it does not believe that Pakistan sees the Jewish State as its enemy - not directly and at least not in the short-run. Israeli intelligence officials also do not believe that Pakistan has transferred nuclear or missile technology to nuclear-wannabe Iran. Moreover, they have no proof that Pakistan is or intends to engage in any nuclear cooperation with any other country. An Israeli defence analyst commented to this effect, "Pakistan will not transfer nuclear know-how to any other Muslim country, not out of fear of Israel, but because that would diminish its own importance in the Islamic World. Today, Pakistan is the Islamic world''s sole nuclear power, if there are two, Pakistan''s position would be reduced. So it is using its nuclear prowess not only as a deterrent against its enemies but also to bolster its relationship with its strategic friends".\n\nShai Feldman, Director of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel once stated, "I am certain that the Pakistanis have enough trouble on their hands and would refrain from doing something that would actually increase Israel''s incentive to cooperate with India. Why would they buy another enemy when the situation is as bad as it is?" Feldman said. "They are not stupid, and they probably know that if we had any evidence of transfer of technology to one of our adversaries then Israel would react and it wouldn''t be very pleasant," he added.\n\nAnd vice versa, Mr. Feldman.\n\nlink\n[url]http://www.grandestrategy.com/2009/03/wings-over-chagai-story-of-israels.html[/url]', ''),

(10211, ' Paul Harris in New York The Observer, Sunday 29 March 2009 Article history\n\nA mystery [b]electronic spy network apparently based in China[/b] has infiltrated hundreds of computers around the world and stolen files and documents, Canadian researchers have revealed.\n\nThe network, dubbed GhostNet, appears to target embassies, media groups, NGOs, international organisations, government foreign ministries and the offices of the Dalai Lama, leader of the Tibetan exile movement. The researchers, based at Toronto University''s Munk Centre for International Studies, said their discovery had profound implications.\n\n"This report serves as a wake-up call... these are major disruptive capabilities that the professional information security community, as well as policymakers, need to come to terms with rapidly," said researchers Ron Deibert and Rafal Rohozinski.\n\nAfter 10 months of study, the researchers concluded that GhostNet had invaded 1,295 computers in 103 countries, but it appeared to be most focused on countries in south Asia and south-east Asia, as well as the Dalai Lama''s offices in India, Brussels, London and New York. The network continues to infiltrate dozens of new computers each week.\n\nSuch a pattern, and the fact that the network seemed to be controlled from computers inside China, could suggest that GhostNet was set up or linked to Chinese government espionage agencies. However, the researchers were clear that they had not been able to identify who was behind the network, and said it could be run by private citizens in China or a different country altogether. A Chinese government spokesmen has denied any official involvement.\n\nGhostNet can invade a computer over the internet and penetrate and steal secret files. It can also turn on the cameras and microphones of an infected computer, effectively creating a bug that can monitor what is going inside the room where the computer is. Anyone could be watched and listened to.\n\nThe researchers said they had been tipped off to the network after having been asked by officials with the Dalai Lama to examine their computers. The officials had been worried that their computers were being infected and monitored by outsiders. The Chinese government regularly attacks the Tibetan exile movement as encouraging separatism and terrorism within China. The researchers found that the computers had succumbed to cyber-attack and that numerous files, including letters and emails, had been stolen. The intruders had also gained control of the electronic mail server of the Dalai Lama''s computers.\n\n"The investigation was able to conclude that Tibetan computer systems were compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive information, including documents from the private office of the Dalai Lama," the researchers concluded in their report. They have now notified various law enforcement agencies, including international groups and the FBI.\n\nThe news also comes as researchers at Cambridge University prepare to release a report today called Snooping Dragon, which looks at suspected Chinese cyber-monitoring of Tibetan exile groups. The report is expected to detail the unexpected scale and sophistication of such efforts by a government against a private body.\n\nlink\n[url]http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/29/china-computing[/url]', ''),

If the rope is thicker than the barrel dia it becomes difficult to insert in the barrel and if it is thinner than it does not clean the surface properly. \n\nAs PT''s are made of softer material you  can easily twist it to shrink in dia, insert in the barrel and let go of the other end. this makes it fit into the barrel snugly and clean evey bit of it.

He will visit various PAF bases and unfold his vision for the air force to meet challenges of the 21st century.\n\nSuleman said, "The cardinal points of my vision are integrity, professional excellence and teamwork. The air force is passing through a transit phase. We will be handling and operating old and new weapon systems of various capabilities, you are required to maintain these assets for their optimum performance. These systems will require knowledge-based training, thus my focus will be on modern training techniques and on flight safety. All measures and quality assurance procedures must be adopted for preserving these assets.”\n\nSurgical strikes: Referring to the Mumbai attacks, he lauded the PAF’s performance, saying it had played a vital role in averting an imminent war. "When the threat of surgical strikes was about to cross the threshold, I devised a strategy and within a few hours the PAF was ready to defend and launch offensive operations,” he added.\n\nSuleman told the airmen, "You are the cutting edge of the air force and the nation pins high hopes on you for defending, delivering and sacrificing, and keeping up the PAF traditions.” He emphasised on maintaining the highest level of standards for various aspects of air operations. online\n\n[url]http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C03%5C29%5Cstory_29-3-2009_pg7_33[/url]', ''),

The F100-PW-229 EEP represents the latest evolution in the F100 series of engines, recognized worldwide for its safety, reliability and cost Effective operation.\n\n\n\n“The F100-PW-229 EEP is another example of Pratt & Whitney’s pioneering work in fighter engine technology,” said Warren Boley, Vice President of Pratt & Whitney Military Programs and Customer Support. “Not only does it offer superior performance capabilities for our armed forces, it reduces maintenance and life cycle costs at a time when value and efficiency are top priorities on the nation’s agenda.”\n\n\n\nThe F100-PW-229 EEP incorporates groundbreaking technology developed for the F135 and F119 propulsion systems, the world’s only fifth-generation fighter jet engines. The F100-229 EEP will provide advanced, dependable power for F-16 and F-15 aircraft around the world. In response to strong customer demand, the first engines will begin delivery of the new configuration in October of this year.\n\n\n\nThe F100-PW-229 EEP was created to dramatically decrease the cost of ownership without impacting performance. This was accomplished by increasing the engine depot inspection interval from 4,300 to 6,000 cycles and increasing durability of key components while maintaining the 29,100 pound thrust rating. The inspection interval increase extends the amount of time between scheduled depot maintenance from the average of 7-9 years to over 10-14 years depending on utilization rates. This increase consequently should reduce life cycle costs by 30 percent over the life of the engine. The F100-PW-229 EEP continues to be the only fighter engine funded and qualified by the U.S. Air Force to the 6,000 cycle capability.\n\n\n\nPratt & Whitney will offer customers the option to purchase the F100-PW-229 EEP as a complete engine or as an upgrade kit that will be made available to all -229 operators near the end of 2010. “The U.S. Air Force and several other operators of the P&W F100-PW-229 engine have expressed interest in having upgrade kits to modify their existing engines, so we’re working diligently to provide this capability for our customers,” Boley said.\n\n\n\n\nInitially, 74 F100-PW-229 EEP engines have been ordered, with the first delivery set for Republic of Korea. Additional deliveries will be headed to Morocco and Pakistan in early 2010. Pratt & Whitney is a world leader in the design, manufacture and service of aircraft engines, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines. United Technologies, based in Hartford, Conn., is a diversified company providing high technology products and services to the global aerospace and commercial building industries.\n\n\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements concerning future business opportunities. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to changes in government procurement priorities and practices or in the number of aircraft to be built; challenges in the design, development, production and support of technologies; as well as other risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those detailed from time to time in United Technologies Corporation''s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/03/pratt-whitney-begins-production-of-next.html[/url]', ''),

Her name, an Arabic Word meaning ‘Help’ denotes its combat support role so very vital for sustained operations at sea.\n\nThe ship is capable of providing fuel, water and stores to surface ships and helicopters at sea for prolonged perations and therefore acts as a lifeline of the Fleet.\n\nPNS NASR actively participated in LIMA-07 held at Langkawi Malaysia in December 2007. The ship contributed in Tsunami Relief Operations at Maldives and provided assistance to ‘Sidr’ cyclone effectees in Bangladesh.\n\nPNS BADR is a leading war ship of the 25th Destroyer Squadron of Pakistan Fleet. The ship is named after the famous battle fought in 624 AD at a place called BADR near Madinah. The ship is fitted with state of the art weapons and sensors manned by highly trained and motivated team.\n\n\n[url]http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=71864[/url]', ''),

We''re sending ships to Somali and we''re planning that very shortly," the defence minister said.\n\nHe said that the pirates were hijacking fuel-carrying vessels now and they might hijack any others.\n\n"I think the challenges are basically from the pirates. The countries which are doing this exercise get together and relieve the people they are trying to hijack," he added.\n\nSome 20 warships and 19 aircraft participated Wednesday''s fleet review.\n\nTogether with Mukhtar at the fleet review are Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Noman Bashir, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Tariq Majid and other distinguished guests from countries which are either participants or observers to the AMAN 09 exercise.\n\nThis is the second exercise in the AMAN series. The slogan of the exercise is "Together for Peace".\n\nThe first series of AMAN exercises were held in March 2007 when14 ships belonging to Bangladesh, China, France, Italy, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States navies took part.\n\n[url]http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/11/content_10994491.htm[/url]', ''),

I asked Smith & Wesson People about\n\nthe same and the answer was logical. This pistol was specially produced as part of an American Support Contract with \n\nAfghan Govt by Smith & Wesson. Smith & Wesson was then advised by CIA that the afghans are born " Trigger Happy"\n\nso they had to increase the trigger pull to stop them fro wasting ammo.\n\nThe other sigma models have a normal 5 pound trigger pull .\n\nThe pistol   is very accurate .... 4" group from 15 metere is like good.

(381136, ' @Mig and Trajan\nThis is a very serious and potentially dangerous situation. Personally I wouldn''t stop at all, and would instead accelerate and smash right into them (hopefully running over one of the buggers!). I would continue driving fast, while simultaneously pulling my gun out and switching the safety off (provided you carry with a round already chambered).\nPersonally, I''m a big proponent of the 3 Rules I mentioned in my previous post. Let me do a hypothetical rundown of the situation Mig described: I''m driving and talking on the phone at the same time (something which should be avoided at all times because it seriously hampers your "Situational Awareness" and ability to make snap decisions. If necessary, carry a hands-free for your phone), when suddenly 2 bikes stop in front of me. Not knowing what the intentions of the perpetrators are, I''ll assume the worst (that they''re here to kill me) and will immediately go to Condition Red. I''ll immediately floor the accelerator and ram the bikes (ideally at the spot between the 2 bikes which will topple both the bikes and discourage/delay the perps from following you). As I speed away, I''ll also pull out my gun and switch off the safety. Also, I''ll call the police and immediately inform them of the situation. I will [B]NOT[/B], however, get into a gunfight because my first priority is extracting myself ASAP, unharmed and intact.\nNow I know that this is a hypothetical debate, but it''s always best to have some kind of plan laid out in your head. The old saying "Even the best laid plans do not survive the first contact with the enemy" is true, and given the heightened emotional state you''ll be in, you might not follow your plan through exactly. But as long as you have SOME course of action planned out, you''ll atleast execute some part of your plan.\nTwo very important things to remember: First, always be prepared for the worst. Second, a bad decision is always better than no decision at all.\nJust my 2 cents.', ''),

The aim was to improve the bullet''s effectiveness by increasing its expansion upon impact.\n\nThe phrase ''dum-dum'' was later taken to include any soft-nosed or hollow pointed bullet.  The Hague Convention of 1899 outlawed the use of dum-dum bullets during warfare.\n\n[u]Source:[url]http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/dumdum.htm[/url][/u]\n\nSuch bullets are sometimes known as Dum-dum or dumdum bullets, after an early British example produced in the Dum Dum arsenal, near Calcutta, India. There were several expanding bullets produced by this arsenal for the .303 British cartridge, including soft point and hollow point designs. These were not the first expanding bullets, however; hollow point expanding bullets were commonly used for hunting thin skinned game in express rifles as early as the mid 1870s.[1]. The use of the term "Dum-dum", applied to expanding bullets other than the early .303 designs, is considered slang.[2] Manufacturers have many terms to describe the particular construction of the various types of expanding bullets, though most fall into the category of soft point or hollow point designs.\n\n[u]Source:[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dum-dum[/url][/u]', ''),
(11108, ' Hi All\n\nSalams !\n\nThanx for the comments. If anyone wants to make a modification to the Gun.... well you can to get rid of the painful trigger  pull. The Trigger spring can be simply replaced with a Glock 19 ..very simple to do....but you see it is still a mistery to me that \nthe gun will loose its accuracy a bit. This is a fact that after Browning high power and S&W M&P pistols I have found it pretty\naccurate. Take this from me after 2-3 years you wont be able to find one for 200 K. 4 containers containing these pistols were plundered in the tribal areas ..thats why we have these good guns so cheap. The reason for the accuracy of the weapon is in its barrel. The barrel is cold metal forged and is quite thick...more then the glocks...thats why you have such great accuracy... the spin imparted on the round is also more then normal ..if you see the hole in targets made by rounds of these pistols you will find them very sharp and fine....this is what rounds with greater spin and less lateral wobble do...\n\ndont sell any if you have these goodies\n\nRegards\nBlood Bath\nThe gun is a definate keep .....shoot it and you will start engoying it....', ''),

Its reputation for reliability and accuracy is no less impressive than that of its bigger brother, the P228 design being a favourite of military operatives and law enforcement professionals. It is issued to U.S. government agents (ATF, Secret Service, CID, DSS, etc.) among others. Now, thanks to North China Industries, this premier auto pistol is now available for a fraction of the cost of its European made counterpart!

Your only resort is to go to a dealer authorized to deal in PB firearms who''s likely to fleece you. \n\nThe only option for the common man whos somehow got hold of a PB license is to get it from the Govenment Nazarat. Retail price for an Ak47 is PKR 16,000. BUT you''ll have to do serious string pulling (well atleast in Sindh) to get the Interior Minister to authorize you purchase from the Nazarat. Your ordeal does not end here because again you''ll have to make phone calls for the Nazarat people to get you good firearms since 99.9% weapons that are there are either local made or seriously defected. \n\nThere is a practice of buying a defected weapon from there and getting its serial number stamped on the weapon that you''ll buy from the black market but again the practice is illegal and the tampering can easily be caught by the forensic department if/when there is an investigation of any kind against your weapon.\n\nI think the recent registration of PB firearms by some political agents in NWFP is probably the Malik Gift Scheme (I''m not sure if this practice is MGF). The registartion costs you 10-15k  to get it registered plus the cost of your weapon and you have your chic with a switch throwing up molten lead.', ''),

(11422, ' [b] Ntanyahu To Obama: Stop Iran Or I Will!, here comes the pain![/b]\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Atlantic''s Jeffrey Goldberg Tuesday, just before he was sworn in as Israel''s new prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu issued a bold statement: if Obama does not stop Iran''s nuclear program, Israel most certainly will. The assertion seems to confirm Netanyahu''s own hawkishness, as well as the fears of US Middle East policymakers who support a more delicate approach to the region. From the interview account:\n\nIn an interview conducted shortly before he was sworn in today as prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu laid down a challenge for Barack Obama. The American president, he said, must stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons--and quickly--or an imperiled Israel may be forced to attack Iran''s nuclear facilities itself.\n\n\n"The Obama presidency has two great missions: fixing the economy, and preventing Iran from gaining nuclear weapons," Netanyahu told me. He said the Iranian nuclear challenge represents a "hinge of history" and added that "Western civilization" will have failed if Iran is allowed to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nIn unusually blunt language, Netanyahu said of the Iranian leadership, "You don''t want a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs. When the wide-eyed believer gets hold of the reins of power and the weapons of mass death, then the entire world should start worrying, and that is what is happening in Iran."\n\nHowever, further in Goldberg''s account of the interview comes more promising signs that Netanyahu, despite blunt statements, still reserves room for non-military, diplomatic measures to stymie Iranian nuclear development:\n\nNetanyahu said he would support President Obama''s decision to engage Iran, so long as negotiations brought about a quick end to Iran''s nuclear ambitions. "How you achieve this goal is less important than achieving it," he said, but he added that he was skeptical that Iran would respond positively to Obama''s appeals. In an hour-long conversation, held in the Knesset, Netanyahu tempered his aggressive rhetoric with an acknowledgement that nonmilitary pressure could yet work. "I think the Iranian economy is very weak, which makes Iran susceptible to sanctions that can be ratcheted up by a variety of means." When I suggested that this statement contradicted his assertion that Iran, by its fanatic nature, is immune to pressure, Netanyahu smiled thinly and said, "Iran is a composite leadership, but in that composite leadership there are elements of wide-eyed fanaticism that do not exist right now in any other would-be nuclear power in the world. That''s what makes them so dangerous."\n\n[url]http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/31/netanyahu-to-obama-stop-i_n_181293.html[/url]\n\n[b]Dang! Talk about having a nerve.

(11423, ' [b]Pakistan May Seek Chinese Interceptor[/b]\n\nPakistan may seek help from Beijing for high-altitude and anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses, defense observers say. “Pakistan is actively looking to purchase a high-altitude missile air defense system,” said defense analyst Haris Khan of the Pakistan Military Consortium. “Reports indicate that the Chinese HQ-9/FD2000 developed by the China Academy of Defence Technology is the front-runner, but I think it is the only candidate, since no other supplier will sell these types of missiles to Pakistan.” But other observers here noted obstacles, including defense budget cuts and a rough patch in relations between the two governments.\n\n\nThe HQ-9 reportedly blends technology from Chinese efforts, Russian S-300s and an early version of the U.S. Patriot system obtained from Israel. Chinese sources say it can hit aircraft out to 125 kilometers, air-launched cruise missiles out to 50 kilometers, and ballistic missiles out to 25 kilometers — representing ABM capability equivalent to the Indian AAD and American PAC-3.\n\n\nThere has been speculation that Pakistan acquired an HQ-9 variant called the FT-2000 some years ago as a short-term countermeasure against India’s airborne early warning and control aircraft, but no such missile has been seen in the country, and some sources say the FT-2000 was never actually produced.\n\n“China has always fulfilled its promise to meet Pakistan’s defense needs”Akhtar said. He noted that China needs Pakistan as a bulwark against Indian hegemony in southern Asia, and said the “all-weather, strategic Sino-Pak relationship had moved beyond a purely defense relationship” to a “deep economic relationship.” Akhtar also dismissed concerns about budget cuts, saying that the enduring Sino-Pak relationship makes him “optimistic that this would not affect Pakistan’s defensive capabilities in the long run.” But Shireen Mazari, a former head of the Institute of Strategic Studies, has written that the government’s Strategic Planning Division, which controls the planning and deployment of strategic weapons, had cut research and development funding in high-technology areas.\n\nKhan agreed. “The SPD’s funds have been curtailed,” especially for newer projects, he said. Strategic Planning Division officials have rejected these statements. Khan also said the SPD and the National Engineering and Scientific Commission, which handles the design and production of ballistic missiles and other defense programs, had been instructed to slow work on certain projects. “In the short to medium term, there might not be any effects, but in the long term, these reductions will cause fault lines which Pakistan cannot afford,” Khan said. How these political and financial developments will affect a potential HQ-9 deal is unclear. “The Pakistan government has an eye on these Indian ambitions, and would definitely have to counter the threat,”', ''),

Steel pellets damaging a barrel applies to those guns that are NOT steel pellet compliant. The modern guns that can handle steel shots do have chokes capable to handle the job simultaneously.\n\nSteel shots are lighter, harder & more uniform in shape therefore have shorter effective range in terms of energy per pellet but more uniform pattern. On the other hand, lead pallets are heavier and softer therefore tend to deform while leaving barrel. These pellets have more penetration power although less uniform pattern compared to steel ones.', ''),

All the pics were taken in a way to show least blood.  \nOmer[/quote]\nThanx dear Omer for that update. I did observe the cuts at the base of the neck i.e. usually done for trophy mounting purpose. What I have seen, ''zibah'' is administered @ throat around Larynx.\n\nThis forum is a guiding tool as well for the learners. The reason of asking questions is in no way criticism of any kind, its clarification of any possible doubts. Taking this opportunity, I would like to put it down here in this post.\n\nSlaughtering is to be done from the front of the neck, between the throat and the head of the breast bone (Libba). The throat/oesophagus (Mirree), windpipe/trachea (Halkoom) and the two jugular veins (Wadijan) are cut in the neck without severing the spinal cord. This cut severes the arteries to the brain of the animal, thus depriving the brain of blood supply. As a result, the brain loses consciousness due to insufficient oxygen. This renders the animal unconscious, causing the animal the least amount of pain. \n\nThe Muslim slaughterer who carries out Zibah (Islamic method of slaughter) cuts the two jugular veins, which carry blood from the brain to the heart, and the two carotid arteries, which transport blood from the heart to the brain. This leads to blood drainage instantaneously which ultimately results in a sudden dip in blood pressure. Meanwhile, messages are still being transmitted from the brain to the heart to pump more blood to the brain. This phenomenon causes more blood to gush out of the cut region. In addition, natural responses from the pulse, respiration, and blood ejaculation by muscular contraction and movements of the limbs further result in a more thorough bleeding.', ''),

Small hands often require smaller grip sizes, and vice versa.\n3. What is the situation in which the shooter might be using the gun?

Both desert eagle and smith and wesson .500 are rifle calibres necked down into a handgun (to the best of my knowledge).

(12242, ' [b]India should have nuclear attack submarines: France[/b]\n\nFrance on Friday gave its backing to India developing a nuclear attack submarine fleet, with a senior naval officer saying it was a "legitimate" step as the country emerges as a major global force. The commander of the French Joint Forces in the Indian Ocean, Vice Admiral Gerard Valin, said India''s military assets had to develop to reflect its position as a key world player, including in maintaining world stability. Asked if that meant having nuclear attack submarines, he told reporters in Mumbai: "For me it''s legitimate."\n\n"A nuclear-propelled submarine gives you mobility. France has a nuclear deterrent. To have a nuclear deterrent you must have submarines capable of ensuring the security of a large area," he added. "I think that India will be in the same situation" in the future, he said. India''s naval chief said in 2007 that the country''s first domestically built nuclear-powered submarine would be ready for sea trials by this year. The vessel is expected to be an adaptation of the Russian Charlie II class submarine and capable of firing nuclear warheads.\n\nSince then, India has test-fired nuclear-capable ballistic missiles from undersea platforms as part of an ongoing programme to develop land and sea-borne nuclear and conventional missile systems. France and India have been steadily developing military ties. Last week the Indian and French navies took part in anti-submarine exercises off the coast of the western state of Goa, said Valin. India''s navy is also involved in the international effort to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa. Part of Valin''s mandate is marine law enforcement, including targeting high seas hijacks by armed bandits in the same area.\n\n\nIn October 2005 India signed contracts worth 2.4 billion euros (3.8 billion dollars) with Armaris, which is owned by France''s Thales, and European defence firm MBDA to buy six Scorpene submarines. They are being assembled in India and are slated to begin operations from 2015.\nFrench companies are also looking to make inroads into India''s civilian atomic energy market, following the lifting last year of an embargo on nuclear deals with India imposed in 1974 after New Delhi staged nuclear tests.\n\nlink\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/04/india-should-have-nuclear-attack.html[/url]', ''),

(12245, ' [b]Indian Army fears China attack by 2017[/b]\n\n* Secret military exercise visualises war scenario in less than a decade\n* Top brass brainstorm over India’s options in case Pakistan joins war\n\nLAHORE: The Indian military fears a ‘Chinese aggression’ in less than a decade, the Hindustan Times has reported, and claimed that a secret exercise – called ‘Divine Matrix’ – by the army’s military operations directorate has visualised a war scenario with the nuclear-armed neighbour before 2017.\n\n“A misadventure by China is very much within the realm of possibility with Beijing trying to position itself as the only power in the region. There will be no nuclear warfare but a short, swift war that could have menacing consequences for India,” said an army officer, who was part of the three-day war games that ended on Wednesday. In the military’s assessment, based on a six-month study of various scenarios before the war games, “China would rely on information warfare (IW) to bring India down on its knees before launching an offensive”, the report claimed.\n\nThe war games saw generals raising concerns about the IW battalions of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) carrying out hacker attacks for military espionage, intelligence collection, paralysing communication systems, compromising airport security, inflicting damage on the banking system and disabling power grids. “We need to spend more on developing information warfare capability,” he said. The war games dispelled the notion that China would take at least one year for a substantial military build-up across India’s northeastern frontiers. “The Tibetan infrastructure has been improved considerably. “The PLA can now launch an assault very quickly, without any warning,” said the officer.\n\n“The military believes that China would have swamped Tibet with sweeping demographic changes in the medium term. For the purposes of Divine Matrix, China would call Dalai Lama for rapprochement and neutralise him. The top brass also brainstormed over India’s options in case Pakistan joined the war too. Another apprehension was that Myanmar and Bangladesh would align with China in the future geo-strategic environment,” said the Hindustan Times. daily times monitor\n\n[url]http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\\03\\27\\story_27-3-2009_pg7_45[/url]', ''),

He said this was the maiden visit for ''Badr'' in Malaysia, while ''Nasr'' had been sailing here regularly, especially to provide support for Pakistan naval ships which participated in LIMA, the bi-annual military showcase in Langkawi.Kamran described the ties between the two naval forces as good, adding that last March, they were involved in a joint naval exercise, ''AMAN'', in Pakistan where the Malaysian Navy sent ''KD Kedah'' and its crew to participate. He said Pakistan would like to study the possibility of placing its female naval personnel on board warships like what was being done in the Malaysian Navy.Currently, Pakistan Navy female personnel were working in the information technology, medical and education sectors of the navy.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/04/two-pakistan-naval-ships-dock-in-port.html[/url]', ''),

A 7mm Rem Mag will give you a less bullet drop (better trajectory) when shooting at 400-500 yards since it''s ballistically superior to the .270.\n\n.270 bullets are cheaper than 7mm Rem Mag but it wouldnt matter since you wont be using 100 bullets a weak.\n\nSummary: If your planning on hunting within 300-400 yards I would recommend .270. If 400+ yards which Im sketical you will, go for a 7mm Rem Mag. Some times you just dont want the bullet to do those extra yards.', ''),

(12314, ' Kidnappings are on the rise in NWFP & upper punjab. If you think you might be a catch pls take the following precautions:\n\n1. Avoid commuting in expensive cars & SUVs.\n2. If you own an expensive cell phone use a handsfree to talk on it in public. You accessories(watch, cellphone etc.) gives out a lot about what you are.\n3. There mostly an insider involved so be wary of giving out personal information like office timings, working hours, places you go to at a given time & on a given day, your financial standing, your profits, quoting prices of items of interest in your pocession and the like. Only provide information on a need to know basis. For the brevity of it: Keep you eyes open & you mouth shut.\n4. If your work requires visiting a bank on a regular basis, make good terms with the manager and handle all transactions from his room. Do not take cash at cash counters. Keep changing the times & days that you visit a bank.\n5. Be unpreditable in every action. Do not keep fixed timings & use same routes. Art of war is based upon deception.\n6. If you have an enemity, most cultures in our region will not attack you if you have a third person with you. They wouldnt want another enemity if they hurt another person. Always keep a friend with you when you go out.\n7. Keep a weapon. Always. And when you do and you travel alone mostly never let anyone know under any circumstances that you own one. Detente doesnnt apply to kidnapping for ransom when your travelling or commuting without a personal security detail. If they want to kidnap you they will kidnap you and if they know you might be armed their primary objective would be to get you unarmed by all means which is likely to turn voilent. \n8. Most kidnappings in upper punjab takes place on the highways & motor ways. Keep your eyes on the view mirrors. Keep a good safe distance from all approaching vehicles. Kidnappers usually use two vehicles and try to squeeze you into stopping from front & rear. Almost all of them use 95-98 model Toyota Corrollas. If you see two speeding cars approaching your vehicle and the instant they''re near you, change the lane and slow down and let them pass. They''ll panic and will blow their intention and you''ll have a cushion and space to get out. If you have a weapon, I would prefer a machine pistol at that time or a handy pump action, FIRE at them & get away. 99% of them will not come after you. SHOTGUNS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS IN CLOSE QUARTER ENGAGEMENTS. Learn how to load ammo with one hand esp when driving.\n9. Do not go to collect cash payments.\n10. Do not meet unknown people. I was lured and invited to a business deal in Bahawalpur and was kidnapped.\n11. NEVER accept drinks & food at a strange place by strange people. Keep a LIVE chambered rounds when you anticipate things to escalate.\n12. If confronted with a situation, be offensive VERY offensive & ruthless but retreat IMMEDIATELY when they dont expect you to. Shock & Awe.\n13. Your children & family members are the kidnappers primary target. Your drivers & servants are usually the primary sources of information. Always drop & pickup your children from the school. The timings would be fixed so keep changing the routes. Make sure your children know home addresses & your telephone numbers and of your friends  family. Make sure your children know the way to home. They should know how to hire a taxi or riskshaw. Do drills with them for different kind of situations. IMPORTANT: Your servants should be SHIT scared of you. So scared that they''d wet their clothes. This again works for a repellent. Have copies of their ID cards. Home addresses. Addresses of their close relatives, every one of them. Know the ISDN number of the mobile phone sets that they use. Never trust anyone. Keep them well paid and have them trust & love you as well. Dont talk about financial matters in their presence. Do not make cash transactions in their presence and let them have an approximation of your net worth.\n14. If you think you are eligible enough to be kidnapped, you can afford a personal security detail as well. Try not to hire personnel from security companies. They CANNOT be trusted. With all due respect, esp the tribals because they are unpredictable. Never let two guards have good relations or friendly terms with the other. Always make sure theyre against the other. This can be accomplished by keeping guards from different ethnicities esp ethnicities which are at loggerheads with the other. Pair them up if they have different political idealogies. You know inside out. Never hire two guards from the same security company. Keep changing them regularly. \n15. Never let you kid trust your servants of security guards. Tell your kids to panic & start shouting once they see an unusualy situation or an unusual route.\n\nNever ever neglect or takes things easy or give any one an opportunity against you. Always be prepared.', ''),

What I learnt from these elders experience was to either keep low walls and gate installed at your place or High Walls with Shut out gates if you prefer to keep a couple of armed guards inside. \n\nI have been living in a house with Low walls and open gate since the beginning. you would be surprised to note that leave alone 2 incidences of robberies by the servants Alhamd o Lillah we never had any incidence. By the wa I live in a busy Society area of Karachi and own a couple of weapons,which by the grace of Allah were never used on intruders. \n\nThe theory given by the elders on low walls is that these robbers/gangsters never try to enter a place which can be seen clearly from outside. This makes them vulnerable. I think they also keep their security in mind!\n\n[quote=Abbas]About half an hour ago two men walked into my next door neighbors house and put a gun to their old guard''s head. They were pressuring him to get the main door opened from inside when the old man started shouting my servants names with cries of help. They heard and looked over the wall to see this scene, as soon as they saw that they had been discovered they ran. Two young guys wearing jeans etc on a white car with a third waiting in the car. I missed the scene by minutes as my library over looks that exact spot in their house. \n\nThe law and order situation is getting out of hand. Perhaps my house was avoided because of shotgun carrying guards but this is still insane. Openly breaking in at 12:30 in the afternoon! We need to protect our homes against these sort of people. The reason for starting this thread is to start a discussion on home defense and suggestions and costs involved for things like barbed wire, alarm systems etc.\n\n[b]Please do not start bashing Police or turn this into a political discussion.

Experts from different countries shared their findings on drawbacks and benefits of 7.62x51, 5.56x45, 6.5, 7.62x39 and .50bmg. All of them unanimously agreed that 5.56x45 is under powered, has  very high crippled shots than fatal hits and the only benefit was its portability factor. Where as 7.62x39 has more one shot kills and is much more potent and yet light enough to carry 300rd per soldier. The round which came on the top was 7.62x51 due to its hard hitting capabilities and being very effective and accurate at engaging targets from close to long range.\n\nThe prices on 7.62x39 and 7.62x51 are pretty high here in US now, I use to pay less than $150 for a sealed can of 1000 rounds of 7.62x39 and less than $200 for 7.62x51 NATO (1000 rounds) up until 2007. \nBought 4, 1000rd cans of 7.62x51 NATO bullets in January of this year and paid $556.00 per can.

Before I was a firearms fanatic I used to collect dogs specially pitbulls.\n\nA pure pitbull is expected to be friendly. An aggressive dog is usually a strain or a result of bad breeding. The primary purpose of an efficient guard dog is to make as much noise as possible to alert it''s owners of the intrusion and only attack if/when the intruder doesnt retreat. Even their attack creates quite a racket. Pitbulls (if aggressive) or Rottweilers are likely to cling on to the intruder without making much noise and are likely to be killed if the intruder knows how to handle dogs.\n\nThe best guard dog for be a German Shepherd or a Doberman. \n\nI''d rather keep a friendly German Shepherd & an aggressive Rott.

(12561, ' Abbas: Excellent thread.  Prevention is only one aspect of security.  I agree that a good perimeter, with high walls and barbed wire/broken glass, hidden cameras and dogs is the best defensive approach and having alarms (canine and electric) will give you a chance to prepare a course of action.\n\nBut as virtually all of us have firearms at home legally, what should that course of action be? \n\nAlso where do we, as residents stand as far as the law goes?  In the US there is a "Castle Doctrine" which pretty much gives you indemnity if someone invades your property and you shoot them, do the laws of Pakistan also apply in a similar manner?\n\nAlso, being a good neighbor has been suggested in this thread.  What exactly is meant by that?  If your neighbor is being robbed/invaded and you hear or are aware, would you or rather CAN you go to his help (after calling 15) with your weapon?  (Please note that I am NOT suggesting James Bond style commando action!!!)\n\nIn your specific case, had you been there to see from your library at the time, could you have taken a shot at them from your house with a rifle?  Or fired in the air to frighten them?  If your guards had been outside and they saw this happen, could they have fired upon the perpetrators or on their car?  \n\nWhere do we stand vis a vis the law in that case?  \n\nI think that we need to know what our rights are as well as well as procedures as to how to handle the situation once it has been defused (with or without firearm discharge).', ''),

(12704, ' [b] China Adds Precision Strike To Capabilities[/b]\n\nChina has been developing and purchasing weapons for precision-strike warfare. This is the hard edge of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) doctrinal drive toward using increasingly sophisticated information technologies such as C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) to improve the capabilities of weapon systems (DTI March, p. 39). The PLA’s near-term goals appear to be greater asymmetric capabilities to target U.S. naval assets in the western Pacific and in space as part of an anti-access strategy. Long-term, however, greater precision will be a feature of most new weapon systems.\n\nChina’s growing C4ISR capabilities were demonstrated in March by its coordinated two-fleet operation to intercept two U.S. Navy ocean survey vessels. Chinese ships found and harassed the USNS Victorious, operating in the Yellow Sea, and USNS Impeccable, which was about 75 mi. south of Hainan Island. The fallout was diplomatic, as Washington and Beijing clashed over interpretations of the Law of the Sea Treaty, which Beijing contends gives it rights to deny access to military survey missions. This incident, though, was reminiscent in timing and scope to the April 2001 clash that saw China “capture” a U.S. Navy EP-3 electronic intelligence aircraft off Hainan.\n\nChina’s aggressive challenge of Japanese claims in the East China Sea, plus Washington’s refusal to cease its survey missions could be flashpoints. In February, a provincial Communist Party newspaper contained a threat to sink U.S. survey ships.\n\nIn this second of three articles on China’s growing regional power, DTI examines the country’s efforts to improve its ability to target and destroy threats.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Chinese military scholars have been warning of the need for China to prepare to defend against, and if necessary, conduct military operations in space. In late 2006 reports emerged of China’s use of high-power ground-based lasers to “dazzle” U.S. surveillance satellites. On Feb. 11, 2007, China launched the first successful intercept by its SC-19 direct-ascent antisatellite (ASAT) system, derived from its KT-1 solid-fuel space-launch vehicle, with an interceptor stage whose development was likely aided by China’s micro-satellite programs. A target FY-2 weather satellite was probably illuminated by large phased-array radar developed for tracking Shenzhou manned space capsules. A far less-noted potential co-orbital ASAT demonstration occurred on Sept. 27, 2008, when the Shenzhou-7 manned spacecraft, which had just launched a BX-1 nanosatellite, passed within 45 km. (28 mi.) of the International Space Station. Following the U.S. Navy’s shootdown of an errant satellite on Feb. 21, 2008, and a Mar. 5, 2008, announcement that Russia would resume ASAT development, it is likely that China will continue ASAT testing.\n\nChina’s direct-ascent ASAT also proves that it is capable of developing a long-range antiballistic missile (ABM) system, a U.S. pursuit that China has opposed. China had an ABM program from 1963-80 that produced a short-range interceptor prototype and long-range radar. Chinese sources told DTI at the recent IDEX expo in Abu Dhabi (see p. 16) that they have tested the new FD-2000 surface-to-air missile (SAM) in an antitactical ballistic missile (ATBM) mode. Developed with help from Russia’s Almaz-Antey Co., the FD-2000 also draws from the earlier passive-guided FT-2000 SAM, which reportedly benefited from U.S. Patriot SAM technology. These indigenous SAMs are entering PLA service, and will complement about 1,000 Almaz-Antey S-300/PMU-1/PMU-2 SAMs purchased since the early 1990s, giving the PLA air force the most formidable air-defense network in Asia. The PLA has also developed short-range SAM systems—including man-portable air-defense systems—for tracked vehicles and trucks. Among these is the TY-90 Yitian for trucks and armored personnel carriers that was disclosed in 2005, but displayed for the first time at IDEX this year.\n\nIncreasing precision is also the hallmark of new PLA surface-to-surface missiles and air-launched weapons. New Chinese nuclear ballistic missile warheads feature smaller sharp-tip warheads, signifying higher precision. One warhead configuration for the 12,000-km.-range DF-31A ICBM places at least one warhead on a delivery bus that is apparently capable of radical maneuvering to evade ABM defenses.\n\nMedium- and short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) are also being upgraded for greater precision. The U.S. and Japanese navies have long been concerned with the PLA program to create an antiship ballistic missile, by placing a maneuverable terminally guided warhead on the 2,400-km.-range DF-21, and likely, on the 600-km. DF-15. Asian military sources are also concerned that a new 3,000-km. version of the DF-21 may have multiple terminally guided warheads.\n\nAn early 2009 Taiwanese estimate places the DF?15, DF-11 Mod2 and new land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs) of the second artillery missile force targeting Taiwan at more than 1,500, with newer versions having navigation satellite (navsat) guidance. In 2007 a Chinese source told DTI that the PLA will also be using two new shorter-range SRBMs, the truck-mounted 250-km. B-611M and 150-km. air-transportable P-12. Both are maneuverable, navsat-guided weapons with modular warheads. The PLA is also developing longer-range artillery rocket-based SRBMs, like the 200-km. navsat-guided WS-3. Some Chinese sources indicate that an antiradar or passive-guided 300-km. version of the WS series is possible.\n\nAsian sources say the PLA has developed two families of strategic-range LACMs: the DH-10, which equips new units of the Second Artillery, and YJ-62/C-602, which equips PLA navy destroyers and land-based antiship missile units, and is to be developed into an air-launched version for the PLA air force. The air force is expected to equip a new version of the 1950s-era Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 Badger bomber, the Xian H-6K, with the weapon. The H-6Ks modified with more powerful engines, now have a potential 3,000-km. radius—enough to reach Guam. Rumors have long surrounded a potential long-range bomber program at Xian Aircraft Co., and a new stealthy version of Xian’s JH-7A fighter bomber is also in development.\n\nTactical combat aircraft in the PLA air force and navy are receiving new Russian and indigenously designed air-to-air and ground-attack weapons. The air force’s first Sukhoi Su-27SK fighters had the helmet-sighted Vympel R-73 missile a decade before the Raytheon AIM-9X entered U.S. service. The BVR self-guided Vympel R-77 followed the Su-30MKK into PLA service early this decade. But new Chengdu Aircraft Corp. J-10 and Shenyang Aircraft Corp. J-11B multirole fighters will carry air-to-air missiles designed by Luoyang Opto-Electric Co. (LOEC), which include the self-guided PL-12, thought to have a range approaching 100 km. in lofted delivery. Chinese sources also indicate LOEC is developing a high off-boresight air-to-air missile (AAM) similar to the South African Denel A-Darter, and a long-range ramjet-powered AAM.\n\nRussian Su-30s in PLA service have been equipped with several guided munitions, including the Zvezda Kh-31 antiradar and antiship ramjet missile, Zvezda Kh-59 interdiction missile and optical image-correlation-guided KAB series bombs. At the 2005 Moscow air show, a Russian source disclosed that Russia had assisted China’s development of electro-optical targeting pods, which have been photographed on J-10, JH-7A and some Hongdu Q-5 fighter-bombers. These will help guide two new families of laser- and navsat-guided bombs developed by LOEC and China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC). The latter’s FT family includes the 500-kg. (1,100-lb.) FT-1 navsat-guided bomb, the FT-2, which adds range-extending wings, the 250-kg. FT-3 and the 100-kg. FT-5, which is reportedly comparable with Boeing’s Small Diameter Bomb. At last November’s Zhuhai air show, LOEC revealed a dual-optical navsat-guided bomb. CASC’s bombs can be expected to follow suit.\n\nPrecision is being packed into smaller munitions like the new 45-kg. AR-1, a laser-guided missile designed for the CH-3 unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), similar in capability to the U.S. Predator-1. Guizhou Aircraft Co. has likely developed a larger turbofan UCAV comparable to the MQ-9 Predator-B/Reaper.\n\nMost of China’s new precision-strike systems are for sale. Pakistan and Iran have benefited from China’s ballistic and cruise missile technology, and from sales of conventional systems. Many more countries are likely to consider the $22-million Chengdu FC-1 and $41-million J-10 fighters, especially when equipped with precision-guided munitions like the PL-12 and FT-1. This form of power projection will soon be joined by the PLA’s increasing power-projection capabilities, the subject of the final installment.\n\n[url]http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&id=news/CHINA040809.xml&headline=China%20adds%20precision%20strike%20to%20capabilities[/url]', ''),

Pakistan is the eighth international customer to join the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard flying with Sniper ATP. The contract includes spares and training services. Terms of the contract were not disclosed. “This sale culminates a two year combined effort by Lockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control and Aeronautics businesses to upgrade the precision attack capability of one of our key allies,” said Ken Fuhr, director of Fixed Wing Targeting Programs at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. “Sniper continues to demonstrate exceptional performance in meeting the requirements and expectations of the Warfighter.” With deliveries [having begun] in 2008, the Pakistan Air Force will benefit from Sniper ATP’s exceptional stability and superior imagery, allowing aircrews to perform intelligence, targeting, surveillance and reconnaissance missions from extended standoff ranges. The Pakistan Air Force joins the U.K. Ministry of Defence; the Canadian Forces, the Royal Norwegian Air Force; the Polish Air and Air Defense Force; the Royal Air Force of Oman; the Belgium Defence; and other international customers with its selection of the Sniper ATP. Sniper ATP is currently flying on the U.S. Air Force and multinational F-15s, F-16s, F-18s, A-10s, B-1s and the Harrier GR9. Sniper ATPs have accumulated tens of thousands of flight hours in thousands of sorties in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.Sniper incorporates a high-resolution, mid-wave third-generation forward-looking infrared (FLIR), a dual-mode laser permitting eye-safe operation in urban environments, a CCD-TV along with a laser spot tracker and a laser marker. Sniper is fully compatible with the latest J-series munitions and precision-guided weaponry. Its superior detection ranges are vital to pilots, helping keep them out of range of threat air defenses. Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin employs about 140,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/04/paf-selects-lockheed-martin-sniper.html[/url]', ''),

(12744, ' I have used both extensively. I dont mind using either in a SD/HD situation. 5.56 is offered in a variety of firearms whereas x39 is just AK for the most part.

Then thats just the design not the ammo. 5.56 is much smoother to shot than x39, but x39 has more impact on the target- how much more? Not enough for me to give up 5.56''s advantages in range.

(12764, ' Lots of POF and Indian made ammo in 7.62x51 and 9mm is floating around here in US, it is cheapest of all and has bad reputation among general users.Heavy fouling, bad smell and high rate of duds are the common complaints. I personally have no experience with it so can''t say much. Now a days 7.62x51 Nato has the highest demand and is getting very scarce but still no body is buying POF and Indian stuff which is still available at reasonably low price. Its non corrosive.\n\nIf any of you end up with corrosive ammo, just ensure that after you are done shooting, spray your gun barrel and chamber area with mixture of water and ammonia ( windex or ammonia based glass and window cleaner is best) until you reach back home, then properly clean and lube it. Water and ammonia based mixture neutralizes the corrosive salts for 8-10 hours and delays its chemical reaction bringing salt to the surface.\n\nI shoot lots of 7.62x54 and 7.62x 25 surplus ammo, which happens to be mostly corrosive. My weapons have suffered no ill due to this preventive measure.', ''),

Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy. (For those who insist that this particular gun is unloaded, see Rule 1.)\n\n3. Keep your finger off the trigger till your sights are on the target. This is the Golden Rule. Its violation is directly responsible for about 60 percent of inadvertent discharges.\n\n4. Identify your target, and what is behind it. Never shoot at anything that you have not positively identified.\n\nsomething similar from a hunting publication:\n\nThe Ten Commandments of Firearms Safety\n\n1. Treat every gun with the respect due a loaded gun.\n2. Watch that muzzle! Be able to control the direction of the muzzle even if you should stumble.\n3. Be sure barrel and action are clear of obstructions and that you have only ammunition of the proper size for the gun you are carrying.\n4. Be sure of your target before you pull the trigger; know identifying features of the game you hunt. Never shoot at a sound or movement.\n5. Unload guns when not in use. Take down or have actions open; guns should be carried in cases to the shooting area.\n6. Never point a gun at anything you do not want to shoot; avoid all horseplay with a firearm.\n7. Never climb a fence or tree or jump a ditch with a loaded gun; never pull a gun toward you by the muzzle.\n8. Never shoot a bullet at a flat, hard surface or water; at target practices be sure your backstop is adequate.\n9. Store guns and ammunition separately beyond the reach of children and careless adults.\n10. Avoid alcoholic beverages before or during shooting.', ''),

(13033, ' [b]New conditions incorporated into Pakistan aid bill[/b]\n\nPakistan will have to undertake not to support any anti-India activities if it wants to qualify for US economic assistance.—Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON: Pakistan will have to undertake not to support any person or group involved in activities meant to hurt India and to allow US investigators access to individuals suspected of engaging in nuclear proliferation if it wants to qualify for a threefold increase in US economic assistance.\n\nThe clause requiring such a pledge is incorporated in a bill moved in the US House of Representatives on April 2, seeking to provide $1.5 billion of annual assistance to Pakistan for a period of five years.\n\nClause (J) of the bill, called the Pakistan Enduring Assistance and Cooperation Enhancement or the PEACE Act of 2009, requires Pakistan ‘not to support any person or group that conducts violence, sabotage, or other activities meant to instil fear or terror in India.’\n\nThis means that Pakistan will have to ban all Kashmir groups involved in armed struggle in the valley against India.\n\nClause (K) of the bill binds Pakistan to ensure access of US investigators to ‘individuals suspected of engaging in worldwide proliferation of nuclear materials, and restrict such individuals from travel or any other activity that could result in further proliferation.’\n\nIf adopted, the act would enable US investigators to seek direct access to Dr A. Q. Khan and other members of his group accused of providing nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.\n\nThe Indian lobby on Capitol Hill played a key role in including the two clauses into the bill and had formed a special task force for this purpose.\n\nThe Pakistani caucus, which once started as an effective lobbying group, has been rendered useless by the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. To ensure that it cannot function as an independent body, the embassy purged all senior people from a support group created to provide technical support to the caucus.\n\nConsequently, the Pakistan caucus, which on papers has the support of almost 100 lawmakers, has become a non-functioning body with no clout on the Hill.\n\nAlthough two separate bills are now being moved in the House and the Senate for tripling US economic assistance to Pakistan, the motivation for doing so did not come from the Pakistan Embassy or the lobbies.\n\nThe motivating force behind the move is America’s fear that if not helped, Pakistan, a nuclear nation of 170 million people, could turn into a safe haven for terrorists armed with atomic weapons.\n\nThe need for Pakistan’s help in fighting the Taliban and al Qaeda militants in Afghanistan and Fata also played a key role in motivating US lawmakers for seeking to increase the aid to Pakistan.\n\nBut this did not prevent the House members from seeking strict restrictions against Pakistan in return for the aid.\n\nClause (H) of the bill requires Pakistan not to provide any support, direction, guidance to, or acquiescence in the activities of, any person or group that engages in any degree in acts of violence or intimidation against civilians, civilian groups, or governmental entities.\n\nClause (I) needs Pakistan to redouble its efforts to prevent the presence of the Taliban and Taliban-affiliated groups in Pakistan that support insurgents in Afghanistan.\n\nTo ensure transparency and provide effective accountability of all US assistance and reimbursements provided to Pakistan, the bill wants Islamabad to improve counterterrorism financing and anti-money laundering laws to comply with international standards, to include applying for ‘Financial Action Task Force’ observer status and adhering to the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\n\nThe task force is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe bill also requires Pakistan to take all appropriate measures to adapt its armed forces to be able to conduct effective and sustained counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations.\n\nThe bill, however, also recognises Pakistan as an invaluable friend and ally to the United States, ‘both in times of strife and in times of peace.’\n\nIt notes that the two countries share many common goals, including combating terrorism and violent radicalism, solidifying democracy and rule of law in Pakistan, and promoting the social and material well-being of the people of Pakistan.\n\nThe bill assures the Pakistani people that the United States seeks a ‘sustained, long-term, multifaceted relationship’ with Pakistan based on friendship between the peoples of the two countries, the commitment to democracy and the rule of law, and the mutual interests of stability, security, and prosperity.\n\n‘It is critical for the United States to support Pakistan''s democratic government and strengthen its democratic institutions, including its parliament and the judicial system,’ the bill notes.\n\nThe bill also makes it clear that the United States supports Pakistan''s struggle against extremist elements and ‘recognises the profound sacrifice made by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, including the loss of more than 1,600 soldiers since 2001 in combat with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremist and terrorist groups.’\n\n[url]http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/world/us-aid-bill-seeks-protection-for-india--bi[/url]', ''),

In all 40 naval vessels from 15 nations are taking part in the biggest naval celebrative fleet review. Top US navy commanders and a major destroyer will visit China for celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) navy, says an email on Thursday to Pakistan Observer here from China Daily.\n\nSeven ships from three countries have confirmed they will join the international fleet review in Qingdao, Shandong province, headquarters to the North China Sea Fleet, one of three naval fleets in China.The 6,800-ton USS Fitzgerald DDG-62, a Japan-based destroyer from the 7th fleet, will attend the review, scheduled for April 20-24.The confirmation came after the announcement of US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead’s visit to China, agreed to by President Hu Jintao and US President Barack Obama during the G20 summit in London last week.Admiral Roughead will meet his Chinese counterpart, commander in chief of the PLA navy Admiral Wu Shengli, during his visit.\n\nThe US navy also announced that Vice Admiral John Bird, the 7th Fleet commander, will join Roughead.The purpose of Roughead’s visit is to foster naval and military relationships between the two nations and explore areas for enhanced cooperation, said Roughead’s spokesman Captain Conrad Chun.\n\nAdmiral Noman Bashir, Chief of Naval Staff of the Pakistan Navy, also told China Daily earlier that Pakistani Navy frigate PNS Badr 184 and supply ship PNS Nasr 47 will join the fleet review, and he may also attend the celebrations.Three warships from the Eastern Fleet of the Indian navy, which include missile destroyers INS Mumbai, INS Ranveer, missile corvette INS Khanjar and tanker INS Iyoti left India for China on March 20 for the fleet review, Indian media reported earlier.Two warships of Russia’s Pacific Fleet, which completed an anti-piracy operation in the Gulf of Aden, started a visit to the south China port of Zhanjiang, headquarters of the South China Sea Fleet, on Monday. These ships will pass by the review host city Qingdao on their journey back to Vladivostok.\n\n[url]http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/04/60th-pla-anniversary-pak-navy-to-join.html[/url]', ''),

(13039, ' [b]Success percentage of US drone strike is just 6% [/b] \n\n\nISLAMABAD: Of the 60 cross-border predator strikes carried out by the Afghanistan-based American drones in Pakistan between January 14, 2006 and April 8, 2009, only 10 were able to hit their actual targets, killing 14 wanted al-Qaeda leaders, besides perishing 687 innocent Pakistani civilians. The success percentage of the US predator strikes thus comes to not more than six per cent.\n\nFigures compiled by the Pakistani authorities show that a total of 701 people, including 14 al-Qaeda leaders, have been killed since January 2006 in 60 American predator attacks targeting the tribal areas of Pakistan. Two strikes carried out in 2006 had killed 98 civilians while three attacks conducted in 2007 had slain 66 Pakistanis, yet none of the wanted al-Qaeda or Taliban leaders could be hit by the Americans right on target.\n\nHowever, of the 50 drone attacks carried out between January 29, 2008 and April 8, 2009, 10 hit their targets and killed 14 wanted al-Qaeda operatives. Most of these attacks were carried out on the basis of intelligence believed to have been provided by the Pakistani and Afghan tribesmen who had been spying for the US-led allied forces stationed in Afghanistan.\n\nThe remaining 50 drone attacks went wrong due to faulty intelligence information, killing hundreds of innocent civilians, including women and children. The number of the Pakistani civilians killed in those 50 attacks stood at 537, in which 385 people lost their lives in 2008 and 152 people were slain in the first 99 days of 2009 (between January 1 and April 8).\n\nOf the 50 drone attacks, targeting the Pakistani tribal areas since January 2008, 36 were carried out in 2008 and 14 were conducted in the first 99 days of 2009. Of the 14 attacks targeting Pakistan in 2009, three were carried out in January, killing 30 people, two in February killing 55 people, five in March killing 36 people and four were conducted in the first nine days of April, killing 31 people.\n\nOf the 14 strikes carried out in the first 99 days of April 2009, only one proved successful, killing two most wanted senior al-Qaeda leaders - Osama al Kini and Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan. Both had lost their lives in a New Year’s Day drone strike carried out in the South Waziristan region on January 1, 2009.Kini was believed to be the chief operational commander of al-Qaeda in Pakistan and had replaced Abu Faraj Al Libi after his arrest from Bannu in 2004. Both men were behind the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Dares Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, which killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others.\n\nThere were 36 recorded cross-border US predator strikes inside Pakistan during 2008, of which 29 took place after August 31, 2008, killing 385 people. However, only nine of the 36 strikes hit their actual targets, killing 12 wanted al-Qaeda leaders. The first successful predator strike had killed Abu Laith al Libi, a senior military commander of al-Qaeda who was targeted in North Waziristan on January 29, 2008. The second successful attack in Bajaur had killed Abu Sulayman Jazairi, al-Qaeda’s external operations chief, on March 14, 2008. The third attack in South Waziristan on July 28, 2008, had killed Abu Khabab al Masri, al-Qaeda’s weapons of mass destruction chief. The fourth successful attack in South Waziristan on August 13, 2008, had killed al-Qaeda leader Abdur Rehman.\n\nThe fifth predator strike carried out in North Waziristan near Miranshah on Sept 8, 2008 had killed three al-Qaeda leaders, Abu Haris, Abu Hamza, and Zain Ul Abu Qasim. The sixth successful predator hit in the South Waziristan region on October 2008 had killed Khalid Habib, a key leader of al-Qaeda’s paramilitary Shadow Army.\n\nThe seventh such attack conducted in North Waziristan on October 31, 2008 had killed Abu Jihad al Masri, a top leader of the Egyptian Islamic group. The eighth successful predator strike had killed al-Qaeda leader Abdullah Azzam al Saudi in east of North Waziristan on November 19, 2008.\n\nThe ninth and the last successful drone attack of 2008, carried out in the Ali Khel region just outside Miramshah in North Waziristan on November 22, 2008, had killed al-Qaeda leader Abu Zubair al Masri and his Pakistani fugitive accomplice Rashid Rauf.\n\nAccording to the figures compiled by the Pakistani authorities, a total of 537 people have been killed in 50 incidents of cross-border US predator strikes since January 1, 2008 to April 8, 2009, averaging 34 killings per month and 11 killings per attack. The average per month killings in predator strikes during 12 months of 2008 stood at 32 while the average per attack killings in the 36 drone strikes for the same year stood at 11.\n\nSimilarly, 152 people have been killed in 14 incidents of cross-border predator attacks in the tribal areas in the first 99 days of 2009, averaging 38 killings per month and 11 killings per attack.\n\n60 drone hits kill 14 al-Qaeda men, 687 civilians - GEO.tv', ''),

(13063, ' I AM A LAWYER SO I WILL START WITH A LAWYERS ONE\nA lawyer purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars, then insured them against fire, among other things. Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed claim against the insurance company.\n\nIn his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost "in a series of small fires."\n\nThe insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The lawyer sued....and won!\n\nIn delivering the ruling, the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous. The Judge stated, nevertheless, that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire, without defining what is considered to be unacceptable "fire," and was obligated to pay the claim.\n\nRather than endure lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $15,000.00 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the "fires."\n\nAfter the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested !!! With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.', ''),

(13180, ' [b]A story for the women from the women[/b]\nOne day, when a seamstress was sewing while sitting close to a river, her thimble fell into the river. When she cried out, the Lord appeared and asked, “My dear child, why are you crying?” The seamstress replied that her thimble had fallen into the water and that she needed it to help her husband in making a living for their family. The Lord dipped His hand into the water and pulled up a golden thimble set with sapphires.\n“Is this your thimble?” the Lord asked. The seamstress replied, “No.”\nThe Lord again dipped into the river. He held out a golden thimble studded with rubies.\n“Is this your thimble?” the Lord asked. Again, the seamstress replied, “No.”\nThe Lord reached down again and came up with a leather thimble.\n“Is this your thimble?” the Lord asked. The seamstress replied, “Yes.” The Lord was pleased with the woman’s honesty and gave her all three thimbles to keep, and the seamstress went home happy.\nSome years later, the seamstress was walking with her husband along the riverbank, and her husband fell into the river and disappeared under the water. When she cried out, the! Lord again appeared and asked her, “Why are you crying?” “Oh Lord, my husband has fallen into the river!”\nThe Lord went down into the water and came up with George Clooney. “Is this your husband?” the Lord asked.\n“Yes,” cried the seamstress. The Lord was furious. “You lied! That is an untruth!”  The seamstress replied, “Oh, forgive me, my Lord. It is a misunderstanding. You see, if I had said ‘no’ to George Clooney, you would have come up with Brad Pitt.\nThen if I said ‘no’ to him, you would have come up with my husband. Had I then said ‘yes,’ you would have given me all three. Lord, I’m not in the  best of health and would not be able to take care of all three  husbands, so THAT’S why I said ‘yes’ to George Clooney.\nAnd so the Lord let her keep him!\nThe moral of this story is:\nWhenever a woman lies, it’s for a good and honorable reason, and in the best interest of others. That’s our story, and we’re sticking to it.', ''),

Most of the hunters around the world consider shooting a bird on the ground or water as unethical exception being the turkey as it can''t fly.\nWe have quite a variety in  Pakistan for wing shooting. There is sand-grouse, patridge, quail and water birds.\nThe sindh wild life permit allows the permit holder to hunt all of these birds in a speciied quantity, there are other conditions as well ... my experiance is that this sport has become too expensive and the birds too rare in most areas in Sindh due to poaching and indiscriminate hunting  by the bigwigs who are as you know above the law in our beloved country.\n\nWasalaam,\nM.HAMZA', ''),

That''s what I thought when I bought the Benelli & it started having problems on the first few shots. I was sooo in love with my M3 Super 90 that I actually spent 500+ shells of magnum loads just to breakin the fire arms but that was a futile effort. Then I thought the firearm is flawed so I got it replaced by another and the problem was still there. \n\nI contacted Benelli and they told me to use the pump action if I were to use lighter loads, which is the reason that the option was provided. \n\nI''ve never ever had a problem with a Beretta EVER. From lighetest to High Velocity Magnum loads, a Beretta has always cycled flawlessly. Same thing with the Winchester SX3. \n\nI was really looking forward to buy the Benelli M4 Super 90 but I''m reluctant to buy it due to the same reason. A friend who bought it is frustrated as well. It''s useless spending 190+k on a flawed weapon.', ''),

The semi-auto has even less recoil, as the reactive force is buffered greatly by the spring. Furthermore, models like Stoeger P350 have springs inserted in the buttstocks to further reduce the recoil. Wonder, if this model is available anywhere in the country?

(13592, ' [quote=Glxspk]Kidnappings are on the rise in NWFP & upper punjab. If you think you might be a catch pls take the following precautions:\n\n5. Be unpreditable in every action. Do not keep fixed timings & use same routes. Art of war is based upon deception.\n7. Keep a weapon. Always. And when you do and you travel alone mostly never let anyone know under any circumstances that you own one. Detente doesnnt apply to kidnapping for ransom when your travelling or commuting without a personal security detail. If they want to kidnap you they will kidnap you and if they know you might be armed their primary objective would be to get you unarmed by all means which is likely to turn voilent. \n8. Most kidnappings in upper punjab takes place on the highways & motor ways. Keep your eyes on the view mirrors. Keep a good safe distance from all approaching vehicles. Kidnappers usually use two vehicles and try to squeeze you into stopping from front & rear. Almost all of them use 95-98 model Toyota Corrollas. If you see two speeding cars approaching your vehicle and the instant they''re near you, change the lane and slow down and let them pass. They''ll panic and will blow their intention and you''ll have a cushion and space to get out. If you have a weapon, I would prefer a machine pistol at that time or a handy pump action, FIRE at them & get away. 99% of them will not come after you. SHOTGUNS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS IN CLOSE QUARTER ENGAGEMENTS. Learn how to load ammo with one hand esp when driving.\n11. NEVER accept drinks & food at a strange place by strange people. Keep a LIVE chambered rounds when you anticipate things to escalate.\n14. If you think you are eligible enough to be kidnapped, you can afford a personal security detail as well. Try not to hire personnel from security companies. They CANNOT be trusted\n[/quote]\n\nGood advice Glxspk.  I would like to add a bit to it.  I have been working in the NWFP for the last 1.5 years and during that time, two of my colleagues have gotten kidnapped.  Furthermore, there have been two attempts on me so far which i can classify as attempts.  I would like to point out that I now travel with a personal security detail [i](plus have my own weapon with me)[/i] which is a chase car with two armed guards following me all the way from the NWFP to Islamabad.  \n\nDuring this point in time, we have undergone quite a bit of training on kidnap scenarios.  Since my company is a multinational and in more than 100 countries, we can leverage those learnings as well. Teams from high risk / crime areas e.g. South Africa have come down to brief us and in fact, there is a K&R [i](Kidnap & Ransom) [/i]training in Islamabad for us in this week; some experts from our global offices flying down.  The common themes which pretty much every expert has quoted, some of which I will reproduce below:\n\n1) Unpredictability - this is the most important.  Because if they mean to kidnap you, they will.  Only security to the level of a presidential detail can probably ensure safety [i](keeping in mind that in Pakistan, even soldiers in fully armed convoys are kidnapped)[/i]\n2) As far as weapons are concerned, there is an interesting view from a British consultant (ex-SAS) whom we had over for a security assessment.  As far as he is concerned, a weapon in the hand of us civilians is only a deterrence due to lack of proper training / exposure or in his words "a bluff".  If the kidnappers are willing to take a risk [i](in case they think you are a lucrative target)[/i] and escalate, this bluff will be called and either they will take you or you will wind up dead [i](since odds are against you)[/i]. In his view, weapon display or use is last resort and must only be used in two circumstances which are 1) To surprise them thus allowing you to run away or 2) If there is no choice and you prefer death to kidnapping :).\n3) Weapon will probably have more impact against an "Opportunistic kidnapping" as opposed to a "Planned kidnapping".  As the planned kidnapping will have accounted for all risks and they are after YOU specifically[i] (in an opportunistic one, they will disregard you upon seeing a weapon and will go to the next softer target)[/i]\n4) There are two types of kidnappers.  a) Common criminals - carry out planned kidnappings, try to avoid violence and b) Displaced people or Pseudo Taliban - usually opportunistic and no hesitation in using violence\n5) If you do get kidnapped, try and not threaten the kidnappers with consequences etc just comply.  They can and will kill you at this stage as they have nothing to lose.  An example is of a Wapda XEN who was kidnapped from Nowshera, ransom was paid, he was released and then shot in the back as he was walking away because the kidnappers thought he had recognised them.\n\nIn other words, I more or less agree with all of your points above i.e. 5, 7, 11 and 14.  I would tend to disagree with point 8 due to the following reasons:\n\nFirst of all we cannot be general about the cars being used by them.  In the two cases of my colleagues, latest model corollas were used.  In the case of one, a civic with a police flasher and kidnappers in police uniforms were used.  Secondly, in this area, at times police also stop you in this manner i.e. two speeding cars, specifically anti car lifting cell so before opening fire be very certain or you will go to jail for a very long time.  Also keep in mind that if they signal you to stop and you run, if they are genuine police, they will never open fire on a public road........they will follow you and relay word to the next "naka" where they WILL open fire you if you dont stop.  They will only retaliate on the road if you open fire on them.  By the way, most kidnappings in NWFP take place during broad daylight...........since kidnappers can assess you more easily.\n\nI will relate some incidents which will make it a bit clear:\n\n1) One of my colleagues was kidnapped near Lawrencepur around 9 pm.  Two cars with police flashers pulled them over and guys dressed in police uniforms took him leaving his wife behind.  They knew all the details about him and knew that he usually travelled with a guard.  From what they told him, they were ready to kill the guard and him, if he had touched his weapon [i](which he did not have)[/i].  Interestingly, he was picked up from between two motorway police cruisers [i](he had passed one and the other one was parked barely 300 yds down the road when he was stopped.....he could see its lights)[/i] He was released after paying ransom. By the way, this is the gang which was killed by the police in an encounter in Kamra around 3 months back if anyone has been following the newspapers\n2) The other colleague was picked up in broad daylight near gondal.  Two cars stopped him and before he knew it there were guns pointed at him.  Again, ransom was paid by him for release.\n3) A local influential was picked up near Swabi interchange [i](he is an "Ilaqay ka Badmash") [/i]when three cars boxed him in. He got his hand on his gun at the same time a gun was pointed at his head.  One of the kidnappers took it away from his hand.  Again, released after ransom.  \n4) A cinema owner was picked up on the GT road while travelling with four armed guards.  The kidnappers created a choke point and car had to slow down.  When guards tried to retaliate, they were shot and the guy was taken.\n\nIn my case, I was chased on main GT road in broad day light.  Once I managed to lose them by going to 150.  The other time, I had to display my weapon, point it at them which slowed them for an instant allowing me to run away [i](didnt fire)[/i].\n\nI can relate hundreds of these incidents but the theme is clear.  AWARENESS is key.  Once the kidnappers have lost the element of surprise, you can get away.  Try not to open fire unless you are sure its not the police and by doing it, you might be able to get away.  Otherwise there is no point as if it comes down to a gunfight, you WILL lose against 6-7 guys armed with AK-47s and you with a machine pistol / shot gun.\n\nOne funny bit is, my colleague when he was being released, asked the kidnappers for advice on how to prevent it in the future and what they said was a) Never travel in night time and b) If a car is chasing you, never let it come alongside you because if it does, you are done for [i](since we shoot out the tires or shoot you)[/i]', ''),

(13738, ' A ricochet (pronounced as rick-uh-shay) is a rebound, bounce or skip-off a surface, particularly in the case of a projectile (bullets, artillery shells, skipping stone on water). The possibility of ricochet is one of the reasons for the common firearm''s safety rule "Be sure of your target—and of what is beyond it."\n\nI will quote two incidents of bullet ricochet that happened to people I knew. \n\nA Pakistani lawyer went to his friend’s place to check a handgun which he intended to buy, in the US. His friend handed him the gun. The lawyer cocked the gun and dry fired it towards a wall, believing that the chamber is empty. Like always, the empty gun fired and the bullet ricocheted off the wall and hit the lawyer’s wife, who was also in the room, in her neck and killed her. \n\nThe second incident involved my Diana air gun. My uncle aimed at a bird on a tree in neighbour’s front yard while he was standing in our courtyard. He pulled the trigger, the bird flew away and we heard human screams. We rushed to their house and found their son having a pellet injury in his left thigh. The rest is a lot of nagging and a ban on our touching guns.  \n\nThe ricocheting depends on number of factors: \n\nVariables\nThe likelihood of ricochet is dependent on many factors, including bullet shape, velocity (and distance), target material and the angle of incidence.\n\n\nBullet\nBullet construction has a major factor in determining both the likelihood of ricochet as well as where the bullet will travel afterward. Hard bullets have a greater tendency to penetrate than softer ones. Bullets that break up, such as varmint hunting bullets have a low risk of ricochet. \n\n\nVelocity\nRicochets are often more common with low power calibers such as .22 or .177 calibre, which can have trouble penetrating some materials, although a ricochet can occur with any caliber. Higher velocity projectiles have a tendency to either penetrate the target, and/or to break-up on contact with it.\n\n\nTarget material\nBullets are more likely to ricochet off flat, hard surfaces such as concrete or steel, however a ricochet can occur on almost any surface including grassed soil, given a flat enough angle when hit. Materials that are soft, give easily, or can absorb the impact have a lower incidence of ricochet, for example sand. Though it may not be obvious, bullets easily ricochet off water.\n\nAngle\nThe angle of departure, both vertically and horizontally, is difficult to calculate or predict due to the many variables involved, not the least of which is deformation of the bullet caused by its impact with the surface it strikes. Ricochets will almost always continue on a somewhat diagonal trajectory to their original trajectory, unless it is against a flat surface perpendicular to the angle of incidence (or approach), in which case, it will reflect at an angle dependent on the other variables involved in the ricochet incident.\n\n\nDangers\nRicochets are a common danger of shooting because after bouncing off an object the bullet that ricochets poses an ''unpredictable'' and serious danger of causing collateral damage to bystanders, animals, objects, or even the person who fired the shot. When the deformed projectile does hit a bystander or another target it can become very dangerous. Instead of cleanly traveling through the "body/object", the bullet can behave more like a hollow point bullet, causing a larger wound cavity, or even fragmenting and causing multiple wound channels.\n\nIn rare cases, ricochets can return to the shooter. This occurs when the object struck possesses enough resistance to withstand the impact of the bullet, and whose surface is perpendicular to the shooter. Some bullets are designed to deform at the nose, which is the main reason for the bullet ricocheting at such an extreme angle and returning in the shooter''s direction.', ''),

While you may wish to teach your child how to handle a gun at a time and place of your own choosing, remember that curiosity can sometimes get the better of a child. Keep your ammunition and weapons stored in separate, locked locations. \n\n[b]Use a gun lock.[/b] In many places, gun locks are now a legal requirement when you purchase a new gun. These are lock-and-key systems that physically prevent the trigger from being pulled. \n\n[b]Ask if your child''s friends have guns in the home.[/b] It''s your choice to allow or not allow your child to spend time at a house where there are guns. Either way, you should know the answer to this question. Maybe you support gun ownership, but your child''s friend lives in a home that doesn''t take the same safety precautions you do. You need to know what kind of access to guns your child might have - that''s the single biggest contributor to gun violence, accidental or otherwise. \n\n[b]Talk to your kids about guns.[/b] Again, no matter what your opinion about guns, educating your kids about gun safety is always good idea. Teach them a few key points, and revisit the subject often. Very young children should know simply to stay away. Older children need to understand the difference between television and real life, and how to resolve conflicts peacefully. \n\nMost important of all, you should always be a good role model. Teach kids to respect firearms. Make sure they understand these important safety tips, and keep the lines of communication open so you know what exposure your child might be having to guns elsewhere. People can differ philosophically on the issue, but safety needs to be a priority for all. Because no matter where you come down on the issue, there''s one thing we can all agree.\n\nSource:-http://life.familyeducation.com/gun-safety/politics-us/59180.html?page=2&detoured=1', ''),

(13772, ' [b]China Reveals New Super Rocket[/b]\n\nChina has created a new, powerful carrier rocket with military capabilities that can launch multiple satellites into space.\nThe rocket supports China''s strategy of marketing satellites, communications technologies and launch services overseas, especially to oil-producing countries.\n\nAt the most recent Zhuhai Air Show, China introduced a high-capacity LM-5D carrier rocket with a diameter of 5 meters at the core section, bundled with one 2.25-meter-diameter booster and two 3.35-meter-diameter boosters.\n\nThe carrier rocket has a length of 60 meters, a takeoff weight of 675,000 kilograms and the capacity to send targets of 10,000 kilograms into geostationary transfer orbit. The initial flight of the rocket is expected no later than 2014.\n\nThis type of carrier rocket deserves attention, as its advanced upper stage can be integrated with a CZ-5 carrier rocket to directly blast designated equipment to medium Earth orbit and geostationary Earth orbit, or even lunar orbit. The rocket is capable of deploying multiple satellites and has outstanding capability for orbit maneuvering and orbit transfer. It can function in orbit for seven to 10 days.\n\nThis advanced-upper-stage rocket is of critical importance for the People''s Liberation Army in its research of orbit transfers and orbital killer satellites. The advanced upper stage of the rocket has a diameter of 3.8 meters, and the thrust power of the engine is 35 kilonewtons.\n\nThe CZ-5 is likely to be deployed on Hainan Island, where conditions are favorable for the launch of satellites into geosynchronous or geostationary orbits. Most of the United States'' ballistic missile early-warning satellites and communications satellites are deployed in this orbit range. The CZ-5 is capable of sending a 25-ton-class satellite into low Earth orbit and a 12-ton-class satellite into geosynchronous orbit.\n\nBy the time the rocket is ready for launch, the quality of China''s image-reconnaissance satellite will have improved greatly.\n\nAt a weight of around 14 tons, it will be on par with the technological standard of the KH-12 image-reconnaissance satellite of the U.S. military.\n\nIn recent years, China''s export of space technology, including satellites and satellite-launching services, has been closely tied to its attempts to acquire natural resources globally. The LM-5D will put China in a more favorable position, capable of competing with the United States and Russia.\n\n[b]China''s sales of space technologies overseas have so far focused on its traditional allies, such as Pakistan,[/b] and oil-rich countries like Venezuela and Nigeria. On Oct. 17, [b]China signed a contract with Pakistan to provide a PakSat-1 communications satellite and launching service.[/b]\n\nThis is China''s third such foreign contract. It produced a communications satellite for Nigeria and launched it in May 2007, and it did the same for Venezuela with a successful launch in October 2008.\n\n[url]http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Analysis_China_reveals_new_super_rocket_999.html[/url]', ''),

[b]In a report, Forecast International asserted that MBTs from China, Pakistan and Russia would account for most of the market through 2018,[/b] Middle East Newsline reported. "In terms of sheer numbers, Forecast International expects [b]Pakistan''s Al Khalid[/b], the Type 98 of the People''s Republic of China, and the Russian Federation''s T-90 — including India''s licensed T-90S production program — to continue to dominate the market, representing 60.57 percent of all new tanks rolling out worldwide, and accounting for 52.28 percent of the value of the market, through 2018," the report, titled "The Market for Tanks," said.\n\n[b]Both Al Khalid as well as Type 98 have been offered to Middle East clients. In 2008, Al Khalid underwent trials in Saudi Arabia while Type 98 was presented to Sudan.[/b]\n\n"Last year, the Chinese Type 98 program maintained its position as the single largest new-production program," Forecast said. "Yet, with a total value of $395.79 million — for 116 new-production tanks — the Type 98 program was worth only about 27.11 percent what the U.S. DoD spent on the M1 Abrams in 2008."\n\nIn its annual analysis, the Forecast International Weapons Group, based in Newtown, Conn., asserted that the U.S.-origin Abrams and the German-origin Leopard MBTs would set the standard for the market. The report said the United States would spend most of its MBT budget in maintaining and upgrading the MBT fleet.\n\n"In the congested streets of Iraqi cities, the Abrams serves as a significant force multiplier, fully up to meeting the challenges of an asymmetric warfare environment," Forecast said.\n\nIn 2008, U.S. Defense Department contracted nearly $1.5 billion for the maintenance, reset and upgrade of the M1A1 fleet. Forecast said this marked more than 46 percent of the total value of all new-production main battle tanks entering the international market in 2008 — nearly $3.17 billion.\n\nIn all, more than 6,500 MBTs, worth nearly $27 billion, were expected to be produced through 2018. Forecast said modernization and retrofit would remain a significant component of the international market.\n\n"The expense associated with the modernization and retrofit of high-end main battle tanks pales in comparison with the prospect of new tank procurement," Forecast said. "Thus, FI expects new production of high-end tanks to remain relatively low, accounting for 14.9 percent of all production and 24.22 percent of the value of the market during the forecast period."\n\n[url]http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/ss_military0245_03_25.asp[/url]', ''),

This makes the the major components of the firearm e.g the firing pin safe from residue of gun powder as there is very little space for it to enter. Glock''s intial purpose is LE/Army, so it has to survive brutal treatments, water resistance, there fore as mentioned the main parts are mainly enclosed in the slider it self, the lower frame/receiver being made of polymer plastic is resistant to water and any other sort brutal treatment, also it does not rust.\n\nGlock designed it LE/Army intentionally, which means the when the user draws the weapon he draws it with the intent to shoot, so rather than having an external safety, its internally built within the trigger with a 2 - 5.5kg pull adjustment.\n\nAll the factors combined the make Glock an excellent combat firearm and very reliable. All over the world every Law Enforcement agency employs them as their hand gun. You can dip it in a puddle and still empty a magazine without any problem.\n\nAs for Taurus, they actually employ the Glock principle. but are concentrated on volume of sales, therefore quality and reliability was never there intention.\n\nAccept the fact that very people can afford a Glock, and Taurus''s sell for a quarter of Glocks price, so anyone can buy it. Taurus is primarily a weapon of amusement and every one can buy it while the Glock is a full Hardcore weapon. I myself own a Taurus, I''ve fired almost 300 rounds from it and had only two jams due to lack of cleanness, and now i clean it every fortnight or so, and it does not miss on me now.\n\nConsensus is spend once and Buy a Glock for eternal peace of mind, rather than buying a affordable imported firearm you cannot trust.', ''),

"Carbine" Williams, he was convicted of bootlegging moonshine and sentenced to prison, in prison he incorporated the Jonathan Browning short stroke piston in a rifle which was much smaller than the M1 Garand rifle, when the prison warden found out he let him continue to make a prototype, he was released early, and hired by Winchester, and so came the M1 Carbine. It got its name from the inventor''s middle name. He was fortunate because WWII had already started and the US Army required a weapon with short-medium range of a medium caliber (A good suppression fire weapon). Because of WWII John Browning did not sue Winchester and Carbine himself for using his brothers famous design\n\nModern carbines like the M4, incorporate the basic principles, they are to be light, short and rifled, but are with a lower velocity of the bullet due to the shortness of the barrel, and have to be Semi/Fully Automatic weapons.\nIn the US Carbines are illegal which are produced before 1984.', ''),

They will only go away when their back office tells them to do so. \nI think they don''t even have authorization to shoot BGs or maybe just in the legs as a last resort. \nThe alarm signal is sent to the security company via phone line. You can get a 2 line option which will use whatever land line is free/working. Better still get a GSM option which requires a working SIM so it can send the signal even if your landlines are down/cut. \nAlso get a cordless panic button. It can be useful to have in your hand as you approach your gate from the inside or outside - that''s when many incidents happen.\nThe alarm usually sounds by mistake when someone in the household unknowingly opens a door/window while the system is armed. Or if the wind blows open an unfastened window. Or even some equipment fault.\nI noticed that we were very alert when the system was new but as we got used to the false alarms the alertness level also went down over the years. So now when the alarm goes off the first instinct is not "yikes! an intruder" but "oho somebody in the household set off the alarm by mistake".

Today I would just like do a quick summary of what grains are and what is the difference between Rimfire and Centerfire.\n\nIn a nutshell, Grain is the measurement of weight of the projectile itself. The heavier it is the more:\n\n1). Expensive \n2). Hitting Power\n3). Accurate ( less wind drift )\n\nProfessional sport shooters often use bullets with heavier grains. The fly a little slower than lighter grains but  are more steady and have less drop over longer distances. \n\nFor common usage and lack of availability of a wide variety of ammunition in Pakistan bullet weight is often ignored. \n\n\nRimfire bullets / cartridges were the most commonly used type of ammunition in the early days of modern firearms. The backside of the bullet has a totally flat back with no space for a primer, the entire backside of the bullet is the primer itself. With centerfire the primer is located in the center of the back of the bullet in a smaller area. \n\nThe main advantage of center fire bullet is that it is reloadable and can accommodate higher pressure rounds. You will generally never come across a modern rimfire bullet except in .22.   \n\n\nI would invite other members to chip in and keep their explanations as simple as possible.', ''),

However, the latter part of your post regarding membership criteria worries me too, coz this is a hot spot area, with top-notched security concern and the Shaheen club and firing range is situated in most sensitive surroundings, the roads to which have already been closed for general public and non-related entitities. We used to drive in and out of these roads, where they have other facilities as well, like the welfare club, swimming pools, tennis and squash courts, as well as the golf-club. However, there are two points, which cause me optimism: 1) 7mm wrote that he could help with memberships, thus there must be some provisions and exceptions for non-army personnel.2) The Captain of the range, during our chat, told me they already do have some members coming all the way from Islamabad and even Lahore. Who are these guys? Army personnel would not move this far for shooting facilities, they would have their own in their respective cities. However, lets see, how things unfold. Another thing that''s for sure, if they don''t allow us memberships, I will introduce the Captain and members over there to Pakguns.com! They are always welcome here!', ''),

P7 were never ever manufactured by POF. They first gave a version to ASF which was made in Germany of course by H&K with which POF has a long relationship. those pistols  were imported from germany with a "made in germany" mark. Then POF imported another lot from germany as "kits"\non the slide of which was witten "pakistan ordanance factories " the same were given to ASF as the second lot. they were just put together in POF.

Men are NOT mind readers.\n\n2. Learn to work the toilet seat.\nYou''re a big girl. If it''s up, put it down.\nWe need it up, you need it down.\nYou don''t hear us complaining about you leaving it down.\n\n3. Sunday sports, It''s like the full moon \nor the changing of the tides.\nLet it be.\n\n4. Crying is blackmail.\n\n5. Ask for what you want.  \n\nLet us be clear on this one: \nSubtle hints do not work!\nStrong hints do not work!\nObvious hints do not work! \nJust say it!\n\n6. Yes or No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.\n\n7. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it.. That''s what we do.\nSympathy is what your girlfriends are for.\n\n\n8. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. \nIn fact, all comments become Null and void after 7 Days. \n\n\n9. If you think you''re fat, you probably are.\nDon''t ask us.\n\n10. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the  other way\n\n11. You can either ask us to do something\nOr tell us how you want it done. \nNot both.\nAnd if you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.\n\n12. Whenever possible, Please say whatever you have to say during commercials…. \n\n13. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we.\n\n14. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings.\nPeach, for example, is a fruit, not A color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.\n\n15. If it itches, it will be scratched.\nWe do that.\n\n16. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," We will act like nothing''s wrong. \nWe know you are lying, but i t is just not worth the hassle. \n\n17. If you ask a question that you don''t want an answer to, Expect an answer that you don''t want to hear.\n\n18. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really .\n\n19. Don''t ask us what we''re thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as rugby , windsurfing or surfing (not golf).\n\n20. You have enough clothes..\n\n21. You have too many shoes.\n\n22. I am in shape.  Round IS a shape!\n\n23.

It''s seems Glxspk has taken a special liking to you to pull your leg in every thread ;)\n\nActually using normal slugs in a rifled barrel will decrease it''s performance as most slugs are manufactured to be fired in smoothbore barrels. The slug itself might be rifled for better performance in a smoothbore. \n\nFor Rifled shotgun barrels which are btw kinda rare in Pakistan you need sabots to effectively utilize the spin the rifling puts on the projectile. \n\nSlugs are a 100 times more powerful than a .22 and more destructive than most P.B rounds but the issue is range. Even a good quality sabot with a rifled barrel will be hard pressed after 125 yards. For rifles 300-400 is normal.', ''),

Its beneficial to learn new things from each other.', ''),

This lines is made as a final check that the bullet has bee seated in the jacket firmely and at a right place. The cartridge is also measured from the jacket tip to the bullet tip and a fine line in introduced as a check mark. \n\nAsk you friends who reload to open this bullet and check your idea that this is actualy powder.

(14967, ' No Khalidsh,  Faisal is correct. \n\nThe red line is actually a lacquer sealant to, well, seal the bullet into cartridge.  This prevents entry of moisture into the cartridge and also prevents the removal of the bullet by accident.  Finally the lacquer coat also helps to provide a very limited amount of lubricant for the bullet as it goes into the barrel as well as corrosion protection.  A lot of manufactures use a clear lacquer that is not visible, but I think that most of them add a lacquer coat simply for the reasons mentioned.\n\nYou will also find green/blue/red lacquer around the primer area, again to protect it against moisture effects.  This especially so the case with the Russian brands which were designed for adverse conditions.  Have also seen this on some Knocchi cartridges.\n\nFor example, the red box chinese 9mm ammo all have clear lacquer on their primers, but the newer batch of white box 9mm chinese ammo have a green. \n\nBullets do not have marker lines on them.  Their seating level is checked by the overall length of the ammo cartridge, confirmed by a die.  Bullet lengths vary based on their weights and composition.  \n\nThe load in a specific cartridge is by weight in grains of gunpowder.  In a factory setup this is done automatically, but again based on weight of gunpowder per cartridge [b]FOR THAT LOAD.  [/b]\n\nYou can increase the velocity and power by increasing the amount of gunpowder in a cartridge to some extent...the limitations are the space available and the ability of your firearm to handle extra pressure as well as the ability of the case and primer to handle that extra pressure.  That''s why (for example) the 9mm, 9mm +P and 9mm +P+ are all the same overall length.\n\nBTW, WD-40 will have no effect on the bullet, cartridge or the primer.  These cool dudes have tested it quite thoroughly:\n\n[url]http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/bot39.htm[/url]\n\nIts a very informative website, would urge all members to check it out.\n\nHaving said that, IMHO its best to keep your ammo as grease/wd-40/oil free because it will attrach dust.  Here in Karachi we have a lot of dust, and dust is not what you want going into your gun.  Which it will if you have oil/grease on your ammo!!!', ''),
