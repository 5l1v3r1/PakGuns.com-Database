Although my knowledge about fishing in Pakistan is not elaborate, but i have tried and tested that the river shrimp (Jheenga) preferably fresh Shrimps and a small bait fish called Chilwa in Pakistan would out fish the common earth worm or even Lob-worm on any given day. As for the Carp fishing (Rohu) i have seen anglers trying many methods in Pakistan and this time when i visit pakistan i will add boilie fishing to that list,  plus i will bring some ground bait from here (England). \nIn sha Allah i will keep you brothers posted and informed about my triumphs and failures lol. \n\nFor Brother Shahid khan, take my advice bro, more than a rod and reel advice, you need a person to show you what to do with them, i spent a fortune on fishing gear and it was of no use untill i started reading and learning from the experts. just to give you an idea bro i have fishing gear for all and any kind of fishing lol (Apart from Fly fishing) and As-Taghfar-Ullah i am not bragging or trying to impress anyone just telling you that it was stupid to buy 17 rods and around 12 reels and fishing gear that has cost me nothing less than £10,000, and i use less than half the rods and reels.\nAll this said, for Mahaseer you need a Barbel Rod preferably 3 lbs to 4 lbs and a fixed spool reel that could hold around 400 yards of  10 to 12 lbs line, if you go for mono (nylon) it would hold less and if you go for braid it would hold more because braid has thinner diameter. For rohu and other species found in our freshwaters any 11 to 14 foot ledgering rod will suffice with a fixed spool reel that can accommodate 200 yards of 6 lbs line (unless you are loaded and want to buy carp rods they start from around £100 and go to thousands).  in my opinion the best fun is float fishing and you will need a float fishing rod and a fixed spool reel for that, that will be the best budget start for you around £ 50 to £100 for everything you need. i can not tell you how i wish to be there and show you what and how to do it lol.\nNow i seriously hope no one asks about Sea fishing, cause that''s my passion and i will bore all of you to near death (if i haven''t already done it). \nAll the best and tight lines\n\nRiz', ''),

(495806, ' Kashif Baig,\n\nSome of my prior posts that may relate to the issue you mentioned are listed below. The "flyers" can be due to weight variation of the bullet or the amount of powder in the cartridge or both. The design of the 22 rimfire cartridge does not allow us to reload whereby we can control the variation in the bullet weight or the amount of power in the brass case. \n\nI have done lots of centerfire reloading. I was able to control the weight of the bullet and the power to within 0.1 grain (0.065 gram). For 308 Winchester cartridge and bullet weight of 150 grains, the recommended Winchester #748 powder is 48.5 grains. Let us see how a variation of 0.1 grain in bullet weight and in powder weight (in these example an increase of 0.1 grain) converts to percentage variation for this cartridge.\n \nBaseline bullet weight:150 grains\nNew bullet weight: 150.1 grains\nBullet weight difference: 0.1 grain\nPercentage difference 0.1/150X100 = 0.067%\n \nBaseline powder: 48.5 grains\nNew powder weight: 48.6 grains\nPowder weight difference: 0.1 grain\nPercentage difference: 0.206%\n \nNow let us do the same exercise with a 22LR cartridge. Federal Champion 22LR cartridge (#510) has bullet weight of 40 grains. The reported powder weight of this cartridge is 1.3 grains.\n \nBaseline bullet weight: 40 grains\nNew bullet weight: 40.1 grains\nBullet weight variation: 0.1 grain\nPercentage difference: 0.1/40X100 = 0.25%\n \nBaseline powder weight: 1.3 grains\nNew Powder weight: 1.4 grains\nPower Weight Difference: 0.1 grain\nPercentage difference: 7.692%\n \nNow let us compare percentage variation of the 308 and 22LR cartridges\n308 Bullet weight variation = 0.067%\n22LR Bullet weight variation: 0.25%\nA 0.1 grain bullet variation in a 22LR cartridge is 3.731 times greater  (0.25/0.067=3.731) than the same weight variation (0.1 grain) in 308 cartridge.\n \nLet us now compare percentage variation of powder.\n308 Power weight variation = 0.206%\n22LR powder weight variation = 7.692%\n \nA 0.1 grain power variation in a 22LR cartridge is 37.34 times greater (7.692/0.206=37.34) than the same weight variation in a 308 cartridge.\n \nPerhaps now we can comprehend how even a slight (0.1 grain/0.065 gram) variation of bullet, powder or both from one cartridge to another cartridge can have a very large impact on the resulting velocity thus the variation on the impact point - our not friendly “flyer”.\n \nWe can not control the variation of bullet weight, or the amount of power (or both) in a 22LR cartridge. But, we can weight 22LR cartridges and sort them in an attempt to cut chances of “flyers”. I hope that I have shed some light on this subject. Small digital scales (the kind jewelers use) are readily available at a nominal cost. I have done the exercise of weighing about 2,000 22LR cartridges.\n \nIt was reported few years ago that CCI was producing over two million 2LR cartridges in a day. Only very high-speed machines can accomplish this task. It would be no surprise to have a 0.1 grain in powder weight from one cartridge to another cartridge from the same production batch.  \n \nI hope this writing is of some help. \n \n#7 22LR - Sorting Ammo by Weight\n#13 Same 22LR Ammo - You Got Fantastic Results & I Got Crummy Results\n#15 You & Your Friend Have Two Different Rifles\n#16 Muzzle of Your 22LR Rifle May Have Answer to Your Question of Accuracy\n#19 Which 22LR Ammo is The Best\n#27 You Discovered Best 22LR Ammo - Really?\n#42 Naked Look\n#225 22LR - Rifle Suffer From Accuracy Sickness?\n#226 22LR - Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands\n#233 22LR - Minimizing Flyer Shots\n#249 22LR - Cost Nothing but Could Improve Accuracy\n#274 22LR - Ammunition Variability\n#294 22LR - Accuracy Really Elusive?\n#314 22LR - Improve Accuracy\n#362 22LR - Repeatability\n#448  22LR - Exchanging Gifts & 22LR Ammo', ''),

Why UN or  any other Foreign Country is funding this Polio Campaign...? Answer is VERY simple. They have already eliminated Polio Virus from their countries BUT they will not be FULLY safe until Polio Virus is eliminated from WHOLE WORLD just like Small Pox (Che-chak). Polio is a viral infectious disease and and can spread easily through International Travel, Mass Migrations due to Wars and Natural Disasters etc. I hope I made my point clear. \nWhy there is no Polio Vaccination in Israel...? I can only say here that there are MANY countries in the world who don''t give Polio Vaccine to their kids SIMPLY because they don''t have virus in their countries BUT still they can give vaccination to anyone who is coming from a country in which Polio is still present i.e. Pakistan. \nPlease note that Polio Drops or Polio Vaccine is not a TREATMENT it is only a method of PREVENTION.[/QUOTE]', ''),

I was out of paper targets and really wanted to shoot the gun, because it was a lovely day. So made my own. Baiscally i just wanted to see what''s the difference shooting with the kit and without the kit. So i shot the gun with and without at the same distance. here are the pics you decide which one is better. Remember it was my first time shooting the gun with the kit. \n\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20130112_145220_zps048f11bb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nFirst five shots, Chinese ammo, Withoout Kit, Distance 15M.\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20130112_151250_zpse4f8e6ae.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow with the Kit, \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20130112_151912_zps7ee18776.jpg[/IMG]\nThe bullet holes with X''s are the ones with the kit. Cicle ones are without.\n\nThe Taget area on the chest was getting bit crowded so try to shoot the head area from 25M with the kit.

Have no idea where other two bullets went lols. \n\nDisappointed with the results i got bit pissed off and shot from 15M again without the kit at the head area. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20130112_153325_zpsca99b0da.jpg[/IMG]\nHowz that for a group!

Maybe maybe not. I''ll have to shoot it more with the Kit, i guess. BTW the kit feels awesome. It''s very sturdy. Feels very comfortable to hold. Recoil is next to nothing. Next weekend i''ll shoot some more and compare the results again.', ''),

(496038, ' 22LR - Sight Rifle at What Distance?\n \nWhat distance should you sight a 22LR rifle? There is no clear-cut answer. If you are going to be punching paper targets at a fixed distance with the same ammunition, you simply zero the rifle at that distance and shoot all day long. In reality, for most of us, life is not that simple or clear-cut.\n \nOur interest may take us hunting in the field where distances to target vary. Even in these situations we have to zero the rifle at a fixed distance. Knowing the ballistics of the ammunition being used can be very useful guide in our quest for the hunt. Online trajectory calculators are readily accessible to determine flight path of the bullets.\n \nTo use these tools we need some essential information about the rifle, the ammunition and the intended zero-set distance. We need to know the height of rifle sight above the bore. For the ammunition, we need to know the bullet weight, muzzle velocity and the ballistic coefficient (BC). Ballistic coefficient is numerical measure of the profile of bullet indicating the aerodynamic design property of the bullet. The ammunition information is readily available from the manufacturers’ web sites.\n \nLet us say that we are going use a rifle that is equipped with a telescopic sight that is mounted 1.5-inch above the bore of the rifle. We will consider the Winchester 37-grain hollow point cartridge (X22LRH) with muzzle velocity of 1,280 feet per second and ballistic coefficient of 0.128. Our zero-set distance will be 50 yards. We want to know the flight path of the bullet to a distance of 100 yards. The ballistic calculator gives us the following results:\n \nWith zero-set distance of 50 yards, the bullet will be no higher than ¼ inch and no lower that ¼ inch from a distance of 19.5 yards to 57.2 yards. Past the aim point, the bullet will fall as follows.\n 60 Yards - 0.38” drop\n 70 Yards - 1.01” drop\n 80 Yards - 1.88” drop\n 90 Yards - 2.99” drop\n 100 Yards - 3.47” drop\n \nSince the riflescope is 1.5 inch above the bore, the bullet will be below our ¼ inch limit and will behave as given below.\nMuzzle - 1.5” below line of sight\n10.0 Yards - 1.0” below line of sight\n15.0 Yards - 0.5” below line of sight\n19.5 Yards - 0.25” below line of light \n \nThe above example demonstrates how other ammunition types and other zero-set distances can be evaluated. Once we learn of the bullet drop past zero-set distance, we are better prepared to compensate our aim point for those distances.', ''),

(496078, ' I myself being a doctor would like to shed some light on the topic:\n\nFirst, Polio is a viral disease that affects the nerves and can lead to partial or full paralysis, and its transmitted by the fecal-oral route (through contaminated food and water). \n\nSecond, There is [U][I][B]NO[/B][/I][/U] cure for Polio once it has been contracted. Treatment is purely supportive therapy and prevention of complications. Prognosis of people who are infected purely depends on the severity of the infection. The [B][U][I]ONLY[/I][/U][/B] cure is prevention. And prevention is by vaccination. \n\nThe Polio Vaccine comes in two forms: injection and oral. In Pakistan, the oral form is used. The oral form of the vaccine contains attenuated polio virus in it (attenuated means that the virus is still alive within the vaccine but its harmful effects have been negated)....once administered, the person''s immune system reacts against the virus to form specific antibodies. These antibodies are what fight the infection and virus in the future if the person ever comes in contact again. Because the immune system had come into contact with the virus initially through the vaccination, there will be antibodies present within the body. So if further down the road, that person ever comes in contact with the virus again, the immune system will be able to fight off and kill the virus. \n\nIn order for a person to fight off an infection, they need to have specific antibodies against the certain infectious agent (bacteria or virus). Previous Exposure to the infectious agent is necessary for there to be antibodies present in the body (Initial exposure leads to antibody production). These antibodies identify part of the infectious agent that is known as the antigen (all bacteria and virus have a specific antigen, therefore a specific antibody is needed to identify it). Once identified by the antibody, the immune system kicks into gear to fight off the infection. Suppose for instance, that a person never received the polio vaccine, therefore has never come into contact with it. This would mean that they have no antibodies in their body, resulting in no way for the body to identify the polio virus if it ever comes into contact with it....and if there''s no way to identify the virus, then the virus will infect the person and wreak havoc.\n\nSo wouldn''t everyone rather be on the safe side and have the vaccine (and all other vaccines for that matter) administered? (I myself have been making sure my newborn son is getting all his vaccinations on time)\n\n@Syed: Don''t listen to what you hear about these vaccinations being harmful. MAKE SURE you''re children receive them and receive them according to schedule. I have seen countless numbers of parents bringing in their child with infections (such as polio) that could have been prevented just by simply administering a small vaccination, but due to ignorance and gullibility they ruin their child''s life. Dont take the risk, make sure you''re children receive their vaccinations.', ''),

Maybe maybe not. I''ll have to shoot it more with the Kit, i guess. BTW the kit feels awesome. It''s very sturdy. Feels very comfortable to hold. Recoil is next to nothing.

(496197, ' [QUOTE=Trigger_happy78;334067]Shot my caracal F today after a long loong time. I haven''t had chance to shoot it with the Tactical Kit since i bought the kit. I was out of paper targets and really wanted to shoot the gun, because it was a lovely day. So made my own. Baiscally i just wanted to see what''s the difference shooting with the kit and without the kit. So i shot the gun with and without at the same distance. here are the pics you decide which one is better. Remember it was my first time shooting the gun with the kit. \n\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20130112_145220_zps048f11bb.jpg[/IMG]\n\nFirst five shots, Chinese ammo, Withoout Kit, Distance 15M.\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20130112_151250_zpse4f8e6ae.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow with the Kit, \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20130112_151912_zps7ee18776.jpg[/IMG]\nThe bullet holes with X''s are the ones with the kit.

Have no idea where other two bullets went lols. \n\nDisappointed with the results i got bit pissed off and shot from 15M again without the kit at the head area. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/20130112_153325_zpsca99b0da.jpg[/IMG]\nHowz that for a group!

Maybe maybe not. I''ll have to shoot it more with the Kit, i guess. BTW the kit feels awesome. It''s very sturdy. Feels very comfortable to hold. Recoil is next to nothing.

If money is not issue one should go for .308 or 30-06 as both are all round calibers. But in Pakistan, the realities are different. The prices of guns and ammos have reached at insane level. In this kind of scenario, 7mm is the best and cost effective solution. But it depends a lot upon what you intend to hunt. The only one game left for ordinary people to hunt with rifle is wildboar.

(496256, ' [QUOTE=PakistanFirst;333928]Kashif Baig,\r\n\r\nSome of my prior posts that may relate to the issue you mentioned are listed below. The "flyers" can be due to weight variation of the bullet or the amount of powder in the cartridge or both. The design of the 22 rimfire cartridge does not allow us to reload whereby we can control the variation in the bullet weight or the amount of power in the brass case. \r\n\r\nI have done lots of centerfire reloading. I was able to control the weight of the bullet and the power to within 0.1 grain (0.065 gram). For 308 Winchester cartridge and bullet weight of 150 grains, the recommended Winchester #748 powder is 48.5 grains. Let us see how a variation of 0.1 grain in bullet weight and in powder weight (in these example an increase of 0.1 grain) converts to percentage variation for this cartridge.\r\n \r\nBaseline bullet weight:150 grains\r\nNew bullet weight: 150.1 grains\r\nBullet weight difference: 0.1 grain\r\nPercentage difference 0.1/150X100 = 0.067%\r\n \r\nBaseline powder: 48.5 grains\r\nNew powder weight: 48.6 grains\r\nPowder weight difference: 0.1 grain\r\nPercentage difference: 0.206%\r\n \r\nNow let us do the same exercise with a 22LR cartridge. Federal Champion 22LR cartridge (#510) has bullet weight of 40 grains. The reported powder weight of this cartridge is 1.3 grains.\r\n \r\nBaseline bullet weight: 40 grains\r\nNew bullet weight: 40.1 grains\r\nBullet weight variation: 0.1 grain\r\nPercentage difference: 0.1/40X100 = 0.25%\r\n \r\nBaseline powder weight: 1.3 grains\r\nNew Powder weight: 1.4 grains\r\nPower Weight Difference: 0.1 grain\r\nPercentage difference: 7.692%\r\n \r\nNow let us compare percentage variation of the 308 and 22LR cartridges\r\n308 Bullet weight variation = 0.067%\r\n22LR Bullet weight variation: 0.25%\r\nA 0.1 grain bullet variation in a 22LR cartridge is 3.731 times greater  (0.25/0.067=3.731) than the same weight variation (0.1 grain) in 308 cartridge.\r\n \r\nLet us now compare percentage variation of powder.\r\n308 Power weight variation = 0.206%\r\n22LR powder weight variation = 7.692%\r\n \r\nA 0.1 grain power variation in a 22LR cartridge is 37.34 times greater (7.692/0.206=37.34) than the same weight variation in a 308 cartridge.\r\n \r\nPerhaps now we can comprehend how even a slight (0.1 grain/0.065 gram) variation of bullet, powder or both from one cartridge to another cartridge can have a very large impact on the resulting velocity thus the variation on the impact point - our not friendly &#8220;flyer&#8221;.\r\n \r\nWe can not control the variation of bullet weight, or the amount of power (or both) in a 22LR cartridge. But, we can weight 22LR cartridges and sort them in an attempt to cut chances of &#8220;flyers&#8221;. I hope that I have shed some light on this subject. Small digital scales (the kind jewelers use) are readily available at a nominal cost. I have done the exercise of weighing about 2,000 22LR cartridges.\r\n \r\nIt was reported few years ago that CCI was producing over two million 2LR cartridges in a day. Only very high-speed machines can accomplish this task. It would be no surprise to have a 0.1 grain in powder weight from one cartridge to another cartridge from the same production batch.  \r\n \r\nI hope this writing is of some help. \r\n \r\n#7 22LR - Sorting Ammo by Weight\r\n#13 Same 22LR Ammo - You Got Fantastic Results & I Got Crummy Results\r\n#15 You & Your Friend Have Two Different Rifles\r\n#16 Muzzle of Your 22LR Rifle May Have Answer to Your Question of Accuracy\r\n#19 Which 22LR Ammo is The Best\r\n#27 You Discovered Best 22LR Ammo - Really?\r\n#42 Naked Look\r\n#225 22LR - Rifle Suffer From Accuracy Sickness?\r\n#226 22LR - Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands\r\n#233 22LR - Minimizing Flyer Shots\r\n#249 22LR - Cost Nothing but Could Improve Accuracy\r\n#274 22LR - Ammunition Variability\r\n#294 22LR - Accuracy Really Elusive?\r\n#314 22LR - Improve Accuracy\r\n#362 22LR - Repeatability\r\n#448  22LR - Exchanging Gifts & 22LR Ammo[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nPakistanFirst, thank you very much for eloborating in detail about my accuracy problem with 22 LR.

Did you have any accuracy/flyer issue with the bolt action? I have a CZ 452 - essentially the same as the Brno model 2.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nPakistanFirst, Switching my Model 2 was one of few things, I would always regret about. I got enticed to grab hold of 22WMR when I saw a NIB Savage Model 94 with Accu Trigger and traded in with my BRNO. Later on, I could not resist my longing for having a 22LR and asked the dealer to either arrange my BRNO back and get a new one but sadly NIB Model 2 are not available for a quite long time now. I am after it and the same dealer has confirmed that his new consignment of BRNOs are on the way and there is one new model in 22LR/22WMR with inter changeable barrels. Lets see what I get. \r\n\r\nCheers.', ''),

(496479, ' Dear  members, (kamran and tank)\n\nbrothers i am a very straight forward guy, unfortunately the only education i have had in life is from the streets, i take guns very seriously, i do not joke about them.\n\nlet me briefly explain the 4 and 5 :\n\nin ancient times my father once gave me a stern lecture because i was 12 i got jumped by around 20 odd guys and them fools beat me knickers off in front of my girl friend, partly because i was young and inspired by too many movies, i took my dad''s revolver to school next day and before i know it, i was suspended from school and my gf''s father made it a point that i never get to see her again, i was under the impression that dad would beat the living crap out of me which he didn''t (unlike his nature) instead he invited me to talk to him man to man, the only thing i remember in the whole conversation which even now echos in my head was that "Son! make it a point in your life, death before disgrace, next time you pull a gun make sure you shoot some one, otherwise you should be strong enough to fend off whatever it is that you are up against without using one", see kamran, he instilled courage and honor in me, any numskull can carry or display a gun, it takes a whole lot of man to point it at some one point blank, so close that you can see the whites of his eyes, and shoot them, if you are strong enough you would never need to have a simple fist fight over road rage or a guy hitting on your girl, ever turn in to a gun fight, the latest example is the shahzeb murder case, where these BURGER bachas could have just kicked the poor chap around but instead they acted stupidly, it takes character and valor to categorize things in life, not every fight has to result in a hail of gun fire. i am a survivor, i do not believe in displaying weapons or pulling them out randomly, the last time i used a gun was at a firing range, this was almost a year ago, i do not support Ariel firing whether pakistan beats india or its a wedding, its dangerous, dumb and disastrous,  having said so, being a karachite and having weapons, it takes alot of self control to make sure that i do not indulge in to all this, we all have nosy friends, who make it their business to get you into trouble, but with guns, its all serious stuff, one mistake can cost you your life or worse some one else''s. these are my principals and i have worked really hard for so many years to make sure that i do not become the person i hate.', ''),

(496496, 'Practice Drills with your side arms AOA!\r\n\r\nI am no expert at this, but i have had the pleasure of having trained with the local police commandos (Razzaq force) i am just going to point a few tips for all the members that are critical in enhancing your ability of using a side arm specifically if you are carrying a concealed weapons. I am going to give out a few pointers which are basic yet most of us do not realize the importance,  training and drills are the key to being fast in a tense situation. The training of individual movements makes you fast and consistent, and the drills will get you familiar with your own ability and confidence. \r\n\r\n(NOTE TO MODS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REMOVE THE THREAD IF YOU THINK ITS NOT APPROPRIATE)\r\n\r\n1st Step:\r\n\r\nCHOOSING YOUR BEST MAN: it may be good to be familiar with a wide variety of sidearms, defensive practice should primarily be done with one or two pistols only, his allows your brain to store operational memory about the weapon''s operation, so God forbids, if you are ever in a dire situation, you are not going to be concerned about how many rounds can you fire, what kind of a stopping power the gun has and the most important, how quickly can you chamber the weapon, if you choose your mate well, it will all come to you naturally like dancing, your hand to eye coordination will be maximum. This will also make sure that you would be able to feel when the handgun is empty and it will make it easier to go for a reload ASAP.\r\n\r\n2nd Step:\r\n\r\nEvery one who carries a gun should master the art of reloading (i can see some smiles & some raised eyebrows). i know this will sound really dumb but You should be able to load your gun quickly 100% of the time — without looking at your pistol, your hands, or your magazines. \r\n\r\n3rd Step:\r\n\r\nMake it a habit, in fact this is religious, that you are not to lower your weapon down away from the target, even if the weapon is empty and the slide is locked, you are about to reload by punching another magazine, you simply do not point the weapon in any other direction. psychologically, lowering your gun gives your intended target an advantage over you and keeps you focused on your gun rather than on your target.\r\n\r\n4th Step:\r\n\r\nEmergency Reloads:\r\n\r\nThe technique is, when the slide locks back, you want to grab another magazine likely from a pouch. As you move the fresh magazine toward the gun, eject the empty magazine letting it hit the ground, Place the rear of the magazine against the rear of the magazine well of the gun, align the two, and with some force , place the magazine using the heel of your palm; then depress the slide release. snap caps are really handy for this drill.\r\n\r\nthis was a very basic tutorial for our members, a few tips that will help you better operate:\r\n\r\nBefore you do a drill, with your firearm securely holstered, do 20 or more push ups. Go until you have a bit of a burn and you are getting out of breath. Jump up and do your drill as soon after as possible. You will find that acute aiming is much more difficult, though general flash sight aiming shouldn''t be too much different; this is why it is so important. designed to get your heart rate up and maybe some adrenaline going which will give you a mild tunnel vision affect.\r\n\r\nThe more you practice the better you will get.\r\n\r\nWhile practicing for tactical readiness or for self defense, most practice should be quick draw and flash sighting rather than slower-paced sight-shooting. Distances should be 15 yards or less \r\n\r\n\r\nAND A FINAL WORD FOR ALL THE ENTHUSIASTS:\r\n\r\nA GUN can inflict serious injury or even death. Be sure to always point the pistol in a safe direction and never point it at something you do not intend to shoot, Only use a pistol or other firearm if you are an experienced shooter or have a very experienced shooter directly supervising you.\r\n\r\nCheers!', ''),

Just saying &#8220;Federal 40-grain&#8221; is of little meaning as Federal makes at least seven different 40-grain 22LR cartridges.\n \nVelocity (V) is given in feet per second at muzzle/50 yards/100 yards\nEnergy (E) is given in foot-pounds at muzzle/50 yards/100 yards\n\n\nCCI:\n21-gr Short Range Green HP V:1650/1128/912; E:127/59/39 (0952)\n32-gr Stinger HP Plated V:1640/1292/1066; E:191/118/81 (0050)\n32-gr Segmented HP Plated V:1640/1292/1066; E:191/118/81 (0064)\n36-gr Mini-Mag HP Plated V:1260/1104/1003;E:127/97/80 (0031)\n40-gr Velocitor Plated HP V:1435/1230/1084; E:183/134/117 (0047)\n40-gr Mini-Mag HV Plated RN V:1235/1092/998; E:135/106/88 (0030)\n40-gr SGB Lead FN V:1235/1088/992; E: 135/105/87 (0058)\n40-gr AR Tactical Plated RN V:1200/1056/964; E:128/99/82 (0953)\n40-gr Select Lead RN V:1200/1056/964; E:128/99/82 (0045)\n40-gr Standard Velocity Lead RN V:1070/977/908; E:102/85/73 (0032)\n40-gr Green Tag Lead RN V:1070/977/908; E:102/85/73 (0033)\n40-gr Pistol Match Lead RN V:1070/977/908; E:102/85/73 (0051)\n40-gr Subsonic Lead HP V:1050/963/897; E:98/82/72 0056)\n40-gr Segmented HP Plated V:1050/ 963/897; E:92/82/71 (0074)\n40-gr Quiet 22 Lead RN 710/674/640; E:45/40/36 (0960)\n\nFEDERAL:\n31-gr Game Shock HP Plated V:1430/1197/1046; E:141/99/75 (724)\n36-gr Champion Target HP Plated V:1260/1104/1003; E:127/97/80 (745)\n38-gr Game Shock HP Plated V:1260/1110/940; E:134/104/86 ((712)\n38-gr American Eagle HP Plated V:1260/1110/1010; E:134/104/86 (AE22)\n40-gr Game Shock RN Plated V:1240/1103/1011; E:137/108/91 (710)\n40-gr Champion Target RN V:1240/1103/1011; E:137/108/91 (510)\n40-gr American Eagle RN V:1240/1103/1011; E:137/108/91 (AE5022)\n40-gr Gold Medal RN V:1200/1075/991; E:128/103/87 (719)\n40-gr Champion Target RN V:1200/1075/991; E:128/103/87 (AM22)\n40-gr Gold Medal RN V:1080/994/930; E:104/88/77 (711B)\n40-gr Gold Medal RN V:1080/961/880; E:104/82/69 (922A/UM22)\n\nREMINGTON:\n32-gr Game Loads V:1280/1117/1010; E:131/100/82 (21232)\n33-gr Yellow Jacket HP Plated V:1500/1247/1075; E:165/114/85 (21074/21280)\n33-gr Cbee HP V:740/687/638; E:40/35/30 (21009)\n36-gr Viper Truncated Cone Plated V:1410/1198/1056; E:159/115/89 (21080/21288)\n36-gr Golden Bullet Plated V:1280/1117/1010; E:131/100/82 (21008/21278)\n38-gr Cyclone V:1280/1117/1010; E:131/100/82 (21222/21235)\n38-gr Subsonic V:1050/965/901; E:93/79/69(21140/21141)\n40-gr Golden Bullet Plated V:1255/1113/1017; E:140/110/92 (21006/21276)\n40-gr Thunderbolt V:1255/1113/1017; E:140/110/92 (21238/21241)\n \nWINCHESTER:\n26-gr Super Tin RN HP V:1650/1253/1023; E:157/91/60 (X22LRHLF)\n29-gr Super-X Lead RN V:770/723/680; E:38/34/30(X22LRCBMA)\n32-gr Supreme Xpediter HP Plated V:1640/1265/1038; E:191/114/77 (S22LRUHV)\n36-gr 333 Rounds HP Plated V:1280/1059/938; E:131/90/70 (22LR333HP)\n36-gr Xpert Lead HP V:1280/1059/938; E:131/90/70 (XPERT22)\n37-gr Super-X Lead HP V:1280/1120/1038; E:103//85 (X22LRH)\n40-gr Super-X Lead RN Plated V:1300/1144/1037; E:150/116/95 (X22LRSS1)\n40-gr Super X Power RN HP V:1280/1109/1000; E:145/109/89 (X22LRPP)\n40-gr Super-X RN Plated 1255/ 1110/1017; 140/110/91 (X22LR)\n40-gr Wild Cat 22 Lead RN V:1255/1112/1016; E:140/110/92 (WW22LR)\n40-gr Dynapoint RN Plated V:1150/1047/976; E:117/97/85 (WD22LRB)\n40-gr Super-X Lead RN V:1150/1047/975; E:117/97/84 (XT22LR)\n40-gr Super-X Lead HP V:1065/983/922; E:101/86/76 (X22LRSUBA)\n \nFN   = Flat Nose\nHP   = Hollow Point\nHV  = High Velocity\nRN   = Round Nose\n(&#8230;)  = Manufacturer&#8217;s Part Number/Order Number/Reference Number', ''),

(496550, ' 22LR - Thinking of Selling Your Rimfire Rifle?\n \nThink twice before taking such a drastic step to let go of your 22LR. Others that have taken this path regret having done so. Just ask those with such experience. Why not learn from the mistakes of others? Why make this mistake in the first place?\n \nIf you are thinking of disposing a 22LR to get another caliber, why not reads post #470 below and get the feeling of anguish of the writer in letting go his Brno Model 2. Yes, he is seeking another 22LR. But, the model he disposed is no longer available. What he is now seeking is a newer model, which has not established the same reputation as its older brother. People in the know still prefer the Model 2.\n \nGo ahead - sell the 22LR and get another caliber. One thing is for sure. Another caliber rifle is bound to cost more. One more thing - you will not be shooting the new caliber rifle as much as the 22LR that is still in your hands. The ammunition is guaranteed to cost you more. Do simple math - for a given amount of money you can buy more 22LR ammo than any other caliber metal cartridge.\n \nI rest my case.', ''),

The Diana mount I got from Baksh Ellahee was not lockdown and seems different from the RWS 1pc lock down mount I got from USA, the Diana didn''t work so well so I used the RWS one and Leapers 4-16x50ao. Zeroed it at 20yds in 7-8 shots but the groups seemed to be shifting up and down after few shots. Locked the zero turret on the scope, problem solved till now shot about 100crosman premier ultra magnums. The 350 is inaccurate yet I was getting mostly .5-.7in groups at 20 yes and there always was this flyer going upwards, then back to POI.... Deemed this good enough, did some pest control few days ago shot 4 crows and a kite in half hour, 40yds range mostly (verified with rangefinder). Today took put the gun, 8x zoom. There was a crow far far away hardly visible by the naked eye partly covered by tree branches. Range was 102yards (checked by rangefinder and tape 100% accurate). Had the trajectory table jotted down on the guns furniture on paper. 100yds was a 6 mil dot holdover (the gun is exactly shooting at 19fpe). 102 yd crow kill was kind of over expectation from the 350 being not so accurate in the Diana airgun lineup.

(496713, 'Remington R1 .45 calibre Handsome Beast Some days, it is as if I’ve awakened in a sci-fi movie, one where I’m in an alternate reality. I mean, Remington making a 1911A1? And just to compound that head-spinning situation, Big Green now offers a Commander-size carry gun, loaded with what used to be options. But as a production pistol?\r\n\r\nThe Commander-size format is a combination of a shorter slide and barrel with a regular-size frame, in this case, steel—not aluminum alloy. The combination gives us the easier carry size of the slightly smaller pistol with the recoil-dampening effects of steel. That is, mass. As with all compromises, it depends on how much weight you assign to each of the variables. Yes, a lighter pistol is easier to carry, but more difficult to shoot. A smaller one is easier to carry and conceal, but as you make any pistol smaller, you also make it more difficult to shoot. This steel Commander-size is a good one for ease of carry without being too onerous to shoot. As for the weight, well, a good holster and proper belt go a long way to supporting an all-steel pistol. I know; I’ve packed many through the years.\r\n\r\nThe Sum of Its Parts\r\nThe R1 Carry slide is blued steel, with Novak-like sights front and back. The front is a night sight, with a tritium, insert, courtesy of Trijicon. The rear is a plain steel sight, no dots, lines or inserts—which is the way I like sights, although my test sample had a set of drift-rod marks from where it was assembled. (Check the records, Remington; whoever put the sights on 73A needs to be handed a brass drift pin.)\r\n\r\nThe cocking serrations are thankfully present only at the rear and are six round-bottomed grooves. The rest of the slide? Standard internal extractor properly clocked, proper GI-style recoil spring and guide rod, normal and well-fitted stainless bushing, and match barrel with loaded-chamber inspection slot. If you reload, you’ll be happy to know that the ejection port has been lowered and scalloped at the rear, so your empty brass will have an easier—and less dinged—path to the ground. These are all things we used to pay extra for that now, in the 21st century, expect out of the box. Here, we get them out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe safety is large enough to be useful, but not so large as to be obtrusive. It is ambidextrous and clicks up and down as thumb safeties should. The right-side lever is smaller than the left—a good thing—but were I to hang on to this R1 Carry I’d have to make it a bit smaller still due to the position of my hand in the firing grip. It may not bother you at all—my grip is an odd one—but it’s easy enough to fix.\r\n\r\nThe high-rise grip safety is fit with a bit of play and some gaps—OK on a production gun but cause for complaint on a custom gun. The grip safety is also set a bit “hard” in that it has to be crushed to the halfway point or a bit beyond before the trigger clears it. I prefer my grip safeties a bit more sensitive than that.\r\n\r\nThe speed bump on the grip safety, the mainspring housing and the frontstrap are all checkered, 30 lines to the inch. It is nicely done machine checkering, and the frontstrap has clearance grooves top and bottom to clean up the machine cuts and provide your hand a bit more access to the checkering for a secure grip. If you’re thinking of the R1 Carry as a base gun for some extra custom work, the paneling that sets off the frontstrap checkering at the top will serve you well, allowing your custom 1911 guy (or gal) to lift the frontstrap where it joins the triggerguard.\r\n\r\nThe magazine catch is standard size, height and grooved, and the grips are wood, half-checkered on the diagonal and held on with torx-head screws.\r\n\r\nThe slide and frame have been dehorned, but in an industrial process and not a hand-done dehorning. You know how you clean your brass before reloading? Well, think of a bin the size of a hot tub with ceramic lozenges in it and a bunch of slides or frames added into the mix. They vibrate around, and the ceramics rub the slides or frames, wearing the edges slightly rounded enough to be nonabrasive.\r\n\r\nThis is a fast process, and one in use in just about every firearms manufacturer in the country (and overseas as well), but it doesn’t round just the edges you want rounded. It rounds all the corners that the ceramic chips and lozenges can reach. The signs of this show at the slot for the mainspring housing. I realize it is difficult to see, and even I have to admit it is a minor cosmetic detail. And given the competitive price of the R1 Carry, it’s a detail that is easy to overlook. The magazine well, just ahead of it, is beveled for fast reloads.\r\n\r\nThe trigger is the customary aluminum unit, with an overtravel screw and three lightening holes. They connect, via the sear, to a Commander-style hammer. The trigger pull is very clean and in the four-pound region. In dry-firing it, I could hear the disconnector “ting” as I took the slack up, but most of the time couldn’t feel it. The rest of the trigger pull was uneventful. Once the slack was gone, nothing moved until the hammer fell.\r\n\r\nAfter I had dry-fired it some, then spent a couple of days at the range with it, the “ting” diminished greatly and is now quiet enough that it takes some hard listening to hear it.\r\n\r\nRead more: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/remington-r1-carry-review/#ixzz2I4GU6ndE[/url]\r\n\r\nBear Down on Those Sights\r\nThe slide and barrel are three-quarters of an inch shorter than a Government-size 1911, which leads to an interesting phenomenon. All-steel Commander-size pistols seem easier to shoot quickly and accurately, while leaving you not doing quite as well as you might think. This is not a fault of the pistol, but rather the combination of the slightly shorter sight radius and the mass. At speed, your eye and brain see the sights as being more solid than they’d be on a full-size gun. That is, the sight alignment looks better than it is. The felt recoil, dampened by mass, gives you the impression that you are, indeed, shooting a full-size pistol. But when you look at your targets, there are the occasional fliers.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the in-between world of all-steel mid-size pistols. The solution is simple: Pay attention to your sights, and build a proper follow-through in your shooting practice. The shorter sight radius is an unavoidable result of the easier-to-carry slide and barrel length. If you want an easier-to-shoot pistol, get a full-size R1. But as long as you remember this is not a full-size gun and that it will suitably punish your groups for your inattentiveness, you’ll do fine.\r\n\r\nThe shorter barrel takes a bit of steam out of the velocities that could otherwise be generated, but we all know that the .45 ACP does its work more through bullet mass and frontal diameter than by speed. With a 230-grain bullet, 25 to 50 fps one way or the other isn’t going to matter much. So unless you’re pinning your hopes and aspirations on the efforts of 165-grain bullets screaming along at 1,250 fps, don’t worry about what velocity the R1 Carry generates. (I did check the speeds for those who just have to know).\r\n\r\nOn Paper\r\nWhen it came to accuracy, this particular pistol rewarded earnest efforts in proper technique. In other words, it is a tackdriver. The trigger helps, but the barrel and its fit to the slide and frame are the important part of the equation, and there the Remington builders delivered.\r\n\r\nI tested the R1 Carry with a selection of defensive ammunition, but if I fed it the old IPSC standby—a lead 200-grain semi-wadcutter—my bet is that this particular pistol would shoot like a bullseye gun. This one isn’t dead-on for me, hitting a bit low and left, but once I figured out where it was hitting in relation to the sights, it was easy enough to print a photo-worthy group. Reliability? There were no failures. To be honest, it’s been quite some time since we really had to worry about a factory pistol being reliable, but it never hurts to check.\r\n\r\nBeing an all-steel 35 ounces, the R1 Carry’s recoil was not a big deal, but with the hotter loads you knew you’d touched off a serious round. The grips are just a tad too round for my tastes, but a lot of shooters like a slightly plumper set of grips than I do. I can’t really complain, as the front sight came up in recoil and then dropped right back down into the slot of the rear sight.\r\n\r\nThe thumb safety on this one is a bit too easy to push off and on, but that is another easy fix, albeit not quite as easy as putting on a different set of grips.\r\n\r\nThe R1 Carry comes in a lockable Remington-green case, complete with the owners manual, lock, fired case and—hallelujah—a pair of eight-round magazines. Not everyone expects a pistol to come with a complete set of carry magazines (in the case of the 1911, three magazines), but it gets tiresome to open a firearms box and find one lonely magazine staring up at you.\r\n\r\nI really want to like this pistol, I do. It is easy to carry due to size, but has heft enough to dampen felt recoil. The trigger is nice, and the accuracy on this particular one is more than you’d expect in a carry gun. If you have a concern about holsters, here’s a tip: If a company makes any holsters at all—and they aren’t making them for Cowboy Action shooting—it makes one for a 1911. Your real problem here is too many choices.\r\n\r\nAnd then my eye rests on the grip safety and its fit to the frame. On an otherwise fine pistol, and one that delivers the goods as this one does, it is like a birthmark on a supermodel. And not in an interesting place. Once I saw it, I couldn’t get it out of my mind. There are a lot of 1911 makers in the world, and it has been a long time since 1911 buyers would look at this and shrug with a “What can you do?” attitude. But the accuracy keeps drawing me back to the R1 Carry…\r\n\r\nRead more: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/remington-r1-carry-review/#ixzz2I4GYUDiw[/url]', ''),

The subsonic had very low blast and I could feel the time difference between bullet exiting from the barrel and then hitting on the head.

(496918, '240 Flanged Nitro express A rimmed 6mm introduced by Holland &Holland in the early 1920s. This was originally a proprietary cartridge for double rifles, available only from the designer. It is obsolete and not many rifles are presently chambered for the round. It was not listed in the late Eley-Kynoch catalogs. A few single shot rifles have been made for the 240 Flanged by custom gun makers in the U.S. but it has never been widely used there.\r\n\r\nPerformance of the rimmed 240 is a little below that of the 243 Winchester, which starts the 100-grain bullet off at 3070 fps. It is also loaded to a slightly lower velocity than the smaller belted version. In a strong single shot action and using American powders, it would be possible to increase performance to about equal the 243 Winchester. However, fro double rifles this dosen''t work very well because they are sighted and regulated for a specific loading. If one modify performance, the barrels may not shoot to the same point of impact as the original load. That is why most rimmed British cartridges have a limited selection of bullet weights and velocities. The British were well ahead of U.S. in the development of good 6mm cartridges. The 240 Flanged would be a fine deer, antelope and varmint cartridge. Bullet diameter is .245-inch but 243 bullets would probably work all right and give acceptable hunting accuracy.', ''),

(496959, 'Basic understanding of Canadian firearm laws On Denovo87''s request, here is a basic understanding of Canadian firearm laws;\n\nOne requires a Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) to own a firearm and purchase ammunition and has to be atleast 18 years old. As per law one cannot carry a loaded firearm at anytime, except when hunting or at the gun range. Using your firearm for self defence is a no no. Call 911 they say!!!! For that matter use of excessive force is not allowed, which is subjective.\nHere is a link where RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) explain storage and transportation\n[URL]http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/storage-entreposage-eng.htm[/URL]\n\nThere are 3 type of PAL. (this I copied from RCMP website as well.)\n[B]Non-restricted [/B] firearms are ordinary rifles and shotguns, other than those referred to below. \n[B] Restricted [/B] firearms include:\n[LIST]\n[*] handguns that are not prohibited;\n[*] semi-automatic, centre-fire rifles and shotguns with a barrel shorter than 470 mm;\n[*] rifles and shotguns that can be fired when their overall length has been reduced by folding, telescoping or other means to less than 660 mm; and\n[*] firearms restricted by [I] [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/pol-leg/code-eng.htm"]Criminal Code Regulations[/URL].[/I]\n[/LIST][B] Prohibited [/B] firearms include:\n[LIST]\n[*] handguns with a barrel length of 105 mm or less and handguns that discharge .25 or .32 calibre ammunition, except for a few specific ones used in International Shooting Union competitions;\n[*] rifles and shotguns that have been [B]altered [/B]by sawing or other means so that their barrel length is less than 457 mm or their overall length is less than 660 mm;\n[*] full automatics;\n[*] converted automatics, namely full automatics that have been altered so that they fire only one projectile when the trigger is squeezed; and\n[*] firearms prohibited by [I] [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/pol-leg/code-eng.htm"]Criminal Code Regulations[/URL].[/I]\n[/LIST][I]\n[B]Magazine capacity[/B]\n[/I]As set out in  [URL="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/SOR-98-462/index.html"]Criminal Code Regulations[/URL],  some large-capacity magazines are prohibited regardless of the class of firearm to which the magazines are attached. As a general rule, the maximum magazine capacity is: \n[LIST]\n[*] 5 cartridges for most magazines designed for a semi-automatic centre-fire long gun; or\n[*] 10 cartridges for most handgun magazines\n[/LIST]A large-capacity magazine is not prohibited if it has been permanently altered so that it cannot hold more than the number of cartridges allowed by law. Acceptable ways to alter a magazine are set out in the regulations. \n There is no limit to the magazine capacity for semi-automatic rim-fire long guns, or for other long guns that are not semi-automatics.\n\nFunny thing is that although one cannot purchase ammunition without a licence, it is totally lawful to purchase all the equipment and materials to reload / make your own ammunition. By the way due to increasing cost of ammo, lots of people reload there ammo. This is all I can think of right now, if there are any questions I shall try to add more.', ''),

(497085, '242 Rimless Nitro Express Developed by Vickers for their Super Express bolt-action magazine rifles. This cartridge was introduced in 1923, but it was never very popular and is semi-obsolete. It was listed in late post-war Kynoch catalogs. It may have been developed by Kynoch for Manton and Company of Calcutta, India.\r\n\r\nThe 242 rimless is very similar to the 243 Winchester and 244 Remington in type, dimensions and capacity. The case is a little longer than the American 6mms, but not quite as large in diameter. When loaded with American powders and used in a strong modern bolt-action, it will deliver performance very similar to the 243 Winchester. This would be an effective cartridge for the same general range of game and shooting conditions as the 243 Winchester. Bullet diameter is .248- to .249-inch, and doubt .243-inch bullets would give satisfactory accuracy. Cast bullets could be sized to the proper diameter very easily, but jacketed bullets would be something of a problem. American bullet sizes jump from .243- to .257-insch, but some custom bullet makers turn out odd diameters.', ''),

(497087, ' Here is my conclusion after some research\n\n[U][B]Accuracy in an Airgun[/B][/U]\n.. break barrels are less accurate and keep loosing accuracy \n.. A soft trigger adds to accuracy (diana T 06 ) is the best trigger i have used so far\n.. recoilless airguns are more accurate \n.. Pellet type also matters .. in my budget i''ve found gamo flat heads to be more accurate over gamo pro-magnum and irani\n.. Scope .. for targets beyond 30yds a scope is definitely required \n.. scope clamps .. self explanatory\n\n[U][B]Power and compromises[/B][/U]\n.. with powers in vacinity of 1000fps there comes the compromises like \n .. wind factor at ranges above 50 yds\n .. vulnerability to spring breaks and scopes getting loose due to jerk\n .. nearing the sound barrier causes vibration in flight\n \n[U][B]The weight factor[/B][/U]\n..  All high powered but precision airguns have a lot of weight and require  a lot of loading effort in loading.

Diana Airking, HW and Beeman are the best if one can afford .. Some  people have reservations on life of Diana Airking''s spring like  1000-2000 rounds \n[U]Runners Up[/U].. Diana  Magnums .. Again there  are reservations by user for being spring breakers, delicate to scope  breakers .. but i thinkk these fall in the next best category \n[U]Third Prize[/U]..  Diana Mods / Hatsun / Gamo .. this would be the third category, here  the dianas are far better but the only weight factor and lower power has  put them in this category .. Hatsun and Gamo with 950 fps are powerful  but you need to adapt with recoil to get accuracy which still will not  match the 1st category airguns.. gamo is only put on the list due to its  reduced weight like wisper x with 950 fps and about 3kg weight \n\n..

(497138, ' Dear darkjustice. see below article as i took it from wikipedia. it would help you to understand easily.\n[B]\nDimensions & Loading[/B]The .22 WMR uses a larger case than the more popular [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/wiki/.22_Long_Rifle"].22 Long Rifle[/URL], both in diameter and length. The .22 WMR case is a lengthened version of the older [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/wiki/.22_WRF"].22 WRF[/URL]. The .22 WMR''s case is thicker than that of the .22 LR, allowing higher pressures. The combination of more powder and higher pressures gives velocities over 2,000 feet per second (610 m/s) from a rifle using a 30-grain (1.9 g) bullet, and 1,500 feet (460 m) per second (460 m/s) from a [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/wiki/Handgun"]handgun[/URL]. A .22 WMR round will not fit into the chamber of a .22 LR firearm but is possible to chamber .22 LR rounds in a .22 WMR firearm. This is potentially hazardous due to the difference in case diameter. When fired, the .22 LR case expands in the chamber, which can cause the case to split open or become stuck. Also, the long rifle bullet will travel in the magnum chamber unsupported for 0.4" before entering the barrel causing leading in the chamber', ''),

(497264, ' 22LR - Zero-Set Rifle for Two Different Distances at Same Time\n \nRegardless of the distance you zero-set your rifle, it will have another zero-set distance - this without any further adjustment of the rifle sight or the riflescope. Crazy statement? No - but it is true.\n \nWe all know that the rifle sight (iron sight or riflescope) is mounted above the barrel of the rifle. The bullet leaves the barrel below the iron sight or the riflescope. We need to elevate the rifle barrel above the horizontal plane whereby at some point from the muzzle the bullet will cross path with the line of sight as seen in iron sight or riflescope. The point at which the bullet crosses the line of sight is called the first-zero distance. Since we have elevated the barrel, the bullet will keeping rising above our line of sight and eventually, due to gravity, start to fall down. At some point, on the downward path, the bullet will again cross our line of sight. This crossing is called the second-zero distance.\n \nCustomarily, when we talk about zero-setting our rifle, we are discussing the second zero-set distance. You can look at trajectory charts or plug in data into a ballistic calculator and find your first and second zero-set distances.\n \nFor an example, I used Winchester Dynapoint (SD22LRB) 40-grain cartridge with muzzle velocity of 1,150 feet per second and ballistic coefficient of .1486. I entered the data in the ballistic calculator and set the sight-in range (second zero-set) for 50 yards. The calculator informed me that I can zero-set my rifle at a distance of 22 yards from the muzzle and that the bullet will also be at a second zero-set distance of 50 yards. The bullet will stay below the line of sight from the muzzle to a distance of 22 yards. It will be above the line of sight until it reaches a distance of 50 yards from the muzzle. From the second zero-set distance onward, the bullet will keep falling until at some point it hits the ground.\n \nWhen you zero-set your rifle, you are doing it for two different distances at the same time. You can adjust your iron sight or riflescope at the first zero-set distance - move the target to the second zero-set distance to “fine-tune” your sight/scope setting.', ''),

(497377, 'RIM Fire - well defined Hi Gunnerz, \nthis is an amazing article a must read for all ...\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD="colspan: 2"]A [B]rimfire[/B] is a type of firearm cartridge. It is called a rimfire because instead of the firing pin of a gun striking the primer cap at the center of the base of the cartridge to ignite it (as in a centerfire cartridge), the pin strikes the base''s rim.\n\nThe rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap which contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the propellant powder and the projectile (bullet). \nOnce the rim of the cartridge has been struck and the bullet discharged, the cartridge cannot be reloaded, because the head has been deformed by the firing pin impact.\n\nWhile many other different cartridge priming methods have been tried since the 19th century, only rimfire technology and centerfire technology survive today in significant use.\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][URL="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Centerfire_%26_rimfire_ignition.gif"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Centerfire_%26_rimfire_ignition.gif/800px-Centerfire_%26_rimfire_ignition.gif[/IMG][/URL][/TD]\n[TD][CENTER][URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fired_rimfire_and_centerfire_casings.jpg"][IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Fired_rimfire_and_centerfire_casings.jpg/220px-Fired_rimfire_and_centerfire_casings.jpg[/IMG][/URL][COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[SIZE=2][COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]Fired rimfire (left) and centerfirecartridges. \n[/FONT][/COLOR][/SIZE][/CENTER]\n[SIZE=2][COLOR=#000000][FONT=sans-serif]A rimfire firing pin produces a notch at the edge of the case; a centerfire pin produces a divot in the center of the primer.[/FONT][/COLOR][/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\nA rimfire firing pin produces a notch at the edge of the case; a centerfire pin produces a divot in the center of the primer.\n\nRimfire cartridges are limited to low pressure calibers because they require a thin case so that the firing pin can crush the rim and ignite the primer. Although rimfire calibers up to .44 (11 mm) were once common, modern rimfires tend to be of caliber .22 (5.5 mm) or smaller.

For example, Bolt action rifles may perform differently than semi-automatic rifles. .22 LR is effective to 150 yards (140 m), though practical range tends to be less. After 150 yards the ballistics of the round are such that it will be difficult to compensate for the large "drop". The relatively short effective range, low report, and light recoil has made it a favorite for use as a target practice cartridge. The accuracy of the cartridge is good, but not exceptional; various cartridges are capable of the same or better accuracy. A contributing factor in rifles is the transition of even a high-velocity cartridge projectile from supersonic to subsonic within 100 yards (91 m). As the bullet slows, the shock wave caused by supersonic travel overtakes the bullet and can disrupt its flight path, causing minor but measurable inaccuracy.\nWhen zeroed for 100 yards (91 m), the arc-trajectory of the standard high-velocity .22 LR with a 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet has a 2.7-inch (69 mm) rise at 50 yards (46 m), and 10.8 inches (270 mm) drop at 150 yards (140 m). A .22 LR rifle needs to be zeroed for 75 yards (69 m) to avoid over-shooting small animals like squirrels at intermediate distances.\n\nAs a hunting cartridge, rimfire are mainly used to kill small game. It is highly effective on squirrels and rabbits at distances closer than 150 yards (140 m) and on ground hogs, marmots, and foxes closer than 80 yards (73 m). It has been successfully used on large creatures such as coyotes, but range should be limited to no farther than 65 yards (59 m); head and chest shots are mandatory with the most powerful .22 cartridge the hunter can use accurately.\n\nBecause a .22 LR bullet is less powerful than larger cartridges, its danger to humans is often underestimated. In fact, a .22 LR bullet is capable of inflicting very serious injuries (e.g. the four people wounded during the Reagan assassination attempt) or death e.g. the Kauhajoki school shooting (11 killed and 1 wounded), the Jokela school shooting (9 killed and 12 wounded), or victims of Brenda Ann Spencer (2 killed and 9 wounded) as well as the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Numerous other shooting incidents have demonstrated that .22 LR bullets can easily kill or seriously injure humans. Even after flying 400 yards (370 m), a .22 bullet is still traveling at approximately 500 ft/s (150 m/s). A standard rimfire cartridge can have a ballistic range of up to 1.5 miles (2,400 m). Ricochets are more common in .22 LR projectiles than for more powerful cartridges as the combination of unjacketed lead and moderate velocities allows the projectile to deflect – not penetrate or disintegrate – when hitting hard objects at a glancing angle. A .22LR can ricochet off the surface of water at a low angle of aim. Severe injury may result to a person or object in the line of fire on the opposite shore, several hundred yards away.\n\nRimfire bullets are generally either plain lead (for standard velocity loads) or plated with copper or gilding metal (for high velocity or hyper velocity loads). The thin copper layer on the bullet functions as a high velocity lubricant reducing friction between the bullet and the barrel, thus reducing barrel wear. It also prevents oxidation of the lead bullet. Lead tends to oxidize if stored for long periods. Oxide on the bullet''s surface could increase its diameter enough to either prevent insertion of the cartridge into the chamber, or – with hyper velocity rounds – cause dangerously high pressures in the barrel, potentially rupturing the cartridge case and injuring the shooter. Standard and subsonic cartridges use a wax lubricant on lead bullets for the same purpose at lower velocities.[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD="colspan: 2"][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]', ''),

This is, indeed, old news.\n\nThere was quite a bit of to and fro regarding this. Some people were of the opinion that the ones shipped to Pakistan were somehow special and, therefore, did not/could not have the sort of problem some of the pieces shipped to the US were suspected to have. Others were gung ho about the weapon and shrugged off the product recall in the US (after all, a lot of people use locally made weapons which may be equally or even more unsafe). Yet others were satisfied with some Facebook posts by something called "Caracal Pakistan" or found emails from a dodgy character (not my opinion but that of the UAE based daily newspaper "The National") called Dr Kaiser reassuring or had some undisclosed sources that reassured them or were satisfied with the explanation that Caracal was examining its records to ascertain which weapons were sold to importers in Pakistan and would then be able to say if any action was required on its part. Dr Kaiser also said in one of his emails reproduced on this forum that he had sent an "expert" to Pakistan to check the weapons to ascertain if they were faulty and promised a T-shirt and a spare magazine to everyone. I almost forgot but there were also people who thought that since they had no intention of tossing their guns around that there was nothing to worry about - which is fine as many in Pakistan consider safety belts in cars to be a nuisance (probably because they do not intend to ram their vehicles into walls).\n\nMy personal opinion was that since the US has a strong culture of product liability suits and a record of hefty payouts, Caracal was extra cautious in the US. It does not manufacture different weapons for different markets and has full knowledge of who it sold which lots to (which info is available to it in minutes not in days or weeks). I did not expect the same level of after sales support that is available in the important and massive US market nor did I expect them to replace our weapons since they don''t sell them here directly or through a subsidiary (an agent, the Royal Emirates Group of which the good Dr Kaiser is MD, acts as agent through whom importers like our friend Mr Bandookwalla and others import them) and, as such, Caracal LLC does not consider itself to be liable to owners of its products in Pakistan. That said, I expected them to at least be up front about this matter and make a categorical statement one way or the other. At least owners would be aware and could take extra precautions treating their weapons as if they did not come with a firing pin block. Since there was silence from Caracal LLC and Royal Emirates has no credibility as far as I am concerned and the rest was all hearsay and personal opinions, I decided to let go of my Caracal.\n\nAnyhow, you can trawl through this forum for additional insights. In the meanwhile, treat your Caracal as if it has no firing pin block.\n\nGood luck', ''),

I could not resist my self for taking a shot at the nearest bird (the coot, which was at 120 yards).\n\nI had zeroed my rifle at 80 yards with CCI Stinger hollows but all that ammo was consumed and I was left with Federal Subsonics only. I decided to use it for the shot. I aimed at its head about an inch high and an inch to the front of its beak as it was moving and pressed the trigger. The subsonic had very low blast and I could feel the time difference between bullet exiting from the barrel and then hitting on the head.

(497527, ' [ATTACH=CONFIG]17613[/ATTACH][B]\n\ni''m thinking for stocking at least 5,000 rounds to 10,000 per caliber. For me a 10,000 rounds is a roughly 1 month supply.

(497530, ' 22LR - Front Iron Sight Appears as Blob on Target\n \nMany of us have 22LR rifles with factory equipped basic iron sights. In majority of the cases, the front sight is a bead, a bar or a post. \n \nLet us say that you want to do some precision shooting by taking head-shots of birds or other critters. In your hunt, you aim the rifle and make a quick observation. The front sight either totally covers the head of the bird or animal or obscures a good part of it. In fact, the front sight might even appear larger than the head of the bird or the animal - this depending on your distance to target.\n \nNow the question - what to do? You could move closer to the target. This act may spook the bird or animal that you are after. Is there a solution? I can think of few solutions that I have tried. One alternative is to buy a riflescope that offers fine-line crosshairs. But, this is an expensive route to take. The other alternative is to “redo” the front sight. By this I mean - replace it with a finer front sight or alter the one that is already on your rifle.\n \nFirst question? How is your front sight mounted on the barrel of the rifle? Is it a dovetail type that can be punched out from one side? Do you have one that is mounted on a ramp? Is it the type that you as a non-gunsmith will not be able take off as it is soldered or welded to the barrel in some fashion?\n \nIf it appears that the front sight can be removed, you can start looking for a replacement. If you have an American made 22LR rifle, your iron front sight may be a round bead 1/16-inch (0.0625”) or 3/32-inch (0.09375") in diameter. In looking for replacement you need to keep in mind not only the size of the dovetail or the ramp/rail, but also the height of the replacement sight.\n \nIf you can’t find a replacement or if the front sight can’t be removed, not all is lost. You can  ‘redo” the front sight by making it trimmer by filing or “stoning” it. A word of caution here - you can take the metal off but can’t put it back on. With this caveat let us proceed. You have two alternatives to make the front sight thinner or not so-bold looking. You can trim the top of the bead to make it squarish-looking, trim the sides, or work on both - the top and the sides. Before you do that, you need to ascertain that you have enough rear sight adjustment available to compensate for any material you remove from the top of your bead, bar or the post. Be aware that the bead is usually pressed into the metal. If you remove too much material, you may be compromising the bead mount.\n \nIf your front sight is blade-type or a post, the “redo” becomes easier and the mount stays secure. You can use a file or a stone to trim the sides. Bear in mind that as to trim the sides, you will be seeing more light at the rear sight - perhaps a “V” or a “U”. You should have a goal in mind as to what the front sight should look like on your target after you perform the “surgery” for your needs. Why not draw a bird or an animal on paper and place it at your “seeking” distance. As you gradually trim the front sight, take aim at the drawn paper target and check to see if it is to your liking.\n \nWith a trimmed front sight you may not be able to aim as quickly as with the original size sight. This is only natural - it will take the eye longer to point the front sight at the target. If the bead, bar or post was black, you can touch it up with paint after the surgery.', ''),

(497688, ' 22LR - Scope Elevation & Windage Adjustment\n \nRiflescopes are getting popular. Optics give us magnification to make the target more clear and make it appear nearer. Once a scope is mounted on a rifle, it is necessary to make adjustments so that the reticle (crosshair) is on target for the selected distance and for the ammunition we use. We need to make adjustments for the elevation (up or down) and for windage (left or right) to put the aim on target. Customarily the elevation adjustment knob (or turret) is on top of the scope. The windage adjustment knob is usually is mounted on the side of the scope, either or the right or the left side. The knobs may have markings or the markings may be on the body of the scope around the radius of the knob. On some scopes you may be able to hear audible clicks with movement of the knobs.\n \nEach click or mark has a certain value at a given distance. This value may be stated in different ways. Most scope manufacturers give specification for elevation and windage adjustment in terms of the movement of a certain number clicks necessary to shift the aim point a given measure at a distance of 100 yards or 100 meters or the value of one click in inches at 100 yards or in millimeters at 100 meters. Let us look at elevation and wind adjustment specifications of some of the scope manufacturers and see if we can decipher these numbers. \n \n1. Bushnell LRS 10X40mm, SFP Model ET1040\n    Click Value in@100yards / mm@100M: .25/7\n    Adjustment Range in. @100Yds. / [EMAIL="m@100"]m@100[/EMAIL]m: 80/2.0\n \n    Bushnell states that each click represents ¼ inch (0.25 inch) movement at a distance of 100 yards or 7 millimeters at 100 meters. Retical movement of one inch at 100 yards requires four clicks (1/.025=4) of elevation or windage knob. Elevation and windage adjustment range for this scope is 80 inches at 100 yards. This means that elevation can be adjusted from very high to very low by 80 inches. The wind adjustment range for this scope from one extreme side to the other extreme side is also 80 inches at 100 yards. This amount of adjustment (80 inches) would require 320 clicks (4*80=320)) to move the reticle from one extreme side to the other extreme side. In metric terms, the elevation and elevation adjustment range is 2 meter at a distance of 100 meters.\n \n   \n2. Burris 6X-24X-50mm XTR Xtreme Tactical Riflescope\n    Click value (in.@100yards): .25 MOA\n    Max. Adj. ([EMAIL="in.@100"]in.@100[/EMAIL] yards): 79E, 29W\n   \n    Burris states the click value in terms of minute of angle. We know that a circle has 360 degrees. One degree had 60 minutes. A circle has 21,600 minutes (360X60= 21,600). This angles (1/26,600 of a circle) at a distance of 100 yards is about 1.047 inches. Customarily, one minute of angle or MOA at a distance of 100 yards is rounded to one inch. The maximum elevation adjustment range (up/down) is 79 inches at a distance of 100 yards. The wind adjustment range (side to side - from one end to the other end) is 29 inches \n \n3. Leupold VX-3 4.5-14X50 DiamondCoat Riflescope\n    Adjustment Click Rate: 1/4MOA\n    Total Adjustment Range: 120MOA\n    \n    Leupold states the click value (“adjustment click rate”) as ¼ MOA. The maximum adjustment range for elevation and wind is also given MOA - in this case 120 MOA or 120 inches at 100 yards.\n \n4. Nightforce NXF F1 3.5-15X50\n   Click Value: 0.1 mrad\n   One Turn Adjustment:10mrad\n \n    We know the number of degrees (360) or minutes (360X60=21,600) in a circle. Another way to describe an angle measurement is by radians. In simple terms what is a radian?. Take any circle. Draw a line from the center of the circle to the radius of the circle (radius is 1/2 the diameter of circle). Take this measurement and lay it around the radius of the circle, beginning at the point where the drawn line met the circle. This length on the radius when extended to the center of the circle forms an angle. This\n    angle unit is called a radian. There are 2pi radians in a circle. Math constant pi can’t expressed exactly in numerical terms.  We can say that there are about 6,283 milliradians in a circle. One thousandth (1/1,000) of one radian is called milliradian. For a relative reference, one milliradian is about 3.6 inches at a distance of 100 yards. Since the click value of this Fighforce model scopes is 0.1mrad (milliradian), it would take 10 clicks, or one complete revolution of the elevation or wind adjustment knob to \n    move point of impact 3.6 inches at a distance of 100 yards.  \n \n5. Nightforce 15-55X52 Competition\n   Click Value: .125MOA\n   Internal Adjustment Range: 60MOA elev. 60MOA Wind.\n                                              16.4 mil elev. 16.4 Mil wind\n \n    Click adjustment value of this Nightforce model scope is .125 MOA, 0.125 inch or 1/8 inch at a distance of 100 yards. To move the impact point by one inch for elevation or wind, it would require 8 clicks. For this model scope the manufacturer also provides the adjustment in milliradians.\n \n \n6. Zeiss Victory HT 3-12X56\n   Adjustment Click Rate: 1cm\n   Square Adjustment Range: 120cm\n \n    Zeiss click value (Adjust click rate) is given as 1 centimeter. As no distance is indicated for this value, it can be inferred that it is for a distance of 100 meters. Finally, the elevation and wind adjustment (“square adjustment range” is a fancy way of saying "elevation and wind adjustment range") is states as 120 centimeter for the inferred distance of 100 meters, as no distance is indicated in the specifications.', ''),

Every time when i see my friends to go the dealer for buying ammo, every time the price changes. Most of the countries that import & export depends on $ or £. But but no where accept pakistan prices changes over night. When the dollar goes up the price goes up but when the dollar goes down the price remains the same. That''s strange. Doesn''t happens anywhere else but here. \n\nSo i decided after coming back from trip & once my next ammo delivery is finished. I will start stocking the ammo. I shoot 100 to 2,000 +. Sometimes in a day & sometimes in a week. \n\nThe more you shoot, the better you get & better weapons cycle. \n\nHandling the weapon & cleaning is more important than shooting. I do not move from the shooting area untill all my weapon get cleaned. If i''m spending few hours on shooting, i always make sure i spend atlest half the time on cleaning.

Perhaps the popularity stems from the diminutive size of the 22LR cartridge that attracts following by more people than all the other cartridges combined. Yes the cartridge is small but the 22LR reigns over the kingdom of sport hunting and shooting. \n \nIn life you come across many. But a select few are like classmates from primary school - always by your side. Such is the case of a good old friend - the 22LR. You enjoy the companionship and happiness abounds. Million and millions around the world have such a buddy - the 22LR. \n\nIf you are in a state of gloominess, why not shed such life and come over to the sunny side. There is no need to be an eccentric or a loner. There is no need to sit on the sidelines and watch others having fun. Get to know the 22LR.

Not a single miss fired. Under 40k you can''t go wrong. \r\n\r\nThink about the choice that you wanna make. Either you want a good budget pistol that works great. Or . You want a name brand pistol that cost double the price & works same as cf98. \r\n\r\nMost of the guns that are branded.

So if you get your NON- Restriced fire arm-licence you can own many shotguns and rifles (all nearly all Bolt action and limited semi-automatic). You do not need multiple license for multiple weapons, just one license for multiple weapons. Just go to gun shop buy your weapon and keep it in your house. Just renew your license after 5 years, no weapons yearly fee or police department regestration required.\n\nBad thing is Pistol licence is Restriced Weapon license. It has many restriction on the movement of the firearm.

(498144, ' 22LR - Do You Plex?\n \nMany 22LR rifles nowadays are equipped with telescopic sights. One common reticle (crosshair) is often called Multi-X, 30/30, Dual-X or simply Plex. These types have thin and bold reticles. The bold reticle only extends part way toward the center. The thin portion is used for range finding. One of the scopes I have is of such design that the visible thin portion of the reticle represents 30 inches when viewed with 4-power magnification at a distance of 100 yards. The thickness of the reticle does not change with change in magnification, which in this case varies from 3 to 9 power. You are not limited to using the Plex type of scope for distance of 100 yards and target size of 30 inches. The examples given below demonstrate how you can use this type of scope for different distances and different size targets by simple manipulation of some numbers. We bracket the target in the thin portion of the reticle.\n \n1. Target size is changed from 30 inches to 15 inches. What is the distance to target?\n\n    15/30 * 100 = 50 yards\n \n2. The distance to target is 50 yard and magnification is increased from 4-power to 8-power. What is size of the target?\n\n    4/8 * 15 = 7.5 inches\n \nYou can make table(s) for various size targets for the range of magnifications that your scope offers. Here are the bracketed target sizes in inches for various magnifications at 100 yards.\n\n3X  -  40  inches . . . . (4/3 * 40)\n4X  -  30  inches . . . . (4/4 * 40)\n5X  -  24  inches . . . . (4/5 * 30)\n6X  -  20  inches . . . . (4/6 * 30)\n7X  -  17.14 inches . .(4/7 * 30)\n8X  -  15   inches . . . . (4/8 * 30)\n9X  -  13.33 inches . .(4/9 * 30)\n \nHere are the bracketed target sizes in inches for the indicated distances with 4-power magnification.\n\n100 yards  - 30  inches\n  90 yards  - 27  inches  (90/100 * 30)\n  80 yards  - 24  inches  (80/100 * 30)\n  70 yards  - 21  inches  (70/100 * 30)\n  60 yards  - 18  inches  (60/100 * 30)\n  50 yards  - 15  inches  (50/100 * 30)\n  40 yards  - 12  inches  (40/100 * 30)\n  30 yards  -  9    inches .

(498214, '240 Belted Rimless Nitro Express Designed by Holland & Holland and introduced about 1923 for bolt-action magazine rifles. It has been used in the U.S. to a limited degree in custom rifles, probably more so than in British rifles. This is also known as the 240 Apex.\r\n\r\nThe 240 Belted has been popular in England and Scotland for open country shooting of deer or stag. It is really a fine cartridge for any long-range shooting and would be good for deer, black bear, antelope and possibly elk in North America. Loaded in England, it was a little less powerful than the 243 Winchester. However, it is a larger cartridge than the 243, being about the size of the 30-06 case. With American powders it could undoubtedly be stepped up to or equal of surpass the 243 Winchester. Because of its length, it is not suitable for medium-length actions. Because British ammunition was often used in tropical and desert climates, they like to keep pressures down to a reasonable level and most of their cartridges can be safely loaded to higher than standard velocity with American powders.', ''),

(498219, '7.5mm Swiss Army This cartridge was adopted by the Swiss Army in 1882 and officially used until 1903. The Swiss army revolver is based on a modified Nagant system. During 1963-64, quantities of these revolvers were sold in the American market by surplus military dealers. They are quite well made nad finished. Both black-powder and smokeless powder is encountered.\r\n\r\nThe 7.5mm revolver cartridge is identical to and fully interchangeable with the 7.5mm Swedish and Norwegian rounds. Modern smokeless ammunition was loaded by Norma for the Swedish Nagant about few decades ago, and this can also be used in the Swiss revolver. The two cartridges differ only in bullet type. Most Swedish ammo has an outside-lubricated type. Power is about the same as the 32 S&W Long. For additional information, see the 7.5mm Swedish Nagant Revolver.', ''),

(498221, '244 Belted Rimless Magnum (H&amp;H) This, one of the latest developments by Holland & Holland, was introduced in 1955 for their Mauser-type bolt-action sporting rifles. Both British and custom-made rifles of this caliber have been used by American shooters. It has been so popular that various loading hand-books have listed it.\r\n\r\nThe high-velocity 244 Holland & Holland Magnum is based on the 375 Magnum case necked-down. This is a large capacity case for the caliber and undoubtedly of over-bore capacity with currently available powders. Only the very slow burning powders will develop maximum velocity, and the British were forced to use something other than the tried and true Cordite for this cartridge. American powders such as 4350, 4831 and the now discontinued H570 give quite impressive results with bullets of around 100 grains. Holland & Holland advertise a muzzle velocity of 3500 fps with the 100-grain bullet. According to the old SPEER MANUAL OF RELOADING, their chronograph tests with British Kynoch ammunition and a 26-inch barreled H&H rifle recorded an average of only 3276 fps. Nothing to be really ashamed of, but considering the difference in case size, not a great deal better than the 6mm Remington. Nonetheless, the 244 Magnum is a long-range cartridge that, under ideal conditions, would be adequate for most North American big game. It would, of course, be an excellent varmint number under any and all conditions.', ''),
(498222, '7.5mm Swedish Nagant Revolver The cartridge listed here is the 7.5mm Swedish caliber for the 1887 Swedish Nagant military revolver manufactured by Husqvarna. Large numbers of these revolvers have been sold as surplus in the U.S. since the end of WWII. This has a short, rimmed case with an outside-lubricated bullet and is usually loaded with black-powder. The revolver is long obsolete, but Norma of Sweden loaded this cartridge with Berdan primmed cases about few decades ago and some of that might still be found.\r\n\r\nThe 7.5mm Swedish Nagant Revolver cartridge was practically unknown in the U.S. prior to about 1948. Many Nagant revolvers were altered to use the 22 Long Rifle by lining the barrel and bushing the cylinder. The 32 Short or Long Colt can be fired in these revolvers, but it fits loosely and accuracy is terrible. Cartridges can be made from empty 32-20 brass trimmed back to .895-inch or even 1-inch in length. The Austrian 310 Martini cartridge will also work if cut to the proper length. The Swedish Nagant revolver was intended for black-powder, and only low pressure smokeless loads are entirely safe. With proper loads and bullets, the 7.5mm cartridge is in about the same class as the 32 S&W Long.', ''),

As with most cartridges designed for double rifles, only one loading was available.\r\n\r\nThe House of Purdey is credited with having originated the term "Express Train" rifle back in 1856. This was later shortened to simply  "Express" rifle and widely used to indicate high velocity or greater power than standard. The term is still used both in Britain and the U.S., but has been largely superseded by the word "Magnum".', ''),
(498251, '8mm Lebel Revolver Cartridge for the French 1892 Ordinance Revolver, commonly called the Lebel. this is a six-shot, solid-frame, double-action gun. Bayard and Pieper also made revolvers of this caliber. Small lots have shown up in surplus stores, but this is not a widely-used item, being of interest mostly to military collectors.\r\n\r\nThe 8mm Lebel revolver cartridge closely resembles the 32-20 WCF and ammunition can be made by sizing 32-30 brass. It is not a common item, but surplus stores have had this ammunition available. The 32 S&W Long can be fired in these revolvers, but the cases bulge badly and accuracy is poor. When cooking up your own loads, stick to moderate charges and velocity as the Lebel revolver is not designed for high pressures. For field use, this is another 32 S&W Long class cartridge suitable only for small game. Bullet diameter is .330-inch and one can use the Lyman #32359 cast bullet.', ''),

Both rifles and cartridges are quite rare in the U.S. Incidentally, the rook is a bird similar to the crow.\r\n\r\nIn performance, the 297/250 is similar to the old 25 Stevens rimfire. However, it is a centerfire, bottle-necked shell and can be reloaded. There were a half dozen or more of these so-called "rook" cartridges and none of them were very widely used outside Britain.

It was also used in modified 1925 model and the odd-looking 1934 model This was the official Japanese sidearm cartridge in WWII, although other pistols and cartridges were used.\r\n\r\nQuite a few 8mm Nambu pistols were brought back from the Pacific battle areas by returning GIs at war''s end. Ammunition has been a problem because most captured stores were destroyed. The cartridge resembles the 7.65mm Luger, but uses a large diameter bullet and a semi-rimmed case. In power, it is only slightly superior to the 32 ACP. Most of the pistols are collector''s items and of little practical value. Bullet diameter is .320-inch and no light -jacketed bullets of this diameter are available for loading. Cast 32 revolver bullets sized as close to this as possible would undoubtedly work OK in weights of from 83 to 100 grains. Use only light charges of powder. Bell Basic Brass (formerly B.E.L.L. Extrusion Laboratories, Ltd. of Bensenville), Illinois, had manufactured 8mm Nambu brass for Midway Arms, Inc. of Columbia , Missouri.

Only moderate quantities of these pistols have been sold to date.\r\n\r\nThe 8mm Roth-Steyr cartridge is sizing to the 32 ACP, but longer and somewhat more powerful. It would make a fair field cartridge for small game if loaded with hunting-type bullets. The Roth-Steyr pistol holds 10 shots and the magazine is in the handle. As with most Austrian-designed auto pistols of the period, it is loaded by retracting the slide (bolt) and inserting a special charger from the top; it can be loaded without the charger, but this is rather slow and hard on the fingers.', ''),

(498273, '26 Rimless Nitro Express (BSA) Introduced by Birmingham Small Arms for their bolt-action sporting rifles based on the 1914 Enfield military action. Now obsolete, it originated sometime in the 1920s, as near as can be established. Although listed as a rimless case, it is actually a belted rimless case of rather advanced design.\r\n\r\nThis 6.5mm cartridge might be considered something of a belted 6.5mm Mannlicher. It is possible to get around 3000 fps with the 110-grain bullet in the Mannlicher case, but is ordinarily loaded with bullets of 140 to 160 grains. The 26 BSA was intended to appeal those interested in high velocity, and it does rather well with the comparatively light 110-grain bullet. It is also an example of what happens when every other feature is sacrificed for the last fps of velocity. It looks good on paper, but it isn''t effective on anything larger than deer, and it''s not entirely satisfactory on animals of this class. On the other hand, some of the other 6.5mm cartridges, with heavier bullets of lower velocity, have a fine reputation on all kinds of big game. As factory loaded, the 26 BSA was not a very versatile cartridge for North American hunting conditions. If hand-loaded with bullets of heavier weight, it could be made as effective an all-round cartridge as any of the other 6.5s of similar case capacity. Head diameter is close to that of the 300 H&H Magnum, and one could probably make cases by reforming 300 brass.', ''),

(498363, '8mm Rast-Gasser Cartridge for the Austrian-made Rast-Gasser military revolver. The original design of this solid-frame, rod-ejector gun was patented about 1873. The 8mm military cartridge, however, appears to have been introduced in 1898. A number of different type revolvers manufactured in Belgium and Germany also chambered the round. Although fairly popular in Europe, the 8mm Rast-Gesser was never adopted or manufactured in the U.S. The round is obsolete and ammunition is difficult to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe Gesser solid-frame revolver design is noted for the simplicity of dis-assembly. It also has a rebounding hammer and a spring-mounted, separate firing pin. They are usually well made and rather sturdy. Quantities have been sold at various times in surplus stores.\r\nThe cartridge resembles the 8mm Lebel Revolver round quite closely. Bullet diameter is .320-inch. Rim and body diameter are nearly identical to the 32 S&W Long. The S&W case is shorter, but both cartridges are of same power. Lyman cast bullet #313445 (95-grains) can be adopted for hand-loading. A Bullseye charge of 2.2 grains will give about 800 fps. Loading data for the 32 S&W can be used as a guide in working up loads.', ''),

(498558, '9mm Ultra Cartridge for the Walther PP Super semi-auto pistol introduced in 1972-73. This seven-shot autoloader is of the blowback type and was designed particularly for the West German police. The pistol was not available to the civilian market until about 1975 and then only in small numbers. Very few guns in this caliber have shown up in the U.S. In recent years, the Sig-sauer P-230 and the Benelli B7 auto pistols have also been chambered for the 9mm Ultra.The TA-18 pistol made by Tongfolio Giuseppe may also be so chambered on special order. The cartridge was actually developed in 193 for the German air force, but was never officially adopted.\r\nThe 9mm Ultra is between the 380 ACP and the 9mm Luger, having the same general case dimensions, but is 1mm longer than the former and 1mm shorter than than the latter. In terms of inches, the 380 case length is .680-inch, the 9mm Ultra is .720-inch and the 9mm Luger is .760-inch. The original loading of the 9mm Ultra by Hirtenberger of Austria was a 100-grain full-jacketed bullet at a muzzle velocity of 1060 fps. GECO (Dynamit-Nobel) loads a 94-grain full-jacketed bullet at an initial velocity of 1054 fps. The ammunition is very difficult to find in the U.S., and American companies do not load it.\r\n\r\nEuropean police have traditionally carried 32 ACP and 380 ACP semi-auto pistols. However, with the increase in crime and attacks of terrorist groups, they found themselves out-gunned by those on the other side of the law. There was, on the other hand, some reluctance to adopt the full-powered 9mm military auto pistol, which is much heavier and bulkier than the more convenient 32 and 380 autos. The 9mm Ultra was an effort to provide greater firepower while still retaining the small, handy pistol police were used to carrying. It has achieved at least a measure of success in fulfilling that requirement.\r\nThere is really no great improvement over the 380 ACP in terms of potential stopping power. It is interesting to note that many European police organizations are changing over from the 9mm Ultra to the standard 9mm Luger military cartridge. It is quite possible that some of these 9mm Ultra guns will show up in the U.S. and other countries.\r\nThe best that can be said about the 9mm Ultra is that it is as good and probably a little better (more effective) than the 380 ACP. Hand-loaded with 9mm jacketed hollow-point bullets, it would certainly be satisfactory for small game hunting. No, the author does not know where you can get either handgun or ammunition of this caliber.', ''),

It is also used in other pistols and submachine guns and was the official Italian pistol cartridge in WWI and II. It is similar in physical measurement to the 9mm Luger (Parabellum), but is not loaded as heavily. regular 9mm Luger ammunition should not be fired in pistols intended for the Glisenti cartridge or loading. It is in about the same class as the 380 ACP and is not as quite powerful as the standard 9mm Luger. Quite a few Glisenti pistols have been sold on the American market through surplus military dealers. Ammunition can be made by loading 9mm Luger cases down to the proper velocity-pressure level.', ''),

(498619, '275 Belted Rimless Magnum Nitro (H&amp;H) 275 Flanged Magnum (H&amp;H) This cartridge known in the U.S. as the 275 H&H Magnum, was loaded by the Western Cartridge Company until about 1939. Introduced in England in 1912-13, it is one of the first of the 7mm magnum class. It came out shortly after the 280 Ross created quite a stir in the small-bore, high-velocity field. A fair number of american custom rifles were made for the round, but no factory rifles. The rimmed version was for single shot and double rifles; its factory load provided a muzzle velocity of 2575 fps with a 160-grain bullet. It was developed by W.F. Jones as an improvement of the 280 Ross.\r\n\r\nThe 275 H&H Magnum is similar to the 276 Dubiel and the wildcat 7mm Ackley Magnum. The 7x61mm Sharpe & Hart, the 7mm Mashburn Short Magnum and a number of other wildcat developments are also in the same class. None of these will do anything the others can''t more or less duplicate. With American powders, the performance of the 275 H&H Magnum can be improved a bit, within acceptable pressure limits. This is a good long-range caliber for mountain or plains hunting.

(498620, '275 Belted Rimless Magnum Nitro (H&amp;H) 275 Flanged Magnum (H&amp;H) This cartridge known in the U.S. as the 275 H&H Magnum, was loaded by the Western Cartridge Company until about 1939. Introduced in England in 1912-13, it is one of the first of the 7mm magnum class. It came out shortly after the 280 Ross created quite a stir in the small-bore, high-velocity field. A fair number of American custom rifles were made for the round, but no factory rifles. The rimmed version was for single shot and double rifles; its factory load provided a muzzle velocity of 2575 fps with a 160-grain bullet. It was developed by W.F. Jones as an improvement of the 280 Ross.\r\n\r\nThe 275 H&H Magnum is similar to the 276 Dubiel and the wildcat 7mm Ackley Magnum. The 7x61mm Sharpe & Hart, the 7mm Mashburn Short Magnum and a number of other wildcat developments are also in the same class. None of these will do anything the others can''t more or less duplicate. With American powders, the performance of the 275 H&H Magnum can be improved a bit, within acceptable pressure limits. This is a good long-range caliber for mountain or plains hunting. It is adequate for just about any North American big game and most African plains varieties under ideal conditions. It is not the thing for dangerous game in close cover, here or any place else. The smaller 280 Remington will do almost as well in most bullet weights.', ''),

(498635, '9mm Steyr Austrian military pistol cartridge for the Steyr Model 1912 auto pistol. This is an exposed hammer, recoil-operated design that in appearance looks like some of the early Colt automatic pistols. Apparently the only other country besides Austria to use this as a military round was Romania, who adopted both the Steyr pistol and cartridge in 1912. The cartridge is very similar to the 9mm Bergmann-Bayard and the two are often confused. Quantities of the 9mm Steyr pistols have appeared on the surplus military market and for a time ammunition was readily available.\r\n\r\nThe 9mm Steyr is quite similar to the 9mm Bayard, and the Astra Model 400 will handle both, but other pistols won''t. Like most early Austrian auto pistols, the Steyr is loaded by means of charger inserted in the top of the magazine after drawing back the slide. Magazine capacity is eight rounds. This is pretty good field cartridge, similar to the 38 Colt ACP in performance. Bullet diameter is the same as the 9mm Luger and one can use Luger bullets for reloading. Any standard load for the 9mm Luger or 38 ACP will work in the Steyr pistol.', ''),

(498637, ' 22LR - How Many Clicks?\n \nYou have had your 22LR rifle for some time. So far you have used iron sights for your shooting needs.  You have been thinking about getting a scope for this rifle. You have reviewed features of the various makes and models in the marketplace. You have chosen a scope that fits your budget. This particular scope has click value of ¼ inch at 100 yards. You know that if you change the elevation or wind adjustment knob by one click, you point of impact will shift by ¼ inch at a distance of 100 yards.\n \nYou have mounted the scope on the rifle and now are ready to zero-set it. You don&#8217;t want to go out to 100 yards to set up your target. You set your target at 50 yards. You fire a few shots at the target and discover that the bullets land two inches low. How many click adjustments of the scope''s elevation knob do you need to make in this case the bring the point of impact in line with the target?  \n \nThe clicks are angular adjustments. A given angular adjustment (in this case one click) has different linear value depending on the distance from the spot where the adjustment is made. The specification of this scope indicates that one click will shift point of impact by ¼ inch at 100 yards. The scope''s elevation knob will require four clicks (1/0.25=4) to shift point of impact by one inch.\n \nIf you cut the specified distance (100 yards) in half (50 yards), the linear value of the adjustment will also be cut in half - from ¼ inch per click to 1/8 inch per click. If you double the distance (say from 100 to 200 yards) the linear value of one click adjustment will also double - in this case from 1/4 inch to ½ inch.\n \nHere is a table for illustration. In this table one scope has a click value of ¼ inch at 100 yards and the other scope has a click value of 1/8 inch at 100 yards .The column headings indicate the distances. Under each distance column are two values The first one is for a scope that is rated at ¼ inch and 100 yards and the second one is rated at 1/8 inch 100 yards.\n \n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD] Yards[/TD]\n[TD]18[/TD]\n[TD]20[/TD]\n[TD]22[/TD]\n[TD]24[/TD]\n[TD]25[/TD]\n[TD]40[/TD]\n[TD]50[/TD]\n[TD]60[/TD]\n[TD]80[/TD]\n[TD]100[/TD]\n[TD]200[/TD]\n[TD]400[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]¼&#8221; @ 100 Y[/TD]\n[TD]22*[/TD]\n[TD]20[/TD]\n[TD]18*[/TD]\n[TD]17*[/TD]\n[TD]16[/TD]\n[TD]10[/TD]\n[TD]8[/TD]\n[TD]7*[/TD]\n[TD]5[/TD]\n[TD]4[/TD]\n[TD]2[/TD]\n[TD]1[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]1/8&#8221;@ 100 Y[/TD]\n[TD]44*[/TD]\n[TD]40[/TD]\n[TD]36*[/TD]\n[TD]33*[/TD]\n[TD]32[/TD]\n[TD]20[/TD]\n[TD]16[/TD]\n[TD]13*[/TD]\n[TD]10[/TD]\n[TD]8[/TD]\n[TD]4[/TD]\n[TD]2[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n \n* = Results are rounded.\n \nHow to use this table - example:\n \nYour target is at 40 yards. Your scope is one that has click value of ¼ inch at 100 yards. You want to change the point of impact by 1.5 inches. How many clicks are required to shift the point of impact? Look down under column headed &#8220;40&#8221;. The first number below this heading is &#8220;10&#8221;. At a distance of 40 yards, 10 clicks will shift the point impact by one inch. You want to move it by 1.5 inch. In this case your dial 15 clicks (10*1.5=15) for the needed shift.\n\nThis table gives low-end distances of 18,20,22,24 and 25 yards.

(498646, '9mm Mauser This cartridge was developed for the "Export Model" Mauser auto pistol and introduced in 1908. Both the cartridge and the pistol chambered for it had a relatively short life, discontinued in 1914 with the outbreak of WWI, and production was not resumed after the war. The 9mm Mauser was designed as a more powerful round than the 7.63mm Mauser in an effort to capture some of the overseas trade in places like Africa and South America. Unfortunately, it failed in this effort and never became very popular, although it''s a potentially a good field cartridge. The 9mm Mauser was revived in 1933-34 when the Swiss-designed Neuhausen sub-machine gun and later the Austrian Steyr-Solothurn were chambered for the round. As a result, manufacture of the cartridge was resumed in several European countries. Today, the 9mm Mauser (DWM No.487) is largely a collector''s item.\r\n\r\nThe 9mm Mauser is, in standard factory loading, more powerful than the 9mm Luger and also has an edge on the 38 Colt Super Automatic. It develops 534 fpe at the muzzle compared to 387 and 430 for top factory loadings of the 9mm Luger and 38 Colt Super, respectively. The 9mm Mauser is loaded with a 123- or 128-grain full-jacketed bullet at an initial velocity, according to the DWM catalog, of 1362 fps. With modern soft-point bullets, it would make a good small to medium game hunting cartridge. The case is approximately .23-inch longer than the 9mm Luger, is rimless and Berdan-primed. Empty cases could be reloaded with any standard 9mm (.355-inch) bullets of 100 to 130 grains in weight.', ''),

(498689, '9mm Federal The 9mm Federal was introduced by Federal Cartridge Co. and first appeared in their 1989 ammunition catalog. It is a rimmed version of the rimless 9mm Luger, intended for use in revolvers. The first handgun specifically chambered for it is the Charter arms Pit Bull revolver, also introduced in 1989. This is a five shot double action revolver with a 21/2-inch barrel similar to the older Police Bulldog model. The use of the rimless 9mm Luger in revolvers has never been entirely satisfactory because of extraction difficulties. The 9mm federal was designed to eliminate in the same way that the 45 Auto Rim removed the need for the half-moon clips in 45 ACP revolvers. However, the 9mm Federal lacks the very thick rim characteristic of the 45 Auto Rim. as this is written, the Charter Arms Pit Bull is the only revolver available for the 9mm Federal.\r\n\r\nInitial loading of the 9mm Federal is a 115-grain jacketed hollow-pointed bullet at 1280 fps muzzle velocity from a 4-inch test barrel. Ballistically this equals or exceeds most +P 38 Special loads and is pushing close to 357 Magnum performance. The principal advantage of the 9mm federal is the short case length which would allow shortening the length of the cylinder and frame of revolvers designed for it, thus reducing weight and bulk. As a self defence or field cartridge it would be equal to the 9mm Luger . Unfortunately, the 9mm Federal will chamber in most 38 S&W revolvers, but should never be fired in these, particularly the old top-break type, as this might result in damage to the revolver and possible injury to the shooter. Also some lots or makes of 38 S&W will fit the 9mm Federal chamber, but again it is not safe practice to fire these either. Last, but not least, 9mm Luger cartridges will chamber and fire in 9mm Federal revolvers, but this can create extraction and other mechanical problems. In all cases, stick to the ammunition that a weapon is chambered for it. It is highly probable that others besides Charter Arms will introduce revolvers for the 9mm federal over the next few years. reloading data for the 9mm Luger can be used as a guide in working up reloads.', ''),

(498703, '280 Flanged Nitro Express Developed by Lancaster, the rimmed 280 cartridge is similar to the rimless 280 Ross and used in single shot and double rifles. It was introduced shortly after the Ross cartridge appeared, between 1910-15. It is another obsolete load, and no rifles are regularly made for it currently. It is said to have been a favorite with King George V.\r\n\r\nThe rimmed 280 is loaded slightly lower than the 280 Ross. When the rimless Ross cartridge was introduced in1910, it created considerable interest all over the world. It was only natural to bring out a rimmed version for the man who preferred the double rifle. Both cartridges are practically the same power and effectiveness. The 280 cartridges lost popularity after a few bi game hunters were killed while using them on heavy or dangerous game under adverse conditions. The rimmed 280 has not been used to any extent in the U.S., but would be a good cartridge for anything through elk.', ''),

The answer - maybe yes and maybe no.\n \nPowders used in modern firearms are rated in terms of the burn rate - how fast or how slow the powder burns. Ammunition manufacturers select appropriate powders to arrive at the cartridge properties to meet the manufacturer&#8217;s design criteria. Nowadays hyper-speed 22LR ammunition is available in the marketplace. Post #472 list popular ammunition offered by CCI, Federal, Remington and Winchester.

Hyper speed ammunition does offer flatter trajectory for shorter ranges, but at the expense of more wind drift due to lighter bullet.\n \nAmmunition velocity or bullet energy may not be your sole criteria in your selection process. You also need to take into account the fact that the selected ammunition may or may not be the most accurate in your rifle.', ''),

(498828, '280 Rimless (Ross) Designed by F.W. Jones, a consultant to Eley and Sir Chas. Ross and introduced in 1906 for the Canadian straight-pulll Ross rifles. This was one of the first modern high-velocity smalll-bore cartridges. It was originally a military design, but quickly caught the fancy of sportsmen because of the high velocity, flat trajectory and apparent fantastic killing power. The 280 Halgar Magnum is based on the Ross case. At one time, Remington and Winchester loaded the 280 Ross. American companies discontinued it about 1935.\r\n\r\nThe 280 Ross is a good example of what happens when hunters get overenthusiastic about something new before all the field data is assembled. It proved to have fantastic killing power on thin-skinned game, and even dangerous species were dispatched occasionally as if struck by lightning. However, there is big difference between killing dangerous game under ideal conditions and stopping them cold to find this out the 280 Ross hit the skids. Some say it was poor bullet design that caused all the trouble as the original Ross bullet was made to expand quickly on medium-sized game. Undoubtedly, there is some truth in this because no one bullet weight or type will do all the things. Other cartridges besides the Ross have been maligned because someone used them on game or under conditions they weren''t designed for, The 280 Ross is certainly adequate for most North American game and non-dangerous African plains varieties if you select the proper bullet for the job. The early straight-pull Ross rifles gained a bad reputation because they could be assembled incorrectly and dangerously. Some users were injured because of this. Sir Chas. Ross reported velocities over 3000 fps with the 180-grain bullet.', ''),

(498890, '9mm Wincester Magnum Reports on the 9mm Winchester Magnum were circulating as early as 1977, but 11 years later, in late 1988, it was still not exactly an over-the-counter item, although a few individuals were using it in Thompson/Center pistols. The cartridge is listed in the 1988 Winchester-Western Sporting Arms and Ammunition Catalog. In any event, the 9mm Magnum is one of two cartridges developed by Winchester for the stainless steel Wildey gas-operated semi-automatic pistol. This is another rather large handgun weighing over 3 pounds, unloaded, and holding 14 of the 9mm Magnum rounds. It was advertised as available in 5-, 6-, 7-, 8- or 10-inch barrel lengths and has a ventilated, raised rib over the barrel and an adjustable target-type rear sight. The pistol and cartridge are intended primarily for silhouette competition, but have an obvious field application for hunting small to medium game, or big game in the hands of an expert. \r\n\r\nThe 9mm Winchester Magnum bears some resemblance to the older 9mm Mauser cartridge and develops roughly comparable ballistics. The Mauser 9mm fires a 128-grain bullet at 1362 fps whereas the Winchester version has a 115-grain bullet that starts out at 1475 fps. The energies developed are 534 and 556 pounds respectively, so they are not really very far apart. A 115-grain bullet with a muzzle velocity of 1475 fps (5-inch barrel) is impressive, but no more so than some handloads in the 357 Magnum which can develop over 1550 fps with a 125-grain bullet. The 9mm Magnum is certainly more powerful than either the 9mm Luger or the 38 Colt Super and, if loaded with hunting-type bullets, should prove to be very effective for a broad range of hunting situations.', ''),

(498893, '300 (295) Rook Rifle Another of the small British Rook cartridges, this one is of rather obscure origin and use. It probably dates back to the 1880s and was originally a black-powder cartridge. It was used in single shot rifles and possibly pistols or revolvers. It was listed in the 1962 Eley-Kynoch catalog, so it must have had a degree of popularity. In the U.S., it is something for collectors.\r\n\r\nAside from the bullet diameter, the 300 Rook Rifle closely resembles the obsolete American 32 Extra Long, center fire. The case is a little shorter than the 32 Extra Long, and it would probably be possible to fire 300 Rook cartridges in old rifles for the American cartridge. This might interest owners of old Ballard or Stevens rifles. The 300 is strictly a small game or target number.', ''),
(498894, '380 Revolver The 380 Revolver cartridge is a British innovation for the Webley revolver and originated about 1868-70. It was loaded in the U.S. until shortly after WWI and is still manufactured in Europe and England. The 38 Short Colt was copied from it, and most 380 revolvers will accept the Colt version. It has been largely replaced by the inside-lubricated 38 S&W.\r\n\r\nThe 380 is in the same class as the 38 Short Colt or 38 S&W, and the same loading data can be seen and observed for additional information.', ''),

(498953, ' 22LR - Crack Shot\n \nAt the range you amaze onlookers with your 22LR rifle shooting skills. Yes, you have been called a crack shot. You are a gun savvy guy - a gun guru.\n \nA friend of yours is not much of a paper-target shooter He invites you to go rabbit hunting with him. Your experience in field hunting is next to zero. You friend persists and you agree. Your weapon of choice is the highly refined 22LR with iron sights that has earned you many rewards. You know the behavior your prized rifle like you know the behavior of your young son.\n \nFrom prior talks, you learned that the only weapon your friend has is a 22LR rifle. It was passed down from grandfather to son and from son to grandson. Your friend is that grandson who has tendered the hunting invitation.\n \nSince it was your friend&#8217;s invitation, he comes to your house in his car to pick you up. You put a hard case on the back seat of the car. In the case is your 22LR rifle. When you reach your hunting destination, you take out your rifle from the hard case. Your friend pulls out a rusty-looking rifle from the back of the car. You notice that your friend&#8217;s rifle was not in a case - hard or soft. You take a quick glance at your friend&#8217;s rifle. It looks all beat-up with iron sights. The bluing appears almost all gone. The wood stock has lots of dings. You judge that rifle to be half century old, more likely much older.\n \nYou have been walking the fields for about an hour. Your friend spots a rabbit in the distance and motions you to take aim. The rabbit is still. You take your time to aim, like you do at the range and pull the trigger. You miss. Hearing the rifle shot, the rabbit jumps and is now even farther from both of you. Now it is your friend&#8217;s turn. He takes quick aim and brings down the rabbit. This scene is repeated once more - you miss and your friend bags the game.\n \nAll the walking in the fields got you tired. You call it quits and head toward the car with your friend beside you - carrying the two rabbits that he shot. As you slump in the front passenger seat, feeling dejected and ego deflated, your head starts spinning. You are wondering how your friend nailed the two rabbits and you did not.  \n \nYour friend stops his car in front of your house. You take out your gun case from the back seat. While you are doing this, your friend goes to back of the car and take out one of the two rabbits that he had shot. He hands you that rabbit and you head toward the front door of your house. Now you have another equation in your head. As you bring the rabbit in, your family is going to assume that you shot that rabbit. You are asking yourself, &#8220;should I say something&#8221; or &#8220;should I say nothing&#8221;.\n \nLater, after some deep thinking, you start to admit your failing and start to admire you friend&#8217;s skill in the field. You come to realize that marksmanship at the range may not necessarily be directly translatable in the field. Weeks passed. You swallow your pride and built up the courage to ask your friend for pointers. He was more than happy to pass on what he knew. Your friend was seeking a hunting partner. Now he found one - you. What better way to enjoy this sport, than to share cumulative knowledge with a fellow hobbyist.\n \n \n.', ''),

Ammo is VERY reasonable considering its a MAGNUM round with a velocity of over 2000 fps.... So it DOES have the knock down power.  Its fun to fire, ever fire one?  I strongly suggest those who haven''t - go and fire one to become a believer.\n4.  Its basically SLIGHT (i said SLIGHT... for those who don''t know the meaning of SLIGHT, please look it up in the dictionary) lower build copy of the Para Ordnance P18-9.\n5.  The Philippine stuff is by no means the best but they too have been around longer than our Turkish counterparts.\n6.  Should it be available in single stack... Yes, would be nice.  I am gonna make mine that way... \n7.  As for the 9mm, well its the most popular caliber in the world and being that the company is out to do business WORLDWIDE, I don''t think they care too much about making it in .45 UNLESS the biggest market in the world - US shows interest in it.  Till then we do with the 9mm, though I don''t think any of the TCM owners have fired it in that caliber... because they are having waaay too much fun with the TCM.\n8.  A reminder to all those who love the .45acp round, it was available ages ago here in Pakistan.  Then it disappeared, now its available, question is for how long.  This is the main reason I don''t own a 45.\n9.  Lastly, Asif Ali & Asd1976 - ++++++1', ''),

(499018, ' What types of disaster might you face?  If you live on a hill you can rule out floods.  If you live in a quiet residential area you can probably rule out industrial chemical spills.  If you live in a wooded area you need to think about fire.  And so forth.\r\n\r\nAre you more likely to bug out TO some specific place, or will you be getting back home FROM some place, probably work? \r\n\r\nFigure in any major disaster everyone else will be trying to go somewhere... before the authorities start barricading the roads "to maintain order" and "to prevent looting."  Unless you can get past the line before they close things down, a car might not be worth much.\r\n\r\n If you''re walking, detailed maps are your friend.  In Britain, they''re called Ordnance Survey maps.  In the USA, they''re US Geological Survey maps.  I don''t know what they''re called in Pakistan, but I''m sure they exist.  Maybe there''s a smartphone app that can give you the kind of detailed information those maps give, but the maps don''t depend on batteries or being near a cell tower.\r\n\r\n Why not just follow the roads?  Because that''s where everyone else is likely to be, in your way or as a potential problem.  Plus you can pick and choose between alternate routes, find creeks or lakes where you might get water, etc.\r\n\r\n You need a set of good boots or hiking shoes.  Ones that are broken in, that won''t wear blisters on your feet.\r\n\r\n You need warm clothing if you''re where it is cold.  You need a hat and some sunblocker if it''s not.  You need water.  You need a *good* flashlight; that means waterproof.  It doesn''t have to be super bright, have an adjustable lens, or four different colors; it just needs to work in the rain and last (or you should have enough batteries for) an eight to ten hour night.\r\n\r\n Those are your basics.  Mobility, a map to guide you, appropriate clothing so as not to freeze or have heat stroke, a light so you can continue in the dark. \r\n\r\n EVERYTHING else is a luxury; guns, ammunition, first aid kit, or food won''t do you much good if you''re not mobile.\r\n\r\n Pick those luxuries wisely.  Because if you pick too much, you''ll have to abandon some of it.\r\n\r\n I''ve seen pictures of "bug out bags" that probably weigh over 50 kilograms.  Maybe someone with the physical condition of a Special Forces soldier can do a long march with one of those, but most of us would have to tow it behind us in a little red wagon.  It''s way too easy to buy a big bag and stuff it full of everything you might need.  The critical part is deciding what you can do without.', ''),

(499066, '38 Long Colt Although obsolete for many years, the 38 Long Colt was once the official U.S. Army revolver cartridge, from 1892 to 1911. It was used mainly in the Colt Army & Navy Model revolver, with a swing-out cylinder developed in 1887. The 38 Long Colt was actually introduced in 1875 as one of several calibers of the Colt New Line, New Police and New House revolvers. There is also a short version that is identical except for case length (.762-inch) and the fact that it used a 130-grain, outside-lubricated bullet at the same 770 fps muzzle velocity.\r\n\r\nSince this was once a military cartridge, a number of Colt and S&W revolvers are still around in this caliber. The 38 Long Colt cartridge can be fired in a 38 Special revolver, but not vice versa. During the Spanish-American War and the Philippine insurrection, the Army found that the 38 Long Colt had insufficient stopping power for combat use. The cartridge was therefore dropped, in 1911, in favor of the 45 ACP. It is this same experience that made the U.S. Army reluctant to adopt the 9mm Luger which they eventually did anyway, in 1985, largely as a NATO-inspired political decision. Advocates of a smaller caliber admit the superior stopping power of the 45, but point out that extra weight, reduced magazine capacity, detrimental factors that should be considered. The 38 Long Colt is in about the same class as the standard 38 Special load, but not nearly as accurate or as versatile. Some of the old 38 Long Colt revolvers will accept 38 Special or 357 Magnum ammunition but never fire these in the old 38s. Firing the 357 Magnum would be particularly dangerous, probably wrecking the gun and possibly injuring the shooter or bystanders.', ''),

(499091, '38 Smith &amp; Wesson Designed by Smith & Wesson for their hinged-frame revolvers introduced about 1877, the 38 S&W is one of the more widely adopted American revolver cartridges; it has been used all over the world. England began using it as an official service cartridge prior to WWII, and it is rather well-distributed through the British Commonwealth. Large numbers of Spanish-made revolvers in this caliber are use in Mexico and South America, but it has never been very popular in Europe. It is also known as the 38 Colt New Police, and with a 200-grain bullet as the 38 Super Police. Colt, H&R, Hopkins & Allen, Iver Johnson and S&W have made revolvers of this caliber in the U.S. Webley & Scott made many of the British service arms. The British load is called the 380/200.\r\n\r\nThe 38 S&W is another cartridge that owes most of its popularity to the fact it is well-suited to lightweight pocket guns. It is also good short-range cartridge for defense use and has better stopping power than any of the 32s and even some of the larger automatic pistol cartridges. The British figured out that the shocking power of this cartridge with a 200-grain bullet was about the same as their older 455 military cartridge. In actual combat this proved correct, thus permitted the use of lighter weapons. The 38 S&W is not a particularly satisfactory hunting cartridge because the curved trajectory limits its use to short ranges. However, it can be improved for hunting by hand-loading.', ''),

I was out of paper targets and really wanted to shoot the gun, because it was a lovely day. So made my own. Baiscally i just wanted to see what''s the difference shooting with the kit and without the kit. So i shot the gun with and without at the same distance. here are the pics you decide which one is better. Remember it was my first time shooting the gun with the kit. \n\nFirst five shots, Chinese ammo, Withoout Kit, Distance 15M.\n\nNow with the Kit, \n\nThe bullet holes with X''s are the ones with the kit. Cicle ones are without.\n\nThe Taget area on the chest was getting bit crowded so try to shoot the head area from 25M with the kit. Here is the result\n\nOnly managed to get 3 shots on the Target. Have no idea where other two bullets went lols. \n\nDisappointed with the results i got bit pissed off and shot from 15M again without the kit at the head area. \n\nHowz that for a group! Guess i shoot better when i''m ticked off ;). BTW this group is marked with a triangle. \n\nSo is the Tactical Kit just a gimmick? Maybe maybe not. I''ll have to shoot it more with the Kit, i guess.

(499144, ' [QUOTE=TRX;337133]What types of disaster might you face?  If you live on a hill you can rule out floods.  If you live in a quiet residential area you can probably rule out industrial chemical spills.  If you live in a wooded area you need to think about fire.  And so forth.\n\nAre you more likely to bug out TO some specific place, or will you be getting back home FROM some place, probably work? \n\nFigure in any major disaster everyone else will be trying to go somewhere... before the authorities start barricading the roads "to maintain order" and "to prevent looting."  Unless you can get past the line before they close things down, a car might not be worth much.\n\n If you''re walking, detailed maps are your friend.  In Britain, they''re called Ordnance Survey maps.  In the USA, they''re US Geological Survey maps.  I don''t know what they''re called in Pakistan, but I''m sure they exist.  Maybe there''s a smartphone app that can give you the kind of detailed information those maps give, but the maps don''t depend on batteries or being near a cell tower.\n\n Why not just follow the roads?  Because that''s where everyone else is likely to be, in your way or as a potential problem.  Plus you can pick and choose between alternate routes, find creeks or lakes where you might get water, etc.\n\n You need a set of good boots or hiking shoes.  Ones that are broken in, that won''t wear blisters on your feet.\n\n You need warm clothing if you''re where it is cold.  You need a hat and some sunblocker if it''s not.  You need water.  You need a *good* flashlight; that means waterproof.  It doesn''t have to be super bright, have an adjustable lens, or four different colors; it just needs to work in the rain and last (or you should have enough batteries for) an eight to ten hour night.\n\n Those are your basics.  Mobility, a map to guide you, appropriate clothing so as not to freeze or have heat stroke, a light so you can continue in the dark. \n\n EVERYTHING else is a luxury; guns, ammunition, first aid kit, or food won''t do you much good if you''re not mobile.\n\n Pick those luxuries wisely.  Because if you pick too much, you''ll have to abandon some of it.\n\n I''ve seen pictures of "bug out bags" that probably weigh over 50 kilograms.  Maybe someone with the physical condition of a Special Forces soldier can do a long march with one of those, but most of us would have to tow it behind us in a little red wagon.  It''s way too easy to buy a big bag and stuff it full of everything you might need.

In the U.S. only Colt used it; in England, Webley & Scott chambered it in one version of their military automatic and in Spain a number of automatics have been made for it.\r\n\r\nAlthough developed for military or self-defense use, the 38 Colt auto achieved a degree of popularity for sporting use through its relatively high velocity.

(499173, ' 22LR - Pull Trigger & Hear Thud - Possible Entry in Danger Zone\n \nWhat propels a bullet? Gunpowder. When gunpowder is ignited in a cartridge, it results in pressure buildup. Since the cartridge is encased in the chamber of the rifle, the pressure will overcome resistance of the bullet at rest and propel it on its ways toward the intended target.\n \nIf the pressure is insufficient, the bullet may not move at all or may move a short distance within the barrel and not exit. This situation can come about if there is no powder in the cartridge or if the cartridge has less than the required amount in it. In this case you may have entered the danger zone. If the pressure in the cartridge is not sufficient to propel the bullet, possibility exists that the cartridge case may burst and expel hot gasses near the shooter’s face.\n \nIf you pull the trigger and hear a thud, instead of the normal sound of a bullet leaving the barrel, be very safety conscious. Keeping your ears “tuned” can keep you out of such danger. Before you fire another cartridge, ascertain that the barrel is clear and that a bullet is not stuck within. Firing a cartridge behind a bullet that still lodged in the barrel is an open invitation to trouble.\n \nModern day high-speed loading equipment can fail. A given cartridge may skip the powder loading stage or the process may put insufficient powder in the cartridge. High-speed loading equipment can also fail and load 22LR cartridges with double power charge. Such was a case when Winchester issued a recall notice for 22LR ammunition.  You can read the recall notice at the end of this post.\n \nChamber pressure in firearms is of such importance that an organization  (SAAMI - Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute) has set maximum chamber pressure limits - 24,00 pound per square inch for the 22 long rifle cartridge. Modern 22LR rifles are designed to abide by this limit. Failure of loading equipment, like in the case of Wincher 22LR ammunition recall, can bring about chamber pressure that exceeds the recommended limits resulting in possible personal injury or damage to the firearm.\n\n -----------------------------------------------------------\n[TABLE="width: 92%"]\n[TR]\n[TD]PRODUCT WARNING AND RECALL NOTICE: \nWINCHESTER WILDCAT 22 & WINCHESTER XPERT 22\n4/6/2007\n\nOlin Corporation, through its Winchester Division, is recalling several lots of its WILDCAT 22 (Symbol Number WW22LR) and XPERT 22 (Symbol Number XPERT22) 22 Long Rifle rimfire ammunition. \n\nLot Numbers containing Letters: XN, YA, YB or YC\n\nThrough extensive evaluation Winchester has determined the above lots of WILDCAT 22 and XPERT 22 ammunition may contain double powder charges.

(499326, '303 British The 303 British military cartridge is also a popular sporting round throughout the British commonwealth. It  has been covered in detail under military cartridges and also listed with American sporting cartridges because it is loaded and used here. However, English and Canadian loads offered greater variety and performance than anything loaded in the U.s. It is listed here to include this data. Unfortunately, British-made sporting ammunition is no longer distributed in the U.S. and difficult to obtain except in a few large cities. However, Norma offers a load as well as unprimed cases. With British loads, the 303 is stepped up a good notch above our 30-40 Krag, with which it is often compared.', ''),
(499327, ' 22LR - Low or High Rifle Sight Mount?\n \nIs there any benefit in having a low or high rifle sight mount? Let us examine the flight path of the bullet.\n \nFor this discussion we are going to deploy a modern 22LR rifle. We will use this rifle twice. Once with sight at height of 0.75 inch (iron sight) above the bore and again with sight (scope) mounted at height of 1.75 inches above the bore. Since neither 1.75-inch height iron sight nor 0.75-inch height scope are readily available, we selected the given arrangement (iron sight at 0.75” and scope at 1.75”) for the sole purpose of determining if there is any trajectory difference between the low and high mounts. We will assume that the scope has no magnification - it has no lenses, only crosshairs.\n \nThe ammunition chosen is Winchester Super-X lead 37-grain hollow point (#X22LRH)) with muzzle velocity of 1,280 feet per second and ballistic coefficient (BC) of 0.128.\n \nFor our tests we set the following criteria. We want the bullet to go no higher and no lower than 0.75 inch from our aim point. What is the range in yards that the bullet will stay within our set limits?\n \nCartridge data was entered in an online ballistics calculator and various second zero-set distances were entered to attain the maximum range and still stay within +/- 0.75-inch criteria.\n \nHere are the key observations. The range in distance for the set criteria is essentially the same for sights of both heights. It is 50.7 yards (56.7-6.0=50.7) for the low mount and 50.6 yards (68.5-17.9=50.6) for high mount. First zero-set distance for the low mount is 14.0 yards and for the high mount it is 25.5 yards. Second zero-set distance for the low mount is 48.8 yard and for the high mount it is 60.8 yards.\n \nNow we are better prepared to decide if low or high mount sight meets our needs.\n \n \n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD]   Sight = 0.75”[/TD]\n[TD]     Sight = 1.75”[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Range[/TD]\n[TD]   6.0 – 56.7 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]   17.9 - 68.5 Yards[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]1[SUP]st[/SUP] Zero-Set[/TD]\n[TD]        14.0 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]       25.5 Yards[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]2nd Zero-Set[/TD]\n[TD]        48.8 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]       60.8 Yards[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD]Bullet Drop - Inch[/TD]\n[TD] Bullet Drop - Inch[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]@ Muzzle[/TD]\n[TD]       - 0.750[/TD]\n[TD]        -1.75[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]5 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.432[/TD]\n[TD]        -1.297[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]10[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.167[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.897[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]15[/TD]\n[TD]         0.044[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.552[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]20[/TD]\n[TD]         0.200[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.261[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]25[/TD]\n[TD]         0.301[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.025[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]30[/TD]\n[TD]         0.347[/TD]\n[TD] 0.155[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]35[/TD]\n[TD]         0.335[/TD]\n[TD] 0.279[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]40[/TD]\n[TD]         0.268[/TD]\n[TD] 0.345[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]45[/TD]\n[TD]         0.142[/TD]\n[TD] 0.355[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]50[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.041[/TD]\n[TD] 0.306[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]55[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.283[/TD]\n[TD] 0.199[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]60[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.585[/TD]\n[TD] 0.032[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]65[/TD]\n[TD]        -0.946[/TD]\n[TD]       -0.194[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]70[/TD]\n[TD]        -1.367[/TD]\n[TD]       -0.481[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]75[/TD]\n[TD]        -1.850[/TD]\n[TD]       -0.829[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]80[/TD]\n[TD]        -2.394[/TD]\n[TD]       -1.238[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]85[/TD]\n[TD]        -3.000[/TD]\n[TD]       -1.709[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]90[/TD]\n[TD]        -3.669[/TD]\n[TD]       -2.244[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]95[/TD]\n[TD]        -4.402[/TD]\n[TD]      -2.842[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]100[/TD]\n[TD]        -5.198[/TD]\n[TD]      -3.504[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nRelated posts\n\n#10    High Velocity Bullet Hits Target at 20 Yards and Again at 60 Yard\n# 475 Zero-Set Rifle for Two Different Distances at Same Time', ''),

(499269, 'Hunting in outskirts of Kohat (Jan 25, 2013) Gentlemen\nI and my friends went to the outskirts of Kohat for our last hunt of the season of Teetar (Gray & Black). We started our session at about 11:00am. Its totally not the right time to kickoff the hunt for Teeter. The ideal timing is to set off at about 7:30 in the morning. These birds are quite active in early morning hours and are on a feeding-frenzy, lol, so thats the real fun-time. :)  \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]17967[/ATTACH]\n\nIt was the first time that I got to hunt with a Pointer. Our mutt was named "Cimy" (a strange name for a dog. right???) Cimy was about 8 years old and I felt that the poor thing had seen its days. The owner mentioned that its the last season for this K9 as it will be retiring soon and from next year we shall have another companion for Teetar hunts. However, I believe that Cimy outdid himself and was really excited to be out in open fields.  \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]17968[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]17969[/ATTACH]\n\nIn these bushes we found two birds and were able to bag one. Due the vastness of the terrain, presence of a mutt for these hunts is a must as the area can not be swept with manpower only.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]17970[/ATTACH]\n\nOne of our local host accompanying us and also providing intel on presence of Teetar in the area.  \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]17971[/ATTACH]\n\nOur local host who is a teacher in the village''s primary school and is a seasoned hunter himself, had a cute little darling angel. This sweet little darling was very excited to see Cimy and tried her level best to annoy the old chap as much as she could. lol \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]17972[/ATTACH]\n\nOur first day''s hunt consisted of 5 gray Francolins and 2 black. One of these 2 black Teetar got shot in the right eye with a single pellet and was completely disoriented (Its not visible in the first picture). One of our hunting partner thought that the poor thing will survive so we didnt put it under the knife.    \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]17973[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]17974[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]17975[/ATTACH]\n\nHowever later on we came to the conclusion that it might suffer unnecessarily and was put to rest. The last picture of our second Black Francolin. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]17976[/ATTACH]\n\nWe stayed the night in Kohat and started our second session the next day; so there is more to come :).

Yup! it was was Baikal MP-155 for which we drove some 200km non-stop.\r\n\r\nAll of us rushed to the cabinet because everybody wanted to be the first the get their hands on it. I don''t know why but to be honest even I wanted to be first to hold it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I picked it up when my turn came (civilized bunch, don''t you think?). Three things immediately came to my attention. its lightweight around 7lbs, better balanced and the finishing has truly gone south for the winter. lols!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnyhow, everything in that particular piece was out of spec. the rib was not straight and the trigger had too much play. not to mention that the whole thing was rattling like a bottle of pills. Among many other slips, the safety button too wasn''t engaging (and disengaging) like it should. something didn''t feel right but like any die-hard Baikal aficionados, we decided that we must pick one up even if it means flushing the pay-check down the toilet.\r\n\r\nSo.....we explained our eagerness to the dealer and he gladly agreed to let us in his store where we assembled like 30 pieces or so only to get the one that had the best of everything. boy! were we surprised or what? things were seriously wrong in almost all of them. either their ribs did not run true, the barrels were not straight (literally!), faulty trigger, bolt release buttons didn''t work, choke tubes were not truly centered in the bore (off center choke tubes) or there were serious manufacturing flaws that we noticed while assembling them. in one particular piece, aluminum powder was falling off from inside the receiver. upon closer look we noticed the bolt rubbing against the wall of the receiver. imagine that!\r\n\r\nSince we just had to buy one, we picked the one that was reasonably free from flaws. this particular piece also had the most smooth action when we racked the bolt.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nMoving on.... the grain is pretty decent in this one. wood to metal finish leaves a lot to be desired. Rubber recoil pad is soft and it seems that its made to mimic the look of Beretta''s kick-off mechanism however its just rubber covered plastic housing inside a hollowed out butt. this setup isn''t appealing to me as it cannot be altered to increase/decrease the length of pull if desired. plus the hollowing out of the buttstock means we cannot install adjustable comb kits on it. bummer!\r\n\r\nBaikal has incorporated shim system in this one that means we can alter the cast and drop to our liking. the shim goes between the receiver and butt stock. what I didn''t like about this setup was that unlike other shotguns, shims stand out too much. it doesn''t exactly blend in. Anyways, it gets the job done, I can learn to live with it.\r\n\r\nThe safety button is huge. good move by Baikal but it doesn''t exactly behave like it should. there is too much play in it. when it comes to buttons, I like those that sharply click in and out (or on and off) like a button should. \r\n\r\nThe trigger on this one behaved well. there is very little trigger travel which is an improvement I''ll give you that but every time I pressed the trigger the bolt or something moved inside the receiver. not necessarily a problem but I don''t like unnecessary movements.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe receiver on this 76mm (3inch) chambered shotgun is definitely shortened which is good. it improved balance and handling over its predecessor Baikal MP-153. the wooden forend extends over the receiver which may look good in pictures but in reality is nothing short of absolutely disgusting. the trigger guard is nicely shaped. plenty of room for gloved finger in there. same is the case with the cartridge release, huge button makes it easy to operate.\r\n\r\nThe stepped-up arch type rib is clearly visible in the picture. which is also great in my humble opinion however its a big turn off the moment you see brazing joints under each and every post. this is truly sloppy metal work cause even Darra guys have learned to hide and in some cases avoid brazing work as it ruins the looks of a firearm.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic6.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI also didn''t like the forend style. curves are always welcomed but the way forend nut interacts with the forend leaves a lot to be desired in terms of durability. I used almost every ounce of energy in me to tighten the nut but still couldn''t get the forend to stop rattling on this un-used gun. good news for those who like mag extenders cause its the same thread therefore MP-153''s extenders should work on MP-155 as well.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic7.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnybody with a sharp eye can see that the barrel and rib though straight isn''t finished right. plus I don''t like barrels that open up at the muzzle like a blunderbuss. I guess the barrel is intentionally thinned to shed weight but the muzzle is kept the same to accommodate threads for the choke tubes. The barrel bore profile is the same as MP-153 and carries similar proof marks. not proofed for steel shot though.\r\n\r\nA dovetail is machined on the receiver for those who like to install optics. frankly speaking I don''t know why would somebody install scopes and aiming devices on a shotgun.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis out of focus picture clearly shows typical Baikal fashion tiny brass front bead and sloppy metal work as one can still see brazing joints under the rib.....and....whats with the tapering of the rib at the muzzle? I don''t know but to me it looks like a Russian version of a bad joke. lols!\r\n\r\nThe extended colonial arms choke tube was installed to show that the choke threads are same as Baikal MP-153. thats definitely a good news for aftermarket choke tube users as any Tru-choke type choke from Trulock or Colonial Arms will work.\r\n\r\nThis gun however was supplied with a cylinder choke, an improved modified and a full choke. pretty odd combination of choke tubes don''t you think? is this me or I am starting to get the hang of Russian humor?\r\n\r\nand No!... we checked them all. the whole inventory of Baikal MP-155s at Fakhr-e-Alam and Sons had the same funny three choke combination.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic9.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nHere is another look.

(499277, ' [IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic13.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nDual extractors just like MP-153 for positive extraction. the bolt assembly is almost identical. similar dual action bars.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic14.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThats a magazine cut-off switch/lever that converts Baikal MP-155 into a single shot. funny thing about this lever: of all we checked at Fakr-e-Alam, almost all had some sort of a problem. this one as well is a bit too soft for comfort. one, it doesn''t positively click into place due to the extension of the forend. secondly, this thing trips on and off just on recoil and third, its only held by a screw and in my limited experience, screws on something that shakes rarely stay in its place.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic15.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThats a picture of a pristine action. never used and shining like a mirror. this setup of having the gas adjustment spring out of the cylinder and attached to the piston results in the advertised weight saving and a slimmer forend. Frankly speaking, I like this setup. its a lot easier to clean compared to MP-153. but.... then again... if i have decide between the ability to clean vs reliability, I''ll always go for reliability.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic16.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic17.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI don''t know if this new setup over MP-153 is supposed to increase reliability or decrease it but we sure found that out. boy! what a surprise there.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic18.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nsome surprises literally make you blow a gasket. specially when your hard earned money is involved. lols!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic19.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis small little piece of spring steel holds the gas adjustment spring in its place. in a few pieces back at the shop this particular piece was either dented or broken altogether. don''t know if it matters but then again, broken or dented things make me uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic20.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic21.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe gun after being put through its paces. as Murphy''s law says "if something can break, it will". I can''t help but wonder what would happen if this thing ever breaks? I am talking about this small piece of spring steel that looks like a pistol''s extractor and holds the gas adjustment spring in place.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic22.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nwe brought the gun home. cleaned it up real good. lubed everything. took the gun to a range and tried it on skeet and trap. The first thing we noticed how crude the gun was in its operation.\r\n\r\nIn over 200 cartridges of various denominations that were fired that day, the gun failed to feed and eject on all of them. it was as if we were shooting a single shot. then the bolt got stuck a few times that we had to remove the forend and yank the whole mechanism a couple of times to get everything back to normal. the ejectors grabbed the shells so hard at couple of times that we had to use a screw driver to pry the shells out.\r\n\r\nsame was the case with the safety, either it wasn''t engaging or it refused to disengage. it was nothing less than absolutely pathetic. we were not getting any love from this shotgun, that was for sure.\r\n\r\ncouldn''t get the shells into the magazine tube as well. the opening was so tight and roughly bored that it was scratching the operator''s thumb and the shell''s body. even the receiver opening (ejection port) was giving us a hard time as it was barely wide enough to manually throw a cartridge in and slam the bolt forward. a slightly enlarged ejection port would definitely help.\r\n\r\nI mean, we tried everything but could not get this monstrosity to work properly. its understandable for a new gun to not eject properly. A new action usually requires a break-in for all parts to settle in properly but this wasn''t the case here. the bolt wasn''t even moving after firing.\r\n\r\nUsually a gun that requires break-in atleast tries to eject or shows some willingness by moving the bolt back a little bit upon firing. on this one, the bolt was at times stuck so bad that we had to disassemble the whole thing to take out the fired cartridge...and....No! it wasn''t the magazine cut-off lever.\r\n\r\nas far as reliability is concerned, the gun totally failed on us. she couldn''t cycle anything from 24g skeet and trap loads to No. 8 regular hunting loads. it was an absolute disaster.\r\n\r\ngiven the performance (or lack of) of the gun we decided to skip pattern testing. whats the point? right?\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic23.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]End Result:[/B]\r\n\r\nI guess, Baikal here focused more on looks and reducing weight than anything else. the production quality which is falling day by day really fell in this one. even today, you can find Baikal MP-153 still better finished than this newly introduced MP-155. I guess, its probably due to the maturity of the manufacturing/production process. Baikal has been producing MP-153 for over 10 years now and it has gotten to a point that even a vodka influenced worker can churn out a reasonable part.\r\n\r\nThis gun quiet successfully proved that an apple can fall far from tree and to be honest, there are much better ways to flush your money down the drain. 54K to be precise.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-155%20Review/Pic24.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]Final Thought:[/B]\r\n\r\nThe overall upgrades compared to Baikal MP-153 do have the potential for success but we need to wait a couple of years before the design and the manufacturing process matures/settles down enough to produce consistent and dependable quality.\r\n\r\nwhen a design ages, it matures, flaws are removed, things are made better as alternate solutions are exploited. weak parts are changed with stronger parts, fragile solutions are replaced by durable solutions as field reports and feedback come in.\r\n\r\nTherefore Baikal MP-155 has a lot to prove before we can compare it to MP-153. even the venerated MP-153 went through quiet many changes before settling down.\r\n\r\nStick with the tried and tested Baikal MP-153 for the next couple of years or wait till the big players such as EAA jump in. As history tells us that Baikal MP-153 became what it is today only after Remington and EAA came on board.\r\n\r\n[B]As for this particular MP-155, its going back to the dealer for an exchange with the good old MP-153.[/B]\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(499335, '38 Colt Super Automatic Introduced by Colt in 1929 as an improved version of the older 38 Auto. The Super Auto is identical to the original cartridge except it uses a more powerful loading and has a higher velocity. It''s a fine high-speed sporting cartridge for the it proved Government Model automatic pistol, but it should not be used in the older Colt pocket models. In the U.S. only the Colt uses it, although the Thompson sub-machine gun was once available in a 38 super caliber. In Spain, Llama makes pistols for it. It is not popular in Europe, but is used in Canada, Mexico and South America.\r\n\r\nThis was for many years the most powerful automatic pistol cartridge mad e in the United States from the standpoint of velocity and energy. It makes a good sporting cartridge for hunting small to medium range because the flat trajectory permits accurate long-range shots. However, the metal case bullet used does not bring out the full potential of this round. With a good expanding-type bullet, it is one of our better hunting cartridges. It is more powerful than the 9mm Luger, but both are adequate for about the same range of game. It will give greater penetration than the 45 ACP. But is inferior in stopping power for defense use. For hand-loading, any 38 Special lead bullet can be used if sized .355- to .356-inch and round-nosed or conical shapes are used, it will be necessary to single load most lead bullets. Jacketed soft-point bullets for the 9mm Luger work fine in the 38 Super.', ''),

(499533, '9.8mm Automatic Colt This cartridge is also known as the 9.8 Colt Auto Pistol and was developed by Colt in 1912, probably for the Model 1911 pistol. It was understood by some others that this was part of an effort to secure a contract with the Romanian government whose military didn''t like the 45 ACP. In any event, the Romanians opted for the 9mm Steyr Model 1912 automatic pistol produced in Austria. Only a very few Colt pistols in the 9.8mm caliber were ever made, and the cartridge was not introduced in this country. However, an identical cartridge appears to have been produced in Belgium, listed as the 9.65mm Browning Automatic Pistol. American cartridges are head-stamped WRA and were manufactured by Winchester; the Belgian are marked F.N.\r\n\r\nThe 9.8mm Colt is true 38-caliber with a bullet diameter that varies from .378- to .381-inch and weighs 230-grain. Actually ballistics are not available at this time, but the muzzle velocity have been in excess of 1000fps which have made a fairly good military and self-defense cartridge. With all the new handgun cartridges that have been appeared formerly in those days, some shooters wonder why someone hasn''t latched onto this design? Increase the bullet weight to 140 grains and start it out at 1250 fps and you would have a great self-defense and field cartridge.', ''),

(499577, ' 22LR - Effective Range\n \nA common asked question about the 22LR cartridge is the effective range. Let us first define what is meant by effective range. Here is one definition - &#8220;the farthest range to which a projectile can be expected to retain sufficient energy to perform its intended function". What do you want the 22LR to do? \n \nEnergy of a projectile (bullet/pellet) is usually given in foot-pounds (or Newton-meters in metric measure) at a give distance. We will use medium power and high power spring air rifles as our reference points, and compare their knockdown power with that of a 22LR rifle cartridge\n \nWe know from first-hand knowledge or hearsay that a spring air rifle has the killing power for animals and birds listed below at the given distances. We will determine the distances at which a 22LR can deliver the same knockdown power. For comparison, kinetic energy data is shown up to 1,000 yards. The ballistic calculator used is limited to that range.\n \nFor this comparison we will use two air rifles. Diana model 34 in .177 caliber with Crosman Premier domed 7.9-grain pellet (ballistic coefficient 0.027) has muzzle velocity of 732 feet per second. Diana model 350 in .22 caliber with Crosman Premier domed 14.3-grain pellet (ballistic coefficient 0.027) had muzzle velocity of 786 feet per second. For the 22LR cartridge we use the CCI 40-grain Mini-Mag (#0030, ballistic coefficient 0.128) and has muzzle velocity of 1,235 feet per second.\n \nDiana 34 can kill a rabbit at 25 yards and Diana 350 at 50 yards. The 22LR can kill that same rabbit beyond 1,000 yards. Distance of 1,000 yards equates to almost one kilometer. Due to the huge bullet drop-off at that extreme distance, the ability to aim a 22LR accurately is almost next to impossible.\n  \nLet us look at it another way. The 22LR has about double the energy (39 f-p) at 500 yards than the Diana 350 high power air rifle delivers (20 f-P) at the muzzle. \n\nTo answer the question - what is the effective range of the 22LR? What do you want to kill - a rabbit, a dove? What do you have in mind?  Next time before one raises such a question - be prepared to tell what is your intended function.\n \n \n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]Make\nModel/Type[/TD]\n[TD] Diana\n    34[/TD]\n[TD]Diana\n  350[/TD]\n[TD]    CCI\nMini-Mag[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Caliber[/TD]\n[TD]  .177[/TD]\n[TD]  .22[/TD]\n[TD]  .22 LR[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Projectile Weight (grains)[/TD]\n[TD] 10.5[/TD]\n[TD]   14.3[/TD]\n[TD]         40.0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Muzzle Velocity[/TD]\n[TD]   732[/TD]\n[TD]    786[/TD]\n[TD]       1,235[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Ballistic Coefficient[/TD]\n[TD]   0.027[/TD]\n[TD]0.019[/TD]\n[TD]      0.128[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Energy - Muzzle[/TD]\n[TD]     12[/TD]\n[TD]  20[/TD]\n[TD]       135.5[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Energy - 25 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]     10[/TD]\n[TD]  14[/TD]\n[TD]       118[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Energy - 50 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]       8[/TD]\n[TD]  10[/TD]\n[TD]       106[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Energy - 100 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]       5[/TD]\n[TD]    5[/TD]\n[TD]         88[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Energy - 250 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]       1[/TD]\n[TD]    1[/TD]\n[TD]         62[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Energy - 500 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]       0[/TD]\n[TD]    0[/TD]\n[TD]         39[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Energy - 1,000 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]       0[/TD]\n[TD]    0[/TD]\n[TD]         17+ *[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Kill Rabbit (10 f-p) Yards[/TD]\n[TD]     25 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]  50 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]    1,000+ Yards *[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Kill Dove (5 f-p) Yards[/TD]\n[TD]   100 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]100 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]    1,000+ Yards *[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n \nVelocity - Feet per Second\nEnergy - Foot-Pounds\n* Ballistic Calculator Range Limited to 1,000 Yards', ''),

(499604, '310 Cadet Rifle This cartridge, also known as the 310 Greener, was introduced by Greener in 1900 as a target round for the small Martini sporting and training rifles. Many were made for the Australian government as cadet rifles. It also became a popular sporting caliber for small game shooting. Thousands of the Australian Martini cadet rifles were imported into the U.S. after WWII. The 310 cartridge is rather well known as a result, although few here ever heard of it before the war.\r\n\r\nThe 310 Cadet cartridge is similar in size and performance to the 32-20. In fact, 310 ammo can be made from 32-20 cases and many 310 rifles will accept the 32-20 cartridge without alteration. The reverse is also true in that 32-20 rifles and revolvers will often accept the British round. Bullet diameter is not exactly the same, but a difference of .005-inch isn''t enough to make any difference in cartridges of this power. Winfield Arms Co. (Los Angeles, California) and Klein''s Sporting Goods of Chicago sold several hundred 310 Martini rifles and actions. According to a 1955 data circular, these actions were tested with proof loads of up to 60,000 psi in order to determine what range of cartridges they would be safe with. Some were re-chambered for the 32 Winchester Special, others were re-bored to 357 Magnum. Quite a few have been reported re-barreled to 22 Hornet and 218 Bee. The 310 Cadet cartridge is a good small game and pest number at moderate ranges. It also makes a very accurate target round.', '');

(499619, ' A Glasgow lawyer went duck hunting in rural Aberdeenshire. He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer''s field on the other side of a fence.\r\n\r\nAs the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, "I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I''m going to retrieve it."\r\n\r\nThe old farmer Peter replied, "This is my property, and you are not coming over here."\r\n\r\nThe indignant lawyer said, "I am one of the best trial lawyers in Scotland and, if you don''t let me get that duck, I''ll sue you and take everything you own."\r\n\r\nThe old farmer smiled and said, "Apparently, you don''t know how we settle disputes in Mintlaw. We settle small disagreements like this with the ''Three Kick Rule.''\r\n\r\nThe lawyer asked, "What is the ''Three Kick Rule''?"\r\n\r\nThe Farmer replied, "Well, because the dispute occurs on my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up."\r\n\r\nThe lawyer quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom.\r\n\r\nThe old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel-toed work boot into the lawyer''s groin and dropped him to his knees!\r\n\r\nHis second kick to the midriff sent the lawyer''s last meal gushing from his mouth. The lawyer was on all fours when the farmer''s third kick to his rear end, sent him face-first into a fresh cow pie.\r\n\r\nSummoning every bit of his will and remaining strength the lawyer very slowly managed to get to his feet. Wiping his face with the arm of his jacket, he said, "Okay, you old fart. Now it''s my turn."\r\n\r\nThe old farmer smiled and said, "Nah, I give up.

(499686, 'Hard water adventure on Lake Simcoe on Saturday [COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande]Last week, weather was like deep freezer all over Canada. We were lucky to have temperatures around -25C to -20C with wind chills and it was hard for an outdoor person like me but good news was that lakes were freezing fast for safer ice fishing. The weekend temps were improving and all forums reported 8-10 inches of solid ice in Lake Simcoe perch grounds so I decided to book a nice warm propane heated hut on Port Bolster where perch bite was good in the last few days with a buddy.\nThe hut operations at Casey''s have been bought by Taj, a sikh sardar ji from India and operating well as the outfitter. The transportation was on Argo which is safe on water as well for travelling.\nHut was very warm so we had to get rid of extra warm clothing during fishing. We used slab grabbers, single/treble hooks with shiner minnows for perch fishing. The bite was consistent during whole day and we caught almost 50-60 perch in 25-27 ft of water but mostly 7-8 inchers which were released back. Increase in barometeric pressure somehow slowed bite from jumbos above 9-10 inch size due to our bad luck. Small ones were active all day and took the minnow the moment hook was close to the bottom.\nWe caught few jumbos and kept for dinner during a relaxing day and kept ourselves feasting with seeakh kebab rolls and hot tea made in desi style with shakaar...to stay warm.\nWill the Argo operator kept on visiting us during the day for any food/coffee/minnows so deserved a good tip after pick up at 4.00PM..and we headed home.\nI enjoyed my dinner of freshly caught perch after frying the fish marinated in crushed red peppers, salt, garlic, oil for 10 minutes..\nFor your information guys, perch meat tops in most surveys for being favourite in Canada!\nNext week, Bay of Quinte for fishing as ice is OK for fishing but walleye is not co-operating? Hopefully bite will improve?\nSome pictures for you guys on photobucket for sharing '' icefishing''\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande][COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande][URL="http://s1342.beta.photobucket.com/user/suuch_baat/library/?view=media#/user/suuch_baat/library/?&_suid=135934406416605569533550969293"]http://s1342.beta.photobucket.com/user/ ... 3550969293[/URL][/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[IMG]http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o773/suuch_baat/icefishing2013015_zps3e3db1e5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o773/suuch_baat/icefishing2013014_zpsda2065c1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o773/suuch_baat/icefishing2013010_zps4cf13fd3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o773/suuch_baat/icefishing2013012_zpsbd76bfd8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(499733, '10mm Auto (Bren Ten) The 10mm Auto was introduced in 1983 as the cartridge for the Bren Ten semi-auto pistol manufactured by the now-defunct Dornaus & Dixon Enterprises, Inc. of Huntington Beach, California. The ammunition is loaded by Norma and has a 200-grain full-jacketed bullet with a truncated cone shape, similar to some 9mm Luger and 45 ACP loads of some years back. According to data furnished by Norma, the ammunition is loaded to a mean working pressure of 37,000 psi with a maximum pressure of 44,000 psi plus or minus industry tolerance. This is getting up in the area of some rifle loads and makes this a pretty hot handgun cartridge. Muzzle velocity is listed as 1200 fps and energy at the muzzle as 635 fpe. This makes the cartridge more powerful than the 357 Magnum or the lead bullet police load of the 41 Magnum. The muzzle energy is about double that of the 45 ACP. The gun and cartridge are the brain children of Jeff Cooper and associates who are trying to develop the ideal combat weapon. Colt and several others now offer the 10mm chambering.\n\nThe Bren Ten semi-auto pistol is based on a modification of the much-praised Czech CZ-75 pistol design and has a 5-inch barrel, 11-shot magazine and weighs 39 ounces. It is a full-size combat-type pistol intended primarily for law enforcement/self-defense use.\nThe 10mm cartridge should be an ideal combat round with good stopping power, particularly with an expanding-type bullet. It would also be a good field cartridge for small to medium game or larger animals in the hands of a good shot and skilled hunter. The ammunition is quite expensive, somewhat that would discourage the average person from doing much shooting. All in all, the Bren Ten pistol and cartridge is an excellent concept for a combat handgun, and it reflects the extensive background and experience of Jeff Cooper.\nIn checking out Norma 10mm ammunition the bullet diameter is found .400-inch and the actual weight is 198.7-grains. The loaded cartridge weighs 288.4-grains, and the empty case with primer weighs 79.2-grains. The powder charge consist of 10.5 grains of a dark grey. very small, irregular length rod-type powder. Beside Norma, several other ammunition manufacturers are now offering 10mm auto ammo', ''),

Other gunmakers have also chambered bolt-action rifles for the round. It has been a very popular all-round cartridge with African hunters for any non-dangerous game.\r\n\r\nThe 318 can be used in standard-length bolt actions and fairly light rifles. This, combined with moderate recoil, is probably the reason for its popularity. The 318 case is very similar to the 30-06 in size, shape and capacity. The 30-06 can be loaded with250-grain bullets to duplicate the performance of the 318. The 180-grain bullet is used on lighter animals, but the 250-grain is preferred for heavy game. Bullet types were in solid, soft-point and the Westley Richards copper capped. The cartridge has been used with great success on North American big game. It is adequate for anything from deer on up. The .330-inch diameter bullets are not made by American bullet makers. However, .333-inch bullets could be swaged down and used.', ''),

No revolvers have chambered this cartridge about the early 1930s. There is also a 41 Short Colt that is identical except for case length (.65-inch) and the 160-grain bullet used. Both were originally black-powder cartridges using outside-lubricated bullets with a diameter of .410-inch. Smoke-less, inside-lubricated cartridges have hollow base bullets of .387-inch diameter.\r\n\r\nAlthough obsolete for a long time, the 41 Long Colt was for some years fairly popular. It is largely a short-range number with its slow, heavy bullet, but it has good stopping power. Its performance can be duplicated by using the 200-grain bullet in the 38 Special. It actually isn''t any more powerful than the 38 Special and, in addition, is not as accurate nor as versatile. It was never used to any event for hunting and would be good only at short range.

Mauser rifles made in Germany were also chambered for the round. This has always been a very popular medium bore for African and Asiatic big game.\r\n\r\nThe 333 Jeffery earned a fine reputed as a killer on all varieties of African big game, including elephant. However, most professional ivory hunters considered it on light side for such animals. It would kill elephant and buffalo all right with a well-placed shot, but was not always dependable under adverse conditions. On soft-skinned game it gave excellent penetration, particularly with the 300grain bullet. It is the inspiration for the wildcat 333 OKH designed by Elmer Keith. Performance of the two cartridges with ant given bullet weight is about the same. It is a good cartridge for any North American big game, and the 333 Jeffery has seen limited use by American hunters. It does well on moose or grizzly.', ''),

(499820, ' [QUOTE=masood357;337848]The 10mm Auto was introduced in 1983 ass the cartridge for the Bren Ten semi-auto pistol manufactured by the now-defunct Dornaus & Dixon Enterprises, Inc. of Huntington Beach, California. The ammunition is loaded by Norma and has a 200-grain full-jacketed bullet with a truncated cone shape, similar to some 9mm Luger and 45 ACP loads of some years back. According to data furnished by Norma, the ammunition is loaded to a mean working pressure of 37,000 psi with a maximum pressure of 44,000 psi plus or minus industry tolerance. This is getting up in the area of some rifle loads and makes this a pretty hot handgun cartridge. Muzzle velocity is listed as 1200 fps and energy at the muzzle as 635 fpe. This makes the cartridge more powerful than the 357 Magnum or the lead bullet police load of the 41 Magnum. The muzzle energy is about double that of the 45 ACP. The gun and cartridge are the brain children of Jeff Cooper and associates who are trying to develop the ideal combat weapon. Colt and several others now offer the 10mm chambering.  The Bren Ten semi-auto pistol is based on a modification of the much-praised Czech CZ-75 pistol design and has a 5-inch barrel, 11-shot magazine and weighs 39 ounces. It is a full-size combat-type pistol intended primarily for law enforcement/self-defense use. The 10mm cartridge should be an ideal combat round with good stopping power, particularly with an expanding-type bullet. It would also be a good field cartridge for small to medium game or larger animals in the hands of a good shot and skilled hunter. The ammunition is quite expensive, somewhat that would discourage the average person from doing much shooting. All in all, the Bren Ten pistol and cartridge is an excellent concept for a combat handgun, and it reflects the extensive background and experience of Jeff Cooper. In checking out Norma 10mm ammunition the bullet diameter is found .400-inch and the actual weight is 198.7-grains. The loaded cartridge weighs 288.4-grains, and the empty case with primer weighs 79.2-grains. The powder charge consist of 10.5 grains of a dark grey. very small, irregular length rod-type powder. Beside Norma, several other ammunition manufacturers are now offering 10mm auto ammo[/QUOTE]  very nice detail thanks bro.', ''),

(499822, ' 30 (7.63mm) Mauser\r\n\r\n    Developed by American gun designer Hugo Borchardt for the first successful commercial, automatic pistol. The Borchardt pistol was made by Ludwig Loewe & Co. (later DWM) of Berlin, Germany. Both pistol and cartridge were introduced in 1893. The Borchardt automatic pistol was later re-designed and emerged as the well-known Luger pistol. This cartridge was used by Paul Mauser for his Model 1896 pistol and than increased in power for his more rugged design. It has been used mainly in the Mauser military automatic pistol and various imitations or copies manufactured in Spain and China.\r\n\r\n    Until the 357 Magnum revolver cartridge came along, the 30 Mauser was the high-velocity champion of the pistol world. It has a flat trajectory that makes long-range hits possible, but lacks stopping power on man or heavy animals because of the light, full-jacketed bullet. However, it has been used successfully for hunting small to medium game and varmints at moderate pistol ranges. If hand-loaded with soft-point or hollow-point hunting bullets, its performance can be improved a good deal. It has never been a very popular cartridge in the U.S. due to the clumsy Mauser pistol and the high cost of ammunition. \r\n\r\nBullet = 86-grains. Powder = 5.2-grains. Muzzle Velocity = 1410. Muzzle Energy = 375\r\n\r\n7.62mm Russian Tokarev\r\n\r\nThe official Russian pistol cartridge adopted in 1930 for the Tokarev Model TT-30and modified Model TT-33 automatic pistols. The pistols are a basic Browning-type design similar to the Colt 45 auto pistols. However, they incorporate many original features to simplify manufacturing processes and must be considered an advance over the original Browning patent. These pistols are often a little rough or crude in finish, but are well made and of excellent design. They have a 4 1/2-inch barrel and a magazine capacity of eight rounds. Moderate quantities hae been sold as military surplus. Some were made in China and Hungary, as well as in Russia. The Hungarian-made Tokarev, in a modified form called Tokagypt, is chambered for the 9mm Parabellum cartridge. The Chinese began exporting both pistols and ammunition in 1987 at very reasonable prices. The cartridge is very similar to the 7.63mm Mauser and some brands of Mauser ammunition can be fired in the Tokarev pistol. Well initially, introduced as a combat handgun cartridge, however, the 7.62mm Russian is a fair feild cartridge for small game as it has good velocity and flat trajactory, but needs softpoint or hunting-type bullets for maximum effectiveness. Loading data for the 7.63mm Mauser can be used. The Speer 30-caliber plinker bullet of 100 grains makes a good hunting bullet, but because it is highly greater than standard weight, it must be loaded down a bit in velocity. \r\n\r\nBullet = 86-grains. Powder = 5.0-grains. Muzzle Velocity = 1390. Muzzle energy = 365.\r\n\r\nNow please if some expert explain how the 7.62x25mm is hotter than 7.63x25mm round, as I have always used 7.62x25mm rounds in my C96 and never faced any problem. Provided that I never dare to use local ammo through my Mauser C96 Broom-handle.\r\nRegards.', ''),

(499839, '33 Belted Rimless Nitro-Express (BSA) This cartridge is also known as the 330 BSA. It was introduced by Birmingham Small Arms about 1923 for their bolt-action sporting rifles based on the military Enfield. It was never very popular and was discontinued some years ago.\r\n\r\nLike the rimless 26 BSA, the 33 was an effort to furnish a high-velocity cartridge in a popular caliber. Neither effort was a commercial success. The 165-grain bullet starts out at 3000 fps, but at 100 yards is down to about 2650. The 330 BSA gave good killing power on light game, but failed to penetrate properly on the heavy varieties. For this reason it was not a good general-purpose caliber for African game. Why the manufacturer didn''t offer a choice of bullets with weights up to, say 250-grains is a mystery. Basically this is a good case design for modern rifles. The hand-loader could improve this one and put it in the same class as the 333 Jeffery. Although not satisfactory for African game, the 330 BSA would do well on North American big game with the possible exception of moose or grizzly bear. Loaded with proper bullets, it would do for anything. The wildcat 333 Express cartridge, which is the 30 Short Magnum necked-up, is very similar to the 330 BSA. Bullet diameter is .338-inch, the same as the Winchester 338 Magnum. When hand-loading this cartridge, remember the Enfield action will not stand the same high working pressures as the Mauser action.', ''),

(499868, '350 Rimless Magnum (Rigby) A proprietary cartridge introduced by John Rigby in 1908. It was designed for bolt-action magazine rifles and a similar rimmed version was made for use in single shot or double rifles. The flanged cartridge was called the 350 No. 2 Rigby, but it has been obsolete for a number of years.\r\n\r\nThe 350 Rigby Magnum was popular with some African and Asian hunters. In performance it is quite similar to the 35 Whelen. Many hunters like the 350 Rigby because it has less recoil than the 375 H&H Magnum. It would be a fine cartridge for any North American big game in open country, but not in close cover. By American standards it is not a terrifically powerful cartridge, but it apparently used a well-designed bullet.', ''),

So far, I have not carried gun on bike with me in the city, I have a fear that I might not get a chance to use it fairly and wisely when I am on bike so rather I just put a 500 or 1000 rupee note in my pocket and take my inferior cheap mobile phone with me while I am vulnerable (or on bike).

(499944, ' 22LR - Improve Your Ammunition\n \nWith 22LR ammo we have little choice but use what we have or go shopping for another type. There are many makes and types of 22LR ammo in the marketplace. If you were to take every make and type of ammunition available for testing, it would take a truckload of money and perhaps a ticket around the world to collect all of them and good part of your life to test them. Unlike center fire cartridge we can not select 22LR cartridge components - brass, primer, power and bullet to cook-up custom 22LR loads.\n \nPerhaps you already have some 22LR ammo. Perhaps you are going to buy some. Would you be interested in “improving” the ammo you have or the ammo you are going to buy? If this topic is of interest - read on.\n \nI have used a beam scale with a resolution of 0.1 grain (0.1 grain = 0.0064799 gram) and weighed and sorted thousands of 22LR cartridges to do an in-depth study on the amount variability of cartridge weight within each make and type of ammunition. See post #7 for details of this effort and post #233 on ideas for minimizing “flyer’ shots.\n \nYou may want to buy a small digital scale to sort your ammo by weight. Cost of such a scale bought online is about $10-15, a very good investment. Few of you can share the expense and get the benefit of knowing the ammo you will be using will be of consistent weight. After weighing you can batch the cartridges in increments of 0.1 grain like I did or select another measure to define your sorting criteria.', ''),

(499993, '41 Smith &amp; Wesson Magnum The Smith & Wesson Magnum revolver cartridge was introduced in June, 1964 along with the S&W Model 57 revolver. This is a heavy-frame gun, essentially the same as the 44 Magnum, but of smaller caliber. The 41 Magnum is very similar to an old, but little-known wildcat cartridge called the 400 Eimer. Bullet diameter of the 41 Magnum is a true .410-inch rather than the .386-.387-inch of the 41 Long Colt. Both a police load and a more powerful soft-point hunting round were introduced at the same time.\r\nLike most new cartridges, a number of individuals claim to have originated or influenced the design of the 41 Magnum. It might be well in passing to mention that the 400 Eimer appeared around 1924. Possibly a number of persons working over a period of time convinced Smith & Wesson that it would be a good idea to bring out such a round. Probably Elmer Keith deserves the major credit. This author is one of few on record as stating flatly he didn''t have anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nThere has been much argument as to the need for a police cartridge of greater stopping power than the 357 Magnum. Why a blunt 200-grain bullet for the 357 wouldn''t have serve this purpose. Also, a lighter 210-grain police load could have been worked up for the 44 Magnum. However, someone wanted a new cartridge and the 41 Magnum is the result.\r\nActually, the new round is more practical all-round hunting cartridge for the average individual than the 44 Magnum. The 357 is not entirely adequate for big game except in the hands of a good shot and experienced handgun hunter. The 44 Magnum is overpowered for anything but big game and most people don''t shoot very well with it. The 41 Magnum covers the small, medium game and varmint-through-deer class quite adequately. Its effectiveness on anything heavier than deer would depend on who was using it and under what conditions.\r\nRecoil and muzzle blast of the 41 Magnum are slightly less than the 44 Magnum, but still heavy. the average shooter will require about as much training and practice to master one as the other. The 210-grain lead police load with its 1150 fps is relatively pleasant to shoot and really quite adequate for small game or varmints at average handgun ranges. Factory-claimed velocities are for 8 3/8-inch barrel. Velocities developed from the 6-inch barrel is about 1000 fps for the police load and 1360 to 1400 fps for the soft-point hunting load. In summing up, the 41 Magnum is not quite as powerful as the 44 Magnum, but it is all the gun the average handgun hunter needs. A number of police departments have adopted the 41 Magnum but most have stayed with the 38 Special or 357 Magnum', ''),

(500004, '400/350 Nitro Express Introduced by John Rigby in November, 1899, this is the older 400 Nitro case necked-down to 350-caliber. Rigby provided single shot, double and bolt-action repeating rifles of this caliber. It was at one time the most popular and widely-used medium-bore cartridge for African hunting. It is currently semi-obsolete and rifles of this caliber are no longer made.\r\n\r\nThe 400/350 is a rimmed case that resembles the old 35 Winchester in general appearance. However, it has a longer case and uses heavier bullets. The popularity of the 400/350 wass due in a large part to the excellent bullet design, which gave uniform and dependable results on almost all big game. The wildcat 35 Whelen will drive a 35-caliber bullet of 300 grains at slightly higher velocity, and the much smaller 358 Winchester will about equal the 400/350 with a 300-grain bullet. The 400/350 would be a good cartridge for heavy North American big game. It was replaced largely by the more heavy 375 H&H Magnum.', ''),

(500008, '360 No. 5 Rook Obsolete black-powder cartridge originating between 1875 and 1880. It was not shown in post-war catalogs, but was loaded up until WWII. Although listed as a rifle cartridge, it was also used in handguns. The 1909 Charles Lancaster & Co. catalog illustrates it for their under-lever single shot rifle and the Webley New "Express" revolver. Many other arms chambered the 360 Rook.\r\n\r\nShot and blank cartridges were also furnished in this caliber. Although ammunition catalogs separate rifle and revolver loadings, in actual practice any version could be used in rifles or in late model revolvers. The 360 No. 5 cartridge is very similar to the 380 Long and 38 Long Colt. One owner of a 360 rifle claims the 38 Long Colt can be used satisfactorily in these firearms. There should be no danger if the Colt round chambers without forcing. Proved to be a small game load only.', ''),

(500106, ' 22LR - Importance of Distance to Target\n \nIn shooting 22LRs we are customarily faced with three key variables - rifle-ammunition performance, shooter&#8217;s competence and ranging to target.\n \nRifle-ammo performance can be tested by the engineering method - place firearm in a vice or a fixture and pull the trigger. The bullet will land at the target that is at a known distance. Sure, there may be (usually is) variability from cartridge to cartridge due to powder weight or bullet weight. This manufacturing problem can only be solved the ammunition manufacturers alone.\n \nPlacing the rifle in the vice or fixture removes variability related to the shooter&#8217;s credentials. If the shooter can consistently perform his task flawlessly, we can move on the next variable.\n \nIf shooting at a range, we know the distance to target or can find out by just asking someone. Our last variable still lacks answer. What about a situation in the field? At what distance will the rifle be zero-set? You can do an exceptional job of ranging if you can stretch a measuring tape between your shooting position and the targeted bird or animal. That bird or animal is not going just sit there and wait for you to do your thing. You can zero-set the rifle for distance you are likely to encounter the field target. Still, you have to judge if your &#8220;live&#8221; target is at distance for which you have &#8220;tuned&#8221; your rifle - your zero-set distance.\n \nYou somehow you have to determine or estimate the distance to target. Unless you can carry out this task, you will be unable to tell if you need to make any appropriate aiming adjustment\n \nRelated posts\n \n#47 22LR - Long Range Shooting\n#100 22LR - Shoot 150 Yards?\n#224 22LR - Hunting Challenge\n#235 22LR - Field Hunting - Why You Missed Target?\n#255 22LR - Wind & Bullet Drift\n#291 22LR - Importance of Ranging\n#363 22LR - Target Hit Either Too High or Too Low\n#439 22LR - Tangent Sight - CZ 452\n#440 22LR - Tangent Sight - CS 452 Metric/English Sighting Table\n#459 22LR - Do You Know Distance to Target?\n#468 22LR - Sight Rifle at What Distance?\n#475 22LR - Zero-set Your Rifle for Two Different Distance at Same Time\n#477 22LR - Scope & Windage Adjustment\n#483 22LR - Do You Plex?\n#485 22LR - How Many Clicks\n#497 22LR - Low or High Rifle Sight Mount?\n#498 22LR - Effective Range', ''),

Only u need to submit your CNIC copy a few of your pics with blue background and some advance to the dealer like may be some 10k, then u will get a call from HD person and he will escort you in the HD office, take your pics on computer linked camera, ask for the category of weapon you want on your license i.e. shotgun, pistol, revolver or rifle and the other related data which to be entered in the computer record.

(500132, '41 Action Express The 41 Action Express (41 AE) was designed by Evan Whildin, vice president of Action Arms, in 1986. The cartridge is unique among modern handgun cartridges in that it has a rebated rim of smaller diameter than the base, actually the same diameter as the 9mm Luger to produce a cartridge that will fit 9mm bolt faces and can be used in guns originally designed for the 9mm without the need for extensive changes. The 41 AE is chambered in the Action Arms AT-88, which is a beefed-up copy of the Czech CZ-75 auto pistol, and also the Uzi carbine and submachine gun. The cartridge was originally developed with a 170-grain JHP bullet at 1130 fps initial velocity. However, the first commercial ammunition, loaded by Samson in Israel and imported into the U.S., has a 200-grain flat-nose bullet with a muzzle velocity of 1000 fps. The original 170-grain load may be produced at a later date.\r\n\r\nThe 41 AE cannot be readily formed from any other brass case although it is possible to make cases from 41 Magnum brass by trimming to .866-inch and turning down the rim on a lathe. This is, in fact, how the first cartridges were made by Evan Whildin. According to Bob Olsen of Action Arms, the cross sectional area of the bullet is 33 percent greater than the 9mm, and the bullets are one-third heavier. He also says that the Samson brass cases have been strengthened so as to prevent any bulging in blow-back guns. Bullet diameter is the same as the 41 Magnum-.410-inch.\r\nThe 41 AE delivers practically the same ballistics as the 41 Magnum police load which should make it an effective police or self-defense cartridge. The AT-88 pistol is based on a well-proven design and should be accurate and pleasant to shoot. Recoil of the 41 AE is quite noticeably less than 45 ACP. If the 170-grain load is produced, it would be a good field load. However, one can hand-load cases with lighter jacketed or cast bullets.', ''),

Well if you already have a diana why thinking of buying new air rifles as it will fulfill all your needs if still you want to buy another gun go for hatsan. Recoil means the shock,force or vibration a gun produces when you fire it (Brother if im wrong do correct me).

The performance was remarkable after that. It was more accurate and had less recoil. However, it was more heavy after that.[/QUOTE]\n\nYeah i held one recently too. Its a awesome gun for .45ACP. Very well built and balanced. Should be more accurate then 1911s. I would''ve bought it if it fit my hands well. My thumb couldn''t reach the mag release button or the slide release button. But the night sights, chamber indicator are very good features. Only thing i didn''t like was the hard and long trigger pull of the DA, and the if the did decided to make it a double stacked then atleast they should have given more round capacity.

Black and smokeless powder ammunition is encountered. Both of the above revolvers been sold from time to time in surplus stores. \r\n\r\nThe 10.4 Italian cartridge is another one similar to the 44 S&W Russian. It would be an effective short-range self-defense or small game hunting number. Lyman cast bullet #421183 (225-grains) can be used for loading. Backed by 3 grains of Bullseye, it will deliver about 700 fps. These old guns are not intended for high pressure, so stick to moderate loads.', ''),

The Purdey is usually marked 400/360P or 400/360B. They are both the same power and neither satisfactory for general African use. The are in the same class as the old 35 Winchester, and like it, obsolete. They appeared about 1950.

(500321, '44 Smith &amp; Wesson American This is one of the earliest center-fire revolver cartridges. It was used in the Smith & Wesson single-action Model 3 revolver, Known more generally as the 44 S&W American model. It is known to have been in use late in 1870 and was probably introduced as early as 1869. The U.S. Army used the cartridge and revolver for a short time between 1871 and 1873. The Merwin Hulbert  Co. Army revolver also was made for this round. Commercial ammunition in black and smokeless type was manufactured until about 1940.\r\n\r\nThe 44 S&W American is another obsolete black-powder number that survived an amazing number of years. It used an outside-lubricated bullet of the same diameter as the 44 S&W Russian inside the case, but slightly larger diameter outside the case. Ammunition with both Boxer and Berdan-type primers was loaded. Re-loadable cases can probably be made by shortening and reforming 44 S&W Special brass. Revolvers for this cartridge are of the older black-powder type and loads should be kept mild. The 44 American could be used for hunting at short range, but there are better and more modern cartridges available. In power, it is comparable to the 41 Long Colt.', ''),

You might be interested that Robert Churchill, the gunmaker and promoter, advised storing the guns with the hammers cocked. He said that the difference between the cocked and uncocked pressure on the spring was insignificant. It&#8217;s under quite a bit of tension either way.

(500387, ' i found this on the net, don''t under stand it completely but i hope some one can explain it to me how to open the gun. i don''t see any place on the gun that gun can opened. i thought the gun comes in 1 piece. no ?\n\n[LEFT][COLOR=#303F50][FONT=Arial]I began calling the ISSC M22 my “lawsuit gun” after GLOCK filed suit against Austrian Sporting Arms, Inc. and ISSC Handels GmbH, in US District Court over supposed “trade dress infringement, trade dress dilution, and unfair competition”. At question, apparently, is the ability of the gun-buying public to tell the difference between the .22 caliber M22 and GLOCK’s world-renowned line of striker-fired polymer pistols. Reviews of the M22 run the gamut. Here are my impressions based on nine months of ownership.[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#303F50][FONT=Arial]ASA and ISSC clearly could have won the lawsuit, but decided it was cheaper to settle out of court in the late Summer of 2010 and agreed to redesign the M22 to incorporate new design features that would make the M22 more distinctive. At first glance, the M22 clearly resembles the GLOCK 19 with it’s blocky slide and angled grip. Closer inspection (and not much closer) reveals vast, glaring differences. Besides the obvious caliber difference, two things jump out at you from the back of the M22&#8242;s slide. The M22 is a hammer-fired, single-action-only pistol, not striker fired like the GLOCK. And it has an external, ambidextrous safety/decocker.[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#303F50][FONT=Arial]The rear sight is like the GLOCK outlined, squared U-shape, but it is adjustable for windage. The front post is not a dot, but a square. The slide serrations, vertical grooves at the back of the slide on the GLOCK, are a shallower, cross-hatched design on the M22, and are repeated at the front of the slide as well. The grip has finger grooves that make the gun feel very comfortable in your hand, but the front and back straps are smooth, unlike the GLOCK.[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#303F50][FONT=Arial]Looking at the trigger, the trigger guard on the M22 is rounded and smooth, unlike the GLOCK’s squared guard with it’s checkering on the front. The M22 has a bladed trigger safety is similar to the GLOCK, but there are two trigger safety mechanisms that are different. One is a key-lock located on the side of the trigger itself, which functions like the key locks provided with Bersa and Taurus pistols. The M22 comes with a small “key” with two prongs which can be inserted into this safety. Turn the key 45-degrees, and the trigger is locked. The other trigger safety is a magazine disconnect. If the magazine is out of the gun, the trigger will lock and the gun will not fire.[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#303F50][FONT=Arial]Disassembly is similar to most .22 pistols, with a touch of GLOCK thrown in. Like most .22 pistols, the slide is pulled back and then lifted at the rear, the slides forward and off the barrel which is fixed to the frame. To release the slide so that it can be lifted off the rails, a pair of GLOCK-style takedown levers must be depressed using your thumb and forefinger. The levers are actually easier to use than GLOCK’s levers, which I find difficult to grasp without sufficient fingernail length. The M22 levers protrude a bit farther, making them easier to get a hold of.[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#303F50][FONT=Arial]The barrel is not stainless, which is disappointing, and the recoil spring is coiled around it. Once the slide is off, you remove the spring, do your cleaning, replace the spring, then slip the barrel back into the opening in the end of the slide, pull the slide back, depress the takedown levers, and then press the slide back down onto the rails and slide it forward into battery.[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Helvetica][FONT=Arial, Arial Unicode MS, Helvetica, sans-serif][COLOR=#303f50]I found dozens of reviews saying they loved the gun and twice as many that said they hated it because it jammed all the time & .22LR cannot be used for self defence. Well the problem lies underneath, which is some company make way cheap ammo to save the cost it''s like using a 9mm cheap bullet from china. You will find them also unreliable. Now I barely use CCI bullets most of the time i just use ELEY Sport or Remington Yellow Jacket. CCI is very good but get too expensive specially when your buying in .22LR. The whole point of .22LR is to be cheap & effective. Coming to the second comments on the reviews about self defence. Working a Security officer I have been using using .22LR as a self defence weapon for over 20 years now. It had never let me down once. I go to shooting range twice a week & shoot at last 200 to 300 rounds not a single round got misfired. The secret is when ever i buy a .22LR pistol the first thing i do is take it out from the box, safety check first off course and disassemable it completely. Then i take a nice big silver baking cooking pan (which i have stolen from my wife) put the pistol in this case ISSC M22 in the pan and spray the whole thing with the  WD40 including the lower part which has grips on it. Now don''t be greedy and spray less, make sure the every part of the pistol is dripping wet. Leave all the part in the pan for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. Now don''t wipe or dry the pistol. Start assembling the pistol, once it is fully assembled take a clean piece of cotton cloth and just wipe the out side of the pistol. Once you done, you are now ready to fire any ammo in it. You can fire up to 500 rounds before you see any misfiring and that is only because of the chamber getting dirty. I use that method once a month specially when i''m firing more than 200 rounds.

He must have lost his wrestling match tonight, he''s gonna be real mad. Quick, hide!''""So, I opened the closet, but I figured that was probably the first place he would look, so I didn''t hide there.

I noticed the window was open, so I climbed out and was hanging there by my fingers, praying that the guy wouldn''t see me."The bartender says "Well I can see how you might be a bit frustrated at this point.""Well, yeah, but I hear the guy finally get the door open and he yells out, ''Who you been with now, you witch?'' The girl says, ''Nobody, honey, now calm down.''"Well, the guy starts tearing up the room. I hear him tear the door off the closet and throw it across the room. I''m thinking, ''Boy, I''m glad I didn''t hide in there.'' Then I hear him lift up the bed and throw it across the room. Good thing I didn''t hide under there either. Then I heard him say, ''What''s that over there by the window?'' I think, ''Oh God, I''m dead meat now.'' But, the blonde by now is trying real hard to distract him and convince him to stop looking. Well, I hear the guy go into the bathroom and I hear water running for a long time; I figure maybe he''s gonna take a bath or something, when all of a sudden, the jerk pours a pitcher of scalding hot water out of the window right on top of my head. I mean, look at this, I got second degree burns all over my scalp and shoulders!"The bartender says, "Oh man, that would have gotten me mad for sure." "No, that didn''t really bother me. Next, the guy starts slamming the window shut over and over on my hands. I mean, look at my fingers. They''re a bloody mess. I can hardly hold onto this glass."The bartender looks at the guy''s hands and says, "Yeah, buddy, I can understand why you are so upset.""No, that wasn''t what really got me so angry though."The bartender then asks in exasperation, "Well, then, what did finally make you anger?""Well, I was hanging on the window, and I turned around and looked down--I was only about six inches off the ground."', ''),

Instead of berating him, why don''t you give him some loving words, and welcome him home with a kiss? He then might change his ways." The wife thought that might be a good idea.

Excellent and useful input from all the members as well as details about the gun and the manufacturing company really helped deciding on the gun. So a BIG thank you to ALL. \r\n\r\nBought the gun last week and with the final paper work done with the licence am hoping to do some target shooting within the next few days. \r\nJust one question that i had, how important is it for you to be able to disassemble and reassemble (are these the right terms?) the gun. Because the dealer that i bought it from said that Chinese guns are not very freindly in this regard and one shouldn''t do it with them. If one doesn''t do it, then does this in any way affect the performance of the gun? \r\n\r\nThank you once again,\r\n\r\nregards,[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is out pleasure to help all new members.I was also new to Pakguns without a clue about handguns or legal aspects and all members helped me out and gave me excellent advice.', ''),

(500647, '375 Flanged Nitro Express (2 1/2&quot;) Introduced in 1899, this is a straight rimmed case, not to be confused with the 375 Flanged Magnum, which has a larger necked case. It was used in single shot and double rifles and BSA made a bolt-action Lee magazine rifle of this caliber. It is discontinued number that was never very popular anyway.\r\n\r\nThe straight 375 rimmed cartridge is not overly powerful for African use, but would be adequate for almost any North American big game, particularly for hunting in woods or brush. It lends itself to some improvement by hand-loading, which would be OK in a single shot or magazine rifle. However, the Lee action is not noted for great strength so one should stick to factory performance when using a rifle of this type. The cartridge look very much like the 405 Winchester, and one can make ammunition from 405 cases. Surplus British Lee-Enfield rifles could be re-barreled to handle the 375 straight rimmed case. However, they could also be altered to handle the 405 Winchester, a better cartridge and less trouble in long run. However, ammunition is no longer available for either.', ''),

It was designed for single shot and double rifles and has been very popular in Africa and India.\r\n\r\nLike its belted counterpart, the 375 rimmed is one of the finest all-round big game cartridge ever developed. It is loaded to slightly less velocity than the belted case, but not sufficiently so to make any real difference. One can use the same loading data as for the 375 belted magnum. However, where double rifles are concerned, you can''t change the ballistics without possibly making the barrels shoot to different points of impact. In that case you will have to regulate your load to the idiosyncrasies of the individual rifle by trial and error.

(500714, '44 Colt The 44 Colt is yet another black-powder cartridge of importance primarily because it was once used by the U.S. Army. It was introduced about 1871 and used by the Army from then until 1873. It was used in the metallic cartridge conversion of the Colt 1860cpercussion revolver, and could also be fired in the Remington Model 1875 44 Army revolver. Commercial ammunition was loaded in black and smokeless powder types up to about 1940.\n\nThe 44 Colt uses an outside-lubricated bullet and is similar to the 44 S&W American, but has a longer case of slightly larger diameter. Early ammunition used the inside Benet cup and Martin folded-type primers. Ammunition has become a collector''s item and revolvers for this cartridge are very seldom encountered. Ballistically it is about the same as the 44 S&W American.', ''),

American companies loaded the round up to about 1938-39. The 1933 Winchester catalog, lists it as for "Webley, British Bull Dog and H&R revolvers".\r\n\r\nThe Bull Dog-type pocket revolver was quite popular through the late 1800s. The 44 Bull Dog cartridge was much superior to some of the rimfire calibers of that period. It provided reasonably good short-range stopping power in a fairly compact gun. However, it is solely a short-range, self-defense round of little value for anything else. It is in the same class as the 41 Short Colt. The cartridge has been obsolete for a good many years.

The round was introduced about 1870 and is also known as the 11mm Austrian Gasser and 11.75x36mm Montenegrin. The revolver for the cartridge is a large, massive hinged-frame type weighing around 4 1/2 pounds. G. Roth manufactured ammunition (#287) and apparently so did a number of other companies including a few lots made by Winchester. Both the 11.75mm cartridge and revolver are now in the realm of the collector.\r\n\r\nThe 11.75mm is quite a large revolver cartridge, being longer and larger in diameter than the 44 Magnum. The 282- to 313-grain .455-inch bullet is also unusually heavy for a handgun cartridge. As a black-powder number , it should have knockdown and stopping power on a par with the 44 S&W Special or the 45 Colt, possibly better with the heavier bullet.

(500850, '476 Eley.  476 Eley Mk III British military cartridge used from late 1881 to mid-1891, when the 455 Webley Revolver cartridge, Mk I was introduced. Sometimes called the 455/476, this round has the same case and bullet dimension as the 455 Mk I except the latter is 0.5mm shorter in case length. Unlike the 476 MK II, the MK III has a clay plug in the hollow base. The charge was 18 grains of black-powder. Also known as the 476 Eley and 476 Revolver, the MK III can be used in any British service 455, but the bullet may be a bit large for use in 455 Colts or S&Ws of late manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe 476 has caused much confusion among collectors. Here are the facts, In November, 1868, the British army adopted the 450 Adams revolver cartridge. Generally unsatisfactory, nevertheless the 450 was used in WWI as a reserve weapon, a MK III 450 cartridge introduced at the same time. The 450 was officially replaced in 1880 by the 476 Enfield Mk I, shortly followed by the 476 Mk III as outlined above. In July, 1891, the 455 Mk I Webley appeared, a black-powder load soon followed by the 455 Mk I, Cordite round (6.5 grains) in Sept., 1894. At about the same time the .442 cartridge for the R.I.C. was adopted (June 4, 1892), made in only one mark as a service round; there was also, as there were with about all of these British handgun cartridges, blank cartridges in use. The 455 Mk II, Cordite, was adopted July, 1897, this being the first "short" case load, case length being reduced to 19mm from the original 22mm. A MK III round, approved Feb., 1898, and a Mk IV, approved May, 1912, both Cordite-loaded, were dropped because bullet form; both were considered of “dum-dum” or “explosive” quality. The last of the 455 ball cartridges was the Mk VI, adopted Sept. 1939, carrying a jacketed bullet and loaded with Cordite (5.5-7.5 grains) or nitrocellulose (5.5 grains), though a Mk V had briefly appeared, like the Mk IV but with antimony in the bullet.', ''),

(500918, '50 Remington (M71 Army) Introduced in its original version as the 50 Remington Pistol, Navy Model 1867. The cartridge listed here is the 1871 Army modification. Both were used in slightly different models of the Remington single shot rolling block pistol. The older Navy cartridge had a straight, tapered case, the Army-type a slight, but distinct bottle-neck. The Army cartridge also had a larger diameter rim that prevented it being fired in the Navy pistol. However, the Navy cartridge would chamber and fire OK in the Army pistol. Commercial ammunition of this caliber was available until about 1920, and used the Navy dimensions. Ammunition was loaded by both Remington and Winchester.\r\n\r\nThis is an obsolete black-powder cartridge of the early center fire-type originally with the inside primer. The old Remington rolling block pistols are much esteemed for conversion to modern cartridges and for target shooting. Standard load was 25 grains of FFg black-powder under 300 grain bullet. This large heavy bullet should have been a good man-stopper and would certainly be adequate for the usual run of small to medium game at short range. Ammunition for the Army-type pistol can be made from 50-70 brass.', ''),

(500927, ' 22LR - Pigeon in Sight\n \nYour rifle may be equipped with a plex-type scope (see post #483) that brackets 30-inch target at 100 yards with magnification set at 4-power. Your target may or may not be 30 inches in size or distance may not be 100 yards. Let us see how this type of scope can be used for ranging pigeons that are about 12 inches in length - from the beak to tip of tail. For discussion purposes we will assume that this is our “standard” pigeon.  Of course the pigeon you encounter may vary in size\n \nYou are in the field hunting. You come across a pigeon on a branch of a small tree. You quickly aim the rifle and rotate the scope’s magnification knob until you bracket it in the thin portion of the reticle at 4-power magnification. Can you quickly determine the distance to our “standard” size pigeon?\n \nSince our target pigeon is 12-inch in size and not 30 inches, the bracketed target distance will change accordingly. In this case you bracketed the pigeon at 4-power. What is the distance to target?  The pigeon in this case is at a distance of 40 yards (12/30*100=40) from you.\n \nBracketed target size will vary depending on the scope magnification. As the magnification increase, the bracketed target size will be smaller. If the magnification decreases, the bracketed target size will be larger. As we increase the distance, the bracketed target will be larger. As the distance decreases, a smaller target size will be bracketed. Let us look at the following table.\n \n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][B]3X[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]4X[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]5X[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]6X[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]7X[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]8X[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]9X[/B][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]100 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]40[/TD]\n[TD]30[/TD]\n[TD]24[/TD]\n[TD]20[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD]15[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]90 Yards[/B][/TD]\n[TD]36[/TD]\n[TD]27[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD]18[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][B]12[/B][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]80 Yards[/B][/TD]\n[TD]28[/TD]\n[TD]21[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD]16[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][B]12[/B][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]70 Yards[/B][/TD]\n[TD]28[/TD]\n[TD]21[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD]14[/TD]\n[TD] [B]12[/B][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]60 Yards[/B][/TD]\n[TD]24[/TD]\n[TD]18[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][B]12[/B][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]50 Yards[/B][/TD]\n[TD]20[/TD]\n[TD]15[/TD]\n[TD][B]12[/B][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]40 Yards[/B][/TD]\n[TD]16[/TD]\n[TD][B]12[/B][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]30 Yards[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]12[/B][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]20 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]8[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]10 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]4[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n \nYou may be able to make a quick observation from the above table.  Our bracketed 12-inch pigeon appears in each column.  In column headed “3X”, it appears as being 30 yards away, at 4X - 40 yards away, etc. If you simply add a zero to the magnification numbers from 3 to 9, you get the distance to target in yards! What could be simpler? Do you still need a laser rangefinder to hunt pigeons? If you have the money, why not go out and buy one. But, if laser rangefinder’s battery goes dead in the field, how will you judge distance to the pigeon that you are after? If you ever get in such a bind, you can use the method described above as your laser backup plan.\n \nNon-highlighted numbers under each magnification column indicate the target sizes in inches for the distances shown in the column on the left. \n\nRelated posts\n \n#179 22LR - From 20 Yards Zero-Set at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 Yards\n#456 22LR - Rifle Scopes\n#477 22LR - Scope Elevation & Windage Adjustment\n#483 22LR - Do You Plex?\n#485 22LR - How Many Clicks?\n#497 22LR - Low or High Rifle Sight Mount?', ''),

It could be a problem for you when checked by police or concerned authority, so better avoid such practice. Secondly when ever you sell your weapon you should sell it through a dealer who will mention the selling weapon on your license with his stamp, there is no need of any entry in DCO office after selling your weapon but after buying a new one you have to give your license in the DCO office for the entry.

(501021, ' Salam All,\nFrist congrats mirza125 and mubaidq brothers for the nice additions. The 911/909 has always tickled my fancy in the taurus line. It has the controls of 92, but the breach locking mechanism of a sig/glock. IMHO the only weak point in the 92 series design is locking lug arrangement, and the fact that it needs to be changed after a number of rounds have fired. I think this is the main advantage of the 911/909 series, and in theory should prove a more sturdy design. :)\n\n@mubaidq bro, the pic that u''ve uploaded is of the pt 911. Also, the pic has been taken from the net, its not u''re''s. \n\n@mirza125 and s.jawad brothers. First the capacity thing is not important. Mags can be modified either by including a plus 2 base pad or by changing the design of the follower in the mags(like the hi cap options from Mec-Gar). \n\nThe 909 and 911 are essentially the same pistols, the only difference being in the backstrap design. The 911 had a straight backstrap, like the vertec series from beretta and the 909 has the curved one.\n\n@mirza125 bro, can u please provide the source that u got the "8 shot" information from? because I couldn''t find anything online abt the early production line.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Also when you sell your weapon you have to buy a new one with in 3 months i guess or your license will be cancelled but not sure about this rule.[/QUOTE]\n\n+1, Agreed..........\n\nJust, wish to add, that in Punjab, by rule, selling or purchasing should be on the same date, if someone has sold the weapon and does not buy another one on the same day, one has to get permission from DCO for the extended period. Secondly, 3 months period is for the new license, one can get permission beyond this period as well. Issuing authority can give reasonable relaxations. \n\nSecondly, our dealers are Magicians, they can do any any thing and put anything into legal framework. But for personal satisfaction, one should always follow the legal pathway.\n\nWit due respect, I wish to add one more thing other than this topic which has been in my mind for months, several fellows say this is legal and that is illegal, I wish to ask one question, respectfully, What is actually legal to discuss? \nIn several discussion, fellows wrote, my license is coming through dealer, I did ''this'' through dealer, I did ''that'' through dealer. Dealers cannot do anything other than sale & purchase. Is it??\nWith due excuse, all stuff is principally ''illegal'' as one has to go through all the process from application to police verification by oneself, One has to produce/present weapon before DCO for its registration. I know the rules for the Punjab, Where only, Gazetted class 1 officers, Professional including Lawyers, Doctors, Businessman and Land Owners with the NTN can get the license with strict scrutiny. Fellows discuss, License can be made for 15k, 25k etc, HOW? Is this legal?\nLikewise, Fellows discuss, ammunition count has been increased for 1k, 2k etc. There is no legal fees to increase the ammo on the licence. Is this legal to discuss??\nOne can only purchase 500 cartridges max per year (to best of my knowledge), how people fire 1000s of rounds.\nI have many more examples. \nFellows can totally disagree with me but..............\n\nNote: I thought for several times before drafting this post but I could not control myself to do so.

It is also listed as the 9.5x56 or 9.5x56.7. There is very slight difference in loading between the two listings, but they are inter-changeable. The 9.5mm M-S is not carried in late European catalogs, and the British no longer load it. Apparently no European rifles are being chambered for it.\r\n\r\nThe cartridge was popular for a number of years with those who liked the light, handy sporting rifles. It did not have a good reputation in Africa for heavy or dangerous game, but was liked by many as a meat getter and performed well on thin-skinned, non-dangerous game with a muzzle velocity of 2150 fps with a 270-grain bullet. It has seen only limited use in the U.S. A good brush or woods cartridge for almost any North American big game, it is in the same class as the 358 Winchester, but has a heavier, larger diameter bullet.', ''),

It was chambered in Martini-action single shot rifles and various double rifles. It is obsolete and has not been used by British gun-makers for a good many years. The more modern smokeless loading was used by Purdey.\r\n\r\nAccording to a Purdey catalog of the 1920s, "The 400 is an excellent firearm for deer, wild boar, etc., and has gained great popularity for tiger shooting in India, having the advantage of being a really powerful firearm and no heavier than a heavy 12-bore gun. The bullet is lead with a nickle base, and at 100 yards has a striking energy of 1,443 foot pounds."

(501213, ' few reasons i''m asking my friend who is expert in guns way better than me asked him to type this on my behalf. \n1. my hand hurt like hell. \n2. since i don''t know that much about guns so he better off explaining things to you guys. \n\nThe Accident: Raheel shah loaded this issc m22 gun for the test fire. the mag was loaded 10 rounds with cci. since no one kept the count of the bullets. when the second last shot got fired the chamber of the pistol came back in the lock position (showing what most people know that meaning the mag is empty and pistol is in the slide lock mode). no one suspected that only fired 9 bullets instead of 10 that a bullet got stuck between the mag & chamber. he putted the pistol on the small tale that we had. on our way back when we all were about to leave, raheel got up and move towards the table to pick his pistol. what he did instead of picking up the pistol from the grip side, he picked up the pistol from the muzzle side the motion made the slide go forward and the firing pin hitting the last bullet stuck in the chamber. the bullet nearly passed his face by an inch or so and penetrated through his pam, mirror & in the wall. if he was just a inch forward that bullet would''ve hit left eye or brain. 1 inch back with the hand he would''ve shot his little brother. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18183[/ATTACH]\n\nMedical: The bullet damage his tissue, nerve damage with a broken bone with a deep wound. Requires 6 months or more best rest, therapy & treatment. the doctors say because it too early to say anything but if the nerve got damaged badly in that process then he won''t be able to use the fingers again. his whole family got scared with this incident. since he is only one in the family who support 7 members of the family. he says. he''s not going to use the gun again ever. \n\nFew Notes: " I WANTED TO BUY A GUN FOR MY & MY FAMILY SAFETY NOT TO PUT MY SELF NEITHER MY FAMILY OR MY FRIENDS IN ANY DANGER.

This gun is not easy to handle. A small error will throw u even out of target. \n\nIts very tight group even on 25 Mtrs. Forget the shot on 1 is an error. The rest r almost in a group. This group will b squeezed in next session. Remember bro, it''s 25 Mtrs where even it''s hard to keep Ur POA at one place on every shot. For me, this is the best shoot for the first time with TS. \n\nJust keep it up.', ''),

(501308, '450/400 BPE (2 3/8&quot;).  450/400 Nitro For BP (2 3/8&quot;) These two are just different loadings of the same cartridge-- a black-powder that originated about 1880. It is based on the older 450 bore necked-down to 40-caliber and loaded with 80 grains of black-powder and a 230- to 250-grain bullet. The Nitro version is made for use in black-powder rifles and develops very low pressure. The cartridge has been obsolete since about 1935.\r\n\r\nThe British worked up smokeless loadings for many of their old black-powder cartridges. For single shot rifles this was a great task. However, with a double rifle, the load had to be balanced to shoot to the same point of impact as the original black-powder load. Just working up the same velocity for the same bullet didn''t work. Various bullets and velocities had to be tried to arrive at the right combination. The 450/400 (2 3/8") cartridge was used almost entirely in single shot rifles. It is not a very powerful number, being in the same class as the 11mm Mauser and similar calibers. It would be a good short-range deer cartridge, but that is about all.', ''),

[COLOR=#444444][FONT=sans-serif][B]22 LR for Self-Defense?[/B]\n\n[B]More bad guys are stopped by .22 Long Rifle ammo every year than any other chambering, but is it a good choice for personal protection?[/B]\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#444444][FONT=Verdana]Why would anyone even consider the .22 LR for self-defense? Using the pipsqueak rounds when your life hangs in the balance may seem similar to the &#8220;Charge of the Light Brigade,&#8221; taking the approach that, &#8220;Theirs not to reason why. Theirs but to do and die.&#8221; That kind of thinking is unacceptable.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]The fact is, .22 LR is, will and has been used extensively for self-defense&#8212;probably more often than you think. Rifles and handguns chambered for the rimfire cartridge are affordable, compact and the most common of all firearms. They have been the gun behind the door in American households for more than a century. They&#8217;re easy to shoot, don&#8217;t make a lot of noise and don&#8217;t cost an arm and a leg to feed.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Why are they often used for self-defense? Well, why do you pick your nose with your finger? It&#8217;s convenient at the time.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]A .22 LR is the only gun some people own. That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the most appropriate. I&#8217;ve driven nails with a crescent wrench and smashed my finger, used a knife as a pry bar and cut myself and even tried to move snow with a dirt shovel and been down in the back for a week. We can all agree there&#8217;s almost always a better choice for self-defense. The question is: When, if ever, is the .22 LR a good choice and just how effective is it?\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]&#8220;Since the first rule of gunfighting is to have a gun, any gun is better than none at all. The little .22 LR may actually be better than some larger calibers, depending upon the ammunition selected. For example, I would think a high-velocity .22 cartridge like the Stinger might be a better choice than a .25 ACP loaded with FMJ rounds.&#8221;\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]A Practical Analysis of the Latest Handgun Ammunition, .22 LR Stinger ammunition was 58 percent more effective at producing one-shot stops than any of the FMJ .25 Auto loads.[/FONT][FONT=sans-serif] [/FONT][FONT=Verdana]When selecting a defensive handgun Head&#8217;s wife could carry in her pocket, he choose the little Smith & Wesson J-frame Model 317 in .22 LR. Several things convinced him it was the right choice. For one, similarly sized revolvers in .357 Mag. and even .38 Spl. can be uncomfortable to shoot. Second, Smith & Wesson&#8217;s eight-shot 317 only weighs 11 ounces. Finally, and most important, with the 317 his wife can consistently put all eight rounds into a target the size of an eye socket at 5 yards. Head asks, &#8220;What more do you need?&#8221;\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]&#8220;Nobody wants to get shot with any gun. It&#8217;s been my experience people just don&#8217;t stand there and let you shoot them. The most common stop is psychological. Most people stop fighting quickly after having been shot. Although we tend to worry endlessly about knockdown power and about what bullet and load is best, fact is, people just don&#8217;t like getting shot, and unless facing the rare superhuman, even a .22 can get the job done.&#8221;\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]&#8220;If you are going to use a .22, practice until you can reliably make central nervous system hits.&#8221; It&#8217;s hard to argue with the logic. After all, he does make his living training folks on how to use a firearm to stay alive at what might be the premier firearms fighting school in the world.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Lists of the effectiveness of six different .22 LR loads based on 4,483 actual street shootings. On average, the cartridge produced one-shot stops 31 percent of the time. Based on their sampling criteria, the .22 LR was found to be about half as effective as the .32 ACP. With data from 465 shootings, the second-best .22 LR load with 38 percent one-shot stops. With only 10 shootings, the original .22 LR HP load had the highest rating at 40 percent.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Statistics and predictions are interesting, but I like finding out for myself. While hunting, I&#8217;ve observed the effects of different .22 LR loads on a variety of animals. I&#8217;ve also seen a few humans who have been shot with a .22. Like almost every other cartridge, results varied. So I turned to ordnance gelatin. Using the Beretta Bobcat, a Smith & Wesson M&P15-22, Walther P22, ISSC M22 and a Kimber Crimson Carry with a .22 LR conversion kit, I tested Hollow-Point, but the ammo results came from Remington and my favorite .22 LR hunting load, the Eley Sport.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Remington ammo penetrated the deepest, but did not expand out of the Bobcat. Remington ammunition penetrated to a moderate depth and showed expansion regardless of barrel length. The real surprises were the two bullets Remington & Eley Sport are a very good results . Depending on the load, these bullets break into three pieces weighing between 10 and 14 grains each. Regardless of velocity, they always penetrated to almost 6 inches. About an inch or so into the gelatin, these bullets break apart, fan out and continue to drive on. They diverge from the centerline of the bullet&#8217;s path between 2 and 4 inches.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]One-shot terminal performance tests are interesting, but what if you shoot a bad guy multiple times? Based their findings on one shot, but I&#8217;m not sure one shot is the best way to evaluate the .22 LR cartridge for self-defense. Why? Because it&#8217;s so easy to shoot fast and accurately. With the help of some friends I tested this hypothesis using a SIG Sauer P229 in .40 S&W and with a SIG .22 LR conversion kit. We found we could get twice as many hits in the same amount of time with the .22 LR. There were also fewer misses with the rimfire.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Make what you will of this data. What cannot be ignored examined almost 4,500 instances where a .22 LR was used for self-defense. In the same study they tracked the effectiveness of 16 different .45 ACP loads for a total of only 1,728 shootings. Yes, the .45 ACP was more effective, but what&#8217;s astonishing was that they had twice the number of shootings to evaluate with the .22 LR. This should dispel any doubts the .22 LR is frequently used in an attempt to stop bad guys.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]So, what about stopping power? This term always comes up. For what it&#8217;s worth, consider that the first homicide I ever investigated, the perpetrator used a pellet rifle. Also, during my 13 years as a police officer, I pointed my handgun at a lot of bad guys doing a lot of bad things. In only two instances did it fail to make them stop. That&#8217;s potent stopping power, and the trigger was never pulled. I would add that none first asked me, &#8220;Hey, how big a gun you got?&#8221; Like Head said, nobody wants to get shot with anything. It&#8217;s a matter of perception and perception is important.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]The public&#8217;s opinions on the .22 LR for self-defense is also interesting. With the help of my friend. In four days he received 1,422 responses. It appears the average gun person is pretty sensible when it comes to personal protection. Most agreed a .22 LR was a better choice than a .25 ACP and that having a gun and being able to hit accurately and fast were primary considerations. A .22 LR handgun is about the easiest to get, carry and hit with. If it works!\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Anyone considering the .22 LR for protection must realize duds are a reality with rimfire ammunition, mainly with the cheap stuff. However, I once fired a brick of Remington during a prairie dog shoot without a single hiccup on ISSC M22. That said, CCI are not your typical .22 LR ammo; the case is longer and pressures are high. The same goes for the Stinger. In some guns, these just flat will not work.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Another fact is handguns are not the only solution to personal protection and bad guys are not the only thing we need protection from. My wife called to tell me my son had been chased into the house by a rabid fox. My mother-in-law was at home with the kids and they were all, according to my three-year old, &#8220;Freaked up!&#8221; I told them to call the State Police. A Trooper friend arrived and smacked the fox with a .45 ACP. It took two hollow points to stop the fox.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]In my closet you&#8217;ll now find a Walther P22 or ISSC M22 with a magazine full of Remington, with a weaponlight and a laser on the quad rail. My mother-in-law and my 10-year-old son can shoot the accurately and they know what to do if accosted by another rabid anything. If something goes bump in the night, it might be the gun I grab. It&#8217;s terrifying how swiftly and accurately I can shoot this carbine.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Twenty-two in the closet or not, I generally carry a .2LR Walther P22 or sometimes ISSC M22. In my office there&#8217;s a loaded, 16-inch-barreled lever gun chambered for the .327. A .22 LR is a key part of my self-defense. Lots of  people come up to me & tell me to use 9mm for self defence. I never use a caliber like 9mm for self defence. Now i''m not stating that 9mm is a bad caliber. There many other caliber out there which are better than 9mm. \n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]The .22 LR cartridge is truly a member of the Light Brigade when it comes to self-defense. It may be easy to shoot accurately and fast and it might be the cartridge most frequently used for that purpose. It may even work better than you think. For those who don&#8217;t have another choice, don&#8217;t have the money to procure another option or the physical ability to use anything else, the old cliché seems to fit. It&#8217;s better than nothing.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]If by intention or misfortune you end up relying on the .22 LR for protection, here are some good rules to follow: Use reliable ammo, shoot straight and don&#8217;t stop shooting until the threat no longer exists. That&#8217;s actually exceedingly good advice no matter what cartridge you choose. I personally choose ISSC M22 with Remington Yellow Jacket anytime anywhere.[/FONT]\n[/COLOR]', ''),

(501334, '450/400 Magnum Nitre Express (3 1/4&quot;) The 450/400 was originally a black-powder cartridge that dates back to 1880 or possibly earlier. It is listed in the 1884 Kynoch catalog as the 450 reduced to 400. It was used in falling-block single shots and various makes of double rifles. It evolved as a smokeless powder cartridge during the transition from black to smokeless during the 1890s. Jeffery designated a similar 3-inch smokeless round that is not inter-changeable with the original.\r\n\r\nIn physical appearance the 450/400 resembles some of the old necked 40-caliber Sharps. Winchester and Remington cartridges. In fact, 40-110 Winchester ammunition can be made from 450/400 3 1/4"-inch cases. In power it is practically identical to the shorter 3-inch version introduced by Jeffery and what have been said about one will apply equally to the other. It is in the 375 H&H Magnum class, although larger and more imposing looking. It is not a very practical round for North American use, but certainly has ample power for anything found there. Bullet diameter is .405-inch and some of the old obsolete 40-caliber rifle bullets can be sized to fit. Lyman #406150 (330 grains) is probable the best bet. Twenty-six grains of Du Pont (IMR) 4759 would give this bullet about 1400 to 1500 fps as a practical light load. Standard jacketed bullets of this diameter are not available in the U.S.', ''),

Center post designed bullets like Hydra-Shok have more predictable results and therefore offer some advantage as a projectile.[citation needed] In ballistic gelatin, the bullet typically displays very rapid expansion resulting in a larger but more shallow wound channel than would be typical from most other bullet configurations in the same caliber and of similar weight.\n\nthis needle is diffent with normal hp i think\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18194[/ATTACH]', ''),

Using the pipsqueak rounds when your life hangs in the balance may seem similar to the “Charge of the Light Brigade,” taking the approach that, “Theirs not to reason why. Theirs but to do and die.” That kind of thinking is unacceptable.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]The fact is, .22 LR is, will and has been used extensively for self-defense—probably more often than you think. Rifles and handguns chambered for the rimfire cartridge are affordable, compact and the most common of all firearms. They have been the gun behind the door in American households for more than a century. They’re easy to shoot, don’t make a lot of noise and don’t cost an arm and a leg to feed.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]Why are they often used for self-defense? Well, why do you pick your nose with your finger? It’s convenient at the time.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]A .22 LR is the only gun some people own. That doesn’t mean it’s the most appropriate. I’ve driven nails with a crescent wrench and smashed my finger, used a knife as a pry bar and cut myself and even tried to move snow with a dirt shovel and been down in the back for a week. We can all agree there’s almost always a better choice for self-defense. The question is: When, if ever, is the .22 LR a good choice and just how effective is it?\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]“Since the first rule of gunfighting is to have a gun, any gun is better than none at all. The little .22 LR may actually be better than some larger calibers, depending upon the ammunition selected. For example, I would think a high-velocity .22 cartridge like the Stinger might be a better choice than a .25 ACP loaded with FMJ rounds.”\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]A Practical Analysis of the Latest Handgun Ammunition, .22 LR Stinger ammunition was 58 percent more effective at producing one-shot stops than any of the FMJ .25 Auto loads.[/FONT][FONT=sans-serif] [/FONT][FONT=Verdana]When selecting a defensive handgun Head’s wife could carry in her pocket, he choose the little Smith & Wesson J-frame Model 317 in .22 LR. Several things convinced him it was the right choice. For one, similarly sized revolvers in .357 Mag. and even .38 Spl. can be uncomfortable to shoot. Second, Smith & Wesson’s eight-shot 317 only weighs 11 ounces. Finally, and most important, with the 317 his wife can consistently put all eight rounds into a target the size of an eye socket at 5 yards. Head asks, “What more do you need?”\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]“Nobody wants to get shot with any gun. It’s been my experience people just don’t stand there and let you shoot them. The most common stop is psychological. Most people stop fighting quickly after having been shot. Although we tend to worry endlessly about knockdown power and about what bullet and load is best, fact is, people just don’t like getting shot, and unless facing the rare superhuman, even a .22 can get the job done.”\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]“If you are going to use a .22, practice until you can reliably make central nervous system hits.” It’s hard to argue with the logic. After all, he does make his living training folks on how to use a firearm to stay alive at what might be the premier firearms fighting school in the world.[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]Lists of the effectiveness of six different .22 LR loads based on 4,483 actual street shootings. On average, the cartridge produced one-shot stops 31 percent of the time. Based on their sampling criteria, the .22 LR was found to be about half as effective as the .32 ACP. With data from 465 shootings, the second-best .22 LR load with 38 percent one-shot stops. With only 10 shootings, the original .22 LR HP load had the highest rating at 40 percent.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]Statistics and predictions are interesting, but I like finding out for myself. While hunting, I’ve observed the effects of different .22 LR loads on a variety of animals. I’ve also seen a few humans who have been shot with a .22. Like almost every other cartridge, results varied. So I turned to ordnance gelatin. Using the Beretta Bobcat, a Smith & Wesson M&P15-22, Walther P22, ISSC M22 and a Kimber Crimson Carry with a .22 LR conversion kit, I tested Hollow-Point, but the ammo results came from Remington and my favorite .22 LR hunting load, the Eley Sport.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]Remington ammo penetrated the deepest, but did not expand out of the Bobcat. Remington ammunition penetrated to a moderate depth and showed expansion regardless of barrel length. The real surprises were the two bullets Remington & Eley Sport are a very good results . Depending on the load, these bullets break into three pieces weighing between 10 and 14 grains each. Regardless of velocity, they always penetrated to almost 6 inches. About an inch or so into the gelatin, these bullets break apart, fan out and continue to drive on. They diverge from the centerline of the bullet’s path between 2 and 4 inches.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]One-shot terminal performance tests are interesting, but what if you shoot a bad guy multiple times? Based their findings on one shot, but I’m not sure one shot is the best way to evaluate the .22 LR cartridge for self-defense. Why? Because it’s so easy to shoot fast and accurately. With the help of some friends I tested this hypothesis using a SIG Sauer P229 in .40 S&W and with a SIG .22 LR conversion kit. We found we could get twice as many hits in the same amount of time with the .22 LR. There were also fewer misses with the rimfire.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]Make what you will of this data. What cannot be ignored examined almost 4,500 instances where a .22 LR was used for self-defense. In the same study they tracked the effectiveness of 16 different .45 ACP loads for a total of only 1,728 shootings. Yes, the .45 ACP was more effective, but what’s astonishing was that they had twice the number of shootings to evaluate with the .22 LR. This should dispel any doubts the .22 LR is frequently used in an attempt to stop bad guys.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]So, what about stopping power? This term always comes up. For what it’s worth, consider that the first homicide I ever investigated, the perpetrator used a pellet rifle. Also, during my 13 years as a police officer, I pointed my handgun at a lot of bad guys doing a lot of bad things. In only two instances did it fail to make them stop. That’s potent stopping power, and the trigger was never pulled. I would add that none first asked me, “Hey, how big a gun you got?” Like Head said, nobody wants to get shot with anything. It’s a matter of perception and perception is important.[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]The public’s opinions on the .22 LR for self-defense is also interesting. With the help of my friend. In four days he received 1,422 responses. It appears the average gun person is pretty sensible when it comes to personal protection. Most agreed a .22 LR was a better choice than a .25 ACP and that having a gun and being able to hit accurately and fast were primary considerations. A .22 LR handgun is about the easiest to get, carry and hit with. If it works!\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]Anyone considering the .22 LR for protection must realize duds are a reality with rimfire ammunition, mainly with the cheap stuff. However, I once fired a brick of Remington during a prairie dog shoot without a single hiccup on ISSC M22. That said, CCI are not your typical .22 LR ammo; the case is longer and pressures are high. The same goes for the Stinger. In some guns, these just flat will not work.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]Another fact is handguns are not the only solution to personal protection and bad guys are not the only thing we need protection from. My wife called to tell me my son had been chased into the house by a rabid fox. My mother-in-law was at home with the kids and they were all, according to my three-year old, “Freaked up!” I told them to call the State Police. A Trooper friend arrived and smacked the fox with a .45 ACP. It took two hollow points to stop the fox.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]In my closet you’ll now find a Walther P22 or ISSC M22 with a magazine full of Remington, with a weaponlight and a laser on the quad rail. My mother-in-law and my 10-year-old son can shoot the accurately and they know what to do if accosted by another rabid anything. If something goes bump in the night, it might be the gun I grab. It’s terrifying how swiftly and accurately I can shoot this carbine.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]Twenty-two in the closet or not, I generally carry a .2LR Walther P22 or sometimes ISSC M22. In my office there’s a loaded, 16-inch-barreled lever gun chambered for the .327. A .22 LR is a key part of my self-defense. Lots of  people come up to me & tell me to use 9mm for self defence. I never use a caliber like 9mm for self defence. Now i''m not stating that 9mm is a bad caliber. There many other caliber out there which are better than 9mm. \r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]The .22 LR cartridge is truly a member of the Light Brigade when it comes to self-defense. It may be easy to shoot accurately and fast and it might be the cartridge most frequently used for that purpose. It may even work better than you think. For those who don’t have another choice, don’t have the money to procure another option or the physical ability to use anything else, the old cliché seems to fit. It’s better than nothing.\r\n[/FONT]\r\n[FONT=Verdana]If by intention or misfortune you end up relying on the .22 LR for protection, here are some good rules to follow: Use reliable ammo, shoot straight and don’t stop shooting until the threat no longer exists. That’s actually exceedingly good advice no matter what cartridge you choose. I personally choose ISSC M22 with Remington Yellow Jacket anytime anywhere.[/FONT]\r\n[/COLOR][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nVery well explained brother.', ''),
(501360, ' 22LR - No More Sight Adjustment Left  - Rifle Still Shoots Too Low or Too High\n \nYour 22LR rifle has iron sights. You point of impact for the desired distance is perhaps too low or perhaps too high. To rectify, you remembered the rule in adjusting the rear sight - move the sight in the direction you want the bullet to go. If you want to bring the point of impact down, you lower the rear sight. Conversely, if you want to raise the point of impact, you raise the rear sight.\n \nYou have adjusted your rear sight to its maximum upper or lower limits. Still - rifle shoots either too high or too low. What can you do to solve this problem?\n \nLet us look at low-cost solutions. If the rifle shoots too low, there are possibly two solutions. If your rear sighs is step-ladder blade type, you may be able to get a machine shop to make another step ladder blade with higher steps. Replacement blade can made without much difficulty and minimal cost. Another way to solve the “shooting too low” problem is to see if you can “trim” the front sight. This would depend on the type/style of the front sight.\n \nFor the “shooting too high” situation, very likely there would be little metal remaining on the step-ladder blade if a lower notch was to be cut as the spring-blade that places tension on the ladder blade would likely be touching the barrel anyway. As for making adjustment on the front side, a machinist may be able to weld a bead on top of the existing bead.\n \nYou know the number of inches you want to raise or lower the point of impact on your target. Now the question - how much additional lowering or raising of the rear or front sight you need to bring everything in-line? The raising or lowering need not be carried out on the rear or front sight. It can be carried partially on the rear and partially on the front sight.\n \nHow much to raise or lower the front sight? This depends on three factors. First - the desired amount of raising or lowering the point of impact. Second - the sight radius. Sight radius is the distance between the rear and front sight. Third - the distance to target.\n \nSince I do not know any of the factors for your situation, I have computed and created the following table for solving problems involving sight radius of 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 inches and the distance to targets of 50, 75 and 100 yards. For the values given in the table, the point of impact will change by 8 inches for the indicated distances.  Say that you want to change the point of impact by 4 inches, just cut the values in the table by one-half.  If you want to change the point of impact by 16 inches, multiply the table values by two. You can use appropriate ratio for your situation.\n \n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]Sight Radius[/TD]\n[TD]  14”[/TD]\n[TD]   15”[/TD]\n[TD]  16”[/TD]\n[TD]  17”[/TD]\n[TD]  18”[/TD]\n[TD]   19”[/TD]\n[TD]  20”[/TD]\n[TD]  21”[/TD]\n[TD]  22”[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]50 Yards[/TD]\n[TD].0622[/TD]\n[TD].0667[/TD]\n[TD].0711[/TD]\n[TD].0756[/TD]\n[TD].0800[/TD]\n[TD].0844[/TD]\n[TD].0889[/TD]\n[TD].0933[/TD]\n[TD].0987[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]75 Yards[/TD]\n[TD].0415[/TD]\n[TD].0444[/TD]\n[TD].0474[/TD]\n[TD].0504[/TD]\n[TD].0563[/TD]\n[TD].0563[/TD]\n[TD].0593[/TD]\n[TD].0622[/TD]\n[TD].0652[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]100 Yards[/TD]\n[TD].0311[/TD]\n[TD].0333[/TD]\n[TD].0356[/TD]\n[TD].0378[/TD]\n[TD].0400[/TD]\n[TD].0422[/TD]\n[TD].0444[/TD]\n[TD].0467[/TD]\n[TD].0489[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n \nExample: Your 22LR rifles shoots too low at 75 yards by 5 inches. The distance between the front and read sight (sight radius) is 21 inches. How much sight adjustment is needed?\n \nTo compensate for 8 inches too low situation at 75 yards for sight radius of 21 inches the required sight adjustment needed is .0622 inch. In this example the point of impact drop is 5 inches instead of 8 inches in the above table. This can be solved very simply - 5/8 X .0622=. 0389 inch. The rear sight can be raised by .0389 inch, front sight lowered by like amount or rear sight partially raised and front sight partially lowered to accomplish the needed 5-inch point of impact adjustment.', ''),

According to John Taylor in his excellent book, African Rifles and cartridges, the short case was brought out because the longer black-powder number had a tendency to stick in the chamber after firing. The 450/400 Nitro-Express (3-inch) was designed for smokeless Cordite powder; it has never been  available with black. Prior to the 375 H&H Magnum, it was one of the more popular and effective all-round calibers used in Africa.\r\n\r\nIn terms of power, the 450/400 Jeffery is about on par with the 375 H&H Magnum, but is less versatile as to available guns and loads. John Taylor wrote that he considered this cartridge adequate for any African game under almost ant conditions, if used by an experienced hunter. As a professional hunter with many years experience, his opinion is something to consider. For North American Big game, this cartridge would be of rather limited use-fullness. However, it might be just the ticket for grizzly bear at close quarters. Bullets of proper diameter are not made by American manufacturers, but Lyman moulds for old 40-caliber black-powder rifles would probably work for cast bullets. Bullet #403171 (370 grains)for the 40-90 Sharps is about as close as one can get. The 450/400 Nitro express was used only in single shot and double rifles.', ''),

At a distance of 3 yards, draw and fire two rounds at center mass within 2 seconds, strong hand only, and repeat. Next, draw and fire two rounds center mass and one round to the head within 3 seconds, then repeat. \n\nMove back to 5 yards, draw and fire two rounds on two separate targets, aiming for center mass, each within 4 seconds. Retreat to 10 yards, and from a low-ready position, fire two rounds center mass within 4 seconds.

So, higher is the penetration (read over penetration) which causes less transfer of Kinetic Energy to the target.\n\n147 Grain Bullet. Heavier the bullet, lower is the velocity, thus lower is the Kinetic Energy. So, lower is the penetration which cause more transfer of Kinetic Energy to the target.\n\nTheoretically, 147 Grain Bullet is the best but it causes more recoil which means slow rate of follow up shot and less accuracy. Secondly, it cause more wear & Tear to barrel due to increased friction.\n\nThe solution: 124 Grain Bullet: It carry best of the two, Heavier Bullet but not so heavy and more velocity but not too much. So, it causes good penetration and good transfer of Kinetic Energy. It is the middle ground. It also offer control able level of recoil. Thus, no compromise on accuracy.\n\nNow question is FMJ or JHP? What JHP do is, it expands upon impact. Thus reduce chance of over penetration and increase transfer of Kinetic Energy.\n\nBut the issue with JHP is, it expand as soon as it come in contact with target. So, it has less penetration in hard surface.\n\nThe solution: Increase the propellant behind the bullet. Federal did this to their round (Not Only This, The Bullet itself is special also) and called it Hydra Shock. But, the ammo is too costly.\n\nPoor Man''s Solution: Load magazine with one JHP and on FMJ configuration.\n\nWhat is best: to me, 124 Grain WCC Nato FMJ. Why? It is bit hot round but increased propellant means no compromise on velocity and benefit of Heavy Bullet is also there. Yes! They may be bit over penetration but level of transferred Kinetic Energy will definitely be higher than normal 115 Grain Bullet.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(501393, '404 Rimless Nitro Express The 404 originated with Jaffery as a cartridge for bolt-action magazine rifles that would duolicate the ballistics of the popular 450/400. Approximate date of introduction was around 1910. Cogswell & Harrison, Jeffery and westley Richards made 404-caliber bolt-action rifles. This was also a popular caliber on the co ntinent, Where German- and Austrian-made rifles chambered it. In Germany, it is listed as the 10.75x73mm. It was understood that Norma loaded this cartridge especially for Cogswell & Harrison, at least for a time.\r\n\r\nThe 404 Jeffery is nothing more than a modernized version of the 450/400 and the two have identical ballistics. At one time, a high-velocity 300-grain load was available for the 404, but was discontinued. This load gave good results on thin-skinned game but proved rather unreliable on the heavier species. It was another case of expecting one bullet to do all things under any or all situations. With the standard 400-grain bullet, the 404 was a very popular general-purpose caliber in Africa and India. Properly used, it is adequate for any game found there. It is somewhat overpowered for North American game and lacks the flat trajectory and long-range potential necessary for much of U.S, hunting. However, it is another one that would make a bear gun round in heavy brush or timber. Bullet diameter is not standard In U.S. and one would have to find Eley-Kynoch or German made bullets. The only suitable cast bullet found is Lyman #419181 (285 grains) intended for the old 44 Evans. This, combined with 30 grains of 4198 would give approximately 1400 fps for a good light load.', ''),

It has a rebated rim of smaller diameter than the body of the case to fit the standard-diameter Mauser bolt face. It was used in bolt-action and double rifles.\r\n\r\nThe 425 was designed as a knockdown cartridge for use against dangerous game. With a 410-grain bullet leaving the muzzle at 2350 fps with 5010 fpe, it proved to be one of the best for that purpose and was very effective on elephant. Only one weight bullet was made, but it was available in solid, copper-capped and hollow-point-capped types. The solid was for maximum penetration, the copper-capped for limited expansion combined with good penetration. The hollow-point-capped was for quick expansion on thin-skinned game. The 425 has about the same power as the 458 Winchester Magnum and is over-powered for North American big game. It is largest of what the British call the large-medium bore class.', ''),

(501603, '500/450 Magnum Nitro Express (3 1/4&quot;) This is a rimmed necked case introduced by Holland & Holland because of the popularity of the straight 450 Nitro Express developed by Rigby. It is based on the obsolete black-powder 500/450 Magnum Express shell. It was used in single shot and double rifles and the smokeless version was introduced in the late 1890s.\r\n\r\nThe 500/450 differs little in performance from the straight 450, and it had a 480-grain bullet having the muzzle velocity of 2175 fps and muzzle energy at 5080 fpe. The British developed a variety of 45-caliber large bores, all of which churned up about 5000 fp of muzzle energy. They have about the same killing power and the choice becomes more or less a matter of which you prefer. All are very large, impressive cartridges, but the 458 Winchester Magnum, although smaller, is just as powerful. Many of the Weatherby Magnums also have more power and knockdown. The younger African guides have, in most instances, switched to the new American calibers because the rifles are cheaper than those made in England and the cartridges as much or more effective. The bullet used in British 45-caliber cartridges varies from .454- to .458-inch in diameter and there are plenty of jacketed or cast bullets available to fit almost any of them.', ''),

It was used in single shot and double rifles. The case is 3 1/4 inches long and it is quite impressive looking number, but dosen''t develop as mush energy as the 375 H&H Magnum. However it was considered adequate for any African big game. The smokeless version was called 500/450 Nitro for Black-powder, with a 365-grain bullet and 52 grains of Cordite powder.

Guns at hand were:\n\nMy Hatsan 125 sniper\nMajor Ali''s Diana P1000 \nMr. Moslim''s Diana 52\nNabeel Tirmizi''s Hatsan 125TH\n\nTarget was placed at [B]20 yards[/B]\n\nOut of these Nabeel was my friend, Maj Ali and I were acquainted long time back and Mr. Moslim was Nabeel''s uncle and Maj Ali''s friend. \n\nI went [B]especially to test the Hatsan 125TH[/B] (didn''t know the P1000 will also be there to pleasantly surprise me) and it behaved exactly how I expected, jumpy, jerky and difficult to shoot. It behaved quite violently and wasn''t easy to tame despite the fact I had been shooting the sniper version for some time now. The trigger to my surprise was very hard but I''m hoping it''ll smooth out and I intend to tune it later for a crisper break. Overall the 125TH would fetch a 6.5/10 rating from me, there''s a reason why the 125 sniper is tad bit expensive and today I knew why. Despite that, Maj Ali obtained the best results from it and got her to group at under 1inch with JSB exacts. With Gamo Pro magnums, frequent flyers would open up a reasonable sub 1 inch group to 1.5-2 inches.\n\nI had the extreme joy and pleasure to shoot the P1000 she''s such a great gun to shoot, that despite holding her for the 1st time EVER, I managed to obtain a 1/3 inch 5-shot group. Maj Ali was comfortably shooting 1/4 inch groups with it. A PCP is very very easy to operate, no recoil whatsoever, crisp and light trigger, relatively light weight and therefore it is such a joy to shoot them.\n\nMaj Ali shot my Hatsan 125 sniper and to my joy and his surprise he comfortably managed to achieve 1/3 inch groups with crosman premiers. It was his first time with the 125 sniper and he was reasonably impressed with how it shot, and said he''ll seriously consider this gun should he opt to add another gun in his inventory. \n\nSadly the JSB exacts did not group at all in my gun :( which is bad news as my JSBs are due to arrive by this weekend. So if the new arrivals don''t do well in my gun, they''ll sadly need to find another home :( (Maj Ali has already booked em if they don''t perform)', ''),

(501751, 'AMERICAN RIMFIRE CARTRIDGES  (Current and Obsolete) THE RIMFIRE differs from the centerfire in that the priming compound is contained in the rim and ignition is obtained by pinching or indenting the rim under the firing pin below. Rimfire cartridges are of considerable historical as well as practical interest. Although only one of a number of ignition systems leading to the modern centerfire, the principle was so good that many have survived to the present time. The common 22 rimfires had their origin with the Flobert BB Cap in 1845 which lead to the Smith & wesson -developed 22 Short of 1857. The idea of rimfire ignition probably goes back to Robert''s French patent 1831. This provided for the priming compound covering the entire head; leaving it out of the center would simply evolve into the rimfire. After the Smith & Wesson First Model revolver in 22 Short caliber was introduced in 1857, development of rimfire arms and cartridges was fairly rapid. The New Haven Arms Co. began manufacture of the 44 Henry cartridge in 1861, and the 56-56 Spencer round was made in quantity from about 1862, although the rifle design dates back to 1860. Both of these cartridges were used by northern armies in civil war. the first successful metallic-cartridge repeating arms were chambered for rimfire cartridges. By the end of the Civil War there were numerous different rimfire calibers available.\n There have been a great many rimfire cartridges developed for both rifles and handguns, not only in U.S. but also in England and Europe. By 1900 something like 75 different cartridges had been loaded by American companies, but only 42 were still around by the turn of the century. The initial decline in the number of rimfire cartridges was due in part to the fact that many of the early ones were of an experimental nature and so had a very short life. These are mostly of academic interest primarily to the more avid collectors. The criteria for inclusion here is that they were loaded by American companies and survived to the turn of the century. The more popular rimfires lasted well past the turn of the century and, off course, a few are in use at the present time. The 22 Short rimfire is , in fact, the oldest American cartridge, having survived from 1857 right up to today, and it will probably still be around as long as we are allowed to own and shoot firearms. At the present time all that is left in American ammunition catalogs is a variety of 22 rimfires. Some of the older rimfires are still loaded in Europe and from time to time one or two of these are imported into the U.S. Many of the cartridges listed here were actually available on an over-the-counter basis up through 1920s. One or two of the obsolete rimfires would probably be very useful to modern shooters, but it is unlikely that the ammunition manufacturers will revise any of them. \n Rimfire cartridges have certain advantages as well as defects when compared to the centerfire. In the smaller calibers the rimfire is cheaper to manufacture and within permissible pressures just as good as the centerfire. One of the most important disadvantages of the rimfire is that it isn''t practical to reload. This was a big consideration with buffalo hunters and pioneers of the Old West. It was also no small item among match shooters who developed top accuracy only by rolling their own. The rimfire will not stand up under the pressures required with modern high-velocity loads. Only the solid head centerfire cases has the necessary strength to fully develop the potential of the self-contained cartridge. Large caliber rimfire cartridges cost about as much as similar centerfire rounds, so there is a point beyond which the rimfire just isn''t worthwhile\n As late as 1959 Wincester introduced a new and hot little number 22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire. This cartridge develops a higher muzzle velocity from a 6 1/2" pitol barrel than any previous rimfire fired from a rifle! In fact, it beats out many of the older 22 centerfires. The 22 Long Rifle has became the most accurate and highly developed sporting cartridge in existence. Its popularity for match shooting and small game or varmint hunting is undiminished-- it''s increasing if anything. There are more makes, models and types of 22 rimfire arms currently manufactured than there are in any other caliber. New models appear in a steady and unending stream. What has happened is that certain of the rimfires have established a place so secure they will probably with us as long as guns are made. Those that died out just didn''t fill any particular need.\n Modern rimfire cartridges are intended for target, plinking or small game shooting. The 22 Long Rifle does very well out to 75 yards on rabbit-sized animals, even on coyote or fox with a well placed bullet. The 22 WMR will extend this range to a full 125 yards. The 22 Short is a good plinking round and in hollow-point, the high velocity version is as good as the 25 auto--if not better--for self-defense. The high-velocity Long Rifle is a more potent self-defense round than some of the older center-fires. It will penetrate better than the 32 Smith & Wesson when fired from a handgun. The 22 WMR develops handgun energies almost equal to the 38 Special. It would surprise many to know how many deer are killed each year by poachers using the 22 Long Rifle. However, it is not to be considered a deer cartridge. There is even a case of an elephant having been killed with the 22 Long Rifle, but that hardly qualifies it as an elphant cartridge, either. Within their capabilities and limitations, the modern rimfire cartridges are among the most useful we have. They will undoubtedly be around for long, long time.', ''),
(501752, '5mm Remington Rimfire Magnum The 5mm Remington Rimfire Magnum was announced during 1969, but was not actually introduced until 1970. Only the Remington bolt-action Model 591 clip-loading and Model 592 tubular-magazine repeating rifles were available for the round. It was not adopted by other manufacturers and is no longer loaded by Remington. For a time Thompson/Center furnished barrels for the Contender pistol in 5mm Remington. This is the only modern necked rimfire case; however, a number of the obsolete black-powder rimfires were necked so it is not an entirely new development. Bullet diameter of the 5mm si .2045-inch and with a weight of 38 grains gives a muzzle velocity of 2100 fps. This is the highest muzzle velocity of any rimfire now manufactured to date.\n\nThe 5mm Remington represented an interesting development that exceeds the performance of some of the early 22 center-fires. Its effective killing range on small varmint-type animals is probably some 25 yards greater than the 22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire. This is due to the better sectional density of the smaller diameter bullet combined with 100 fps higher initial velocity. Both are essentially small varmint cartridges, with the hollow-point-type bullet, for they ruin too much edible meat for small game shooting. However, the 22 WMR is available with a full-jacketed bullet, or one could switch to the inter-changeable 22 WRF for small game hunting. In summary, the 5mm Remington has the edge for varmint shooting, but 22 WMR is more versatile where small game is a consideration. On the other hand, the introduction of a good small game bullet for the 5mm Remington would have changed that analysis. They are both good rimfire cartridges and the choice would be a large matter of use and personal preference. Unfortunately, Remington has discontinued both the Model 591 and 592, and no rifles are currently made in 5mm RFM. Ammunition is no longer listed by Remington. The 5mm RFM is another good idea that didn''t catch on, although it had a lot to recommend it.', ''),

(501776, '.45 gap The .45 G.A.P. (often called the .45 "GAP") pistol cartridge was designed by Ernest Durham, an engineer with CCI/Speer, at the request of firearms manufacturer Glock to provide a cartridge that would equal the power of the .45 ACP but was shorter to fit in a more compact handgun, and with a stronger case head to reduce the possibility of case neck blowouts. G.A.P. is an acronym for "Glock Automatic Pistol", and the .45 G.A.P. is the first commercially introduced cartridge identified with Glock.\n\nThe .45 GAP has the same diameter as the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, but is slightly shorter, and uses a small-pistol primer instead of the large-pistol primer most commonly used in .45 ACP ammunition. Originally, the maximum bullet weight of the .45 GAP was 200 grains (13 g). In order to provide terminal ballistics on par with the standard 230-grain (15 g) .45 ACP loads, the .45 GAP was designed to operate at a higher standard pressure—roughly equivalent to the higher pressures found in .45 ACP "+P" rounds. Since the .45 GAP has a much smaller cartridge volume than the .45 ACP, the desired pressure and resulting velocity needed to be achieved through powder selection alone. Later development concluded that the .45 GAP could in fact fire 230-grain (15 g) ammunition just as the .45 ACP.', ''),

While it is based on a .40 S&W case necked down to accept 0.355-inch (9.0 mm) bullets, the .357 SIG brass is slightly longer (0.009-inch (0.23 mm) to 0.020-inch (0.51 mm). The cartridge is used by a number of law enforcement agencies and has a good reputation for both accuracy and stopping power.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]Developed in 1994, the new cartridge was named "357" to highlight its purpose: to duplicate the performance of 125-grain (8.1 g) .357 Magnum loads fired from 4-inch (100 mm) barreled revolvers, in a cartridge designed to be used in a semi-automatic pistol. Performance is similar to the 9x23mm Winchester.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The .357 SIG provided a self-defense cartridge close in performance to a 125 gr .357 Magnum, but from a semi-automatic pistol with greater ammunition capacity.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]Other than specialized competition cartridges like the 9x25mm Dillon (1988), necking a 10mm Auto case down to a 9mm bullet, the .357 SIG was the first modern bottleneck commercial handgun cartridge since the early 1960s, when Remington introduced the unsuccessful .22 Remington Jet (1961), which necked a .357 Magnum case down to a .22 caliber bullet, and the .221 Remington Fireball (1963). Soon after the .357 SIG, other bottleneck commercial handgun cartridges appeared: the .400 Corbon (1996), necking the .45 ACP down to .40 caliber; the .440 Corbon (1998), necking down the .50 AE to .44 caliber; the .32 NAA (2002), necking the .380 ACP down to .32 caliber; and the .25 NAA (2004), necking the .32 ACP down to .25 caliber.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]Several sources have published contradicting information regarding .357 SIG headspacing. This is due to originally designed as .357 (9.02mm)round but has been rapidly adapted to .355 (9mm) bullet. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente Pour L''Epreuve Des Armes A Feu Portatives) 2007 guidelines the .357 SIG headspaces on the shoulder (P2-H1). Some US sources concur this C.I.P. ruling. US reloading supplier Lyman once published the .357 SIG headspaces on the case mouth (H2).[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]According to the C.I.P. guidelines the .357 SIG case can handle up to 305 MPa (44,236 psi) piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every pistol cartridge combo has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The SAAMI pressure limit for the .357 SIG is set at 275.80 MPa (40,000 psi), piezo pressure.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]Most .40 S&W pistols can be converted to .357 SIG by replacing the barrel, but sometimes the recoil spring must be changed as well. Pistols with especially strong recoil springs can accept either cartridge with a barrel change. Magazines will freely interchange between the two cartridges in most pistols. .357 SIG barrel kits have allowed this cartridge to gain in popularity among handgun owners. However, the .357 SIG is loaded to higher pressures than the .40 S&W (the C.I.P. and the SAAMI pressure limits for .40 S&W are 225 MPa and 35,000 psi), and may not be suitable for use in all .40 S&W-chambered pistols due to the increase in bolt thrust.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]Because of its relatively high velocity[7] for a handgun round, the .357 SIG has an unusually flat trajectory, extending the effective range. However, it does not quite reach the performance of the .357 Magnum with bullets heavier than 125 grains (8.1 g). Offsetting this general slight disadvantage in performance is that semi-automatic pistols tend to carry considerably more ammunition than revolvers.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The Virginia State Police has reported that attacking dogs have been stopped dead in their tracks by a single shot, whereas the former 147 grain 9 mm duty rounds would require multiple shots to incapacitate the animals. Proponents of the hydrostatic shock theory contend that the energy available in the .357 SIG is sufficient for imparting hydrostatic shock with well-designed bullets. Users have commented, "We''re really impressed with the stopping power of the .357 SIG round."[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The bottleneck shape of the .357 SIG cartridge makes feeding problems almost non-existent. This is because the bullet is channeled through the larger chamber before being seated entirely as the slide goes into full battery. Flat point bullets are seldom used with other autoloader platforms because of feeding problems; however, such bullets are commonly seen in the .357 SIG chambering and are quite reliable, as are hollow-point bullets.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The "Accurate Powder" reloading manual claims that it is "without a doubt the most ballistically consistent handgun cartridge we have ever worked with".[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The goal of the .357 SIG project was to offer a level of performance equal to the highly effective 125 grains (8.1 g) .357 Magnum load.[13][14] The .357 SIG accomplishes this with a 125 grains (8.1 g) bullet at a muzzle velocity of 1,450 feet per second (440 m/s) out of a 4 in (102 mm) barrel, which is generally identical to the velocity achieved by standard factory 125 grains (8.1 g)r .357 Magnum loads out of a 4 in (102 mm) revolver barrel.[citation needed](A check of advertised ballistics both in articles from the late 1990s & current ballistics tables from ammunition manufacturers show commonly a nominal velocity of 1,350fps for the .357 SIG with a 125gr bullet in a 4" bbl.) The .357 SIG gains extra muzzle velocity when fired from a longer barrel, like an after-market drop-in 6 in (152 mm) barrel.(This might achieve a velocity of 1450fps.)[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]With a simplistic approach to physics, recoil being directly proportional to "muzzle velocity x bullet mass" (due to conservation of momentum), the recoil of the .357 SIG is equal to or slightly less than that of the .40 S&W, and less than that of the full-power 10 mm Auto loads or the original .357 Magnum, Handgun Recoil table as well as Federal and. This simple approach to recoil is only part of the story as it is not only the properties of the bullet that produce recoil, a more important effect is the rocket like blast of propellant gases coming out of the barrel, after the bullet leaves the muzzle, that plays a greater role in the felt recoil. A more accurate view on recoil is that it is proportional to the mass of all ejecta x velocity of ejecta. Even so, recoil calculated in this manner is only the starting point in a comparison with the .357 Magnum cartridge, since the latter is used in a revolver, in which all the recoil energy is due to the Bullet and propellant, while the .357 SIG cartridge is frequently used in a semi-automatic pistol of recoil operation, in which a significant portion of the recoil energy is diverted to cycle the action, effectively prolonging the recoil phase.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]In comparing the energy levels of premium self-defense ammunition the muzzle energy of 584 ft.lbs (792 J) of the 125 grains (8.1 g) 1,450 feet per second (440 m/s) .357 SIG load is higher than either the 475 ft·lbf (644 J) generated by a 155 grains (10.0 g) 1,175 feet per second (358 m/s) Speer GoldDot .40 S&W load or the 400 ft·lbf (540 J) generated by a 180 grains (12 g) 985 feet per second (300 m/s) Speer GoldDot .40 S&W load.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]Like the 10 mm Auto, the .357 SIG can be down-loaded to reduce recoil, to the point where recoil is similar to that of a 9x19mm Parabellum. However, since the .357 SIG uses bullets that are generally the same as those used in the 9 mm Para, downloading it to this point would defeat the purpose of having the SIG cartridge in the first place, as the .357 SIG casing was designed to handle up to 160gr. bullets whereas 9mm max out at ~140gr. and to download for recoil and ballistics to be identical to the less-powerful 9 mm cartridge would be a waste of time.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]Because the .357 SIG fires at relatively high pressures, muzzle flash and noise are significant with standard loads, even with longer barrels. Utilizing loads with specialized powders and experimenting with different bullet weights can reduce flash.[/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The Tennessee Highway Patrol currently issues the Glock 31 pistol chambered in .357 SIG. The Mississippi Highway Patrol issues a (Glock 31 Generation 4) with their logo engraved on the weapon. The Bedford Heights Police Department in Ohio currently issues the Glock 31/32/33. The Elloree Police Department in South Carolina Elloree Police also issues the Glock 31, .357 SIG and the Madison Police Department in Madison, WV issues the Glock 32 in .357 SIG. The Lexington Police Department in North Carolina issues the Sig P229 DAK in .357 Sig. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol issues the SIG Sauer P226 in .357 SIG. The Paramus Police Department in New Jersey also issues the SIG P226 in .357 SIG. The West Grove Borough Police Department, West Grove PA, also carry the SIG Sauer P226 in the .357 SIG caliber. Both the New Mexico State Police and the North Carolina State Highway Patrol use Smith & Wesson M&Ps chambered in .357 SIG. The Herculaneum (Missouri) Police Department uses the P226 and P229 in .357 SIG. The Orlando Police Department uses the SIG Sauer P226 in .357 SIG.[/FONT]', ''),

(501835, '22 BB Cap The rimfire 22 BB Cap, or bulleted breech cap, is one of the oldest successful, self-contained cartridges. It originated in 1845 for the Flobert indoor target rifle. These guns were also known as saloon (salon) or parlor rifles and were quite popular, through the turn of the century. A great many individuals and companies have made both rifles and pistols for the 22 BB Cap. This type of social, indoor shooting is still practiced in Europe, but has become virtually extinct in the U.S. American companies loaded the 22 BB Cap up to the WWII, but discontinued it after the war. The original cartridge had only a priming charge and a 22-caliber ball, but American ammunition contained a small charge of powder and a conical bullet in many makes. The original case was just a big tapered percussion cap without a well-defined rim. RWS (in Germany) is the only firm who loads the 22 BB Cap at the present time.\n\nMost authorities insist the 22 Bb Cap is completely worthless, but this author does not agree with such an attitude at all. Many rainy afternoons of target practice in the basement or garage created appreciation for this little pipsqueak. They are also very handy for a preliminary sighting-in of 22 rimfire rifles or pistols. Modern loads have sufficient power to kill rats, mice, sparrows or other pests out to 30-40 yards or so. At some close range, RWS BB Caps will penetrate up to an inch of soft pine or 1/4-inch of solid lead. They could seriously injure or even kill human being, so one should be careful with them. They are not toys. there is considerable variation in case length and dimensions between different makes. The CCI "Mini-Cap" loaded in 22 Short and Long Rifle cases more or less duplicates the performance of the older BB and CB cap for indoor target practice.', ''),

(501838, '450 No. 2 Express (3 1/2&quot;) This is actually a longer case than the 500/450 Magnum, but it uses the same bullet weigth at the same velocity. It was apparently introduced early in 1903 by Eley. It was designed for single shot and double rifles and is largely obsolete.\n\nThe only logical reason for designing a larger capacity case to deliver the identical ballistics of a smaller cartridge would be to reduce the breech pressure. It appears the British had some extraction difficulties during the transition from black to smokeless powder. At first, this was believed to be the result of the higher pressure developed by smokeless powder, but later they discovered most of the trouble could be eliminated by making the case heavier. The 450 No. 2 Nitro Express has been obsolete for a good many years, but plenty of rifles of this caliber are still around. It has about the same power as the 458 Winchester.', ''),

(501843, '22 CB Cap The 22 CB Cap, or "Conical Bullet Cap," is something of a cross between the 22 BB Cap and 22 Short. However, it has been manufactured in various sizes. In original form it was supposed to combine the 29-grain 22 Short bullet with the 22 BB Cap case and a light charge of black-powder. In actual manufacture, some CB Cap cases have a length about halfway between the BB Cap and Short. It is not a transitional design leading to the 22 Short, but rather a more powerful version of the BB Cap. Earliest catalog reference appears to be about 1888, although it probably originated prior to this. American companies loaded it up to 1942, but it has been discontinued since the end of WWII. German RWS caps appear to be the only brand presently available. \n\nThe 22 CB Cap managed to combine about all the disadvantages of the 22 BB Cap and Short into one generally useless cartridge. It was no more accurate than either of the two and made enough noise to nullify indoor virtues of the BB Cap. It also required almost as heavy a backstop as the Short and was just as dangerous indoors. In killing power it wasn''t enough better than the BB Cap to make any real difference, although it might provide an additional 10 or 15 yards effective range. In recognition of this, almost everyone in the business quit making it, and there are few laments from the shooting public. The original charge was 1 1/2 grains of black-powder, but after about 1920 smokeless powder was used almost exclusively. CCI in Lewiston, Idaho, currently loads the 29-grain CB Cap bullet in the 22 Short and Long Rifle case at velocities of 727 to 830 fps. Remington offers their CBee which is a low-velocity round based on the 22 Short and Long case with a 30-grain bullet at a muzzle velocity of 700 fps. Federal makes a 29-grain bullet in the Long case at 750 fps. These loads are intended for indoor target practice, gallery or pest shooting.', ''),

I am also glad that your experience was a HIT unfortunately our experience was nothing more than a MISS with two MP-155s. \r\n\r\nNow.... the important point to ponder over here is that would somebody invest in a product with a high probability of MISS?\r\n\r\nOn similar note.... would it be a wise decision to gamble with 54K rupees when there is a high probability of getting stuck with a MISS?\r\n\r\nBrother, I never said MP-155 is not a good idea. infact, I said "the idea is pretty sound" and I added that upgrades in MP-155 have the potential for success. its just that the manufacturing process has not matured enough to produce consistent quality for the time being.\r\n\r\nas far as comparing MP-155 with MP-153, well you can see the maturity in the manufacturing process of MP-153 by this very simple example that the other day brother Nabeel''s brand new MP-153 was successfully cycling light (24g skeet) loads without a hiccup. guess what? gas setting was not on light. on the contrary, the gas adjustment valve was fully tuned out to heavy load setting. you know what that means? it means that the gun''s system was efficient enough to even cycle light loads while being on heavy load setting. thats the beauty of MP-153. :)\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=fullmoon;339775]GREAT REVIEW 12 Gauge.\r\nWe also ended up exchanging our 2 mp155, one for a turkish escort and the other for Mp153.\r\nreally disappointed with the internals of the guns, after 2 boxes of shaheen super 4 and 1 box of elley in both guns,it seem that the gun was eating itself but still there were issues either with safety or with the extraction/cycling of cartridges,some times bolt got stuck in the middle of the action.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nalmost the same issues here buddy. infact, in one of our MP-155s. the bolt was stuck so bad that we had to remove the forend and yank the whole mechanism a couple of times to free everything up.\r\n\r\nthis weekend we are going to our range with another NIB MP-155 (third candidate). a distant friend of mine bought one a couple of weeks ago and is now pretty anxious to try it after reading this review. lets see, if this one is any different.

(501961, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;339963]Welcome to the forum. I hope you''ll enjoy your stay here. moving on, I have experienced two MP-155s to so far. both had similar problems. they were simply not giving us any love as they both refused to cycle anything.\n\nas you pointed out brother, we didn''t adjust gas setting on anyone of them as it is a common practice to leave the gas adjustment setting alone for a new gun and not temper with it till the time the gun is broken in.\n\nI am glad that your gun functioned flawlessly and you are happy with your purchase. I am also glad that your experience was a HIT unfortunately our experience was nothing more than a MISS with two MP-155s. \n\nNow.... the important point to ponder over here is that would somebody invest in a product with a high probability of MISS?\n\nOn similar note.... would it be a wise decision to gamble with 54K rupees when there is a high probability of getting stuck with a MISS?\n\nBrother, I never said MP-155 is not a good idea. infact, I said "the idea is pretty sound" and I added that upgrades in MP-155 have the potential for success. its just that the manufacturing process has not matured enough to produce consistent quality for the time being.\n\nas far as comparing MP-155 with MP-153, well you can see the maturity in the manufacturing process of MP-153 by this very simple example that the other day brother Nabeel''s brand new MP-153 was successfully cycling light (24g skeet) loads without a hiccup. guess what? gas setting was not on light. on the contrary, the gas adjustment valve was fully tuned out to heavy load setting. you know what that means? it means that the gun''s system was efficient enough to even cycle light loads while being on heavy load setting. thats the beauty of MP-153. :)\n\n\n\nalmost the same issues here buddy. infact, in one of our MP-155s. the bolt was stuck so bad that we had to remove the forend and yank the whole mechanism a couple of times to free everything up.\n\nthis weekend we are going to our range with another NIB MP-155 (third candidate). a distant friend of mine bought one a couple of weeks ago and is now pretty anxious to try it after reading this review. lets see, if this one is any different. I''ll make it a point to record a video this time. you know what they say: third time''s the charm. lols!\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nanybody remember russian airconditioners??????? similarly all other russian electronics and stuff???? one rule applied on all of them " chal gaya to khoob chale ga warna its u r luck" i d apply the same here', ''),

(501995, ' Doews anyone on Pakguns use this rimfire cartridge as it is my favourite.\n\nThe .17 HMR cartridge\n\nThe .17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire is the hottest cartridge innovation since the .22 WMR was introduced back in the 1950''s. It was developed as a joint project by Hornady, Marlin, and Ruger.\n.17 HMR\nIllustration courtesy of Hornady Mfg. Co.\n\nThe .17 HMR is based on the .22 Magnum case necked-down to accept .172" diameter bullets. New, sophisticated projectiles were designed specifically for the new cartridge, and enough Hodgdon''s Li''l Gun powder was used to give a 17 grain bullet a MV of 2550 fps and ME of 245 ft. lbs. in the Hornady factory load. Quality control was (and is) very tight; the goal is MOA (or better) accuracy from factory loaded .17 HMR ammunition. The result of all this is the highest velocity, flattest shooting, and most accurate rimfire small game and varmint cartridge ever produced.\n\nCCI, Remington, and Federal began providing .17 HMR ammunition, also loaded with 17 grain varmint bullets, and the sales of both rifles and ammunition took off. Winchester, PMC and other ammunition manufacturers followed suit, and the rest is history.\n\nThis cartridge is so useful and so impressive that comments like, "The best cartridge development in the last 50 years" and, "Makes .22 rimfires obsolete" were frequently heard from our shooters. One reviewer was wondering aloud if he could rebarrel his treasured Browning A-Bolt Medallion .22 LR rifle to .17 HMR.\n\nTo take best advantage of the long range potential of the .17 HMR cartridge, I zero a rifle to hit 1.5" high at 100 yards with the 17 Grain V-MAX bullet. This means the bullet hits dead on at 145 yards, and about 1.5" low at 165 yards, for a maximum point blank range (+/- 1.5") of 165 yards. At 200 yards you will need to hold 5.5" above the desired point of impact.', ''),

(502028, '22 Short The 22 Short is the oldest American, commercial, self-contained, metallic cartridge. It was introduced in 1857 for the Smith & Wesson First Model revolver and is still loaded and widely used all over the world. Although now popular as a short-range gallery or plinking round, the 22 Short was originally intended for serious self-defense. At one time it was also used for formal shooting and heavy target rifles were built specifically for it. Initial loading was a 29-grain bullet and 4 grains of fine black-powder. After 1887 it was available with semi-smokeless powder and within a short time, smokeless powder. Remington introduced non-corrosive (Klean-bore) priming for their rimfire line in 1927 and the first high-velocity type in 1930. Practically every company that makes firearms  turns out at least one model that will handle the 22 rimfire line. The 22 Short can be fired in any arm chambered for the Long Rifle, but all semi-auto weapons won''t handle all rimfires interchangeably. Since the end of WWII a number of small 22 Short pocket automatic pistols and revolvers have appeared on the market. Most are made in Europe.\n\nProbably more 22 Shorts have been manufactured and fired than any other single cartridge. In high-velocity the Short is quite adequate for very small game or bird hunting. However, killing power declines rapidly out at about 50 yards and only head/brain shots are dependable at or beyond this. Hunting use should be confined to animals of not over 1 or 2 pounds in weight. The 22 Short can be extremely dangerous because it looks small and relatively harmless. The high velocity fired from a rifle can penetrate up to 2 inches of soft pine and has an extreme range of almost 1 mile. Be careful! Make sure of your background and backstop before shooting any 22 rimfire. The hollow-point bullet weighs 27 grains and has about 25 fps higher velocity than the solid.', ''),

(502081, '22 Long The 22 Long is always referred to us a combination of the Long Rifle case and the Short bullet. This isn''t strictly true because the 22 Long happens to be some 16 or more years older than the Long Rifle. It is listed in 1871 Great Western Gun Works catalog as for the seven-shot Standard revolver. Within a few years it was also listed in Remington and Stevens catalogs as a rifle caliber. The 22 Long Rifle wasn''t on the market until 1887. The Long was originally a black-powder number loaded with a 29-grain bullet and 5 grains of powder. Smokeless powder was available for a time in both standard and high-velocity type, but at present only the high-velocity load is available.\n\nIn black-powder loading the 22 Long had a slightly higher velocity than the 22 Short or Long Rifle, but this was not true of the later smokeless loads. However, the high-velocity Long has a velocity between the Short and Long Rifle. The 22 Long is not as accurate as the Short or Long Rifle and has really outlived any useful purpose it might once had. The reason it hangs on is because a great many people still think it has a higher velocity and greater killing power than the Long Rifle, which is not true. Unfortunately, old ideas, true or not, are very difficult to change because most people  will not readily accept new concepts in opposition to what they already believe. In any event, the 22 Long is strictly a small game, short-range cartridge just a notch above the 22 Short.', ''),

(502112, '22 Long Rifle The best information available indicates the 22 Long Rifle was developed by the J. Stevens Arms & Tool Company in 1887 and that it was probably first available that year. It is the 22 Long case with a 5-grain black-powder charge and a 40-grain bullet instead of the original 29-grain. The Peters Cartridge Co. is supposed to have first manufactured it specially for Stevens. However, if this is true, why does the 1888 Stevens catalog refer to a UMC 22-caliber Long rimfire cartridge? This would be a gross ingratitude at best. This 1888 catalog lists their No. 1, 2, 9 and 10 model break-open rifles as available in the new caliber with special increased rifling twist. The New Model Pocket or Bicycle rifle also chambered it. The 1888 Marlin-Ballard catalog recommends the new 22 Long "Rifle" cartridge for their No. 3 Gallery rifle as being more accurate than the common 22 Long or Extra Long.\nAt one time the 22 Long Rifle was available in black, semi-smokeless and smokeless powder loads. Remington introduced the first high-velocity type in 1930. Both the 40-grain solid and 37-grain hollow-point bullets have been available for many years. The original cases were not crimped, a feature that did not appear until about 1900. Space would not permit a discussion of all the different loads and types of 22 Long Rifle cartridges or the multitude of rifles and handguns that have and do chamber it. Suffice to say, it is the most accurate and highly developed of any rimfire cartridge.\n\nThe 22 Long Rifle is not only the most popular match caliber in existence, but also one of the more widely used small game and varmint calibers. The high-velocity hollow-point is the best field load, and it''ll do a fairly good job on rabbit-sized animals out to 75 yards or so. Beyond that it is unreliable and can be a great wounder and crippler at any range if the bullet is poorly placed. Regardless, the Long Rifle is, unfortunately, a great favorite of many poachers for killing deer out of season with close-up head shots. The low report does not alarm or alert local game wardens. The solid high-velocity Long Rifle will, at close range, penetrate 6 inches plus of pine and has a maximum range of close to a mile. Maximum range is achieved at the relatively low angle of between 25-30 degrees, so one must be very careful. Humans shot with the 22 Long Rifle have tendency to show little distress, to survive without complications for several days, then die very suddenly. This is mentioned because altogether too many individuals are prone to regard the 22 rimfires as mere play-things, not powerful enough to be dangerous. Careless shooting with the 22 rimfire has probably closed more areas to hunting and caused more trouble than any other dozen calibers. Use your head and be careful! There is also a 22 Long Rifle shot cartridge loaded by most companies mostly loaded shot #9 pellets.', ''),

Cuz for a newbie its impossible to understand the quality of a second hand and being fooled by a local or a copy. I would suggest when you go to see a gun come back and search for 1st copy online and educate your self by comparing and reading articles on how to distinguish. Cuz after seeing a fist copy of taurus 909 i couldnt tell the difference n i was told some shops actually sell it as original. \n\nWATCH OUT. THINK OF IT THIS WAY..

(502134, 'First time buyer budget £2000 Hi,\n\nI am coming to Pakistan in April, and I wanted to buy a gun price range is £1500, - £2000 (British Pound Sterling) for home security, and also for carrying in the vehicle or on person while traveling withing Punjab. I live near Islamabad, I don''t have a Pakistani Passport but I have an Oversees Pakistani Identity Card, and of course I''ll also have my British Passport. I am looking to buy with a licence, so it should all come within £2000, and I will only buy from a registered arms dealer, and only authentic weapon.\n\nI am 29 years old, I''ve had pellet/gas guns in the UK, so I am familiar with the ethics of using a gun. \n\nAnother question I wanted to ask is, if I am unable to get a licence, and I get a gun without a licence, and the police catch me with it, what will the penalty be? and secondly, what if one shoots an intruder in-self defense and kills them and doesn''t have a licensed gun what is the penalty?\n\nIdeally I am looking to buy with a licence, but If I am unable to get one, I am still going to buy a gun, regardless because I am not going to compromise on security this time round.\n\n\nP.S, when I was in Pakistan in late 2009, I was driving and was hijacked by masked gunmen near my village in Gujjar Khan, the car was stolen and 20,000 rs, I didn''t have any protection, they got me out of the car, gave me 500rs and left me there and took the car. Anyway, we recovered the car and almost all of the money (the police are useless over there) we had to get extended relatives involved into this to get anywhere with this.

Later on when I got my family involved into this, they said it was a misunderstanding etc, etc and made excuses. It was only because a family friend who worked very high up in the police force helped that anything was recovered, two phone calls from him and suddenly they changed their whole attitude, and within 2 days they recovered everything. One of the police officer even asked me, the fee was a misunderstanding and returned my money of rs5,000 he said I don''t have to pay them anything. It turned, that the "fee" was just a subtle way of them saying give us some money before they will do anything.

(502156, ' 22LR - Specialty 22 Long Rifle Cartridges\n \nThe 22LR cartridges cater to a very diverse audience around the globe. We are familiar with the regular run-of-the-mill 22LR cartridges. These include subsonic, standard velocity, high velocity and hyper velocity ammunition. There are some 22LR cartridges that are kind of odd-balls. Let us look at a sampling.\n \n22LR Aguila 20-grain Super Colibri. This cartridge has no gunpowder. It propels the bullet with combustion of the primer alone. The cartridge is designed for handguns. Be warned that use of this cartridge in rifles could lead to a dangerous situation wherein the bullet may not exit the barrel when the trigger is pulled.\n \n22LR Aguila 60-grain SSS Sniper SubSonic. This cartridge has a lead, solid, round nose bullet. This cartridge has the heaviest-weight bullet in the 22LR arena. To stay within the cartridge overall-length, the manufacturer uses a shot length brass cartridge to accommodate the long 60-grain bullet. Barrel twist rate of 1:16 in 22LR rifles is not sufficient to stabilize this heavy bullet. For this reason keyhole results are often reported.  Muzzle velocity is 950 feet per second. Muzzle energy is 120 foot-pounds\n \n22LR Shotshell. These are shotgun-type 22LR cartridge that propel pellets. Useful range is about 10 yards. Use these in the field if you come across a snake where possibly you may miss the target with a regular 22LR cartridge. CCI (0039) and Winchester (X22LRS) use #12 pellets.\n \n22LR Tracer. The base of the bullet has some kind firework-type chemical that burns upon firing the cartridge. As the bullet travels, the bright glow in the rear of the bullet traces the flight path.', ''),

(502188, '22 Stinger, Viper, Spitfire, Yellow Jacket, Super-Max, Xpediter, Etc. The 22 Stinger was the first of a series of developments aimed at improving the performance of the time-tried 22 Long Rifle, Introduced by CCI the ("good ol'' boys"  in Lewiston, Idaho) early in 1977, the concept was an immediate success and was quickly copied by first Winchester with their Xpediter and later by Remington and their Yellow Jacket. The Etc. in the above title is intended to catch any others who jump on the band wagon. Basically, all of these cartridges are pretty much the same and are based (except for the Yellow Jacket) on lengthening the 22 Long Rifle case .1-inch, or thereabouts, reducing the weight of the hollow-point bullet from 36 to around 30-32 grains and loading this into a case full of slow burning powder. The result is a 30 percent increase velocity and 25 percent increase in energy compared to the standard 22 Long-Rifle hollow-point high-velocity loading. The overall cartridge length of these rounds is the same as the regular 22 Long Rifle and so are all other dimensions except the case length. As a group, they are referred to as hyper-velocity 22s.\n\nThe author has fired all of the increased velocity 22 Long Rifle cartridges, available at the time, in both rifles and handguns and at the same time compared the performance with the standard line of 22 rimfires as well as the 22 WMR. When fired into paraffin wax blocks and soap bars, the hollow-points all demonstrated superior expansion and energy transfer as compared to the regular high-velocity hollow-points.\nA number of malfunctions occurred when firing the increased velocity Long Rifles in auto pistols, and they proved not to be particularly well-suited to this type of handgun. However, they work fine in revolvers.\nField-testing did not demonstrate any great advantage of one over the other in shooting jack-rabbits nor any great superiority over the 22 WMR, or ever the standard Long-Rifle high-velocity hollow-point. The Stinger-class cartridges do inflict greater tissue damage than the 22 LRHP. However, dead is dead and you can''t accomplish anything beyond that.\nThe Stinger-class cartridges do provide increased velocity and energy for 22 rimfire rifles and handguns and probably extend the effective range on varmint or small game by a few yards. The Stinger-class cartridges cost about 60 percent to 65 percent more than the regular 22 Long Rifle HVHP. They certainly have a place in the 22 rimfire lineup, but their increased performance is most pronounced when they are fired from a rifle rather than a handgun.', ''),

No need to fill them with anything as the fired primer can easily withstand a couple more strikes before getting too deformed to offer any support to the firing pin.\r\n\r\nFor extended use or dry fire practice it is advised to use proper spring powered snap caps as it offers support to firing pin by pushing the pin back with the power of a spring that sits behind dummy primer.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(502461, '22 Extra Long Introduced  about 1880, it was used in Ballard, Remington, Stevens, Wesson and late (1916) versions of 1902 and 1904 Winchester Bolt-action rifles, and S&W revolvers. It was listed in ammunition catalogs as late as 1935, but has been obsolete since then. It used the same 40-grain outside-lubricated bullet as that later adopted to the 22 Long Rifle, but the case is longer and held 6 grains of black-powder. It was originally a little more powerful than the Long Rifle, but not noted for great accuracy. Smokeless powder loads had about the same velocity as the standard 22 Long Rifle.\n\nThe 22 Extra Long will not chamber in arms made for the Long Rifle, but since the only dimentional difference is one of case length, Long or Long Rifle can be fired in Extra Long chamber. In terms of killing power the Extra Long is in the same class as the standard velocity Long Rifle. At one time 22 Extra Long was advertised as a 200-yard target cartridge, but it certainly would not qualify for this by today''s standards. The length of the case and overall length of the loaded cartridge made the Extra Long un-suitaible to most repeating actions, and that is another reason it became obsolete.', ''),

(502515, ' 22LR - Kill-Zone & Point Blank Range Shooting\n \nWe all know that no rifle shoots in a straight line. All the same, we adjust our rifle sight or scope for a certain distance - the zero-set distance. The zero-set distance occurs at two points during the flight of a bullet - near zero-set and far zero-set.  In common every-day talk we are thinking of the second-zero-set distance. When we are in the field, we do not know at what distance our target may appear on the scene.\n \nSince we have no certainty that our target will magically appear at our zero-set distance, we start thinking of compromises. We say to ourselves, “I will be happy if my bullet lands within one inch (in this example - no higher or lower than one inch) of my second zero-set distance. At times, it is called the “kill zone”. What is that distance between my rifle and my target that the bullet will stay within that one-inch limit? This is referred to as “point-blank-range” shooting.\n \nPoint-blank-range depends on several factors. The main ones include bullet velocity, bullet weight, bullet coefficient (aerodynamic property of bullet expressed in a number and referred to as BC) and height of rifle sight or scope above the bore. Online ballistic calculators make it simple to enter the required data to arrive at the point-blank-range.   \n \nLet us do this exercise for a popular 22LR cartridge, the CCI 36-grain Mini-Mag (#0031) with muzzle velocity of 1,260 feet per second and BC of 0.090. The riflescope is 1.5 inches above the bore. We want to find the point-bank-ranges with upper/lower limits of +/- 0.25, +/- 0.5, +/- 1.0 and +/- 1.5 inches. Here is a table that gives us the essentials.\n \n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]Kill Zone …………….......[/TD]\n[TD]+/- 0.25”[/TD]\n[TD]  +/- 0.5”[/TD]\n[TD]  +/- 1.0”[/TD]\n[TD]  +/- 1.5”[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]1[SUP]st[/SUP] Zero-Set Distance[/TD]\n[TD]27 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]24 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]21 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]19 Yards[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]2[SUP]nd[/SUP] Zero-Set Distance[/TD]\n[TD]47.1 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]52.5 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]61 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]67.5 Yards[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Minimum Distance[/TD]\n[TD]22.9 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]18.2 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]12.3 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]8.2 Yards[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Maximum Distance[/TD]\n[TD]51.3 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]58.4 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]69.2 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]77.5 Yards[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Drop @ 75 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]1.68 Inches[/TD]\n[TD]1.44 Inches[/TD]\n[TD]0.96 Inch[/TD]\n[TD]0.54 Inch[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Drop @ 100 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]4.98 Inches[/TD]\n[TD]4.66 Inches[/TD]\n[TD]4.02 Inches[/TD]\n[TD]3.45 Inches[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n \nIn the ballistic calculator input data, I “manipulated” the second zero-set distance to attain the maximum point blank range. Notice that as the kill-zone is expanded, the first zero-set distance decreases and second zero-set distance increases.\n \nExample: You want the CCI 36-grain Mini-Mag (#0031) bullet to land no higher and no lower than 0.5 inch. What are the minimum and maximum distances for this goal? In this case you have a range of 18.2 to 58.4 yards. If you zero-set the rifle at a distance of 24 yards (1[SUP]st[/SUP] zero-set), the bullet will also cross the line of sight at 52.5 yards (2[SUP]nd[/SUP] zero-set). At a distance of 75 yards the bullet will drop 1.44 inches. At a distance of 100 yards the bullet will drop 4.66 inches.  \n \nRelated Posts\n \n#456 22LR - Rifle Scopes\n#483 22LR - Do You Plex?\n#485 22LR - How Many Clicks', ''),

(502627, '500/465 Nitro Express A rimmed, necked cartridge with a loading of 480-grain bullet at Muzzle Velocity of 2150 fps carrying the massive muzzle energy of 4930 fpe, introduced by Holland & Holland about 1907 to replace the 450 when that caliber was out-lawed by the British in India and Sudan. This was an act of military expediency to prevent rebel forces from obtaining ammunition or components that could be used in military-caliber guns. The 465 used in single shot and double rifles and was listed in Kynoch and H&H catalogs as late as 1963.\n\nThe 465-caliber is rated as a good all-round number for Africa, including heavy or dangerous game. In terms of paper ballistics, it is less powerful than the 458 Winchester Magnum. However, from a practical point of view, it is about the same. According to Tony Sanchez-Arino, a professional hunter with extensive experience in Africa, it is "one of the most used and prestigious big bores in Africa." Regardless of how, it is rated for African game, it is somewhat over-powered for North American big game. Rifles of this caliber have been exported to the U.S. Bullet diameter is another odd one not used there and this poses a problem in hand-loading. Only one one bullet weight was used, as mentioned earlier, but the 480-grain slugs were available in solid, soft-point and metal-covered split types.', ''),

(502635, '22 Wichester Rimfire (WRF) Introduced for the Winchester Model 1890 pump or slide-action rifle, the original loading has a flat-nosed bullet, but the Remington used a round-nosed type for a time and called it the 22 Remington Special. The two are identical and inter-change able. Bullet can be either a 45-grain solid or 40-grain hollow-point in standard or high velocity loading. This cartridge uses a flat base, inside-lubricated bullet rather than the "hell" type of outside-lubricated of the Short, Long or Long Rifle and Extra Long. The 22 WRF was chambered in various Remington, Stevens and Winchester single shot and repeating rifles and Colt revolvers. It is no longer loaded by the ammunition manufacturers, and no one makes rifles and handguns for it. However, in late 1986 Winchester made a special run of 22 WRF ammunition packaged in old-style boxes and in packets of five boxes at a price of $40. This must have been aimed more at collectors than shooters.\n\nThe 22 WRF was the first notable improvement in the killing power of the various 22 rimfires. It is not as accurate as the Long Rifle, but in actual field use this is of no consequence. Out to about 75 yards it will kill small animals more cleanly than the Long Rifle. Although there is little difference in bullet diameter between the WRF and the standard 22 rimfires, the WRF has a larger case diameter to accept the full diameter bullet. It is much too large to fit the standard 22 chamber. The 22 Short or Long Rifle fits the WRF chamber quite loosely and will not fire or extract in many guns.

Desi ammo is basically reloaded ammo and The powder used in desi is said to be more corrosive. my belief is that if you regularly clean your gun (esp after firing it) and the ammo is right size, it doesnt do much harm. besides, the russian baikal is well built and tough.

One in million, there is always on e bad apple.\nI lived in USA 41 years, and such incidence has had happened even with top notch weapons, cars, and medicine.  In USA, if this kind of incident taken place, then government ban the item and thoroughly investigate until cause is found. Government takes in account numbers of factors for such incident before it is concludes either to recall or remove the defect free of charge. One incident cannot prove that all the caracals are defected. \n	There were some cases with Mr. Beretta, AR 15, M 16, S&W in early days but later model s were improved.

In 2010, I bought an  electric Generator made in China that lasted only 6 months, in fact it began to having problem the first week of purchase.

(502866, ' my 2 cents, I have not gone back to Pakistan in 10 years! Be an atheist and recite soorah Fatiha and aital kursi, it won''t hurt you! I have seen the business end of a firearm in Pakistan (politely surrendered 162.5K and walked away unhurt with 212K still hidden, back in year 2000, also please understand that the bad guy is under a lot of stress at that point as well, and his level of training and expertise in his field matters as much if not more than yours), I have had my life threatened quite a few times and missed bomb blast in Bohri bazaar, Karachi by 15-20 minutes and my house got broken into in Canada, spent time in jail for assault once, when actually I was defending a loved one, all my firearms were confiscated till the court decided in my favour. I personally would not like to rely on another person to keep me safe! If you can procure a legal firearm, good, if not, relying on close family members is much better than people you don''t know. Also you got some time till April, take some self defence classes and learn some quick disarm and knock down techniques and PRACTICE them everyday till they are second nature, this will give you some confidence. Also one big thing that people miss out on, if a guy leaves you alone and takes money, valuables and your car, that''s all fine and dandy! I would not use lethal force unless I felt that I or a loved one was being threatened with injury or death. Watching movies and performing those stunts in real life are two different things. Also zero or little experience with a firearm that you are meaning to use for self defence is not recommended. Remember, you have to live with whatever you do, and whatever you do becomes you, it changes you for the good or worse, you kill someone over a few thousand pounds, would that be OK with you, think really hard about this. In stress situations a person generally does not rise to the occasion but falls down to the level of their training. I myself would choose to go somewhere else for a vacation.

(502728, 'JSB Pellets - All is well that ends well ;) Since the pellets arrived I had been itching to test them, in fact I fired approx -10 shots as soon as I got em at around 9 pm and was quite pleased with how the Jumbo Exacts shot. 1st thing in the morning I was out shooting at 40 yards with the JSB Exact Jumbo pellets and was very very pleased with how they performed. The jumbo Exact Heavies were weird to shoot 1st as against my expectation they were hitting well above the point of aim. Theoretically heavier pellets at same distance should shoot a little lower. So I decided to see how they do on paper. As I was shooting at about 30 degrees incline at 40 yards I thought that might have to do something with the heavier pellets hitting above.\n\nSo I took off and tried them on paper at [U]30 yards[/U] without altering zero of the scope. The  Exact Jumbo pellets were very satisfactory and consistent and I shot 3 groups, [B]group no 3[/B] being the best of em all.\n\nJSB Exact Jumbo Heavy pellets were a different story. 1st group was like a shot gun''s pattern, second was no different, and similar story followed with the 3rd and 4th group. And all the shots were hitting well above the point of aim. Then I suddenly realized that I''ve never shot such heavy pellets from this gun, and I read somewhere that spring guns behave weirdly if you suddenly jump from 1 pellet to another. So to get the gun accustomed with heavier pellet I shot about 20 random pellets here and there, and then made my final attempt at paper which turned out to be the [B]BEST[/B] group of the day :D I only took 6 shots as I was scared to spoil such a beautiful group :p \n\nPart of the elongated groups could be due to the sun factor which was right above the target and really made it difficult for me to look through the scope properly and get a clearer image. At 1 point due to the recoil a screw from the scope''s side wheel adjustment turret popped out after which it got very hazy. I thought I''ve screwed the scope :p but after I fixed that screw it worked fine. Bottom line, had a GREAT day with the gun and my left elbow hurts like HELL as I cocked this beast for at least 80-90 times :p', ''),

So I stopped hanging around with him, I can''t understand why they do things like this.\n\nAnyway, am sure you all know what happens there anyway. Now am not even in the mood to wanting to go Pakistan anymore. such a shame.', ''),

(502864, ' 22LR - Squeeze The Most Out of Your 22LR Rifle\n \nLike many others, no doubt you want to get the most out of your 22L R rifle. You may have followed a very old and wise advise - try as many different types of ammunition as you can put your hands on.\n \nIf you use a rifle with rear open iron sight, perhaps one aspect of how to get most out of your 22LR rifle may have escaped you. You may have a rifle that has a step-ladder type of rear sight. This type of rear sight is very crude. By this I mean that the step adjustments can not be carried out in small increments to precisely move your point of aim on the target. One step up or down may either get your impact point too-high or too-low.\n \nThere is a cure for this malady - a micrometer-type of peep sight. Most peep sights afford your adjustment level of ¼ inch at 100 yards. Beside this benefit, you enjoy another aspect of this very old media. With the regular open rear sight you have to line-up the rear sight with the front sight and both of them with the target. A rifle equipped with a peep sight only requires lining up the front sight on the target - easy target capture.\n \nIf your rifle has grooved receiver for mounting a scope, you can use the dovetail for mounting a peep sight. At my end, Williams and Lyman are well known peep sight brands. There are also other brands of peep sights on the market.\n \nIf you are looking for a way to tweak your 22LR rifle, consider installing a peep sight.', ''),

(502939, '22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR) The 22 Magnum Rimfire was introduced in 1959 by Winchester, but they didn''t market a gun to shoot it until well into the following year. However, Ruger and Smith & Wesson advertised revolvers for the new round before the end of 1959 and savage chambered their Model 24, a 22-410 over/ under combination gun for the Magnum Rimfire shortly thereafter. The discontinued slide-action Winchester Model 61 was the first rifle of their manufacture available for the new round. At present there is a large variety of repeating rifles, pistols and revolvers of American and European manufacture available in 22 Magnum Rimfire caliber. \n\nThe 22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire is essentially an elongated and more powerful version of the older 22 WRF. Case dimensions are the same except for length, and the WRF can be fired in any gun chambered for the Magnum Rimfire. It is not safe practice to re-chamber older guns for the new round. With a 40-grain thin-jacketed, hollow-point bullet at 2000 fps, this is the most potent rimfire cartridge currently available. It is more powerful than the 22 Winchester center-fire, forerunner of the 22 Hornet. Its ballistics in a 6-inch to 8-inch pistol barrel exceed any other rimfire fired from a rifle. It is very effective 125-yard varmint or small game cartridge, although overly destructive of animals intended for the pot.', ''),

(502976, ' [LEFT][h=2]AIRGUN, CALIBER and PELLET SELECTION[/h][/LEFT]\n[CENTER]by Tom Holzel[/CENTER]\n[LEFT]Airguns are mechanical devices that turn the stored potential energy of a coiled spring or compressed gas into kinetic (moving) energy, and transmit it to a projectile. However, the kinetic energy (or "power"'') of a gun is not measured directly. Rather it is the energy imparted to the projectile (a pellet) that is measured. This pellet energy is the product of "velocity" and "weight" (actually "mass"), both of which are measured separately.\n[B]TARGET AIRGUNS:[/B]\nPrecision airguns that are used exclusively for target shooting (such as the Beeman/FWB 602 air rifle or Beeman/FWB P30 air pistol) require only enough energy (3 to 5 ft. lbs) to speed a .177 caliber pellet through 10 meters of air. The speed component can be low, but the accuracy of a pellet must be exceedingly high, on the order of 0.04 center-to-center (c-t-c).\n\nWith target airguns, repeatability of the power plant is a major aspect of high-quality. So are such accuracy related aspects of precision shooting as the character of bigger let-off (and its repeatability), adjustability of trigger pull and let-off and the adjustable fit of the airgun to the hand and body.\n\nThe ergonomics of reloading the airgun is also important to target shooters. This function should be as smooth and unstressful as possible to keep concentration at a world-class level. Pellet insertion should be easy.\n\nCO2 and pre-charged airguns eliminate one physically distracting aspect of target shooting - recocking---and contribute thereby to a smoother shooting process.\n[B]HUNTING AIR RIFLES:[/B]\nIn addition to reasonable accuracy, (two inches at 50 yards) hunting or field air rifles must transfer three to five times as much energy to the pellet as target airguns. The energy of a hunting rifle pellet should be at least as high at the target distance (pest birds, for example), as target airguns are at the muzzle (4 ft. lbs.).\n\n[B]PELLET CALIBER & WEIGHT:[/B]\n\n[B]A. Caliber.[/B]\nBy far the largest number of airguns are sold in .177 caliber, and this is the pellet size of choice for nearly all target shooting, plinking and some small pest hunting. .177 caliber offers the highest velocity for a given amount of airgun energy, and results in the flattest trajectory. However, the speed of sound--1080 fps at sea level at 32 F sets a practical upper limit on the energy with which a pellet can be propelled. Breaking the sound barrier results in a loud crack-just like a firearm and generally sends the pellet tumbling wildly.\n\nIt would take 16.8 ft. lbs. to propel Beeman''s Laser pellets to 1080 fps. and 21 ft lbs. for Beeman/H&N Match pellets in .177 caliber.\n\n.20 caliber (5mm) is a perfect example of obtaining large ballistic gains in performance with small, optimal changes compared to .177 caliber. The 5mm trajectory remains nearly as flat, but its heavier weight lets it carry about 40% more energy for the same velocity. This is the best general purpose caliber. The\n\n.22 caliber has a large gain in pellet weight and size and is only usable in the highest-powered hunting rifles. The range of the .22 caliber is less than the .20 caliber, and the downrange energy less than the larger .25 caliber pellet. .22 might be the choice if you owned a single hunting rifle.\n\n. 25 caliber is unbeatable in carrying the most knock-down force to the target because of its maximal pellet weight and resulting incredible shock value. It is the perfect round for the tough tree squirrel and the right caliber in high powered air rifles for any of the larger furbearers such as woodchucks, opossum and even raccoon.\n\n[B]B. Pellet Type.[/B]\nThe single most important factor in choosing a pellet is to obtain one that is accurate in your airgun! Only personal experimentation will let you discover the most effective pellet for your airgun/target combination Each airgun varies slightly in the way it handles different pellet types. Since the accuracy of pellets themselves will vary slightly from batch to batch, it is wiser to buy a years supply of pellets at one time than to buy in smaller quantities.\n\nUsing the same propellant, a light pellet will accelerate rapidly and leave the gun barrel at high speed. It''s time in the barrel is the shortest, thus reducing the effects of an unsteady hold. The light pellet''s time-to-target is also shortest so gravity can pull on it for only a split second. An accurate, very flat trajectory is the result.\n\nYet in some high-powered rifles, light pellets are ejected so rapidly they do not dwell long enough to get the full energy transfer of the decompressing charge of air. While the same rifle can propel an 8.6 grain .20 Laser pellet to 850 fps and a 14.2 grain Kodiak pellet to 700 fps, these figures show the Laser only acquired 14 ft. labs. of energy while the Kodiak obtained 15.5 ft. labs.\n\nThe speed of a heavier pellet is lower in the same airgun versus a lighter pellet. And, because of its slower speed, a heavy pellet takes a longer time to get to the target; this gives gravity a longer time to pull it down.\n\nNote that the drop of any pellet has nothing to do with its mass or weight--all pellets are pulled down by gravity at the same rate. The only thing that counts is how much time gravity has to do the pulling. It is only because heavy pellets take longer to get to the target that their trajectory is more bowed. A light-weight pellet traveling as slowly as a heavy weight would have an equally bowed trajectory\n[B]AIR RESISTANCE:[/B]\nOnce clear of the barrel, another ''energy thesis'' begins its work: air resistance. Air resistance increases with the cube of a pellet''s speed: double the speed, and air resistance increases eight times! This means fast pellets lose energy more rapidly than slower pellets. Energy equals mass times velocity squared. Since the energy imparted to a pellet is about the same and a pellet doesn''t lose mass, it can only make up for the different weight by changing velocity.\n\nIn fact fast, light pellets lose energy so rapidly that after 35 yards or so they can be traveling slower than heavy pellets. This is inconsequential in 10 meter target shooting, but it becomes a major disadvantage in hunting and field use.\n[B]WHAT PELLET SHOULD I USE?[/B]\nFlat-nosed woodcutters punch perfect holes in paper targets to aid in scoring and are required in competition. The slight effects of higher air resistance on accuracy due to the flat head are unmeasurable at 10-meter range, but do become noticeable at 35 meters and beyond.\n\nMedium weight round nose pellets like Ram Jet offer the best of weight and flat trajectory for medium-powered hunting rifles (12 to 15 ft lbs.). The closer you can normally get to your prey, the heavier the pellet you should use because heavy pellets (e.g., Kodiak. Crow Magnum, Silver Arrow) will penetrate much deeper and be less susceptible to wind deflection.\n\nWith the most powerful air rifles (R1/R1 Laser, RX-1, Kodiak. Crow Magnum III) consider only heavyweight pellets.\n\nThe Crow Magnum hollow head pellet is in a class by itself-it really expands! This is an ideal pellet for .177 and .20 hunting of all game because of the terrific shock imparted as the pellet doubles in size as it enters the target. Say good-bye to small caliber "over penetration." In .22 and especially .25 caliber, the Crow Magnum pellet is absolutely deadly with larger game--rabbits, woodchuck, etc. at ranges out to 60 yards with the most powerful air rifles.\n[B]ACCURACY:[/B]\nAssuming an airgun always exerts the same force on a pellet, the accuracy of a pellet''s path--it''s trajectory--is effected by three major (and some minor) factors:\n\n1) CROWN: During its rush up the barrel, a pellet is constrained from going anywhere but straight forward. At the instant the pellet leaves the barrel, it is desirable that the barrel lip (or "crown") always presents exactly the same surface to the spinning tail of the pellet. Ideally, the barrel loses contact with the entire circumference of the tail of the pellet at the same instant so that the pellet is not tipped one way or the other. Tipping the pellet imparts a wobble, increasing the cross-sectional area through the air.\n\nThe wobbling pellet effectively increases its caliber causing more air resistance! This increased area will slow the pellet down more quickly than if it pierced the air perfectly head-on. Many Beeman airguns are "button choked" at the crown of the barrel to assure a perfectly uniform grip on the pellet circumference the instant it leaves the barrel. Others are exquisitely detailed to assure a perfect pellet release. Be sure not to damage the crown of any airgun barrel.\n\n2) UNIFORMITY: Spinning is what keeps a pellet from tumbling, and keeps it facing directly forward as it bores through the air. Robert Beeman has pointed out that if a pellet is the slightest bit unbalanced as it spins, the centrifugal wobble will lurch the pellet off course the instant it leaves the barrel. The direction of that lurch will vary with every shot depending on which direction the excessive mass of the pellet is pointing at the instant it is released from the "hold" of the barrel. This little appreciated factor is one reason Beeman pays such attention to pellet quality control.\n\n3) Wind: Supersonic bullets are more deflected by wind the slower they go. Surprisingly, sub-sonic airgun pellets are less deflected by wind the slower they go, but this seeming anomaly is due to the higher weight of the slower pellet, assuming in this comparison that both are shot out of the same airgun.\n\nFor any airgun, a pellet with a higher "ballistic coefficient" will be less deflected by wind. Generally, heavy pellets have a higher ballistic coefficient than lighter ones. (The ballistic coefficient, or "C-l" of a .20 Laser pellet is 0.0096; of a .20 Kodiak, 0.0167).\n\nIn one test at 60 yards, a .20 Crow Magnum II rifle was able to print a 1.25" group with Kodiak pellets, but only a one-foot group with Laser pellets. The muzzle velocity of the Laser pellet was supersonic, dropping to subsonic 4 yards out of the barrel, the shock of which caused a violent tumbling.\n[B]AIRGUN SHOT REPEATABILITY:[/B]\nAn airgun does not exert the same force from shot to shot. Without such high repeatability, even excellent pellets will not be able to do their job.\n\nAverage pellets may safely exhibit a weight differential of up to a few percent in any one tin. When both pellets and air rifle vary randomly, you will find yourself hitting the target perfectly (on some shots) and miss it completely on others.\n\nEvery airgun user should obtain a tin of ultra-precise pellets to determine just what the airgun is capable of (bench rest), and what the shooter is capable of (hand held). You can use mid-grade pellets for practice, but always use the most accurate pellets you can find for competition and actual hunting. After tramping in the woods for a hour and a half, and stalking a rabbit for 20 minutes, no one will believe it is cost-effective to have finally scared it off with a single missed shot caused by the non-uniformity of a cheap pellet.\n[B]AIR RIFLE HUNTING:[/B]\nTo a varmint hunter, an air rifle is a tool for the job of bagging game. Just as different jobs require different tools (you wouldn''t use a tack hammer to drive 3-penny nails), so do different hunting situations require different air rifles.\n\nThe paramount aspect of hunting air rifles is acceptable downrange accuracy. If you can''t hit your target, no amount of super pellet energy or "penetration" is going to do you any good. Next most important is downrange energy.\nGrackles and other pest birds require one-inch accuracy at 20 to 30 yards; Grey (Tree) squirrels require similar accuracy, but at least 8 ft. lbs. of energy at that distance.\n\nCrows require two-inch accuracy at 40 to 60 yards, the same as "wild" woodchucks, but the chuck requires 10 to 15 ft lbs. of energy at that range, the crows only half that. "Suburban" woodchucks can be approached to within 30 to 40 yards, so a less powerful rifle will do.\n\nAirgun shooters should use this guide to help select the three or four different pellet types that seem closest to answering their own shooting needs. Then shoot these pellets for accuracy to get an idea of how well each type behaves in your own airguns. Shoot into bars of Ivory soap at field ranges to learn how well different pellets penetrate and expand for hunting. There is no substitute for this personal testing which will quickly lead to the selection of the most effective pellet type for your own particular use--and boost your accuracy and shooting satisfaction to new highs.\nArticle reprinted from Beeman Precision Airgun Guide.\n\nI got this article from( [url]http://www.straightshooters.com/general-airgun-information.html[/url])\n\nshared here for information \n[COLOR=#5C3E22][FONT=Arial][/FONT][/COLOR][/LEFT]', ''),

(502984, '470 Nitro Express The 470 Nitro was introduced about 1907 and according to John Tylor, was designed by Joseph Lang. It is another more or less standard caliber of the British gun trade as it was adopted by most rifle makers. It was used mostly in double rifles and was much liked by elephant hunters. Like most cartridges in this group, it originated as a replacement for the 450, which was banned in India and the Sudan for a number of years.\n\n\nThe 470 Nitro was probably the most popular and widely used of the various 470-caliber cartridges. It had pretty of killing power for any of the heavy or dangerous varieties of game and it is potent lion or tiger medicine in a tight spot. Ballistics are almost identical to the 458 Winchester Magnum, but the larger bullet diameter might give it a slight edge. It is, of course, unnecessarily powerful for North American big game. No one turns out bullets or moulds of this caliber and hand-loading would be a problem unless British-made projectiles were available. Federal Crtridge Co. began making loaded ammunition in 1989 using 500-grain solids and soft-points giving 2150 fps and 5130 fpe at the muzzle.

(503205, 'Catastrophic Failure, ALL CARACAL OWNERS PLEASE READ AND BE SAFE [COLOR=#222222][FONT=arial]After having read multiple reviews done of the caracal C and after intensive research I purchased a Caracal C from Buksh Elahi Lahore on Sep 29th 2012. After the initial clean up and testing I started putting it through it''s paces so I could use it as my CC. All the senior members here have stated that at least 500 bullets should be fired from a weapon before it should be considered for defensive carry purposes. In about a months time I had put about 250 [/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=arial]Chinese red box 115 grains[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=arial] rounds through the caracal. All this while I had been meticulously maintaining the weapon, observing it''s wear and tear and cleaning it after every use. \n[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=arial]On November 16th 2012[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#222222][FONT=arial] my brother wanted to accompany me to my farm (about an hour and half from city) and test the weapon out for himself since I had been raving about it. \nI handed my brother the weapon, he fired the first round without any hiccups, I was looking downrange when my brother fired the second round. To my horror right after he fired the round he fell to the ground in a heap. I ran over to him and turned him over.  His face was completely covered in blood. I could make out a hole on top of his eye and blood pouring out of it. For a moment I was paralyzed with fear, thinking the worst, that the projectile had entered his skull. I could only think of his 2 children at the moment in shock. Thankfully in about 10 seconds he started to respond screaming he could not see, I picked him up and took him to the car and started driving back towards the city. In about 5 mins he got his vision back but was still bleeding. The closest hospital was 1 hour away and this drive was one of the most testing times of my life. I had called back to the farm and one of my workers told me the slide had broken in 2 but I was still not sure if anything was lodged inside my brothers skull. \nAfter the tortures drive I got to the hospital and got an X-ray done. I was too scared to look at it myself, legs shaking in terror. I just handed it to the doctor to let him give me the news. To my relief it was a flesh wound and nothing was lodged inside his skull.\nMy brother received 8 stitches and had a severe concussion not to mention a permanent scar on his face. Luckily he fully recovered, if the slide had hit him an inch below he would have lost an eye.\nAfter the incident I emailed Caracal, explaining to them of this incident but got no reply. I wanted to confirm with them if this was a quality control issue or a design fault inherent in all their weapons.\nI have attached pictures of the handgun after I came back the next day and recovered the weapon from where it had fallen. The slide was completely sheared in 2. I had inspected the weapon a day before and it did not even show a slight sign of any wear and tear.\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=arial]Again  I will reiterate, I have been extremely careful with the weapon.  Cleaning it after every use, applying proper lubrication etc. I have  also gone over the incident multiple times in my head, trying to figure  out if I could have prevented this catastrophic incident but I always  come up short.\nI would advise you to please refrain from using this handgun as I would not wish this kind of ordeal even on an enemy.\nStay Safe.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(503027, '22 Winchester Automatic Indroduced for the Winchester Model 1903 semi-auto rifle and never used in any other gun. It is still listed in late ammunition catalogs, but the rifle has been obsolete since 1932. It has a 45-grain inside-lubricated bullet and will not chamber in any standard 22 rimfire gun. It was designed at a time when black and semi-smokeless powder  22 rimfires were still loaded and popular. The purpose was to prevent the use of anything but smokeless powder ammunition in the semi-auto action so as not to foul up the works. Black-powder will gum up such actions and render them inoperable in a very few rounds. Remington brought out a very similar cartridge, but the two are not inter- change able.\n\nThe 22 Winchester Automatic had little to offer over the standard Long Rifle except smokeless powder and the semi-auto rifle it was fired in. In killing power and range it is on par with the 22 Long , even though it has a heavier bullet. The cartridge is no longer listed in current ammunition catalogs.', ''),

Then, if you remember, once the flinching was controlled, remaining shots were mostly bulls and I fell in love there on the spot!\n\nAnyhow, you gave me a a gist to shoot out the Rami after so long, before I decide on it''s fate within my closet.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(503068, '475 Nitro Express British cartridges of 470- to 475-caliber were all practically designed to replace similar 450 calibers because the military banned the 450 in India and the Sudan. Most were introduced between 1905 and 1910, so even if the exact date isn''t established, we know they belonged to that period. The 475 Nitro is one of these. It is straight, rimmed shell intended for single shot or double rifles.\n\nThe 475 Nitro having a 480-grain of bullet with muzzle velocity of 2175 fps and muzzle energy at 5040 fpe, has been considered a gppd general-purpose round for heavy and dangerous game of all types. Experienced hunters liked it for elephant, buffalo or lion at closr range. In power, it is not any different from other cartridges of this class and ballistics are compare-able to the 458 Winchester Magnum. Cartridges of this size have lost favour in recent decades because of the bulk and weight of the rifles involved and because many of the smaller calibers will do just as well. There is no practical use for any of them in the U.S. or for North American big game. Bullets of 475-caliber are not standard in the U.S. and one must obtain British slugs for hand-loading. However, there are two or three 475-caliber wildcat cartridges in existance and Barnes Bullets of American Fork, Utah turns out a 600-grain bullet of this size.

The MBS route covers dozens of residential and commercial localities along the city’s main artery — Ferozepur road linking Lytton road, Jain Mandar, MAO College, Lower Mall, Civil Secretariat, Aiwan-i-Adal, Chowk Katchehry (District Courts), Shrine of Hazrat Data Ganj Bakhsh, Ravi Road and Shahdra town.\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]The route has 27 bus stations, nine of them built on the 8.6km long overhead bridge from Ferozepur Road/ Canal Intersection to Texali.\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]The Traffic Engineering and Planning Agency (TEPA), a subsidiary of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), was entrusted with the task of constructing the MBS, a copy of the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) of Istanbul, in collaboration with Turkish and local experts.\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]Since Turkey was actively facilitating the MBS, it also ensured investment from a leading Turkish firm in providing and operating 45 18-metre long articulated buses (Volvo China) the 27km pathway covered with fences. Platform, a Turkish firm, has been entrusted with the task of running the operational activities.\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, the chief minister said people criticising the spending of “Rs70 to 80 billion” actually didn’t want to see the project which would be of great value to people who have been waiting for hours and travelling in old buses for decades. “As I have already said many a time I tell you again that we have spent only Rs29.8bn on the project which has made the people’s dream of travelling in state-of-the-art buses that never happened in the history of Pakistan,” Mr Sharif said.\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=Arial]The government and the Lahorites took the MBS inauguration like a festive event and a large number of people thronged the route to welcome the inaugural operations right from Gajjumata to Shahdra.

The Fundamentals of Firearm Safety[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]The three basic general rules of safe gun handling.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]Always point the muzzle in a safe direction; never point a firearm at anyone or anything you don''t want to shoot.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]Keep your finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]Keep the action open and the gun unloaded until you are ready to use it.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]II. Additional specific rule[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#333333][FONT=lucida grande]s of safe gun handling\n\nSafety Rules Related to the Shooter and His Behavior.\n\nTreat every firearm as if it were loaded.\n\nNever pass a firearm to another person, or accept a firearm from another person, until the cylinder or action is open and you''ve personally checked that the weapon is completely unloaded.\n\nBefore handling any firearm, understand its operation.\n\nNever rely on any mechanical device for safety.\n\nThink before shooting: once you pull the trigger you can''t take back the shot you''ve just fired!\n\nNever joke around or engage in horseplay while handling or using firearms.\n\nBe alert at all times; never shoot if you''re tired, cold or impaired in any way. Don''t mix alcohol or drugs with shooting.\n\nDon''t sleep with a loaded firearm in your bedroom if you sleepwalk, have nightmares, sleep restlessly or have other sleep problems.\n\nSafeguard your sight, hearing and health. Always wear eye and ear protection. Endeavor to limit your exposure to heavy metal particulates and gases, and minimize your contact with aromatic organic solvents (such as those commonly used in gun cleaning products).\n\nIf you see unsafe behavior any time when firearms are being handled or used, speak up and take action to correct the unsafe behavior at once.\n\nReceive competent instruction from a qualified person before beginning to shoot. If questions arise later, after you''ve been shooting for a period of time, get answers to those questions from a competent authority.\nSafety Rules Related to Your Target.\n\nPositively identify your target and the threat it poses before firing at it.\nWhat''s behind your target? Always make sure that a stray shot, or a bullet which penetrates its intended target through and through, will be safely stopped.\n\nNever shoot at a hard surface, or at water -- your shot may glance off, ricochet and injure someone.\nNever shoot at glass bottles, living trees, or inappropriate targets which would create a hazard for other persons or damage the environment.\n\nNever shoot a rifle or handgun directly upwards, or at a high angle of elevation. Even a rimfire .22 bullet fired at an angle into the air can have enough energy a mile and a half away to accidentally kill someone!\nNever shoot across a highway or other roadway.\n\nNever vandalize a road sign (or other public or private property) by using it as a target.\nNever poach a game animal out of season, or shoot any game animal you don''t intend to eat.\nSafety Rules Related to Your Firearm.\n\nMake sure your firearm is in good mechanical condition before firing it. Periodically have your firearm checked for signs of erosion, cracking, or wear by the factory, by a qualified armorer, or by a factory certified gunsmith.\nNever try to fire a gun which may have a plugged or partially obstructed barrel.\n\nInsure that any modifications made to a firearm are made by a qualified individual, and that those modifications don''t interfere with your firearm''s safety features.\n\nBe sure all accessories, such as holsters and grips, are compatible with the firearm and won''t interfere with its safe operation.\n\nRemember: a backup firearm carried about your person may be highly valuable to you in the event your primary firearm is ever rendered inoperable or is taken from you by an assailant.\n\nIt is your responsibility to insure that your firearm is always either about your person and under your personal control, or positively secured from access by children or other unauthorized parties. Prevent tragedy: lock down your firearms when they aren''t in use.\n\nWhen storing a firearm for a long period of time, consider storing the slide, bolt, or other critical components of the firearm separately under separate lock and key.\n\nNever carry a single action revolver with a round under the hammer unless that revolver is a modern transfer-bar type, equipped with an inertial firing pin.\n\nNever carry a pistol with a round in the chamber unless the pistol has an automatic firing-pin block and/or an inertial firing pin.\n\nGenerally avoid carrying or storing an external hammer-type firearm with its hammer cocked. Exercise extreme care in decocking any external hammer firearm: it is very easy to experience an accidental discharge while doing so if your thumb slips off the hammer.\n\nGenerally avoid unloading a firearm by working the cartridges through the action one-at-a-time; drop the magazine and then eject the round which may be left in the chamber, instead, if possible.\n\nNever use a scope mounted on a firearm as a general purpose spotting scope: while observing an area you may end up accidentally aiming your firearm at fellow hunters, or other non-targets.\n\nAvoid trying to catch a live round (while unloading a semiautomatic pistol) by cupping your hand around the ejection port while retracting the slide; doing so may result in an accidental discharge.\nSafety Rules Related to Ammunition.\n\nBe sure your gun and ammunition are compatible. Shooting incorrect ammunition in a firearm may cause it to be damaged or even make it blow up.\n\nRelying on ammunition which doesn''t feed reliably in your particular firearm may make your firearm malfunction at a critical juncture: get experience with a particular lot of ammunition in your firearm before relying on it for defensive purposes.\n\nUse only ammunition recommended for your firearm by its manufacturer. Never fire ammunition which exceeds industry standard pressure specifications. Over-pressure ammunition will reduce the service life of your handgun, and puts you and those around you at risk of a catastrophic firearm failure.\n\nUse reloaded ammunition judiciously. Be aware that many firearms manufacturers specifically forbid the use of reloaded ammunition in their products, and will void their product''s warranty if you elect to use reloaded ammunition in contravention of their instructions.\n\nAlso remember that a cartridge which has: the wrong powder, no powder charge, or too large a powder charge; an inverted primer, mis-seated primer, the wrong type of primer or an inert primer; a mis-seated, inverted, or mis-sized bullet; a collapsed, weakened, improperly sized or mis-crimped case; incorrect overall length or any of a host of other defects may seriously jeopardize your safety, the safety of those around you, and/or the reliability of your firearm in a defensive situation.\n\nMany shooters prepare and safely use reloaded ammunition each day, and it can be an economical way to stretch your ammunition budget, but the safety of that reloaded ammunition directly depends on the care, components, equipment, and practices used in preparing it.\n\nCarry only one caliber of ammunition when shooting. Accidentally grabbing the wrong ammunition while shooting can result in a shooter or third party being injured, or damage or destruction of a firearm.\nInsure you carry sufficient spare ammunition for your defensive firearm, and make sure you carry it in a readily employable fashion (such as in spare magazines or in speedloaders).\n\nStore ammunition that isn''t being used under lock and key, inaccessible to unauthorized parties and children.\nDispose of unwanted ammunition safely.\n\nSafety Rules Related to Your Firearm''s Holster and Ammo Carrier.\n\nAlways use a holster which is designed for, and which fits, your handgun.\n\nMake sure your holster covers the trigger guard of your handgun.\n\nPurchase a holster which allows you to obtain a secure grip on your handgun while it is still holstered.\nBe sure the thumb break, safety strap, or other firearm retention device on your holster is functional and consistently employed. A good holster should retain your firearm during normal carry and routine physical activity, but no holster can insure that a firearm will be secure against determined attempts at disarmament, or keep a firearm secure during all possible physical activities.\n\nAvoid clip-on holsters and magazine pouches. These carriers may fail to stay clipped to the belt and end up being drawn along with the firearm or the magazine they still hold, thereby interfering with use of the firearm or with timely reloading.\n\nAvoid paddle-style holsters, cross draw holsters, and similar holsters which provide poor weapon retention.\nAvoid ankle holsters, shoulder holsters and other types of holsters which can introduce unnecessary delays in accessing a defensive firearm.\n\nAvoid carrying a defensive firearm in a purse, pocketbook, daypack or briefcase. A firearm carried in that fashion is:\nTypically hard to rapidly access due to the presence of slow-to-open zippers, multiple latches, etc.,\nOften hard to find and draw amidst all the other items routinely carried, since few purses or briefcases include a dedicated handgun-carrying compartment,\nProne to being unavailable when needed, since briefcases, purses and other carriers are routinely set down or put away in a desk drawer where they may or may not be readily accessible and under your physical control,\nUnusually vulnerable to being stolen, since purses, pocketbooks, daypacks and briefcases are prime targets for purse snatchers, pick pockets, muggers and thieves,\nProne to misfunction in an emergency since materials carried along with your handgun in a purse or brief case may gum up the firearm''s mechanism and potentially interfere with its proper operation, and\nLikely to allow your handgun to accidentally become visible to shop clerks, bank tellers or other parties while you are searching for your checkbook or locating a credit card, and that inadvertent exposure may potentially result in a tense situation or even a tragic over-reaction on the part of an individual noticing the firearm and/or summoning law enforcement officers to the scene.\n\nNever carry a handgun tucked into your belt or waistband without a holster (i.e., so-called ``mexican carry''''). A handgun carried in this fashion may be unintentionally dislodged, fall onto a hard surface and accidentally discharge or be damaged. Inside the waistband-type holsters will allow you to obtain the concealment of this type of carry while simultaneously providing vastly improved firearm retention.\n\nAlways employ a proper magazine holder or speed loader carrier to carry your spare ammunition. Select a design that secures and protects your speedloaders or magazines while still making them readily available for use. Avoid ammunition loops and ammo dump boxes.\n\nNever put a partially empty magazine or speedloader back into a magazine carrier or speedloader pouch: only full magazines or full speedloaders belong in a carrier. Partially empty magazines or speed loaders should go into your pocket; empty magazines or speedloaders should be allowed to fall where they''re used during an emergency.\nMiscellaneous Safety Rules.\n\nAt a range, obey the commands of the range officers, or any individual calling `cease fire,'' at once. Read, know and follow any rules peculiar to a particular range which you may be using.\n\nBe careful of hot gases and metal shavings ejected at the forcing cone of a revolver.\n\nKeep your fingers and other parts of your body away from the muzzle, the rear of the \nslide, and the ejection area of a semiautomatic pistol.\n\nIn the event of a misfire, keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction, remove your finger from the trigger, wait ten seconds, then eject the cartridge and dispose of it properly.\n\nIf you hear an unusual sound upon squeezing the trigger or feel an unusual recoil, stop shooting and investigate. You may have experienced a ``squib'''' load (or under-powered cartridge), and it may have caused a bore obstruction. Keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction, remove your finger from the trigger, wait ten seconds, then unload the firearm and safely examine the barrel, checking carefully for any possible obstructions before reloading and resuming shooting.\n\nNever ---\nClimb a tree with a loaded firearm,\nCross a fence with a loaded firearm,\nJump a ditch or ford a stream with a loaded firearm,\nScale or descend a steep incline or hill with a loaded firearm,\nClimb a tree, or climb into a hunting stand with a loaded firearm,\nProp or lean a loaded firearm against a tree or other surface which may allow it to slide, or\nTransport a cased loaded firearm.\nAlways carry your firearms in a way which will allow you to control where the muzzle is pointing, should you stumble or fall.\n\nA ballistic vest may substantially improve your chances of surviving an armed encounter on the street.\nAlways wear a thousand square inches or more of blaze orange while in the field during hunting season.\nBlackpowder (and replica blackpowder) firearms require additional safety precautions not discussed here. Obtain qualified instruction in the safe operation of blackpowder firearms before attempting to load or fire any such firearm.\nCircumstances may require additional safety rules unique to a particular situation.\nIII. Safe Gun Storage.\n\nWhen you are not using your firearm, you should insure that it is store safely. Affirmative measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to a defensive firearm by minors, or firearm theft, include:\nUse of a simplex-type locking box for securing firearms which need to be kept loaded yet available for ready-access defensive use, and Use of trigger locks or padlocks to secure firearms which don''t need to be kept immediately available for defensive use.\n\nAlso note that:\nGun security devices which rely solely on physical strength to secure firearms from unauthorized use are generally undesirable since ingenious children can potentially employ leverage or tools to overcome those devices.\n"Hiding" a firearm won''t secure it from discovery and possible misuse by curious children or intruders.\nMetal gun cabinets or gun safes can be used to safeguard firearms from unauthorized access or theft in many circumstances and metal gun cabinets or gun safes are generally preferable to open racks or glass-front cabinets.\nFirearms should be stored unloaded and separate from ammunition when the firearm isn''t needed for ready-access defensive use.\n\nYou may want to store critical components of a firearm (such as the gun''s bolt or slide) separately from the rest of the firearm when the gun won''t be used in the immediate future.\nConsider engraving your firearms with your social security number, driver''s license number, or concealed firearms license number to deter theft and facilitate return of stolen firearms which may happen to be recovered.\nExplore "gun-proofing" your child by proper training, and by controlled and closely supervised access to firearms to reduce your child''s natural unsatisfied curiosity about firearms.[/FONT][/COLOR][/LEFT][/B]', ''),

(503498, ' I am glad that Bullahdabarda has made a full recovery and that the only permanent damage is a scar.\n\nThis is a dangerous hobby but as my parachuting instructor used to say, we decide how dangerous any activity really is. Proper training, equipment checks and well practised drills for different scenarios reduce the risks to an acceptable level.\n\nIn this case, I do not know what you could have done differently. You mentioned you carried out regular maintenance, the ammo used was the sort that is used widely by enthusiasts and shooting technique, no matter how refined, could not prevent something like this.\n\nWhen it comes to weapon choice, we do live in a country where people purchase weapons that are made in workshops and where material quality is not a major concern and manufacturing quality control is focused, almost entirely, on aesthetics. However, the majority of these weapons is not fired a whole lot and the user profile of the majority is such that we are unlikely to learn of weapons failures and accidents. Last time I was in my village, I came across a youngster in the hujra who had a damaged eye due to a Darraywaal weapon failing with a desi round. But, such incidents are not reported in the press nor make it to Internet forums.\n\nCaracal is a good looking weapon and shoots quite well. The absolute refusal of the manufacturer to make any sort of definitive statement with respect to Pakistan was disappointing when they made a recall in the US. That made me get rid of my Caracal. In this case, also, I understand that they seem to choose to ignore the situation. Anyhow, individuals make their own choices and have different risk profiles. I, for one, intend to stick to manufacturers and designs with reputations that have been established over a number of years. Even so, there will be risks (for e.g., the M9 issues cited in the link posted by a member) but it is about mitigating as many of them as possible and then "tawakkul".', ''),

After several attempts from estimated 15 meters he actually did hit it i too wanted to even the score so i kept on shooting when i shot the last pellet i heard a loud scream we both in a state of shock looked at each other then some thing fell down hard \nwe ran out side and saw a man fall down from his bicycle and was bleeding from his left leg his shalwar was covered in blood and he was screaming to take him to a hospital it happened all so quick we both were traumatized and took him inside , his father for home luckily and he is a skin doctor , quickly he treated him the wound was the size of a chapstick cap but the pellet was lodged inside his skin almost touching his bone they have a small clinic in their home so it was treated well and the person was given some amount . Later after all the scoldings and the confiscation of both the airguns we found out that the pellet actually ricochet from the gate hits the  wall and somehow goes below the gate and hits the person it was very strange for us as the pellet should have stopped when it hit the wall strange as this seems it was a painfull sight to see and if a ricochet 0.177 pellet could do that to a leg guess what can a .22 pellet could do if hit else where or even the 0.177 could be life taking if hit near the neck or stomach \nI advise every one to see whats behind there target left and right and dont treat airguns as toys', ''),

I personally use this same ammo in CZ''s, Glock, Sig, Beretta and in Caracal (although dont own Caracal but shot it with this ammo on many occasions). Never found anything wrong with Chinese red box. \n\nNow coming to over charged issue: after shooting thousands of Chinese red box I found this ammo of very consistent quality and I cannot get my self agree on that whole lot OP purchased can be over charged. If it was one or two rounds even than a gun reacting in such a dangerously weak way has something wrong within, we cannot blame one or two over charged rounds. Specially when this specific firearm has been approved for using rounds charged at 38000psi; secondly a factory produced 32000psi ammo can never be filled (by mistake) to cross 38000psi limit, if it can be at factories like Norinco I will have to quite this sport rather than getting killed by standing at the safest end of a firearm.', ''),

We were concerned that why the incident was reported with two and half months of delay, why the buyer name on the purchase receipt is different than on the provided medical certificate, why the purchase receipt issued by Chaudhry Arms states that the weapon was 9mm F model and the claim was for model C, why the patient didn''t go to a qualified doctor, why the doctor didn;t inform the police regarding this medico legal case and why the email sender is not revealing his contact details. Deeply concerned for the well being of the owner which alledged malfunction of our gun *might* have caused and his lack of reply or any contact details, we went out of our way and contacted the doctor whose report was attached but he couldn''t recall the name or incident, we also contacted the dealer who sold the firearm and even went so far as to send a high level Caracal representative to the address of the buyer in model town as described on the receipt issued by Chaudhry Arms Lahore to address any concerns in person. We also left a note at apparently an empty house (Proof ofconversation with doctor, firearm dealer and pictures of the house of the unfortunate gentleman can be provided to you in person on request). Please understand no other firearmmanufacture in the world cares so deeply for the well being of their customers or provides this level of service. We stand by Caracal''s quality and durability and have complete confidence in our product.

(503571, '40 Smith &amp; Wesson The .40 S&W (10×22mm Smith & Wesson) is a rimless pistol cartridge developed jointly by major American firearms manufacturers Smith & Wesson and Winchester. The .40 S&W was developed from the ground up as a law enforcement cartridge designed to duplicate performance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation''s reduced-velocity 10mm Auto cartridge which could be retrofitted into medium-frame (9mm size) automatic handguns. It uses .40 inch (10.16mm) diameter bullets ranging in weight from 105 to 200 grains (6.8039 g to 13 g).\nIn the aftermath of the 1986 F.B.I. Miami shootout, the F.B.I. started the process of testing 9mm and .45 ACP ammunition in preparation to replace its standard issue revolver with a semi-automatic pistol. The semi-automatic pistol offered two advantages over the revolver: 1) it offered increased ammunition capacity, and 2) it was easier to reload during a firefight. The F.B.I. was satisfied with the performance of its .38 Special +P 158 gr (10.2 g) L.S.W.C.H.P. (lead semi-wadcutter hollowpoint) cartridge ("F.B.I. Load") based on decades of dependable performance. Ammunition for the new semi-automatic pistol had to deliver terminal performance equal or superior to the .38 Special F.B.I. Load. The F.B.I. developed a series of practically oriented tests involving eight test events that reasonably represented the kinds of situations that F.B.I. agents commonly encounter in shooting incidents.\n\nDuring tests of the 9mm and .45 ACP ammunition, the F.B.I. Firearms Training Unit''s Special Agent-in-Charge John Hall decided to include tests of the 10mm cartridge, supplying his personally owned Colt Delta Elite 10mm semi-automatic, and personally handloaded ammunition. The F.B.I.''s tests revealed that a 170–180 gr (11–12 g) JHP 10mm bullet, propelled between 900–1,000 ft/s (270–300 m/s), achieved desired terminal performance without the heavy recoil associated with conventional 10mm ammunition (1,300–1,400 ft/s (400–430 m/s)). The F.B.I. contacted Smith & Wesson and requested it to design a handgun to F.B.I. specifications, based on the existing large-frame S&W Model 4506 .45 ACP handgun, that would reliably function with the F.B.I.''s reduced velocity 10mm ammunition. During this collaboration with the FBI, S&W realized that downsizing the 10mm full power to meet the F.B.I. medium velocity specification meant less powder and more airspace in the case. They found that by removing the airspace they could shorten the 10 mm case enough to fit within their medium-frame 9mm handguns and load it with a 180 gr (12 g) JHP bullet to produce ballistic performance identical to the FBI''s reduced velocity 10mm cartridge. S&W then teamed with Winchester to produce a new cartridge, the .40 S&W. It uses a small pistol primer whereas the 10mm cartridge uses a large pistol primer.\n\nThe .40 S&W cartridge debuted January 17, 1990, along with the new Smith & Wesson Model 4006 pistol, although it was several months before the pistols were available for purchase. Austrian manufacturer Glock Ges.m.b.H. beat Smith & Wesson to the dealer shelves in 1990, with pistols chambered in .40 S&W (the Glock 22 and 23) which were announced a week before the 4006. Glock''s rapid introduction was aided by its engineering of a pistol chambered in 10mm Auto, the Glock 20, only a short time earlier. Since the .40 S&W uses the same bore diameter and case head as the 10mm Auto, it was merely a matter of adapting the 10mm design to the shorter 9×19mm Parabellum frames. The new guns and ammunition were an immediate success.\n\nThe .40 S&W case length and overall cartridge length are shortened, but other dimensions except case web and wall thickness remain identical to the 10mm Auto. Both cartridges headspace on the mouth of the case. Thus in a semi-auto they are not interchangeable. Fired from a 10mm pistol the .40 Smith & Wesson cartridge will headspace on the extractor and the bullet will jump a .142 inch freebore just like a .38 Special fired from a .357 Magnum pistol. If the cartridge is not held by the extractor, the chances for a ruptured primer are great. Smith and Wesson does make a double action revolver that can fire either at will using moon clips. A single-action revolver in the .38–40 chambering can also be modified to fire the .40 or the 10 mm if it has an extra cylinder. Most .40 caliber handguns can be easily converted to 9mm for cheaper target shooting with a simple barrel and magazine swap.\nThe .40 S&W cartridge has been popular with law enforcement agencies in the United States, Canada, and Australia. While possessing nearly identical accuracy, drift and drop, it has an energy advantage over the 9×19mm Parabellum, and with a more manageable recoil than the 10 mm Auto cartridge. Marshall & Sanow (and other hydrostatic shock proponents) contend that with good JHP bullets, the more energetic loads for the .40 S&W can also create hydrostatic shock in human-sized living targets.\n\nBased on ideal terminal ballistic performance in ordnance gelatin during lab testing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the .40 S&W earned status as "the ideal cartridge for personal defense and law enforcement". Apart from the imperfect relationship between ordnance gelatin ballistics and actual stopping power, critics pointed to the reduced power of the round compared with the 10 mm Auto it was based on. Ballistically the .40 S&W is almost identical to the .38-40 Winchester introduced in 1874, as they share the same bullet diameter, bullet weight, and similar muzzle velocity. The energy of the .40 S&W exceeds standard-pressure .45 ACP loadings, generating between 350-foot-pound (470 J) and 500-foot-pound (680 J) of energy, depending on bullet weight. Both the .40 S&W and the 9 mm Parabellum operate at a 35,000 psi (240 MPa) SAAMI maximum, compared to a 21,000 psi (150 MPa) maximum for .45 ACP.\n\n.40 S&W pistols with standard (not extended) double-stack magazines can hold as many as 18 cartridges, such as the Les Baer H.C. 40. While not displacing the 9 mm Parabellum, the .40 S&W is commonly used in law enforcement applications in keeping with its origin with the FBI. Select U.S. special operations units, have available the .40 S&W and .45 ACP for their pistols. The United States Coast Guard, having dual duties as maritime law enforcement and military deployments, has adopted the SIG Sauer P229R DAK in .40 S&W as their standard sidearm.\n\nThe .40 S&W was originally loaded at subsonic velocity (around 980 ft/s (300 m/s)) with a 180 grain bullet. Since its introduction, various loads have been created, with the majority being either 155 gr (10.0 g), 165 gr (10.7 g) or 180 gr (12 g). However, there are some bullets with weights as light as 135 grain and as heavy as 200 gr (13 g). Cor-Bon and Winchester both offer a 135 gr (8.7 g) JHP and Cor-Bon also offers a 140 gr (9.1 g) Barnes XPB hollow-point. Double Tap Ammo, based out of Cedar City, Utah loads a 135 gr (8.7 g) Nosler JHP, a 155 gr (10.0 g), 165 gr (10.7 g) and 180 gr (12 g) Speer Gold Dot hollow-point (marketed as "Bonded Defense"), a 180gr Hornady XTP JHP, and three different 200gr loads included a 200 gr (13 g) Full Metal Jacket (FMJ), a 200 gr (13 g) Hornady XTP JHP and Double Tap''s own 200 gr (13 g) WFNGC (Wide Flat Nose Gas Check) hard cast lead bullet; the latter specifically designed for hunting and woods carry applications.', ''),

(503620, '22 ILARCO 22 Short Magnum Rimfire The 22 ILARCO Rimfire originated in about 1987 and was manufactured by Winchester for Illinois Arms Company. It is the 22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire shortened to the same length as the 22 Long Rifle. It was chambered in the Illinois Arms Company''s Model 180 auto/semi-auto rifle that features a 165-round drum-type magazine. The full auto version was available only to law enforcement agencies. The reason for the shorter cartridge was that the Model 180 was designed for the 22 Long Rifle and the action would not handle the 22 WMR. Illinois Arms Company has been bought out by Feather Industries of Boulder, Colorado and according to company officials the 22 ILARCO is to be discontinued. The cartridge is also referred to as the 22 WMR Short.\n\nShortening the 22 WMR makes more sense that it might first appear, even though there is some velocity loss. For one thing, the short case uses the same jacketed bullet as the parent cartridge and dosen''t pick up dirt and debris the way the outside-lubricated 22 Long Rifle can. With a 165-round magazine and the full auto fire, this is a matter of some importance. Also, the 22 WMR is too long to function in practically all current 22 semi-auto pistols, but many of these could be adapted to fire the 22 ILARCO. However, as things stand at the moment, the cartridge is more apt to end up as strictly a collector''s item.', ''),

(503635, '476 Nitro Express This appears to have been a Westley Richards development introduced in 1907, with a 520-grain bullet leaving the muzzle at 2100 fps and energy of 5085 fpe at muzzle. It was used in single and double guns, but was not as popular as others of the same class. It is currently obsolete and no one makes rifles in this caliber, except possibly on special order.\n\nNothing much can be said about the 476 that hasn''t already been mentioned about other cartridges in the same category. They are all nearly identical in power and what one does, the others can duplicate. The 476 is considered adequate for any and all African or Indian big game. Its ballistics are similar to the 458 Winchester Magnum, although it has the advantage of a larger diameter bullet. (Some might consider that a disadvantage.) Bullet diameter is so close to .500-inch that, 50-caliber cast bullets could very likely be swagged down and used. Hand-loading data not developed.', ''),

I''ve always been fascinated by firearms and cameras (they both shoot!) However I chose to pick up the camera first since I''m against hunting for sport.\n\nI''ve been a decent shot since a kid, first with my Gamo air-pistol  and later on in my early 20''s moving into skeet shooting for a bit. Didnt do it much but I have a fair idea of gun handling.\n\nI''m not looking for a firearm to shoot with from my rooftop on New Year''s, nor do i plan on snatching mobiles or rob banks :-D\n\nOn the contrary, living in Khi, I''m pretty tired of being mugged out of hard earned money and valuables and hearing stories of burglaries and robberies in my neighbourhood and would rather be proactive about it and protect my family (not that my Rottweiler doesn''t do a good job, but still).\n\nI had my All-Pakistan License and carrying permit made back in 2005 thru a political agent, Malakand but never really "bought" or owned a gun before, and wish to change that now.\n\nHad my license checked and I''ve been told that its fine and that the PO can be renewed and a new 144 obtained.\n\nMy Ordeal:\n\nI''m confused between the variety out there.

(503665, ' Salam All,\nI will try to be brief and concise.  I have just walked in the door of my house and have been doing a bit of research work on the pc before doing my posting.  What I post here and now is going to be a continuation due to the fact that I have advised the owner of the Caracal to do which is to take the slide to a testing facility for TWO main tests: Hardness and manufacturing (NOTHING THAT WILL CHANGE OR FURTHER DAMAGE OR SCRATCH the broken Caracal).  If I come up short somewhere, please do post question(s) but wait till tomorrow till I am rested up.  I have been up since 7am running all over Lahore today before my travel to home in RWP.  I also upon getting the news from fellow member RMISHAQ (++1 for telling me in time) wanted to visit KKhan8 as this thing affects us all.\n\nThere is something else that needs to be understood here CLEARLY.  This is NOT an issue of where the gun was purchased; nor is it an issue of who or what is being alleged.  It is a question of - Is there an inherent design failure that we have stumbled upon with the Caracal?  Or if not then simply put Did the gun fail or was it due to some other negligent use?  So please I say this to ALL - stop with the finger pointing and lets get to the nitty gritty - WHAT AND/OR WHO is at fault?  The thing that does get me personally winded up about Caracal is that their response goes on about the gun being purchased from someone else and then goes on about police reports and what ever and what ever.... HEY CARACAL DUDE???  Are you telling me that I have to have purchased a Caracal from an authorized dealer ONLY for you to warrant YOUR product?  Meaning if someone sells me a Caracal it is automatically not warranteed?  If I find a Caracal on the ground somewhere AND its brand new unused in box, Caracal will not warranty THEIR manufactured product?  Sir, hope you will read this and understand the underlying implications of these questions and such as they regard your company''s future sales of Caracals anywhere.\n\nSo here goes,  I went to KKhan8''s office, firstly, I met with his brother, mind you they are NOT some pindoos - rather well educated people AND WELL TO DO People.  The scar with dent on the forehead is very real, its very visible and noticeable and won''t be going away... EVER.  By the grace of God, he was spared a lifetime of misery if the slide had been an inch lower.  On the bright side of all this mess, I guess he will never be firing handguns again... rather sticking to what he loves most which is skeet shooting.\n\nFellow PG members, the slide break was:\n-NOT due to improper ammo - there was NO swelling of barrel, chamber, marring of the slide, dings, scratches, dents, slight broken pieces, chipping, rusting, NOTHING.\n-Barrel is still in its form - those that were hinting as to it looking bent... let me correct you all - it is NOT bent it is true and true to form the gun has been HARDLY used as the top and the bottom end of the barrel towards the muzzle side is still mostly black (blued).  There are no signs of swells or cracks or pits or gouges or excess fouling or scratches inside the barrel.  The barrel rifling is like new.  The barrel lug was also un-damaged.\n-Magazines - ALL magazines showed no bends, cracks, breaks, deviations, chips, dirt; they were NIB.\n-Frame/Receiver - aside from the slide release (not slide lock) being a little gritty there is nothing in the frame that was out of order from my observation.  The rear pin holding the internal frame was slightly deviated.  The locking block was fine there was no chipping, peening or any other damaging word I can think of.  The rails were in proper alignment, not bent or outta shape.  There was NOTHING wrong with the frame.\n\nSLIDE - the break is very clear, there are no visible areas showing cracks, manufacturing bubbles.  The area around the break itself is not swollen.  There is no visible dents, dings, scratches, rust, other cracks, slight small shavings, chippings etc... Its a clean break in the slide and its broken on both sides clean with out showing any stress stretch marks on or around the affected area.  The slide aside from that is still like new.  One can probably use glue and put it back together there is not visible piece missing.  It just broke.

The failure was due to.... manufacturing process and design.  To further solidify my conclusion I have also strongly recommended two tests done by the owners for MY verification purposes.  \n1.  I want the slide hardness tested - the harder the metal the more prone to breakage due to brittleness.\n2.  The manufacturing process - This is very important how was the slide manufactured.  Was it forged then CNC machined?  Was it Investment Casted (NOT RECOMMENDED)?  Was it Powder Metallurgy Process ((Call it by any other proprietary name its still the same thing) NOT RECOMMENDED) - I [U]believe[/U] after looking at it that it was manufactured via this process?  Was it Die Casted (Again a big NO NO)?  WHAT IS IT?\nAs I had stated prior in my Caracal F project most items seem to have been casted and others stamped to make a very inexpensive gun.  But there are something that are a NO NO when doing this... high stress areas should NEVER be casted due to a number of hazards: bubbles within structure is a big issue for one, there are also structural issues.  And I don''t think that Caracal slides are ALL checked via Xrays for structural faults. \nAlso please don''t think or state that well my Caracal came with a different serial number so I am safe... yeah right.  Anyone who really thinks that please see me about purchasing amazing BEACH FRONT Property in Islamabad....\nThe owners are NOT at fault here.  Fault lies with the company product.  Caracal, the ball is in your court now; do the right thing(s).\n\nMy own little comment/story regarding consumer affairs - In 1986, I owned a Glock 17L ported (actually I owned two!  LOLZ).  One day while I was doing double tap drills for my IPSC match, I fired a round which didn''t really sound right but the gun cycled weakly and had chambered another round which my damn finger ignited before my brain could stop it.  The gun gave one heck of a jerk but froze in the initial cycle start.  I tried to move  the slide but it was jammed.  I hammered the slide in place so I could remove the slide off the frame which still took forever.  I saw that the barrel was swollen and stuck in the slide.... ok no problem, fault is mine I used for the first time in the US something called RE-manufactured ammo.  So I called Glock to find out the damages incurred.  They were helpful, they asked me to send the gun back.  They did NOT ask me for receipt, or how I came to own or anything like that... It was simple - Glock - their gun - their product - me consumer...  I sent it to them expecting to pay atleast three hundred dollars on repairs.... I got a BRAND NEW GUN in return for FREEEEEEEEEE.  No pooh paah, no nig nags, no this and that, no apologies, no call backs, just straight forward here you go a new piece.  I will say this is the reason that even though I can''t get Glocks service in Pakistan... But then again there is always hope... I will ALWAYS own a Glock.\n\nTo be Cont..', ''),

The slide looks like if 2 pieces been glued up together and just falling apart!!!! Shocking!!!\n\nThings are quite clear to me, as I''ve personally seen something like this happen to me some 2 decades ago with a locally manufactured handgun. The hammer broke into 2 pieces by the force of my thumb when pulling it back after a string of 7 shots and it''s a nightmare still when I recall what would have happened to my face and eyes, had the magazine capacity been 8 instead of 7!!!!\n\nThis is no ammo related issue, crap! It''s about the metallurgy involved and it''s a serious failure of the handgun, requiring a prompt response from Caracal UAE.\n\nMoreover, it''s not only about compensating the unfortunate owner of this particular handgun, but about reinstating the shattered confidence of thousands of Caracal users around the globe. You carry a handgun for your defense requirements, not to be "slide-fired" back by the handgun itself! This is no ordinary "kaboom" due to use of wrong ammo or having a preceding projectile stuck, it''s plain "FAILURE"!\n\nFinally, I hope Caracal people stay engaged here and come up with something positive. The incident itself cannot be reverted, I agree, but Caracal CAN........back to it''s pre-2005 status as non-existing!\n\nI personally would be careful about my Caracal from now on till the matter is finalized.

I remember that I bought an old kyocera digital camera as second hand without any receipt or warrenty from Hall Road. Its lense protrude out of body about 1" when switched On, and one needed to be careful that there is no hinderance in operation in front of lense, like hand or fingures. Months later, a plastic gear that help lense protrude broke as lense tried to came out but way was blocked by holding hand. Some days before Orient in Gawalmindi has taked dealership of Kyocera and started selling new models. I went to them with camera, they did not asked for any receipt or anything, just returned me the battery and took my number. Afetr 2 months they called and asked me to visit. I went there and presented by a new camera in replacement of later model, without battery as it was already returned. I thanked the representative and was astinished!!! But this is how Japanese & Swiss brands are called alternate name of Quality. \r\n\r\nIn case fault is in manufecturing or mattelergy, as pointed out; and if caracal follows best practice, they should put on hold current manufecturing operation, call back all sold pieces or arrange quality inspection/fault finding locally whereever they are sold, through X-Ray and other NDT techniques, improve/replace their manufecturing processes, apply state of art QC & QA processes, start operations again, replace all faulty pieces with fresh ones and be causcious in future.\r\n\r\nIf they overlooked, God forbid, any more incidents such like this happen, in west in particular, will damage their repute and cause irrevocable loss.

The boy had an unloaded gun and ammunition in his backpack, Horsley said.\nThe boy waved the gun at others during a morning recess, school officials said. Other students, however, didn''t report the threat until classes were nearly finished for the day. There was no immediate explanation for the delay, authorities said.\nAuthorities have not released the child''s name. The .22-caliber handgun had been left at the boy''s home by a relative, Horsley said.\nThe child made statements to administrators and mentioned the shooting rampage last week in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children dead, authorities said.\nThe boy told others his parents sent him to school with the gun for protection, which his parents adamantly deny, Horsley said.\n"The family is rocked by this. They have been very forthcoming," Horsley said.\nThe boy was expected to be charged in juvenile court Tuesday, Horsley said.\n"This kid made a mistake, and he knows it," Horsley said. "He feels bad about it, and his parents are cooperating with the investigation. He will not be coming back to this school."\nNo one was injured.\nTwo other Utah schools were dealing with rumors of gun possession by students that turned out to be false, underscoring fears spread by the Connecticut shooting.\nSeparately, Utah''s attorney general-elect, John Swallow, said he planned to make school safety a high priority and that fortifying schools might be one solution.\n"When we had the issue with the airliners, for example, we strengthened the cockpit doors so that terrorists on the plane couldn''t get through to the pilot," Swallow told The Associated Press.\nGranite School District officials said they have a high level of security compared to other Utah schools. The district employs its own police force with 16 armed officers on patrol, plus school resource officers who are off-duty police officers.', ''),

If Toyota realizes it''s mistake and issues a recall for Corolla''s what it means is the company is recognizing it''s mistake and the consumers benefit by getting a ''fixed'' or a better product. Would you throw away your car or try to get it fixed ?\n\nMy role in this entire thing is to get Caracal''s attention and negotiate with them so that the Pakistani Gun Community members which own Caracal C''s get maximum benefit. If I don''t then we have seen the results other brothers were getting. I would like very much that everyone that has spent their hard earned money on buying a reliable firearm for self defence gets just that, a reliable firearm for self defence. \n\n@ALL Brothers please feel free to criticise and say anything about Caracal that you like. Just try to do it in a manner which is beneficial for our community and Caracal C owners. \n\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\n\nIt must feel really good being the ultimate arbiter of what is ''unbecoming'', my friend. Too bad your admin powers do not extend to website of the UAE daily "The National". Extending your example, if Toyota makes a recall in the US and does not even so much as make a statement as to whether the Toyotas sold in Pakistan may possibly have the same issues; and, if Toyota, after (say) a particular Corolla sold in Pakistan accelerated instead of stopping when the brakes were applied, ignored the issue altogether then, yes, I would consider it wise to avoid Toyotas.

The mechanism seems to be "sensitive" to many factors in the hands of the user.\n\nI agree with both of you that it''s easy to shoot it out more accurately, enabling better shot placements as a vital factor to neutralize any threatening object, but it''s the no-confidence in the reliability sector of the cycling process itself that keeps away many seasoned people from the .22 platform, deeming it a fun gun and no serious business item, only.\n\nLet me know on background of above perception, which guns from this platform you deem fit to carry as primary SD weapon, is the Walther P-22 a reliable handgun?

I have been reading things here for last couple of days. No doubt I am as horrified as anyone else and this is why it was me who tried to reach to Mr. Khan''s house on the first day when we received the mail and that address we received only from that purchase receipt because Mr. Khan didn''t proide any address / contact where he can be contacted. I am sure when you or brother moeen went to make a claim either it was through phone or through personal atleast you have revealed your identity. You didn''t send an email or made a call without providing your details. The receipt of purchase from Chaudhry Arms was discussed because that was the only proof of purchase provided by Mr. Khan. And now talking about where you got the caracal, it is caracal - i think we should not forget about the documented history where the several police departments of this country has purchased Glocks and then they were replaced by the local made Glock and being in the intelligence I know who has played what kind of rolls in making the Glock molds / copies in pakistan and how many glocks of local made are out there. Also further more we should always remember that we comment on something if to no one else we always owe to our own intelligence and intellect. The request to fly the brother khan to Dubai was made to learn from him what has happened so first the right analysis can be done and secondly if required with his inputs the improvements can take place but using this productive offer as an offer of disguise is something doesn''t suit any educated community or forum. \n\n\n[QUOTE=Mujtaba;341829][COLOR=#333333]to be honest, I find the offer by CARACAL for a replacement handgun and/or a trip to UAE insulting at best. a POS handgun and a measly air-ticket for a near death experience? is this how much human life is valued at CARACAL? this figures the quality of their firearm, I am sorry to say.\n[/COLOR][COLOR=#333333]look on the bright side: it is established without a doubt that "CARACAL is deadly at both ends"[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]\n[/COLOR]\nwell said 12guage bro[/QUOTE]', ''),

My Dear Brother - kindly without being offended I will request to read what Dr. Kaiser has written in his response before making such comments. We always respected this forum not only because this forum is not only known for people who keeps the gun community vibrant but also they are all educated people who are known for their productive conversations. The offer to fly Mr. Khan to Dubai was in the text that our technical team can leaarn from the horse mouth for what has exactly happened so if needed the improvements can be done on priority basis. I know very well that Mr. Khan is a well off individual because I have visited his house several times myself to find him so we can talk and learn about his claim. Each time i found several covered heavy bikes and 2 cars with no human in the house. \nI am the one who called upon that doctor several times and finally was able to talk to learn tht he doesn''t know about the incident. I will ask you something - now be honest and reply. If you receive an email reporting such an incident without any contact address and when you reply to that email you don''t hear anything back what would you do ? \n\nNow, we diddn''t criticize why Mr. Khan brought this matter to the forum. Instead within 24 hours still without knowing the actual identity of the person we offered through this forum to take swift action for most important thing which is to know the cause by internationally qualified people and then take actions accordingly. Is that something bad we have done. Now, if dr. kaiser has said that i request mr khan to travel to dubai at his own expenses or as it happens in pakistan '' we will draw a committee which will look into the matter '' is that the response you have wanted ? Brother, the legal cases are always an option to everyone and here we are talking about caring for the community and specially this forum.

I am sure when you or brother moeen went to make a claim either it was through phone or through personal atleast you have revealed your identity. You didn''t send an email or made a call without providing your details. The receipt of purchase from Chaudhry Arms was discussed because that was the only proof of purchase provided by Mr. Khan. And now talking about where you got the caracal, it is caracal - i think we should not forget about the documented history where the several police departments of this country has purchased Glocks and then they were replaced by the local made Glock and being in the intelligence I know who has played what kind of rolls in making the Glock molds / copies in pakistan and how many glocks of local made are out there. Also further more we should always remember that we comment on something if to no one else we always owe to our own intelligence and intellect.

My Dear Brother - before anything else please know that I am as horrified as you are about this exxtremly unfortunate incident and i am so thanksful to God that your brother is Alhamdulillah safe and healed now. My dear brother I really wished you had contacted us right after the incident with all your details so by now we could have thoroughly looked at the problem, found our the right reasoning and could have taken the proper actions. Brother - it seems like you didn''t receive the email sent to you by Dr. Kaiser which was sent to you on the 31st of Jannuary. If you like i can post all that email here or can send you to your inbox again. Brother, I am sure that you have your reasons to keep the incident to yourself for more than two months and also the reasons for not providing us your contact / phone numbers where we could contact you but my dear brother please understand our point of view. Caracal being the first competitive weapon which is posing the serious threats to euorpeans and americans manufactured by an islamic country and who''s posing a serious threat to the western agenda receives many emails with not only pictures done in photo shop but also masterly done videos which shows carcal has blasted the world. I am sure you are aware that the Glock has banned the commercial sale to Pakistanis and we all know why. This is their way to state that we are not worthy to carry their weapon. Now Caracal which is posing a serious threat to Glock is not only seeling the weapons in the Pakistani market but also exploring many ways to support the gun community of pakistan. Keeping all this in mind when we received the mail from you without any contacts and with some serious descrepencies which I am sure you probably have just over looked something and even over looked somethings in your this posting. If you are aware that your previous receipt which you have sent to caracal was from Chaudhry arms and it was for 9mm F model and the claim in the email was for caracal c model, now in this post you have mentioned that the caracal c was bought from baksh Elahi. And many other things were not matching with each other. Keeping all the above in mind - and after not hearing from you through mail reply we still didn''t just sit around. Like i said earlier, I went to your house (i dont want to post the pictures here for your security reasons but I have taken the pics of your house even which I have with me), I spoke to doctor who prompted in a fishy manner, I really had no way of contacting you. So my dear brother please take this out of your mind that we didn''t make efforts. I have just learned that you have spent most of your life abroad and therefore you might not aware of lot of the facts what is really going on here in the weaponary indusrty. I am sure you have an idea that the branded ammo being manufactured in several places in pakistan, every weapon including Glock, Bretta, and i am sure Carcal is also beign copied here. Its unfortunate but we live in a country where the entire bealt is manufacturing arms almost in every house. Serving for some intensive intelligence agencies I know many people who are even well respected in the guns community but I know from where they got their molding done for various international brands and how they not only dupped the customers but also brought the bad name for the country. Having said that - I think the challenges here are to look in to the weapon and ammo in details and by the internationally recognized experts, then get the right findings and determine if this was an isloted incident or it has affected the whole batch and then do the right things accordingly to protect our users. I would like you to contact brother Abbas - the chief here with your contact details so I can reach you and we can sit together to start the joint actions on priority basis. Regards,', ''),

They don''t *have* to do anything. We are not the U.S or Europe that we''ll take them to court and all the media will cover it nor are our sales numbers that large. Our courts are screwed up, the law is on the side of the wealthy (read Multimillion USD company) and the media has bigger issues to report and has the memory of a goldfish. Caracal can just ignore it and be on their way. If hard pressed they''ll pull out of Pakistan. If the issue comes up internationally they will just claim the gun was a fake copy from... wait for it... PAKISTAN.. which has a track record of replicating anything we can Glocks, Beretta''s whatnot.. And everyone will go aaahh.. that explains it.. those Pakistani''s and their fake shit.. Who will prove what ? and where ? \n\nAnyway the damage has been done, a free pistol and a trip to Dubai, no questions asked sounded pretty damn good to me. It was my idea and on my word that Caracal offered it (thanks for trashing that btw 12G as a bribe from Caracal). This is Pakistan, no one is getting a million and a half USD because a gun blew up in their hands. Which firearm manufacturer has offered any compensation let alone a trip to their factory in the history of Pakistani Firearm ownership ??\n\nMore importantly on a large issue I was following up with Caracal getting free replacement parts for any faulty pistols before the SHTF at the Caracal thread. \n\nKhair, this new deal that I worked out after two hours of sar khappai is all I can do.

I agree with what Moeen bhai said tht it doesn''t matter where the gun was purchased, it was a ligit Caracal product that failed. Plain and simple. Now about the offer that Caracal made. When Moeen bhai said...\n\n[QUOTE=Moeen;341771]\nMy own little comment/story regarding consumer affairs - In 1986, I owned a Glock 17L ported (actually I owned two!  LOLZ).  One day while I was doing double tap drills for my IPSC match, I fired a round which didn''t really sound right but the gun cycled weakly and had chambered another round which my damn finger ignited before my brain could stop it.  The gun gave one heck of a jerk but froze in the initial cycle start.  I tried to move  the slide but it was jammed.  I hammered the slide in place so I could remove the slide off the frame which still took forever.  I saw that the barrel was swollen and stuck in the slide.... ok no problem, fault is mine I used for the first time in the US something called RE-manufactured ammo.  So I called Glock to find out the damages incurred.  They were helpful, they asked me to send the gun back.  They did NOT ask me for receipt, or how I came to own or anything like that... [B]It was simple - Glock - their gun - their product - me consumer...  I sent it to them expecting to pay atleast three hundred dollars on repairs.... I got a BRAND NEW GUN in return for FREEEEEEEEEE.  No pooh paah, no nig nags, no this and that, no apologies, no call backs, just straight forward here you go a new piece.[/B]  I will say this is the reason that even though I can''t get Glocks service in Pakistan... But then again there is always hope... I will ALWAYS own a Glock.\n\nTo be Cont..[/QUOTE]\n\nthat he returned the gun back and he got a ''[B]NEW ONE for FREEEE'' [/B]we say wow what a company. They care so much for their customers. But when Caracal made the same offer toping it with the [B]FREEE TRIP[/B] to UAE. We find that [B]INSULTING? [/B]So what are they suppose to do then. Burn down their Company??? Faulty thing do get made in amnufacturing process. The web is full of Glocks and Berettas exploding. \n[QUOTE=12GAUGE;341824]\n\nto be honest, I find the offer by CARACAL for a replacement handgun and/or a trip to UAE  insulting at best. a POS handgun and a measly air-ticket for a near death experience? is this how much human life is valued at CARACAL? this figures the quality of their firearm, I am sorry to say.\n\nlook on the bright side: it is established without a doubt that "CARACAL is deadly at both ends". lols!\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Mujtaba;341829][COLOR=#333333]to be honest, I find the offer by CARACAL for a replacement handgun and/or a trip to UAE insulting at best. a POS handgun and a measly air-ticket for a near death experience? is this how much human life is valued at CARACAL? this figures the quality of their firearm, I am sorry to say.\n[/COLOR][COLOR=#333333]look on the bright side: it is established without a doubt that "CARACAL is deadly at both ends"[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]\n[/COLOR]\nwell said 12guage bro[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=Mujtaba;341842]n i think thts nt enough to offer new gun n wat some of members are saying here A TRIP  its z sought of offer to solve de matter under de table kind of a thing ...it z de matter of some one''s life  \ni will lil bit disagree with abbas bhai. even though he z saying realistic things (apologies abbas bhai )\nbut [B][COLOR=#ff0000]court option shd be considered[/COLOR][/B] ....it il set example for all.  may be kkhan il hav all de goin to court again n again (khawari) but it il be a good example for all new firearm manufacturers  to make sure their product are reliable enough to be in consumers hand n nt cost him any loss which cant be fulfilled by anything tangible or intangible , atleast it il alarm de company''s top level management  to make any decision like recalling all this products of  ths production which hv been made off same powder which moeen bhai is talkin abt  n things like this  .\n\nkkhan shd do this[/QUOTE]\n\nAgain guys i''m not taking Caracals side.

UAE govt is strict and particular when it comes to meet the international standards and in field of life , and very much sure about this that caracal is part of govt holdings and their involvement is very much there so for sure they will have the best of the best people to be on board.

It will serve greater good of us all. Don''t offer any wrong advices! What Khans will loose if Caracal will  dodge? The weapon? That is alreay lost. The money? They have already spent (on medical). The stress through which they have gone through. They woud not loose any further. But Caracal will loose a lot. They will not dodging us but will be dodging themselves. But if Khans act upon members'' advices, they will just delay the process and will have to spend much more and go through stress, just to make a silly point that they were right.\n\nI am telling you by experience of our judicial system (have faced court cases and son of a High Court Lawyer), if Caracal has any malafide intention, it would be lot easy for Caracal to contest case here and end result will be nothing.

(504093, ' Salam Friends & Fellows, this discussion got heated and went a long way. I am writing following lines and think that good sense will prevail. I suggest this issue be addressed with three goals, to set objectivity, bring rationality and find better solution in three phases. \n\n1. Relief: Caracal should compensate the grieved consumer by upholding their offer "any 9mm gun in replacement". (Both parties and Sir Abbass as moderator can resolve in no time)\n2. Fact Finding: Non Destructive Testing as its name suggests does not cause any change or modification in piece of evidance. Initially it should be conducted by NCNDT through a panel of Pakguns seniors (no need to ask manufecturer to do that locally if otherwise possible), and detarmine reasons of failure. This will satisfy our curious brains as well as develop a laison with NCNDT for future finding. This best practice will help in forensics as well in future (capacity building of the agency). Than the evidance/piece be handed over to Manufecturer to conduct their tests at their own facility. They may share results publically. (Pakguns esteemed experts (e.g. Skeeter60, Sir Moeen & 12Gauge), NCNDT, Manufecturer, Consumer)\n3. Further actions & Lessons Learnt: \n(a). If fault is unique to this gun/piece, technical details should be released for satisfaction of other customers/possessors. Medical expenses should be compensated by manufecturer.\n(b). If found that other guns may also have faults, a recall should be made by manufecturer.\n(c).  Guidlines & SoPs can be defined for other manufecturers marketing & selling in Pakistan through community/consumer forum & association. This will assure compliance by other manufecturers like china, turkey, germany etc to ensure warrenty claims & make possible replacement/parts. This is how comunities and consumer watch dog associations are formed and get stronger. It is not question that why such trends are not here. Once community is awakened, they can claim their rights.

Caracal wont do us any favour if they provide us customer service, its their duty(which they promised to perform).[/QUOTE]\n\nBro! Bro! Bro!\n\nI am answering just for information sake. Please do not take it offensive.\n\nThey say that batches imported in Pakistan are not faulty. Now what do you say? We also don''t have any proof to prove this. But they say that they will replace parts Voluntarily. And what I got from their response is that the parts have landed in Pakistan and waiting for custom clearance. You know how our custom / government departments.\n\nRegarding stop using or buying Caracal. I think we have done that.\n\nNow Brother think that is it their crime to establsih customer service in Pakistan. What if they had not done that? Will not we be claiming to provide the same? Bro!

Neither it was a personal attack. I just found our demand unjustified that''s why I commented. It is only my opinion as you have yours. I don''t want to prove something.\n\nNow reply to your questions are:\n\n1. Will a metallugy test prove that design failed? Does failure of just one pistol prove that design or entire production is flawed? Don''t you think we will need more such evidences? How can we declare on the basis of one pistol that design or entire production process is flawed?\n\n2. Sir, I am very much affraid of this situation. I do think that if the design or production process is flawed, this may happen again.\n\n3. If entire production is flawed how can we prove this on the basis of test performed on one piece only. Don''t you think, we will need larger sample size? And if production process is flawed, don''t you think every Caracal is carrying that flaw. Is it only this piece that carries code which when decoded will prove that entire production or design is flawed? Is scar on my face or broken pistol is the only source or evidence to prove that their entire production process is flawed.\n\n4. Regarding clarity on production from non / unbiased source. Sir, if we want to have clarity, we should get some Caracals tested from unbaised source. If the affected person wants clarity that is another story. Don''t you think it will only specific to one particular piece only. Will one piece prove that entire production is flawed or will it prove that specific piece is flawed? And do you think any testing lab being paid by Caracal will remain unbaised? If we all need calrity, let''s we pool our (all of us) resources (why you and me only) and get some pieces checked. And if Caracal has malafide intention, do you think they cannot influence results at any lab? Sir, we are nothing against a corporate and that too of richest nation. Or we believe in what they say.\n\n5. Answer is given above.\n\n6. Sir, I don''t know the reality. But Caracal Pakistan claims that they were not provided with contact details. Khans never denied that. Caracal Pakistan says that they replied, Khans say they did not get that. Evidence are required to give any verdict.

(504174, ' Salam All,\n@Leon - Very well stated post, thank you for posing the proper questions which I will now try to answer as best as possible.\n\n1.  This what I am about to answer in Question ONE is hypothetical:  lets say the slide was manufactured by powder metallurgy and its proven, powder metallurgy is not recommended to be used in high stress areas.  It can be but it gets more expensive for cost per part to do.  Once proven we would then look at the design of the slide, in this case the slide is actually pretty bare, the firing pin housing is locked into place via pins.  The thing to check next would be what areas should have been beefed up?  The area where the break occurred is generally the weakest point of a gun.  If upon testing it is found that not only powder metallurgy was used and then was heat treated beyond what was required... well I will have to say yes this manufacturing process is faulty AND is causing a design fault as a result.  One thing leading to another.  As for your comment on how can we say that by just one pistol the entire lot is flawed?  Good question and my answer is - I have never stated that the entire lot is flawed anywhere... but I will say this I am no longer interested in trying my hand at lady luck by firing this pistol.\n\n2.  Bro, as I stated to you before I am not interested in here and now whether Caracal does make changes or does not, I am not the Company owner, I don''t care.  What I DO care about are the friends and brothers I have made since being on PG forum and really DON''T EVER want to see them hurt.... this includes you too since you own a Caracal as well.  If you buy something and it breaks causing you physical harm don''t you want the item replaced and the medical bills paid?  Its very reasonable.  But at the same time its also very insulting to anyone if the company rather than quietly replacing the product and compensating the medical cost actually starts to allege things.\n\n3.  Again bro, I will be clear on this, I never stated that the entire lot in pakistan is flawed, however when the lots are shipped from any company regarding any product - its generally from the same group.... meaning the serial numbers are serial.  Again, if the manufacturing process shows weakness in the metal and certain areas of the slide is not left thicker to compensate for it then its called a manufacturing and design flaw.  One area of fault is leading to another. And I can tell you that one does not need a ton of Caracals to prove this.  About three to ten pieces from various serial numbers will suffice.\n\n4.  Bhai, don''t you want clarity regarding what you own?  Do you have brothers?  How would you like to see them bleeding on the floor from an accident like this?  I think you should want to know that what you own is dangerous that is a given... but dangerous to you the owner/operator as well?  That should not be a given.\n\nIt should not matter who said what and did what.  A product should have been replaced [U]immediately[/U] with apologies atleast and that was not done.  Rather now that its gone public here on this forum only so far that we are seeing some sort of communications.\n\nFinal Note:\nAs for Abbas, he IS a brother to me, a great person with a great personality - and he understands me well too.  We have gone at it before once or twice I believe on issues and no doubt we WILL have words on this issue as well I am sure.  But I know that both he and I WILL be still  PG brothers.', ''),

(504186, ' I admit to being a bit slow in grasping certain facts, but isn''t it in everybody''s best interest to get the gun tested via a neutral third party? I mean, that way neither the aggrieved party nor the gun manufacturer can shout foul and we''ll certainly avoid the second round of verbal finger-pointing if the test are conducted by one of the involved parties. I agree that we ought to have the slide tested first at the NCNDT and then send it off to Caracal for them to conduct their own tests; atleast that way we''ll have some reliable third-part corroboration of the results found by Caracal.\n\nI learned a long time ago that wisdom is always preceded by prudence,  and prudence dictates that, while we may pray for the best, we should  also prepare for the worst.\n\nI''m genuinely surprised as to the confusion surrounding this suggestion. As the end-consumers, we all should be highly concerned and should try to fully understand what really happened. Ideally we should test as many Caracals as possible to establish whether this is a one-off failure or whether this is the tip of a more widespread problem.\n\nThe best-case scenario I can see is that this was a one-in-a-million unfortunate incident, worst-case scenario is that we''ve stumbled upon a major design flaw that is detrimental to the gun''s structural integrity & operator safety. In either case, I personally believe that an independent third-party test would certainly go a long way in resolving this mess.\n\n[B]Moeen[/B], although I''m a total & complete layman when it comes to the technical aspects of firearms, I''ll be more than happy to help out in any way I can.

(504218, '577/500 Magnum Nitro Express This was originally a black-powder cartridge based on the 577 case necked to 50-caliber. It looks like, but is not the same as, the shorter 500 (500/577) No. 2 Express. It was introduced in the mid-1880s and enjoyed moderate popularity. Late loadings used smokeless powder and had a slightly higher velocity than the original black-powder type. It is obsolete and discontinued.\n\nAs an African cartridge, the 577/500 would be useful mostly for thin-skinned or non-dangerous varieties of game, except where conditions were very favorable to the hunter. It appears to have been more popular in India than Africa. Power is about the same as the old 50110 Winchester black-powder loads. It would be far more useful for North American hunting than any of the more powerful cartridges of the same caliber. It would be adequate for deer, bear, elk or moose at moderate ranges and would be fine for woods hunting. The old 45-70 military round is considered capable of killing any American game at short range, and it only develops 1570 fpe muzzle energy. The 577/500 is a good deal more potent than that, with muzzle velocity of 1880 fps and muzzle energy of 3420 fpe on a 440-grain bullet. Bullets for American 50-caliber rifles usually ranged from .509- to .518-inch in diameter. Some of these might be sized down to fit. Many of these old rifles were designed for black-powder and one should not use heavy smokeless loads.', ''),

(504232, '25 Stevens [FONT=&quot]Various dates can be found for the introduction of the 25 Stevens, with most authorities settling for around 1900. Reference in old books and catalogs would indicate an actual date of 1890, but this is not certain. In any event it was developed jointly by the J. Stevens Arms & Tool Co. and the Peters Cartridge Co. The Stevens “Crack Shot” #15 rifle came out in 1900, and one of its original calibers was the 25 Stevens. However, their “Favorite” rifle, manufactured from 1894 to 1935, may have been the first model available in this caliber. Both of these are under-lever single shots. Remington and Winchester also chambered rifles for the 25 Stevens. Original load was 67-grain bullet and 10 to 11 grains of black-powder. Semi-smokeless powder was also used, but smokeless was the only propellent when it was discontinued about 1942. Remington did some preliminary work on an improved, high-velocity loading just prior to WWII, but the project was dropped after the war. The improved round, called the 267 Remington Rimfire, was rumored to have a velocity of 1400 fps with the 67-grain bullet. [/FONT]\n\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n  [FONT=&quot]The 25 Stevens always had an excellent reputation as a killer of small game without ruining edible meat. Most complaints centered around the high cost of ammunition as compared to the 22 Long Rifle and the high trajectory which made sure hits beyond 60-70 yards difficult. For years, gun writers have been calling for a high-velocity version, but the ammunition companies have thus far not responded. With modern powder and a longer case, a velocity of 1600 to 1800 fps would be quite possible. However, rifles are no longer chambered for it, and ammunition isn’t manufactured in any form, so it appears to be a dead number. Many who used the Magnum Rimfire there isn’t much need for it. It had as inside-lubricated bullet and was available in solid and hollow-point type.[/FONT]\n\n  [FONT=&quot] [/FONT]', ''),

Some years a particular, trend or theme will rise to the forefront of the industry’s media coverage. In 2010, the market enjoyed a surge in new pocket-sized .380 semi-auto pistols. For 2011, .380 pocket pistols were trumped by a blitz of 9mm pocket rockets and we celebrated the<font color="#ce181e"><span style="-webkit-transition: 0.6s;">&nbsp;</span></font><font color="#ce181e"><span style="-webkit-transition: 0.6s;">birth of the 1911</span></font><a href="http://www.gunsandammo.com/tag/1911/" target="_blank"></a>. For 2012, a first look at the playing field revealed a variety of new guns to be released but not the headline-grabbing patterns of recent years. Upon closer examination, one particular caliber has plenty of new additions to get shooters out to the range: the .22 long rifle.</p><p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 24px; font-family: georgia; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); ">Why does the .22 have such a loyal following? Why does the selection of handguns and rifles chambered for this round continue to grow? When I started asking folks in the industry this question, they looked at me in a funny way. Why not ask the reason people prefer to eat on a daily basis or why they like to go shooting at all?</p><p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 24px; font-family: georgia; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); ">But this seemingly obvious question bears asking for good reasons. For all intents and purposes, the .22 long rifle should be obsolete. How many other black powder cartridges developed in 1887, with a family tree going back to 1845, have made the transition into the modern era? And of that handful of calibers, how many are stocked and sold by the thousands at local big-box and sporting goods stores? The rimfire primer system is obsolete, the round is not particularly powerful by today’s standards, and it’s actually a relatively complicated round to construct. So what’s all the excitement about?</p><p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 24px; font-family: georgia; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); ">Whatever weaknesses this cartridge may possess, they are almost universally overshadowed in light of the round’s positive characteristics. A few industry representatives from both sides of the .22 aisle, the gun makers and the ammunition manufacturers, shared with me their customers’ reasons for sending .22 rounds down range on a regular basis.</p><p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 24px; font-family: georgia; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); ">The single most quoted reason for the .22’s popularity? It’s cheap. Nothing speaks to the cost conscious shooter like the bottom line. Although all ammunition prices have gone up significantly in the last few years, you can still buy 500 rounds of bulk .22 cartridges for the same price as, or less than, a 50-round box of centerfire pistol or 20-round box of big-bore rifle rounds. This low per-round cost allows shooters to literally get more bangs for their buck, which translates to more actual trigger time.</p><p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 24px; font-family: georgia; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); ">A high customer demand allows manufacturers to keep the .22 ammunition supply plentiful and diverse. Few calibers offer as many bullet and power variations as this little rimfire. Another benefit of buying .22 is that many of these firearms cost less than their full-caliber counterparts.</p><p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 24px; font-family: georgia; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); ">If reducing the cost of both the ammunition and the gun is not enough incentive, then consider the reduction in noise and recoil. This is a big part of the fun factor of .22. Shooters can enjoy all of the satisfaction of hitting the target without the shoulder, wrist, or back pain that comes with long sessions at the shooting range with large-caliber guns. Reduced recoil also makes the .22 ideal for training new and young shooters. The .22 produces enough energy to make it good for small game hunting. The bullets are capable of dispatching the game without too much damage to the meat.</p><p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 24px; font-family: georgia; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); ">Whatever your reasons for choosing to own a .22, this gun and ammunition combination is far from becoming an endangered species. In fact, with recent ammunition shortages and continuing high prices still in the collective shooting consciousness, it’s likely that .22s are going to be as popular this year as ever, if not more so.<br><br><p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, ''Times New Roman'', Times, serif; line-height: 27px; text-align: left; ">This is the second post in my Trends in Self Defense series.

I have my eyes on Shadow in the Darkness and will get on visit home in April, In Sha Allah, but then again, departing from it will be more painful. \r\n\r\nAs far as the topic is concerned, my two cents are that "Home is where ur heart is", and in the body heart is in a cage, a fortress. Same goes for home, it should be a fortress. In urban survival situation and anarchy, ammo & bread are more precious than gold & books (I translated this line from Mukhtar Masood''s "Loh e Ayaam, the days of chaos and revolution in Iran" when another embassador offered all his books collections for bread and bullets).\r\n\r\nI assume a minimum deterrance cache of two weapons, a shotgun and a handgun. Scenario is urban anarchy, chaos, lawlessness and disaster, where you have to defend yourself and your family. In addition to ammo, storage of food, water and first-aid/medicine is also crucial, minimum for 2 weeks, revolving to keep fresh.  \r\n\r\nFor a handgun as many bullets as you can carry in a gun and with gun (holster or pouch, filled magazines in case of pistol) that you can shoot with as much accuracy as you can muster when mustering’s required, an average 45 for 9mm 15 round capacity 3 magazines, or 21 for .45 or .30 cal. Similiar quantity should be stored in case streets are unsafe to go to stores. Another 50 cartridges for shotgun are minimum, which can be used as backup and deterrance to avoid any upcoming possible confrontations.', ''),

However with my very limited experience with the said authority, I can safely assume that anything is possible. \n\n-CARACAL floated the idea of establishing customer services, and did not deliver on that idea - till yet. The delays can be due to numerous factor so lets not rush and rule it out. Besides, how many German, Austrian, Turkish or Chinese or whatever manufacturers have even indicated on their intention to open customer service centers in Pakistan? So lets be patient & appreciate their stance and lets not grill them over the delay.\n\nAgain, by the grace of the ALMIGHTY the op did not suffer a more serious or life threatening injury and I believe is on the road to recovery.

Thousands of pieces have been sold worldwide and nothing has been reported. The C does not have the Nato D14 certification like the F and frankly from personal experience of the 1100 round test I did, it''s a pretty tough gun to break. The issue lies with the Caracal C which might be one of three things. A design flaw, a metallurgy flaw or a specific piece flaw. I have no idea if the boys are going ahead with the testing or not but regardless if I owned a Caracal C I would wait for the company to inspect the piece in question and then tell us if it was just one gun or the entire lot of C''s sold here that have a problem. To be on the safe side I would put away the Caracal C till we hear more from the company.\n\nIf a problem is found with the gun by the company I would not ask for a slide replacement, I would instead request/insist on [B]nothing less then a complete recall of *ALL* Caracal C''s from the Pakistani market[/B] and they be replaced with their upcoming next generation models.', ''),

(504687, ' My dear brother Baderjanjua\nFirst of all congratulations on your purchase. Your acquisition is truly a fine weapon. \nI would however, give you a heads-up on the following issues, since you mentioned that you would be keeping the weapon as a SD weapon in a vehicle:\n\n1- The .357 magnum round from a snub nose causes a HUGE muzzle flash. The ported model directs a big portion of that flash upwards. Hence if you are shooting it from a position where the ports would face you (very easy to do in a vehicle when pointing the weapon slightly upwards from the seat position to say the window), you MIGHT be exposing yourself  to burns yourself. If you happen to shoot from the driver side towards the passenger window, you might be risking burning the passenger , even if the muzzle if far clear of the passenger. \n2- The .357 magnum from a snub nose produces a very loud report. I have had the unfortunate experience of shooting the same without hearing protection in the OPEN and my ears were ringing for a considerable time. I can only assume that shooting the same in an enclosed place (such as indoors or within a vehicle) could cause serious damage to the hearing.\n \nThe above are my personal opinions in view of my experience with this weapon. I would not want a fellow pakgunner to be in any harms way.\nI would recommend that you do your own research on this.\n\nBest regards', ''),
(504689, ' [QUOTE=Moeen;342727]Salam All,\nWell that depends on the Company itself as to what it wants to do... we are supposed to - lolz - HOPE.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear bro have a little faith, I completely understand where you''re coming from. I know the [B]only [/B]reason for your passionate posts and offering to go out of your way and get the weapon tested at your own expense and time is to benefit the gun community of Pakistan. I also know more than anyone on this forum that you have absolutely no personal stake in this and you only bought a Caracal cause I made you curious enough to try one ;)\n \nThe way I look at it is, if the lot is indeed faulty why would the company being a responsible multimillion dollar international concern suggest something to it''s customers which can potentially maim/kill them ? Let''s say they ignore the couple thousand of Caracal C''s floating around in the Pakistani market. One fine day a couple of weeks later another piece blows up, then another, what then ? It''s going to be posted here on PakGuns and from here it''s going to migrate to other international forums all over the world. In less than 72 hours on our forum alone the thread had more than 10,000 views! In user terms that means about 2000 people who have read this thread from all over the world. Do you not think those 2000 will repeat what is happening in this thread to 10 others and those to others. In short another one or two incidents with the batch in Pakistan and the bad press will cost Caracal worldwide 10 times more to fix then the profits they have made from Pakistan. Profits aside, these guys are more concerned with reputation and leaving dangerous guns in the market would be suicide for a new firearms company trying to make a name for itself.\n\nI have had limited dealing with the Caracal guys but in the times that I have met them I have found them to be caring, forthcoming and proactive specially where the gun community of Pakistan is concerned.\n\nAnd I could not agree more when you say "United we stand, Divided we fall". Let me be the first to stand behind you to represent the interests of the Gun Community of Pakistan.', ''),

(504737, ' 22LR - In The Sport of Shooting & Hunting Safety Comes First\n \nThere is chatter under another thread relating to destruction of a handgun and injury to the shooter. It is not clear if the firearm was faulty or if the ammunition had powder charge that was over and above the limit set by the powder manufacturer.\n \nEarlier (#491) I mentioned that Winchester had recalled some batches of Wildcat 22 (symbol WW22LR) and Xpert 22 (symbol XPERT 22) ammunition that had double power charge. A double powder charged cartridge may serve the purpose of proof testing a firearm in controlled environment, but had no place in the hunting and shooting sport arena. Our friend SAAMI, (Sporting Arms & Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute) has set chamber pressure limit of 24,000 pounds per square inch for the 22LR cartridge. Any 22LR cartridge that delivers pressure over this limit is considered not safe.\n \nI have personally conducted a study of 22LR cartridges to see amount of variations in overall cartridge weight and weight of the components by taking them apart - bullets, powder charges and primed cartridges - that were void of bullets and powder charges. In the study I discovered powder overcharge of up to 21%. These over-charged cartridges no doubt delivered the so-called “flyers” shots and exceeded the SAAMI limits. Center fire cartridge players can choose the component and “cook” their own. I have done this kind of exercise thousands of times with 9mm and .308 Winchester cartridges and held the powder charge to within 0.1 grain (15.43 grains = 1 gram) of the limit set by the powder manufacture. No ammunition manufacture that I know of has claimed such tight powder charge limits. In the 22LR community we can not "cook" our own ammunituion.\n \nIn the past 60 years I have come across one instance where a 22LR gun-ammo combination delivered damaging results. In the 1960s I was in the market for a 22LR handgun. I came across a Harrington & Richardson 22LR revolver. The model number at this time escapes me. This revolver was like the Webly revolvers, top-break style. When I examined the barrel, I discovered a bulge. A asked the owner about it. He said that he was using a mix of ammunition of various manufacturers. He did not realize that one the shots he fired did not sound like the others. It was the culprit that lodged the bullet in the barrel. When the next cartridge was fired, the blockage caused the damage to the firearm. That incidence resulted in powder burns and damage to the handgun.\n \nWhere I live, public gun ranges have a strict rule. You must wear eye and ear protection. This is sound advise regardless of the venue. Shopping for ammunition solely on price alone is not advisable. Even well respected ammo manufacturer like Winchester has encountered manufacturing problems as I cited above. Why seek grief with ammunition that lacks reputation or long-term history?', ''),

We need to change .22lr round to un-rimmed case before we could find something .22lr sooo reliable cycling semi auto.[/QUOTE]\n\nDenovo has hit the nail on the head in this paragraph.22LR cartridge and all guns are fun to shoot as far as plinking goes. Due to primer in the rim it will be always a questionable round for reliability. Quality improvements in past decades made this round very affordable and still plenty available in the markets all around the world. Here is my take. \n\nWhenever my kids are home we take a bulk box (over 550) to the range and just shoot. Do I get duds, oh yeah. Do I discard them or throw them? Hell no. I rotate them and shoot them either on 2nd or 3rd try. I do that since I got plenty of time.\n \nDoes this scenario qualifies 22LR to be my self defense cartridge. Absolutely NOT.Guys, I got only one life, and I want to protect it with everything best available for me. 22LR does not fall in best for me. Now, if this is all I got, then it is something better than nothing. And trust me, don''t underestimate this little bullet, it can be lethal if placed correctly. Seen many people getting hurt thinking that it is not.\n\nIf you want a potent and small cartridge, my suggestion would be to go for 9X18 Mak, I carry it everyday and feels like part of my body. Pretty powerful bullet in small cartridge and does the job forcefully. \n\nPicture of this little gun on my collection page.

Could you please quote where did you get these TESTS from.[/QUOTE]\nRespected Sir, following is an excerpt from wikipedia:\n"Before being put into production the Caracal pistol was evaluated through independent tests. These tests were carried out by the Federal German Armed Forces Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in Meppen, Germany[5] which included metallurgic and composite analysis, functional fitness-for-purpose and quality evaluation, endurance firing, environmental exposure, safety and accuracy tests. A certificate was issued by the Bundeswehr Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in May 2006 after the pistol successfully complied with the NATO D14 standard, the German Federal Police Standard and the German Federal Armed Forces Technical Purchasing requirements. These tests are the most stringent test protocols ever devised for a service firearm".\n\nAnd Wilhelm Bubits along with Friedrich Aigner designed Steyr M and S series pistols (source wikipedia).\n\nThe certificate can be seen on Caracal.ae website [url]http://www.caracal.ae/certificates.php[/url]', ''),

Due to primer in the rim it will be always a questionable round for reliability. Quality improvements in past decades made this round very affordable and still plenty available in the markets all around the world. Here is my take. \n\nWhenever my kids are home we take a bulk box (over 550) to the range and just shoot. Do I get duds, oh yeah. Do I discard them or throw them? Hell no. I rotate them and shoot them either on 2nd or 3rd try. I do that since I got plenty of time.\n \nDoes this scenario qualifies 22LR to be my self defense cartridge. Absolutely NOT.Guys, I got only one life, and I want to protect it with everything best available for me. 22LR does not fall in best for me. Now, if this is all I got, then it is something better than nothing. And trust me, don''t underestimate this little bullet, it can be lethal if placed correctly. Seen many people getting hurt thinking that it is not.\n\nIf you want a potent and small cartridge, my suggestion would be to go for 9X18 Mak, I carry it everyday and feels like part of my body. Pretty powerful bullet in small cartridge and does the job forcefully. \n\nPicture of this little gun on my collection page.

(504851, ' @cyklops.\n\nMy pennies worth, as I have the experience of both sides of the water.\n\n1. Although you hold a British passport but because you  are Pakistani which is why you have the NICOP, British govt will NOT  protect you in any way and it is clearly mentioned that dual nationality  holders are not protected by GB when on their own motherland. But they will visit you if you are in jail. This is the official statement.\n\nSo  keeping the above in mind you need to forget about your thoughts of how  PK police or anyone else might treat a British citizen.\n\n2. There are plenty of Gun clubs in UK, you should visit couple of them and get yourself familiar with the real mcoy. \nIf  you have a license and a gun in UK then you can take your own gun to  the club otherwise club will happily let you use their own gun. You will  of course be expected to cover the fee and ammo.\nIt is one thing  using a CO2 in your garden and completely another thing using a real  article on your attacker as you put it. So going to a club in UK will  give you some idea of what to expect as they do run different types of  combat scene etc depending on the clubs. \n\n3. During your visit  your best bet is to have a trusting driver and one of the house servant  with you when you plan to visit the unknowns. Having a gun on you or  guards can not do anything if other party has plenty of these too. If  anything it will make things worse and infuse the situation.\nBe  Pakistani, think like one and behave like one. If you stand out from the  crowd not by appearance but by your actions too i.e. thinking that you  are British then you are indeed asking for trouble.\n\nBottom line  is that there is no denying the fact that security situation is  extremely poor in PK, but saying that life goes on so just be on your  guards and do not mingle with people you don''t know. \nProblem with  you (western born kids, as my own nieces and nephews) is that you are  very trusting because of the safe environment you live in.

Where I am, there are many web forums just for building guns.  We can do this because nobody in the government considered you could do such a thing without a factory, and there are so few of us it''s not worth the money and time to write laws regulating our activities.  So we don''t have a law that permits us to build firearms.  Instead, we have a bulletin from the appropriate agency, who apparently got tired of answering enquiries on the subject.  It boils down to "no, we don''t regulate individuals, please go away."\r\n\r\n I''d seen build threads from other countries, but nothing from Pakistan.

When I visit a shop in Pak, Forget about me getting any protocol I never even mention or give them the slightest hint that I am from abroad otherwise I know the prices quotes will change from Rupees into Pound sterling, or in other words they will try to charge you sky high prices and often it does happen.

The slide broke off around the locking lugs and the rear part of the seperated slide hit the shooter(s) causing serious  injuries to the face. \nWhile fixing the metallurgy issue, Beretta also incorporated a design change which prevented the separated slide from flying off the frame rearwards and prevented it from hitting the shooter.', ''),

My location is abroad but Trust me buddy I think I know what I am talking about and also I am in regular contact with many friends in this game including some well reputable dealers who''s names I am not even going to mention. Often when Me and my friends decide to buy a new toy It is me who ring from here (withheld number or private call) not mentioning I am calling from abroad, find out about the availability then agree a price over the phone and tell the shop keeper to put one to a side as I&#8217;m busy but will be sending somebody over, then send somebody to pick it up. The dealers always thinking I rang from my home town in Pak. When I visit a shop in Pak, Forget about me getting any protocol I never even mention or give them the slightest hint that I am from abroad otherwise I know the prices quotes will change from Rupees into Pound sterling, or in other words they will try to charge you sky high prices and often it does happen. Long Story Short, if you have been going into the gun shops thousands of times (going 1 thousand times alone means missing a single day for over two and a half years) then sorry to say but you have been wasting your time by walking into the wrong no actually rather sensible gun shops I should say.

People store ammo the wrong way\n5. Dealers store ammo the wrong way & Moisture builds up.\n6. Some manufactures make cheap quality ammo with a small shelf life.\n\n\nPeople with .22lr weapon normally choose a good quality ammo whether it''s for hunting or target practicing. Some people (i call them cheap dumb ass) who buy a .22lr weapon and choose the cheapest ammo they can find to shoot & then they either blame the caliber or the weapon.\n\nFirst of all if you look at other calibers which normally used for SDC. They are .22,10,30,32,38,9mm,40,44,45. Out of these calibers the .22lr is the cheapest caliber around the world. Now even after selecting the cheapest caliber, these people then move on to the cheapest manufactures when it comes to buying ammo. WTF? \n\nMost of the .22lr ammo you find at the dealers carry between 3 to 5 years old storing the ammo wrong way[FONT=verdana, geneva, lucida, lucida grande, arial, helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=2][COLOR=#000000] & [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]Moisture gets to them. Check your local dealer when your buying your next ammo. check the manufactures date & shipped date. You see what i''m talking about. If you don''t find one well than you know what i''m talking about. Dealers buy ammo at a cheap price specially if the ammo is really old or expired. Some of the boxes that i bought 20 years ago & i have fired few of the ammo from those boxes worked 100%. Some of us buy weapons just to show off, it doesn''t work like that. Weapons care & safety handling only works with passion. If you don''t have the passion for guns you rather protect your self with a broom stick than a gun. \n\nOver the years i have used .22lr & sen it evolved more than any other caliber in my life & i found it to be the best caliber for my self & family. They are good with short & long distance as well and i don''t have to switch back & forth with other calibers depending on my situation. I''m arguing regarding the false reputation & bad marketing of the .22lr. No matter how small, big Or strong you are, you will always response to the recoil from the 30,32,38,9mm,40,44 & 45. But not with .22lr which gives everyone a advantage to shoot on target.', ''),

(505190, ' I think friends are over reacting a bit. One gun malfunctioned, that does not mean every single product the company ever manufactured comes under suspicion. Accidents happen and there are lemon''s in every batches.\n \nThat said, I was very confident of the Caracal F when conducting the test. Not only did I shoot 1100+ rounds though it, I put it though what is hell on earth for any handgun and continued to shoot it past that. If I had doubts I would not risk getting my head busted based on luck. Infact if asked I would not mind shooting 2000 more though the same gun to prove my point. \n\nGlocks, Styers, Sig''s, CZ''s have decades of research and development behind their products. Each of their products is Generation 3 or 4 atleast. Caracal is Gen 1 and for a Gen 1 product in my opinion it''s doing a marvelous job. Might I also mention the affordability factor. Glock, Sig''s and Styers are retailing upwards of 325,000 last I heard. As for CZ they are the best deal in Pakistan right now and for me the best handgun ever made. The day Skeeter60 and I learned of the CZ''s in the local market we were like giddy school kids in a candy shop buying away one of this and two of that :D\n\nI have to say some of the things that I have been reading in this thread left me scratching my head. If my 19 busted would I expect a complete recall of all Glocks ever made or put Glock as a brand under suspicion ? If a Para Ordinance which is an expensive firearm by Pakistani standards (4 times the price of a Caracal) and a established name in the international firearms industry can malfunction and that too a brand new unfired piece, should we then make another thread about taking Para Ordinance to court and start demanding an immediate recall of all Para Ordinance''s ever made ? Sounds silly doesn''t it ?\n\nMy recommendation is simple, to be on the safe side just put away your Caracal C''s for a while till the company analyses the problem and suggests a course of action. As for the Caracal F, I would continue to shoot mine at every opportunity I get.', ''),

In the 80''s Beretta M9 slides experienced several slide separations similar to what this Caracal C slide did. The fault was arguably put on metallurgy. The slide broke off around the locking lugs and the rear part of the seperated slide hit the shooter(s) causing serious  injuries to the face. \r\nWhile fixing the metallurgy issue, Beretta also incorporated a design change which prevented the separated slide from flying off the frame rearwards and prevented it from hitting the shooter.[/QUOTE] Thank you for valuable information, I am clear now.', ''),

People store ammo the wrong way\n5. Dealers store ammo the wrong way & Moisture builds up.\n6. Some manufactures make cheap quality ammo with a small shelf life.\n\n\nPeople with .22lr weapon normally choose a good quality ammo whether it''s for hunting or target practicing. Some people (i call them cheap dumb ass) who buy a .22lr weapon and choose the cheapest ammo they can find to shoot & then they either blame the caliber or the weapon.\n\nFirst of all if you look at other calibers which normally used for SDC. They are .22,10,30,32,38,9mm,40,44,45. Out of these calibers the .22lr is the cheapest caliber around the world. Now even after selecting the cheapest caliber, these people then move on to the cheapest manufactures when it comes to buying ammo.

Check your local dealer when your buying your next ammo. check the manufactures date & shipped date. You see what i''m talking about.

Some of the boxes that i bought 20 years ago & i have fired few of the ammo from those boxes worked 100%. Some of us buy weapons just to show off, it doesn''t work like that. Weapons care & safety handling only works with passion. If you don''t have the passion for guns you rather protect your self with a broom stick than a gun. \n\nOver the years i have used .22lr & sen it evolved more than any other caliber in my life & i found it to be the best caliber for my self & family. They are good with short & long distance as well and i don''t have to switch back & forth with other calibers depending on my situation. I''m arguing regarding the false reputation & bad marketing of the .22lr. No matter how small, big Or strong you are, you will always response to the recoil from the 30,32,38,9mm,40,44 & 45. But not with .22lr which gives everyone a advantage to shoot on target.[/QUOTE]\n\nI didnt know Winchester was cheap ammo, thats all ive ever used, also to note that in our market 22lr is hardly found in any cheap or substandard brands,,,,,,,,22LR related problems are reported all over the world in almost every forum, now u cant say they all are cheap dumb a## ( or maybe u might )... there is no doubt it is one of the most controvercial calibres', ''),

If you want to run it in a competition like IDPA having a shorter barrel makes it much easier to manoeuvre and manipulate the rifle around. Also in my own personal experience even a 7.5 inched AR-15 can shoot out to 300 yards without a magnified optic very accurately. There is not much advantaged gained when you''re moving from 16 to 18inches of barrel. If you move to 20 then yes there is more advantage gained. A 14.5 inched AR is just as accurate as an 18inch AR within the 300 yard range and rarely are you going to take it past that range. The .223 round is built for CQB scenarios within a range of 400 yards, although an 18 inch barrel is more accurate than its shorter counterparts but only slightly and it makes the rifle heavy and hard to manipulate in competition.

I was not pointing my comment to anybody here specifically. \n\nHere is your Proof:\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]This invention relates to ammunition, particularly to primers, and more particularly to the use of an inorganic reactive multilayer (RML) as the primary chemical initiator in order to control the usable life-time of cartridges and detonators for explosives.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Cartridge primers, are the initial explosive train component in ammunition consisting of a cartridge case, propellant, and projectile. Cartridge primers generally consist of a thin metal cup, a metal anvil, and an explosive protected by foil and sealed with lacquer. The explosive or primary initiator is a shock-sensitive material such as fulminate of mercury, potassium chlorate, or lead styphnate. Lead styphnate has been used as the primary initiator in primers for the past fifty years. These cartridge primers have a virtually unlimited shelf-life. It is not surprising that the performance and reliability of ammunition that has been stored properly for more than fifty years is indistinguishable from new ammunition. Hence, ammunition manufactured with primers using modern chemical initiators can be expected to remain functional indefinitely. This quality is essential to the stockpiling of ammunition required by the military. However, this quality also creates a potentially dangerous situation because it allows anyone to stockpile large quantities of ammunition without any anticipated legitimate use. Subversive individuals and groups are therefore able to "out-gun" law enforcement personnel attempting to execute lawful search and arrest warrants because of the nearly endless amount of ammunition that can be expended from a fortified position in an armed conflict.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Recently, there have been efforts to impose increasingly stricter gun-control measures by state and federal legislatures, as well as a call for "safer bullets" by the U.S. Surgeon General, in order to reduce the occurrence of violent crime. The effectiveness of new gun control legislation is the subject of much debate due to loop-holes in the laws and, perhaps, more importantly, the number of firearms already owned by the general public (estimated to be as high as 200 million firearms nationwide). There is a need for alternate methods of reducing the occurrence of gun related violence, such as controlling the availability of ammunition. One method of controlling the availability of ammunition that has been suggested is to limit its usable service-life. It is generally accepted that limiting the shelf-life of the primer is the most efficient method of controlling the usable service life of ammunition, because the complexity of the primer makes it the most difficult cartridge component to duplicate or replace.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]While prior efforts have been contemplated to reduce the long shelf-life problem, no solution has yet been found. For example, one of the largest suppliers of primers to the ammunition reloader, CCI, has stated, "On the shelf life issue, our chemists have decades of experience in designing chemical initiators, and they know of no way to `kill` a primer after two years that won''t kill it tomorrow. The chemical technology to limit shelf life simply does not exist. Primer shelf life is measured in decades (see Shooting Times/September 1994, "Precision Reloading" by Rick Jamison, pp. 28-32 and 35).[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The present invention fills the above-mentioned needs by providing a method of controlling the availability of ammunition by limiting the functional shelf-life of the primer, and thus offers an alternate and simple method of reducing the occurrence of firearms-related violence.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

Basically, the present invention comprises a primer that utilizes a primary initiator or explosive that can be designed to become inactive in a predetermined period of time. The primary initiator or explosive is a synthetic inorganic material consisting of many layers of reactive elements, such as titanium-boron. The detonation or ignition sensitivity of these reactive multilayer materials is attributed to the interfacial energy stored in the metastable structure. The ignition sensitivity of the reactive multilayer degrades with time because interdiffusion of atoms reduces the excess energy stored at the layer interfaces. Thus, the usable life-time of the primer can be determined by the proper selection of the reacting elements and the design of the multilayer structure.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Limiting the shelf-life of a cartridge primer as described in this invention is accomplished by using a new type of primary initiator. The shock-sensitive chemical initiator used in the limited-life cartridge-primers is an inorganic reactive multilayer (RML). An RML is a synthetic material with a modulated structure consisting of many thin layers of reactive elements such as boron and titanium. The combustion properties of a reactive multilayer such as energy and reactivity are primarily determined by the selection of reacting elements. The shock-sensitivity of an RML is a result of the metastable interface structure between reacting layers and the thickness of the layers. Reacting multilayers are generally synthesized by a vacuum coating process such as sputtering; consequently, these properties can be controlled by modifying its modulated structure.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Unlike the explosives currently used as the chemical initiator in primers, the shock-sensitive reactivity of a RML changes with time because interdiffusion of atoms reduces the excess energy stored at the metastable interfaces. The rate of this process is unique for a particular combination of elements, and the net result is that atoms tend to migrate from a region of high concentration to a region of lower concentration. The change in the rate of atomic diffusion with temperature is known to follow an Arrhenius relationship, whereby the diffusion rate is proportional to the exponential of temperature. The time period when a RML will function as a shock-sensitive explosive can be determined and controlled by selecting a combination of elements with appropriate diffusion characteristics. The primary initiators currently used in commercial cartridge primers have metastable molecular structures that do not change by a simple atomic diffusion process; consequently, they do not exhibit this predictable change in reactivity.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]This invention includes two basic designs for limited-life cartridge primers that use reactive multilayers as the primary chemical initiator. The first design simply replaces the chemical initiator with a comparable amount of RML in the standard Boxer primer. The second design is a modified version of the Boxer primer that uses a small amount of RML to ignite a standard chemical initiator. The later design would minimize both increases in manufacturing costs related to materials and changes in primer performance.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]This invention also includes a design for a new primer using a RML that can be initiated electrically with the spark from a nine volt battery.[/FONT][/COLOR]', '');

It involves replacing the shock-sensitive organic explosive used in cartridge primers, for example, with an inorganic reactive multilayer (RML) that functions as an explosive for a limited period of time. RML''s are modulated structures consisting of very thin (1 to 1000 nm) alternating layers of two or more reactive elements and/or inorganic compounds, such as titanium-boron (Ti--B), titanium-silicon (Ti--Si), nickel-silicon (Ni--Si), beryllium-carbon (Be--C), and aluminum-platinum (Al--Pt); or three material alternating layers of reactive elements and an inorganic compound, such as titanium-carbon-copper oxide (Ti-C-CuO), aluminum-carbon-copper oxide (Al-C-CuO), and beryllium-carbon-copper oxide (Be-C-CuO). Individual layer thicknesses of RML designs can vary from less than one nanometer (nm) to more than several micrometers (&#956;m). RML''s are generally prepared by vacuum deposition processes. The energy stored in the large number of metastable layer interfaces (100s to 10,000) is responsible for their unusual sensitivity to reaction.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]RML''s have energy densities comparable to organo-metallic initiator explosives, such as lead styphnate, and RML''s are essentially unaffected by moisture or solvents. However, time-dependent interdiffusion of the elements occurring at the layer interfaces in the RML reduces stored energy and reactivity. The interdiffusion process is a function of time at temperature and is a characteristic of the material composition of the multilayer. Consequently, the reacting elements and inorganic compounds and the individual layer thicknesses can be designed to determine the time at ambient conditions that a RML will function as an initiator-type explosive. The reaction products of RML''s are sub-micron grains of non-corrosive inorganic compounds that would have no harmful effects on firearms or cartridge cases. Unlike most commercial primers that contain lead compounds, primers utilizing RML''s would not present a hazard to the environment.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The storage temperature can have a significant effect on the expected performance life-time of a life-limited cartridge primer (LLCP) due to the temperature dependent interdiffusion of the reacting elements in the RML. Previous studies performed using various different multilayer combinations have determined that interlayer growth obeys a square-root time-dependence, suggesting that interlayer growth is diffusion-limited. It is this property of multilayers that leads to, over a period of time at temperature, an intermixed structure which is eventually no longer capable of reacting explosively. The amount of intermixing within the RML, after a given storage time, can be related to a quantity known as the interdiffusion coefficient. Empirically it is found that the interdiffusion coefficient is a function of temperature and a quantity known as the activation energy of interdiffusion. Previous studies on RML''s have reported activation energies of from 0.3 to 3.0 eV, suggesting large variations in thermal stability at ambient temperatures depending upon the magnitude of the activation energy. Assuming that the LLCP''s would be subjected to storage temperature extremes of 0° to 50° C., and assuming also that the corresponding maximum and minimum shelf-life extremes are selected as 5 years and 6 months, respectively, then the requisite RML activation energy would be within the range of experimentally reported values and, hence, achievable using existing material combinations.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The shelf-life of a LLCP could be extended indefinitely by storing them at temperatures significantly below ambient, where interdiffusion of the elements is very slow. However, this method of extending the functional life-time of the LLCP is prevented in this invention by incorporating a material in the multilayer structure that exhibits at least one of the following characteristics: 1) a destructive phase change at low temperatures, such as displayed with pure tin; 2) a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that differs significantly from the primer cup and/or RML; or 3) internal or residual stress rendering the structure mechanically unstable with respect to changes in temperature. For example, pure tin when cooled to 13.2° C., transforms from the beta phase with a diamond-cubic crystal structure to the alpha phase with a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure. In the past, this transformation was referred to as "Tin-Pest" because the silver-metallic beta-Sn would crumble into a gray dust. Adding a pure tin layer to the base of the RML or incorporating a layer of pure tin in the RML structure will cause the RML to disintegrate (by the first-named characteristic) at temperatures below the phase transformation temperature. Consequently, a LLCP containing a RML with a pure tin layer would not function at ambient temperatures if it had been previously stored at temperatures below the transformation temperature, or adding a layer with a CTE that differs significantly from the primer cup and/or RML will cause the layer to delaminate from the primer cup and/or RML at temperatures significantly below ambient. Similarly, an additional layer with high residual stresses would also be subject to mechanical failure (de-lamination) at temperatures significantly below ambient.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Limited-life cartridge primers (LLCP''s) using RML''s of this invention would allow the manufacture of ammunition that would remain functional for a limited, predetermined period of time. This would enable the government to restrict the ability civilians would have to stockpile large quantities of ammunition, thereby impeding the ability of subversives to engage in protracted armed conflict with law enforcement. This would also reduce occurrences of accidental shootings by children encountering long-since forgotten, loaded firearms. The use of LLCP''s would have only minimal effects on citizens involved in law-abiding activities such as target shooting and hunting. Ammunition would have to be purchased at more frequent intervals (e.g., annually) for legitimate planned or anticipated uses. This would lead to increased commercial profits (as well as increased potential tax revenues) generated from the additional sales required to replace non-functional ammunition.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The limited-life primer of this invention could improve the long-term safety of commercial explosives other than ammunition primers, such as detonators and blasting caps, by restricting their functional lifetime. Thus, accidents caused, for example, by children playing with detonators or blasting caps discovered many years later in prior blasting areas, could be reduced or eliminated entirely.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The limited-life cartridge primers, utilizing RML''s as the explosive material can be fabricated, for example, by three (3) methods that are compatible with existing primer manufacturing technology. In one method, the appropriate RML can be directly deposited in the cup portion of the primer assembly by vacuum coating techniques (i.e., sputtering, evaporation), described in detail hereinafter. In another method, the RML can be fabricated in a separate process, converted into a powder, and used in place of the standard organic initiator explosive, as set forth below. In this method the RML material can be made by processes other than atomic deposition such as cold-rolling elemental ribbons into a multilayer structure. In another method small pre-formed shapes can be cut from the RML foils or RML films deposited on thin aluminum foil, for example, and placed directly into the primer cups, with details set forth below. Experiments utilizing this latter method have shown that detonation of the RML causes the aluminum foil to combust thereby increasing the energy released in the explosion.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]As utilized herein, the term foil is defined as free-standing substrate or member, while the term film is defined as a thin coating (single or multiple layer) deposited on a foil or substrate. The film (single layer or multilayer) may in some instances be removed from the foil or substrate after deposition and thus be free-standing.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]An embodiment of a prior art Boxer type cartridge primer is illustrated in FIG. 1A, and basically comprises a cup 1 within which is located an explosive mixture 2, a foil or paper 3, and an anvil 4. The primer of FIG. 1A is modified as shown in FIG. 1B by replacing the explosive mixture 2 with an inorganic reactive multilayer (RML) 5, as seen in FIGS. 2 and 3A (with or without the foil 3 of FIG. 1A); and/or with powder 6 from an inorganic reactive multilayer, and which may or may not utilize the foil 3. A thin (0.5 to 2.0 &#956;m) layer 7 of pure tin, for example, is position in cup 1, but can be added to the RML 5.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Prior to a detailed description of the three element multilayer (FIG. 2) and the two element multilayer (FIGS. 3A and 3B), there is a basic difference these two types of RML''s. The three (3) element RML is an explosive which produces a working fluid or expanding gas (i.e., CO) and high temperature, and such is described and claimed in copending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/120,407, filed Sep. 13, 1993, entitled "Nano-Engineered Explosives", and assigned to the same assignee. The two (2) element RML produces high temperature, but no expanding gas. Both types of RML''s can effectively ignite a cartridge powder charge, as shown in the FIGS. 6 and 7 embodiment. A two element RML is simpler and less expensive to fabricate. Both the three element and two element RML''s can be fabricated utilizing the apparatus of FIG. 4, but with different operational sequences. The multilayers of FIGS. 2 and 3A-3B may include material, such as pure tin, that has a destructive phase change at low temperatures. It may be possible to utilize other material than tin, which has a destructive phase change at low temperatures, such as by the addition of small amounts (less than 1 atom percent) of another material such as antimony. However, such has not been experimentally verified and may have adverse effects. Tin is the only thus far verified material.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]FIG. 2 is an enlarged partial view of an embodiment of a three material reactive multilayer (RML) structure using a sequence of Ti--C--CuO layers, that will detonate and combust at high velocities generating a working fluid, such as carbon monoxide (CO), and high temperatures. This embodiment comprises a multilayer structure 5 of repeated submicron layers of titanium (Ti) and copper oxide (CuO), indicated at 8 and 9, with a submicron layer 10 of carbon (C) between each of the Ti layers 8 and CuO layers 9 to prevent unwanted passivation reactions. Each of the layers (8-10) having a thickness, for example, between 10 angstroms and one micrometer (10,000 Å). The number of layers in the structure 5 may vary from about 100 to 10,000, depending on the specific application. At least one layer 11 of tin may be added to the RLM 5 of FIG. 2. The tin is preferably pure tin with the layer thickness of 5000 Å. The layer 11 of tin may be located elsewhere in the multilayer or more than one layer of tin may be utilized.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The reaction of metals (i.e. Al, Ti, Be . . . ) with inorganic oxides (i.e. CuO, Fe[/FONT][/COLOR][SUB]2[/SUB][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial] O[/FONT][/COLOR][SUB]3[/SUB][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial] to produce Al[/FONT][/COLOR][SUB]2[/SUB][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial] O[/FONT][/COLOR][SUB]3[/SUB][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial] and Fe is referred to as a Thermite reaction.

Magnetron sputtering is a momentum transfer process that causes atoms to be ejected from the surface of a cathode or target material by bombardment of inert gas ions accelerated from a low pressure glow discharge. Magnetron sputtering is known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 5,203,977 issued Apr. 20, 1993 to D. M. Makowiecki et al and U.S. Pat. No. 5,333,726 issued Aug. 2, 1994 to D. M. Makowiecki et al, and assigned to the same assignee. Thus a detailed description herein of a magnetron sputtering source and its operation is not deemed necessary.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The individual magnetron sources may be located and controlled such that the substrate is continuously rotated from one source to another using four (4) sources (i.e. Ti, C, CuO, C), or a three (3) magnetron assembly source may be used, and the substrate is rotated back and forth so as to provide sequential layers of Ti, C, CuO, Cu, Ti, C, etc.), as seen with respect to FIG. 4. A two magnetron source sputtering assembly is adequate for fabricating the two element RMLs.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Referring now to FIG. 4, a three source magnetron sputtering assembly is schematically illustrated, and which comprises a chamber 20 in which is located a rotating copper substrate table 21 provided with a substrate water cooling mechanism 22 having coolant inlet and outlets 23 and 24. Located and fixedly mounted above the rotating table 21 are three DC magnetrons 25, 26, and 27, equally spaced at 120° C., and being electrically negative, as indicated at 28. Each of the magnetrons 25, 26, and 27 is provided with water cooling inlets 29 and outlets 30. Located between each of the magnetrons 25-27 and the rotating table 21 is a cross contamination shield 31. Rotating table 21 is provided with an opening 32 in which is located a substrate 33 on which the thin films of reactive metal, carbon and oxide are deposited as the table 21 is rotated in opposite directions over the substrate 33 as indicated by the dash line and double arrow 34. The chamber 20 may include means, not shown, for providing a desired atmosphere for the sputtering operation, the type of atmosphere depending on the materials being sputtered.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]In operation of the FIG. 4 assembly, and in conjunction with the above described embodiment, Magnetron 25 is indicated as a carbon (C) source, magnetron 26 as a Titanium (Ti) source, and magnetron 27 as a copper oxide (CuO) source. The table 21 is first rotated to the position shown, such that the substrate 33 is located beneath the CuO source 27 whereby a thin film (&#8805;10 Å) 9 of CuO is deposited on substrate 33. The table 21 is then rotated so that the substrate 33 is located beneath the Ti source 26 whereby a thin film (&#8805;10 Å) 8 of titanium is deposited on the CuO film 9. At this point, a second film of carbon may be deposited and/or the direction of rotation the table 21 reversed such that the substrate 33 is beneath carbon source 25, then back to the CuO source 27, then to the C source 25, then to Ti source 26, and so on until the desired number of layers of reactive metal, carbon and oxide are deposited on the substrate 33. After completion of the formation of the various layers on the substrate 33, the substrate may be removed, if desired, by polishing, etching, etc. as known in the art, to produce embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]While the above-exemplified fabrication process involved a Ti-C-CuO-C multilayer structure, the same sequence of steps using different magnetron sputter parameters, can be utilized to produce multilayer structures from other metal-carbon-oxide combinations, such as Al-C-CuO, Be-C-CuO, and Ti-Al-CuO, for example. Also, the multilayer structures of FIG. 2 can be highly stressed such that the multilayer structure disintegrate to produce a powder, such as shown at 6 in FIG. 1B. This is accomplished by adjusting the magnetron sputtering process parameters, especially the argon gas pressure, so as to produce a mechanically unstable multilayer film or foil.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]While the three element multilayer of FIG. 2 can effectively actuate the cartridge primer, the two element multilayer described hereinafter with respect to FIGS. 3A and 3B is preferred because it is easier to fabricate and there is a larger selection of reactive elements, and the heat produced thereby is sufficient to actuate the primer.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]FIG. 3A is an enlarged cross-sectional illustration of a two material or element multilayer (RML) structure 5'' using a sequence of titanium-boron (Ti--B), for example, wherein the alternating layers 12 and 13 of titanium and boron have a thickness in the range of 2-20 nm and may be deposited on a layer 14 of pure tin. FIG. 3B is similar to FIG. 3A except that the alternating Ti and B layers are deposited via tin layer 14 on a substrate 15, such as aluminum foil, having a thickness of 5 &#956;m to 50 &#956;m. The aluminum foil could be replaced with a foil composed of Ti, Cu, or an organic polymer (i.e., polypropylene).[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The two material multilayer structure 5'' of FIG. 3A comprises alternating titanium layers 12 and boron layers 13 deposited on a layer of pure tin 14; and as shown in FIG. 3B the alternating titanium-boron layers 12-13 are deposited on an aluminum substrate or film 15 via a layer 14'' of pure tin. The layers of tin 14 or 14'' may be located elsewhere in the multilayer, and more than one layer of tin may be utilized.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The two material multilayer structure of FIGS. 3A or 3B can be produced in an apparatus similar to that of FIG. 4, but with the process parameter modified for the deposition of only two elements, such as titanium and boron. Each of the layers or titanium and boron may have a thickness in the range of 1 to 1000 nm (10-10,000 angstroms), and the number of layers may vary 100 to 10,000, depending on the interfacial energy desired for a specific application. In addition to the alternating layers of Ti and B, the RML may be, but not restricted to Ni--Al, Zr--B, Ta--B, Nb--B, B--C, Al--C, Ti--C, Hf--C, Ta--C, Si--C, Ti--Al, Li--B, Li--Al, and Ni--Ti.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Three specific methods for forming a Boxer style primer utilizing an inorganic reactive (Ti--B) multilayer (RML) explosive material in place of, or in conjunction with, a commercial chemical initiator are set forth hereinafter.[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

LLCP Fabrication By Direct Deposition Method of the RML[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The two element inorganic reactive multilayer, such as illustrated in FIG. 3A is directly deposited by magnetron sputtering of the elements into the cup portion 1 of a primer assembly, such as illustrated in FIG. 1B at 5. Generally, the layer 7 of pure tin would be deposited in the cup 1 prior to depositing the multilayer 5 thereinto. The following sets forth a specific example of a magnetron sputtering process for producing a two material multilayer film, foil, or coating composed of titanium-boron, for example, wherein the alternating layers of titanium and boron have a thickness in the range of 2-20 nm.

LLCP Fabrication by RML Replacement Method[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The two element inorganic reactive multilayer material, such as illustrated in FIG. 3A, is formed by magnetron sputtering, as in Example I above or by other metallurgical processes such as cold-rolling elemental ribbons. The RML is than converted into a powder, and used in place of the standard organic initiator explosive in mixture 2 in FIG. 1A as indicated at 6 in FIG. 1B. The process of Example 1 sets forth a specific example of this process. The reduction of a foil to powder is a standard process in powder metallurgy and ceramic technology. Powder can be produced directly from an RML foil by modifying the sputter deposition process described in Example 1. This is accomplished by depositing the RML at sputter gas pressures below 3 mtorr or above 15 mtorr, thus producing a highly stressed foil that readily disintegrates into a powder. The other process parameters are the same as those given in Example I. While FIG. 1B illustrates both the RML 5 and the RML powder 6, in cup 1, as example only the cup 1 can contain RML 5 only or RML powder 6 only.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]III. LLCP Fabrication by RML Foil Method[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The two element inorganic reactive multilayer of FIG. 3B is formed as a free-standing foil by a process such as cold-rolling of elemental ribbons or as a film by magnetron sputtering the elements directly on to an aluminum foil. A pre-form is then cut from the free-standing foil or the coated aluminum foil and placed directly in the primer cup 1 of FIG. 1A to replace the explosive mixture 2, and thus replace the RML powder 6 and/or the RML 5 of FIG. 1B. The process described in Example 1 can be used to coat the aluminum foil with the RML and it sets forth a specific example of this process. Also, the substrate (aluminum foil) may be composed of titanium or copper or an organic polymer.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]These three methods of fabricating limited-life cartridge primers replace the commercial chemical initiator (mixture 2 of FIG. 1A) currently used in the standard Boxer primer with a comparable amount of RML (components 5 and/or 6 of FIG. 1B). An alternate method of fabricating a LLCP involves the use of a small amount of RML to ignite the standard chemical initiator currently used in commercial primers. This method would require some modifications to the basic design of the Boxer primer. However, it would minimize both increases in manufacturing costs related to the RML materials and changes in primer performance. A modified Boxer primer design that would allow the RML to initiate a larger amount of commercial chemical explosive is illustrated in FIG. 5 wherein RML 5 and layer of tin 7 replaces a portion of the mixture 2 in cup 1. If desired the foil paper 3 of FIG. 1A can be utilized in FIG. 5 between the mixture 2 and anvil 4. The modification essentially involves removing the chemical explosive mixture from the firing-pin striking area of the primer between the anvil and the cup and replacing it with a tin layer and a RML foil. The modified Boxer type LLCP can be fabricated by the procedures set forth in Method I above.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate an embodiment using an RML in a cartridge detonated electronically, with FIG. 7 being an enlarged view of a section of the FIG. 6 cartridge. As shown, a cartridge 40 includes a cavity 41 containing a powder charge 42, a primer, generally indication at 43, with a hole 44 interconnecting the cavity 41 and primer 43. The primer 43 includes an inverted large primer cup 45 having a bottom section 46 and wall section 47, a small primer cup 48 having a bottom section 49 and a wall section 50, an insulator 51 between wall sections 47 and 50, with small primer cup 48 containing a quantity of conventional chemical explosive 52, and an inorganic reactive multilayer (RML) 53 positioned adjacent the bottom section 46 and wall section 50 of small primer cup 48, as seen in FIG. 7. The small primer cup 48 is electrically insulated from the large primer cup 45 via insulator 51 and RML 53 while large primer cup 45 is connected electrically to cartridge 40 and the metal frame of the gun, as seen in FIG. 8. The RML 53 may be constructed from any of the multilayers of the types illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3A and 3B, but preferably of the 3B type with the reactive multilayers deposited on an aluminum foil. The bottom section 46 of larger primer cup 45 is provided with an opening 54 which aligns with hole 44 in cartridge 40.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]In operation, as seen with respect to FIG. 8, the primer 43 of cartridge 40 is electrically activated via a power supply, such as a battery 55 having a negative terminal indicated at 56 and a positive terminal indicated at 57, and a switch, generally indicated at 58, connected between battery 55 and primer 43. Battery 55 may, for example, be of a 1.5-100 V type, with a 9 volt small conventional battery being sufficient. The primer 43 of cartridge 40 is activated as follows:[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]1. The negative terminal 56 of battery 55 is in electrical contact with the inverted large primer cup 45 via the case of cartridge 40, as indicated at 59 in FIG. 8, via the metal frame of a gun 60, as indicated 61.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]2. The battery 55 can be stored in a hollow portion of the gun such as in the pistol grip.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]3. The positive terminal 57 of battery 55 is in electrical contact with the small primer cup 48 of primer 43, as indicated at 62, via the switch 58. This may be accomplished using a separate and isolated probe which includes switch 58 and which attached to positive lead or terminal 57 of battery 55.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]4. Firing of the primer 43 is accomplished by completing the circuit whereby current is allowed to pass from the large primer cup 45 through the small primer cup 48 via the RML 53.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]5. Passing 9 volts, for example, through the RML 53 will cause it to ignite, causing ignition of explosive 52 in small cup 48, as indicated by arrow 63 in hole 44, and thereby initiating the larger charge 42 of standard chemical in initiator materials in cavity 41 of cartridge 40.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]It has thus been shown that the present invention provides limited-life primers and detonators which can be designed to become inactive in a predetermined time. By using an inorganic reactive multilayer material no hazards to the environment are produced, and the sensitivity is determined by the physical structure and the stored interfacial energy. The sensitivity lowers with time, and thus time-dependent interdiffusion is predictable, thereby enabling the determination of the life-time of the primer. Incorporation of a phase changing material prevents extension of the primer life-time by low temperature storage.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]While specific process examples, embodiments, materials, parameters, etc. have been set forth to describe the invention, such are not intended to be limiting.

(505349, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;343289]I think friends are over reacting a bit. One gun malfunctioned, that does not mean every single product the company ever manufactured comes under suspicion. Accidents happen and there are lemon''s in every batches.\n \nThat said, I was very confident of the Caracal F when conducting the test. Not only did I shoot 1100+ rounds though it, I put it though what is hell on earth for any handgun and continued to shoot it past that. If I had doubts I would not risk getting my head busted based on luck. Infact if asked I would not mind shooting 2000 more though the same gun to prove my point. \n\nGlocks, Styers, Sig''s, CZ''s have decades of research and development behind their products. Each of their products is Generation 3 or 4 atleast. Caracal is Gen 1 and for a Gen 1 product in my opinion it''s doing a marvelous job. Might I also mention the affordability factor. Glock, Sig''s and Styers are retailing upwards of 325,000 last I heard. As for CZ they are the best deal in Pakistan right now and for me the best handgun ever made. The day Skeeter60 and I learned of the CZ''s in the local market we were like giddy school kids in a candy shop buying away one of this and two of that :D\n\nI have to say some of the things that I have been reading in this thread left me scratching my head. If my 19 busted would I expect a complete recall of all Glocks ever made or put Glock as a brand under suspicion ? If a Para Ordinance which is an expensive firearm by Pakistani standards (4 times the price of a Caracal) and a established name in the international firearms industry can malfunction and that too a brand new unfired piece, should we then make another thread about taking Para Ordinance to court and start demanding an immediate recall of all Para Ordinance''s ever made ? Sounds silly doesn''t it ?\n\nMy recommendation is simple, to be on the safe side just put away your Caracal C''s for a while till the company analyses the problem and suggests a course of action. As for the Caracal F, I would continue to shoot mine at every opportunity I get.[/QUOTE]\n\n[B]@Abbas...[/B].............Your words above in each and every para reflect a mature mind with the right understanding of affairs from every angle.\n\nI''ve always admired you for your wisdom and cool take no matter what, especially when bearing in mind that you''re younger than most of the knowledgeable seniors here.\n \nWe should learn from your patient attitude towards matters this sort, where most of us only tend to flare up in heat.\n\nI stand fully behind you and I''d agree that we do have occasional lemons within all makes, as also seen recently in the hands of Skeeter Sir, a NIB Para Ordinance leaving off the hammer at 1.st simple, thumb pulling!\n\nThe issue has just been that your 1100 rounds torture test of the F and my simultaneous 1.st buy of the C with perfect running up till now here on the forum, both assisted  people  greatly towards the choice for Caracal handguns.\n\nThen we had our top expert Moeen rejecting it at first instance, and then finally acquiring it and falling in love with it to the extent of suggesting it as a "THE BEST" choice and value-for-money option here. All these things contribute to the popularization of a brand and it''s models. \n\nCaracal must therefore understand that we feel let down here over quality concerns and there was already another issue with the trigger spring cooking on in the background, that Caracal also had been ignoring with empty words of replacements. KKhan''s bad adventure was basically the straw that broke the Arab Camel''s back!\n\nThe longer the Caracal people take in resolving this matter and bringing it to an end, the more bad credit will keep piling up here and elsewhere around the net. Hence, they should come up with something now.\n\nIf the question about who should check out the broken pieces cannot be resolved, why not let a local lab have 1 piece of the slide and Carcal the other to do the metallurgy tests. Once individual reports are in from both  quarters on the metallurgy part, Caracal can have the second piece to do it''s final findings.\n\nSimilarly, the batch of bullets used should be split in two and given to 2 different labs.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(505404, ' [QUOTE=AK47;343448][B]@Abbas...[/B].............Your words above in each and every para reflect a mature mind with the right understanding of affairs from every angle.\n\nI''ve always admired you for your wisdom and cool take no matter what, especially when bearing in mind that you''re younger than most of the knowledgeable seniors here.\n\nWe should learn from your patient attitude towards matters this sort, where most of us only tend to flare up in heat.\n\nI stand fully behind you and I''d agree that we do have occasional lemons within all makes, as also seen recently in the hands of Skeeter Sir, a NIB Para Ordinance leaving off the hammer at 1.st simple, thumb pulling!\n\nThe issue has just been that your 1100 rounds torture test of the F and my simultaneous 1.st buy of the C with perfect running up till now here on the forum, both assisted people greatly towards the choice for Caracal handguns.\n\nThen we had our top expert Moeen rejecting it at first instance, and then finally acquiring it and falling in love with it to the extent of suggesting it as a "THE BEST" choice and value-for-money option here. All these things contribute to the popularization of a brand and it''s models. \n\nCaracal must therefore understand that we feel let down here over quality concerns and there was already another issue with the trigger spring cooking on in the background, that Caracal also had been ignoring with empty words of replacements. KKhan''s bad adventure was basically the straw that broke the Arab Camel''s back!\n\nThe longer the Caracal people take in resolving this matter and bringing it to an end, the more bad credit will keep piling up here and elsewhere around the net. Hence, they should come up with something now.\n\nIf the question about who should check out the broken pieces cannot be resolved, why not let a local lab have 1 piece of the slide and Carcal the other to do the metallurgy tests. Once individual reports are in from both quarters on the metallurgy part, Caracal can have the second piece to do it''s final findings.\n\nSimilarly, the batch of bullets used should be split in two and given to 2 different labs.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nSir, I agree with you. But at the same time, I must say, it takes time to identify the problem, rectifying it, testing the solution, production of the parts and then their shipping. all this takes time. Caracal was quick to recall (which was good) but I don''t think that they had knowledge of the main cause the failure.\n\nRegarding local lab, my point of view is that the lab must have skills set to comment on metallurgy as well as design. If one is missing, the report will not be complete. Secondly, the test of just one weapon will be applicable for specific gun only. It will not apply to one batch or entire production. Even, gun with similar serial numbers can be from different batches. It is only the factory which knows the details.', ''),

Besides, its one of the most used/tested handgun in the world, its all steel construction makes it almost indestructable and absorbs recoil very well, also I(and many shooters around the globe) find it very comfortable to hold.\n\nNow, dont take this the wrong way, the Duty may be a good weapon, but a 75 is an AWSOME weapon.

(505519, ' [QUOTE=Kamranwali;343553]Salam Nazim Sir,\nThe reason why I mentioned the price was because in your original post, u also mentioned best option with respect to price. :)\n\nAs for why I believe the 75 is better, well the answer is really very simple, the 75 is the original product which earned the name for all the CZs, all the other CZ''z are derivatives of the 75. Besides, its one of the most used/tested handgun in the world, its all steel construction makes it almost indestructable and absorbs recoil very well, also I(and many shooters around the globe) find it very comfortable to hold.\n\nNow, dont take this the wrong way, the Duty may be a good weapon, but a 75 is an AWSOME weapon. IMHO, its the must have CZ. Also all other all metal CZ''z are over the 100k mark.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nThank you for your answer.Yes i did initially mention price you are right :)\nI now understand why the CZ 75 would be a better weapon....\nI guess te only way to really decide is to hold both of them side by side and then decide.\nThe fact tat the duty as a polymer frame does appeal a bit to me but since what your saying has alot of logic to it i will have to give the CZ 75 a look as well :)\nThank you for your time.', ''),

Some of them were Webley & Scott 700 series (50''s and 60''s vintage). I knew they were good guns but I just couldn''t justify spending a large amount of money on a middle class ancient English side-by-side. \nIt so happened that I bought my first Webley & Scott 700 few months ago and used it this past hunting season to hunt partridge. The purpose of this thread is to share my experience upland hunting with this gun. \n\nFirst and foremost, they are very popular and sought after guns in Pakistan for the right reason. These guns, like most English quality shotguns, are reasonably light weight. English guns are generally well-made and high quality machines. Among which, Webley & Scott 700 can be considered a mid-range  (ideal for upland hunting) shotgun. They are very well balanced and very forgiving even to the novoice shooters in terms of aiming a bird in flight. \n\nPrice could be debateable. It all depends on who and where and when. Also condition and originality will make all the difference in price. Generally speaking, I have seen anything from Rs.175,000 to Rs. 425,000 and heard about one that sold for RS.550,000 because it was virtually new in box. Most of the ones i''ve seen (serial number 13xxxx to 14xxxx) are manfactured in 1960''s. Its very rare to find one that is extra extra clean but it is possible to find one that hasn''t even left the box it came in. \n\nMine is a 28" barrel length, box lock ejector, straight english stock. The serial number reveals that it was manufactured in 1968. I love the balance and time it takes for this gun to align the object. I enjoyed some great flying shots that I wouldn''t have possibly scored with my Spanish 30" shotgun. \n\nIf you have one of these, hold on to it and if you get a chance to own one you won''t be disappointed. \n\nHere are some pictures of my gun (I am not sure if the pictures loaded correctly or small like icons but I can post links of more pictures in a later post). Thanks for reading and looking at my thread. I hope it was useful to somebody in some way or another:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18624[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]18625[/ATTACH]', ''),

Some of the most popular pistols to purchase are .22lr, .9 mm, .40 cal., and .45 cal., which means that the ammunition is also widely available. In a situation where ammunition becomes scarce, having one of these three calibers, especially 22lr, 9mm and .40 caliber, may allow you to use it as a medium of exchange to trade for other goods. Likewise, it will be much easier to find than other ‘specialty’ ammunition.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Before you purchase a weapon for home defense, you want to take into consideration:\n\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[LIST]\n[*]The price of the firearm, magazine and ammunition \n[*]How much recoil it will have \n[*]Whether or not there is a safety mechanism on the firearm \n[*]What type of firearm offers up the highest capacity for magazines \n[*]And of course, which firearm offers the most stopping power \n[/LIST]\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial][B]9 mm [/B]firearms recoils the least, so it’s generally the easiest of the three to stay on target after pulling the trigger, and usually offers higher capacity magazines compared to the other two. 9 mm is usually the least expensive of the three.

(505636, ' [QUOTE=Leon;343482]Respected Sirs,\n\nAs per my knowledge, United Nation''s "Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition" came into force on July 3, 2005. Under this protocol "Model Law against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition" was proposed. As per this model law, it is essential to give unique marking to each and every weapon and its component produced. However, as per method described in this law, [COLOR=#a52a2a][B]either frame or receiver are required to be marked.\n[/B][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#b22222][B]IMHO, in case of Caracal, serial number has been stamped on slide which is receiver and this is sufficient.[/B][/COLOR]\n\nMeanwhile, for the record purpose, USA, UAE and Pakistan are among the countries which have not ratified this protocol.[/QUOTE]\n\nApart from Caracal specifics & purely for the sake of knowledge sharing (dont want Caracalists to hate me more ;) )   receiver & frame thing seems bit tricky in semi auto pistol as slide acts/operates lot more like a bolt than receiver.\n\nSlide has firing pin block, extracting n feeding mechanism etc combined in it and it moves with each cycle of ejection n feeding that should designate it as a BOLT and frame having all the essentials that facilitate BOLT (slide) to keep/lock it on its track thus acts like a receiver.

(505641, ' All modern weapons have built in devices and design features which prevent an out of battery weapon to fire. Out of battery means the chamber-ing is incomplete and the bolt has not yet locked in with the barrel or the receiver; in case of blow back it means the bolt is not completely closed.\nIt is a disastrous situation as although the barrel remains intact ( chamber gets erroded ) the weapon blows up into pieces breaking the receiver and frame or stock and causing serious injuries or death. The eyes face and hands are injured badly. In case of rifles and high power pistols and shot guns it is very dangerous, almost like a grenade exploding as all gas pressure comes back at you.\nElongating the firing pins or grinding locking surfaces is a veru unsafe practice.', ''),
