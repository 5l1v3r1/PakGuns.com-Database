On game you will fire only one or two shots and never know where the bullets are going , on targets you can fire and learn a d practice a lot also you will not have a guilty conscious of wounding ;  as often animals are wounded and a die a miserable slow death in bushes due to reckless long range shooting.[/quote]\n\nSkeeter60 is more experienced here on this forum when it comes to rifle shooting at least far more experienced then me. But let me add a little piece of information here too,\n\nHe is right " TRAJECTORY ,it is mother earth alone" but wind and temperature cause [b]drag [/b]which can change the bullet landing zones. \n\nWind does have a effect on the TRAJECTORY so do the temperature and barometric pressure for long range shooters.

What is your opinion of the 7x64 Brenneke?[/quote]\n\nA most wonderful German Cartridge which was popular long before the 7mm rem mag in Europe. It is slightly slower than the 7mm Rem Magnum but has a great edge over the 270.\nThe 7 x 64 Brennake  is considered to damage less meat in a game animal while dispatching it as efficiently as the 7mm Rem Mag. This is the opinion held by big game hunters in Europe. The Rem is very slightly flatter in trajectory[/quote]\n\n\nWith that said Col. Sahab, how would you compare the 30-06 to the 7x64 Brenneke, in the Pakistani context? Assuming that either was the only calibre one had to shoot with and if one could get only the 150gr. or the 165gr. bullet in the 30-06, and the 140 gr. bullet in the 7x64, and one wants to shoot wildboar, gazelle, blackbuck, hogdeer, ibex, urial, nilgai, and perhaps markhor as well. \n\nWhich calibre would you prefer and why?', ''),

So before shooting you need to verify that the speed of wind where you are located and next to the target is same. You can do that easily by comparing how much grass is bended in both locations. Or if its a hot weather then do it by mirage waves. :)  That only works if you are targeting long range but for 100,200, ...400 yards very little effect. You will see professional sweating if winds are around 20mph or above as mentioned by Skeeter60.\n\noptimal placement relays on sum of all winds if uni directional or subtract if different direction. \n\nand yes if wind are from you towards target then it has very little effect almost none. But for large game hunt you really dont want to have such a position as air will carry smell of yours right to the animal. \n\nSummary of all above ... \nBullet can travel zigzag under different air or you call it turbulence. \n\nI have this software where you can learn all the calculations and shoot with 3 different calibers include .308 , .338  .50 on different ranges to have something on you before you go real times. Offers good quality but in the end of the day it truly comes from  knowledge share from expert members like skeeter60 and others and practice and given beneficial time to the sports.', ''),

An average of 40 people/vehicle were evacuated by putting a temporary deck to accommodate men on upper deck and women and children in the pickup tub.\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898389278_1587973227_1092485_3151664_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898349277_1587973227_1092484_6012164_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898229274_1587973227_1092481_5219552_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898189273_1587973227_1092480_2184951_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898149272_1587973227_1092479_7231310_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40175_1459958230774_1587973227_1092808_6202715_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40175_1459958070770_1587973227_1092804_7671771_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40175_1459957590758_1587973227_1092792_2927837_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898829289_1587973227_1092496_637592_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40175_1459957230749_1587973227_1092783_7920665_n.jpg[/img]\n\n\nMay Allah ease what is upon us.

What is your opinion of the 7x64 Brenneke?[/quote]\n\nA most wonderful German Cartridge which was popular long before the 7mm rem mag in Europe. It is slightly slower than the 7mm Rem Magnum but has a great edge over the 270.\nThe 7 x 64 Brennake  is considered to damage less meat in a game animal while dispatching it as efficiently as the 7mm Rem Mag.

(135625, ' i have also unfortunately come across a case of accidental discharge from a weapon. Just before the 2008 elections (i mean during the campaign) my father was removing all our guns from the storage room. Due to my interest in firearms, my dad allowed me to help. At that time, my grandmother was just looking through her closet while my dad and I would remove an AK from the suitcase, remove the mag, make sure it was clear, and then put it in another box to clean later. My dad would check each weapon by just removing the magazine, racking the bolt and moving to the next. I would remove the mag, rack the charging handle visually and physically (with my pinky finger) inspect the chamber and then move on to the next AK-all of this while pointing the gun in a safe direction. I told my dad to do as I did but he was in a hurry and said it took too much time the way I did. He also said,[i] tum to bache ho, mujhae zaida patha hai[/i] Then on his last weapon he removed the mag, racked the bolt and pulled the trigger *BANG*!! the gun went off! the 7.62 by 39mm FMJ armour piercing round narrowly (by about 4.5 inches) missed my grandmother! My father had not looked to see whether or not the chamber was loaded. It turned out that the extractor of that AK was broken thus not ejecting the round.\n\nAfter that day my dad is a lot more cautious! Imagine a 40 year old learning from a 15 year old!', ''),

A 165   from a 30-06 will give excellent ballistics and so does a 160 from the 7x64.\n\nThe most important thing is RANGE TIME, spend time on the range and shoot on Paper targets to see what your particular Rifle is doing.

Viking, I beg your apologies, is the product of Russia but after disintegration..Its feel was as if made, primarily to earn the market share on commercial basis...and emphasis seemed to have been given more on saving... metellargy was not good...the spring guide rod evidently spoke of this.. the magazine was paper light..didn''t appear that rugged....

(159691, 'Handgun Cleaning Tutorial (With Pictures); Handgun Cleaning Tutorial; Salams, \n\nA lot of members and friends have asked me time and again on how to clean their handguns. Most new gun owners seldom find the right guidance which results in a much shorter firearms lifespan. I had a couple of guns to clean today so took some pictures to give a basic "How to".\n\n[B]Step 1: Preparation and a few words[/B]\n\nBefore anything check and double check your firearm to confirm it''s empty. Keep your hand off the trigger, take the magazine out, rack the slide a few times, then engage the slide lock in open position and visually inspect the chamber to confirm. The cleaning tools I use are Hoppes Powder Solvent (Approx Rs. 500), Hoppes Lubricating Oil (Rs. 500), Cleaning patching (buy them or cut up on old lint free cotton cloth), Cleaning brush (Rs. 15). Although I don''t use WD40 at all , I have included it in the picture as it can be used in place of both Hoppes products. I don''t like it though and would never use it on my handguns. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThere are 3 main parts of a pistol one must clean, the Barrel, the Slide and the frame.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Step: 2 Cleaning[/B]\n\nTake a small cotton patch (I use Muzzle Loader Shooting Patches from Southern Bloomer U.K) put it over the bottle and turn it upside down on the patch for half a second. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT5.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow clean the barrel using the same patch. Before is before:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is after a using the same patch: Clean using it and another patch if you feel necessary.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT7.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNext run the brush through the barrel a couple of time to loosen any residue stuck in the groves. Then either use the cleaning rod with a patch or put the patch over the cleaning brush and run it though the barrel a couple of times. When the patch gets dirty or misshaped use another one. Dip the second patch with powder solvent and the run it though the barrel again a couple of times. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT8.jpg[/IMG]\n\nVisually inspect the barrel pointing toward the light to see if it''s clean, the slide and frame are to be cleaned the same way. I use the brush on the hammer portion of the frame as well to loosen any grime. Also I use a small flat screwdriver with the cotton patch to clean the grime stuck between the extractor and firing pin plate. \n\nAll clean:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[B]Step: 3 Lubrication[/B]\n\nA lot friends are confused about this one. I have seen educated gun enthusiasts whose pistols are dripping oil. Excess oil does not make your gun run better! All you [U]need [/U]for the entire gun is ONE DROP of oil applied in the right places. I use a cotton ear bud and put a drop of oil on in like shown below:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT10.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThen I apply it to slide and frame like so: \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT11-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT12.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI would also like to mention that some like to use grease instead of oil. That is fine as well as it may or may not help retain accuracy after 5 to 7 thousand rounds. I prefer oil. \n\nAnd that''s all there is to it !  \n\nHere is the gun reassembled and patches and cotton bud used:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/HandgunCleaningT13.jpg[/IMG]\n\n*Misc notes:\n\n1).There is no perfect way to clean/lube guns. Everyone has a slightly different preference. In the write up above I have shown you mine.\n\n2). Some people like to apply a touch of oil to the barrel. I don''t, when fired the oil heats up the barrel much more and over time it will kill your barrel faster. Before storing guns is another matter and again should be cleaned before use. \n\n3). Never dip your handgun slide in Diesel / Mitti ka tail etc. Apart from damaging the finish and smelling nasty, it will get inside the firing pin area, loosen all the grime which in most cases gets stuck on the firing pin causing failures to fire. \n\n4). I disassemble and clean my pistol magazines after about 1000 rounds. \n\n5). I also like to take off the grips every 1000 rounds and clean the grip area from inside. \n\n6). Never fire your gun with the slide off. \n\n7). Loaded or not, always practice gun safety.', 'Handgun Cleaning Tutorial'),

Today, I shot my MP446 Viking at 100 M and noticed a bullet drop of little more than 2 ft approx. I fired 10 bullets on a target,  aiming on top of the head (the target resembled a human figure). All 10 bullet hit on the target in the belly area in a spread of around 18 inches.  Would measure the bullet drops at 75 and 50 Ms also. This gives me confidence that a target can be engaged at 100 M with reasonable accuracy, if one is mindful of the bullet drop at that range from his handgun. I am sure the data would drastically differ from handgun to handgun. Many handguns may not have the capability to hit a target at 100 M, come what may :)\n\nSorry again for being off the topic   :)', ''),

Loaded 2 mags with 3 magtechs, 3 chinese red box bullets, 3 POF 2z, 3 POF 1z, 3 amscor precisions. Not a single misfire, no FTFs and no FTEs.

Viking, I beg your apologies, is the product of Russia but after disintegration..Its feel was as if made, primarily to earn the market share on commercial basis...and emphasis seemed to have been given more on saving... metellargy was not good...the spring guide rod evidently spoke of this.. the magazine was paper light..didn''t appear that rugged....

The Vital are ia 12 inches for an Urial. We also deduct the accuracy potential or let us say a Rifle /ammo combo that you are using is giving you MOA accuracy so you will deduct 3.5 inches from the Vital Area which means your rifle will be within a a circle of 8.5 inches with tha aiming point at its centre whether you shoot at 100 yards or 350 yds without having to worry about any hold over or holding low but you should not be shooting at more than 350 yds.\nNow if you want to take shots on targets ( not game ) at longer ranges; then your MPBR systems gets you into a night mare of calculations. I simply use a range finder (laser RF in my Geovid Lieca Bino ) and I have range compensation scopes and I know the trajectories of each of my Rifles/Reloads like the back of my hand. When not using the range compensating scopes I zeroe my high velocity rifles using bullets of high BC at 300 yds', ''),

I was reading  the colt manual and it says NOT to store revolver in airtight container as it will cause it to rust. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THIS? How do you store yours?[/quote]\n\nAoA\n\nthe manufacturer recommending that blued weapons should not be stored in air tight containers is right. what happens is that you run serious risk of locking moisture inside that air tight container as well which will eventually migrate to metal surfaces cause them to rust.\n\nIf u''r gonna air tight a firearm, the best way to ensure a rust free environment is that you store something to take care of that moisture too. Silica gel is a good solution. make sure to store plenty of it (activated).\n\nanother but slightly technical solution would be to vacuum seal it in a thick plastic bag. no air, no moisture, no rust. you can also throw in a couple of Silica gel pouches just to be double sure.\n\nanother solution would be to throw in a couple of VCI tablets. these is new age stuff. these invisible vapors act just like a lubricant film and cover the metal parts inside out, completely protecting the metal from any sort of rusting or discoloration. no need of vacuum sealing with this technology. you can use any air tight container.\n\nas far as lubing the firearm for extended period is concerned, i''m not a 100% on it. cause lubricants are generally bad for painted finishes and plastics (long term effects). besides, too much lubrication would necessitate a thorough cleaning at the end of the extended storage period. essentially rendering the weapon useless in the event of an emergency.\n\nthe best and easiet in my view would be to order a couple of VCI rust tabs from brownells or any Internet site and throw them in there with the firearm in an air tight container. \n\nVCI plastic bag is also a good option. just put the firearm in a VCI bag and forget it. the bag''s material is made from such a material that gives off VCI vapors.\n\nI hope it helps.\n\nRegards.', ''),

At the end of the day, its all about personal preference.\n\nIf you are comfortable carrying your cheap shotgun among your friends carrying their expensive guns, baikal is okay (though a little heavy to carry in the field), otherwise it depends how deep is one''s pocket.\n\nThe only issue people find with Baikal is its weight and little bit of  imperfect patterning.

IMHO the characteristics of a tank were more found to be in CZ 999. I found it more solid, rugged even accurate than the viking... and what a barrel...carved solid chunk of a metal...  Viking, I beg your apologies, is the product of Russia but after disintegration..Its feel was as if made, primarily to earn the market share on commercial basis...and emphasis seemed to have been given more on saving... metellargy was not good...the spring guide rod evidently spoke of this.. the magazine was paper light..didn''t appear that rugged.... But the Scorpion DOES appear to have every missing thing of the Viking(Though they have saved something by packing it in a card board box) which doesn''t matter in the real sense as the core product offers better quality.\n\nThe scorpion really stings...\n\nJab das jae bichua, zeher jagay bichua.. bach ke tu rehna zara...dholran, dholran mere.....CZ 999[/quote]\n\nAdeel sahib, CZ999 is a top handgun and so is Viking IMHO. We all know that CZ is a Sig P226 clone, which is a proven design. \n\nViking has been produced after years of research by Russian engineers and is a top performer in all respects. I don''t know how you found Viking metallurgy as poor. In my view, metallurgy has always been a top point of all Russian weapons and so is the case with Viking. All metal parts in Viking are made of forged steel. The guide rod that you find poorly made is made of forged steel as well and has been designed to take very high load / pressures. The quality of guide rod spring is also top class. As regards the breach and chamber, I find them amongst the strongest build of all the handguns that I have seen so far and have been designed to take more pressure than any other known handgun in the world in 9x19 caliber. (unlike the belief of few members that the chamber and barrel of Viking is of inferior quality from Grach which has been designed to fire 7N21 and 7N31, I find no difference in the barrel of both). Perhaps you have been influenced by the poor finish on various metal parts. Well, that actually does not effect the performance and has something to do with aesthetics. Russians have always been known for saving money on final finish but not on the strength, ruggedness and durability of the weapon parts. \n\nViking has better sights than a CZ and is more convenient to shoot in rapid fire situation. This is my opinion after firing thousands of rounds from both these handguns. Viking certainly has a better trigger, no doubt about it. It''s the quality that one normally finds in match pistols. Crisp and accurate. And the magazine is also quite solidly built in my view. Even the follower is metallic (in case of CZ its made of plastic). Viking is certainly lighter and easier to carry, even with 18 rounds in the magazine. \n\nThe other day I tested Viking at 100 M. Frankly, I was not expecting to hit anything on the target (which was of the shape of a man torso) but was able to achieve accurate hits and all ten bullets were on the target in an area of around 2 feet. What more one can demand from a handgun  :) With this said, I found CZ comparatively more accurate at shorter ranges. \n\nIMHO, both CZ and Viking are top handguns and one cant go wrong with anyone of them. I love and own both, have fired thousands of rounds from them and personally prefer to carry Viking for SD (and Makarov for CC).  :) \n\nregards', ''),

(136425, ' [quote=Gilani][quote=Syed Adeel]Well, well, well,....!\n\nWith all due respects and apologies upon the advice of the seniors I have compared both CZ 999 and MP 446.... and I wondered as to why has MP 446 been termed as a tank? IMHO the characteristics of a tank were more found to be in CZ 999. I found it more solid, rugged even accurate than the viking... and what a barrel...carved solid chunk of a metal...  Viking, I beg your apologies, is the product of Russia but after disintegration..Its feel was as if made, primarily to earn the market share on commercial basis...and emphasis seemed to have been given more on saving... metellargy was not good...the spring guide rod evidently spoke of this.. the magazine was paper light..didn''t appear that rugged.... But the Scorpion DOES appear to have every missing thing of the Viking(Though they have saved something by packing it in a card board box) which doesn''t matter in the real sense as the core product offers better quality.\n\nThe scorpion really stings...\n\nJab das jae bichua, zeher jagay bichua.. bach ke tu rehna zara...dholran, dholran mere.....CZ 999[/quote]\n\nAdeel sahib, CZ999 is a top handgun and so is Viking IMHO. We all know that CZ is a Sig P226 clone, which is a proven design. \n\nViking has been produced after years of research by Russian engineers and is a top performer in all respects. I don''t know how you found Viking metallurgy as poor. In my view, metallurgy has always been a top point of all Russian weapons and so is the case with Viking. All metal parts in Viking are made of heat treated extra hardened steel. The guide rod that you find poorly made is made of hardened steel and has been designed to take very high pressures. The quality of guide rod spring is also top class. As regards the breach and chamber, I find them amongst the strongest build of all the handguns that I have seen so far and have been designed to take more pressure than any other known handgun in the world in 9x19 caliber. (unlike the belief of few members that the chamber and barrel of Viking is of inferior quality from Grach which has been designed to fire 7N21 and 7N31, I find no difference in the barrel of both). The chrome lining in the Viking barrel is very thick and deep which provides it extra strength. Perhaps you have been influenced by the poor finish on various metal parts. Well, that actually does not effect the performance and has something to do with aesthetics. Russians have always been known for saving money on final finish but not on the strength, ruggedness and durability of the weapon parts. \n\nViking has better sights than a CZ and is more convenient to shoot in rapid fire situation. This is my opinion after firing thousands of rounds from both these handguns. Viking certainly has a better trigger, no doubt about it. It''s the quality that one normally finds in match pistols. Crisp and accurate. And the magazine is also quite solidly built in my view. Even the follower is metallic (in case of CZ its made of plastic). Viking is certainly lighter and easier to carry, even with 18 rounds in the magazine. \n\nThe other day I tested Viking at 100 M. Frankly, I was not expecting to hit anything on the target (which was of the shape of a man torso) but was able to achieve accurate hits and all ten bullets were on the target in an area of around 2 feet. What more one can demand from a handgun  :) With this said, I found CZ comparatively more accurate at shorter ranges. \n\nIMHO, both CZ and Viking are top handguns and one cant go wrong with anyone of them. I love and own both, have fired thousands of rounds from them and personally prefer to carry Viking for SD (and Makarov for CC).  :) \n\nregards[/quote]\n\nGilani sir i agree with everything u said!

(136465, ' AoA Everybody\n\nNow this thread has become more a CZ 999 vs Baikal MP446 even though Taurus PT92 has emerged as a clear winner. anyhow, I''ll throw in my two cents on the subject as well.\n\nBaikal MP446 Viking\n\nfrom metallurgy standpoint, I do not see a reason not to call it a tank. everything about this handgun just oozes ruggedness/robustness. someone mentioned the shape of the guide rod. I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\n\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\n\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nCZ 999 Scorpion\n\na time proven design that has faced the most critique consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\n\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\n\nthe barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside. some say it is a sign of durability, I''ll say not necessarily. but I would rather have inside out chroming instead of only inside chroming. both barrels are hammer forged by the way.\n\nthe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking. I do not what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\n\nwhen it comes to handguns, barrel isnt everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel inserts. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. I would say, that it is weak but I will say that Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\n\nnow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. but thats not the end of it. there are other controls too, CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\n\nBottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):\n\nDurability: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10 (since it incorporates a better barrel)\nReliability: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nControls: Baikal = 8/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nTrigger: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10\nComfort: Baikal = 6/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nAccuracy: Baikal = 8/10 and CZ 999 9/10 (from Gilani Sb''s tests)\nWeight: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10 (slightly heavy)\nField Stripping: Baikal 8/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nmaintenance: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 5/10 (aluminum frame is high maintenance)\nmag capacity: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 9/10 (I do not see a tactical disadvantage)\n[b][color=red]****ease of finding or making accessories/parts: Baikal 0/10 and CZ 999 10/10****[/color][/b]\nBalance and Point-ability: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nAverage Score: Baikal 8.25/10 and CZ 999 Scorpion 8.85/10 (CZ 999 wins only by a slight margin, totally negligible and inconclusive in my opinion)\n\nExplanation:\n\nin my view, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion which (possibly but not necessarily) compromises on durability takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when I go to a store to buy a pair of boots, I buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t I go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip my feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different. any tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\n\nhowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day. however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers alot more than just durability so do look into it.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. @Gilani Sb. I hope the change made to the red color line addresses any reservations that you might have. what I meant to say that (in my humble and personal opinion) you can do alot more with CZ 999 than what you could do with Baikal. from customization standpoint, adjustable sights can be bought (with baikal, no way possible unless one is blessed with a "Russian Connection"). with CZ 999 recoil guide rods/spring, hammer spring, spurred/target hammer and slide lock spring (actually its a wire) can be changed with standard PIG P226. therefore from repair standpoint, CZ999 offers alot more than Baikal. so, given the two, I feel CZ 999 Scorpion is a better handgun (just my humble opinion, i''m not suggesting anything with absolute certainty and with full knowledge that esteemed members are welcome to reject my sentiments.)', ''),

(136494, ' [quote=12gauge]AoA Everybody\n\nNow this thread has become more a CZ 999 vs Baikal MP446 even though Taurus PT92 has emerged as a clear winner. anyhow, I''ll throw in my two cents on the subject as well.\n\nBaikal MP446 Viking\n\nfrom metallurgy standpoint, I do not see a reason not to call it a tank. everything about this handgun just oozes ruggedness/robustness. someone mentioned the shape of the guide rod. I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\n\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\n\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nCZ 999 Scorpion\n\na time proven design that has faced the most critique consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\n\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\n\nthe barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside. some say it is a sign of durability, I''ll say not necessarily. but I would rather have inside out chroming instead of only inside chroming. both barrels are hammer forged by the way.\n\nthe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking. I do not what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\n\nwhen it comes to handguns, barrel isnt everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel inserts. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. I would say, that it is weak but I will say that Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\n\nnow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. but thats not the end of it. there are other controls too, CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\n\nBottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):\n\nDurability: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10 (since it incorporates a better barrel)\nReliability: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nControls: Baikal = 8/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nTrigger: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10\nComfort: Baikal = 6/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nAccuracy: Baikal = 8/10 and CZ 999 9/10 (from Gilani Sb''s tests)\nWeight: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10 (slightly heavy)\nField Stripping: Baikal 8/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nmaintenance: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 5/10 (aluminum frame is high maintenance)\nmag capacity: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 9/10 (I do not see a tactical disadvantage)\nease of making more magazines yourself: Baikal 0/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nBalance and Point-ability: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nAverage Score: Baikal 8.25/10 and CZ 999 Scorpion 8.85/10 (CZ 999 wins only by a slight margin, totally negligible and inconclusive in my opinion)\n\nExplanation:\n\nin my view, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion which (possibly but not necessarily) compromises on durability takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when I go to a store to buy a pair of boots, I buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t I go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip my feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different. any tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\n\nhowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day. however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers alot more than just durability so do look into it.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\n+ he +', ''),

(136681, ' @Aquarius and Gilani Sb.\n\nNo! sir, no ziyadti here. I am only expressing what I feel. it is not a definitive answer just my personal opinion. I feel that CZ 999''s parts bear more commonality then other handguns available in Pakistan then Baikal.\n\nfor example:\n\n1. Magazine:\nberetta mags, the most common mags available in the market can be easily converted into CZ 999 mags by any competent-enough gunsmith.\n\n2. Recoil guide rod:\nbeen there, done that. any good machinist can do one hell of job due to simplicity of the design of CZ 999''s guide rod. whereas with Baikal, it is a remote possibility if not impossible.\n\n3. Recoil guide spring:\nmeasured and confirmed that a Standard "braided" SIG P226 recoil spring is compatible CZ 999 Scorpion. so incase if one weakens the recoil spring due to repetitive firing, a replacement can be ordered easily off the Internet.\n\n4. Hammer and hammer spring\none can easily replace CZ 999 hammer and spring with SIG hammer and spring.\n\n5. Slide stop spring (actually its a "S" shaped tension wire)\nreplaceable with Sig\n\n6. extractor\nnow thats the interesting part. the extractor can be replaced with Sig P226 (early version only) extractor and better yet, one can get it made here. its just claw at the end of a long (also peened) and flat piece of metal. any good competent gunsmith can make it by hand by shaping a long and flat piece of metal. Baikal''s extractor however is already quiet strong so I would say its not easily breakable. however if anyone ends up breaking it would be in really high waters.\n\nFinally:\n\nParts replacement in my humble opinion is not a matter of "if one should" its only a matter of "if one has to". therefore I gave CZ 999 max marks whereas Baikal was given zero marks. this is just my opinion. your mileage may vary.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(136953, ' Salam everyone! \n\nReached home a while back. Quite exhausted and tired and for all the right reasons but not really bothered about it. Since I AM sleepy, here''s a "Little Summary";\n\nThe members of PakGuns/Defence.pk, it''s because of [u]you[/u] people that we were able to successfully carry out Phase-II of the relief efforts. Let there be no doubt that you guys have always been the backbone of this entire operation. Without your generous support both moral and financial, none of this could have been possible so once again, Hats off to each and every single one of you. Proud to know these amazing communities. \n\n[b]Ka_Khan[/b], No words yet again. I''ll try and talk about this person in third-person-mode. He''s one hell of a tough individual but utterly modest and caring at heart. His hospitality and concern for everyone around him speaks volume about his character. The man''s here to serve the people and once again has been able to show us the level of dedication and devotion he''s composed of. \n\nHats off to you Janab! May Allah almighty reward you for all the efforts that you''ve put in. \n\nA special thanks to our Admin, [b]Abbas[/b] for let this whole chain of events unfold. Without your approval from PG, the members at PG wouldn''t have been involve in this entire relief effort. Props to you! Though you weren''t with us for Phase-II because of your commitments, I can assure you that LWL was dearly missed. ;) \n\nNot to forget brother [b]Ilyas[/b], his efforts have been immense even though he''ll always deny them.  :) As I was telling you before, no matter what we went through in blistering heat (while fasting) and carrying out relief work, your company made sure that every single one of that fatigue germ goes right out the window. Speaking of Hospitality, he''s second to none and I''m proud to know that such brothers from PakGuns exist in every single city of Pakistan. He was with us every single step of the way both practically AND Spiritually! :D God bless you brother! \n\nSpecial thanks to my cousin[b] Rauhan[/b] (Who''s just like my younger brother) and our captain  of the ship, [b]Khan Shah Faras[/b] for driving us wherever we went. Never tired and always ready to serve. Both of these people are very dear to me and they made sure that I reach Peshawar and the effected areas to actively take part in this relief effort. God bless you guys! \n\nOur member from Defence.pk/PakGuns [b]TaimiKhan[/b] also volunteered and helped us during our relief efforts. He also gathered donations on behalf of Defence.pk and made sure that he was there with everyone to help out. Was with us when we went to ChaarSada and actively took part in all the relief work. Everyone had a great time in your company and InshAllah hope to see you soon. \n\nThank you Dr [b]Jiya[/b] for taking the time out to join us on this relief mission. She represented Defence.pk during the trip and gathered donations from Islamabad and abroad. She''s also involved with some NGO''s and InshAllah she''s planning to visit the flood hit areas again with a team of doctors and meds. God Bless you for all your support. Btw, congratulations on becoming a part of this awesome community! You won''t regret it!  :) \n\nIn short, life is pretty miserable for our countrymen in these testing times. [b]Our efforts might just have  been a drop in the ocean but after every single drop there''s always a storm on its way. \n[/b]\n\nGod Bless Pakistan.\n\nPictures and more commentary after a break!  :)', ''),

(136979, ' [quote=Gilani]\nBasing on to the results of these tests, [b]I would like to advise the fellow members that whatever ammo you use in your handgun, please test its point of impact on a paper target and accordingly make adjustments in your aim.[/b] Please note that these tests have been carried out with PT99 which is one of the most accurate handguns available in Pakistan in 9x19 para. With other handguns which are not that accurate, this difference in the performance of various ammos would multiply. Firer''s ability to shoot accurately would also make a lot of difference. Therefore, please do not carry that ammo for SD which you have not thoroughly tested on a paper target and about whose point of impact on the  target, you are not very clear. \n[/quote]\n@Gilani sb, This test does prove that we need to test the ammo as much as our weapons. And have to ensure that atleast for an active shooter, what ever batch of ammo is purchased, it is tested thoroughly as well, particularly Chinese and POF, where there is more possibility of variation between batches.\nHowever, as you have said between the lines that as this test was performed with one of the most accurate hand guns, the results may vary considerably with other handguns, particularly the ones with the shorter barrel/smaller frames. \nIt also actually means that if we compare the groups in handgun accuracy test thread (tests performed preferably on the same day), we could figure out the comparitive difference of same ammo (POF 2Z) in various weapons.\nThis, could also mean that the handgun accuracy test has one more variable, the ''behaviour'' of ammunition. We could have a total different set of rankings on changing the ammo, particularly in the accurate-very accurate group of hand guns.\n\nI am thinking if the picture would remain same, or change with a different ammo, as in the below link \n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=133403#p133403[/url]\n\nPlease note that above link is NOT pasted to start a new scorpion vs viking, this is one of the few times that similar/competing weapons have been shot with same ammo  :)', ''),

However, in case of these two particular guns, whatever ammo we may fire, the CZ would perform more accurately than Viking, IMHO. This can not however be taken as a standard performance for all CZ and Viking handguns because each handgun (even of the same type) will have its own character and would be slightly different from the other. You change the guns and you may see a Viking performing better than CZ. Talking of the law of averages, IMHO, CZ is a slightly more accurate gun than Viking. Means if we fire 10 Vikings and CZs than may be 7 CZs would perform better than Vikings and 3 Viking may perform better than CZs, whatever the ammo.

A very solid input  :)  I think more of us need to understand this thing that the proverb "You get what you pay for" does not fully work in case of weapons in Pakistan. One can always buy a very reliable weapon in say 50k and can also end up buying the similar performance weapon with a better finish but a much bigger name in say 250 k. But this understanding, if acquired by majority of our gun enthusiasts, would be detrimental for the weapon dealers who are making huge profits by selling cheap weapons like Glock etc in exorbitant prices. They know that Pakistani gun enthusiast is "brand" conscious and would pay anything for  the brand name. I am not taking away anything from names like Glock, Beretta and Benelli etc but I just feel that they are too over priced in Pakistan viz-a-viz the quality they offer.

And if you compare, it is the same barrel which comes in most of the Vikings available in Pakistan. Actually all Vikings that I have seen have the same shape of the chamber. \n\nHowever, the reviewer also mentioned that a different design of chamber and also be found in some other MP446 Viking models though he did not comment whether the chamber in sporting models differs in performance from those in military models. This means that Baikal guys are not really very fussy about Viking designs and keep changing them as per the requirement / demand. \n\nGood thing is that the Vikings available in Pakistan have the barrel / chamber designed for the military version.  :D[/quote]\n\nGilani Sir/Brother/Sahib :) I have no doubt that you are one who has the best knowledge and exp with handguns I have great respect for you in my heart though I never said this before but I would love to be in your company atleast once in my life :) now lets come to the point in which I am not saying that what information you have provided is wrong or just your own perception even its your own I believe its right the owner manual of viking says that MP 446 is also avlble in steel version and civilians can buy that too manual is also in russian language which means they are also addressing the civilian gun market of russia if its not legal to to to give the same gun which is in use of military to civilians thn how can we say that MP 446 in steel version is MP 443 ? because military handgun can not be sold to civilians I never said that MP 446 and MP 443 are different from chamber they can be same and they are, the only thing I have in my mind is the the quality of barrel of MP 443 is better thn MP 446 but also again I am satisfied with my Viking more thn glock,H&k, or berreta , I think one can''t say anything about the quality of barrel just by looking at it unless we hold the both barrels in our hands or we have some techinal/scientific data how the barrel is manufactured , I am also looking for these answers this is what I think I have few things to support my statement which I shared in my previous post in the same thread  but not enough to believe ,', ''),

(137167, ' Crazy Shooter brother, I am grateful for the comments  :) We will inshallah meet when I next visit Abbotabad. \n\nYou are right that so far we don''t have a conclusive evidence that the quality of barrel of the sporting version, ie, MP446 has been [b]reduced[/b] from that of MP443, the military version, in order to make it incapable of firing the high pressure 7N21 and 7N31 rounds, which are purely intended for military use. However, I think we do not disagree on this that the military version barrel is capable of firing 7N21 & 7N31. Is it? \n\nNow,  the video shown above clearly mentions the difference between a military and a sporting barrel. As per the reviewer, the one shown in the video is a military barrel. When I compare the barrel of my MP446 with the barrel of MP446 shown in the video, they are exactly the same. If that be the case, and if we feel that the information provided by the reviewer is authentic than the MP446 that I own and those owned by all my friends (including yours also I believe) have a military version barrel fitted in it (and I have no reasons so far to disbelief in the information provided in the video because the reviewer is doing the review for Vinzer Sport who are the authorised importers of Viking in Canada). \n\nUnless we find evidence to disbelieve in this video or find some other evidence which conclusively negates this video, we all should be happy that we possess Vikings which are capable of taking very high pressure rounds. Though 7N21 etc may never be available in Pakistan and even if they are available, would hardly be of any use for common users like us, we can safely assume that our Vikings can undergo any kind of ordeal with regards to high chamber pressure and would have a very long life with standard 9x19 ammos. \n\nthanks and regards', ''),

I have always said that when I compare 809e with MP446, CZ999 and Canik55 Piranha etc, I find 809e lagging behind these guns in accuracy, reliability and shooting ability. Now this is a comparison and does not at all prove that 809e is overall a bad gun. Moreover, if 809e was available in 40K, I would have had no issues with it. It is the significantly higher price as compared to the other above mentioned pistols viz-a-viz displayed performance that actually forms the core of my argument. With a higher price, 809e should offer a proportionately better performance which in my humble view, it does not.  \n\nSince you practice a lot, your input would really matter here. I would request you to shoot with MP446 and CZ999 etc as well and than see the difference. I am sure it would be an interesting input for all of us.  :) \n\nregards', ''),

(137207, ' [b]AoA Everybody[/b]\n\nI have seen quiet many thread here which eventually turn into "can baikal fire the all magical/mystical 72N1 rounds?". well....in a bid to finally put this debate to end, I have decided to jump in and offer my two cents on the subject. Kindly accept my apologies if my opinions do not live up to member expectations.\n\n[b]Here we go:[/b]\n\n[b]first of all[/b], why are we even discussing something which is absolutely useless for us to begin with? what I mean to say is that the probability of someone finding such an ammo is as remote as going to Mars for some family vacation. in our life time that is. therefore even if baikal has such a capability, its pointless to discuss it, let alone brag about it.\n\n[b]Second[/b], there is no hard evidence that Baikal can fire the "mystical" rounds. similarly there is not even a single shred of evidence that it cannot. as of today, all the talk and long discussions are based on circumstantial evidence. not documented fact and [b]I''m also not doing anything different[/b].\n\n[b]Third[/b], if through deductive reasoning we can conclude that baikal can fire the "mystical" round, we can also conclude that a chicken can lay an elephant''s egg. believe me, both hypotheses are in the same ball park. if you do not believe me then I welcome members to debate whether Taurus PT92/99 can or cannot fire a "XXX888XXX" round. this XXX888XXX round has been designed to fire man sized targets at the north pole while standing at the south pole. the mean deviation of the round has been calculated at 2 microns (center to center) at gazillion yards. Be prepared, I can even prove that Taurus PT92/99 can lay an egg if sing your melody right.\n\n[b]Fourth[/b], lets talk about the manual. you know that little book in which manufacturer usually tells something important about their product. the same book that we can consult if we ever doubt any ability of the product. sometimes, just reading the manual can save us from spending countless hours in debating something otherwise a total non-issue. if we look at the manual, we''ll see that Baikal lists MP446 Viking as a [b]"Training and Sporting Pistol"[/b]. why would a manufacturer intentionally list a handgun for training or sporting purposes having an ability to fire the "hardcore military" ammo?\n\n[b]Fifth[/b], Russia is not a country where civilians are allowed to own handguns, let alone owning handguns that can fire the "uber hardcore military" rounds. I''m intentionally trying to avoid using the actual designation of the ammo. quiet difficult for me get it right.\n\n[b]Sixth[/b], why would a company invest in a handgun which can fire the "mystical round" but give it in the hands that do not need to fire such a round. from purely economics point of view, its not feasible. A sound minded (specially a manufacturer nearing bankruptcy, HINT: BAIKAL) would never make such a product. such a manufacturer would rather save cost in a bid to increase profit margins.\n\n[b]Seventh[/b], there is a little thing called PROOFING. every firearm gets a proof mark, designating it "fit for service" for that particular type of ammo. if we look at baikal''s barrel, its clearly proofed marked with 9*19. I have yet to see a baikal MP446 Viking proofed marked with 7N21 and 7N31 proof marks. now don''t give me explanation that Russians are super smart and they don''t want the public to know that they have a nasty killing machine in their hands. This would not fly. cause it kinda sounds funny, "comrade! give them the ability but don''t tell them cause its bad for business. shhhhh!"\n\n[b]Eighth[/b], Lets assume Baikal MP446 Viking is an "export-only" product. would you, being a manufacture export a product that can fire armor piercing bullets? while knowing that such a handgun would be instantaneously labeled as Cop killer or a terrorist''s handgun.\n\n[b]Ninth[/b], my take on the enormous size of the Baikal MP 446 Viking barrel would be that since its dimensionally same as the GRACH model, it was important to make Viking in same dimensions as well to avoid any serious functional changes. another possibility would be to make it extra strong to compete with several foreign brands that are available in Euro market for alot less money. but it still does not suggest in any way 7N21 and 7N31 variant firing capability.\n\n[b]Tenth[/b], lets talk on the strength of baikal''s barrels. i''m assuming that the Russians are not using any such technology that it out of this world and so top secret (specially after the fall of the iron curtain) that the advanced Europeans have not caught up with. from muzzle end or should I say, at the thickest part, the barrel diameter for the famously weak GLOCK 17 is 17.7mm . the barrel diameter of famously insignificant SIG P226 is 15mm. the barrel dia of famously worthless HK USP (9mm handgun) is 16mm. but what about the symbol of brute strength, the Baikal?. well, the barrel diameter is just 13mm. unless Russians are using some sort of out of this world, unheard off and sworn into absolute secrecy type technology I would say, the barrel diameter (from the muzzle where its supposed to be the thickest part of Baikal''s barrel) suggests its nothing out of the ordinary and hardly impressive.\n\n[b]Eleventh[/b], quoting importers/dealers might sound logical and quiet convincing I must admit, however members are requested to understand that even exporters/dealers are required to boast their product''s ability in a bid to increase sales. specially when they know that "the magical" bullet is non existent in parts of the world where they intend to sell that product. its just another sales pitch gentlemen!. They know there is no accountability as long as long as their customers do not have access to armor piercing rounds. another thing that we must understand is that all guarantees should be in writing. now you know why responsible manufacturers always write "manufacturer reserves the right to change specs without notice".\n\nI was once told by an importer that Russian firearm steel is the best in the world cause they used metal from recycled T-1/T-2 Tanks and it will not rust even when submerged in salt water for 100 years. good thing I never tested his claim. I simply checked the manual for any mentioning of such thing and ignored the whole idea.\n\n[b]Summary:[/b]\n\nnothing can be said about Baikal''s ability to fire 7N21 and 7N31 ammo. its all talk and no hard evidence. proving is as difficult (and easy if connecting dots is the name of your game) as rejecting. therefore this particular attribute/quality/variable should be omitted while evaluating Baikal MP446 Viking.\n\n[b]Regards.[/b]\n\np.s. now lets start another debate "it can fire". :) i''m all prepared for that as well. again with 11 points to prove that it can.  :cool:', ''),

(137223, ' This discussion will be very interesting as normally the three bores used commonly in Pakistan are 7.63X25mm, 9X19mm and 0.45ACP. Each of these calibers have there advantages and disadvantages, and its a fact that while talking of bullets bigger is not always better - consider for example the 300 joule energy of 0.45 bore is far less than 410 + joules of 9mm. Then think of the muzzle velocity as well, which is 250 m/sec for 0.45bore which again is inferior to 350 m/sec for the 9mm. Infact the 9mm tend to reach 400 m/s with longer barrel lengths (i.e 120mm+).\n\nSo in light of the above mentioned facts, i feel that a discussion will be very productive and informative as well - i also feel that this is really a new topic and will generate a lot of interest.', ''),

(137234, ' There are four species of venomous snakes found in Pakistan: Common Krait, Scaled Viper, Russell’s Viper and Cobra. Almost all snake are warm blooded serpents. Therefore, snakes are unable to tolerate cold. However, in the month of September and early October, they are still out there. \n	Many bites are avoidable. Prevention is easy, wear your high boots or ask cobbler fix you high top boots. If that is not feasible, get the leather chaps or called legging. This is a just a piece of leather or any other suitable material 1 ft X 8 inches cylindrical shape open ends tight together either by Velcro or stitch pairs of small buckles. Wear it on your legs over your shoes. Do not place your hands in blind spots. Snakes are nocturnal. They hunt at night and most active in the evenings. watch out around the water ponds and under the bushes. Mornings are their rest time but can strike. For safety sake, never hunt alone and never hunt with a crowed either.\n	Now, if you are bit by a snake, remember, remain calm. Panic will increase your heart rate and snake venom will go through your blood circulation fast. Most of the bites are blanks. Snakes have tough time to inject venom. Bites are not a death sentence, most of the victims do survive. \n	Immediately, sit down, dangle you legs below the heart. Do not walk. Call for help immediately. If you have iced or cold pack place it directly over the snake bite. \n	You can place a torncate 6 inches above the bite. However, truncates are dangerous because, it will stop the blood reaching to the tissue, and you can loose your limb. Simple, truncate is just a small piece of rope or cloth.  To make a loop, tie the knot but leave 2-3 inches space between the skin and the rope. Slip  a small peace of a stick through the loop,  and start rotating the stick. As you rotate the stick, the torncate will tighten itself. Check the pulse below the strike. You should feel the bounding pulse, this is where you stop tightening the truncate. Take another peace of  rope tie the rope around the limb and then tie the one part of the stick to it. This will stop the truncate from unwinding. Now, you must unwind the torncate every 10-15 minutes then retighten. This is all you need until medical help arrives\n	Anti venom is called polyvalent and effective against all four species mentioned above. However, antivenin therapy is not for the novice. Leave this to the doctor. And I do n’t know if the Polyvalent anti snake venom is readily available in Pakistan? You can not keep in your first aid box because it needs refrigeration. \nNow, I like to hear from the expert in this matter.', ''),

To me, a firearm is just like another tool/toy/equipment. it should offer durability as well as comfort and luxury for the owner/operator. thats just my opinion, your mileage may vary.\n\nsecond is the availability of parts incase you break something. I know, the probability of breaking something in these two handguns is quiet small but nonetheless, it can happen as the famous Murphy''s law states [b]IF ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG, IT WILL[/b]. with CZ 999 Scorpion, you can almost certainly find replacements online in the shape of SIG P226 parts (spring and sprockets). you can also use local made sig parts (clone SIGs). they may not be as long lasting as original sig parts but they will get your gun working ASAP. some of the parts that are not "drop-in type" can be easily modified from SIG P226 parts either original or clone.\n\nthen there is the magazine issue, beretta mags can be easily converted into CZ 999 Scorpion mags by any competent gunsmith in a matter of minutes. since the local market is practically floods with beretta mags (clone or original), the cost of such a converted mag is unbelievably small.\n\nThere u go, I have expressed my opinion on the subject. This is just my opinion based on what I like and do not like in a handgun. your mileage may vary.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I''ve used this product and found it better than WD40. when it comes to lubrication only, it is not as good as dedicated lubricants such as hoppes, militec PG lubricant however for emergency usage it is quiet good. it does not gum up like WD40. it is clean burning and will not leave any residue. I have also lubricated firing pin channels with it and found no ill effects whatsoever with this. however when you do spray it inside the firing pin channel make sure to make it a regular cleaning routine. otherwise once sprayed can trap firing residue and lock the firing pin in place causing firing pin related reliability issues. you dont want to do that. first rule do not lubricate the firing pin channel but if you still want to, then make sure to clean and lubricate every time you clean your shotgun.\n\none more thing, to ensure maximum lubrication of your firearm, I would recommend a specialty lubricant. CLPs (cleaner, lubricant and protectant) are at best mediocre in each and every department. something like jack of all, master of none kinda deal working here with CLPs. only dedicated lubricants can ensure optimum lubrication and long service life of your firearm. for occasional firing, even CLPs are more than good enough. however for extended firing sessions, only dedicated lubricants should be used.\n\nRegards.', ''),

If the gun is even a 25% fit and have a crap trigger, a decent shooter will still shoot good.\n\nHowever, for competition shooting of Trap and Skeet the gun does make a lot of difference and since this post is about Skeet and Trap shooting so this becomes more relevant.\n\nLets just park the cost of the gun on one side and lets talk on performance merit alone.\n\nThere are three different stages of Trap and Skeet shooting:\n\n1st - This is where you learn to shoot.\n2nd - This where you learn to shoot in competition.\n3rd - This is where you learn to win a competition.\n\nMost of Pakgunners are beginners so we will only discuss the 1st Stage.\n\nWhen you start shooting Skeet or Trap you can pretty much use any gun you wish with 28" barrel and Skeet choke for skeet and 30" barrel with a tight choke for trap to see whether you like it or not and you can easily score 15 to 19 per round. \n\nHowever, if you like it and wants to proceed further it is imperative that you develop a good sound technique, for this you will require that your equipment has to be of certain standard.\n\nThe most important thing in a shotgun is its balance, shot pattern, trigger and its gun fit.\n\nThe Berreta, Browning and Perrazi will offer the first three, however, if your gun is not custom made for you, you will have to get it altered to fit you.    \n\nOnce these four things are sorted, you will have to develop your focus and swing and will have to work hard to get your average score above 110 out of 125 and once this is done you are ready to proceed to stage 2.\n\nLet me tell you a secret if you do the stage 1 properly i.e. you develop a proper technique with a good reliable gun then the Stage 2 & 3 is only stage 1 + mental strength. \n\nSo if I give an advice to those who wants to take Skeet and Trap Shooting seriously buy a good gun and practice with it until it becomes an extension of your body.

(137385, ' [quote=Gilani]Crazy Shooter brother, I am grateful for the comments  :) We will inshallah meet when I next visit Abbotabad. \n\nYou are right that so far we don''t have a conclusive evidence that the quality of barrel of the sporting version, ie, MP446 has been [b]reduced[/b] from that of MP443, the military version, in order to make it incapable of firing the high pressure 7N21 and 7N31 rounds, which are purely intended for military use. However, I think we do not disagree on this that the military version barrel is capable of firing 7N21 & 7N31. Is it? \n\nNow,  the video shown above clearly mentions the difference between a military and a sporting barrel. As per the reviewer, the one shown in the video is a military barrel. When I compare the barrel of my MP446 with the barrel of MP446 shown in the video, they are exactly the same. If that be the case, and if we feel that the information provided by the reviewer is authentic than the MP446 that I own and those owned by all my friends (including yours also I believe) have a military version barrel fitted in it (and I have no reasons so far to disbelief in the information provided in the video because the reviewer is doing the review for Vinzer Sport who are the authorised importers of Viking in Canada). \n\nUnless we find evidence to disbelieve in this video or find some other evidence which conclusively negates this video, we all should be happy that we possess Vikings which are capable of taking very high pressure rounds. Though 7N21 etc may never be available in Pakistan and even if they are available, would hardly be of any use for common users like us, we can safely assume that our Vikings can undergo any kind of ordeal with regards to high chamber pressure and would have a very long life with standard 9x19 ammos. \n\nthanks and regards[/quote]\n\nGilani Brother I am waiting for your reply on the Video because in this video the guys says that sporting version have straight borders I have not seen any MP 446 with a straight chamber but I have seen MP 443 the military version with straight chamber does this makes this video unreliable ? because the guy seems to have no knowledge about this handgun its just a kind of advertising and attracting people that they can have a pure russian military weapon in canada ? also your comments on the comparison of these two models I have post pics comparing both and you can clearly see the military version with straight chamber', ''),

(137391, ' [quote=Salahuddin Ayubi][u][b]My Experience with Rangers during Snap Checking while Section 144 is imposed in Karachi:[/b][/u]\n\nI''d like to share my experience today with Rangers during a snap check in Karachi, while I was on my way to the shooting range and had two pistols and one shotgun in my car boot with a few hundred rounds of different caliber.\n\nI was stopped on Main University Road. One of the ranger personnel approached me while I was in the car and the following exchange took place:\n\nQ) Coming from?\nA) Home - told him the address\n\nQ) Going to?\nA) Shooting Range - told him which one\n\nQ) Want to search the car\nA) By all means - and telling him before hand that there are licensed weapons and ammo in the car''s trunk.\n\nAll guns and ammo were taken out of the trunk and taken to the ranger mobile parked nearby. I was asked for my licenses and carrying permits if I have any. I gave them my licenses and informed them that although I have permits but they stand canceled and are of no use.\n\nAll guns and magazines were empty and in hard cases. Ammo was kept separately. Guns and ammo were in the boot (i.e., locked condition).\n\nLicenses were checked. Details of it were matched with my CNIC. Serial numbers of each weapon were matched with the license. Renewal was checked. Ammo was counted and noted along with all other details about me and the guns & ammo on a piece of paper by an SI rank ranger person, who happened to be the senior most among them available there. \n\nHe then made a call to his superior, a Colonel rank officer in the 31st wing situated at Toll Plaza, Karachi and told him all my and guns&ammo details along with the fact that all documents are in order and that I was proceeding from my home to a shooting range and that all guns were empty and in locked condition. His superior asked him to wait. After about 25 mins from that phone call, the Colonel called the SI and asked him to let me proceed to my destination. He apparently cross-checked my details some database they might be having\n\nI was handed over my stuff and requested to check everything and make sure that nothing was missing. Two ranger personnel helped me pack everything back in my bag. We shook hands and I proceeded to the range.\n\nNo references were used. I played cool during the whole while and cooperated with them. I helped them match the details of CNIC with license and of license with gun/ammo. I also informed them voluntarily the ammo quantity I was carrying and the ammo limits on my licenses, which was enough to cover the quantity I was carrying.\n\nOverall, I had to wait for an hour before I was asked to go (30 mins to match the details plus around another 30 mins awaiting further orders from HQs). \n\nDuring my discussion with the ranger''s SI rank officer, I asked him what if I had my .45 in the front with me instead of locked in booth, with mags full, what then? He replied that it would not have made any difference and the procedure and end result would have been the same.\n\nTherefore, it is my firm conclusion, that if you have all your documents in order and are on the right side of law, this Section 144 does not effect you (being an honest tax paying genuine citizen) to keep a weapon in your car, even if it is loaded. \n\nHope this helps.[/quote]\n\n+1000 sir. Knowing how tricky it is to interpret our laws and the lack of information out there regarding how to go about dealing with such encounters, we should post more accounts of similar situations. I live in an area with sensitive installations, consulates and govt. offices all around and police patrolling is thus quite heavy here. After the initial experiences with getting pulled over and the discussion taking too much of my time every time, I decided the best way is to coolly give a full introduction as soon as the policeman comes to your window before he asks you any questions i.e. your name, father''s name (mine''s a senior army officer) and where you live. Then he''ll just perform his duty as per routine and not harass you, and you''re off shortly.', ''),

I''ve used this product and found it better than WD40. when it comes to lubrication only, it is not as good as dedicated lubricants such as hoppes, militec PG lubricant however for emergency usage it is quiet good. it does not gum up like WD40. it is clean burning and will not leave any residue. I have also lubricated firing pin channels with it and found no ill effects whatsoever with this. however when you do spray it inside the firing pin channel make sure to make it a regular cleaning routine. otherwise once sprayed can trap firing residue and lock the firing pin in place causing firing pin related reliability issues. you dont want to do that. first rule do not lubricate the firing pin channel but if you still want to, then make sure to clean and lubricate every time you clean your shotgun.\n\none more thing, to ensure maximum lubrication of your firearm, I would recommend a specialty lubricant. CLPs (cleaner, lubricant and protectant) are at best mediocre in each and every department. something like jack of all, master of none kinda deal working here with CLPs. only dedicated lubricants can ensure optimum lubrication and long service life of your firearm. for occasional firing, even CLPs are more than good enough. however for extended firing sessions, only dedicated lubricants should be used.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\n\n12guage bro,\nin a different thread i studied one of your detailed issue about  daudsons, since i''m searching a 9mm handgun, are daudsons marketing 9mm pistols for domestic sales...\nregards...\nthepatriot', ''),

(137506, ' @Denovo87\n\nSir jee. very good finds I must say. both articles speak high of the russian beast and no doubt it that the gun deserves the praise. both articles clearly establish that Viking is based on the military PYA YARGIN/GRACH model and GRACH is capable of firing 72N1 round however none of the articles say anything about Viking''s ability in this regard. again there is no conclusive/solid evidence that it can or it cannot.\n\nsecondly, one of the articles clearly states: [b]446 "Viking" means the civilian version[/b] if the qualification of the author is assumed to be flawless, if the credibility of the author is taken to be flawless then Baikal Viking is not a combat handgun and it is rightly said in the manual that it is a sporting/training pistol. \n\nanother interesting point: [b]"However, recall that the predecessor of the Viking had to operate with cartridges of high pressure, which I do not think has been overlooked in this latest version to bring strength and durability."[/b]\n\nit clearly establishes that GRACH has the ability to fire 72N1 round however leaves it to the speculation of the author regarding the capability of Viking with respect to firing 72N1. "I do not think" says the author. speculation or the author is merely expressing his personal opinion.\n\nsimilarly, in the other article the author says: [b]" MP 443 Grach pistol is high-capacity box of 17 rounds, made entirely from steel with a conventional DA / SA tripping action. He is capable to sustain the high operating pressures, which develops special ammunition caliber 9x19 7N21 high power breakdown, which is in official use in the Russian army"[/b]\n\nthe statement only suggest Grach''s ability to fire 7N21 round but says nothing about Viking''s ability in this matter.\n\nConclusion:\n\nrejecting baikal''s ability to fire 7N21 rounds is as difficult/easy as proving that it can fire the mystical and magical round commonly known as 7N21.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(137669, ' Basically the major difference between .22 and rest of three bores is that the only .22 is a rim fire cartridge and rest of three are center fire. 22 is a very old bore and it was designed for small game like squirrels, rabbits, crows and mostly for pest and rodent control. It is offered in Revolvers, Pistols and Rifles. You can get any of them on NPB licence.\n\nThe .222 aka the Triple Deuce/Triple Two/Treble Two is a centerfire rifle cartridge. It was first introduced for US Army as a small bore cartridge. It is although a PB in Pakistan.  \n\n\nThe .223 is a sporting cartridge with almost the same external dimensions as the 5.56x45mm NATO military cartridge. The name is pronounced either two-two-three or two-twenty-three. It is loaded with a 0.224-inch (5.7 mm) diameter, jacketed bullet, with weights ranging from 40 to 90 grains (2.6 to 5.8 g), though the most common loading by far is 55 grains (3.6 g). When loaded with a bullet that expands, tumbles, or fragments in tissue, this cartridge is capable of delivering devastating terminal performance, including remote wounding effects. It is a popular bore and if you can get a bolt action rifle and a licence, you can enjoy it, otherwise for other models, i.e. Auto/Semi Auto it is a PB.\n\n.244 is 6mm and it is also a center fire Cartridge and it was supposed to be a good deer cartridge but later on it was replaced by a very popular bore, i.e. .243 which can be delightful in shooting. Auto Models are considered PB and can not be used on any NPB license as well.', ''),

(137752, ' KA KHAN\n\nI could not agree more with you when you say a man without a heart can not shoot better with a better gun.\nWe are comparing men with similar or same abilities with different guns. What Mr Ahmad Sultan had mentioned was  that unless one has a  serious experience/background of competition shooting one does not know how different a Trap/Skeet gun is from a game gun. Only an auto shot gun of any reasonable make can let one score reasonably; yet  it grossly handicaps the shooter when he is up against the appropriate guns in the hands of other  competitors.\n The trap gun is at least a pound or more heavy, its action is very strong, the barrels are stiff  with a wide heat dispersing ventilated  wide rib. It also shoots from a foot to foot and a half higher than the point of aim, it has a single trigger  the second barrel is fired by an inertia cocked hammer and the trigger is extremely responsive with a very short lock time.\n The its trigger assembly can be changed /replaced in a very short time right on the range; as that is the time allowed as per rules to repair your gun.\nI have seen very expansive English game guns break apart as the pounding of trap shooting is hard, you are firing 2 shots in a second or so and do it a 150 times in one session. Both barrels are Full Choke\nOnly a dedicated Trap gun whether it is Turkish, Japanese, Russian or Italian will let you score well and will not break down in the middle of the match. \nOne can not win a car race no matter how good a driver you are unless you have a race car.', ''),

(137757, ' [quote=psychiatrist-1]There are four species of venomous snakes found in Pakistan: Common Krait, Scaled Viper, Russell’s Viper and Cobra. Almost all snake are warm blooded serpents. Therefore, snakes are unable to tolerate cold. However, in the month of September and early October, they are still out there. \n	Many bites are avoidable. Prevention is easy, wear your high boots or ask cobbler fix you high top boots. If that is not feasible, get the leather chaps or called legging. This is a just a piece of leather or any other suitable material 1 ft X 8 inches cylindrical shape open ends tight together either by Velcro or stitch pairs of small buckles. Wear it on your legs over your shoes. Do not place your hands in blind spots. Snakes are nocturnal. They hunt at night and most active in the evenings. watch out around the water ponds and under the bushes. Mornings are their rest time but can strike. For safety sake, never hunt alone and never hunt with a crowed either.\n	Now, if you are bit by a snake, remember, remain calm. Panic will increase your heart rate and snake venom will go through your blood circulation fast. Most of the bites are blanks. Snakes have tough time to inject venom. Bites are not a death sentence, most of the victims do survive. \n	Immediately, sit down, dangle you legs below the heart. Do not walk. Call for help immediately. If you have iced or cold pack place it directly over the snake bite. \n	You can place a torncate 6 inches above the bite. However, truncates are dangerous because, it will stop the blood reaching to the tissue, and you can loose your limb. Simple, truncate is just a small piece of rope or cloth.  To make a loop, tie the knot but leave 2-3 inches space between the skin and the rope. Slip  a small peace of a stick through the loop,  and start rotating the stick. As you rotate the stick, the torncate will tighten itself. Check the pulse below the strike. You should feel the bounding pulse, this is where you stop tightening the truncate. Take another peace of  rope tie the rope around the limb and then tie the one part of the stick to it. This will stop the truncate from unwinding. Now, you must unwind the torncate every 10-15 minutes then retighten. This is all you need until medical help arrives\n	Anti venom is called polyvalent and effective against all four species mentioned above. However, antivenin therapy is not for the novice. Leave this to the doctor. And I do n’t know if the Polyvalent anti snake venom is readily available in Pakistan? You can not keep in your first aid box because it needs refrigeration. \nNow, I like to hear from the expert in this matter.[/quote]\n\n\nExcellent notion ............................ Gr8', ''),

It is offered in Revolvers, Pistols and Rifles. You can get any of them on NPB licence.\n\nThe .222 aka the Triple Deuce/Triple Two/Treble Two is a centerfire rifle cartridge. It was first introduced for US Army as a small bore cartridge. It is although a PB in Pakistan.  \n\n\nThe .223 is a sporting cartridge with almost the same external dimensions as the 5.56x45mm NATO military cartridge. The name is pronounced either two-two-three or two-twenty-three. It is loaded with a 0.224-inch (5.7 mm) diameter, jacketed bullet, with weights ranging from 40 to 90 grains (2.6 to 5.8 g), though the most common loading by far is 55 grains (3.6 g). When loaded with a bullet that expands, tumbles, or fragments in tissue, this cartridge is capable of delivering devastating terminal performance, including remote wounding effects. It is a popular bore and if you can get a bolt action rifle and a licence, you can enjoy it, otherwise for other models, i.e. Auto/Semi Auto it is a PB.\n\n.244 is 6mm and it is also a center fire Cartridge and it was supposed to be a good deer cartridge but later on it was replaced by a very popular bore, i.e. .243 which can be delightful in shooting. Auto Models are considered PB and can not be used on any NPB license as well.[/quote]\nGood explanation', ''),

Lancer, another polymer mag maker, uses inlayed stainless steel feed lip on their polymer mag. \n\nThe mag body regardless of material and the spring will not be the problem.\n\nYevgeny Dragunov spent more time in design the magazine for for the SVD than the rifle itself. Most of the jamming in the M16 platform is not the rifle itself but its flimsy magazine that was originally designed to be disposable.', ''),
(137901, ' [quote=AK47]Unless for pulling the [b]SKIN[/b] off the Leopard, the animal has no other genuine value in hunting terms. As for the challenge of it, I still believe a similar challenge could be had in shooting some other fast animal, which would have a value else than the pure skin of it. I hope you understand.   :cool:[/quote] \n\nFirst, this is a hunting forum so I need not to justify any hunting here. Secondly, leopard is a member of big five and enjoys a unique value as an hunting trophy. Leopard hunting is like a game of chess you need to out think a very clever and cunning animal. Instead of usual hunting where you go to your query and stalk it, in Leopard hunting you bring the cat to where you are, this in itself is a great challenge. If you goof the shot and wound the Leopard rest assured that he will lie in the grass / bush waiting for you and will only charge when he is sure that he can nail you before you can even move a muscle. So make no mistake on the challenges that a leopard hunt involves.    \n\n[quote=AK47]In my opinion, animals being shot during a hunt, should either have a "consume-able" value, or should be shot if they''re damaging crops/endangering nearby lives, i.e Wild bores, etc.[/quote]\nThat is only one dimension of hunting. Hunting also serve as a conservation tool i.e. the money generated from trophy hunting is used for anti poaching effort and preservation of habitat for wild life. Without trophy hunting the wild animals will have no value for the local people who will indiscreetly kill animals for meat, cut the jungle for timber and destroy the wild habitat to make way for cultivation. Once the habitat is lost all the wildlife will be lost as well. \n\nSee what is happening to the Tiger in India, without any value it is struggling to survive out side the National Parks. Similar example in Kenya who banned hunting in the 80s now only 5% wildlife survive outside the National parks. \n\nThe success in enhancing its wildlife is South Africa, where 70% of its total wildlife is outside the National Park in private land. As farmers have found that there is a lot of money to be made by doing game farming as due to hunting there is value on game animals, which has encouraged the farmers to increase the wildlife population.      \n \n[quote=AK47]I somehow can''t approve shooting the Leopard[/quote]\nWho asked for your approval? :) \n\n[quote=AK47]yet we''re free to disagree.  :)[/quote]\nYes off course you are free.', ''),

There are other areas like Omay, Lemco and Save where you can get both but be prepared you will not get a 45" sable in any of these areas. If you are lucky 41 may be 42 but thats about it. However, the Leopard is  huge in all these areas.\n\nSecondly, you don''t approve canned hunting!! I am impressed as you are a hunter with ethics.

His family had a history with weapons, and I really thought he knew the basics. He didn''t.\n\nAfter firing the 1.st round, and still keeping a finger on the trigger, he moved the gun in my direction, and BANG! The bullet crossed me overhead, since he was holding it in some 45 degrees position! Thanks God, I wasn''t hit, the guy was standing there trembling and I moved to his side and quickly took the gun out of his hands.\n\nHis instant and stupid question was like this: "hey, don''t you have to [b]bolt the action[/b] before every fire?"  :o   :mad:   :D \n\nThat was back in 1985.

I''ve tried every single time, but I simply cannot help it. unfortunately, Indian movies have made a cliche out of this otherwise beautiful handgun. by this time, my fancy is back to its normal and un-tickled state.\n\nfor me, with PT92/99, the pleasure starts with foreplay and unfortunately never progresses beyond it. all foreplay and no ***, you can imagine the feeling  :( \n\nthe stages my feelings go through when I look at a PT92/99:  :P   :)   :mad:  :( \n\nRegards.', ''),

(138051, ' I will agree, if there is no legal and organized hunting there will be no animal left. \nUnfortunately in to days world an animal has to become a self sustaining resource otherwise it will vanquish.\nIt took almost 35 years for some of us to convince the beaurocracy and the game department to legalize hunting of Ibex both in Sindh and selected Northern areas, and Markhore in Balochistan and Northern areas. Only after little more than 10 years the mountain sides are sprawling with animals but only where legal hunting is allowed, all areas where hunting is not allowed there is hardly any animal, as local people kill them round the year for the pot, to feed their families and even small villages near the game areas have the source of meat as the Ibex. \nWhen they  get a large portion of the   $ 80,000/- ( Markhore permit ) to wards village/ community  development they stop poaching . Similarly for the Ibex we Pakistani hunters pay Rs 100,000/- for the permit and spend another 50, 000/- or more, for expanses in the remote areas where there is no means of lively hood. Later on the friends one makes with the locals keep coming to seek assistance for their sick or their kith and kin wanting a job or further education. A whole cycle of remote community assistance comes into play and the locals stop the round the year poaching of females animals and their cubs. They realise it is better to eat a goat rather than a game animal which is their life line in the wilderness.\nThe leopard is considered a vermin in areas where there is no trophy hunting, it is poisoned, trapped shot on sight to save live stock ( even in Pakistan ). Where the leopard brings in hunters for legal hunting the hunters are welcomed and the leopard preserved for the hunters so that  the money flows and the life cycle goes on as the animal has now become a self sustaining resource.', ''),

I believe as mentioned in above posts level one achieved here with basic skills. For advanced and expert level there are sponsors available to pay for the rest of expenses.  \n\nJust a quote that one of my friends who couldn''t buy a average gun ended up buying an old local made gun cut the barrel around 24" slightly factor bigger then 24". and then after some shooting he found the pattern is not good enough so he ended up heating the end red hot and then he clamped it in metal claws hopping that in this manner he will improve it. And believe me it worked for him and he beats all of the equipment we have with his range and shot patterns. One of his project included introducing the choke system to similar gun. Works great. \n\nI hope that i will not scare skeet shooting learners telling that choke used with negative value :) but do we need that all information for level one i guess not it comes with practice and experience.', ''),
(138174, ' AoA Everybody\n\nKindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject here. like all other sports, skeet is also a sport. only difference is that it employs a stick that goes bang when you pull the trigger and you cannot look down the business end cause your head might explode. other than that, its pretty much like any other sports out there.\n\nwith that I would suggest any newcomer to get any decent shotgun. even a desi pump action would do. only requirement for a newcomer in my humble opinion is decent enough patterns. get into this game and as your skill progresses, all things that are needed for you to become a world class skeeter will start coming to you. so don''t fret over the equipment, posture and other variables involved in this game.\n\nhow? well... as your skill develops, you''ll know the limitations of your technique (i''m assuming that its bad) and you''ll correct it or you''ll be forced to correct it. you''ll know the limitations of your posture. you''ll correct it too or you''ll be forced to correct it. either way, you''ll know what you have to do to boost your performance with the given level of assets (game assets, not financial) that you have.\n\nthen there is maturity, at this stage, your skill will start hitting its optimum (in other words STALLING) with the given level of your assets. also called high point. at this stage, your skill will demand a better assets. this is the time when you should progress to better equipment if you want your skill to grow any further. then its the never ending chase of skill vs equipment. however you should remember that your skill should be synchronized with your equipment. \n\nand....... when the time comes for you to compete, again, only your skill set can determine if you need better equipment or not.\n\nso......in the meantime, just get yourself a racket, any racket and get in the game. stop worrying about if its a right racket or not. let your skill answer that question for you.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(138195, ' [quote=PUNJTANI5]what will a decent fishing rod cost in pakistan rawalindi \nand where is it available[/quote]\nPUNJTANI5 brother, what type of fishing rod you need. Most common are the bait fishing rods. You can buy a reasonably good bait fishing rod in 700-1200 Rs. If you need a rod for lure fishing, you will have to look around as they are not readily available. Abdullah Fishing Center, located in basement just next to Saver Foods ahead of China Market area, has good collection of bait fishing and has few lure fishing rods as well. If you are looking for a fly fishing rod than it would be difficult to find one here. I get mine from USA or Malaysia. More importantly, the shop owner Mr Khalid Usmani is a keen angler himself and a very nice and upright person. Without doubt, he is the cheapest in Rawalpindi. The same stuff you would get in almost double the price elsewhere. Please go to him and he will give you the right things. \n\nGown House has few imported rods collection which are basically all marine fishing rods and not required for freshwater fishing. The prices are phenomenally high. The owner knows nothing about fishing and tries to impress the buyer with big brand names, without knowing the purpose of that equipment. \n\nGood luck.', ''),

Also told him that I am searching for the (used) O/U in good condition for skeet shooting, he immediately called his friend residing in U.K, told him about the mission. His friend donated a good amount and during Gup Shup he told him about my search for O/U, he ( the friend in U.K) than talked to me and told me that he has Browning O/U at his Lahore residence and asked me what amount I am willing to pay? With fear of rejection I offered my bid which in my view is almost half the value of that piece, he made a deal and asked me to contact his younger brother and after that what he said about the payment made me stunned. He said that the amount of this deal should also be added into the relief fund. After this I realized how selfish and mean I am? So I decided to postpone my ambition of Skeet shooting, doubled the amount and increase the goods ordered for the packing. So What I have bough today is a life jacket, a Gun case to save my skin and a ticket of endless joy of skeet shooting without the fear of limited ammo in heavens. How do you fare this bargain?

I''m sure, 5 will will outlive most of us [b]and[/b] the gun!  :)[/quote]\n\nBro, your idea sounds workable but it necessitates that we first have to establish the useful life of a fully topped off mag. I reckon, a fully topped off magazine would rapidly lose its spring tension causing failure to feed problems, specially in the event of critical (hostile) event. therefore your suggestion (in my humble opinion) only works if we exactly know for how long we can keep a magazine loaded to its max capacity without causing any ill effects.\n\neconomics also play a major part here. keeping three extra mags handy would be difficult and with available handgun options, the cost of three mags would roughly equate to quiet a bit of range practice which everybody suggests is very important. \n\ngiven a safe estimate of 5000 rupees per mag, we are looking at additional commitment of 15,000 rupees. with that kinda money, one can buy around 375 rounds of ammo @ 40 rupees a pop and get himself/herself acquainted with their gun on a range. that acquaintance can potentially save life/lives.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Please post a picture of the black panther if any[/quote]\nhi sir , as Sikindar and Ahmad bahi stated black panther in itself is not a species but rather a term given to black cubs or black cats of different types Black panthers are melanistic colour variants of several species of larger cat. Wild black panthers in Latin America are black jaguars (Panthera onca), in Asia and Africa black leopards (Panthera pardus), and in North America may be black jaguars or possibly black cougars (Puma concolor) (although this has not been proven to have a black variant), or smaller cats (wiki) , they come in same class as white lions , white tiger , and there are even myth about a white leopard or (albino PANTHER ) . though there is no live one in captivity but rare sighting have been seen and there is one in a museum (Natural History Museum at Tring uK).\nnow as of sighting i dont think so will be able to get you a picture , but if you believe in my word i have only seen twice a leopard prawling in abbottabad town , one was when it was captured roaming around a hilliy muhallah called Malik pura , and second time near FF center around 5 in the morning , people who are local to abbottabad will know what am talking about , both the times luckily i was able to see the captured animal and the ist one was light black with marking clearly visible in bright sub shine , but the second in was jet black , could coz there was no sun but then the wild life officials gave us little books from wwf explaining "black Panther" as we were  students at that time .\nand totaly agree with you about people telling stories about seeing a sher or a cheetah on hills , but the fact is that they call  the common leopard "sher" or "cheetah" and there is no point in correcting them as they wont listen .i have tried and tried to tell them that the only lion that exist in south Asia is the Asiatic lion which is now only present in tiny number in Gujrat india. \nthough interestingly there was a column in news some times ago about people seeing a tiger and a family cattle being attacked in mountains bordering  india near kashmir valley , where the local gave explanation that its not unusual for tiger to migrate here in mating season  or when disturbed . am not sure about the authenticity of the news but its is plausible .', ''),

Note that J.H. Greener and Albert Greener were two brothers of W W Greener and both brothers also made guns. Most J H Greener and a few Albert Greener guns are genuine.\nIn other cases, the maker would print "Greener" in bold gilt letters on the top rib and their own name in small characters, elsewhere on the gun. When one of these makers was challenged in Belgian courts, the defence advanced the theory that the weapons were using the Greener cross-bolt system and hence, the larger letters were intended to refer to the system, and not the maker of the weapon.\nDue to the large number of forgeries, the W.W.

The gas nut in question is being referred as:\n\n1. Traction control valve\n2. gas cylinder nut\n3. self regulating gas system\n4. gas system nut\n\nnow if you mean why its called self regulating gas system then I would say cause its self regulating within a given range. if you go beyond or below that range you''ll have to regulate it yourself. otherwise, within that range, the shotgun is supposed to work flawlessly provided that a proper break-in procedure has been followed by the user.\n\n[b]Kindly allow me quote the manual (Page 18 of EAA manual Baikal MP153)[/b]\n\n[quote]GAS SYSTEM ADJUSTMENT: The MP153 shotgun has a unique self-regulating\ngas system. It is preset at the factory to function with 12 Ga./2 3/4" (1 1/4 oz.) to\n12 Ga./3.5" (steel shot). This system also allows you to fine tune the function of\nthe shotgun with the gas system nut. By adjusting the gas system nut, you can\nmake your shotgun function over the complete range of 12 Ga. ammunition and\nset the shotgun for optimum function for the user. The gas system nut allows you\nto customize the function of the shotgun to your requirements without additional\nparts or kits (unlike our competition).[/quote]\n\nI hope it helps.\n\nRegards.', ''),

In tactical shooting where one is mostly hitting anywhere on a big target at rapid speed (and the bull, if there, is quite large too), one may shoot with both eyes open.  :)\n\nTo get an idea how much of difference shooting with dominant or non-dominant eye makes, please see following post which I have taken from competitive shooting thread; mind you I am left eye dominant with a right powerful hand. Recently, I changed my shooting hand so that I could shoot with my dominant eye  :) \n\n[quote=Gilani]After completing the ammo tests of 9mm ammo, for a change of taste decided to shoot my rifles. Just to check the difference, shot .22 rifle with both hands, ie, one string with the left hand (my new shooting hand) and one with the right hand (my ex shooting hand with which I have been shooting for over two decades). \n\n[b]My observations:[/b]\n\n-  With my right hand, I shoot quite comfortably and make a good group, but away from the point of aim. \n\n-  With my left hand, I face lot of problem in holding the rifle but the groups are dead in the center where I aim.\n\nPlease see the results and comment........................  :rolleyes:   \n\nFirer:......................Gilani\nRifle:.....................Steven Savage .22 LR Semi auto\nAmmo:....................Eley Match .22 LR (1967 lot)\n[b]Distance:................40 M[/b]\nTechnique:..............Deliberate Fire.

With the left hand, all in the bull and almost the same size of group. With the right hand, the group this time is a horizontal one, with only one bullet hitting 6 o''clock in the nine ring, which is my fault. The difference in the location of the group might have occurred because shooting position was different and perhaps the point of aim was also a little different. Cant understand the reason for making such a horizontal group. Must have been some problem in my technique. But one thing is for sure, with my non-dominant eye, I dont shoot where I aim whereas with my dominant eye, I shoot where I aim though there are problems in holding the rifle. \n\n[b]About the ammo, well, it was a very old lot. But surprisingly, there was only one misfire out of 60 bullets fired today and as you can see, the accuracy is also not bad.[/b] \n\n\n\nWith a .22 which has no recoil, I have adjusted my hold / technique and its ok now. [b]But today \nI also fired a big bore rifle with my left hand. On a strong recoil rifle, let me tell you its not really a pleasant experience to shoot with the non-shooting hand[/b]  :o \n\nHere are the results which are very ordinary, mainly because I found it very difficult to adjust with a full size heavy rifle and partly because the light was very poor. \n\nFirer:......................Gilani\nRifle:.....................

(138993, ' [quote=A.Abbas]Purpose of my question was to know the metal jacket material was that in most of desi rounds (I tested), are using steel (iron) metal jacket due to the lower cost as compare to copper alloys, the down side of this kind of metal jacket is that it causes more stress on barrel and create more heat and longterm use can damage barrel rifling and strength/life and accuracy is not in the business here anywhere.\n\nSecondly to push the harder material through the barrel, you need more KABOOM power and this higher KABOOM create a lot of stress on recoil system and frame as well and you can do the math.\n\nThirdly, with steel type jackets, manufacturers make the slugs under sized to pass through the barrel without much noticeable difference but it causes the lost of accuracy and the stress remains on the barrel.\n\nFourthly, with the steel metal jacket, color/paint are used to make it look like copper alloy, some this paint chips off in loading and some of it burns in the barrel and in the long term, lead to gun malfunction.\n\nFinally, lower quality rounds may cost you less for the moment but apart from accuracy, it causes some serious damages to the gun.

(139010, ' Detachable Rifle Barrels in Bolt Action is something, which never appealed me. Still heard so much from my fellow hunters regarding Blaser R8, I thought I should look into it.\n\nI saw few videos and read few gun reviews in favor of Blaser R8. Very accurate, fast straight pull action, detachable Barrels, magazine release tabs and so on………. I must say with its outlook it’s a beauty.\n\nGoing through videos and reviews in gun magazines I noticed that the detachable magazine and trigger is one peace. I personally think this feature is a big disadvantage.\n\nFor argument one can say Safety advantage at home from the kids or strict gun laws in Germany on the other hand it’s a possibility of losing a vital and expensive part of the rifle. This means that one cannot remove the magazine alone for easy reloading as company claims. If one loses the magazine, trigger will go with it as well.\n\nEven conventional rifles with detachable magazines with past experiences has improved the mechanism by adding a safety catch between trigger guard and magazine, so if by chance the magazine lock is disengaged it remain attached with the rifle.\n\nThe worst part in R8 is without a magazine NO TRIGGE TO PULL. One can''t even use it as single shot in case of emergency as one can do in conventional rifles with detachable magazines.\n\nWhen magazine is removed, the R8 automatically de-cocks the cocking slide cannot engage anymore even a cartridge still in the chamber. It’s bad enough to dropping a cartridge in the chamber out in the field, back of the jeep etc. Just imagine magazine in the mud along with the trigger as well.\n\nIts look like in R8 changing magazine process is slower than conventional magazine. One has to remove the plastic cover on the spare insert; also the empty /used insert has to be removed from the magazine. After changing them one has to put the cover on the used insert. \n\nIts look like a slightly high pressure in a Factory load round can cause case extraction problem due to straight pull. Not good for reloaded ammo because Re-loaders want optimum efficiency from their cartridges.\n\nOnly time can tell if R8 can match the reliability and durability of conventional bolt action, quite a few are Nearly 100 years old and still going strong withstanding all short of punishments of wars, hunting, reloading etc.\n\nIn my opinion one who desire to buy R8 as a general purpose rifle should be mentally prepared to buy replacement at exorbitant prices.\n\nMy observation are based on videos and reviews, I have not handled R8 personally. Members who has used or own R8 may disagree with me.', ''),

If their dominant eye is left and they use a right-hand configuration to shoot, they''ll still do a pretty good job. My problem is with switching your entire shooting configuration (From dominant right hand+ dominant Right side of the body to weaker left hand+weak left side of the body) for the sake of implied uberkool olympic-level skills (Which again is subjective, shouldn''t the change in skill level depend from person to person?). \n\nI''m no expert shooter, but the configuration that I''ve been using (Right handed - Left dominant eye) has worked for me. If my dominant eye is Left, and my dominant shooting stance, body and hand is right, then shouldn''t I make good use out of that configuration than mess up my natural instinct by switching to a side which has been relatively weak and non dominant all my life?  :/ \n\nAnyhoo, just my opinion Sir.

(139247, ' [b]While learning, it is important to learn the right techniques / methods.[/b] Quest for excellence in that particular field is altogether a different thing and would vary from person to person. However, knowing-fully well, it won''t be prudent to learn something that is not in order on the basis of this argument that the thing is working ok for me and I don''t have to become an Olympic shooter or grand prix driver or test cricket player etc. \n\n[b]Brother Anthrax has a point that if one is satisfied with just working shooting skills (which in view of that person are enough for SD situations etc) than it may not be worth an effort to change the shooting hand if one comes to know that his dominant eye and dominant hand are different. Off course, it will take lot of effort and practice.[/b] In this particular case therefore, that is a personal choice of that person. However, that particular shooter must know that by continuing from shooting with a different dominant hand and eye, he is always working on a handicap which may have consequences as explained by Skeeter sahib. \n\nI posted the target pics for purpose of sharing my experience on this particular issue as I have personally gone through this entire process of changing the shooting hand due to a different dominant eye and hand.[b] As you can see in the pics, eye is off course aligned with the sights and targets in both the cases, however, results are still different.[/b] [b]Even though I feel problems in holding a rifle in my left hand still my groups are dead in the center whereas with my right hand (which is my dominant hand), I feel very comfortable while shooting but the POI is away from the bull.[/b] Size of the groups from both hands is not drastically different but the POI is quite different. The size of group is perhaps similar due to the fact that for over two decades, I have shot with a different dominant hand and eye and have probably become efficient in doing a wrong thing the right way but still, shooting with same dominant hand and eye brings me better results than what I had practiced for over 20 years.  \n\n[b]Now, this was a fire from very short distance, hence the magnitude of error is very less. You take the same thing to 200 M and you would see a big difference in POI[/b] and as a shooter, I know that it would be very difficult to engage the target in first shot. In an instinctive fire, as explained by Skeeter sahib, the effect may be too much. \n\nAfter having said all this, I would still not force anyone to change his shooting hand if he happens to discover at a later stage that he has a different dominant eye. However, that person must know the effect that it will cause and should make his adjustments the way he deems appropriate. Just my two cents on the subject.  :)', ''),

It has a MV of [b]910 f/s[/b] with .22 pallets and 1250 f/s with .177 pallets.\n\nIn under-lever guns, [b]RWS 460 Magnum[/b] is the most powerful with a MV of [b]850 f/s[/b] for .22 and 1150 f/s for .17. \n\nIn side-lever [b]RWS 48, 52 & 54 (Air King)[/b] are quite powerful gun and have MV of [b]850 f/s[/b] for .22 and 1150 f/s for .17. RWS 54 Air King has a unique recoil mechanism due to which it is recoiless. However, the users opine that the same recoil system results in disturbing the scope zeroing at times because the receiver moves every time to absorb the recoil.\n\nAll RWS side-lever and under-lever air rifles are considered to be the most accurate of RWS air rifles due to their fix barrel. RWS 350 Magnum, though most powerful of all RWS air rifles, is known to have more jerk which effects accuracy. Its break-barrel mechanism also makes it less accurate as compared to side and under lever RWS rifles like RWS 48, 52, 54, 460 Mag etc.    \n\nHigh MV is actually just one factor and not a guarantee for terminal power and effectiveness when it comes to long range hunting / target shooting with air rifles. There are many air rifles which are advertised to have higher MV than RWS guns like Benjamin Super Streak (1100 f/s with .22 and 1500 f/s with .177) and Walther Falcon Hunter etc (1010 f/s with .22) however, these air rifles are known to perform nowhere close to RWS or Beemen air rifles which apparently have a much lower MV. Beemen R1, for example, has a MV of 765 f/s with .22 pallets but is considered as one of the most effective air rifles ever made with which people have been hunting rabits easily. The brute strength therefore does not guarantee maximum performance.', ''),

RWS 54 Air King has a unique recoil mechanism due to which it is recoiless. However, the users opine that the same recoil system results in disturbing the scope zeroing at times because the receiver moves every time to absorb the recoil.\n\nAll RWS side-lever and under-lever air rifles are considered to be the most accurate of RWS air rifles due to their fix barrel. RWS 350 Magnum, though most powerful of all RWS air rifles, is known to have more jerk which effects accuracy. Its break-barrel mechanism also makes it less accurate as compared to side and under lever RWS rifles like RWS 48, 52, 54, 460 Mag etc.    \n\nHigh MV is actually just one factor and not a guarantee for terminal power and effectiveness when it comes to long range hunting / target shooting with air rifles. There are many air rifles which are advertised to have higher MV than RWS guns like Benjamin Super Streak (1100 f/s with .22 and 1500 f/s with .177) and Walther Falcon Hunter etc (1010 f/s with .22) however, these air rifles are known to perform nowhere close to RWS or Beemen air rifles which apparently have a much lower MV. Beemen R1, for example, has a MV of 765 f/s with .22 pallets but is considered as one of the most effective air rifles ever made with which people have been hunting rabits easily.

(139397, ' Let me first say that though one places a premium on life, it is important to protect property as well, if simply to just send a message to the would be intruders/attackers. How do I mean? For example you do discover a theft in progress and you are sure that there is no threat to life, proceeding forthwith you allow the theft to continue and the intruder leaves. No harm, no fault, right? Wrong! Whoever just stole from you has just gotten away, and his dirty rotten morale is at an high. In fact he may be emboldened enough to consider a second swipe and maybe bring his friends along for the ride as well. So it’s best to deter a peaceful, opportunistic thief as well. Having said that, here are my two cents!\n\nIf a solitary individual has entered your premises, odds are opportunistic gains are in play, and chances are if they are unable to find something they may leave. In this case you can fire off a couple of warning shots to help him make that decision earlier, rather than later. However if the intruder has come with some pre-meditated designs then he is not leaving without taking something and has the intent to engage in actions that may be perceived as threatening to life or property. You may fire warning shots to determine their intentions. If after the shots his attempts do not decease then you have a fight on your hands and you may fire away in accordance with your aim and the accuracy of your gun. The warning shots are your legal defense.\n\nIn another scenario if two or more people have entered your house, then start shooting immediately. Odds are they are there for gains and not picnicking. And as it is well known that your private property is neither a park nor a picnic ground, you may proceed to shoot. Even if one goes down and the rest flee you have done your job and the Police can find the rest, trust me they can in over 90% of cases, also please note that these kind of incidences most always have an insider.\n\nAlso this nonsense of getting arrested afterwards is of no concern, especially as it’s one’s duty to protect one’s family and property. Getting arrested and going to jail should be second to protecting what’s yours. So as far as shooting someone goes it depends on your perception of threat and the intention you have at the time of shooting someone. Yes intention is very important as well because Allah is always there. You may be able to convince the authorities that you fired in self defense and you were not just trying your gun out at the first opportunity, and you may convince yourself as well, but Allah is always there.\n\nHaving said that I would shoot someone to prevent an assault on a neighbor or even a stranger.', ''),
(139398, ' a very interesting discussion.\nGame guns can be used effectively for skeet shooting for fun not a whole match or competition; unless these are Over and Under with single trigger and on the plus side of 7 pounds. \nHigh ribs when used in isolation will lower POI as 12 Gauge pointed out. The high ribs are used in  Double Trap, along with a very high comb, the high comb results in a High POI. The Guns for Skeet, Trap and Double trap are canted towards the direction of flight by the shooter; this helps keeping the clay insight while chasing it and also imparting lead .\nWell this is one way modifications and different techniques are followed by different shooters. How ever, a gun with a High Rib must also have a High Comb adjusted to give proper POI. \nI think we now agree game guns are different from competition guns', ''),

(139496, ' @ Apalo,\nBrother this is for pistol shooting and to check if your sights are aligned i suggest using a fore end support.\nPlace it on a hard stable surface with a few heavy books underneath the front part where the stock meets the barrel, do not put support under the barrel just the stock.\nNow aim it and fire this would tell you if your sights are out or your shooting is.\nAnd if your sights are aligned then if you are right handed i think you are lowering your barrel as soon as you press the trigger, And the pellet is misplaced because your point of aim changes as soon as the trigger is pulled and the pellet is still in the Barrel...\n\nThis is from what little I know of shooting maybe expert members will be of more help.\n\nRegards', ''),
(139497, ' wow, most of you shoot quite a lot; far more than what I do.  :)  But surprisingly, I don''t see many target results in the Competition shooting thread. Perhaps not many people fire on paper targets!!\n\nI mostly fire 9mm and .22LR. Occasionally, I do fire 7.62x54R, 7.62x51 for long range rifle and 12guage for skeet shooting. The number varies from 100-300 rounds a month, at an average. \n\nHere I would like to mention that too much shooting does not guarantee corresponding enhancement in standards, unless one is doing it the proper way. Shooting on a paper target is a must and a shooter must carry out analysis of each string that he fires. Poofing off ammo does not help much and is certainly very heavy on the pocket as well as the gun. Therefore, I believe in consistent shooting practices without a break, though the ammo fired during those practices may be less. Each target should be recorded and analysed for identifying faults and making further improvement.  \n\nI have seen many friends of mine doing aerial firing or shooting guns aimlessly in the rapid fire mode thus poofing off lot of ammo but not gaining much out of it. For me, shooting just 20-40 rounds (fired in strings of 5 with break in each string) are enough for a week, if done properly on a paper target and consistently, without long breaks. More than 60 rounds in one session is generally not advisable for an armature shooter because most people tend to loose concentration after this and remaining fire is just wastage of ammo. This however may vary from person to person   :)', ''),
(139498, ' Nice collevtion bro impersing', ''),
(139502, ' Apalo brother, most of the errors in shooting (rifle and handgun) are because of bad trigger control, not focusing properly on front site and bad breathing control. \n\nYou may like to follow the steps given below to find out the problem;\n\n-  As advised by Rasal.Saleh, shoot your airgun with your arms properly resting on something which does not move / shake. This would eliminate the error caused by shaking / trembling of the gun. Shoot a string of 5 pallets and see the group. \n\n-  If the group is good and making a clear pattern (say 2-3 inches from 25 M) but is away from your point of aim than your air gun needs to be zeroed. Adjust the sights accordingly. \n\n-  If their is no group and pallets are all over the place than your shooting technique needs to be seen. Please make sure that you align your eye, sights and the target and than focus on front site, breath out and keep your body static and press the trigger slowly but firmly, achieving a surprise break. \n\n-  If you are shooting generally in the area where you are aiming (ie, bull) but few pallets are hitting down than you are most probably flinching. Follow the tips given above, specially trigger control. \n\n-  If you are shooting few pallets over the bull than you are anticipating recoil. Improve your concentration and just focus on front site and trigger control. \n\n-  If your group is vertical, you need to check your breathing. \n\n-  If your group is horizontal, you need to check your finger on the trigger. Either it is too much or too less of finger and you are changing it frequently. Keep the distal pad of your shooting finger on the trigger during all the shots fired. \n\n-  Dont change the aim while firing a string. Let the pallets / bullets hit wherever they do and apply correction / adjustment after you have shot a string. \n\nThere could be many more reasons but these are some of the common faults committed by most of us. Hope it helps  :)', ''),

The WD40 is a bit too greasy, I feel, I''d stick to Brunox, and after several sessions, swab a few times with Hoppes copper solvent, and end with a few swabs of Brunox. For lubricating moving parts, best is Hoppes oil again. Best thing with boresnake or OTIS vs traditional cleaning is that you clean in the direction of the rifling, out of the muzzle, and dirt/solvent with dirt does not move from the barrel towards the receiver side or firing pin area, as it would, when cleaning traditionally from barrel end/muzzle and inwards.', ''),

In the first string, I aimed at the bull and observed a bullet drop of 3-4 inches; you can see the bullets hitting at 6 o''clock. My rifle normally shoots a little on the right for which I had already compensated by aiming a little on the left. In the next 3 strings, I aimed at 11 o''clock in 5 ring area ([b]the aiming point has been shown with a + mark in green colour. This was drawn before taking the pics for your understanding. During shooting, I aimed at an imaginary point at 11 0''clock.[/b]) The result after this change of aim was better and I was able to hit 9 out of remaining 15 bullets in the bull, 8 of them making a nice group of 0.9 inches. 5 of these 8 bullets were fired in third string. There were a few fliers though which show lack of concentration and perhaps aiming at an imaginary point which was not marked on the target. BTW, from 100 M, the black area on the target is completely covered behind the front site and aiming is actually an estimate. \n\nOn my next session, I will take a hammer along and adjust the front site of my rifle for windage. Hopefully, I would be able to hit more in the bull by aiming at 12 o''clock in that case.\n\nWanted to have 50 and 100 M shoots from my handgun but paucity of time did not allow it. May be next time  :)\n\nSkeeter60 sahib, Sir any tips for shooting .22 LR rifle at 100 M with open sights??  From 100 M with a .22, should I shoot at 25 M precision target or 25 M rapid fire target.

(139879, ' I am truly cross-dominant.  I am right handed, but my left eye is dominant.  I have not been able to train myself to shoot a handgun with both eyes open.  I simple shoot with my left (dominant) eye closed.  This does not prevent me from being both very accurate and very fast.  \n\nI qualified expert with the M-16 in the US Army.  I can shoot iron-sight bolt action rifle and scoped bolt action rifle.  I have never shot skeet, so I can not offer an opinion on dominance with that weapon system and use.  I defer to more experience persons.\n\nI submit for consideration that Brian Enos, a true top in the world shooter was also cross-dominant.  He also closed his left (dominant eye) and simply shot with his non-dominant eye.   It did not prevent him from being one of the most accurate and fastest handgun shooters in the world.\n\nAddressing the concept of field of view and handgun shooting and "tactical" situations.  The handgun is used defensively at very close distances in closed environments MOST of the times.  Clear, sharp near perfect sight pictures are not used in those situations.  Frequently the shooter is placing his hands and gun over the threat and shooting quickly.  If the shooter''s fundamentals are sound, he hits the target well.  Both his eyes are open and it doesn''t matter because he is not seeing anything close to a sight picture which matters.  He sees a black or silver rear of his gun over the target.\n\nRifle shooting at distance is far different.  The shooter has the time to go prone, or find support.  He has the time to find a sight picture with one eye closed with iron sights, and properly press the trigger.  Accuracy is more important in these situations.\n\nThe advent of the optical sights (EOTECH) changed everything (for the better).  The shooter uses a rifle more like a handgun.  I have not had a problem with cross dominance when using these hollowgraphic devices.  One shoots these sight systems with both eyes open.  The glowign red dot or crosshairs draws my brains attention and cancels the dominance.  This has been my experience.\n\nMy opinion is that eye dominance matters little for handgun shooting.  At close distances with fast shooting the shooter can keep both eyes open and not incur penalty.  When the distance increases most people seem to naturally close the non-shooting eye and use only the shooting eye (be it dominant or not) and be quite accurate.  If it''s the only eye open, it doesn''t matter if it''s dominant or not.', ''),

(139881, ' Gilani said it true.  To carry on from that point.\n\nToo many shooters are overly concerned with a perfect sight picture.  90% of accurate shooting is trigger control.   The problem lies in that as visual creatures we understand a perfect sight picture easily.  We can so naturally see that the sights are not perfect.  But, most people can''t hold a perfect sight picture.  I can''t and I have years and tens of thousands of rounds fired.  Maybe over 100,000.  \n\nTrigger manipulation and is not natural.  Many people don''t appreciate the dexterity required for proper trigger control.\n\nAs a result they under-emphasize the most important (trigger control) and over-emphasize the sight picture.  The leads to the biggest issue- jerking the trigger.  They see a near perfect sight picture and attempt to make the gun go bang right then.  They press suddenly on the trigger and DESTROY that near perfect sight picture.  They jerk on of trigger forcing the front of the gun down and to the left for the typical right-handed shooter.\n\nAlmost all of my student instinctly hold their breath.  It takes no effort to educated them to take a full breath and let out air until they loose tention and they fell "comfortable."\n\nIf you want to improve your shooting, the next time you are practicing remove almost all expectations regarding the sights and shoot with all focus on the trigger.  Just have the front sight in the notch of the rear sight.  Don''t worry much about it.  But worry about the trigger.  I bet dollars to donuts your group size shrinks and any tendancy to shoot low and left goes away.  But only if you worry, only if you concern yourself, only if you put your attention to the trigger and not the sight picture.  The sight will wobble, don''t concern yourself with that.  Concern yourself with the trigger manipulation.\n\nAND SLOW IT DOWN.  Most people just don''t get how slow they have to start on the trigger.  For some I have to tell them, slow, slower, slower still, even slower than that.  So slow it feels painful and silly and maybe even wrong.  But, that is because they don''t "get" proper trigger control.  They think they can just pull the trigger back and it means nothing to the shooting solution.', ''),

So, [b]if you want the mags to last the longest... never use[/b] them.  :o    :lol: \n[/quote]\n\nAny good quality spring will not loose its tensile power for years while kept compressed or uncompressed, every spring regardless of good or bad have the tendency to break (from first few cycles to many years). Only unevenly tempered (heat treated) sprigs will loose its tensile power or you may call its effective length within few cycles.\n\nNow let me try to explain the wear out phenomena, almost all of us have experienced by themselves or have seen some one some time, breaking metal pieces (when tools were not readily available for the job or too lazy to get them), by constantly twisting the metal piece/wire in opposite directions (if you experienced to touch it, you feel it warm/ hot) finally breaking it. If you didn''t experienced this thing, just take a piece of wire or metal sheet, start twisting/bending it opposite direction until it break.\n\nWhat happens when you twist the metal in opposite direction constantly\nBy twisting/bending in opposite direction, we are actually generating heat by stretching and compressing the metal simultaneously at one point on opposite sides, heat makes metal harder and hardness makes metal brittle.\n\nHere is a practical experiment every one of you can do to know the effects of uneven/irregular heat treatment (temper),  take two springs (any metal spring, any size), make these red hot on the fire, put one in the water while it is red hot, let the other cool in room temperature, press or stretch both these springs one by one, you ''ll see, the spring cooled in room temperature fully compressed or stretched like it is no more than a metal wire, the instantly cooled one will break apart like glass instead of metal. This experiment will well explain the effect of uneven/irregular heat treatment.\n\nA well made, well treated spring will not lose its tensile power/length until it breaks apart by continuous usage or eaten out by rust, helical and spiral spring can take more beating than leaf spring.\n\nAnd in the end of this lengthy typing after a long time, if you don''t want your imported (walati) mag spring to be damaged simply don''t use it and a desi handgun mag spring costs around RS. 80 to100/= (depending single or double stack).', ''),

The gun and the spare mag were wrapped in a shopping bag and taped allowing no air to to go inside. Last year while cleaning up the store, he opened that suitcase, brought out the gun, no rust whtsoever. took it outside and let a rip. All the rounds fired flawlessly. Yes i do agree if the point is storing a gun for a long period, then there is absolutely no need to leave it loaded, but in a good weapon, it wont harm the springs.

My knowledge about the magazines is much different from the practicle experience of some of our esteemed members. I am a beleiver of the fear (myth or reality) that mag spring do wear out if kept under continous compression for longer periods. At the same time ammo kept under continous pressure may also get deshaped. Following is the base of my beleif.\nNo matter what make a gun may be all its parts have life span. Like barrel 25k, slide 40k, slide spring 30k etc. Why on earth a mag spring will have an unlimited compression life span?[/quote]\n\nAlthough all the main parts of a gun has limitted life span, some more some less but springs have the longest life span than all of them, IMHO.\nRegarding the compression on spring, if you remove the spring from mag you will see its under compression all the time no matter its loaded with rounds are not, if you see a spring out of box it will almost be double the mag size. \nMag springs (of the reasonably manufactured pistols) are always made to be compressed 24/7. \nSo always keep your HD/SD mags full without being scared of these getting loose, [b]you always can get a new spring or mag but not a lost life[/b].[/quote]', ''),

(139955, ' I COMMANDED A TANK SQUADRON IN ZARB-E-MOMIN\n\nMy hands were feeling numb less from the cold of desert night, and more from fear of what may happen in next half an hour. Unfortunately the moonlight spread over desert sand was making it nigh impossible to identify khaki clad human figures. I therefore relied more over picking up movement rather than recognizing men. Looking through the green haze of night vision goggles, I was trying to make out any human or animal form capable of upright locomotion. Over crackling of wireless static, could be heard muffled exchanges between the Brigade Headquarter signaler and my operator exchanging latest information about the enemy commando raiding party. Apparently they had been heli dropped behind our positions just after dusk and from there they proceeded to raid the infantry brigade headquarters. Having played havoc with a well entrenched headquarters defended by an infantry company, the raiding party was reportedly following a desert track on their way to the pickup point for ex-filtration. The problem was that my small squadron headquarters was deployed just 6 kilometers away on the same track. With two tanks, an armoured recovery vehicle (ARV), a jeep and a dozer, I did not have enough manpower to grapple with even half a platoon of infantry what to talk of a commando raiding party of Blueland. \nDuring winters of 89/90, the biggest exercise in history of Pak Army by the name of Zarb-e-Momin took place in Thall desert. A number of armoured/infantry divisions, and other mechanized troops participated. Probyn’s Horse was split up within two enemy infantry divisions playing as Foxland. Bravo Squadron equipped with M47 tanks fell to the lot of one of these to depict its integral Armour Regiment. On its side, the scenario included attack across Chenab river by Blue land’s forces, against which the Bravo was pitched not only to counter attack the Bridgehead made by the enemy, but also later on to spread over the length and breadth of desert to oppose the advancing enemy. As a very green squadron commander, the task seemed fairly simple while receiving orders in the Divisional Headquarters on the large scale map. It however proved to be horrendous when 14 tanks of the squadron were actually spread over 35 kilometers of regimental frontage. The prospects of physical encounter were made daunting due to the real war like coverage given to daily battle score on the national media in which not only the names of personnel becoming prisoners were cited but also their units and the circumstances were read out as per information provided by the winner side of each clash.\nThe first information came in with the sudden bursts of star shells from the direction of raid and followed by almost hysterical pleas for help meant more as warning to others over the brigade command net. At that time most of troops had slipped under warm blankets in the security of their respective vehicles brought closer together for the night, and only the night sentries and the duty operator were awake. On hearing this I immediately called my war council of 13 all ranks, and immediately launched into intricate business of war planning. First to be discarded was the proposal to use live ammunition against the approaching enemy, less from any benevolence on our part, but more because of fear of similar retaliation from them. Next I vetoed a suggestion to immediately shift our position away from harm’s way, primarily out of fear that it may somehow be contorted into a tale of abandoning of our positions considered anathema to any self respecting aspirant of future military laurels. Then Lance Dafedar Sher Ali further stiffened our resolve by reminding us of the recent abduction of one of our tank crews of second troop by the enemy a week earlier. Sowar Ilam Din was going towards the troop leader’s tank after Maghreb one evening, when he was ambushed by the enemy raiding party enroute and taken away as prisoner of war. No explanation of lack of resources, or unfairness of exercise constraints was allowed to be aired on the media, and consequently a considerable dent had already been made in martial history of Bravo squadron. Then suddenly Naib Risaldar Ashraf came up with the idea of turning the tables on the enemy and instead of allowing ourselves to be raided, he suggested that we should set up an ambush for them. I immediately took over from there as the squadron commander, and quickly came up with three major advantages of this plan exactly in line with teachings of Staff College. Firstly, we could rely on our night vision capable armoured fighting vehicles to be able to spot the incoming enemy earlier, and secondly through our mobility we were in a better position to chase and scare away the enemy in featureless desert terrain. And finally by remaining mounted, none of us ran the risk of being caught. The plan was to deploy astride the track facing the approaching enemy with our two tanks inner most, while our flanks were being secured by the indomitable ARV and the jeep. All the wireless sets were to remain on, and drivers ready to start their vehicles and charge at the enemy with head lights blazing on my word of command. Infra red lights were switched on and a constant scan of the area ensued in earnest. Now, I was feeling a bit comfortable of our superior position and age old clichés like ‘forewarned is being forearmed’ etc were buzzing through my mind. I suddenly realized what must have passed through the minds of various captains of war while making final round of their battle arrayed steeds prior to the clash of steel in the past. Well, this was going to be our moment of glory and to boot, an opportunity to dispel any bad patch recently encountered in war history of mighty Bravo. \nSudden chill evaporated any thoughts of grandeur from my mind when my operator quietly said, “here they come”. I immediately made a Charlie Charlie call on the squadron command net and informed all about the approach of coming enemy and the need to be ready for action. In my enthusiasm, I totally forgot that there were other troops of the squadron also on the same net and they were not aware of our predicament. Consequently all hell broke loose on the wireless net, which suddenly came alive with frantic calls of confused signalers and commanders all wanting to know what was happening. Condemning all chaos to the fog of war that I had earlier heard about from my seniours, I tried to concentrate on immediate battle. There were about 25 to 30 enemy individuals and about 8-9 prisoners from our brigade, loosly spread along the track walking towards us in total oblivion to what was going to befall them shortly. In fact I overheard one of them taunting the prisoners with cowardice and lack of professionalism. This was too much to bear for my young and energetic mind, and so I suddenly shouted on the wireless, “Allah o Akbar”. All the heavy diesels suddenly came alive with loud thrumming sound and the moonlit night was set ablaze in powerful beams of white light. There was a look of bewilderment on the faces of enemy troops before we charged on them. Thereafter ensued one of the most exhilarating chase of my life, when I finally managed to prove the ascendancy of tank over hapless infantry even if it was of the commando kind. Each fighting vehicle had a group of 7-8 individuals running in front in zig zag with their arms raised above and shouts of surrender on their tongues. Now the fear had given way to real enjoyment and all the vehicle commanders seriously tried to run down crazily running figures in front. The fun lasted for a short while only, and after the enemy realized that by scattering into single individuals instead of bunching up, they could dodge few of the chasing vehicles. And in this way they managed to melt away into the depths of desert and probably decided to ex-filtrate on foot instead of keeping up with their helicopter pickup point. The best part however was that they had left behind all the loot as well as the prisoners, which we gathered together and made comfortable within our humble resources. The next morning of course saw the retrieval of pride of a humbled brigade headquarters by a hand full of tank corps troops. I heard with an inward smile recounting of the last night’s tale in a thousand different shades depending upon who was the narrator and therefore the natural hero. Long live Bravo Squadron and long live Probyn’s Horse.', ''),

Ask anybody to sit directly under the barrel and move that spot vertically up like rising clay but maintain its alignment with the gun''s muzzle.\n\n3.Now looking straight in your peripheral vision you have to find the spot very quickly and before it reaches the muzzle dryfire the gun.\n\n4.Now do it again with gun fully mounted and cheek bone pressed against comb.\n\n5. Now repeat the process with CANTED gun,so as you are allowing a window for the spot to see it quickly.\n\n  Anybody doing it with precision will come to know" HOW THE HIGHER COMBS and RIBS HELP IN SEEING THE FIRST CLAY SO EARLY" in DOUBLE TRAP only.\n\n Moreover all the first shots on DT are taken with 1l2 chokes and second by 3l4 chokes,because targets fall at 55-mtrs from TRAPS.In olympic Trap the target falls at a distance of 75-76 mtrs and therefore full chokes are used.[/quote]\n\n@Mian sb, I am planning to build a high rib from balsa wood for my gun and see how it works with raised stock.', ''),

(140083, ' [quote=StevenCline]Gilani said it true.  To carry on from that point.\n\nToo many shooters are overly concerned with a perfect sight picture.  90% of accurate shooting is trigger control.   The problem lies in that as visual creatures we understand a perfect sight picture easily.  We can so naturally see that the sights are not perfect.  But, most people can''t hold a perfect sight picture.  I can''t and I have years and tens of thousands of rounds fired.  Maybe over 100,000.  \n\nTrigger manipulation and is not natural.  Many people don''t appreciate the dexterity required for proper trigger control.\n\nAs a result they under-emphasize the most important (trigger control) and over-emphasize the sight picture.  The leads to the biggest issue- jerking the trigger.  They see a near perfect sight picture and attempt to make the gun go bang right then.  They press suddenly on the trigger and DESTROY that near perfect sight picture.  They jerk on of trigger forcing the front of the gun down and to the left for the typical right-handed shooter.\n\nAlmost all of my student instinctly hold their breath.  It takes no effort to educated them to take a full breath and let out air until they loose tention and they fell "comfortable."\n\nIf you want to improve your shooting, the next time you are practicing remove almost all expectations regarding the sights and shoot with all focus on the trigger.  Just have the front sight in the notch of the rear sight.  Don''t worry much about it.  But worry about the trigger.  I bet dollars to donuts your group size shrinks and any tendancy to shoot low and left goes away.  But only if you worry, only if you concern yourself, only if you put your attention to the trigger and not the sight picture.  The sight will wobble, don''t concern yourself with that.  Concern yourself with the trigger manipulation.\n\nAND SLOW IT DOWN.  Most people just don''t get how slow they have to start on the trigger.  For some I have to tell them, slow, slower, slower still, even slower than that.  So slow it feels painful and silly and maybe even wrong.  But, that is because they don''t "get" proper trigger control.  They think they can just pull the trigger back and it means nothing to the shooting solution.[/quote]\nExcellent input. This is what I have also been stressing upon. I believe if one has good trigger control, that shooter will never be below 80%, even if he just roughly aims in the center of the target. And if the trigger control is not good, one would always be unpredictable no matter how hard he stresses on other aspects of good shooting. Why?? it has been explained in detail by Steve Cline in the post quoted above  :)', ''),

"Before you tell me, I''d like you to pass a little test.

"So you don''t really know if it''s true or not. Now let''s try the second test, the test of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my student something good?"\n\n"No, on the contrary..."\n\n"So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him even though you''re not certain it''s true?"\n\nThe man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, "You may still pass though because there is a third test - the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my student going to be useful to me?"\n\n"No, not really..."\n\n"Well," concluded Socrates, "if what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me at all?"\n\nThe man was defeated and ashamed and said no more.\n\nThis is the reason Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.', ''),

Or, the air rilfle has a low velocity.  In either case, adjust the sights.  If you can''t adjust the sights as you state above, simply aim the same distance above the target as you are hitting low.  Maybe draw a second target to aim at which should bring the pellet holes up onto the real bulls-eye.\n\nYou could consider filing off some of the top of the front sight.  This would bring the front of the gun up to bring the point of impact up.\n\nOr, you just accept the hits low and go on with life and focus on tight groups. \n\nWere you at all wobbly?\n[b] sorry cant get you[/b][/quote]\n\nWobbly - means shakey; did you observe a lot of movement in the sights, were you unsteady?\n\nWe have failed to consider one more thing- it could be the air-rifle.

Secondly the simple procedure for moi was Rs ------- given a dealer , nic copy , 2 photographs  and thats it . What better way could one get an MOI . In my personal opinion the procedure for MOi has been deliberately made to benefit dealers , and the middleman . If a a person wants to make an MOI legally , How do you expect someone from karachi or gawadar to go to islamabad  and stay their for at least 1 month and get a license . YOU guys do maths . \n\nAs far as the sindh license is concerned  they are being issued from 2 quotas . 1 home minister quota( unlimited )  2 home secretary quota (200 per month ). Now all of them are being issued after police verification from your respective police station . Their may some loopholes in getting a police clearance certificate but that police noc is a document that can save your license from being cancelled .\n\nregards', ''),

Either you pay the middle man or if you dare try to make it yourself, it ends up to be a major hassale. Have experienced it myself , although I was reffered to a relevent officer in the MOI , but it still took me two months. \n\nAs for provincial license, police verification, my understanding is this process also invites middlemen. Most people would rather pay a guy to get things done rather then taking the hassale and following up. But I guess that is part and parcel of our culture. \n\nBtw I fail to understand, members living in Sind all want to get a MOI license made.

I however would add one more thing about R8 that one has to mount a scope for every barrel as scope is mounted on barrel and not on the receiver,which in turn would cost more bucks  and require more time to get started with that barrel.\n\nI however would appreciate the idea of Modular design i.e. interchangeable caliber repeating rifles. This idea however was initially introduced half a century ago by TC-Thompson/Center when they produced their single shot break open multi caliber guns. Although to the vast majority of hunters, a single shot is still, well, just a single shot.\n\nBlaser is not the only modular rifle manufacturers. I have recently read a review on another rifle made by Sauer and it was their model 202 and I quote " Key elements of the Sauer 202 combine a quick-change barrel system, a short, 60-degree bolt throw, an ingenious silent safety and a DETACHABLE BOX MAGAZINE".\n\nSo I guess Sauer gets more points as far as SAFETY and MAGAZINE detachment is concerned plus one more point to Sauer for its verstality with one scope.\n\nI have not yet used either of above two rifles and whatever I have written is based on my readings.\n\nRegards.', ''),

It changed all the minds of gunsmiths who believed in glass-bedding  and pillar bedding in other bolt action rifles. \n\nThoughts, if i get 1 inch groups at 100 yards with any other rifle why should i pay more :)\nseen the rifle ///,... compact and very effective on quick mount.[/quote]\nsir do you mean blaser R93 ? never heard of blaser R3 nor seen any at the shooting range ! though i do agree with many points which shano bro made but i would add , that one who own a Blazer R8 will rarely lose such a important part of that gun and second i seriously doubt that any Blazer R8 owner will ever be in need to use a single shot in case of emergency they would probably have another weapon for that . the logic is right here but the reason dictates other wise , \nand as of you last point .. a Toyota will take one  any where in the world , then why should one own a Mercedes ?', ''),
(140647, ' [quote=Shano Shah]Detachable Rifle Barrels in Bolt Action is something, which never appealed me. Still heard so much from my fellow hunters regarding Blaser R8, I thought I should look into it.\n\nI saw few videos and read few gun reviews in favor of Blaser R8. Very accurate, fast straight pull action, detachable Barrels, magazine release tabs and so on………. I must say with its outlook it’s a beauty.\n\nGoing through videos and reviews in gun magazines I noticed that the detachable magazine and trigger is one peace. I personally think this feature is a big disadvantage.\n\nFor argument one can say Safety advantage at home from the kids or strict gun laws in Germany on the other hand it’s a possibility of losing a vital and expensive part of the rifle. This means that one cannot remove the magazine alone for easy reloading as company claims. If one loses the magazine, trigger will go with it as well.\n\nEven conventional rifles with detachable magazines with past experiences has improved the mechanism by adding a safety catch between trigger guard and magazine, so if by chance the magazine lock is disengaged it remain attached with the rifle.\n\nThe worst part in R8 is without a magazine NO TRIGGE TO PULL. One can''t even use it as single shot in case of emergency as one can do in conventional rifles with detachable magazines.\n\nWhen magazine is removed, the R8 automatically de-cocks the cocking slide cannot engage anymore even a cartridge still in the chamber. It’s bad enough to dropping a cartridge in the chamber out in the field, back of the jeep etc. Just imagine magazine in the mud along with the trigger as well.\n\nIts look like in R8 changing magazine process is slower than conventional magazine. One has to remove the plastic cover on the spare insert; also the empty /used insert has to be removed from the magazine. After changing them one has to put the cover on the used insert. \n\nIts look like a slightly high pressure in a Factory load round can cause case extraction problem due to straight pull. Not good for reloaded ammo because Re-loaders want optimum efficiency from their cartridges.\n\nOnly time can tell if R8 can match the reliability and durability of conventional bolt action, quite a few are Nearly 100 years old and still going strong withstanding all short of punishments of wars, hunting, reloading etc.\n\nIn my opinion one who desire to buy R8 as a general purpose rifle should be mentally prepared to buy replacement at exorbitant prices.\n\nMy observation are based on videos and reviews, I have not handled R8 personally. Members who has used or own R8 may disagree with me.[/quote]\nbrother i have not fired a R8 but have once tried a R93 and a close friend of mine owns a R8 ..all i would say is i totaly agree with what you said , but once you have fired these beauties , these observations wont even cross your mind for a second . \nthough i must say , you have a eye of a eagle , very informative post .', ''),

Now not all species of duck or geese follow the same route ... like there are two routes for duck entering in Pakistan one is North and they follow the river Indus till they reach Sea second is west through river Kabul and then follow river Indus. some of the birds remain on track till they reach their destination and some settle on big reserves like Terbela, Chashma, Mangla,  etc etc. \nSame is the case with Oriental Turtle Doves (Russian Doves). they always follow the route. u have to know their feeding area or resting areas .\n\n2.

(140751, ' DUCK SHOOT\n\n\nThe boy looked at the fast receding duck for a long time till it vanished across the river into darkness. From desperate and imbalanced fluttering of its right wing, it seemed as if it was hit badly and could not go far. He looked back at his decoy spread and started another search pattern into the sky, now helped by the fast approaching light of a wintry dawn. The river Ravi was flowing past and was abnormally full of debris that day. Thick clouds of winter mist was still clinging to the water’s surface and was reluctantly giving way to the approaching warmth of the sunrise. In the brightening dawn more of the sky beyond the U bend in the river was becoming discernable, and faint lines of waterfowl in the far distance could be easily seen. But all the birds were apparently crossing the river about 3 miles downstream from where he was sitting in his small but effective blind. \n	He had carefully selected this point on the river after leaving the pakka road leading from Niazbeg towards the ferry crossing at the river. The spot was a small but elongated pool hardly more than 50 yards in length and a few yards across. It was nothing more than a puddle left by the receding river, and was a common phenomenon in the month of December when most of the river water was diverted by Indians controlling the flow into Ravi. As he was critically watching the decoy spread for improvements in the pattern, a shadowy movement was observed from the corner of his eye. Suddenly summoning all his hunter’s instincts he raised his gun towards the cause of his attention, and while he was doing so he espied the dark green head with quick wing beats of black and white attached to a large body flaring out hardly 40 yards from him. \nThe much-coveted Mallard was calmly following the river, when it’s keen eyes spotted a raft of ducks enjoying an early morning dip in the apparently safe and placid water off the main river. As it approached within gun range however, it realised the mistake but far too late for it to successfully avoid being shot. It dropped stone dead to a snap shot of number 6 Shaheen at hardly a range of 25 yards. It hit the water at almost same speed at which it was flying and immediately started to drift away with the fast flowing water. The boy could not believe his luck at having connected with two male mallards so early into his shoot, but was dismayed by only injuring the first bird and apparently loosing the second to the deep and fast flowing Ravi. Determined not to loose at least this one so close to him, he jumped out of his blind while at the same time discarding his heavy jacket and boots and running after the bird with his gun still in his hands. He gritted his teeth and took the shock of ice-cold water while at the same time realising that he was still holding his gun, which might prove a hindrance in case he was required to swim. But there was no time left for turning back to deposit the gun on the riverbank due to fast receding silhouette of a very dead bird. As the water reached his chest level, he was hardly a few feet away from the duck, and could almost touch it with the muzzle of his shotgun. Throwing all caution to the early morning breeze, he plunged into still deeper water and started to dogpaddle towards his prize. Despite the hindrance of his gun and almost freezing water, he succeeded in retrieving the bird and reaching the safety of his blind. \nWith natural vigour of a young body, the initial cold spell was overcome, and even the wet cloths started to become warm. But now a steady wind started to blow chilling him further, and also clearing away the remnants of mist from the water. This wind brought with it a sweet and warm smell of ‘dab’, a kind of elephant grass, which grows in abundance along most of our rivers. As the weather grew warmer and sun came up, the chances of any more ducks coming over started to diminish. At around 9’o’clock, he got his breakfast of ‘AluParatha’ out and started to enjoy his meal within confines of his blind. At the back of his mind was the time honoured Shikari myth that the quarry would somehow appear when you start indulging in such non-serious activity as having your meal while waiting for the birds. But on this day, even this failed to produce any more ducks, and with a heavy heart he started to collect his decoys for return crossing of the river in his one-man inflatable boat.\nHe reached for an overhanging branch of a nearby bush in order to haul himself up on the steep bank, while at the same time trying to balance the rickety boat, but in the process he tripped and the boat got out from under his feet. His headlong fall was broken by the thick vegetation on this side of the river, but the commotion created by him caused a sharp fluttering noise in the bushes next to his hidden motorcycle. He immediately thought of a black partridge scampering about in the bushes and got ready for a quick flush. As he moved further to investigate, a big male Mallard suddenly jumped out from beneath his feet and tried to take to the air but one of its wings was so badly broken that it could hardly cover five yards. With adrenalin kicking in, the race was on. He threw away everything in his hands and dove after the injured duck. It was after a great difficulty that he managed to get hold of the duck and placed it next to the first one after slaughtering it. This bird was fully mature and dwarfed the earlier Mallard. \nThe thought of showing these two male Mallards to Aaji (short for Agha Jee, his father) kept him warm and in good spirits on the otherwise boring return journey. He had just turned 15 in November last.', ''),

This includes Olympic Rapid Fire, Free Pistol, Womens Sport Pistol, Mens Center Fire ( 32 S&W Long or .38 special) and then the International Standard Pistol. The Military Rapid Fire;  The Olympic  Air Pistol Match is shot at 10m with one hand. \nThe Speed or combat oriented shooting is done with both hands at Targets ranging from 3m to, 5, to 7 and 10 m and an odd target at 20 m or so.\n I  do speed/combat shooting but\n Mr Steve Cline is a Champion \nof this discipline and he can throw most light on it. These events can be modified and rules laid out arbitrarily by shooters and events related to actual combat situations; even in these matches part of the match is shot by one hand and then by the weak hand alone as well.\nShooting one hand teaches all the finer points of trigger control.\nNow dry firing, one should keep a plastic dry firing device which is usually available with Match pistols or keep a piece of 1/16 inch thick leather between the breach face and chamber in case of rim fire or .22 pistols and a fired case in the chamber  of center fire pistols and replace it every 5 or 10 firings.\nA good air pistol is the best training aid which you can train with, inside your house even and is the most difficult to master due to the long Barrel Time of the pellet and teaches one the importance of Follow Through', ''),

This means the shooter shoots it almost anyway he wants.

It''s .45 cal, muzzle velocity 850-900 fps, yet with a 230 grs projectile, transferring some good impact energy.\n\nIf looking for a 1 shot man[b]hurter[/b], any of the remaining 9mm''s above, muzzle velocity some 1100-1300 fps, grainage some 115-125, being the most common. Selected ammo, 147 grs.\n\nStopping and hurting 1. shot hits above, meant funnily. Course you can stop and eliminate with 1. st. shot even with the 9mm also, yet the .45 transfers more impact energy, larger wound, tissue damage, more bleed, quicker elimination.  :)  \n\nBaikal Vikink, etc, got longer barrels than above, hence MV will be slightly more, so will accuracy and effective range. Yet for CQB, it means nothing significant. They''re more of range and HD guns, the other ones above are carry and SD weapons.  :)', ''),

(140938, ' There are lot other actions, I am comparing R8 straight pull with turn bolt action.  In my opinion the R8 straight pull action is the fastest form of bolt action but lacks other important features. \n\nR8 is nearly more than double in price in America. I was just trying to figure out the efficiency of R8 in comparison with bolt-action rifle, to see if there is any real advantage or if it’s just a beauty.\n\nAs a friend has written it a beauty and a Merc, Like another friend mentioned there are only 2 in Pakistan. I agree and I have written in my post it’s a beauty.  In the End all comes to personal satisfaction. Any way if I have to go off road, ill opt for a reliable Jeep than a luxury car.\n\n[b]Murphy’s Law reads: "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it."[/b]\n\nAny thing that can go wrong will go wrong. I will go for turn bolt. \n\nStraight pull rifles is not something new they are around since 1884. Steyr- mannlicher M1895, Ross and few others, such rifles never been popular during wars because they sacrifice too many qualities of the turn bolt e.g. camming action on extraction, controlled feed and extraction, Simplicity of design, field cleaning without tools, most reliable type of repeating rifle, stronger than any other type.\n\nIn any weapon Reliability in all aspects is very import. For example Africa is one place where one needs two different calibers for planes and dangerous games. Ill personally prefer taking two rifles than two barrels. \n\nI think R8 reloads slightly fast as compared with a lever or slide action, and slower if compared with an automatic rifles. All three actions are seldom recommended for use on dangerous game due to reliability, especially in adverse conditions,\n\nPH uses Doubles or Mauser type bolt actions rifles. I don’t see a PH on Dangerous game will ever use R8.\n\nI heard R8 is worth $$$$$$$ here in Pakistan. If I have to spend this sort of money ill go for a double.', ''),

Someone they trusted told them it was bad and they simply believed it. \n\nFor more than 40 years professional shooters like the US Army Marksmanship Unit and Olympians have been dryfiring center-fire guns for hours each day.  It did not hurt the guns.\n\nThe better question is to ask the "never dry-fire a gun" proponents to explain how it harms the gun.  Then ask them to cite the study which supports their position.

The dog decided not to bark since the master did not take good care of him and wanted to teach him a lesson. The donkey got worried and said to the dog that if he doesn’t bark, the donkey will have to do something himself. The dog did not change his mind and the donkey started braying loudly. Hearing the donkey bray, the thief ran away, the master woke up and started\nbeating the donkey for braying in the middle of the night for no reason.\n\n[b]Moral of the story: “One must not engage in duties other than his own”[/b]\n \n\n\n[b]Now take a new look at the same story…[/b]\nThe washer man was a well educated man from a premier management institute. He had the brain for looking at the bigger picture and thinking out of the box. He was convinced that there must be some reason for the donkey to bray in the night.. He walked outside a little and did some fact finding,\napplied a bottom up approach, figured out from the ground realities that there was a thief who broke in and the donkey only wanted to alert him\nabout it. Looking at the donkey’s extra initiative and going beyond the call of the duty, he rewarded him with lot of hay and other perks and\nbecame his favorite pet. The dog’s life didn’t change much, except that now the donkey was more motivated in doing the dog’s duties as well. In the annual appraisal the dog managed “ME” (Met Expectations) .\n\nSoon the dog realized that the donkey is taking care of his duties and he can enjoy his life sleeping and lazing around. The donkey was rated as “star performer”. The donkey had to live up to his already high performance standards.

Only Chinese companies like JG, Dboys don''t any warranty extended, hence their lower pricing.    \nP.S generally the warranty is only is for 3-6 months for material and craftsmanship related problems, however i can totally understand the hassle it might hv been to get these replicas into the country , from personal experience , and setting up a knowledge base to repair and modify will probably take time. \nAppreciate your effort , Hope we can soon set up a couple of fun games and more people can get involved once they experience airsoft awesomeness :D\n\n[I]For all those that hv doubts abt the pricing Consider this : How ofter can u hv a war game with your friends , shoot them up and then laugh abt it afterwards![/I]', ''),

Every one  should be using the same caliber  and you can then start it, there are different methods of scoring where minimum time wins when all targets  are hit in the "A" Zone for which you will need a timer which records the last shot after you have fed the  number of shots into it.\nOr you can have a stop plate which when shot concludes the string and the time of the clang of the stop plate can be taken with a stop watch. \nYou can have four steel plates  one foot dia  placed two feet distance from one another  and then a 2 x 1 ft rectangle plate  and place another 4 plates of 1 ft dia at 2  ft  distance again . At the word go two shooters start shooting at the plates and the one who downs his four first then downs the center rectangle plate, The one who downs the Center rectangle plate first wins  irrespective of number of rounds fired . You can have these plates at about 20 m and keep them facing at a slight upward angle so that ricochets are not going to come back at you we had two injuries to two shooters both badly hurt and carry ugly scars as jacketed bullets of 9mm came straight back catching one famous gun store owner from Lahore right in the neck.

We exchange views and trying to figure out pros and cons. The model in question is around $3300/ USD. Recently a friend has bought R8  in Canada, and he will bring it to Pakistan. We all know due to restriction on rifles imports, prices has gone up.\n\nThe amount these rifles were sold is not that huge that people on this forum cant afford. Simply it’s not worth it.  I know quite a few friends on this forum owns much more expensive weapons than R8 and I am certain, there be lot more (members).\n\nPlease note Manufactures pay  media to write reviews in the favor of their products.\n\nSo as you have mentioned, you handled it and probably have fired few rounds.I hope the results of your research will enlighten this forum.

Warning shots after the alarm will do the needful adequately.\nIf the BG still persists, then its a solid case that he is possessing fire arms and needs to be dealt with deadly force.[/quote]\n\nIts a good idea to put the Intruder alarm but I don''t think that it will be usefull in our country as the sensors are very sensitive and the alarm will go off even if a spider or fly goes infront of it, specially when you are at home then you can''t go out of your room thinking that alarm will go off in the sitting area or so.\n\nIf a thief is in your house and doing his job it means he is ready to do any thing and every thing I have heard so many mishaps like this in my views the best thing is to use your weapon and just finish him if the situation gets worst.[/quote]\n\nPls let me add that this sensor system is being successfully used by ADT security company. They link it to their alarm network and it works on wireless system alerting them for response in case of intrusion.

(141454, ' I broke in my Baikal MP 153 at a trap session. I fired 100 cartridges but busted disappointingly low number of clays. Little effort on my part and a great input from expert panel on the forum, made me realise that variety of issues including dominant left eye and right hand, one-eye shooting and a poor gun-fit were causing the problem.\n\n[b]What did I do: [/b]\n\n[b]Changing the shooting hand.[/b]\n\nI changed my shooting hand. I became a lefty overnight. It looked and felt very awkward in the beginning but later I got used to it. I used to mount the gun before a mirror and see how I looked:)\nMany a times I thought to keep shooting with the right hand as change is always tough, but Gillani sb''s changing his shooting hand after decades of shooting was a motivational factor. If he can do it, why can''t I.\n\n[b]Then came the gun fit. [/b]\n\nUnderstanding the gun fit is and easy task but doing it on a synthetic stock is almost impossible, though with wooden stock it is practicable. Now the gun fits me in a little strange way. The bottom edge of the recoil pad has to touch precisely one inch below my left collor bone to shoot the gun where I am aiming. The aiming and shooting has improved significantly but at the cost of a very little discomfort. I will expect some more cost-effective input on the issue from Mian sb, Skeeter sb and our forum''s darling 12gauge:). Should I modify the stock or keep it that way.\n\n[b]Patterning the gun. [/b]\n\nI have patterned the shotgun a week ago for the first time. I tested the patterns with all chokes at 25 meters which helped me understand the patterns. Patterning the shotgun is like spending time with your dog or horse. You get to know all of your pet''s habits.\n\n[b]Dry firing.[/b]\n I have done a lot of dry firing and mounting of the gun before the mirror. It helped me develop the required muscle memory. When I am ready to shoot a raising target, my mind is only occupied with the raising clay. Muscle memory takes care of the proper gun mount. Developing the muscle memory for the proper mount is similar to outsourcing a job to someone else. You get the desired result with almost no effort.\n\n[b]Shooting with both eyes open. [/b]\n\nShooting with both eyes helps prevent the blurring of the closed eye. It reduces the strain on facial muscles and is over all more relaxing. Its like talking to a person. It takes away a lot of shooter''s stress. And I also changed one eye shooting to two eye shooting.\nI wear spectacles. (I owe my weak eyesight to the years of watching denovo bro''s favourite genre of silent movies:) To me a target appears as if I am having an ink dot on one of the lenses of my spectacles. I don''t have to move my head to aim at the target, rather I mount the gun where I am looking at and it automatically acquires  the target.\n\n[b]Result of all this labour: [/b]\nI am no more disappointed with my trap shooting and shotgunning experience.\nPS: Now you may be wondering that why I have written that post. All I want is to say thanks to all the people on the forum who helped me a great deal to understand the shotgunning.', ''),

(373820, ' [QUOTE=zainulabdeen;212400]The revalidation exercise has nothing to do with having the statistics of quota of MNA or senators consumed rightly or in excess brother. They do have the data. But let me tell u the background and every one who reads newspaper regularly  knows it as it was a well covered news story of its time . U may remember that supreme courts C.J ordered a probe in the matter of excessive issuance of licenses by MOI , and when high &#8211;ups in MOI just conducted the inquiry superficially ,  glaring fact emerged that nearly 35000 fake licenses have been issued. The method of issuance was in a manner that had  the instructions by the the court  were not issued, such fact would never have surfaced because the booklets issued were genuine and the formal signatures  put on the licenses  were genuine too. Actually these licenses were issued in  the collaboration of lower formation of concerned section and in those licenses , the most important factor, the factor that makes the licenses genuine , means the approval of Prime Minister was lacking . Pursuant to revelation of this fact, the FIRs were also registered against those who were found responsible , interestingly , the person in whose incumbency the largest number of fake licenses were issued , didn&#8217;t belong to relevant service cadre ,rather he belongs to health services, who made his way to federal bureaucracy through marrying a  high ranking federal officer .The number of fake licenses was so huge that serious doubts and reservations were shown by the deciding corners about the ability of present license issuing system to prevent any future mishap of corresponding  magnitude and it was for the first time  that NADRA was brought in to consideration . MOI  reportedly has the data of rightly issued  licenses- , but how to retrieve the fake licenses?...... naturally the revalidation process was the only way out. Now , after taking the photocopy of license, NADRA would send it back to MOI and if that license has the proper documentation and the approval of competent authority back at MOI, the owner would be issued the card license, otherwise&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;?. Here comes the question of a million dollars that what shall be the fate of  the persons whose licenses are not verified in the process . in my opinion there are 2 categories of  that kind of licensees (1) the persons who already know that their licenses will not be verified, thus , naturally they wont opt to undergo the revalidation process means they wont bring their licenses to NADRA centers. (2) the licensees who got their licenses prepared through agents/dealers and these are the persons, who , in my opinion, are on maximum risk as by submitting their licenses voluntarily , with their own hands, along with their NICs and admitting the possession of a fire arm of NPB/prohibited bore , they would  expose their selves, though innocently, not knowing about the violation of law they have committed, to the rigors of law, as the negligence of law is no excuse. The number of 35000 bogus licenses is so huge that every law abiding citizen, having  license issued in that particular period and having no conformity about the genuineness of his license should be careful[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nVery well said.No one could have summed it up better.', ''),

He makes excellent grips but takes his own time which may be several months or sometimes more than a year. Lets see how early I can get them made, but one thing is for sure that what he would make would be better than the grips that we get in over 50$ from US. I saw the grip of a S&W revolver made by him and they were surely better than the original Made in USA grips.

It will take time but it is the step in right direction. \n\nI am no expert on shotgun shooting so would refrain from giving any advise. The only thing I would say is that IMHO, master eye matters more in shotgun shooting than anything else. To get clear understanding of depth perception, one should shoot with both eyes open. And when you shoot with both eyes open, the dominant eye would take over. And if you are shooting with right hand and left dominant eye, the axis would never be straight and you would never be accurate with you shots. This is my humble view, I am sure experts like Skeeter sahib, 12guage, Mian sahib, Muneer sahib and Ahmed Sultan sahib would have something to say on this as they know the shotguns much better than I do  :) \n\nStay the course buddy  :)', ''),

(141582, ' @Stigma and Ilyas Thank you, Turkey is really a wonderful place. I spent some time in Istanbul and then I flew to Antalya for a couple of days. Troy is nothing anymore except rubble and a fake wooden horse to attract tourists. I did not want to waste my time. I actually wanted to go to Konya to spend some time at Jalaludin Rumi''s tomb but surprisingly Konya is not a big tourist attraction and the only two large hotels there were booked solid.  Capadocia is a wonderful place to visit if you''re traveling with family and like to see natural wonders. I was with a friend so did not go there. \n\n@Ak47 Malaysia is a better destination for shopping, but Turkey is where the soul of the Muslim empire still lies. A trip there will surly invigorate you more than any where else. Even a week''s tour of Istanbul is enough to make one understand how great we were and where we went wrong and lost everything. It a personal opinion but I think if the Sultan did not build the Dolmabache palace and spent that exact same amount on his army the Ottoman empire would still exist.\n\nReturn flights cost around Rs. 50,000 per person approx, 30 days visa is around Rs. 4,500 and I assume most travel agents can arrange it. Three star hotels cost around Rs. 6,000 per night, 4 around Rs. 8,500 and  5 around Rs. 12,000. The area of stay for a tourist should only be in the Sultanahmet area which is where most of the tourist attractions are. Restaurants are everywhere but street food is awesome and cheap, around Rs. 400 buys one a king size meal. Most of the food there are kind of Shawrma''s, it''s like they have 1000 varieties of it. The best thing to eat there is Ice cream :) which is insanely good and no where else available in the world. The only place where I have seen 10 liters of ice cream being thrown in the air and being caught with a stick and spun in the air, all without a single drop melting. \n\nPork, Alcohol is widely available everywhere even more easily than in the west. However easy to avoid and move on,  no where will you find drunks misbehaving. Police sweeps in and whisks them away.\n\nScammers are all over the SultanAhmet and Taksim area''s. The most common scam is that a well dressed man will introduce himself to you while you are walking on the street and speak to you in Turkish, when you reply that you don''t speak the language they will talk to you in English and ask you where you''re from. Once you say xyz country they will say something like "but you look Turkish" and immediately followed by telling you they have some friends from your country. Then next thing they will ask you is where you''re going. You say you''re a tourist and they will offer to take you to the best bar/club/restaurant in Istanbul where he is currently heading and only the locals know about. The dumb tourist takes the bait and goes with him, which ever place he goes to is generally great, there friendly women come and sit with him etc. After some time the bill arrives and the tourist is presented it, it usually is an insane amount like $ 2000 USD etc. Once he protests everyone including the new found friends and bar/restaurant management turn hostile and tell him to pay up or else. Ofcourse no one is carrying that much cash on them so they either keep his passport/wallet or ID and tell him to go get the cash asap.\n\nHowever these scams are easy to get out of. Since my friends were Turkish and Istanbul locals it was not an issue for me, they told me beforehand and regardless I''m not a bar/club kind of person. I was approached an incredible 9 times during my 8 day stay in Istanbul. The way out is simple, when they ask you where you''re going tell them to meet up with friends who are waiting for you. They will always ask about them, tell them they are Turkish and you are actually here visiting them. Once they hear you have local friends they will make a quick excuse to bounce as they understand that if you know a local he would have warned you about this common scam.\n\nAnother scam is on my first night there I was talking a relaxing walk next to the Blue Mosque and a gentleman came up to me and introduced himself as the Director of the Blue Mosque, (it was hard to keep a straight face) He told me to go see Ayub Ansari''s tomb which is a good 10 km''s away from where I was, I told him I would go see it during my trip but he insisted that I get in a particular cab and go see it right then. Lolz inwardly I wondered if I really look that foolish? :| So in a nutshell avoid anything that you think looks suspicious and you should be fine. No one can/will make you do anything that you are not really asking for. \n\nApart from that Turkish people are lovely, the men are kind (Taxi drivers exempted), the women are beautiful and modest (most of them) and the law and order situation allows you to do anything you want.  \n\nKL does not compare if your primary purpose of visit is not shopping. Shopping btw is kinda expensive in Istanbul akin European prices. \n\nAs far as Gun and accesories, don''t get me started, I researched a bit and found the largest gun store in all of Turkey called ''Silasi Duniya'' or roughly "Gun World". It was at the other end of the city, a cab from Sultanahmet costs 10k coming and going and that frankly was money wasted. At reaching my first comment to my friend was "Is this it?". It was a medium size store with about 100 shotguns, crappy .22 pistols which looked more Daara made than anything else and no handgun they would show to me specially after I told them I was from Pakistan :| Shotguns were mostly Turkish made and cost more there than they do here in Pakistan. They had a few good shotguns as well but more expensive than here. Air pistols were a few but crappy like crossman and brands I had never even heard off. Even with a Turkish friend as a translator I could not make them understand that I wanted a grip for a Walther SSP. Each time I said the word Walther they would ignore the rest of the sentence and pull out a P22. I was like (where is the head bang smiley gone?). They did have good air pellets, some hunting gear, lots of knives and shooting targets. \n\n@Ka_Khan and Ilyas As far as the hamam''s ;) I''ll just share one NPB picture with you if I can find it. \n\n@Aquarius Thank you. \n\nBtw it might surprise you guys to know that some of these pictures were taken from my Camera phone.', ''),
(141585, 'Bulk C02 Modification those c02 bottles are very expensive at £7.50 for an 88 gram bottle which you only get 100 full power shots from and about 200 before it is finished.\nSo i decided to get a  20oz (560 gram) paintball bottle and a remote line to connect to the rifle,i also needed a paintball to 88 gram C02 thread adaptor which i searched on the net for,i found 2 places to get them norway and the USA and both were out of stock and wanted £28 for it plus postage. This morning i purchased the paintball tank and the remote line ,the line came with a quick release fitting and a foster nipple,i got my mig welder out and cut the threads off the nipple and welded it to the back of an empty C02 cartridge and using  the hole in the nipple as a guide drilled a hole through the rear of the cartridge .Next i drilled out the puncture hole at the front of the cartridge to aid gas flow, then blew all the swarf out with an airline and then ran a full can of brake cleaner through the cartridge  to clean the insides.\nI screwed the modified empty cartridge to my rifle i had to cut a small hole in the front of the stock to pass the remote line through and connect it to the foster nipple on the back of  the modified C02 cartridge, then i opened the valve on the paintball bottle and the gun was charged with C02.so i saved about £30 for the adaptor\nI will make the next empty cartridge with a  one way nipple so i can refill  the cartridge  and disconnect the quick release from the nipple to remove the  line and paintball bottle, this mod will save me loadsa money.In my garage i have a 5 kilo C02 fire extinguisher all i need to connect that to the paintball tank is a foster nipple and i will be able to refill my paintball tank using the fire extinguisher :) it only costs £2 to fill the fire extinguisher with 5 kilos of C02 which will fill about 8 paintball bottles or 56  cartridges which i reckon will be at least 5600 full power shots or in other words 56 times 88 gram cartridges to buy at £7.50 each would come to £420.\n\nCLICK TO ENLARGE IMAGE\n[url=http://img687.imageshack.us/i/pict0023tq.jpg/][img]http://a.imageshack.us/img687/1862/pict0023tq.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://img5.imageshack.us/i/pict0014p.jpg/][img]http://a.imageshack.us/img5/7529/pict0014p.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://img191.imageshack.us/i/pict0019i.jpg/][img]http://a.imageshack.us/img191/3756/pict0019i.th.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://img185.imageshack.us/i/pict0021gy.jpg/][img]http://a.imageshack.us/img185/8386/pict0021gy.th.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

I''m kind of amazed to see that you didn''t encounter with many shops as such! I really expected you to be moving around full "bazaars" of these things, taking into consideration that Turkey got a booming industry of these articles. Imports also, like the grips you wanted, should have been commonly available there, and from where you got the De Santis Thuck This II holster?  :rolleyes: \n\nHonestly, even over here in our own country, I detest going to our local towns, i.e Muree, etc, if I can''t find my devoted articles! Every time, I''m around in Muree and other short excursion places, except for Peshawer, Lahore, and see all the leather stuff, suede items, cowboy hats, cowboy long boots, etc, heck can''t control my eyes looking out [i]hopelessly[/i], in the search for an innocent [b]holster[/b] at least!  :lol:  \n\nSo, I really expected some more availability of these things in Turkey.  :( \n\nStill, it''s a nice place, I''m sure, and worth a visit, and about those [b]shawarma''s[/b], oh boy, boy, boy, you just brought about a waterfall into my mouth, they got the genuine stuff of these, we can''t come even 50% close to over here.

(141744, ' @ Shooterz.\n Let me explain in a bit detail,why a good pump action is recommended for HD:\n\n1st of all the ideal home defense shotgun should consist of a short barreled model, 18- to 22-inches, chambered for 12- or 20-gauge.High quality pump action shotguns offer a distinct advantage over auto in the sense that their operation tends to be mechanically reliable, even under the worst of adverse conditions.There is no sound in the world quite as identifiable or as intimidating as the rhythmic "click-click" of a pump action shotgun being racked.  Again, in a home defense situation, the gun owner is cautioned to secure any loaded firearm, including a pump action shotgun, in a responsible manner.A  reliable, well made pump action shotgun can usually be purchased at a cost less than a comparable quality handgun.  Advantages of the shotgun are threefold.  There exists less danger of harming third parties through walls in the event of an errant shot; the potential for inflicting wound trauma to a criminal assailant is maximized, thus halting a violent confrontation quickly; and it is easier to hit one''s attacker with a shotgun when compared to a handgun.A  superior quality auto represents an acceptable alternative to the pump.  The action of the finer models tends to be flawless.  As with any autoloader, one must be careful after the initial shot not to inadvertently discharge the firearm.For home defense, however, use 2-3/4-inch shells.Trust me! you cant go wrong with a good quality pump action.Hope this helps.', ''),

(141754, ' God forbid, if one is caught in a situation with a thief/dacoit/burgler in house, chances are that they already will have the advantage of surprise. Most people wouldnt have time to react in the first place. \n\nIf, by chance one gets time to react, by virtue of an advance warning (a dog bark/motion sensitive camera/just good old sixth sense) it would be EXTREMELY WRONG to start shooting purely on instinct. Chances are either you will do harm to yourself/your love ones in the house by taking his action, OR in best case scenario,  would have the complete onus of proving in the court later that the intruder was armed and there was reasonable and sound proof to assume that his intention was to cause bodily harm or hold hostage you/your family and not just simple robbery (steal and run, even if he was amed). \n\nFirst thing instead of grabbing a semi auto or auto weapon and start shooting, would be to gather about your wits and do a quick situation analysis. This would include: \n\na. Does the intruder seem to be carrying a gun/weapon? \n\nb. What appeas to be the motive of the intruder? Does it look like a robbery (steal ad go), dacoit (holding hostage for money), or settling a personal grudge/enimosity (if you recognize the person)? \n\nc. Does the intruder seem to have a back up/others accompanying him? If yes, do they appear to be armed? If no backup in sight, how sure could you be that there would be none in other parts of house? \n\nd. Whats your vulnerability? Do you have family members in other parts of the house? Is it reasonably safe to assume that their doors would be locked and thy would be safe inside? Could you reach them/secure them first before making a move against intruder? \n\nYou wil probably have seconds to make a quick assesment of all questions above, and make a decision. If the risk of itruder being armed, or having backups, your family''s vulnerability to be high and intention of intruder not being to take some revenge or cause bodily harm but just theft or burgerly is HIGH then it is better NOT to start shooting. You would be better off not even exposing your weapon for fear of retaliation from the intruder by having him open fire. In a situaion like this, its best t do whats best to do in car snatch scenario: Just give up any resistance, comply, lie low and preserve yourself and your loved ones. Money and wealth once looted can be re-collected or earned. But life once lost is irreplaceable.\n\nIn a situation when the intruder doesnt appear to be armed, or doesnt appear to have a firearm in his hand at least, chance of backup low and family''s immediate vulnerability to be reasonably low, then it is best to hold your gun and challenge the intruder. If he complies and gives up, hold him up on gun point and call police. Let him escape with warning shots above his head if he tries to escape without trying to bring out a weapon or use of force. Shoot in the head at the first sign of resistance/attempt to bring out any weapon. \n\nIn a situation where the intention of intruder is clear or reasonably safe to assume (which you could later prove in a court of law) is to cause bodily harm to you or loved ones due to some personal grudge etc, or to kidnap you/your loved ones, or to toil wth the honor of the home, or any other intention other than a simple robbery/burgelery, screw the consequences, screw the damn logic, law and self preservation principles, and shoot till you kill or get killed. There is most definately no sitting on the fence in this case. No shot in the leg, no warning shot, no nothing. Its you or him. \n\nHowever this last scenrario is a extreme scenario and hence calls for extreme use of force. In all other cases its best not to try becoming a cowboy and be trigger happy. \n\nThats my two cents on the topic. \n\n:)', ''),

(141775, ' [quote=Syed Adeel]Well I came across this thread today.\n\nI love horses very much. Can even tame and [b]break[/b] them to an extent. I have been doing ''Tent Pegging'' for the last 20 years. Have seen horses in our stable ever since my childhood as my ancestors were known for rearing and keeping some fine pleasure riding, and tent pegging horses. I have been participating in some horse shows and have been involved even in training of many novices and had made some fine riders.\n[/quote]\n\nIts good to see another fellow who likes horses and tent pegging.\nBut i would Disagree with the breaking of the horse.\nTaming it and breaking it are two diffrent things, Taming it is getting it used to the man and to start trusting the man and then the horse willingly does what the man  asks it to do.\nBreaking it is making it wear the hardware and then forcing it to work for you.\nNo doubt you are my senior and would have greater knowledge than i have but I thought id just give my view on working with horses\n\nRegards', ''),

FULL AUTO FEATURE, the so called silver lining of Zigana F, as you rightly said, is a useless feature on a handgun. I simply don''t find anything in Zigana F for which one should pay 100k, except the option of firing a few cheap looking bursts in aerial firing mode during marriages etc in an effort to tell the people in a cheap way that I have got a hell of a gun. If one is thinking of converting Zigana F in some kind of an SMG by adding some rony type kits to it than in my humble view, it is a non-productive idea and far from practical utility expected out of such a weapon :mad:  \n\nI will add this test to the master list given on page 1. \nregards', ''),

(141921, ' fahad sahib, very good shooting. Please do not be hesitant of posting your results, no matter how good or bad they might be, if you really want to learn. And please do also keep in mind that only those fail who try. And they are the ones who subsequently learn. Those who do not try will never fail (apparently) and would also never learn (surely).   :) \n\nFew points from my side. \n-  Please use the 25 M precision shooting target for deliberate fire (the one that is shown in the last pic). Rapid fire target has almost double the size of each ring and is meant for rapid fire practices. \n\n-  Shooting from 25 m is not easy so please don''t be dis-heartened with the results. For the time being, you may keep practicing from 15 M, then move on to 20 m and then to 25 M. \n\n-  Please concentrate on basics and do not be bothered much about the scores. Focus more on making a smaller group. \n\n-  Three cardinal points to focus are; focus on front site tip, good trigger control and good breathing control. \n\n-  Bad trigger control is responsible for more fliers than any other mistake. A shooter with good trigger control will never be far off the target and would also achieve reasonably good scores.\n\n-  Each string should be five bullets. So its 5, 10, 15 and 20 bullets for four strings 1-4.  \n\n-  Some very good tips have been given by Skeeter sahib at the start of this thread. Please follow those drills.  \n\ngood luck and regards  :)', ''),

Dear sir Plz mention some hallmarks and characteristics / qualities of a [b]good[/b] Makarov, making it easy for us to choose a better one when selecting one to save us from making a mistake while distinguishing between ( Darra made Maks, and genuine KGB approved, soviet  made [b]original[/b] Maks) I mean nishanian and also keh kia kia hona chahiyah aur kia nahin.. making it a better Mak. [/quote]\nAdeel sahib, our darra people have come up with some very good copies of Makarov which from outside just look like a original Makarov and have the same markings that an original Makarov has. So its not very easy to recognise from outside. \n\nHowever, from inside, its a different story and one can clearly see the difference in machining of an original and fake makarov. Manay internal parts of original Makarov have a reddish shade in the metal and are finely machined. Morever, the slides of two original Makarovs would be inter-changeable. If a friend of yours has an original Makarov, take it along and put the slide of the other Makarov on this one and vice versa. The slides should change without any problem. In case of a fake, the slide would not be inter-changeable. But this method can not be tried if your don''t have a Makarov owner friend  :| .\n\nOther than this, the raking of slide, the quality of trigger, the smoothness of magazine release lever would tell you that this is an original. Specially the trigger in a fake one would be far far inferior to the original, which is very crisp and has minimum play. The recoil spring of original Makarov has a smaller diameter at the breach end and bigger diameter at the muzzle end. But this thing has been copied in few fake Maks as well. \n\nAnother sign could be that original Makarovs would be around 20 years old at least and would accordingly have signs of wear and tear (unless you find one like me which had remained well preserved in a box for over 15 years and I had personal knowledge of this  :cool: ) .  The fake ones are mostly very clean looking with fresh bluing. But this is not a very authentic way of checking a Makarov. \n\nBuying it from a trustworthy dealer whom you know since long would also help a great deal. But please do it soon because Maks are getting more and more expensive with every passing day.  :( \n\nHappy search for a Mak  :)', ''),

The rabbit hunting lights havea much larger and stronger beam project light really far and MUCH more light than these ones.\nI hope This helps.\nP.S if you want a Rabbit hunting light get a high power light something like this one \n[url]http://www.magnalight.com/pc-47085-64-15-million-candle-power-rechargeable-hid-pistol-grip-handheld-spotlight-35w-hid-25-hour-run-time.aspx[/url]\nThis has a High output and is rechargeable so it would be easier to use this.\n\nRegards', ''),

Built in a variety of variations, including one that handles the blonky 12 gauge 3.5" magnum shells, this action is obviously quite versatile. Add to that the good looks and reliability that Beretta shotguns are known for, and it sounds like a winning combination.

This gives me confidence that I can engage a target at 100 yards with a handgun  :) \n\nThe bullet drop of PT99 with POF2Z ammo at 100 yards was estimated around 9 inches at an average which is not bad. Not bad at all. This makes PT99 an accurate gun at 100 yards or so. I will also try other handguns at 100 yards and see the bullet drop in their case.

Heck, when I inquired recently again, it was standing at some 5.5M!!  :o The prices have sky-rocketed and that''s the actual problem in selecting amongst this class of vehicles.  :( \n\nI''m still of the firm opinion, considering the way that we guys drive our vehicles during a span of few years, that as far as being in Pakistan is concerned, one should really always try averting second hand vehicles! \n\nIf you can''t afford a brand new Corolla at 1.4M over here, better take a brand new City. If you can''t afford that one either, go for something else, but brand new, Liana, Cultus, whatsoever. And if you can''t afford a brand new four-wheeler at all, heck, better take a brand new Bicycle, but don''t take what may have been abusively used, yet apparently nice and well conditioned, and end up spending more time and money on repairs/renewals, than on your pleasure on the roads!  :) \n\nThat''s actually my dilemma!  :)', ''),

(142308, ' Was in Haripur today to see our brother Syed Adeel Sb and had a great time with him as usual. We spent some good 7 hours together, and I really appreciate his great hospitality once again.  :) \n\nToday was both Gup n'' Shoot, and we really did try out quite a variety of [b]ALL[/b] forms, yet prominently handguns, and as of such, following arsenal was at our disposition:\n\n1) [b]The PT 145[/b]\n\n2)[b] CZ-999[/b]\n\n3) [b]SARSILMAZ KILINC[/b]\n\n4) [b]CF-98[/b]\n\nIt appeared we got quite of a "[i]Chupa Rustam[/i]" in Syed Adeel bro, both as regards toys, as well as his shooting expertise with these! Heck, he wouldn''t agree to shooting from any less than [b]25 Mtrs[/b], and I really had to force him to some variable distances, like 7, 10, 15 and 20 Mtrs!\n\nThe pics are with him and I trust he''ll post them at earliest convenience, yet let me just give you some brief outlines:\n\n[b]Ammo[/b] used was: POF 2Z in 9mm. Prvi Partizan, Armscor, .45 cal.\n[b]Guns[/b]: As above\n[b]Shooting distances[/b]: 7, 10, 15, 20 mtrs.[b] AND[/b] 150mtrs( [b]450-500 ft)[/b]  ;) \n[b]Targets[/b] : PG Target Charts.\n\nWe fired alternate strings of [b]5[/b] shots throughout.\n\nWinner of the day was unquestionably Syed Adeel bro, with his remarkable [b]37/50[/b] points, with the [b]CF-98[/b], from [b]20mtrs[/b].  :o \n\nIn my opinion, this string could easily have reached 42/50 from [b]20mtrs[/b], a remarkable score indeed, yet the first shot was just quite a peculiar hit, we need to have analyzed from Seniors.  :rolleyes: \n\nSecond best, was my own shooting from [b]15 mtrs[/b], with the [b]CZ-999[/b], [b]37/50[/b], with a very tight group of 4, first shot here also was a peculiar hit, could have upped the score as well.  :)  \n\nStoppages were [b]NIL[/b], with any of the guns.\n\nThere were quite some lousy episodes too, ( My own shots with the PT 145, 11/50!!!) but the frequent change of guns, I feel, was the culprit behind. Syed Adeel bro, however managed [b]30/50[/b] with this gun, from [b]10mtrs[/b].\n\nI feel, in order to do progress, [b]ONE[/b] gun should be used throughout the session, since you can''t adjust to changing grips, barrel lengths, recoils, after each string. We just had too many guns to try out. The [b]450ft [/b]target was hardly visible, yet we still managed to get some shots on it with long rifles, 30-06, 7.62, etc, using iron sights.

You need real time experience with actual rounds and condition to adjust the sight. \nFor example, if keep the wind out of equation, alone humidity and temperature will effect the sight alignment, i.e. sight adjusted in less humid and cool environment will not be as accurate in warm or humid conditions, it is process of continuous  adjustment in real time condition which gives you accurate idea and experiences to do the setting in one round.\nIn my opinion, the bore sighter is fancy gadget and can be helpful in the beginning but it will reduce your learning experience in the long run and real time condition and one will end up spending on the bore sighter, rounds in real time conditions and reduced learning.\nThe sight adjusted', ''),

Thank you very much sir for your analysis and appreciation, though the comment on hitting the bull with CF 98 from 20 meters (the awaited one) is still being awaited  :) \n \nAs regards AK 47''s Kilinc 2000, I fired it but prior to that I got lost in the trance of the gun''s great\nfeel (the beaver tail area, the great slide to frame fitting, the grip, the slight upward recess in the bottom of the trigger guard for a good double handed grip and the CZ 75 looks, the pointability and so on and fired it for the sake of pleasure of firing it and not primarily for checking its accuracy, for which,  Brother AK 47 and I will have an exclusive Kilinc 2000 firing session and let you know.  \n\nThanks for warning about the ricochet of the bullets. Ak 47 sahib and I were concerned about the matter and after much deliberation, when we were confident enough that the surface was not flat and hard and the bricks were weaker than the force of the round and would let the bullets pierce them and enter instead of a rebound then on an almost zero apprehension of a ricochet we went for the shots... Still you are right sir! Safety and care comes first. Will be more careful next time Insha ALLAH.\n\nThe long range targets of 30-O6 were at a lower level and we were at a higher level so the bullets went straight into a ground which was all soil and dirt, having even no chances of a ricochet even. So we did consider the rule " Know your target and [i]beyond[/i]"\n\nAnd you are always more than welcome dear sir.

(142689, ' [quote=12gauge][b]AoA Everybody[/b]\n\nMe and Rotorcraft went to skeet field this Friday to conduct the long over due test of his newly acquired semi-auto shotgun manufactured by Mir Alam Sb. in DAK. We reached quiet late cause honestly it was a last moment kinda urge. anyways, It was late and every thing was done in a hurry (but properly) as the light was fading.\n\nanyways here are the main results of the test: (point wise)\n\n1. weight: a little on the heavy side but not at all uncomfortable, the gun was pretty quick to mount.\n\n2. balance: right in the middle. neutral balance. good i guess cause its mostly personal preference.\n\n3. trigger: very nice. crisp, no creep, no pre-travel. good trigger.\n\n4. LOP: perfect for rotor but a little short for me. even on the patterning board I was shooting it high.\n\n5. patterns: since the time was short so pattern testing was sorta conducted in "guestimation" mode. in my humble opinion. the patters are pretty good. nice. uniformly distributed. but a little on the tighter side. I guess, since the gun has fixed choke, the manufacturer intentionally opted to make it "modified" to cater to wide variety of hunting scenarios. modified is usually taken as "jack of all" type of choke. overall, good patterns.\n\n6. cycling: boy! the gun cycled fast. faster than most shotguns. no way of accurately measuring it but from "what I felt" standpoint, there was significant difference in cycling speed. it my opinion, its one of the most desired and highly sought after semi auto shotgun traits.\n\n7. reliability: hmmm....... absolutely flawless. some 50 rounds fired just to test the reliability of the gun with mixed loads (light/hunting and heavy/target loads). not even a single failure to feed or fire. the bolt successfully locked back each time the mag ran empty. to be honest, since the gun is desi made, I was expecting some issues but the gun practically ran and consumed everything like a high-end shotgun (a typical stereotype statement) would. in simple words, one could not ask for more.\n\n8. ejection: awesome ejection, 10 to 12 feet minimum with every kind of load.\n\n9. recoil: very mild. mostly because of the heavy weight and semi auto configuration. rotor was comfortably emptying magazine tube full of hard kicking hunting rounds in mere seconds. I could see the BOOMSHAKALAKA! grin on his face afterwards every time he did the "end of the world" drill. It was like Rotor against a hoard of charging zombies.\n\n10. performance: I missed skeet''s first shot. adjusted the aiming technique cause the gun was obviously a little short for my size and then it was like [b]WE WILL, WE WILL, ROCK YOU![/b] (in stereo sound and with two 12-inch dual-coil subs). nothing like consecutive clay busting to bring a happy grin to your face.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nI am definitely getting this gun. it will serve as a good beater gun as well as a good guest gun. way better then the POS semi auto offering of DSA. It makes semi auto DSA look like a cheap toy. HATS OFF TO MIR ALAM SB. awesome job and keep up the good work.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. rotor please post pics as I am having trouble posting them.[/quote]\n\n\nhow would you compare this gun with the turkish 28inch ?\nhave you tried any till yet or not ?\nas its about 13k of a price higher than this one', ''),

Kindly, if you would check the first two pics above, those of the PT 145 firing, you''ll see a shot by Syed Adeel bro at lower left corner of the chart. Furthermore, a few more shots by myself in the next picture, also in this area?\n\n Bear in mind, they were [b]FIRST[/b] shots of the 5 round strings, both in Syed Adeel bro''s case, as well as in mine. What could be the reason for this common mistake, Sir, by both of us, how do we land the shots so off-target?  :rolleyes: \n\nSeems a peculiar common ''trend"! Kindly comment. [/quote]\n\nAK47 sahib, there could be many reasons. [b]But most probably, both you as well as the handgun were not properly warmed up.[/b]  :D \n\nYes, both shooter as well as the weapon need to be properly warmed up before the actual string is fired. Hence the concept of [b]warmer[/b]. And I still recall the shouts of weapon training instructor, " 2 rounds warmer, 5 rounds grouping, on your target............ fire".  :lol: \n\nPoor warming up may result in lack of concentration for the shooter and a comparatively less MV shot (hitting low on the  target) for the weapon. Add to it the poor quality trigger of PT145; no wonder your first shot was a little low. But this happens, nothing to worry about. \nI normally don''t fire the first two shots of the day on my actual target. Though this kind of a warmup is not really required in a SD situation, it is very much needed in a competitive fire. Hope I have been able to answer  :)', ''),

(142957, ' [quote=Abu Hafs] Would a pump action shotgun be a suitable H.D weapon if one were defending against P.B weapons or would one ideally need to defend with P.B against P.B.\n[/quote]\n\nAoA Brother,\n\nFirst of all you must understand the true meaning of HD (Home Defense). when we say home defense, we mean when the fight actually enters our home. when we say HD, we rarely mean distances over 15 yards and in 99% of the times, we are actually talking about distances in less than 20 feet. at this range, a shotgun is recommended because of high hit probability. a shotgun is recommended because its relative easy of operation, a shotgun is recommended because of quick aiming ability at moving targets.\n\nWhy a pump? well..... the logic behind is that a pump mechanism is quiet rudimentary and doesn''t require that much in maintenance. what you must understand is that a HD shotgun just sits and sits and sits, totally ignored, collecting dust up the wazoo, till the time you need it to protect your life, honor and property. under these circumstances, the desirable shotgun''s mechanism should be simple and maintenance free. lube or no lube, clean or not, a pump action shotgun just keeps on ticking like a Swiss made watch.\n\nNow you know why I always insist on distinguishing between HD and SD scenario first. HD scenario is totally different. it has its own variables. you need a dedicated gun for it. that gun is only required/asked to do one job given those variables that a typical HD scenario presents. you can opt for a semi auto shotgun but then again, they require periodical cleaning/maintenance and lubrication to function flawlessly.\n\nYou see? a HD gun is basically your totally and utterly ignored gun. forgotten that its even there but when the need arises, it is supposed to deliver upto its maximum potential and there are no excuses. can you expect the same from any other type of gun? if you can or if you can regularly maintain a semi-auto shotgun then by all means get yourself a semi auto shotgun. however I have seen many such claims (including my own) turn to dust over time. its not a hunting shotgun that you''ll cherish, its not a show-n-tell shotgun that you''ll clean every now and then to show it to your friends. sure, you might clean it at first but then, the pleasure turn into an exercise, then it turns into a fatigue. afterwards, its like any other HD shotgun, dirty, dusty and not lubricated.\n\nRemember! "A pump action shotgun and 00 buck is the best home insurance money can buy"\n\nRegards.\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSC00007.jpg[/img]\n\np.s. incase you are wondering what kind of a dedicated HD setup I have in place. here it is (I have not touched/cleaned/lubed this shotgun in years), and its maintained by Mrs. 12gauge and her very meticulous maintenance regime is to just lightly brush it whenever she dusts the room. I must insist that the gun has never missed a beat. last time I used it along side Rotorcrafts gun when we went to range to test his newly acquired shotgun.', ''),

However some general ideas could be:\n\na. Ensure that all point of entrys into the covered area are locked and secured by motion sensetive cameras. There are security systems available in the market that once attached to your door lock and armed, can raise alarm/ switch on lights, lock all doors within the house and even call police. So you could install motion sensetive camera imediately behind (iside) the POE''s which when activated could simply switch on the lights of the complete house, raise alarm, lock and secure all other doors inside the house (which can be opened from the inside only, till security system disarmed) call 15 automatically or all of these in case of a breach into the covered area. \n\nb. It would be good idea to have minimal point of entries into the house. With each addition of point of entry, you are increasing the risk of house break proportionately. Plz note glass windows not backed by steel grill can also be considered as POE (point of entry) in HD ref. As explained above, all POE should be backed by a motion sensetive camera.\n\nc. If you have a tv in your bedroom, having it connected with your security cameras (both the CCTV at the outer parameter, as well as motion sensetive ones inside the POE''s) besides your entertainment system would be a good idea. This was way, you will have the option to switch on the relevant channel on your tv, and scan the complete house without ever getting out of your room if and when an alarm is raised. \n\nd. Keep a semi-auto or pump action within easy reach in your bedroom. If eveything else fails, thats your last line of defence. \n\nHowever always remember that prevention is almost always better than the cure.

(143046, ' Well they do. But breeds like rotts and pitbulls have been known to dislike certain actions..kids have the tendency to grab there ears, tails or simply slap them. Some dogs have been known not to take very kindly to such actions. I have had rotts that simply loved kids, no matter what they did. There is a breeder named Sabuk Majeed in Karachi, he almost lost his own son to his most prized stud, luckily one of his training boys came in between.\n\nThis is not to say, that rotts cant be kept with children, but you have to carefully judge their attitudes at a very young age and plus you have to keep a vigilinant eye on your kid when he is around such a dog. Rotts make very faithful and loving companions, but they require alot of understanding. If you can invest some time into learning about them, before buying them you and your kids will have a friend who will love you unconditinally and will give his life to protect you. \n\nMy  not recommending them to novices is because of this reason. They see a rott, dark colored, dead expression, muzzle power equivelent to a grizzly, paws as big as a wolf, cropped tail and or a pitbull carrying a 24/7 angry expression or a boxer with his punched in face and they think "wow, now i a gonna show this off to my friends and relatives, hey now the gurls will fall flat on me" and thy forget the kinda breed they are handling can make them look really macho and when not kept properly turn around and do the m** c**d on their own masters. \n\nDo keep these agressive breeds, by all means, but learn about them.

(143117, ' The shotgun house is a narrow rectangular domestic residence, usually no more than 12 feet (3.5 m) wide, with doors at each end. It was the most popular style of house in the Southern United States from the end of the American Civil War (1861–65), through to the 1920s. Alternate names include shotgun shack, shotgun hut, and shotgun cottage. A railroad apartment is somewhat similar, but has a side hallway from which rooms are entered (by analogy to compartments in passenger rail cars).\nA longstanding theory is that the style can be traced from Africa to Haitian influences on house design in New Orleans,[1] but the houses can be found as far away as Chicago, Illinois; Key West, Florida; and California. Shotgun houses can still be found in many small southern towns.[citation needed] Though initially as popular with the middle class as with the poor, the shotgun house became a symbol of poverty in the mid-20th century. Opinion is now mixed: some houses are bulldozed due to urban renewal, while others are saved due to historic preservation and/or gentrification.\n\n\n[color=grey]Source Wikipedia.com [/color]', ''),

I have tried many times but they just cant seem to understand the operations of a handgun. this is what I have found out:\n\n1. handguns are difficult to operate as there are too many controls\n2. my wife cannot even rack the slide of certain handguns because she cannot grip them firmly enough to pull them back\n3. my wife cannot pull the trigger with absolute ease because she cannot reach the trigger with her finger while grasping the gun in an appropriate manner.\n4. ladies of my house are absolutely scared of a high speed moving part (slide) in their hand\n5. somehow they are under the impression that handgun recoil throws them off balance and they think that the handgun would probably jump out of their hand when fired.\n\nwhereas with a pump action shotgun:\n\n1. its alot easier to operate\n2. it also gets the shoulder support, sorta hiding the true recoil\n3. there are no moving parts to scare them (ladies).\n4. my wife who is practically no bigger than a shotgun herself, easily shoots slugs out of it\n5. my mother easily racks the shotgun with one hand. something I have not been able to do even to this day.\n6. and the best part "RACK! RACK! I have a gun and I''m not afraid to use it. My husband has taught me well how to use it again you. leave now and you will not face any consequences"\n\nadvantage No. 6 tends to give me nightmares sometimes as it bring serious chills down my spine. have I made a mistake? hahahahahahahaa  :lol:   :lol:   :lol:   :lol: \n\nwait a minute! now I understand..... everytime she says "till death do us apart" she take a look at me and then looks at the pump action shotgun mounted on the wall.

They could rightly act as your backup and reinformcement if and when (God forbid) the time comes. \n\nMy question to Mian sb is: Do you witness any number of womenfolk (large/small number) engaged in the firearm activity/target shooting etc at the domestic shooting ranges? I remember there was some pitures of some participating ladies at Lahore Rifle club beside the men''s team. But I am wondering if we just have had a handful of them or are they a regular feature of any of the shooting club in Pakistan. \n\nI am asking this question becasue in our society, guns are typically steriotyped with a very masculine culture. Most women would dislike this hobby as being too "masculine" for their taste or for fear of being labeled as a tom boy in the society. Heck, I dont think I can convince my wife to even go and visit a shooting range with me.

They are easy to operate and have less recoil. \n\nI read some where in an earlier post , that one shouldnt have to many weapons , in order to avoid confusion. \nWell Sir , the reason I have placed a weapon in every room of the house is because of practical experience. I was being chased by two BG''s inside my house , one of them with an AK and another with a handgun and firing straight shots at me. I was lucky I had a pistol with me, hence I ran down to the basement othervise if there were weapons placed in rooms nearby I would have rushed in one of the rooms and taken cover. \n\nFinally using a 12 gauge for HD, I guess I am inviting a ton of arguments in favour of a 12 gauge for HD. But guys in my personal experience when facing BG''s who are in an offencive mode using Auto weapons , I do not prefer or opt for a 12 gauge. I do have one loaded in close range, but I would always rely on my PB or a atleast a 15 shot semi auto Handgun !!\nI talk with experience of close combat , within my house, 12 gauges in the scenario I faced are useless , they are just good for facing BG''s if they are outside the house and when you have ample time and you are in a position to shoot at them after taking cover (Besides that under stress, no matter how good 12 gauge one is using, he would tend to get the cartridge stuck)\n\nThe things I have shared above are with practical experience !

Apart from low power and poor grouping it is very difficult to clean the gun afterwards. Also shot to shot power and bang differs.\n\nShaheen is good in the price range and for hunting doves, starlings and partridges. However if you intend to hunt ducks and specially the mallards then pl. go for imported ammo. Though the shot spread is determined by gun choke etc but the ammo also matters. shaheen is good for 30-40 yds. Beyond this range mallards are knocked down only with head or neck hit. rest the jackals and foxes feast on them.  In absence of the imported ammo I use shaheen BB for mallards. With the time one learns the gun-ammo performance at different ranges for the species being hunt.', ''),

You have mentioned three calibers , the .30, the 9mm and then the 7.62 G3.\nWell the G 3 ammo misfire rate is perhaps one in ten million, but if the G3 is cocked improperly it will not fire.\nCocking a G3 means slamming the Bolt and Carrier forward by first locking the cocking handle in the locking slot and then slapping it sidewards so that the bolt and carrier go forward with the force of the recoil spring. The G-3 will only fire when cocked in this manner. \nThe army is trained to do so. How ever the policemen are so busy in VIP duties they have no time to train and fire their weapons . The army camps on the long ranges spending weeks and months training hard; and do I miss the years spent on the ranges where the orders are "Firing will commence at first light".\nYou are right this kind of problem would happen  with people not regularly trained.\nThe 9mm military ammo is first class, as pointed out by other senior members earlier, there is some spurious ammo in the market which is causing doubts on the POF ammo.', ''),

(143489, ' Blowback mechanism provides max accuracy hence fixed barrel pistols like Makarov, Walther PP/PPK, most .22 LR pistols etc are the most accurate of all. The disadvantage is that such mechanism is not suitable for a high potency ammo like 9x19 and above. Perhaps the most powerful ammo that can be used in a blow back pistol is 9x18 Makarov. \n\nOther than blowback mechanism guns, all other mechanisms do not have fixed barrel. The amount and method of movement differs from mechanism to mechanism. Like the movement in rotating barrels and barrels with locking lugs would not be same.

We have had some great time till I lost him and never replaced him with another. He was an agressive dog and very very loud. That breed could make a good alarm dog but probably not a good guard dog I guess.\n\nAnother qustion, do you thinkit is possible to combine a guard dog with an alarm dog in house with small children? If yes, whih breeds would you recommend? \n\nMy apologies in advance for asking too many questions! \n\n:)[/quote]\nBrother, quoting from a very senior member here, those who dont ask, they dont learn. I am sorry for the delay in my answer as i was stuck in some personal work, and cudnt reply to questions earlier.\n\n1) As a novice owner, my recommendation would either be a German shepard or a lab. A few people will raise eyebrows as to why i am recommending a lab, but trust me, a lab is an allrounder. Not just a pet or a play thing, these dogs have on numerou occassions defends their homes very successfully. Both the GSDs and LABs are very very intelligent, highly social and highly responsilble animals. Once in a while a GSD can turn out to be aggressive, but thats a trait that is either there as a puppy and can be identified by good breeder or it arises out of mistreatment. But I have never in my 22 years of keeping, raising and breeding dogs heard of a LAB turning out aggressive. They are the most loveable and loving breeds of large dogs around. Mind you their appitites are a bit on the larger side.\n\n2) Yes, definetly yes. You can and you should try to pair a small alarm dog with a larger breed. My prized rott Rocky and my pomperian Rinky were bought on the same day, shared a cage for almost 6 months till it was getting a bit too tight for rocky. Well now they hang out togather, eat food together. They are both males but they never fight. Having a smaller dog with a bigger one has two benifits. Smaller dogs are more vigilint, active and noisier than bigger ones, so if you do have an intruder it would almost always be spotted by the smaller dog and like a radar the information would be transmitted to big guy. Secondly dogs love to run and play cops and robbers. Smaller dogs being more agile, run can circles around the big brutes and not get caught. Its a great excercise for the big dogs to run after and try to catch their smaller counterparts.\n\nLastly your question are always welcome my brother. I hope I have answered your questions well enough. If you feel there is something left out or needs to disscussed please feel free to say so.\nRegards', ''),

She went to the bookstore and bought every book she could find on ice fishing. \nFor weeks she read and studied, hoping to become an expert in the field. Finally she decided she knew enough and out she went for her first ice fishing trip. She carefully gathered up and packed all the tools and equipment needed for the excursion. Each piece of equipment had its own special place in her kit. \nWhen she got to the ice, she found a quiet little area, placed her padded stool and carefully laid out her tools. \nJust as she was about to make her first cut into the ice, a booming voice from the sky bellowed, "There are no fish under the ice!!" \nStartled, the blonde grabbed up all her belongings, moved further along the ice, poured some hot chocolate from her thermos, and started to cut a new hole. \nAgain the voice from above bellowed, "There are no fish under the ice!!" \nAmazed, the blonde was not quite sure what to do as this certainly was not covered in any of her books. She packed up her gear and moved to the far side of the ice. Once there, she stopped for a few moments to regain her calm. Then she was extremely careful to set everything up perfectly--tools in the right place, chair positioned just so. Just as she was about to cut this new hole, the voice came again. \n"There are no fish under the ice!!" \nPetrified, the blonde looked skyward and asked, "Is that You, Lord?" \nThe voice boomed back, "NO THIS IS THE MANAGER OF THE SKATING RINK!"', ''),

"But here''s what to do: take a knife, cut a little X where the bite is, suck out the poison, and spit it on the ground." \nThe guy runs back to his friend, who is in agony. \n"What did the doctor say?" the victim asks. \n"He says you''re gonna die."\n\n\nA policeman was interrogating 3 blondes who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first blonde a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"\n\nThe first blonde answers, "That''s easy, we''ll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"\n\nThe policeman says, "Well...uh...that''s because the picture shows his profile."\n\nSlightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second blonde and asks her, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"\n\nThe second blonde giggles, flips her hair and says, "Ha! He''d be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"\n\nThe policeman angrily responds, "What''s the matter with you two?!? Of course only one eye and one ear are SHOWING because it''s a picture of his profile!! Is that the best answer you can come up with?\n\nExtremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third blonde and in a very testy voice asks, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?" He quickly adds" . . . think hard before giving me a stupid answer."\n\nThe blonde looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, "Hmmmm . . . the suspect wears contact lenses."\n\nThe policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn''t know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. "Well, that''s an interesting answer . . . wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I''ll get back to you on that."\n\nHe leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect''s file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face. "Wow! I can''t believe it...it''s TRUE! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?"\n\n"That''s easy," the blonde replied.

Your point as to using hot round being not recommended for these such guns is also quite accurate.  This is the reason why generally fixed barrel guns are gas operated.  Guns like HK P7 M8 & M13, Desert Eagle, Steyr GB (mine works A-ONE and shoots amazing), AutoMag, Wildey and many more.  The drawback with the gas blowback is one can''t shoot lead or rounds which leave alot of residue because they tend to block the gas vent (especially true with HK).\n@Skeeter 60 - +1, well put as these guns do work very well with suppressors - there is no fulcrum point due to suppressor weight/length to think of cause there are no locking lugs!!', ''),

I shot 50 bullets of Eley High Velocity 40 grains and experienced no stoppage or FTF, FTE . It came zeroed at 25 yards and right from the first shot it was in the bull. I almost jumped with pleasure at my successful purchase. It is actually one of the tightest groups from 25 yards with one hand       (1 inch) with bullets cutting through bullet holes.\n         To be honest the weapon is a success and highly recommended because of its accuracy , quick slide movement good natural pointability match grade barrel , five safeties and impressive blast from 22lr and last but not the least the impressive looks. I am over excited and am actually short of words . \n          The question arrises as to why I did not fire any other type or why not a couple of hundred bullets. well I intend keeping this pistol for a long time is one answer and otherwise during break in 40 grain ammo is recommended and the process is to be completed in at least four sessions of 50 shots each it can be reduced in shots and increased in sessions . \n          I shall keep the members updated about other ammo experience as well and honestly speaking anyone who does plinking and target shooting would benefit from this  handgun. For me it is too good to be true . As far as the price is concerned I consider it for free now ( PAISAY POORAY HO GAEY BHAI) and besides it is available at Orient Traders Lahore please ask them.\n          Thank you all for the best wishes .

So when i pulled a SARKARI 92fs out from the holster...\nthey were amazed, I fired 2 magazines of that Sarkari ammo, 2 bullets didnt fire.\n\nI got so upset, so i decided to use the ammo GIFTED by one of the friends, it was hollow point and chinese made.\nIn a white small box...fired whole box...no issue at all...\n\nNo doubt when robbers are running away and our cops fire there G3s...they dont fire.[/quote]\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion on this issue earlier. You have mentioned three calibers , the .30, the 9mm and then the 7.62 G3.\nWell the G 3 ammo misfire rate is perhaps one in ten million, but if the G3 is cocked improperly it will not fire.\nCocking a G3 means slamming the Bolt and Carrier forward by first locking the cocking handle in the locking slot and then slapping it sidewards so that the bolt and carrier go forward with the force of the recoil spring. The G-3 will only fire when cocked in this manner. \nThe army is trained to do so. How ever the policemen are so busy in VIP duties they have no time to train and fire their weapons . The army camps on the long ranges spending weeks and months training hard; and do I miss the years spent on the ranges where the orders are "Firing will commence at first light".\nYou are right this kind of problem would happen  with people not regularly trained.\nThe 9mm military ammo is first class, as pointed out by other senior members earlier, there is some spurious ammo in the market which is causing doubts on the POF ammo.[/quote]\n\nThanks i really didnt know about the G3 misfire thing.

Just like tampering with the external ballistics of the round. It depends on the caliber in use and by saying caliber we are talking about the amount of gun powder in question, burning rate, peak pressures. \n\nFor example .357sig would be more abrupt than 9mm and 9mm will be more abrupt than .45acp with respect to the kick they generate at their peak preak levels and how fast they get the slide moving/accelerated or... how hard it smahes backwards in simple words.\n\nNow the hand in question, if it is on the slide will eventually retard./hinder its backward movement if not able to cease it completely. Try to think and you will know it would be quite very much hard for a human hand grip to completely cease slide thurst. So eventually i WILL move in a retarded way and you can imagine that will certainly bruise the hand. This is the point most of the members are trying to clear you.\n\nYes this retarded movement on the other hand will SURELY flaw both the spent case ejection or even complete extraction let alone the chambering of next round from the magazine.', ''),

(144084, ' [quote=PUNJTANI5]to all my esteemed friends \n\nplease tell me if dry firing a centerfire does not effect why does the spring of firing pi and or striker goes bad with it \n\nand why on earth did they make available snap caps for centerfires[/quote]\n\nDear PUNJTANI5 you are right in your assumption that if their is no primer base sticking to the fire pin hole, the pin will tend to move forward more than normal eventually compressing the spring harder resulting in bending of the spring e.g light primer strikes or jammed pin inside the channel.\n\nThis is true but chances of the spring failing under such condition is as low as they are on other parts of the gun which account in for reliability. However there are more chances of a faulty spring which came from factory fails the way we just highlighted.\n\nNow there is one more aspect to this if we see mechanically, due to 1- shorter spring installed or 2- longer fire pin made will cause the fire pin to continue its movement forward and out the fire pin hole in a way that is just more than normal resulting in over travel of pin shaft. This can built up metal shavings very miniscle and numerous over time creating gunk in fire pin chanel. The chances that fire pin would break sooner than normal also become higher in this case.\n\nWe can say that in center fire weapons, due to faulty or tampered spring or a tampered fire pin which is off by specs will result in damaging of fire pin on a rate that is very much faster than the rate at which other parts wear during the usage of gun with dry fire. \n\nGlock''s claim cant be proven wrong as I think if a manufacturer is giving gaurantee that dry firing is safe on their make, means they are pretty sure the springs and fire pin dimensions are made with very close tolerances resulting in exact tension of spring and exact movement of fire pin out the hole every time no matter pin hits the primer or air.\n\nFor all other pistols which do not claim dry firing safe do not have confidence on compliance of their parts to specs.. On such pistol, we can pretty logically assume that chances of fire pin failure caused by dry firing would be ... may be yes ... and also may be NO. 50/50.', ''),

(144097, ' [quote=Abu Al Hawl]barrel moves or not moves, flinch is the biggest factor of accuracy!!!!![/quote]\n\nAbu Al Hawl you have pointed out the biggest cause novice shooters like me and most of us here have to face. You spoke of what goes wrong with most of us. The wrong.. the fault of inconsistancy, lack of grouping of shots, in simple words the **bad accuracy** is mostly caused by flinch, then other factors come like the tigger and breath control very much inter linked and finally the grip and sight picture. Through out the process level of concentration and focus is to be kept constant.\n\nFlinching is anticipation of the recoil btw which is not liked by our mind and body as it is a violent act going off just a few inches infront of our face. Anticipation of recoil can make us produce a sudden movement/jerk in our muscles of face or any part of our body including blinking of the eyes. \n\nWe must also see that in delivering a straight shot what is exactly that we miss when we start flinching instead? \n\nIt is the follow through we call it in shooting that we must be able to see with all the focus and concentration the front sight/dot going up (when a shot breaks) in the recoil and then coming down to its default place. Your mind automatically will learn its coordinates i,.e where it started from, how high it went and where it has to stop again when each shot is fired. \nAlso the abrupt movement of any part of the body will require re-adjustment which is not possible in a nano second the shot is gone by then. This is what we miss when we flinch.\n\nBTW proper follow through makes you accurate on paper as well as it is the key to fast follow up shots, double taps or high speed string of shots which will also meet some accuracy requirements as per their application.', ''),

(b) pressure sealing in case of break barrel is more effective as there is just one single joint that opens and closes tightly each time. In case of fixed barrels, there is a rotating pallet loader that has clearances at all of the 360 degrees it has (because it needs to rotate) which makes it difficult to seal all the pressure for the slug firing - thus reducing the muzzle velocity and accuracy.', ''),

Without trying to sound emotional, i will tell you one thing in all my exprience, the best way to train a dog is to spend time with him or her. Dogs are very intelligent creatures, they pick up things very quickly. I used to have a dog, a German shepard, who would take the cow i would buy for slaughter for a walk, since he had seen me do it for a couple of years. It was quiet amusing to see a dog holding the rope of an animal almost 10 times his size and walking it around the neighbourhood. So the best way to teach a dog what you want from him is to do it yourself. Specially in our country. You wont find good trainers here, and lame ones you have will teach your dog in 6 months what you yourself cud have done in 2 weeks.\nOne more thing, 90% of the dogs, know how to shake hand by birth. So if any of you is willing to pay to teach your dog things that they already know, please contact me ;)', ''),

Assuming the barrel locks back at different positions or there is some kind of play / movement in it after being locked. This will change line of fire & ultimately point of impact at longer distances. Such long distances are usually of no concern to air-gunners unless on they are on target papers.

For example, MOST .22 rimfire pistols DON''T deal well with the firing pin slamming into the barrel face, so dry firing them a bunch is not a good idea.\n\nOn the other hand, most centerfire autoloaders are NOT harmed by dry firing. Your average bullseye shooter will dry fire the bejesus out of his pistol for practice, and RARELY does it any harm.\n\nPistols I would avoid dry firing are the following:\n\n1. Lugers, Lahti''s, Nambu''s, and the like\n2. Old striker fired .32 and .380 caliber "pocket pistols"\n3. most .22 rimfire pistols (with exceptions for those with "dry fire" mode on the trigger group)\n4. CZ-52 pistols\n\nPistols that I KNOW are safe to dry fire include:\n1. M1911 pattern pistols in all calibers (except .22 rimfire)\n2. Glocks\n3. Sig-Sauer centerfire pistols, all post war versions\n4. S&W centerfire autoloaders, all versions\n5. H&K autoloaders, all versions\n6. Beretta postwar centerfire autoloaders, all versions\n7.

The country is like an immense floating factory, importing raw material from the whole world and exporting manufactured products.\n\nAnother example is Switzerland, which does not plant cocoa but has the best chocolate of the world. In its little territory they raise animals and plant the soil during 4 months per year. Not enough, they produce dairy products of the best quality. It is a small country that transmits an image of security, order & labor, which made it the world’s strong safe\n\nExecutives from rich countries who communicate with their counterparts in poor countries reveals  that there is no significant intellectual difference.\n\nRace or skin color is also not important: immigrants labeled lazy in their countries of origin are the productive power in rich European countries.\n\n[b]What is the difference then?[/b]\n\nThe difference is the attitude of the people, framed along the years by the education & the culture.\n\nOn analyzing the behavior of the people in rich & developed countries, we find that the great majority follow the following principles in their lives:\n\n1. [b]Ethics, as a basic principle[/b].\n2. [b]Integrity.[/b]\n3. [b]Responsibility.[/b]\n4. [b]Respect to the laws & rules.[/b]\n5. [b]Respect to the rights of other citizens.[/b]\n6. [b]Work loving[/b].\n7. [b]Strive for saving & investment[/b].\n8. [b]Will of super action[/b].\n9. [b]Punctuality.[/b]\n\nIn poor countries, only a minority follow these basic principles in their daily life. We are not poor because we lack natural resources or because nature was cruel to us. We are poor because we lack attitude. We lack the will to comply with and learn these functional principles of rich & developed societies.\n\n[b]The Vision[/b]:\n\nHarvard University rated as the number one university in World University Rankings 2009.

(144634, ' [b]@Crazy Shooter.[/b]...........No wonder if I was the first one to reply on this query!  ;) \n\nWe have quite a number of threads on this gun, but I agree, most of those threads are announcements/acquisitions, perhaps only few are queries.  :) \n\nSo while at it, just a few brief facts on the [b]PT 145[/b].\n\nThe[b] PT 145[/b]:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsTH1FS][img]http://s2.postimage.org/TH1FS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[b]Shooting/accuracy[/b]:\n\n1) Being a [b]subcompact[/b] carry gun, it still has a reasonably accurate point-score at [b]CQB range [/b]of up to 10 mtrs.\n\nThe very purpose of this gun - "[i]Jaan bechaana aur finaah kar dehna[/i]"- with a 230 grs ROCK of a projectile is also best served at this range. \n\nFor reference, watch [b]Gilani Sb''s review[/b] as per following link:\n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=139937#p139937[/url]\n\nAnd if [b]my[/b] modest shooting could prove anything, whatsoever, [b]an amateurs hand[/b], this chart:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsTEsxA][img]http://s2.postimage.org/TEsxA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nEnough on the shooting, I think.\n\n2) [b]Reliability[/b]:\n\nI can speak for myself only, so let me first of all tell you a bit of a secret, that only few of our members and best friends here have known so far, that my present PT 145 is my [b]2.nd[/b] one!\n\nFirst one was simply[i] purchased[/i] from me at "[b]gunpoint point blanc[/b]" by a very close family friend and uncle of mine, who just couldn''t resist it''s feel and never let it go out of his hands when he first held it, during a meet with me! I returned home empty handed, with a cheque for full amount, yet after a prior call to the dealer first securing that he had more of them in stock!  :lol: \n\nAnd [b]both[/b] of these guns, the initial and the latest with a combined firing history of some [b]150 shots[/b] so far, have given [b]NIL ISSUES, NO FTE''S, NO FTF''S[/b], with both FMJ''s and JHP''s. \n\nThus, reliability is on the "HIGH" level, rest assured, and I''m sure Denovo bro would come in with supporting comments on above qualities as well.\n\nFinally, it''s a highly [b]concealable[/b] gun, you''ll have the best of [b]ccw[/b] experience with. My suggestion is just - and it looks and feels much better at hands in reality, than on the pics - plz don''t show it around too much! It looks and feels more of a "space weapon" kind of a gun, and people just can''t put it down, once into their hands.  :) \n\nEnough from me, let[b] Den[/b], [b]Abbas[/b] come forth with more valuable comments, since the two senior most gurus both had inspired me for it, above was just the essence of my experience with it.  :) Regards.', ''),

I hold it this way,, always, point it this way, always, and check it this way, always. Every time.\n\n This can be done at home (and IMO is BESt done at home), before you even go to the range. Dry firing, in a safe way using a routine, would likely help too. Establish Rules, and abide by them at all times. Be a guy who obeys the rules every time\n\nThis way when you finally get on the range she is not facing the unknown rather continuing a the process that has started in the comfort and safety of  the home.\n\nMake sure that hearing protection is used from the first shot even with a .22 let her develop handling and aiming before doing "real-life"scenario shooting.', ''),

Took it for target shooting and let go of nearly 200 rds in quick time. dint skip a single one and never lost balance. kept all the holes within a one foot radius on the target on semi auto rapid fire without bothering to zero. then my niece who is an amateur shot off 3 mags and did the same.\nnext i started the zeroing process and within 6 shots it was done. Then I began competitive shooting and managed 2inch groups without a scoop at 100y. Used Federal high velocity bulls. It is heavy for a .22 but I have always preferred my guns to be a little on the heavier side. Gives me better balance. The only drawback, and I presume a big one. Very hard to smartly dismantle and clean throughly at home. Plasticky and toy like but very pleasing to shoot. Still looking for a remington or a winchester .22lr.\nOne thing I wanted to make clear. While making groups, the time delay between each shot was 1-1/2 to 2 minutes. Was sitting on the table with the gun rested on a support and elbows on table.

(144971, ' Salam to ALL,\nWanted to say a few things about GSG-5. Went and bought the anniversary titan. Took it for target shooting and let go of nearly 200 rds in quick time. dint skip a single one and never lost balance. kept all the holes within a one foot radius on the target on semi auto rapid fire without bothering to zero. then my niece who is an amateur shot off 3 mags and did the same.\nnext i started the zeroing process and within 6 shots it was done. Then I began competitive shooting and managed 2inch groups without a scoop at 100y. Used Federal high velocity bulls. It is heavy for a .22 but I have always preferred my guns to be a little on the heavier side. Gives me better balance. The only drawback, and I presume a big one. Very hard to smartly dismantle and clean throughly at home. Plasticky and toy like but very pleasing to shoot. Still looking for a remington or a winchester .22lr.\nOne thing I wanted to make clear. While making groups, the time delay between each shot was 1-1/2 to 2 minutes. Was sitting on the table with the gun rested on a support and elbows on table. Used binoculars to access each shot and DID mess up 30% shots.', ''),

(145120, ' @Mian-50... Sir, nicely put forth the use of middle bead. And as Hamid Sb. said, its a matter of personal preference as well. Some people will simply reject the very existence of second bead and then there will be a few other who will use holographic / red dot sights and shotgun scopes to acquire & shoot their targets. There is some information scattered here and there about the users who prefer this & more who hate the use of second bead. Purpose of the video was just the information about its location as I couldn''t post a picture of it, though, the presenter talks about shooting with its help in the beginning. \n\nAn interesting observation I would like to share with my brothers here. A friend of my father''s (and few others that I know from previous generation) feel disgraced if mentioned to engage 4x4 in soft sand and mud. And equally annoyed on the feeling that their vehicle''s abilities are challenged. Though its applications, importance and evolution has lead us into so many off-road sports.\n\nYour explanation covers one important aspect of second bead and that is to check fit of a gun and its redundancy in shooting (I presume) wings with more open chokes and smaller pellets along with skeet etc. It sure has no use there and no one will argues to that.\n\nTo add to the above usage, second bead can be extremely useful while shooting slugs at longer distances and BBs with tighter chokes. And these kind of shots are obviously and mostly on steady targets where there is a one time chance to shoot the target or else it vanishes. Thats where rifle-like shooting comes in the picture.\n\nComing back to my initial post about this, that probably triggered this informative discussion, I just highlighted this very same [b]additional benefit[/b] of second bead, assuming that the rest is known and practiced by our worthy fellows.', ''),

The higher the rate of de-celleration, more damage is the result .\nThere are many variables but to simplify, it depends whether the bullet hits a soft spot or dense muscles and bone also whether the bullet is soft point or hollow point etc etc. An expanding bullet will rapidly lose its velocity causing maximum damage.\nThe 9mm bullets usually fired are from 90 gr to 147 gr, and are shot at velocities ranging from 1500 ft /sec to 1080 ft/sec where as the TT bullet is 86 gr at velocity of 1410 ft/sec.( military load which are used over here )\nThe 9mm has about 20 to 25 % more energy and is a more lethal cartridge than the TT round. Both 9mm and .30 rds over penetrate a human torso when FMJs are used ; how ever when soft points are used the 30 round lacks authority in comparison with the 9mm.\nThese days more stress is on anti terror activity by forces around the world so over penetration is avoided  and quicker incapacitating rounds get priority; hence the move over to larger calibers like the 9mm and 10mm, the .40 and the .45 ACP ( in the anti terror role the special forces use expanding bullets like Corbons, Glasers, and Black Talon or Golden Saber etc etc) as the Geneva convention does not apply to anti terror ops) The military have to use FMJs as per the Geneva convention in regular wars[/QUOTE]\n \n@skeeter60\n\ndude thats the best explanation on this topic anyone has ever gave me. you have answered my question i asked so many people in last 3 years. kindly accept my humble regards and appreciation.', ''),

One of the many other reasons is hunting beyond the bag limits, hunting off season and banned timings ; like hunting rabbits with torches, motorcycles and cars at night.\n\nExcuse me for commenting that the airgunners are even bagging more doves and (banned) starlings than the shot gunners. A few years back I could see a lot of Ring necked doves in jhelum where as last year I could see dozens of them. However, I saw many air guns pointed towards these birds. How many of them have shooting license?\n\nIn USA and euorope the number of birds and animals is increasing because of conservation activities and implimentation of rules and regulations. \n\nLets do our part: "Follow the ethics of hunting."', ''),
(145317, ' Winchester 1887 was introduced by Winchester repeating arms in 1887. This legendary shotgun was designed by john browning, the famous gun designer. It was chambered for 12gauge shells but soon a model chambered for 10gauge ammo was introduced. Those models cant stand the modern ammo. This was 1st successful repeating shotgun standing up to the name of Winchester repeating arms as they were famous for their lever action style guns.\nThe reason of its fame was being a shotgun with 6shot capacity i believe. I dont think there was any other shotgun with capacity of more than 2 shells at that time. Now Lets wait for the seniors to second what i said or correct me:)\nNorinco has introduced the replica by the name of YL1887 i believe. This replica is designed for the modern ammo of 12gauge. An italian company is also making the same but i dont know the name of that company.\n\nYou must have seen this popular shotgun in many movies. Arnold used this shotgun in Terminator 2 the judgment day as his primary weapon.\n\nThe purpose of this thread is to discuss about the Leveraction [b]RIFLES[/b] like winchester 1866 and the modern lever action guns.

(145389, ' Sniper rifle software launched for iPod touch \n   \n \n\nA new application has been launched for the iPod touch to help gun users line up a clean shot at their target. \n\n\nThe BulletFlight app, which costs £6.99 to download from the iTunes store, has been developed by Runaway App to turn the iPod touch into a ballistics computer which the company says can provide "quick solutions in the field". \n\n\nUsers can mount their iPod touch to their rifle, and then use the iPod''s touch-screen to tap in details about the wind conditions, ammunition type, distance to the intended target and even the wind speed. \n\n\n"Unlike other apps, BulletFlight does not output information in table format," says the application''s iTunes page. "What it does do is dynamically give you the solution you need now to take that shot." \n\n\nThe application features built-in profiles for three weapons -- the M110 semi-automatic precision rifle, the KAC PDW, and the 14.5in SR16 rifle -- although users can add more weapons into the app. \n\n\n"Environmental calculations are based on the Sierra Bullet model," says the BulletFlight iTunes entry. "Up to five ballistic co-efficients with corresponding velocity thresholds may be used for each profile." \n\n\nBulletFlight is not the first shooting application for the iPhone and iPod touch -- that honour goes to iSnipe -- but it''s the latest in a long line of unusal apps for the devices, which have included simulated beer-pouring, a fart machine, and even "breathalysers".', ''),
(145390, ' AoA Everybody\n\nEven though the issue of mid bead has been well covered by Sir Skeeter60 and Sir Mian-50, kindly allow me offer to two cents on the subject.\n\n[b]MID BEAD SERVES NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. WHATEVER YOU CAN DO WITH IT, YOU CAN EASILY ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING WITHOUT IT.[/b]\n\nQuestion: how may sights/beads do you need inorder to properly sight in a shotgun? \nQuick answer: front sight (front bead) and rear sight (shooter''s eye), thats it!\n\nQuestion: does the mid bead offer anything when using slugs?\nQuick answer: No!. if you want accuracy (with slugs its a remote possibility to begin with) you must use rifle/slug sights or a scope.\n\nQuestion: is there any disadvantage associated with the mid bead?\nQuick answer: yes!. the first disadvantage in my humble opinion is that it is distracting to the shooter. second, it slows down the mounting process. too many things to align before you can pull the trigger (low gun shoot).  a properly fitted gun should not have mounting issues to begin with.\n\nQuestion: is there any advantage?\nQuick answer: yes! but only when the shooter prefers to pre-mount (in my humble opinion). you mount the gun, check the mount by ensuring figure 8 configuration then call the bird. in my humble opinion, this pre-mount thingy and ensuring figure 8 configuration is only for trap where the bird is going away from the shooter.\n\nThis is just my humble opinion, your mileage may vary.\n\nRegards.', ''),

While in deliberate shooting he''s more concerned about ''that particular shot at a particular moment'' which he tries to anticipate, hence shooting away from the POA!\n\nJust my humble opinion, I maybe wrong.

(145554, ' Slam Fires on M1 Garands, M1A''s, FN-LAR''s, SAT-48''s and M1 Carbines\n\nThe following information is based on an article in the October, 1983 edition of American Rifleman entitled "The Mysterious Slam-Fire." Because this is so important to shooters of the above weapons, Springfield Armory sent a reprint of that article. Since many shooters do not get to see this information, Combat Arms is providing the salient or main points to consider.\n\nSlam fires occur when the bolt closes and, without the trigger being pulled, the round that was chambered fires and destroys the gun. An analysis of these problems seems to indicate that:\n\n1. Commercial primers are more sensitive than military primers. When the bolt slams closed, the free floating firing pin will contact the primer. Normally this should not be a problem. However, if the round is a reload and the primer is incorrectly seated, that may cause the slam firing to occur.\n\n2. If you are a reloader, another problem to watch for is an improperly sized case or one in which the bullet is not seated to the correct depth, making the overall case length too long. A properly sized case will enter the chamber under finger pressure. Never fire a round that fits tightly in the chamber. Never fire reloads in a gun that is under warranty. It voids the warranty!\n\n3. On guns that have had their hammer hooks stoned (match grade firearms), if the stoning was excessive, that can contribute to the slam fire. People stone the hammer hooks to remove excess trigger creep. It should never be attempted except by a qualified armorer or gunsmith. Also use caution in modifying the ejector, extractor or extractor spring. If the ejector is too short or the extractor spring too weak, the bolt cushioning is lessened and consequently, bolt momentum to the head of the cartridge case is increased. Again, this sort of work should be performed by a qualified armorer or gunsmith.\n\n4. Watch for impending case separation if you are reloading. Look for "stretch marks" on the cases. These indicate an impending case separation. Destroy these cases by crushing them flat with a hammer. Also watch for a bright high pressure ring forming ahead of the case web.\n\n5. Remove the firing fin occasionally and clean the firing pin recesses in the bolt. This prevents the firing pin from sticking.\n\n6. Lubricate with Break-Free CLP (TM). This is one of the finest cleaners, lubricants and preservatives ever made. If you do not know how to properly clean your weapon, then do not be shy. Contact your local gun shop and hire someone there to teach you how to do it properly.\n\n7. Always wear shooting glasses! You have been given one set of eyes in this life. If the gun literally explodes while you are holding it, you could lose your eyesight. Safety glasses are very inexpensive ($4.95 to $29.95).\n\nAs you can see, the biggest factor affecting slam fires is reloaded ammunition. In my humble opinion, based on being a shooter and gun store owner, not one reloader in 100 knows how to properly reload. The biggest reason is that the remaining 99 out of 100 do not carefully study the reloading manual and follow instructions. There are many ways to reload and only one or two correct ways.\n\n\np.S \nI AM UNABLE TO POST LINK AS THIS INFO IS VERY ANCIENT AND WEBLINK IS NO LONGER AVAILANLE', ''),

It breaks up with normal 9mm ammo and Mk1Z ( low power )was made specially for this 2nd WWar military surplus given to us by Uncle Sam in the honey moon era of the 50s and 60s.\nIt had an alloy slide with a steel breech. With normal 9mm rds the slides would crack so the poor 1Z was made.\n Once these relics were done away with the 2z was stamped on the  normal 9mm ammo which confirms to the SAAMI standards.\nThe 2z is a normal round with slight variations in the manufacture according to the year of manufacture like between 1984, 1990 1996, 2000, 2008,  2009  2010 etc which is normal and within SAAMI specs.

Without trying to sound emotional, i will tell you one thing in all my exprience, the best way to train a dog is to spend time with him or her. Dogs are very intelligent creatures, they pick up things very quickly. I used to have a dog, a German shepard, who would take the cow i would buy for slaughter for a walk, since he had seen me do it for a couple of years. It was quiet amusing to see a dog holding the rope of an animal almost 10 times his size and walking it around the neighbourhood.

Well, as far as the brand/make/finesse of the item is concerned, I''m attaching a few more close ups below.\n\nAs far as the review/ "zero retention" is concerned, I shall post on this as soon as I try it out [b]practically[/b], Inshallah.  :) \n\nBut let me just point out a few observations/expectations of mine on this so far untried issue: \n\n1) [b]Make[/b]:\n\n Well, it''s an item from[b] Vector Optics[/b], China, and having been in personal contact with this maker since long, as well as with other Chinese manufacturers, I''ve the impression that Vector makes some of the finest optical items in China, pretty many of their products are being retailed on the U.S.A sites, though with a different "[b]logo[/b]" attachment.\n\n2) [b]Zero Retention[/b]:\n\nWell, now this is an important and interesting feature indeed, I agree, yet let me put it this way: even [b]If[/b] there''s a minor deviation from the zero setting of the device - when shooting out of a .45 - I feel it doesn''t change much, if the bullet lands an inch, even a few inches, off the absolute bull area of the initial setting. Why? Well, simply because this is not supposed to be an item for routine/range/practice shooting. For that, course you''ll need to improve your own sight, and that part of the biz is [b]indispensable[/b].  \n\nThe use of lasers, in my view, apart from getting the fun out of it, course, is ensuring a [i]reasonably[/i] well placed shot without having to aim [i]carefully[/i], especially during a[b] night scene[/b] -[i]an offender fleeing, moving, after having caused you some serious troubles/assault and you need a leg shot perhaps[/i] - and being able to do that [i]reasonably[/i] well, especially from short bareled compacts with the tendency to shoot [b]low[/b], just by pointing/aiming your gun, kind of fun plinking, from any holding position, not necessarily from a weaver position, etc. Moreover, in my view, these items are more of "track n'' shoot" not a defensive item as such, coz in any [b]plausible and sudden action[/b], you''ll never have time enough to turn it on.   :)  \n\nThough, I''m sure, in any such eventuality, and may God forbid it, with a few follow up shots in the same torso area, the BG will be out, [b]before[/b] the zero retention is! Thus, it''s a [b]one time[/b] item, basically, you don''t use it regularly.\n\nFinally, and quite [i]ironically[/i], let me say, I''ve never heard of anybody having outdone a BG, just because of a [b]laser[/b]!  :lol: \n\n[b]All that movie crap is nonsense[/b]. And even if special agents do use such items, outside the Hollywood studios, I''m sure quality of items is quite different, most likely, the kind of "unavailable- to- public" [b]IR[/b] items (Infrared emission of beam), so that your own position is not declared.  ;) \n\nSo, to me, it''s just kind of completion or utilization of that tiny "[b]tactical[/b]" rail/cracks/ambidextrous deep lines on both sides of the frame, just below the muzzle.

(145810, ' Hmmm. Actually you are right. If the slam fire occurs due to a stuck (in the forward position) firing pin, then this might be the case. An out of battery detonation may occur.\nEven though, its highly unlikely. When a round is being fed in to the chamber, it points slightly upwards and the primer is pointing downwards to help with the feeding. The primer may only come in contact with the PIN when the round it almost seated and its angle is parallel to the firing PIN.\n\notherwise the forward motion of the floating PIN will probably occur when the bolt stops in the forward position and the firing PIN is accelerated forward due to the inertia.\nComing back to the out of battery firing. Lets consider the fixed firing PIN, open bolt type weapons. How do they function? I think the bolt slams forward hitting the primer with its fixed firing PIN. How do they prevent out of battery firing with this mechanism? What about API weapons?', ''),

(146174, ' There can be only one top rifle cartridge of the 20th century, and Field Editor Layne Simpson has a handle on what it is. Here is his selection along with its 11 runners-up.\n\nThe greatest centerfire cartridge of the 20th century? Even though the answer to that question should have come to me as easily as falling off a greased log, I found it difficult to single out one among so many great ones. An early example among great cartridges is the .300 Savage, which offered original .30-06 performance in a package small enough to cycle through popular rifles such as the Savage 99 and Remington 81. But is it the greatest of the great? Hardly. Then we have other candidates. Although ignored to death by American hunters, the .307 Winchester is a great cartridge simply because it squeezes .300 Savage performance from America’s favorite deer rifle, the Winchester 94. But that alone does not place it among the list of top candidates for it is now a dying cartridge. And what about the .22-250? It began life as one of the most popular wildcats ever created, was available in Browning rifles before Remington started factory loading it, and is now one of our two most popular varmint cartridges. Great though it is, the .22-250 has yet to earn a big shot at the No. 1 position like other cartridges. \n\n\nThe .17 Remington is a favorite I hated to eliminate from my short list, mainly because it is uniquely American and so much fun to shoot. Then we have others like the .22 Hornet (my first varmint cartridge), the .35 Remington (my first store-bought deer cartridge), and the .225 Winchester (which accounted for my first sub-minute-of-angle group). Sentimental fellow that I am, I could very easily have listed either of those among the greatest of the great. Other favorites I hated to weed out are the .280 Remington (almost as good as the .270), 6mm Remington (actually better than the .243), .257 Roberts (better than the 6mm or .243), .25-06 (I used it a lot when it was a wildcat), 7x57mm Mauser (which will do anything the 7mm-08 will do), 7mm-08 Remington (which will do anything the 7x57mm Mauser will do), and the .416 Weatherby Magnum (my favorite cartridge for the big stuff of Africa). But they too had to go. As for new cartridges on the scene, the 7mm STW and .300 Remington Ultra Mag might eventually earn enough stripes to be included in such a list by another writer at the end of the 21st century, but as I write this neither has proven capable of weathering the test of time.\n\n\nAs it turned out, I simply could not come up with the single greatest cartridge without at least mentioning those that have given it a run for its money in not only popularity but usefulness as well. So I took the easy way out by naming not only the cartridge of the century but, as they say in beauty contests, its 11 runners-up as well. Here, then, in the order of their introduction are all too brief comments on what I consider to be the fantastic dozen of the 20th century, with the 11 runners-up first and the winner last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.375 Holland & Holland Magnum.\n\nI chose the .375 H&H Magnum as one of the top dozen of the 20th century simply because few other cartridges do so many things so well. It is just powerful enough to handle game too nasty for smaller cartridges, yet it is not ridiculously overpowered for nondangerous North American game such as elk and moose. I also chose it because the level of recoil it generates represents about the upper limit most hunters can tolerate. Even though the .375 H&H Magnum was introduced by Holland & Holland in 1925, most American hunters ignored it due to the high cost of imported rifles chambered for it. But that changed for the better in 1937 when Winchester added the chambering to its list of options for the Model 70 rifle. When loaded with good bullets and fired in an accurate rifle, this old English cartridge is capable of remarkable accuracy. It’s good too; I would not hesitate to hunt any big-game animal presently walking the face of the earth with the .375 H&H Magnum.\n\n\n\n.270 Winchester\n\nWhat can I say about the .270 Winchester that was not said far more eloquently by Jack O’Connor, the greatest firearms writer of the 20th century? The most famous and by far the most successful full-length offspring of the .30-06 Springfield, the .270 had it all back in 1925 when it was introduced and still has it all today. Need a flat-shooting, mild-recoiling, super-accurate cartridge for shooting deer-size game at long range? The .270 loaded with a good 130-grain bullet fills the bill with room to spare. Heading out west for an elk or moose hunt? Don’t overlook the .270 loaded with a premium-grade bullet weighing 150 grains. Does your shoulder scream out in protest each time you squeeze the trigger on that new .409 Pooper-Scooper Magnum? If so, relief in the form of a .270-caliber rifle is no further away than your friendly gunshop.\n\n\n\n.220 Swift\n\nExceeding 4000 feet per second with a rifle bullet seemed about as far out of reach as man’s first step on the moon back in the 1930s, but Winchester accomplished the impossible in 1935 by introducing the great .220 Swift. Loaded with a 48-grain bullet at the previously unheard of velocity of 4110 fps, the Swift made plenty of noise, shot flatter than a moonbeam, and electrocuted a varmint in its tracks. And if that alone wasn’t enough, the new cartridge was extremely accurate in the Winchester Model 70 rifle. During its heyday the Swift took its licks from critics who were obviously jealous of its success, but those of us who use it today recognize it for what it is—the greatest varmint cartridge of all time. True, the .22-250 is more popular, but it simply follows the trail blazed over half a century ago by the .220 Swift.\n\n\n\n\n\n.300 Weatherby Magnum\n\nRoy Weatherby didn’t invent the .30-caliber magnum cartridge; among Americans that honor goes to a fellow by the name of Charles Newton. Weatherby did, however, cause more hunters to want to own .30 magnum rifles than anyone before or since his time. More important to the success of his company, those hunters wanted Weatherby rifles in .300 Magnum. I saw my first Weatherby rifle while still in high school and swore then and there that I would someday own one, and sure enough I eventually did. I’m sure many other youngsters my age shared the same dream. Roy’s .300 Magnum with its distinctive double-radius shoulder has long been and probably always will be the belted magnum by which all others of its caliber are measured. You can say what you want about its recoil and muzzle blast, but no one who has used the .300 Weatherby Magnum on big game will deny that the hunt almost always ends quickly just after the first trigger squeeze.\n\n\n.222 Remington\n\nA brainchild of Remington’s Mike Walker, the .222 was made possible by the introduction of the Remington Model 722 bolt-action rifle. That combination, the .222 and the 722, ruled the accuracy roost among varmint shooters during the 1950s, and the little cartridge even went on to absolutely dominate registered benchrest competition until the 6mm PPC came along in 1975. In addition, the .222 eventually spawned the .17 Remington, .221 Fireball, .222 Remington Magnum, .223 Remington, and the European 5.6x50mm Magnum, making it one of the more prolific cartridges introduced during the 20th century. Today, the .223 is more popular, but when all is said and done it really won’t do a lot that can’t be done about as well with the .222 Remington. If ever I decide to build the six most accurate rifles in the world, one of them will be chambered for the .222 Remington.\n\n\n\n.308 Winchester\n\nThe .308 Winchester, or 7.62x51mm NATO as it is also called, was not the first high-intensity centerfire cartridge designed for short-action rifles; that distinction goes to the .300 Savage. The .308 was, however, the first cartridge of its kind to enjoy worldwide popularity. On several occasions I have hunted moose in Sweden and am always surprised to see how many of the local hunters are armed with rifles in .308 Winchester. Among calibers larger than 6mm, the .308 is by far the most popular short-action big-game cartridge among hunters worldwide. The .308 has also fathered a rather large clan of offspring with names like .243 Winchester, .260 Remington, 7mm-08 Remington, and .358 Winchester. Probably the best thing to be said of the .308 is it is capable of phenomenal accuracy; it is possibly the single most inherently accurate cartridge of a caliber larger than 6mm ever designed.\n\n\n\n\n\n.243 Winchester\n\nThe .243 Winchester was not the first cartridge of its caliber, but it was the first cartridge to really put the caliber on the map among varmint shooters and deer hunters. The .243 plays its dual role as a combination varmint/big-game cartridge like few other cartridges are capable of, and it possesses incredible accuracy potential. Mild manners combined with energy delivery quite adequate for game up to the size of whitetail deer and pronghorn antelope make the .243 as close to ideal as we are likely to ever get for those who are sensitive to recoil. The 6mm Remington (alias .244 Remington) might be just a tad better and the .240 Weatherby most definitely is, but neither has enjoyed anywhere near the popularity of the .243 Winchester.\n\n\n\n\n.458 Winchester Magnum\n\nThe .458 Winchester was America’s first factory-loaded elephant cartridge. Prior to its introduction in 1956, American hunters who ventured to Africa either used American-built rifles in .375 H&H (which some considered a bit small for elephant and such), a custom-built rifle chambered for a wildcat such as the .450 Watts, or they bought an expensive English-built rifle chambered for a cartridge of English design. Then along came the Model 70 in .458 Magnum, which not only duplicated the performance of the ever-popular .470 Nitro Express, it cost but a fraction of the price of a British double in that caliber. The .458 Winchester went on to become the most popular backup cartridge among African professional hunters, and to this day it is the dangerous game cartridge by which all others are judged.\n\n\n\n\n.338 Winchester Magnum\n\nI like the .338 Winchester Magnum but not quite as much as the .375 H&H Magnum. It is a good cartridge, but I’m not sure it is a lot better than one of the .300 magnums loaded with a 200-grain bullet. The .338 shoots flat but not quite as flat as one of the 7mm magnums. The .338 hits hard downrange, but it also hits hard back behind the recoil pad. Through the years I have heard all those statements used to describe the .338 Winchester Magnum, but the fact remains that it has enjoyed and continues to enjoy more popularity among big-game hunters than all other medium-bore cartridges combined. The last time I looked at ammunition sales reports from Winchester, Remington, and Federal, the .338 ranked 10th among all big-game cartridges, reason enough to include it among the 12 greatest centerfire rifle cartridges of the 20th century. \n\n\n\n\n\n7mm Remington Magnum \n\nThe 7mm Remington Magnum and I go back to 1962, the year Remington introduced it, so it has long been one of my favorite cartridges. Other cartridges of the same caliber came before Remington’s version, but all combined did not cause as much excitement among American hunters. In fact, prior to its introduction, most Americans ignored 7mm cartridges. Not so for the new one from Remington. For several years after it was introduced, the demand for Model 700 rifles chambered for the “Big Seven” far outpaced Remington’s ability to produce them. Even today, over three decades after its introduction, only the .30-30, .30-06, .270, and .308 are more popular among big-game hunters. Why the 7mm Remington Magnum enjoys such popularity is no big mystery—it shoots flatter and hits harder than the .30-06 but generates only slightly more recoil. It is truly one of the 20th century’s greats.\n\n6mm PPC\n\nChances are the 6mm PPC has never killed a single deer, and it most definitely ranks near the bottom of the heap among varmint hunters. It doesn’t shoot as flat as a banjo string, and it doesn’t deliver gobs of energy downrange, make a lot of noise, or pound one’s shoulder to a pulp. The 6mm PPC is anything but cheap to shoot; last time I looked, cases were selling at 75 cents each, and they still had to be fine-tuned before being used. Even though Americans Lou Palmisano and Ferris Pindell created the little cartridge, it is foreign to most American shooters. On top of all that, while the 6mm PPC has been around for over 20 years not a single American ammo manufacturer has chosen to load it. What the 6mm PPC has done and continues to do is break more world accuracy records in registered benchrest shooting than any other cartridge, and it shows no sign of slowing down. When firearms correspondents of the future write about such things, the 6mm PPC will be mentioned most often as the accuracy cartridge of the 20th century.\n\n\nAnd The Winner Is... The .30-06 Springfield\n\nThen we come to the .30-06 Springfield, my pick as the greatest rifle cartridge of the 20th century .Before you disagree, take a look at its track record. For starters, the .30-06 was the primary battle cartridge of American military forces from its introduction in 1903 until it was replaced by the 7.62mm NATO in 1954. That’s over half a century of military duty. During that time the United States and its allies won the two greatest wars in the history of modern mankind, and while they would likely have done so had the .30-06 not been around, the cartridge played a key role nevertheless. Long before the old soldier retired from military duty it was enjoying tremendous popularity among hunters and target shooters. Today, the .30-06 is No. 1 in sales among all big-game cartridges with the major ammunition manufacturers, and it is seldom out of the top five most popular chamberings among builders of bolt-action rifles. The grand old cartridge has long been available in all types of rifles: bolt actions, slide actions, single shots, autoloaders, and even a few lever actions. A great abundance of factory loadings are available not only from U.S. manufacturers but from those in other countries as well. Federal alone, as an example, offers almost two-dozen different loadings of the .30-06 Springfield with bullet weights ranging from 125 to 220 grains. Handloaders who load the cartridge have a great variety of brands, styles, and weights of bullets from which to choose, and dozens are suitable for this grand old cartridge. The popularity of the .30-06 is worldwide; it accounts for a big chunk of sales among many foreign manufacturers of sporting ammunition, and any foreign rifle manufacturer who is anybody (and even some who aren’t) offer the .30-06 chambering. The .30-06 got a head start on its competition by being adopted by the US Military, same as the .45-70 Government, .30-40 Krag, .308 Winchester, and .223 Remington. Today, it is a benchmark by which big-game cartridge performa compared. \n\nSo there you have the greatest cartridge of the 20th century along with its 11 runners-up. I’m sure everyone won’t agree with all of my picks, but that was one of the great things about 20th-century America—we could disagree and still be friends.\n\nCartridge Year of Introduction\n\n.30-06 Springfield,                                         1906\n\n.375 H&H Magnum,                                     1912\n\n.270 Winchester,                                            1925\n\n.220 Swift,                                                       1935\n\n.300 Weatherby Magnum,                            1948\n\n.222 Remington,                                             1950\n\n.308 Winchester,                                            1952\n\n.243 Winchester,                                            1955\n\n.458 Winchester Magnum,                           1956\n\n.338 Winchester, Magnum,                          1958\n\n7mm Remington Magnum,                          1962\n\n6mm PPC,                                                      1975', ''),

(146312, ' Wow, another discussion on POF 1 & 2Z  :lol: \n\nI think Skeeter sahib has amply clarified the observation raised by CS brother. I can only add that who so ever than Col was, he was not aware of the details otherwise he would have not made this comment. Following few posts would clarify the things further    :) \n\n\n\n[quote=Gilani][quote=BloodBath]Salams All !\n\nIn my humble opinion there is a problem with the 2Z POF round. I have scrapped three P7m13 pistols just bacuase over prolonged use they could not sustain the unusually high chamber pressures. I grade P7s as one of the best ever pistols.\nThe round is designed to cycle the MP5 bolt and carrier which takes a lot more rearward push than that of pistols. If the rounds were good for pistols, POF would have never ever had two varients under parallel production.\nMost of the modern pistols as mentioned by a dear fellow member can take thousands of rounds of P2Z but that comes at a cost. There is a definate difference in the propellent mix and the jerk one feels by firing these different varients.\nI will not recommend it to be used in pistols and please dont ever try to use them in darra made pistols , have seen the slide of one come right off.\nRegards\nBloodBath[/quote]\n\nBloodBath brother, thanks for your comments. :)\n\nPOF website quotes following data:\n\n[b]Cal [/b]                                [b]Base marking[/b]      [b]Mean velocity[/b]     [b]Accuracy M.F.M.[/b]       [b]Wt of Ctgs[/b]\n9 mm Ball Parabellum  	      9mm 2Z  	             395 m/s       76.2 mm at 15.24 m         12.57 grams  	\n9 mm Walther Pistol  	      9 mm 1Z  	             341 m/s       254x152mm at 25m         12.56 	\n\n[url]http://www.pof.gov.pk/products.htm#[/url]\n\nThis clearly shows that the difference in MV is 54 m/s. The chamber pressure generated by both the ctgs is not given. Obviously, 2Z generates more chamber pressure than 1Z. \n\nNow why POF has an ammo specially made for "Walther'' pistol. This is because Walther P38, which has an alloy slide, could not take the pressure generated by 2Z and slides of many Walther pistols cracked (this happened in 60s). Hence Walthers were fed with 1Z which generated comparatively less pressure. That was the era when most 9mm pistols, though otherwise very well constructed, were not designed to fire high pressure rounds. But during mid 70s and 80s onwards, we saw a lot of high pressure rounds of different types being introduced commercially and accordingly, the slides, chambers, springs and other parts of most modern pistols were designed to fire these loads. \n\nNow the question arises " Is POF2Z a safe ammo to be used with all 9 mm pistols?".\n\nSkeeter60 sahib has fired hundreds of thousands (yes, many lacks) of 2Z with his Glocks, CZ75 and Sig P226 for well over two decades. He chronographed 2Z and found it in the range of 1250-1290 ft / sec (381-390 m/s). This is less than many commercially available US made +P and +P+ loads which we otherwise use in our handguns. Skeeter60 sahib told me that normally he would change his Glock after firing 50-60 k rounds. I don''t exactly remember but I would have also fired well over 20K 2Z rounds from different handguns in the last two decades or more. With few guns, I fired thousands of 2Z. We never had a problem with 2Z. Off course there is a difference in recoil but except a few low quality handguns, all modern guns are designed to take it.        \n\nPOF2Z should preferably be avoided with very old handguns, handguns with alloy slide and handguns of weak or un-confirmed make. Not only POF2Z, most other JHPs and other high pressure ammos should also not be fired from such guns. But with guns like Glock, CZ75 (and clones), Sig (and clones), Baikal MP446, CZ999, Taurus PT92/99, Beretta 92FS, Stoeger Couger, most chinese pistols etc, there should not be a problem. However, a shooter himself is the best judge to see what type of handgun he is using and should accordingly select the ammo. :) \n\nAnd sorry to hear about your P7s but could there be some other reason also? And are you talking about earlier models of P7 which were inducted in SSG in lates 60s / early 70s?? \n\nregards[/quote]\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/post.php?tid=4055&qid=137669[/url]\n\n\n\n\n[quote=Gilani][quote=SA][quote=Gilani]Kamran sahib, I have fired thousands of rounds of this ammo over the years with different weapons. I found it one of the most accurate ammos available in Pakistan. Groups are very consistent. A little on the hotter side.:)\nregards \n[/quote]\n\nAre you referring to 2Z or 1Z Gilani Sb ?[/quote]\n\nSA sahib, didn''t see this post. I normally use POF 2Z, the ammo that is used in MP5 also, though I also use Mk 1Z quite often. Mk2Z is slightly hotter than POF1Z or POF Mk11Z. After having fired tens of thousands of rounds of 2Z from different pistols, I can say that there is no problem. Most modern pistols are designed for firing +P ammos and there is no problem in firing 2Z with them. POF2Z, however, should be avoided in old models like Walther P38 etc, specially the models with alloy slides. :)[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Skeeter60]Mr Gilani\n\nI second you.\nThe 2 Z and 1 Z  I only heard of in 1969 when we had some Sten Machine Carbines and Walther P38 Pistols which had alloy slides and a  steel breach  plug. As these faded away I never heard of the damn 1 Z again. There were some SMCs till 1982 but then all were junked.\nNever heard of 1 Z; only on the forum I hear about it I either did not notice  or there never was any 1Z made after 1984 to my humble knowledge  only the experts at our forum seem to be acquainted with it. The 2Z is not +P as having miked the 115 grain er at 1250 I personally do not consider it + P as so many companies are giving same ballistics, the US 9mm (mily ) is 124 grains  at the velocity of 1300 FPS and giving a hefty 485 ft lbs of energy compared to ours at around 398 ft lbs . The US 9mm is being fired in the fragile Beretta  ( every  6000 rounds the slide is inspected for cracks ).\nBy the way the pressure is supposed to be at a  constant value and it has to be kept  with in  the same  safe level. \n\nBy using a larger amount of  slower propellant higher velocities are achieved, this slow powder gives a more sustained  pressure curve  thereby accelerating the bullet to a higher velocity. (peak pressure remains same )\n\nThough the pressure does not increase beyond the SAAMI limits the force of BOLT THRUST is much higher and a only a strong and well designed pistol will thrive on a steady diet of such ammo without any damage to its frame, slide or the shooters handsome face.[/quote]\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/post.php?tid=4055&qid=137026[/url]', ''),

Took it for target shooting and let go of nearly 200 rds in quick time. dint skip a single one and never lost balance. kept all the holes within a one foot radius on the target on semi auto rapid fire without bothering to zero. then my niece who is an amateur shot off 3 mags and did the same.\nnext i started the zeroing process and within 6 shots it was done. Then I began competitive shooting and managed 2inch groups without a scoop at 100y. Used Federal high velocity bulls. It is heavy for a .22 but I have always preferred my guns to be a little on the heavier side. Gives me better balance. The only drawback, and I presume a big one. Very hard to smartly dismantle and clean throughly at home. Plasticky and toy like but very pleasing to shoot. Still looking for a remington or a winchester .22lr.\nOne thing I wanted to make clear.

I called Fayaz Malik today after getting his outfit''s number from Hatsan (Turkey) company. They recommended that I deal with him instead of anybody else. I was looking for Hatsan Optima O/U shotgun.\n\nI Introduced myself very courteously. I even gave him my full designation and complete description of the office that I am holding. I told him what I am looking for and where I got his number. to my shock and surprise, he said "I do not know if its really you cause on telephone anybody can pretend to be anybody, I will only know for sure when you''ll come to my shop".\n\nThen I replied "Brother! if I call you from my office number and fax you my request on Govt. letter head via official fax number then would you believe thats its me, besides what does that have to do with me being a customer?"\n\nAnyway, by this time, the excitement had already turned into disappointment. I asked about the said shotgun and he replied "we do not have "hatsan" shotguns, we only stock "HAASTAAN" shotguns". I replied, Sir! the name is Hatsan and I believe its the same shotgun I''m looking for. he said " NO! we only have HAASTAAN and Thats it" and hung up the phone.\n\nI believe this kind of a rude behavior is uncalled for and we should sever all ties with this guy. if he cannot extend courtesy and respect to his prospective customers then I guess he (Fayaz Malik) does not need/deserve to have any new customers. as far as I am concerned, I am ringing up all my buddies to get this guy''s name on the "DONT DO BUSINESS WITH" list. and its about time he gets HIS IMPORT QUOTA RE-CONSIDERED.

(146674, ' Here''s interesting explaination \n[quote]\n[b]What a gun is fired straight up into the air, this is what happens:[/b]\n\nThe bullet leaves the gun at e.g 3000 feet per second.  There are two things now that slow the bullet down as it goes up.  One is gravity - which slows the bullet 32 feet per second every second.  If this were all that slowed it down, then after 10 seconds, the bullet would still be going (3000 - 320), or 2680 feet per second.  This is not even close to the true velocity after 10 seconds,  because air friction is slowing the bullet also.  That friction is much greater while the bullet is going fast.  In the first second, it may slow the bullet by 1000 feet per second.  Then in the second second, maybe another 500, and then less and less, until finally, the gravitational slowing is more significant than the friction.  The bullet will continue to slow down until it stops at the top.\n\n[b]Now let''s talk about when the bullet heads back down:[/b]\n\nThe same two forces are present, but now the gravity part is speeding up the bullet - friction is still trying to slow it down.  Gravity will be speeding up the bullet 32 feet per second every second, but friction will be increasing more and more as the bullet speeds up, and this friction will subtract from that 32.  There is a certain velocity when the friction is equal to the gravity in the opposite direction.  At this point, the frictional acceleration is 32 feet per second every second upward (or -32), while the gravitational acceleration is 32 feet per second every second downward (+32).  From now on, the bullet will have no acceleration at all (32 - 32 = 0).  When this happens, the velocity of the bullet is called its "terminal velocity."  The bullet will continue at the same velocity until it hits the ground or some object.\n\nThis terminal velocity is different depending mostly on two things.  1. The density of the thing that is falling.  2. The shape of the thing that is falling.  Bullets are very dense (usually lead), and they have a shape to allow relatively low friction.  The terminal velocity of a feather may be only 2 feet per second because of its shape and density, but the terminal velocity of a bullet could be 300 or 400 feet per second.  This could be about 300 miles per hour.\n\n[b]the reason people get injured or killed[/b] \n\n1. That 400 feet per second is much slower than the 3000 feet per second that the bullet had when first fired. If you or a friend argued that the bullet is going slower on the way down, then you or that friend was correct on the physics.\n\n2. It is still dangerous.  A three hundred mile per hour piece of lead can still do harm.  There is no question that it is not as effective as a bullet fired directly at something.  The bullet that is fired at something has another very important feature, however, a feature the bullet fired into the air does not have.  It was aimed - there was an intended target.  The bullet fired into the air falls randomly and could hit anything.  If it hit someone right on top of the head, it''s possible that it could kill.  It''s going about three times as fast as a professionally hit tennis serve, and it''s much smaller than a tennis ball, and harder - more penetrating.  When you triple the speed, the energy goes up nine times (it''s proportional to the square of the speed), and I''ll bet there''s no-one who wants to be hit by a tennis ball with nine times the energy of a fast serve.  Then, because the bullet is small and hard, it is hundreds of times more penetrating than that tennis ball would be.  Put a tennis ball in your palm and put twenty pounds on top of it.  No problem.  But now put the blade of a screw-driver on your palm and put twenty pounds on that.  That will hurt.  Same twenty pounds - smaller cross section - more penetrating. \n[/quote]\n \nTest done in lab with pig skull(approx. same density as a adult) show then fracturing at 170 miles per hour so 300 miles per is enough to cause a death.', ''),

Generally quality weapons will have firing pin blocks which prevent the firing pin from moving forward unless the Rifle /pistol bolt/slide is locked and the trigger pulled fully back. \nFiring pin blocks exist on on free floating firing pins as well but some do not like  the Dragunov, the Dragunovs blow up when US hunting ammo and reloads are used as the original military round has a very hard primer.\nSome times when we slam a bolt forward on an auto rifle and then extract the loaded round we will find a small primer indentation on the primer, it is not enough to fire the round; but Murphy said "If anything can go wrong, it will ".\nThere was once a problem with POF 12 gauge cartridges where the primer was seated too deeply and Beretta auto shot guns were not firing it. Some Homeopathic engineers had the firing pins elongated ( it straight away voids the warranty) and can result in a slam fire. The Beretta has a lovely safety feature, the pin can only go forward when the tilt locking is complete, in that case the gun can still slam fire but will not self destruct.\nAlways point a gun in a safe direction', ''),

(146713, ' O.K, guyz, in addition to my previous post, one more interesting feature of the laser sight, I experienced just this morning, while playing around a bit with the newly mounted PT 145.\n\nIn an attempt to check out my zero setting of the laser - basically to check out alignment with the sights of the gun - I pointed at different objects with an empty gun within my house, both small and large objects, at variable distances. I noted that I had managed the laser beam and the iron sights quite aligned.  :cool: \n\nYet, in doing this, I noticed one more quality/benefit in playing around with a laser mounted handgun:\n                 \n              Heck, [b]it''s quite difficult to keep the aim still[/b]! \n \nSomething you just can''t get the feel of with traditional sights, coz with the laser aimed, and a red dot flashing on target, you can see even the minimal trembling/shaking/moving of your hands, and you start to realize some of the causes of your "off-the-target" misses during sessions:\n\n                1) Your holding position/ standing stance\n                2) Your[b] BREATHING[/b]!\n  \nHeck, it was quite of an effort, with the beneficial help of the laser, that I managed holding the aim still.\nThe secret was simply:\n\n1) Traditional double handed positioning of the hands, where you just overlap one hand over the other, kind of extra support only, [b]just doesn''t work[/b]! The hands tremble too much.\n\nYou actually have to - if a right handed shooter - "wrap up your right hand" with the left one, in such a way that the[b] left palm[/b] is kind of a way "pushing" against the side of your gun towards the right, with the "venus" mount of your left palm onto the center of your left side grip, in a "stabilizing" manner, whilst your [b]right hand[/b] is forcing the gun to be straight from the [b]other[/b] side, thus getting kind of an "equilibrium" of pressures from both sides. Trust me it works wonders!  :o \n\n[b]Both left handed thumb and right sided index finger should be kinda parallel, resting on both sides of the gun, just below the slide[/b], and right sided thumb should be overlapping the left handed one in a tight cross.\n\n2) Stance should be 1 step forward on the left leg, arms should not be held straight, but both elbows should be slightly bent, and without being an expert here, I guess it''s called the "Weaver" style or so.  :rolleyes: \n  \n3) Shortly before the fire, [b]HOLD[/b] your breath!  \nI never concentrated on these things, I may be wrong somewhere with the above, only experts can comment, [b]but heck this was how I managed the red laser dot still[/b]!\n\nThus, you can also use such accessories for improving your shooting skills, even without any fires shot! Furthermore, dry firing with a laser on would prove more beneficial than dry firing in air, you can check your movement at the moment of pulling of the trigger in both DA and SA mode this way, by monitoring the movement of the red laser dot, hence practice in holding the gun firm at the moment of fire.

(146715, ' The world''s 20 best shotguns\n\n\nIt is a difficult task to name the world''s top 20 shotguns. \n\nFirst one must ask by what criteria are they to be judged? \n\n\nDesign excellence, aesthetic quality, overall form, reliability, decorative detail, integrity of materials, value for money and shooting performance might all be considered. Practically speaking, any gun listed must remain in production, too. \n\nThere are certain other questions: what has been especially significant or innovative? What cannot be left out? What really ''sings'' when you shoot it? \n\nThe experience of using the guns detailed (with a couple of exceptions), and the overall impression that they have left with regard to shooting characteristics and manufacturing quality have been of paramount importance in compiling the list. \n\nThe conclusions here are subjective, of course, but they have come under scrutiny on and off the shooting field from gun-trade professionals and experienced sportsmen. The list presented below is in a more-or-less chronological order so time-lines of \ndevelopment may be identified by those readers who may be interested. The ordering of guns is not an indication of relative merit. \n\n\nNAME OF THE GUNS\n\n\nPurdey side-by-side self-opening sidelock\n\nHolland & Holland Royal side-by-side\n\nBoss sidelock side-by-side\nRound action side-by-side as made by David McKay Brown and Dickson & MacNaughton\n\nRemanufactured Stephen Grant side lever 12-bore \nBoss over-and-under (patented 1909)\nPurdey Woodward over-and-under\nBrowning Superposed over-and-under \nBeretta 68 series over-and-under\nPerazzi over-and-under\nKemen\nDavid McKay Brown round action over-and-under\nFabbri over-and-under\nHolland & Holland Royal over-and-under\nBosis side-by-side\nAyA No 1 Deluxe - English finish\n\n\nWilliam & Son side-by-side sidelock\n\n\nCaesar Guerini side-plated over-and-under\n\n\nBlaser F3 over-and-under\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPurdey side-by-side self-opening sidelock\n\n\nThe Purdey sidelock is made at the firm''s Hammersmith factory by a combination of craft skills and high technology (both being used wherever an advantage in the quality of the finished product can be achieved). Traditional action decoration includes classic hand-cut Purdey rose-and-scroll engraving, but other options are possible at greater cost. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, the Purdey gun is possibly the greatest side-by-side ever made. It cocks on closing (unlike the Holland & Holland Royal, which became its great rival), so the springs are at rest when the gun is disassembled. Another clever feature of the design, created by Frederick Beesley and sold to Purdey for £55 in the late-Victorian era, is that one limb of the V-type mainspring is used to power the tumbler (hammer) in each lock and the other the self-opening feature. \n\nThe refined ''WEM'' ejector mechanism is a modification of the Southgate over-centre type (long the favourite of the gun trade) but requires finer adjustment than others of similar principle. The Purdey''s work is also singular and rarely copied because of its complexity (it should be noted, however, that the gun was first offered as a non-ejector in the 1880s). Finally, the Purdey is as famous for balance as its impeccable design, fit and build quality. It has always tended to be a little heavier than some of its competitors and many experienced shots would say it shoots the better for it. Prices start at about £57,000 including VAT. \n\nMy choice would be either a 29in barrelled 16- or 20-bore game-gun with standard rose-and-scroll or a similarly decorated heavy, side-clipped action 30in or 31in barrelled pigeon-gun - which might be just as well set up for high birds and sporting clay-pigeons. I am especially fond of the generously proportioned, bowed stock on Purdey pigeon-guns. \n\n\nHolland & Holland Royal side-by-side\n\n\nRenowned for its reliability and more copied than any other sidelock action, the Holland & Holland Royal is the other great sidelock side-by-side design. It is a rebounding lock-bar action sidelock (although some early Royals had non-rebounding locks). As with the Purdey, the Holland incorporates intercepting safety sears, which prevent the tumblers from hitting the striker unless the trigger has been pulled. It also incorporates a Southgate-type ejector system.The Royal has been in constant production since the 1890s in more or less its modern form. I am especially fond of its handling qualities. \n\nThe Holland ''diamond'' straight grip is both elegant and efficient. The aesthetics are generally good and Holland''s distinctive, deep scroll is both beautiful and practical (although, as with most other bespoke makers, other engraving options may be specified). In its latest 12-bore guise the Royal is my favourite shooting side-by-side game-gun. It costs £49,530 excluding VAT in 12-, 16- and 20-bore. The .410 and 28-bore versions start at £52,500 excluding VAT. I would order the standard gun with 28in or 29in barrels with a coin-finished action. It is an outstanding classic gun that will not disappoint ? a very safe bet if you are investing in a new best gun. \n\n\n\nBoss sidelock side-by-side\n\n\nLike the modern Holland, the Boss is a non-rebounding bar-lock gun that is cocked by the fall of its barrels. Like the Purdey and the Holland, it features intercepting safety sears to block the fall of the tumbler if it should fall without the trigger being pulled. Where the Boss differs from both the Purdey and the Holland is in its coil-spring ejector system. These are housed in the fore-end and operate slides, which press on rods acting on the ejector legs on the conventional split extractors. \n\nOne advantage of the coil spring over the more common V-spring is the fact that even when broken the spring will usually activate the ejector until a replacement can be procured. The Boss has a number of other useful features. The extractor legs raise the unfired shells to the same degree as that of an ejected shell, just more slowly and in a smoothly graduated manner rather than with the sharp kick applied to the fired shell. The extractors rise at the speed at which the gun is opened and, because the shells are held well proud of the breech, insertion and extraction of unfired shells is easy with cold or gloved fingers. It costs £55,000 plus VAT for an exhibition-grade 12-, 16- or 20-bore gun (the firm?s only grade). It''s more for 28-bores: £60,000 plus VAT; and .410s cost £65,000. \n\nMy ideal Boss would have a round bar and the firm''s famous single trigger. I would also specify that the wrist be made a little larger than normal to ensure good purchase. As far as bore is concerned, I would opt for a 29in 12-bore or a 30in 16-bore. Weight should be something around 6lb 6oz for the 16-bore and 6lb 8oz or 6lb 10oz (just a little heavier than the old London norm) for the 12-bore. \n\n\nRound action side-by-side as made by David McKay Brown and Dickson & MacNaughton\nAlthough it is understated in external form, this is an especially elegant gun. Dickson & Murray patented the round action in 1882. It is the strongest of all side-by-side designs because less metal is cut out of the action bar. The lock work is mounted on a trigger plate and can be removed in one piece from the underside of the action. The round action side-by-side is cocked by the fall of the barrels and its great merit is that while the action bar is strong it doesn''t weaken the hand of the stock. Consequently, the Dickson-style gun can be very light yet robust, with weight centred in the forward part of the action around the hinge-pin. This creates liveliness and makes it very pleasant to shoot. \n\nThe mechanical efficiency is great in respect of cocking of the locks as well. The round action is, in effect, an easy opener without the need for extra spring assistance. A properly weighted 12-bore (about 6lb 8oz) will, when broken in, usually cock itself with the fall of the barrels. The gun is also easy to close because of its good design. I have found the 12-bore McKay Brown version performs well with excellent practical shooting qualities. Cost is £26,000 excluding VAT and engraving (classic Scottish scroll adding about £2,050 to the price). \n\n\nRemanufactured Stephen Grant side lever 12-bore\n\n\nI have always thought the Grant side lever one of the most beautiful guns ever made. My uncle had a pair in his gunroom and they left an impression on me at an early age. Now, thanks to the new remanufacturing service offered by Atkin, Grant & Lang, one may acquire what is effectively a new Grant. \n\nAtkin, Grant & Lang, under the direction of Ken Duglan, has developed a service where it takes a vintage gun in suitable condition (with a structurally sound, crisply engraved action), and uses it as the base for the creation of a new gun. This is not a restoration service as such, although the action will be vacuum annealed by a hi-tech process and re-hardened. New barrels and woodwork will be made to customers'' requirements. All springs and swivels will be replaced (and disc set strikers if fitted). The gun will be presented in a new, fitted case with accessories. The cost is £15,000, which is excellent value considering that one ends up with what is in effect a new London gun. \n\nI have not shot a remanufactured Grant yet but I have shot a remanufactured Lang extensively and it was first class in all departments - not only as good as new with regard to looks but especially good to shoot, with new barrels by Bill Blacker, a beautifully shaped and finished stock by Stephane Dupille and action work by Gary Hibbert - all modern masters. \n\n\nBoss over-and-under (patented 1909)\n\n\nWith the low-profile bifurcated lump, Boss established the over-and-under configuration in England (though the stack-barrelled concept is very old and predates the side-by-side). In-stead of the barrels turning on a hinge-pin, they locate into tapering slots in bushes near the knuckle of the action. These turn in the action body as the gun is opened or closed (a feature not much copied because of its complexity though Bertuzzi, the Italian best gunmaker, has made Boss-style guns and Beretta made one in the early Thirties). \n\nThe Boss dispenses with the traditional side-by-side arrangement of placing lumps on the underside of the barrels. On an over-and-under such protrusions, still seen in some designs, necessitate a deeper action. Robertson, the design genius of Boss, took the lumps and placed one on either side of the lower barrel, solving the problem of action height. Under-barrel bolting/locking was replaced by small, square section pegs coming out of the breech face, which engaged with bites on each side of the bottom chamber mouth. \n\nThe action of the Boss also has draws and wedges, whereby a concave face on the rear bifurcated lump engages a corresponding convex face on the inner-action walls. The ejectors on the Boss over-and-under are of the coil-spring type used on Boss side-by-side guns. The success of the gun lies with its combination of ease of use and light weight (until recently, about 6½lb in 12-bore was the norm). It was also one of the first English guns avail-able with a truly reliable single trigger. The 12- 16- and 20-bore cost £75,000 plus VAT while 28-bore and .410 cost £85,000 plus VAT. I''d be tempted by a 12-bore, but I would not have it made too light - no less than 6lb 12oz. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurdey Woodward over-and-under\n\n\nIn 1913, Woodward patented a similar low-profile over-and-under action to Boss. However, it incorporated a tongue-and-groove system, which locked the barrels to the side of the action walls and used a different hinging arrangement whereby the full-width hinge of the traditional side-by-side and earlier over-and-unders was replaced with stud-pins at the knuckle instead of rotating bushes, as in the Boss. The Woodward arrangement has since been adopted by Beretta, Perazzi and others. \n\nPurdey acquired Woodward and its famous over-and-under design in 1948 when Charles Woodward retired. Woodward?s take on the over-and-under mirrored the Boss one in the utilisation of bifurcated lumps on either side of the under barrel rather than the traditional Purdey under-bolts employed on side-by-sides. This strategy enables the gun to be made with a reduced depth of action and gives it a more streamlined appearance. \n\nThe ejectors adopted by Woodward are of the over-centre type, but they are of a complex design. To be successful, the many interlocking faces require the best workmanship. The Woodward is also notable for its good gape, which makes loading easier than in some over-and-under designs. Prices start at £67,500 including VAT. My recommendation would be a double-trigger 20-bore with 30in barrels, colour case-hardened action and house scroll. \n\n\nBrowning Superposed over-and-under\n\n\nThe Browning Superposed, also known as the B25, was invented by John Moses Browning in around 1920 and was first marketed in 1930. Unlike the more complex Boss and Woodward over-and-under designs, the Browning - conceived with mass production in mind - reverts to the conventional side-by-side system of lumps positioned beneath the barrel and hence makes use of a full-width hinge-pin (necessitating a deeper-action profile but offering good bearing surfaces). \n\nWith regard to locking, the Superposed has a wide, flat bolt which engages slot bites beneath the bottom chamber mouth (copied in the Winchester 101 and other simplified versions). The ejector system involves spring-powered hammers in the knuckle end of the fore-end iron. This is a simple and most efficient system. The butt and grip shape on the B25 are typically good too, provided that the flutes at the nose of the comb are not too exaggerated. The Browning stock has served as a pattern for other manufacturers. \n\nThe Superposed is a design icon and has proved itself for more than 75 years in the field. It is still made by traditional methods in Belgium with prices starting at about £8,500 depending on embellishment. Cheaper but no less rugged models are also being produced in Japan by Miroku with prices from around £1,200. The Japanese-made gun is slightly simplified and involves less handwork but offers excellent value (and the similar Miroku model 60s and 70s are some of the best buys on the market). I would go for a non-side plated Belgium-made gun with simple scroll and 30in barrels. \n\n\n\n\n\nBeretta 68 series over-and-under\n\n\nBeretta makes some of the most popular game- and competition guns in the world (with its production of over-and-unders exceeding 50,000 per annum). The 68 series guns are famously reliable and made, even in cheaper grades, from first-class materials; Beretta is one of the few manufacturers to maintain a sophisticated metallurgical laboratory on site and pays a great deal of attention to production consistency. \n\nAll 68 series guns have bifurcated lumps, stud-pins at the knuckle and are locked by conical bolts that emerge from the breech face as the gun is closed and set in small round sockets either side of the top chamber mouth. This system is an especially clever feature of the design and, like the hinge-pins, may be replaced by over-size parts to allow for wear. The guns also have shoulder pieces on the barrels (replaceable in some competition models) which set in corresponding recesses in the top rear of the action wall. \n\nBeretta 68 series guns in 12- and 20-bore are among the most popular game-guns in Britain, with good reason. Recent models are available with improved stock shapes and a chemically achieved decorative effect mimicking traditional colour case-hardening. My favourite game model, however, is the side-plated EELL in 20- or 28-bore. It''s a gun that will not disgrace itself in any company and costs under £4,115, a great deal of gun for the money. However, the plainer Silver Pigeons in 12- or 20-bore at around £1,500 are probably the best buys of all. \n\n\nPerazzi over-and-under\n\n\nThe Boss and Woodward influenced low-profile action, seen in both drop- and fixed lock form, is admired within the gun trade and has been much copied by Kemen and Perugini & Visini among many others. The generic style also forms the basis of the new Purdey Sporter. The Perazzi action, like the Woodward and Beretta, dispenses with a full-width hinge-pin and replaces it with stud-pins at the knuckle. The action and barrel monobloc incorporate Boss-style draws and wedges and the bolting system is Boss-inspired as well. \n\nPerazzis are renowned for their excellent trigger pulls and their barrel quality, and the company for its innovative approach to manufacturing. I have always found Perazzi barrels to be well regulated with regard to choke and point of impact. Indeed, I find them to be more consistent in this respect than those of any other firm (with the possible exception of Fabbri). \n\nPerazzis appear to be especially good value at the moment, with prices beginning at about £4,500 regardless of bore. The price is the same for 12- or 20-bore models with fixed or detachable triggers and there is no extra charge for bespoke gunmaking. For game-shooting, my choice would be a longer barrelled 20-bore, though a 29½in 12-bore fixed lock MX12 would also tempt for field use. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKemen\n\n\nThe Kemen is very similar to the Perazzi droplock gun. The action is of low profile like the Perazzi, with similar hinging and bolting, and also shares an ancestral debt to Boss and Woodward, who developed the bifurcated-lump system at the beginning of the last century. Kemens achieved great success when they were first launched not so much because of their build quality (the Perazzi was in some ways a better-engineered gun), but because of their outstanding handling relating to barrel weight and good stock shapes. They are light-for-length and most popular in 32in form. \n\nRecently, the guns have not only improved with regard to manufacturing consistency but have been redesigned to reduce the width of the action at rear and thus allow for a stronger stock. This is a very significant development and makes the Kemen not only one of the world''s best-handling long guns but also more reliable with less risk of stocks cracking. \n\nBriley chokes are an option on Kemens, but most UK buyers opt for a muzzle-light, quick-reacting, fixed-choke gun (although a significant number approach Nigel Teague for retro-fitting of his thin wall precision chokes that allow choke constriction choice without any weight penalty). A 32in Kemen with barrels weighing around 1,550g is one of the finest high-bird guns in existence and also an awesome tool for sporting clays. I use one myself much of the time (as well as several other Continental guns). \n\n\n\n\nDavid McKay Brown round action over-and-under\n\n\nThis is an over-and-under gun of imaginative and patented design similar to the classic Scottish round action side-by-side mechanism but applied to a stack-barrelled configuration. It incorporates a bow-springed trigger-plate lock, as proven in the round action side-by-side. It has bifurcated barrel lumps and Boss-style draws and wedges within the barrel seat. Ejectors are not unlike those on a Perazzi, although David has made significant modifications. I have shot several 20-bore and 12-bore versions of this gun and they all performed well. \n\nThe basic gun costs £34,000 plus VAT and engraving (a cut-away floral scroll with a game scene costs £2,850). David''s latest projects include dedicated high-bird guns with long barrels and choke borings regulated for extreme range. He is also working on a 16-bore version. My choice, however, would be a 29in 12-bore with Celtic engraving and a coin-finished action. \n\n\n\n\n\nFabbri over-and-under\n\n\nThe firm of Fabbri, developed by design ge-nius Ivo Fabbri (who also had a hand in the development of the Perazzi gun), and now run by his son Tulio, has the distinction of producing one of the world?s most expensive and admired guns (prices begin at around £80,000 without engraving). Fabbri is a great innovator when it comes to hi-tech manufacture and makes no secret of the fact that its very pricey wares are predominantly machine-made. But it has turned the use of machinery into an art in itself (as Purdey is now doing). Fabbri is especially popular in the US, where the firm has become famous not only for game- but for its pigeon-shooting guns as well. \n\nFabbri produces some shotguns entirely fabricated of stainless steel; titanium also features in a few of its fabulous creations. The firm has made a few side-by-sides but it is best known for exquisitely machined over-and-unders. These incorporate many innovations, such as diamond-coated sears in the locks and barrels that are superbly true and brought together with minimum stress by non-traditional methods. In mechanical function principle, though, they resemble London over-and-under guns (as do those of most other premier league Italian makers such as Piotti, Desenzani, Bosis and Bertuzzi). The second-hand value of Fabbris remains high and the firm''s order books are full. Unlike some very expensive guns, Fabbris have a reputation for reliability, with many guns made 30 or more years ago still in regular hard use. \n\nI have no great experience of these guns so I will not suggest a potential specification, but many of the people whose opinion I value tell me that Fabbris are truly extraordinary, a gunmaking triumph. My decorative preference, I suspect, would probably be for the very tightest scroll that is on offer at the Creative Arts studio, the engraving firm in Gardone that most top Italian makers use (under the direction of Cesare Giovannelli, it has also been responsible for developing the machine- and laser-engraving processes adopted by middle-market manufacturers). \n\n\nHolland & Holland Royal over-and-under\nThe first Royal model over-and-unders were seen before the Second World War but were of a very different design to modern guns and somewhat clumsy by comparison. In the early Nineties Holland completely redesigned the Royal over-and-under. The modern gun has bifurcated lumps and back-action locks. The ejectors are powered by leaf springs in the fore-end and the gun is available with either a traditional double trigger or an inertia-operated single trigger. \n\nThe Royal over-and-under is available in just about any conceivable specification: 12, 16- and 20-bore with barrels, rib and stock dimensions and configuration to customer requirements. Prices begin at £60,375 plus VAT; 28-bore and .410 guns cost £63,525. My favourite over-and-under game-gun bar none (and the one I would buy with the Royal side-by-side and a Purdey pigeon-gun if my Lottery numbers came up) is the 29in 20-bore weighing in at around 6lb 4oz. It is a superb tool, not flashy, with the traditional Holland & Holland scroll, but beautiful and a wonderful gun to use. One can find more obsessively finished guns but none that shoot better. \n\n\nBosis side-by-side\n\nBosis side-by-side guns are imported into the UK by both Paul Roberts (020 7622 1131) and Victor Chapman (01206 213068). The guns offer excellent design, flexibility of specification and good value. The side-by-side is currently known as the Queen model (and there is a Woodward-style over-and-under called the Michael Angelo). The side-by-sides are of a non self-opening Holland & Holland Royal pattern like so many others, with intercepting safety sears in conventional bar-action locks. \n\nBosis guns exhibit excellent design and good workmanship in all departments. The lock work, in particular, impresses when disassembled. Pricing, typically, is about half of a best London gun at about £23,000 including VAT. It is also interesting to note that recently Bosis has been undertaking action and lock work for the English trade. If I ordered one, it would be a 29in barrelled side-by-side with a flat, pigeon-style rib weighing about 6lb 10oz - a gun that I would use with 1oz payload cartridges as an all-round game-gun. The Bosis side-by-side offers especially good value at the moment. \n\n\nAyA No 1 Deluxe - English finish\n\nFor the first half of the 20th century, Spain''s reputation as a gunmaking country was somewhat sullied by the production of thousands of cheap guns. In the Sixties, though, enterprising firms such as ASI (the importers of AyA) discovered that Spanish craftsmen were still making better quality sporting guns by traditional methods for home consumption. These were often modelled (sometimes with peculiarities) on those of the famous British makers such as Holland & Holland and Purdey. \n\nASI guided AyA into making both sidelocks and boxlocks to precisely British specifications and achieved great success. The recent AyA No 2 Model round bodied gun is attractive, but hardly bears comparison to the superb No 1 Deluxe, now available with English engraving and finish. The Holland & Holland-style engraving is usually executed by Geoff Moore and prices begin at £13,750 including VAT (with reasonable supplements applying to extras such as single triggers, self-opening and unusual stock specifications). \n\nI have shot the gun in both 12- and 20-bore versions. Both look very good but the latter is especially sweet to shoot and represents excellent value by modern standards. Only an expert eye would distinguish it from a best English gun on cursory inspection. The AyA No 2 sidelock, though it may not bear aesthetic comparison to the extra finish gun, might be noted as an extraordinarily reliable shooting tool (like most AyA guns). \n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam & Son side-by-side sidelock\n\nWilliam & Son makes a variety of side-by-side and over-and-under sporting guns (about 12 annually). My favourite is the 12-bore Holland & Holland-style self-opening double-trigger sidelock ejector gun. This, like the Holland & Holland Royal that was the inspiration for it, is not especially innovative but is beautifully made and finished, maintaining the highest standards of the London gun trade. \n\nThe gun, which is usually built a little narrower than the Holland Royal and has similar Southgate ejectors, is entirely bespoke and would be presented with exhibition-grade walnut and deep-scroll engraving (or anything else at the client''s request). A typical 28in 20-bore would weigh in at 6lb 4oz and cost from £36,500 plus VAT; 28-bore and .410 models are available at the same price. For the quality offered, the guns represent good value. \n\n\nCaesar Guerini side-plated over-and-under\n\nCaesar Guerini guns are made with advanced technology in Italy. They offer sound design, style and great value. The side-plated models, which typically cost between £1,595 and £4,250 are, in my opinion, one of the best over-and-under buys on the market. Guerinis are available in various models with and without side-plates, but the latter are especially attractive and have proved a great hit with both gun dealers and buyers. \n\nThe guns, produced in a recently purpose-built factory, are innovative with regard to their method of manufacture but not especially radical in their design. The specification includes bifurcated lumps, a Browning-style bolting system and monobloc barrels. The hammers are powered by coil springs. With regard to shooting qualities, the 20-bore with 30in barrels and semi-pistol grip would be my recommendation. If you cannot quite afford a Beretta EELL this excellent modern gun is a good second choice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlaser F3 over-and-under\nThe Blaser is a radical new design with an exceptionally low-profile, fast-lock time and back bored barrels equipped with first-class Briley extended chokes (cylinder, skeet, modified, improved modified and full). The inline hammers and firing pins make the most efficient use of kinetic energy and offer some theoretical advantages. The twin safety mechanisms include the usual trigger block and clever intercepting safety sears. \n\nThe Blaser F3 shotgun combines computer controlled manufacturing techniques with traditional handfitting where required. In its plainer grades, the F3 is also surprisingly inexpensive for a quality German product. Prices start at around £2,700, inclusive of VAT, for the basic game-gun and can rise to somewhere over £10,000 for the side-plated Royal model. \n\nThe external form of the new F3 gun is incredibly elegant. The action has clean lines and, in its basic form, an attractive and practical stone-grey finish. My favourite model is the 30in, narrow-ribbed game-gun. This specification is, in my opinion, the best handling in the range. It has proved to be effective in the field and also ideal for the occasional foray on to the clay-pigeon layout. \n\nThe Cynergy is a radical new design made in Japan for Browning by Miroku. The gun is built around a new low-profile ''Monolock'' over-and-under action. Instead of having barrels that pivot on a full-width hinge-pin like most Brownings or stud-pins like a Beretta or Perazzi, the Cynergy has massive bearing surfaces machined into its monobloc. These engage matching surfaces inside the walls of the action body. The Monolock is clever and innovative and results in a very low action profile - one of the lowest I''ve seen in a 12-bore. \n\nIt has several other interesting features included in its basic specification: back-bored barrels, interchangeable chokes, chrome-lined chambers for better rust resistance and a mechanical single trigger (preferable in a game-gun where a variety of cartridge payloads may be employed). \n\nThe butt is a modern, ergonomically efficient hog''s back design and the fore-end is angular but efficient. The Cynergy came out initially with an effective but sticky ''Inflex'' recoil pad. Now it is available in more conventional form. In 20-bore with 28in or 30in barrels it handles especially well - light and lively but with great pointability and low perceived recoil. This is a gun for the modernist and costs around £2,000 in 12- or 20-bore. My favourite in the field is the 30in 20-bore. \n\nThe list above is not perfect, nor could it be. I suspect that the top Italian guns might have had more mention although, frankly, my experience of some of them is that they look great and are impeccably engineered but that they do not always shoot quite as well as their thoroughbred looks might suggest. The stock shapes and configuration sometimes let the beautifully finished metalwork down. \n\nMy observations are made through British eyes, of course. They are the eyes of a gunfitter, game- and pigeon-shooter and competitive clay-shot. To me, function always comes first. \n\n\n\n\nLet me dare to ask one final question.\nWhat is the best gun in the world?\n\nI shall fudge the answer by putting it in the context of price. If I had up to £1,500 to spend my choice would be a plain grade Beretta Silver Pigeon 12- or 20-bore. If I had between £3,000 and £4,000 to spend, I''d buy a Beretta EELL or side-plated Caesar Guerini. With £5,000 or so in the bank, I would opt for a Perazzi or Kemen (the latter being an exceptional high-bird gun as noted). Remanufactured vintage guns from Atkin, Grant & Lang represent excellent value and allow for the confident everyday use of a hundred-year-old gun built to your exact requirements. Bosis side-by-sides also represent excellent value when one begins to consider capital expenditure. \n\nWith unlimited funds, I would go for a new Holland Royal side-by-side or over-and-under in 12- and 20-bore respectively, or a Purdey pigeon-gun. If I were Italian, though, it might well have been a Fabbri. One gun on a desert island for the next 20 years? To use the vernacular, that''s a no-brainer: the plain Jane \nBeretta Silver Pigeon\nsimply could not be bettered. It offers the most reliable bang for the least buck. I would have a 28in-barrelled 20-bore if cartridges were available (because the handling qualities mimic those of a much more expensive gun), or a 12-bore if they were not.', ''),

(146746, ' Guys a very interesting thread, but I believe this topic was covered in two different threads already, one was about CQB and the other one was about lights. Basically I agree and disagree with most of the comments given ;) . The thing is that this is a long discussion, but some very good points were given in the posts above. In short, my two cents are, I rather have a light and a laser in any situation, be it hd sd le or whatever. But basically as AK bro said that the original concept was offensive like room clearing etc, rather than defensive, and as for the IR devices, they are useless unless you are wearing a night vision device. So, better to have a light and a laser than not to. :) \n\nAK86 bro, tracers are meant for completely different reason, than the one you stated  :) \n\nAk47 bro another thing, Laser pointers are to be set precisely for various distances, so keep in mind when adjusting your laser, if you set your pointer at 25m, lets say, and fire the gun at 10m, the result will be quite different, so keep this point in mind while using lasers.\n\nAnd to add something more, both visible and IR laser also have other uses which primarily fall into Military category.\n\nSo as AK47 and Steve bro have suggested they are quite a bit of help in various situations.', ''),

If they are given a little back support and fund raising from the Govt, i bet they are gonna make the whole world watch in amazement to there talent[/quote]\n\nThey need education, machinery and raw materials to make their own. Right now the better weapons are made by scavenging , a barrel from here an action from there and the finest walnut is our own and with pains taking effort they have been taught the finer aspects of shot gun stocks, and rifle stocks.\nthe TT pistols they used to make; the barrels  came from the machine guns which were exactly .310 the same dia as a 7.63/7.62 x25 bullet. These were chrome lined and last better and more accurate than the chinese run of the mill TT. The frames sometimes cracked.\nFund raising by government will never lead any one any any where. Immediately corruption and bad politics will come in.\nThey should be given machinery , new lathes and taught what is required. A rifle barrel is  a complete technology. The head space, the angle of the forcing cone, the length of free bore, the rifling twist , depth of grooves and lands width etc are to be known as well as when the barrels are first bored these are annealed and then after the grooves are hook cut, button rifled or cold hammer forged the barrels are relieved of stress once again. The top makers even give them a cryogenic treatment  and final polishing or even fire lapping and then a super accurate barrel is made.\nIn Pakistan only second hand lathes are imported by these mechanics being cheap, but these have already developed run out and play and sold as scrap. We buy expansive imported rifles but when it come to paying even a small amount for local weapons we sneer and bargain; we have to encourage them. I have done my little in sharing my little knowledge with them and always tipping heavily for work done by the mistris for my self and friends. Some people hold it against me for spoiling them. I think those people are spoilt. More power to the mistries ( Armourers of Darra Adam Khel)', ''),

Later they started cutting the barrels to make barrels for TT 7.62 pistols so the barrels shot up to 2100/ and later 6500/-\nThe rifles turned out to be very accurate with the Chinese and the Russian military ammo grouping between 1.5 to 2 inches at 100m which is real good with so cheap military ammo.\nBig bore rifles are fired every day of the week on ranges in Baluchistan and Quetta and they all converted to this round and rifle and used to call it by my name for years.\nSardar Naseer, Baboo Mushtaque, Adnan and Asad Sherani have been winning in the 200 and 300 yard competitions with these rifles since 1987 in the Sibi Mela every year and regular matches they shoot at Quetta. \nBrother Gilani being there can testify to this[/quote]                                                                                                                                         Dear Skeeter60 Sahib you mentioned about a person by the name of Babu Mushtaque,there are 2 Babu Mushtaque''s both are very famous hunters one is I think the father of Haji Bilal and the other one was a Gunsmith which one of them were you referring to?', ''),

And there are confusions all over the internet. \n\nHere at PakGuns I read that all cal semi-auto handguns and revolvers, plus bolt action rifles are allowed in Pakistan. It doesn''t talk about them in detail. You might say that it is pretty self explanatory... But I am still stuck about that clause about CANNONS in Firearms Ordnance, it implies that all guns above .44 cal are banned. And it seems kinda true, because I haven''t seen a Deagle or a .40+ revolver in Pakistan... It isn''t even available in the price-list on PakGuns forum.

Right now the better weapons are made by scavenging , a barrel from here an action from there and the finest walnut is our own and with pains taking effort they have been taught the finer aspects of shot gun stocks, and rifle stocks.\nthe TT pistols they used to make; the barrels  came from the machine guns which were exactly .310 the same dia as a 7.63/7.62 x25 bullet. These were chrome lined and last better and more accurate than the chinese run of the mill TT. The frames sometimes cracked.\nFund raising by government will never lead any one any any where. Immediately corruption and bad politics will come in.\nThey should be given machinery , new lathes and taught what is required. A rifle barrel is  a complete technology. The head space, the angle of the forcing cone, the length of free bore, the rifling twist , depth of grooves and lands width etc are to be known as well as when the barrels are first bored these are annealed and then after the grooves are hook cut, button rifled or cold hammer forged the barrels are relieved of stress once again. The top makers even give them a cryogenic treatment  and final polishing or even fire lapping and then a super accurate barrel is made.\nIn Pakistan only second hand lathes are imported by these mechanics being cheap, but these have already developed run out and play and sold as scrap. We buy expansive imported rifles but when it come to paying even a small amount for local weapons we sneer and bargain; we have to encourage them.

(630660, ' *takes on an air of self-important scholarly attitude*\n\nKid, whenever two land masses get connected, animals of both areas migrate massively to the other side. So when I say that the north american mammalian predators migrated into south america, it is also implied that the little pesky mammals of south america also migrated into north america. This migration is usually overlooked because those little pooh-pooh fools couldnt bring any change to the ecology of north america where giant, horrible mammals were present. It might of interest to you guys *sweeps gaze through the whole classroom* that when Asia and north america got connected through bering-strait land strip (joining Russia to Canada through a very narrow land strip) there were major migration events on both sides. We (Asia) gave them advanced type of bears, goats, sheep and bison, while receiving wolves, wild dogs, deer, camels, horses and rhinos.\n\nAbout the size and predatory competition. Kid, adult ostriches have very few predators. Plus, with the presence of a predator, other predators which target the same prey, have to survive through sheer competition. Take the example of Africa. Lions are the dominant predators there, hunting buffaloes, zebras and some other large game. Due to their presence, there is no other predatory animal in Africa which targets the same prey. Hyenas do eat zebras and buffaloes too, but hyenas are mostly kleptoparasites (bullies, trying and robbing a kill off other predators) instead of active hunters. So now if an animal decides to take on the same ecological role as lions, they will have to face a very long, cold battle with lions for the same prey. It might be interesting for you to know that lions periodically go on rampages against hyenas.\n\nAdd to all this, the fact that phorusrhacids did not have just one, but several types of birds of several sizes. The smallest one was the size of a large dog, I think but I''m not sure. Now we have many of these dreadful birds in the continent which contains only small mammals (all of the mammals in south america were small during this reign of terror). Combine this with another fact that all wild dogs, wolves, tigers, bears, hyenas, coyotes and all other predatory mammals ... none of them originated in south america. There might have been many potential lineages which [B][I]could [/I][/B]have turned into successful predators, but these little pests were quickly disposed off by the ferocious birds of terrors before they could pose any competition.', ''),

Even the gun blogs in USA discuss this subject and there are difference of opinons. \n\nMy logical (if any) point is that motor oil, machine oil, gun oil, silicon oil etc are formulated for specific purposes. Lubricating property is common among them. I agree that Motor oil will work to lubricate the parts however the residue oil accumuates more dirt and in the long run one needs to use WD- 40 or other cleaning agents. And apart from lubrication, cleaning and anti corrosion properties need to be seen. In airguns/rifles the motor oil plays negative. Try using it and the more viscos oil will reduce the efficiency. \n\nMotor oil used in aircraft, if used in motor cycle will not work. Try using JP1, JP4, super, regular or 100 oct fuel alternatively see the difference. All are petrolium products but with different specifications. They work with poor or sometime enhanced efficiency but will damage the machine you are using if not designed for the particular fuel.\n\nYou as an expert disassemble the weapon, clean, relubricate and assemle it again. Most of the people would have to go to gunsmith for the cleaning, misfires and stuck parts.\n\nOff course the gun oil if applied in proper quantity will not spill or overflow.\n\nregards', '');

Even the gun blogs in USA discuss this subject and there are difference of opinons. \n\nMy logical (if any) point is that motor oil, machine oil, gun oil, silicon oil etc are formulated for specific purposes. Lubricating property is common among them. I agree that Motor oil will work to lubricate the parts however the residue oil accumuates more dirt and in the long run one needs to use WD- 40 or other cleaning agents. And apart from lubrication, cleaning and anti corrosion properties need to be seen. In airguns/rifles the motor oil plays negative. Try using it and the more viscos oil will reduce the efficiency. \n\nMotor oil used in aircraft, if used in motor cycle will not work. Try using JP1, JP4, super, regular or 100 oct fuel alternatively see the difference. All are petrolium products but with different specifications. They work with poor or sometime enhanced efficiency but will damage the machine you are using if not designed for the particular fuel.\n\nYou as an expert disassemble the weapon, clean, relubricate and assemle it again. Most of the people would have to go to gunsmith for the cleaning, misfires and stuck parts.\n\nOff course the gun oil if applied in proper quantity will not spill or overflow.\n\nregards[/quote]\n\nOff course a solit logic you put here!!!

Right now the better weapons are made by scavenging , a barrel from here an action from there and the finest walnut is our own and with pains taking effort they have been taught the finer aspects of shot gun stocks, and rifle stocks.\nthe TT pistols they used to make; the barrels  came from the machine guns which were exactly .310 the same dia as a 7.63/7.62 x25 bullet. These were chrome lined and last better and more accurate than the chinese run of the mill TT. The frames sometimes cracked.\nFund raising by government will never lead any one any any where. Immediately corruption and bad politics will come in.\nThey should be given machinery , new lathes and taught what is required. A rifle barrel is  a complete technology. The head space, the angle of the forcing cone, the length of free bore, the rifling twist , depth of grooves and lands width etc are to be known as well as when the barrels are first bored these are annealed and then after the grooves are hook cut, button rifled or cold hammer forged the barrels are relieved of stress once again. The top makers even give them a cryogenic treatment  and final polishing or even fire lapping and then a super accurate barrel is made.\nIn Pakistan only second hand lathes are imported by these mechanics being cheap, but these have already developed run out and play and sold as scrap. We buy expansive imported rifles but when it come to paying even a small amount for local weapons we sneer and bargain; we have to encourage them. I have done my little in sharing my little knowledge with them and always tipping heavily for work done by the mistris for my self and friends. Some people hold it against me for spoiling them.

We have large community who uses this DSA guns and very much fond of your company’s products due to its high quality and repo but one of our very expert member says that the steel used to make the barrels of shooter shotgun is capable of handling the pressures generated but is not designed to fire solid slugs due to the diameter of the barrel. Since he himself visited DSA factory Peshawar couple of times and expert person that is why we have no choice except to believe what he says. \n\nWhat is your expert opinion on this issue? Kindly reply as this is urgently very important to us\n\nThanks & Regards,\n\nAta', ''),

Meanwhile, I negotiated with a production house in the US who''ve agreed to do the editing but will want to have a big chunk of my copyrights for running it on some prominent big game hunting programs in USA, Canada & Western Europe eg: like Bone Collectors, Outdoor Channel, Pursuit TV, Sportsmen on Film, Adventure Films Production, Wild TV, ... etc. These channels charge from US$ 100,000/= to US$ 300,000/= per hour but any film on their channel can easily fetch US$ 2 to 3 millions in a single run .... not to mention its repetition and translated versions on various other channels. So for the time being I''ve left this job pending because it needs full concentration + time + money to accomplish the desired results. And in order to do so, I''ve decided to take my film + script + my story board to the US, sit there, pay the guys, get it done professionally & return to Pakistan only after I''ve shown it on at least one of the above channels. So wish me luck to find a reasonably good sponsor ! Once it''s ready .... you may rest assured it''s DVDS are all yours !', ''),

I have serious dought what you are saying  that Malik Fayyaz did a fraud.\n\nAll weapons and ammo are imported in large quantities by the importer and are distributed to all dealers in Pakistan. Every shop has a price tag. \n\nFor example like S&B ammo imported by a dealer he asked Rs.1200/- each for 173g 7mm Rem. Mag. Bullets. Now the rate has come to 350/ each and available at different shops.  What about few desperate  people who bought same ammo at higher rates from the importer. Now they can say it was a fraud. People say that the S&B ammo box are printed locally, some say handgun ammo is totally local made. So one cannot pass a [i]Verdict[/i].\n\nBy the way due to bullet weight & design it’s disliked among the mag owners, still no one wants to buy @350/-.

The thing is that the 628 as far as I know is meant for the MP5 type weapons, and is a dedicated foreend only for the MP5 type series and is not a universal type of light, and its made up to mil-spec standards. I have never personally used the airsoft ones, but I know for sure that most probably they will not hold up to the rate of fire and the heat the MP5 produces, i.e 900 rounds per minute.

(147182, ' [quote=SPAYPANTHER][quote=hussainmirza44]@spaypanther\n\nWell lets agree to disagree brother. Even the gun blogs in USA discuss this subject and there are difference of opinons. \n\nMy logical (if any) point is that motor oil, machine oil, gun oil, silicon oil etc are formulated for specific purposes. Lubricating property is common among them. I agree that Motor oil will work to lubricate the parts however the residue oil accumuates more dirt and in the long run one needs to use WD- 40 or other cleaning agents. And apart from lubrication, cleaning and anti corrosion properties need to be seen. In airguns/rifles the motor oil plays negative. Try using it and the more viscos oil will reduce the efficiency. \n\nMotor oil used in aircraft, if used in motor cycle will not work. Try using JP1, JP4, super, regular or 100 oct fuel alternatively see the difference. All are petrolium products but with different specifications. They work with poor or sometime enhanced efficiency but will damage the machine you are using if not designed for the particular fuel.\n\nYou as an expert disassemble the weapon, clean, relubricate and assemle it again. Most of the people would have to go to gunsmith for the cleaning, misfires and stuck parts.\n\nOff course the gun oil if applied in proper quantity will not spill or overflow.\n\nregards[/quote]\n\nOff course a solit logic you put here!!!  But thing is that manufecture does’t define that which great oil should use in a particuler gun!!! ( but in case of vhecial it is defined)\n\nPeoples are affraied to use moter oil then what about grease which is much vicous and thick![/quote]\n\n\nto check the quality about define of any motor oil get one drop of oil on your finger tip and rub your finger fast with thumb if your finger feel rubish thats wrong quality & if feel smooth that`s  good quality just for your motor lubrication  otherwise do what you want to do  :lol:   :lol:   :lol:', ''),

(628407, 'The beginning - What it took my to kickoff first duck hunt I had some good experiences of going with friends on their arrangements once in year for duck shoot, always been great. Since I have moved and my company of friends is 12 hours drive from Lahore, after a major break I decided to set my own little shop up and go out duck hunting. \n\nFirst question that I did not know and still do not know the right answer to is : \n1. Everyone has decoy setup, so I built one and keep on building it as I do not think there is any right number, I started with 36. \n2. Rigging them with weights is not straight forward because, thread tangle and cause delay in setting them up. I have decided to use a nylon thread that I got from Corel on Wahdat road. Use them and dispose them. Keep the weights and keep the decoys.\n3. Concealment is the most important things, camouflage--- the more the better \n4. Wader, very handy and useful thing \n5. Call a department I am very weak in, will try to use speakers and recorded sounds\n\nNext question I tried to figure out is, when is the right time. Most of experienced people know but I realized this after comeback without a single duck on the first trip. More wind, less shine, mornings of moon lit nights, colder, low visibility.  \n\nAreas to pick from : \nI figured : Ravi and surrounds  will be good before 15th of November and then in January. \nI yet have to figure out the Chennab area, hopefully we will local support ( a must ) soon \ni will post more details for novices from time to time and may be we can bunch together some time. \n\nSteps I will take to improve is :\nto figure which type moves when... So far I know teal moves first and starts to move in September, Peaks in October. \nto survey local area a day or two before, find someone who has worked with hunters first. \nto know 20 yards from 35 yards :-) I am sure I will get better at this \nto adjust drop of my gun a little -- took time to figure that this is the most important thing to setup for shotguns :-) \nto buy more moving decoys\n\nThe gun I use and I am loving it now is Baikal MP 155, besides all the horror stories of this not reloading, not being able to fire straight, low quality etc. I found this gun to be super fantastic for the cost when next good gas will be plus of 200,000 plus. From first fire to all the others, I heard you have to fire 100 first to kind of break the gun, not a single  time I had an issue of reload. \n\nNow I need to fit adjust the drop using the shims. I suggest all new hunter to study this and your scores will improve by a huge number. Next thing to master is the "swing". \n\n\n\nFew useful links : \n\n[URL]http://www.gma.vic.gov.au/education/shotgunning-education/section-2-understanding-your-tools-and-environment[/URL]\n\n[URL]http://www.gma.vic.gov.au/education/shotgunning-education/section-3-sharpen-your-skills[/URL]\n\n[url]http://www.huntingnet.com/fieldjournal/fieldjournal_detail.aspx?nID=452[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.browning.com/customerservice/qna/detail.asp?id=129[/url]\n\n\n\nI will look forward to talking with other serious beginners to form a strong hunting group around.', ''),

Well you can never be sure about when you will be selling yours, what price will it fetch.\n\nI can say that it is quite rough and tough gun, and very well built as well. It can be your gun as long as you want and it might not get in a bad condition even after prolong use. So, hopefully it will fetch some decent amount. \n\nBut please remember that weapons are normally not a good point of investment, financially speaking. Their prices tend to go down with time, however if you are lucky you can get some better amount. Or shall I say that there is not any weapon I have heard of whose resale value is like some other commodities.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,', ''),

The gas port  was welded closed and was fixed in the US P14 or P17  Enfield rifles  made by Winchester, Remington and Eddystone.\nI made several and presented some to my friends in Quetta.\nThe reason was the ammo was so cheap you could get 3 rounds for one ruppee or 20 bullets to a US dollar, in 1987.\nEven now the ammo is for about Rs 30 a round or a 3 to a US dollar.\nI had the first Rifles made in Zore Qalay, in Darra Adam khel and every one laughed at the idea, these were made by Yaqeen Shah and  when asked by friends if the rifles were custom made and by whom and I would say by ( Yauqin Shaw ) an Austrian gun maker, and  every body would believe me, and appreciate the work of the Austrian gun smith and then I would tell them the finest wood for the stock  can only come from Pakistan and that it was poor old Yaqueen Shah and later Mistri Aseel Khan who made these rifles for a song at that time.\nIt was 1987, the action of the P17 or P14 Enfield cost around 2500/- and the barrel from the Russian Machine gun Rs 900/-. Later they started cutting the barrels to make barrels for TT 7.62 pistols so the barrels shot up to 2100/ and later 6500/-\nThe rifles turned out to be very accurate with the Chinese and the Russian military ammo grouping between 1.5 to 2 inches at 100m which is real good with so cheap military ammo.\nBig bore rifles are fired every day of the week on ranges in Baluchistan and Quetta and they all converted to this round and rifle and used to call it by my name for years.\n[b]Sardar Naseer, Baboo Mushtaque, Adnan and Asad Sherani have been winning in the 200 and 300 yard competitions with these rifles since 1987 in the Sibi Mela every year and regular matches they shoot at Quetta.[/b] \nBrother Gilani being there can testify to this[/quote]\n+1 Skeeter sahib.

(147444, ' Since i bought my hand gun PT-809E couple of months ago, i did not have a chance to test it on the range till today.\nFirst of all let me tell you that i am an amateur in this field and it was my first ever range session but more range sessions will follow INSHALLAH as i have got the membership of Lahore Rifle Club.\nMy prime focus in today''s session was to check the reliability & durability of my hand gun, though i believe one range session is not sufficient to test the reliability & durability of a hand gun but atleast it can provide you with a fair bit of idea.\n\nFour different types of ammos were tested today.\n\n1. Chinese Red Box 115 grains FMJ                     Shots Fired = 46\n2. POF 2z 124 grains FMJ (LOT 2004)                  Shots Fired = 8\n3. Armscor 124 grains JHP                                   Shots Fired = 1\n4. Prvi Partizan 115 grains JHP                            Shots Fired = 1\n\n                                                                            Total Shots Fired = 56\n\nThere was not a single issue of FTF/FTE with any ammo. I also loaded the magazine to its limit i.e. with 17 bullets and it fired all the bullets flawlessly. I even tried different combination of ammos in the magazine and again to my delight the gun fired without any problem what so ever.\nNow let us talk about the accuracy of PT-809E, as i mentioned earlier that my shooting skills are below average so i believe to be fair; the gun''s accuracy cannot be judged on my skills as of now, therefore 3 shots were fired by an experienced shooter and he hit two 9s and one 8 (Just to mention that it was shooter''s first experience with PT-809E and he liked the gun''s accuracy quite a bit).\nThe shots around 2 and 1 area of the below chart were fired by me.\n\n[img]http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/9724/pic1xm.jpg[/img]', ''),

Or did he???\n\nGilani Sb had already stated prior to that, that we would not be able to get the genuine ones, since P.O.F according to him has not distributed it''s 2z rounds to the civilian market since long, perhaps more than a year, if not more!!!\n\nWell, then what is this thing that''s landing in the market then, everywhere around the country, Lhr, Peshawar, haripur, etc???\n\nWell, we took a package of 50 of these so called "genuine 2z''s" and compared them to the REAL ones brought over by Gilani Sb, though he only had some 30 of these along with him. I feel these are the same rounds that A. Abbas bro purchased from Lhr, and also went to other respectable senior members.\n\nLet me post a few pics for comparison, and a few words later of the screwed up results in using it.  :mad: \n\nThe full shiny ones and [b]full copper colored tips[/b] were the rounds from the market, whereas the [b]darker nuance[/b] and "[b]greenish gold[/b]" colored tips were Gilani Sb'' s genuine ones, from a box opened some 15 days back. judge for yourself:\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/ig2jl37o/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/95ku9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/ig474fpg/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/95mZi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://postimage.org/image/ig95qh6s/][img]http://s3.postimage.org/95usJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nKindly note the slight [b]line imprint[/b] by the neck of the shell in the [b]genuine[/b] ones by Gilani Sb. The fake ones are simple, plain, also more "beautiful" and attractive, yet let Gilani Sb himself speak on how it sucked at the session!\n\nProjectile tips of the fakes are also [i]slightly[/i] more pointed than the originals.\n\nI never knew there would be this much of difference in accuracy, from ammo to ammo!  :o \n\nI''ve the feeling that there''s a big market bluff going on, P.O.F 2Z cannot be this common in the market, that too @ 35!  :)', ''),

Thanks a lot Sir :) \n\nThe highlights of our short range session were; I was quite tired after travelling all day, time was around maghrib and light was fast fading out, we only had one target sheet and on top of all, local kids were desperately trying to reach as close to us as possible and we were continuously busy at keeping them away.  :(  :/ \n\nYou must have made out that above were not the ideal conditions to range test a gun. But we still did it, thanks to quick arrangements by Syed Adeel sahib. Buy obviously, these results by no means indicate the actual worth of a weapon. However, you would notice that even during these un-congenial circumstances, Klinc 2000 still performed better than many handguns that I have fired so far. In better conditions, I have no doubts in saying that I will shoot far better with this gun. \n\n\n\nTo start with, I think this is the closest copy of CZ75 that I have seen. Same wonderful grip and sleek profile that has always been the hallmark of CZ75. A very well made gun with nice finish. Has a steel frame which goes the best with the internal slide mechanism of CZ handguns. The gun has a natural pointability, which again has been a characteristic of CZ75. Has hardly any recoil and second shot placement is very quick. Sights are reasonably good, could have been better.  \n\n\n[img]http://i938.photobucket.com/albums/ad221/Gilani_pics/Competative%20Shooting/DSCN7171.jpg[/img]\nHere is the result.

This performance is still better than the chinese or Armscor ammo. Therefore, my major observation is not on accuracy. Accuracy is reasonable, though not as good as the original ones. However, higher recoil, bad smell and more smoke indicates difference in the propellant filling. The feeling was like firing a real +P ammo and my hand was getting a strong jolt, specially when I fired this ammo with CZ999 and Stoeger.

With HPs which have a different bullet shape, this problem would increase. You would have to try different JHPs with your CF98 and see which one fires better. If you find one giving no feeding problems, its good. If you don''t, stick to FMJs and avoid JHPs in a CF98.  :) \n\nA standard reply can not be given because the performance would differ from handgun to handgun.

(147547, ' [quote=Tomahawk]Since i bought my hand gun PT-809E couple of months ago, i did not have a chance to test it on the range till today.\nFirst of all let me tell you that i am an amateur in this field and it was my first ever range session but more range sessions will follow INSHALLAH as i have got the membership of Lahore Rifle Club.\nMy prime focus in today''s session was to check the reliability & durability of my hand gun, though i believe one range session is not sufficient to test the reliability & durability of a hand gun but atleast it can provide you with a fair bit of idea.\n\nFour different types of ammos were tested today.\n\n1. Chinese Red Box 115 grains FMJ                     Shots Fired = 46\n2. POF 2z 124 grains FMJ (LOT 2004)                  Shots Fired = 8\n3. Armscor 124 grains JHP                                   Shots Fired = 1\n4. Prvi Partizan 115 grains JHP                            Shots Fired = 1\n\n                                                                            Total Shots Fired = 56\n\nThere was not a single issue of FTF/FTE with any ammo. I also loaded the magazine to its limit i.e. with 17 bullets and it fired all the bullets flawlessly. I even tried different combination of ammos in the magazine and again to my delight the gun fired without any problem what so ever.\nNow let us talk about the accuracy of PT-809E, as i mentioned earlier that my shooting skills are below average so i believe to be fair; the gun''s accuracy cannot be judged on my skills as of now, therefore 3 shots were fired by an experienced shooter and he hit two 9s and one 8 (Just to mention that it was shooter''s first experience with PT-809E and he liked the gun''s accuracy quite a bit).\nThe shots around 2 and 1 area of the below chart were fired by me.\n\n[img]http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/9724/pic1xm.jpg[/img][/quote]\n\n\nnice first report is this good for cc', ''),

Market is flooded these days with different types of 9mm ammo and one easily can buy authentic load buy just paying 20-25% more than so called POF ammo available these days. More importantly after recent POF ammo experiences by PG members we concluded that there must be a manufacturer who got all the dies n setup for making 9x19 brass that he is using for POF knock-off''s instead of making his own brand which involves a lengthy legal formalities & costs a fortune to introduce n sell a new brand, [b]faking[/b] instead of [b]making[/b] most of the times is more beneficial & fast  ;)', ''),

(628397, ' Thanks. If I just wanted a good gun to shoot I probably would have made more effort to track down an 87. But this is something I would probably like to customize in the future, so the availability and variety of parts also affected my decision. \n\nAnyways, with over a dozen different Buckmark models to choose from, the Plus UDX has everything I want... blued finish, Walnut grips, contoured finger grooves, 5 1/2" slab sided barrel, adjustable target sight in the rear, and Truglow fiber optic in the front. Only problem being... it''s not in stock. So, now comes the long wait for Browning to build the gun :D', ''),
