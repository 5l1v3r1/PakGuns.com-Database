I guess people don''t look at the pro points of investing in an air rifle, with a powerful springer you can compare some of those magnum springer to a bolt action .22Lr the only difference is ammo is cheaper and you don''t need a license.

In those Dhans Snakeheads (SOL) are abundant. But the size of the Snakehead which probably you have caught on a spoon is very good and this size is not very common in those Dhans.\r\n\r\nI hunt and fish as well and I am also a member of PGFA where you have also reported this catch of yours. Its surely an outstanding catch in reference to Ravi and its Dhans.\r\n\r\nComing from Lahore after crossing Head Balloki turn immediately right and go on the Bund track till you cross spur No. 6 on your right, go straight on the same track and you will see a small lake on your right, its a good spot for fishing and someone was telling me that Fisheries Dept. has reserved this lake for angling only. May be you have already caught this Sol from the same lake, because your description of the spot mathches this lake. At this time of the year River Ravi is connected to this lake.\r\n\r\nLater at the end of Monsoon season, try your luck downstream at Head Balloki upto late September or early October. \r\n\r\nBut I would advise you to explore other spots like Ganda Singh Wala at River Sutlaj, but it requires contacts to reach there since its located on the Indo-Pak border or try to reach Mangla Dam, a beautiful lake with clean pollution free water, which is currently my destination for fishing as well.\r\n\r\nWish you good luck.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(355583, ' [QUOTE=HussainAli;193823][FONT=Verdana]Dear Advocate Khan, Many thanks for the info, would appreciate more if you could provide the section /Law quoted in your post please this will help every one of us.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana] [/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Best Regards[/FONT][/QUOTE]\n\nDear Hussain bro, unfortunately there is no specific rule, law and procedure in this country, that should specifically and unequivocally apply to this particular situation. What info I have given in my post is entirely based on my little experience which I have for the last 12 years as criminal lawyer. During this period I have been dealing only with criminal cases where procedures taken by the government authorities are regulated by the CrPC i.e. Criminal Procedure Code and other relevant laws like the Arms Ordinance. But there is no specific law on that. Laws and procedures are there for acts of government authorities and citizens that needs to be regulated. If an act of either a government authority or citizen does not need to be regulated so obviously there is no need for any law or procedure to come in place. As the taking custody of the weapon by the Police or the Arms Dealer is out of question in this case therefore there is no office procedure or legal procedure to cover that. Laws are made to regulate acts that needs to be regulated and not vice versa.\n\nBased on the criminal laws I have read and practised, I say that a weapon remains a legal weapon and the owner remains the legal and lawful owner even if its license is for some reason under process with any government authority and therefore the legal owner can without doubt keep it in his possession. An expired license of a weapon does not entirely make it illegal to carry the weapon in such circumstances. It is an established fact that a duly issued but expired license could be made legal by paying the required fee i.e. by renewing it. While on the contrary a weapon without a license is unlawful as well as illegal to carry. Therefore Police is not authorised by law to keep other people&#8217;s weapons in this case other than if a person has committed any criminal offense and the Police officer authorised had reason to believe that this person has used the weapon in question while committing the offence, then in this situation Police can take cognizance of the suspect and the weapons if recovered from him.\n\nThe general procedures taken by the DCO Arms Branch or Interior Ministry related to arms, come within the framework of law but is actually not related to a particular law or legal procedure that has to be followed for doing certain acts. All their acts are office procedures though within the legal framework.\nKind Regards,', ''),

(374099, 'Hammerli Walther Olympia .22LR Pistol I finally acquired Hammerli Walther Olympia .22LR handgun yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt was a handgun manufactured by Hammerli Walther as an improvement on the earlier Walther Target Model. It was chambered for the .22 Long Rifle, and a few chambered for the .22 Short. It was produced to equip the German team for the Berlin Olympic Games of 1936 for the rapid fire events. The Olympia design had a fixed barrel, open-topped slide and internal hammer. The Olympia had a large contoured wooden grip, which extended well below the bottom of the butt frame causing the necessity of the magazine bottom plate to be fitted with a wooden block extension.\r\n\r\nThe Walther Olympia is considered, in terms of design, accuracy and finish, to be one of the finest target automatic pistols ever produced. The frame underside of this pistol is drilled for counter weights, with the barrel underside grooved for counter weights (both weights are missing). Adjustable front and rear sights, a safety lever located below the magazine release on the left side of the frame, and two-piece checkered walnut grips with a thumb rest on the left panel. \r\n\r\nMine is made in Switzerland. It is collectors firearm but in excellent working condition. It has match trigger, Fixed Front and Adjustable Rear sights, excellent bore, excellent grips, 8.25'''' barrel, Crown N proofed, with barrel weight, frame is drilled for counter weights, a muzzle brake/compensator is also attached. It came with a wood base magazine.\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3952[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3954[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3950[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3949[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3953[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3948[/ATTACH]', ''),

In those Dhans Snakeheads (SOL) are abundant. But the size of the Snakehead which probably you have caught on a spoon is very good and this size is not very common in those Dhans.\n\nI hunt and fish as well and I am also a member of PGFA where you have also reported this catch of yours. Its surely an outstanding catch in reference to Ravi and its Dhans.\n\nComing from Lahore after crossing Head Balloki turn immediately right and go on the Bund track till you cross spur No. 6 on your right, go straight on the same track and you will see a small lake on your right, its a good spot for fishing and someone was telling me that Fisheries Dept. has reserved this lake for angling only. May be you have already caught this Sol from the same lake, because your description of the spot mathches this lake. At this time of the year River Ravi is connected to this lake.\n\nLater at the end of Monsoon season, try your luck downstream at Head Balloki upto late September or early October. \n\nBut I would advise you to explore other spots like Ganda Singh Wala at River Sutlaj, but it requires contacts to reach there since its located on the Indo-Pak border or try to reach Mangla Dam, a beautiful lake with clean pollution free water, which is currently my destination for fishing as well.\n\nWish you good luck.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nthanks a lot, borther:\ni had gone to Ganda Singh Wala  ,there have alot of rohu and catfish, but not have snakehead fish and masheer , last time i am fishing in there use a single rod (with out reels) catch more than 30 rohus and totaly more than 40kg, some i give the local people, and the small one all is let it back to river, the local people use some materials to cat this fish ,but not useing a good way, if you want i will show you how to use a single rod to catch this kind of fish.\nthanks again for your kindly infromation. hope next time go for fishing with you!!\nxiu', ''),

The PT1911 is a great gun and the best value for money under 100,000. I love mine and will hang on to it for quite a while. It''s softer checking, longer barrel, guide rod make firing it more managable on the range. The commander however is easier to carry and even conceal which is next to impossible with a regular 1911.\n\n@12G Kamanwali was right on, one less edge to get stuck when drawing from concealment, less obvious while concealed and of course adds to the commander''s looks. \n\n@Aquarius To tell you the truth I only tried it with one mag but had no issues with the slide not locking. I do however experience that with some of my 9''s but that''s always due to the ammo I am using. For example the Tula rounds will not lock the slide back 8 times out of 10 but Barnaul or S&B will always do. \n\n@Zeeshan DW has various models and from the ones I''ve seen almost all have better build quality than Colt or Kimber. Only the Valor series however I think is comparable to the mid range models of Les Baer and very much on the same level as Para Ordinance.  \n\nI must also say that apart from the obvious improvements between the two, the difference between a high end Les Baer custom and the DW Valor will only be apparent after perhaps 15,000 or 20,000 rounds over a decade or two of use. Both will work and shoot great but the Les Baer should have more or less the same ultra tight fitting while the DW might shoot half an inch from the center at 15 M.', ''),

Don''t sell the DW till the GTG as I will be bringing my Colt Commander (tailored to my needs) with me.\n\n@Aquarius - I have had similar problems with the 1911 last round hold open feature... easily corrected when I removed the rubber slide buffer from the guide rod.  As for DW can''t say.\n\nOverall this IS a great gun value for money from a company famous for making revolvers and then finding its way into financial problems which they seem to have corrected.  The only thing I must say I find appealing on this setup is the finish.  I, after having all the work done on my Colt could not get a good finish done as there is none available here in Pakistan.  So I did the next best thing for a very very cheap price - I got it auto painted and the finish has thus far lasted me three years at a cost that I can get it refinished very other month if necessary.  One can use NP3 or hard chrome or what ever - paint is the best metal protector.  The question then arises as to whats the most durable paint thats where the difference lies.\n\n@Abbas - Bhai, you are an expert of applying mirch... Lols.

Shaheen cartridge would be a better choice with IC choke? because i have yet to give (#6 std shell + IC choke) a try!\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/Standing-waterSwamp.jpg[/IMG][/QUOTE]\n\n\n\n@ Franci Brother i always hold you high as far as duck shooting is concerned. You are asking a very simple query. \n\n\nFirst formation :\n\nDecoys setup has deployed in marshes areas.  There''s a water pond rounded by dense marshes, in these circumstances you need to put small groups of decoys in most areas (Depending upon number of decoys) with an empty landing zone in front of you (with least decoys). This design is very effective because ducks can approach the pond from any side which often happens during hunting in marshes area. This setup will cover the maximum vision to birds approaching from any side, so nothing strange in this spread................ Good Idea Though.\n\nSecond Image :\n\nIts open reservoir big water pond or river side like any head works or lake etc. Ducks will approach you against the wind right from where the floater are deployed. There''s a thin quantity of decoys (just to give a cover) are placed after floater to landing zone but other side is compact completely because we allow birds to land right in front of use. Wind is blowing L-R which will insist decoying birds to approach against it with slow flight to land right at land zone set for them ............ BANG ........... Good show again, i love it, franci, excellent idea.\n\n\nIf you ask me the perfect match over such a splendid setup i will go with 8# in any season but its purely matter of choice. if u do not feel comfortable with it, use 6 (any), its works well up to 35 yards range doubtlessly. Over decoys spread i recommend IC in any season, again its matter of personal choice though.\n\nIC, 8# ............ Matchless results ........... \n\nI would like to share here a fact about me .... I am badly addicted to 8# and often my teammates starts shouting at me badly, when my excessive use of 8# starts winging bird in the full sun and recovery becomes a real headache. They often instigate me to shift from 8# to 6 to save time and birds. However, i always believe there''s no such problem due to smaller pallets. It needs a separate discussion.', ''),

If yes then what sort of power its pushing? Just glad you got the FAC version bro.\r\nyeh the S16s is a lovely gun and its one of the quietest PCPs too.

Yes my studies are going pretty good not much more time left before graduation. Yes I became a fan of Weihrauchs the day I shot my HW 80 plus I have bad experiences with British air rifles that is probably the only reason why I stayed away from air arms and Daystate. Well I don''t have a chrono yet will be getting one as soon as Im back, however the gun came with a chrono test from Airguns of Arizona and If memory serves me right it was shooting in the 850 FPS range with heavy pellets, If it keeps giving me sub MOA groups as 50 yards in a prone position im good with it. my Weihrauch is also  FSB (fully shrouded barrel) which has become the norm for almost all new PCP rifles. I also needed to ask you do you know How many air rifles I can take on the airlines with me? Im planing to buy another air rifle for my brother and wanted to know if I am allowed to carry two, also have you found any place to refill the tanks in Lahore ??

An air rifle really forges its shooter into becoming a better shot at a fraction of the cost of a rifle.\r\nNow their is a new contender that is hitting the bulls eye in the air rifle world and its Name is the "EDGUN Matador" probably one of the most interesting rifles I have seen in recent years and such a accurate air rifle that it makes shooting an air rifle at 50+ yards seem easy , Owing its accuracy the the precision Lothar Walther Barrel it is a serious bit of kit for any air rifle enthusiast. The Edgun Matador comes in 3 variants short,standard and long bullpup, all of these variants come in a bullpup configuration, to me the only down side of the gun is the single shot capability however I do hear they are coming up with a solution to that problem, other than that I see it as a good competitor to PCP air rifles such as the Hw100 and other British makes of air rifles such as air arms, thoeben and Daystate. \r\n\r\nTo see what it is capable of check out the following link:\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/user/EdgunUSA[/url]\r\nfor more details:\r\n[url]http://edgun.ru/en/cat/guns.php[/url]', ''),

I would like to inform the viewers that this is a long post and if you don''t feel like reading #1 just go to post #2, though I would highly appreciate if you read through this post and share your experiences. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started out with a Diana 27 that has been in the family for 2 generations and still going strong, I shot my first bird with it at the age of 7 much to the annoyance of my father as he had told me to shoot only thing''s which I wanted to eat. I used to curse that air rifle as it could not kill a chipmunk which used to ravage a "bare" tree back in our village. Due to its failure in not being able to kill anything other than sparrow sized birds at 20 yards and doves at 10 yards, I grew Increasingly anxious to buy a air rifle that could do better and after a year worth of annoying my parents I got a BSA Meteor for my 13th birthday that came for the might sum of 8000 rs back in 2001 when to me 8000 seemed as though it was a truck load of money. I shot the BSA and was not impressed but could not complain as it was certainly better than nothing and a wee bit better than the Diana 27. I shot the BSA for a couple more months before putting it in the gun storage and taking out that mighty old 27 as even though it lacked power it was more accurate then the BSA. \nI still remember the legendary accuracy of that mod 27 as I used to shoot dragon flies hovering over the freshly cut grass in the lawn, to prove further improve my accuracy I used to tell our Guard to pick a dragon fly and I would shoot it and I would be successful most of the time. After this I was handed a .22lr rifle when we used to go to our village and since ammo was 5rs per round I used to shoot 50 bullets per day for at least 2 weeks at a time and as the price kept climbing that number kept decreasing, I honestly never though I will ever touch an air rifle again\nBut then 22lr ammo got to rs10 and a lot less ammo was available so it was time to get back to the air rifle and this time it would be another timeless air rifle by Diana &#8220;The mod 35&#8221; this particular air rifle was bought by my chacha in the late 70s early 80s and has since then been put in the store luckily it was still within my reach and I took it out, on further examination of gun it was in pristine condition with a bit of ware on the bluing I immediately took it to one of the best gun smiths in Lahore &#8220;Haji Ikram&#8221; in Dyyal  singh mansion and asked him to put the best spring available in the gun luckily he had a genuine Diana spring available.\n I got the Diana 35 back after 4 days and as soon as I got it mounted a Simmons 3-9x40 on it and after a bit of zeroing started shooting pigeons out to 30-50 yards I was impressed with the capabilities of this medium powered air rifle and it in return further solidified my respect for air rifles with its incredible accuracy. In-between these years my Parents got posted to China which does not happen to be the perfect place for an air gun lover like me, for 4 years I lived by shooting cheap air soft guns which too are a pain in the back to find in china.\n I would go crazy whenever we went back to Pakistan for vacations as once I got back home I would shoot the air rifles all day long. During my last year in China I became friends with a kid who had just come from the US he got to know about my love for guns and told me he had snuck a gamo air rifle in from the US but didn&#8217;t know any details about it&#8230;.. \nlike a beggar after a coin I begged him to show me the gun and I wanted to buy it so he sent me some pics and it turned out to be a Gamo delta &#8220; something I would never buy but considering the circumstances I had to&#8221; I shot that for the rest of the time I was in China and moved and after finishing high school and moving back to Pakistan it was a great sigh of relief , One day my Chacha &#8220; who I blame for addicting me to guns and hunting&#8221; asked me what is a good air rifle to buy, having heard of the legendary accuracy of the Weihrauch I did some research and told him that the HW80 is one of the best springers that is well suited for Pakistan as the Hw90 has a Gas Ram system and I didn&#8217;t know if it would be easily repairable in Pakistan. \nLow and behold a couple of weeks later the weihrauch Hw80 had arrived and what a beauty of an air rifle it was, it out shined any other air rifle that I had previously touched. This was my first Magnum springer and the rifle that really taught me to respect air rifles just as I would respect a firearm  the Hw80 was such a deadly air rifle that it could knock a crow down stone cold dead at 70 yards which I measured later with a Bushnell yardage pro laser range finder. \nSince then I have bought a weihrauch HW100 and am planning on sticking to buying magnum air rifles instead of fire arms till need be .', ''),

In those days there were hardly any decent air guns available in Pakistan. My dad gave me a .177 air rifle and a .177 air pistol. Both were made in England. I used to wait for the summer holidays to begin so I could start my hunting out in the country. On every hunting trip I used  to bring back home pigeons. I used both guns so much that they wore out. There was no "karigar" in Bahawapur that could repair them. I was sad for a long time. I left BWP in 1953. My love for air rifles has not faded even though I have been into rimfire and center fire guns.  You bring back old memories. \r\n\r\nThanks  for sharing your side.

(356091, 'Peep Sights Open rear sights came into use centuries ago. Nothing fancy - just a spring steel ramp with a sliding stepper to elevate or lower the common V/U opening. The only usable/meaningful improvement was a slider ramp with about twenty graduations for indication of elevation setting - not a precise mechanism, in most cases requiring a screwdriver for adjustment.\n \nCompetition shooters have long known the benefits that peep sights offer - refined adjustment of 1/4 MOA (1/4 inch at 100 yrds) or even finer adjustment capability. Add to this the even more important necessity - repeatability. You can move the elevation/windage knobs up and down and be able to come back to the original setting, if needed. This exceptional benefits is derived from the fact that these sights are the micrometer-type, based on precisely threaded screws that are used to move the elevation and windage directions. Repeatability of of this level is not available in optical sights - no matter if they cost thousands of dollars. You can have the optical manufacturers claim debunked by asking if their elevation/windage is based on precise threaded screws.\n \nOpen sights require alignment of rear sight to the front sight and both sights in turn to the target. With peep sight you only need to align the front sight to the target and pull the trigger. With a peep sight, the eye instinctively centers itself in the peep hole - thus requiring only the alignment of the front sight to the target.\n \nMany rifles come drilled and tapped to accept commercial peep sights. Sights are also available for receiver bases that are customarily used for mounting optical sights. Over the years I have used Lyman and Williams peep sights with delight. Try a rifle with peep sight. Shift the elevation/windage knob just one click and see the resulting minute impact point movement on the target. You will be impressed what a peep sight has to offer.\n \nRelated Posts:\nApril 3, 2011 "Move Rifle Rear Sight One Mark/Notch - Change of Impact Point by How Much?"\nApril 15, 201 1"Peep this Sight"', ''),

(355730, ' dear brothers,\ni am also giving here my experience and my opionion and for your information. experience is experience and un experience in un experience.\nIn my opinion the placement of duck decoys is an often overlooked\ndetails of duck hunters. When driving out of the marsh I often see \nsome sad looking decoy spreads that fail to attract and center up \nbirds into killing range. \n \nFollow these tips the next time you set your decoy spread and you\nwill kill more ducks!\n \n[B]1. Set your decoys properly[/B]\nProper placement of duck decoys is not as simple as just tossing\nout decoys within shotgun range. The species of ducks you are\ntargeting, and their natural decoying tendencies play a large role\non how you set your spread. \n \nPuddle ducks prefer to land in calm water on the outside edge of\nyour decoy spread. \n \nducks will typically fly over distant individual decoys and land toward the front of your spread. \n \nSo, by proper placement of duck decoys, we mean your spread should\nbe set out properly for the type of bird you are targeting. \nPlace both your diver and puddle duck spread\nwithin shotgun range, and string out some diver duck decoys up to\n100 yards for increased visibility.\n \n[B]2. Realism kills![/B]\nA realistic and well placed decoy spread results in more ducks\ntaking a closer look at your decoy spread, and therefore will\nconvert to increased harvest for your hunting party.\n \nA properly placed decoy spread requires less decoys to attract\nducks than an improperly placed decoy spread.\n \nIf you can attract ducks over fewer decoys, you can be a more\nmobile hunter because you have less decoys to put out and take down\nevery time a change in hunting location is made.\n \n[I]Increased mobility equals more ducks![/I] \n \n[B]3. Decoy Location is key[/B]\nLocation plays the most vital role in your duck\ndecoy placement. Hunting in a spot where ducks do not want to be\nwill result in poor success. Scouting is how you perfect the art of\nlocation.\n \nThe number of ducks you kill each year is proportional to\nhow much you scout. If you hunt in a duck club, and have limited\nchoice in your location, you still have a choice. It might only be\nbetween blind one and blind two, but you still have a choice.\nChoose wisely by scouting before the hunt.\n \n[B]4. Create a Landing Zone[/B]\nLeaving a landing zone in your decoy spread will\nhelp you control where decoying ducks will be focusing their attention.\n \nA landing zone consists of a 10 yard open ended circle\nwhere the open end is on the side where decoying ducks make their\nfinal approach. Since ducks decoy into the wind, the down wind edge\nis always open. As the season progresses and the flocks of ducks\nyou are seeing are larger, expanding the size of your landing zone\nincrease success.\n \n[B]5. Use as few decoys as you need[/B]\nThe more decoys you put out, the more you have to pick up and the\nless mobile you are. Less mobility equals less kills. Use as few\ndecoys as necessary. \n \nThe later in the duck season you are hunting, the larger the flocks\nof ducks you will see. This means you will have to increase the\nnumber of decoys in your spread to appear natural. \n \nAs the decoy numbers increase, proper placement of duck decoys becomes critical. \n \nIf you place them out of shotgun range the mallards will be landing outside your spread.\n \n[B]6. Watch the competition[/B] \nThe more competition in your hunting area, the more or less decoys\nyou will need. You want your spread to be different. \n \nGiven a choice late in the year I would rather have a larger spread than the guy hunting next to me. But, if hunting pressure is very high, a small\nspread could be the key to success. \n \n[B]7. Decoy Spread Shape[/B]\nThe shape of your decoy spread is critical when running a large decoy\nspread for migrating late season ducks.\n \nEarly in the year duck decoy spreads are typically small and\nplacing them out of range is not an issue. But when you increase \nthe decoy numbers to two hundred plus decoys and keeping them in \nshotgun range becomes difficult. Run them very tight and very \nclose to the blind, and do not forget the landing zone.\n \nIf you follow the tips outlined above, you will start killing more\nbirds.', ''),

As for big game .177 .22 are not the only calibers available for air rifles in recent years big bore air rifles have started to be researched on as replacements in countries where firearms are not allowed.

(355791, ' [QUOTE=mallard;194471]dear brothers,\ni am also giving here my experience and my opionion and for your information. experience is experience and un experience in un experience.\nIn my opinion the placement of duck decoys is an often overlooked\ndetails of duck hunters. When driving out of the marsh I often see \nsome sad looking decoy spreads that fail to attract and center up \nbirds into killing range. \n \nFollow these tips the next time you set your decoy spread and you\nwill kill more ducks!\n \n[B]1. Set your decoys properly[/B]\nProper placement of duck decoys is not as simple as just tossing\nout decoys within shotgun range. The species of ducks you are\ntargeting, and their natural decoying tendencies play a large role\non how you set your spread. \n \nPuddle ducks prefer to land in calm water on the outside edge of\nyour decoy spread. \n \nducks will typically fly over distant individual decoys and land toward the front of your spread. \n \nSo, by proper placement of duck decoys, we mean your spread should\nbe set out properly for the type of bird you are targeting. \nPlace both your diver and puddle duck spread\nwithin shotgun range, and string out some diver duck decoys up to\n100 yards for increased visibility.\n \n[B]2. Realism kills![/B]\nA realistic and well placed decoy spread results in more ducks\ntaking a closer look at your decoy spread, and therefore will\nconvert to increased harvest for your hunting party.\n \nA properly placed decoy spread requires less decoys to attract\nducks than an improperly placed decoy spread.\n \nIf you can attract ducks over fewer decoys, you can be a more\nmobile hunter because you have less decoys to put out and take down\nevery time a change in hunting location is made.\n \n[I]Increased mobility equals more ducks![/I] \n \n[B]3. Decoy Location is key[/B]\nLocation plays the most vital role in your duck\ndecoy placement. Hunting in a spot where ducks do not want to be\nwill result in poor success. Scouting is how you perfect the art of\nlocation.\n \nThe number of ducks you kill each year is proportional to\nhow much you scout. If you hunt in a duck club, and have limited\nchoice in your location, you still have a choice. It might only be\nbetween blind one and blind two, but you still have a choice.\nChoose wisely by scouting before the hunt.\n \n[B]4. Create a Landing Zone[/B]\nLeaving a landing zone in your decoy spread will\nhelp you control where decoying ducks will be focusing their attention.\n \nA landing zone consists of a 10 yard open ended circle\nwhere the open end is on the side where decoying ducks make their\nfinal approach. Since ducks decoy into the wind, the down wind edge\nis always open. As the season progresses and the flocks of ducks\nyou are seeing are larger, expanding the size of your landing zone\nincrease success.\n \n[B]5. Use as few decoys as you need[/B]\nThe more decoys you put out, the more you have to pick up and the\nless mobile you are. Less mobility equals less kills. Use as few\ndecoys as necessary. \n \nThe later in the duck season you are hunting, the larger the flocks\nof ducks you will see. This means you will have to increase the\nnumber of decoys in your spread to appear natural. \n \nAs the decoy numbers increase, proper placement of duck decoys becomes critical. \n \nIf you place them out of shotgun range the mallards will be landing outside your spread.\n \n[B]6. Watch the competition[/B] \nThe more competition in your hunting area, the more or less decoys\nyou will need. You want your spread to be different. \n \nGiven a choice late in the year I would rather have a larger spread than the guy hunting next to me. But, if hunting pressure is very high, a small\nspread could be the key to success. \n \n[B]7. Decoy Spread Shape[/B]\nThe shape of your decoy spread is critical when running a large decoy\nspread for migrating late season ducks.\n \nEarly in the year duck decoy spreads are typically small and\nplacing them out of range is not an issue. But when you increase \nthe decoy numbers to two hundred plus decoys and keeping them in \nshotgun range becomes difficult. Run them very tight and very \nclose to the blind, and do not forget the landing zone.\n \nIf you follow the tips outlined above, you will start killing more\nbirds.[/QUOTE]\n\nMy dear Mallard Brother.

Set your decoys properly[/B]\nProper placement of duck decoys is not as simple as just tossing\nout decoys within shotgun range. The species of ducks you are\ntargeting, and their natural decoying tendencies play a large role\non how you set your spread. \n \nPuddle ducks prefer to land in calm water on the outside edge of\nyour decoy spread. \n \nducks will typically fly over distant individual decoys and land toward the front of your spread. \n \nSo, by proper placement of duck decoys, we mean your spread should\nbe set out properly for the type of bird you are targeting. \nPlace both your diver and puddle duck spread\nwithin shotgun range, and string out some diver duck decoys up to\n100 yards for increased visibility.\n \n[B]2. Realism kills![/B]\nA realistic and well placed decoy spread results in more ducks\ntaking a closer look at your decoy spread, and therefore will\nconvert to increased harvest for your hunting party.\n \nA properly placed decoy spread requires less decoys to attract\nducks than an improperly placed decoy spread.\n \nIf you can attract ducks over fewer decoys, you can be a more\nmobile hunter because you have less decoys to put out and take down\nevery time a change in hunting location is made.\n \n[I]Increased mobility equals more ducks![/I] \n \n[B]3. Decoy Location is key[/B]\nLocation plays the most vital role in your duck\ndecoy placement. Hunting in a spot where ducks do not want to be\nwill result in poor success. Scouting is how you perfect the art of\nlocation.\n \nThe number of ducks you kill each year is proportional to\nhow much you scout. If you hunt in a duck club, and have limited\nchoice in your location, you still have a choice. It might only be\nbetween blind one and blind two, but you still have a choice.\nChoose wisely by scouting before the hunt.\n \n[B]4. Create a Landing Zone[/B]\nLeaving a landing zone in your decoy spread will\nhelp you control where decoying ducks will be focusing their attention.\n \nA landing zone consists of a 10 yard open ended circle\nwhere the open end is on the side where decoying ducks make their\nfinal approach. Since ducks decoy into the wind, the down wind edge\nis always open. As the season progresses and the flocks of ducks\nyou are seeing are larger, expanding the size of your landing zone\nincrease success.\n \n[B]5. Use as few decoys as you need[/B]\nThe more decoys you put out, the more you have to pick up and the\nless mobile you are. Less mobility equals less kills. Use as few\ndecoys as necessary. \n \nThe later in the duck season you are hunting, the larger the flocks\nof ducks you will see. This means you will have to increase the\nnumber of decoys in your spread to appear natural. \n \nAs the decoy numbers increase, proper placement of duck decoys becomes critical. \n \nIf you place them out of shotgun range the mallards will be landing outside your spread.\n \n[B]6. Watch the competition[/B] \nThe more competition in your hunting area, the more or less decoys\nyou will need. You want your spread to be different. \n \nGiven a choice late in the year I would rather have a larger spread than the guy hunting next to me.

A bit of a stretch perhaps, but there''s no doubt that the M1 was the first successful semiautomatic rifle issued in any quantity that had the ruggedness and accuracy to dominate the battlefield.

Its short bolt action cocked on closing, and its muzzle cap prevented dirt from clogging the weapon.

I would never ask a person whom I dont trust or an un reliable arms dealer in this particular case.\n\nAs I mentioned in my earlier posts that the conversion to All Pakistan does take sometime, as the application is forwarded from the DCO office license branch to the SO Arms at the Home Dept.\n\nI made my application to convert my license to All Pakistan 10 days ago and went today to the DCO office license branch to inquire about it. I was handed over a list of about 300 persons whose application have been approved, but my name was not there. The clerk replied that you can inquire about yours in August. As the list he handed over to me was of the applicants who have applied two months ago.\n\nWhile submitting the application I wanted to have it go through the normal routine process, but am surprised today to hear that mine would possibly come up with a decision in August. I have no other option but to request my cousin to follow it up with the Home Secretary Azmat Hanif who happens to be his close friend. Normally I do not prefer to ask people for favours specially relatives but have no way out. There could be ban on the conversion any time.\n\nI also could have gone through my legal clerk to struck an under table deal with the Arms Branch staff but I think that it is always good to go through the routine process of the application, submit the fee in the bank and get the license converted, atleast you are satisfied that your license is stamped with the official and original stamp of the relevant government authority and is not fake.\n\nIt is always good to ask some one reliable to follow it for you if you cannot possibly do it yourself.', ''),

(355954, '22LR - Importance of Ranging Ranging is the act of judging or estimating distance. We may say that the target is in the range of 75 yards - meaning, it is approximately that distance. Why is ranging important in shooting 22LRs? This is due to the tiny size of the cartridge that holds very little propellant (powder) - about 1.8-2 grains or 117-130 milligrams.\r\n\r\nLet us take a high velocity 22LR cartridge with 40-grain bullet and muzzle velocity of 1,255 feet per second. When fired, the bullet will stay within about 1.6 inches up to 95 yards with the zero-set distance of 80 yards. Depending on the target size, shooting at longer distances requires proper aiming adjustment of the open rear sight or optical sight. This compensation adjustment can be carried out if the distance to target is known or estimated/judged with certain degree of acceptable tolerance.\r\n\r\nJudging distance without any mechanical aid requires practice.

(355963, ' [QUOTE=mallard;194471]dear brothers,\r\ni am also giving here my experience and my opionion and for your information. experience is experience and un experience in un experience.\r\nIn my opinion the placement of duck decoys is an often overlooked\r\ndetails of duck hunters. When driving out of the marsh I often see \r\nsome sad looking decoy spreads that fail to attract and center up \r\nbirds into killing range. \r\n \r\nFollow these tips the next time you set your decoy spread and you\r\nwill kill more ducks!\r\n \r\n[B]1. Set your decoys properly[/B]\r\nProper placement of duck decoys is not as simple as just tossing\r\nout decoys within shotgun range. The species of ducks you are\r\ntargeting, and their natural decoying tendencies play a large role\r\non how you set your spread. \r\n \r\nPuddle ducks prefer to land in calm water on the outside edge of\r\nyour decoy spread. \r\n \r\nducks will typically fly over distant individual decoys and land toward the front of your spread. \r\n \r\nSo, by proper placement of duck decoys, we mean your spread should\r\nbe set out properly for the type of bird you are targeting. \r\nPlace both your diver and puddle duck spread\r\nwithin shotgun range, and string out some diver duck decoys up to\r\n100 yards for increased visibility.\r\n \r\n[B]2. Realism kills![/B]\r\nA realistic and well placed decoy spread results in more ducks\r\ntaking a closer look at your decoy spread, and therefore will\r\nconvert to increased harvest for your hunting party.\r\n \r\nA properly placed decoy spread requires less decoys to attract\r\nducks than an improperly placed decoy spread.\r\n \r\nIf you can attract ducks over fewer decoys, you can be a more\r\nmobile hunter because you have less decoys to put out and take down\r\nevery time a change in hunting location is made.\r\n \r\n[I]Increased mobility equals more ducks![/I] \r\n \r\n[B]3. Decoy Location is key[/B]\r\nLocation plays the most vital role in your duck\r\ndecoy placement. Hunting in a spot where ducks do not want to be\r\nwill result in poor success. Scouting is how you perfect the art of\r\nlocation.\r\n \r\nThe number of ducks you kill each year is proportional to\r\nhow much you scout. If you hunt in a duck club, and have limited\r\nchoice in your location, you still have a choice. It might only be\r\nbetween blind one and blind two, but you still have a choice.\r\nChoose wisely by scouting before the hunt.\r\n \r\n[B]4. Create a Landing Zone[/B]\r\nLeaving a landing zone in your decoy spread will\r\nhelp you control where decoying ducks will be focusing their attention.\r\n \r\nA landing zone consists of a 10 yard open ended circle\r\nwhere the open end is on the side where decoying ducks make their\r\nfinal approach. Since ducks decoy into the wind, the down wind edge\r\nis always open. As the season progresses and the flocks of ducks\r\nyou are seeing are larger, expanding the size of your landing zone\r\nincrease success.\r\n \r\n[B]5. Use as few decoys as you need[/B]\r\nThe more decoys you put out, the more you have to pick up and the\r\nless mobile you are. Less mobility equals less kills. Use as few\r\ndecoys as necessary. \r\n \r\nThe later in the duck season you are hunting, the larger the flocks\r\nof ducks you will see. This means you will have to increase the\r\nnumber of decoys in your spread to appear natural. \r\n \r\nAs the decoy numbers increase, proper placement of duck decoys becomes critical. \r\n \r\nIf you place them out of shotgun range the mallards will be landing outside your spread.\r\n \r\n[B]6. Watch the competition[/B] \r\nThe more competition in your hunting area, the more or less decoys\r\nyou will need. You want your spread to be different. \r\n \r\nGiven a choice late in the year I would rather have a larger spread than the guy hunting next to me. But, if hunting pressure is very high, a small\r\nspread could be the key to success. \r\n \r\n[B]7. Decoy Spread Shape[/B]\r\nThe shape of your decoy spread is critical when running a large decoy\r\nspread for migrating late season ducks.\r\n \r\nEarly in the year duck decoy spreads are typically small and\r\nplacing them out of range is not an issue. But when you increase \r\nthe decoy numbers to two hundred plus decoys and keeping them in \r\nshotgun range becomes difficult. Run them very tight and very \r\nclose to the blind, and do not forget the landing zone.\r\n \r\nIf you follow the tips outlined above, you will start killing more\r\nbirds.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nThats what these duck addicts need in off season mallard brother keep it up.....', ''),

Later Dreyse guns adopted by the Prussian army were rifles using self-contained combustible cartridges holding oblong lead balls held in a papier-mache "sabot".\nFrom 1848 onwards the new weapon was gradually introduced into Prussian service.

(355975, ' Prince, your highness, \nA very well researched nice and informative write up.\nThe Mauser 98 is  the grand daddy of all modern bolt action rifles. \nIn the last 113 years lots of efforts were made to  improve upon it but most hit the dust, the proof is that in Africa when you are in a Big Five camp the rifles you find are all Mauser 1898s or rifles based on this action, with its Controlled Feed, non Rotating Claw Extractor and gas shield this is the only rifle you will want when an animal of the fury of a leopard, the malice of a Cape bufaloe or the brute anger of a lion is on the cards.\nThe M16 has been deliberately down rated by the US forces so that others do not follow the  path. The newer ones  (last 25 years ) with the improved ammunition (62) grain green tip and propellants with less fouling and improved internal design and metallurgy and sharper rifling twists changed from 1 in 12 to 1 in 7 inches and 9 inches have improved the rifle immensely, it remains a very effective combat rifle. The caliber is likely to change to 6.8 mm, in fact thousands of rifles are already issued to infantry with the new SPC 6.8 mm (Special Purpose Cartridge) it is very light in weight, it is of a moduller design, one can change barrel length or even calibers ( within limits) easily, the butt, the fore end can be changed easily and various types of Night Sights or Telescopes attached to it or removed in seconds.\nThe Pre 1964 Winchester Model 70 and its later edition The Pre 64 Classic also deserve a mention amongst the top rifles as it was a nearly true copy of the Mauser 1898. The discussion is about Rifles and not only military rifles.\nAgain the CZs VZ 24  (discontinued )and the later models are excellent rifles based on the Mauser 98.\nThe Blaser R 8 and R 93 also deserve a mention, though not so popular because of the prohibitive price.\nThe Japanese Arisaka also deserves a mention being the strongest military action and the caliber 75 years ago was 6.8 which is the same bullet dia as a .270.\nOnce again Prince sahab a very informative write up', ''),

(381057, ' @Mig\nThe law is very clear as to what your actions should be. It''s a simple 3 step course: Observe, evaluate, act. Plain and simple.\nFor example you''re sleeping when suddenly you hear a slight noise coming from another part of the house. You immediately grab your your SD/HD weapon, make sure it''s loaded and ready to go. Also grab your mobile phone with you and put it on "Silent". You then quietly make your way to the part of the house where you think you heard the noise from. You get in a concealed position and [B]observe[/B] that it''s a thief who''s broken in and is busy stuffing his pockets wit whatever he can grab in your home. You silently look around to check whether the burglar is alone or not. Seeing that he''s alone, you try to see if he''s armed or not.\nYou make a little noise of your own (or rack the slide of your weapon loudly if you really want to scare him) in order to [B]evaluate[/B] the threat level and, while still hidden, closely observe his reaction. If he''s armed, he''ll instinctively pull out his own weapon and start scanning the area. If he''s unarmed, he''ll appear to be on the verge of panicking. In either case, his top priority will be to get the hell out ASAP.\nNow it''s time to [B]act[/B]. If he''s unarmed, you immediately turn the lights on, reveal yourself and track the gun at the thief. Warn him firmly that if he moves you will not hesitate to pull the trigger. While keeping the gun on him, call the police with your cell phone and then call your neighbors for backup/support. On the other hand if he''s armed, keep the lights off and give a loud and firm verbal warning and tell him to drop his weapon or you''ll open fire. If he surrenders, turn on the lights, call the police and your neighbors. If he opens fire, return fire and shoot to kill.', ''),

(355991, ' [QUOTE=PakistanFirst;193443]Center fire rifle shooters can custom load ammo to achieve peak accuracy. With 22LR, we are at a disadvantage - we can not custom load our ammo. All we can do it to try different type of ammo to get better results.\n\nWhen we pull the trigger, the propellant (powder) ignites and the bullet starts to move and it starts vibrations in the barrel. The idea is to minimize or eliminate these vibrations. Different techniques have been developed and tried. The easiest method is one that costs no money.\n\nFirst, fire five shot on your target. Now, try this. Loosen the front bolt that hold the stock and the barrel. Take a business card and insert it between the stock and the barrel - in front of the bolt. Now tighten the bolt - same as before. If after tightening the bolt you find that the business card is lose between the stock and the barrel, loosen the bolt and take out the card. Now fold the card in two, and again insert it and tighten the bolt with the same torque. You may have to try more than one card to get started.\n\nNow you are ready to do the testing. Fire five shots on a new target. Compare the first and the second target. See any improvement? You can repeat this process of inserting another card couple of times. No one can tell you if your results will improve or not. All you can do is to try this method.[/QUOTE]\n This is no doubt a great and quick method of accurising an in- accurate rifle in a hurry, the rifle barrel is under pressure and pushed up wards. \nThis how ever  has a down side, you could practically tell the weather by shooting a group with a pressure bedded rifle, if it has a wooden stock.\nChange in humidity and temperature causes the wood to expand and shrink (Warp) and although it may continue shooting good groups it will have a WANDERING ZERO shifting every day or every few days according to the  weather.\nThe best would be to have the action Glass Bedded ( The net is full of information on how to do it ) and the barrel free floated.\nThe bedding can be done with epoxies available at stores in Pakistan. Remember to have all metal parts waxed with car polish and holes and trigger parts covered in plastercine ; if you don''t you will have your rifle barrel and action permanently stuck  to the stock. You will have an accurate rifle with no need to Zeroe frequently.', ''),

(356038, 'Review: TAURUS PT-1911 after 500 Rounds! Salam, \n\nI purchased the PT-1911 a few months back, trying to understand what the fuss was all about the .45 ACP. Today, I''ve completed the 500 round mark with my PT-1911 and now I truly understand what the fuss was all about ;)\n\nNo wonder the American''s favor the .45 because it''s just a damn fun round to shoot! I''m a sold customer of the .45 and frankly, I''m going to cut down on my 9mm shooting because compared to the .45, it''s not that fun! \n\nLet''s get down to the review and range report, shall we? \n\n[img]http://i53.tinypic.com/5uld7c.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Model: TAURUS PT-1911 (Matte) All-steel\nProduction: FEB 2011\nTotal rounds fired: 500+\nNumber of FTE: 0\nNumber of FTF: 0\nNumber of FTF (Feed): 0[/b]\n\nOnly available Ammo was Armscor and S&B so I''ve only had the chance to use these two brands through the PT1911.\n\n[b]Initial Impression:[/b]\n\n[video=youtube;gMlnj2OreCM]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMlnj2OreCM[/video]\n\n[b]TARGETS AROUND 250 ROUND COUNT[/b]\n[I]5 shots each except for the first target. That''s 6 shots. 15 Meters. Different aiming techniques[/I]\n\nWorking with different aiming techniques in these targets that''s why they''re all grouped but in different positions. \n\n[U]Target 1; [/U]\n\n[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/rct277.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[u]Target 2; [/u]\n\n[IMG]http://i53.tinypic.com/2mcc7ev.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[u]Target 3; [/u]\n\n[IMG]http://i52.tinypic.com/141m5ah.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThat was the time when I was figuring out this gun and frankly, it was amazing! I''d aim dead center and it''ll give me dead accurate results. I''d aim a little above the center, It''d give me even better results. Point is, the gun''s capable of only shooting 10''s when everything''s followed properly; Grip, stance, breathing control, sight alignment, trigger squeeze and follow through. At times, these things are hard to get 100% in severe heat (:p) so whatever errors you may encounter on your target chart, it''s not the gun, it''s the shooter. \n\n[b]TARGET FROM TODAY - Round Count: 500+[/b]\n\nDistance: [b]15 Meters[/b]\n\n[b]8 Rounds;[/b]\n\n[img]http://i56.tinypic.com/20hx15h.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]12 Rounds (same target); [/b]\n\n[img]http://i55.tinypic.com/14j7u2t.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]20 Rounds (Same target); [/b]\n\n[img]http://i52.tinypic.com/fm14x4.jpg[/img]\n\nI''m really happy with the results. Compared to all the high end 1911''s, Taurus basically gives you more bang for your buck and nothing else. The trigger''s amazing and now that it''s gone through 500+ rounds it''s even better! When shot properly, it doesn''t bite you or hurt your hand, but that trigger finger might give you a bit of pain after a while :P \n\nIf ammo prices were ''decent'' in Pakistan, I''d buy nothing other than .45''s because it''s such an amazing and fun round to shoot, you can''t regret it. \n\n[b]Conclusion; [/b]\n\nFor 75-85k in Pakistan, this is the best 1911 that you can buy. By the performance of it, it''ll keep on rocking for many years to come. Get em'' while they''re hot! :D \n\n[img]http://i54.tinypic.com/156rfw6.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]UPDATE - 15 rounds at 25 meters[/b]\n\n[img]http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/263127_10150247531089168_505654167_7070330_7918689_n.jpg[/img]', ''),

You chill out and I also in meantime finalize my plans for overseas summer trip too. But do not forget to share your secrets of weather forecasting for ducks and maybe decoying tactics (and spreads) as we discussed once here....hehe. And no closet (in or out) ... am currently in F7 sector Isld, and hectic travelling to close up my commitments before I leave for holidays are immense, not to mention the head-spinning heat/humidity during travelling.\r\n\r\nIn the end, as you know too, we have just one common and very simple objective here on forum - to mutually interact by sharing ideas, otherwise you, me and almost every other guy here has his own hunting grounds and hunt strategies. Aur jo thora boht hamein pata hai zaroor share karne ki koshish karte hain yahan.\r\nSo chill and have great summers.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, you are right, this reporting to WLD was true in those days (end 2010 and early 2011). It was very much a common talk among shikaris. But I do not know specifically or pinpointed persons who were the traitors type among shikaris. I guess some petty shikaris for own chaaploosi etc (which we are referring to as informants here) might find some kick in that to score points with the WL authorities. Isn''t it?', '');

(356164, '22LR - Accuracy Really Elusive? We all want our 22LRs to hit the same spot each time we pull the trigger from the same distance. These kinds of guns are known as tack drivers. We can get our tack driver by making the next purchase when we have lot of money in out pocket. The question is - can we get better results from the 22LR we already own?\n\nThe answer to this question may not be all that elusive. It requires a bit of effort and few dozen 22LR cartridges. It is said that 22LR rifles are fussy about the ammo used in them. This is true. Due to the minute manufacturing tolerances, two rifles of the same make and model and manufactured one after the other  can give different results with same ammo type in both guns. This kind of variable is not that we can control.\n\nBut, we can control the type of ammunition we do use in our 22LRs. Here is the strategy. Try as many different type of ammo you can get your hands on. To minimize cost, you can trade some of your ammo with other 22LR shooters to acquire the types you do not have. In the alternative, you can join forces by splitting purchases of ammo types you don''t have into smaller quantities for yourself and friends. You all get to share the cost. You need about five cartridges of each type.\n\nNow, go out and try your ammo collection by firing five-shot groups and compare the target results. You may be surprised to find that there may be an ammo type that makes your gun happy - which in turn makes you a happy shooter.\n\nRelated Posts:\n# 7 Sorting Ammo by Weight\n#13 Same 22LR Ammo - You Got Fantastic Results & I Got Crummy Results\n#16 Muzzle of Your 22LR Rifle May Have the Answer to Question of Accuracy \n#19 Which 22LR Ammo is Best?\n#27 You Discovered Best 22LR Ammo - Really?\n#225 22LR - Rifle Suffer From Accuracy Sickness?\n#226 22LR - Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands\n#233 22LR - Minimizing "Flyer" Shots\n#249 22LR - Cost Nothing but Could Improve Accuracy', ''),

(356183, '22LR - Why Not 22AR? Comparing 22LR with the .22 spring air rifle is like comparing day with night. These are two different animals. Many places, like at this end, an air rifle is not considered a weapon. But, a 22LR is.\r\n\r\nThe commonality is the caliber - essentially the same. The bullet weight of the 22LR is in the 30-40 grains range. The weight of the .22 pellet is in the 5-25 grains range. Balistically. the energy that an air rifle delivers at the muzzle, the 22LR does the same at over 800 yards. \r\n\r\nNowadays air rifles are being advertised with muzzle velocities of over 1,500 feet per second. By using tiny pellets, these claims may be valid. But, the tiny pellets lose their velocity and energy very quickly after leaving the muzzle.  You can use the bullet energy table referenced below to do your own calculations.\r\n\r\nThe 22LR and the 22AR have their right places in the shooting hobby. When hunting for game, it is essential that the kill be humane - quick. Bear this mind when using 22AR , or for that matter, the 22LR.\r\n\r\nRelated  Posts:\r\n#41 22LR - Kill How Far?\r\n#219 22LR - Bullet Energy Table - It Is Free', ''),

(371495, ' Salam All,\nOKAAAY, here goes, I doubt I will be able to cover everything at all.  Forget ergonomics, mainly pistol/rifle accuracy is tested or benchmarked on a ransom rest ( a jig which holds the firearm for firing ) three or more shots are fired and accuracy checked via the grouping.  A fixed barrel on a firearms will always shoot more accurate than a locking lug or similar system firearm.  There is no slide cycling bias guidance to deviate the bullet path.  Some on the other hand have tried a sleeve on the barrel kinda like a ring fitted in the barrel bushing to keep the bullet trajectory in line as much as possible.  Upon firing as the bullet is travelling down the barrel - if there is the slightest part touching any part of the barrel - it in some way or another ends up providing support in that area hence changing the accuracy.  Also there is something called barrel flex.  If one can eliminate barrel flex against the frame and itself AND have a free floating barrel then the groupings will be great.  Hence, you have these heavy bull barrels with firm actions to keep the groupings tight.  I would like to mention the crown at the muzzle but I feel that this is not really important as - if the firearm with a bad crown keeps shooting too far to lets say left then all the groupings will also be there and all one has to do is adjust the scope to bring it to zero.\nDifferent bullet designs, bullet weights, and charges WILL decrease groupings if used in a mix.  Each of these will variations will group differently.  So once zeroed with a specific round expect changes if using different ammo.\n\nIn pistols there are/have been guns which shoot well with fixed barrels... very well like HKp7, HK VP70, Steyr GB, D.E., and there are more like Lugers, broomhandles...\n\nThere are other viable variations which one can state account for more accuracy HOWEVER, I feel that those are individual''s variations.  IE I shot as good with the Browning Hi Power as some of my other so called highly accurate guns and the Hi Power had a bad trigger short barrel (not fixed).  By the same token I can''t shoot worth a damn with a Luger!', ''),

Yes my studies are going pretty good not much more time left before graduation. Yes I became a fan of Weihrauchs the day I shot my HW 80 plus I have bad experiences with British air rifles that is probably the only reason why I stayed away from air arms and Daystate. Well I don''t have a chrono yet will be getting one as soon as Im back, however the gun came with a chrono test from Airguns of Arizona and If memory serves me right it was shooting in the 850 FPS range with heavy pellets, If it keeps giving me sub MOA groups as 50 yards in a prone position im good with it. my Weihrauch is also  FSB (fully shrouded barrel) which has become the norm for almost all new PCP rifles. I also needed to ask you do you know How many air rifles I can take on the airlines with me? Im planing to buy another air rifle for my brother and wanted to know if I am allowed to carry two, also have you found any place to refill the tanks in Lahore ?? I have a FX 3 stage pump and it does reduce time but its just alot better to have a scuba tank as well, would you happen to knwo the availability of scuba tanks in Pakistan?[/QUOTE]\n \nThats great about ur pcp bro.\nAs far as taking airguns on the plane go, it depends on the airline policy if they allow you to carry them or not. Most will be ok as they are classified as sporting equipment and not an assault weapon as such, so best to check with the airline first I know PIA is fine with it. As far as carrying two goes, I dont think there is a limit on the number, I just brought two myself (the two PCPs in the pics above) so as long as the airline allows airguns, i think you should be fine with two. It was lucky I was travelling with family and so I said the other one belongs to my wife :) and no one questioned it. I have the pump too, and it comes very handy. So far I found out that the rifle club in cantt area (think its called lahore rifle club) can fill the tanks. Most other places like BOC in lahore said they can only go upto 2000 PSI. But the guy from Lahore rifle club always seemed busy (didnt sound too keen to talk to a customer) while talking to me on the phone and never really rang me back for a time and day to come and fill my tank (which I also imported with me). So I didnt bother with him again after ringing him a couple of times. I am no beggar and wasnt asking him for a personal favour, was going to pay him for the service too. And he couldnt even stick to one rate, initially he told me 700 to 800 rupees, then i was told during the same conversation that it may be more than a 1000 and then again the amount jumped to 1600 figure. I was wondering if I should carry on talking to the guy and where is he going to end up with his rates!!! Anyway even after agreeing to the undecided rates, the guy wasnt too keen to ring me back and tell me the time and place to go for refilling. So i gathered that my money is better in my pocket than someone elses if ignorance is what I will be paying for mostly....jobs worth really !!!!\nScuba tanks are available from Karachi but last time I asked they were around 35000rs. I think it was from Karachi Scuba centre. But while talking to other engineers at work I fugured that even a CNG tank can be used cos u can get them upto 250 bars I think which is still suitable for most of the PCPs. Like my S16 only needs about 210 bars max. And most of the adapters, fill pipes etc are all available from Brandeth rd in Lahore too. As fas as I know there isnt much diffeence in the molecules of cng and plain air so the seals etc should not be different too. But remember DO NOT FIRE YOUR PCP WITH CNG EVER or with pure oxygen etc. I know you may know this already but just telling any one else who is reading this too. Anyway, I think that CNG tanks can be used as long as u buy a new one and keep good care of it and keep it away from any kind of moisture or corrosive materials. \nHope that helps brother.', ''),

My father was in very happy mode after looking toward the shot.\n\nLater sitting together with my family members, my Father narrated the same event with summing up the session in this mode : \n\n" I have judged him a lot in hunting and i have no doubt in saying that his flying shot is better then mine "\n\nThis is what i have earned as a Hunter and off course cant forget the same throughout my entire life.    \n\nThanks.[/QUOTE]\n \n\n\n\n\n   Bravo  ... ustaaad g .... what a skill ... hats off', ''),

So if your aim is target practice only, then also try to re-confirm from other experts about damage to rifle barrel''s grooving (to have different views), and then use G3 bullets in longer term. Otherwise at serious game (deer or other), G3 bullet is of no use as per my knowledge. \r\n\r\nI have extensively used 7mm Mauser (7x57mm) (140-145 gr) and .270 Winchester (130 gr) - mostly pointed soft nosed ones, but although very expensive and very difficult to find these days, 7mm Remington Magnum calibre is my favorite in the 150 gr - 165 gr range bullet (PSP or better boat-tail or silvertip or ballistic tip).

In this case what is your ethical obligation?\n \nYour ethical obligation is to spend the necessary effort to locate the animal, be it injured or dead.

Ethics also dictate that we place our shot in the vital region of the animal''s body for a humane - quick kill.\n \nWe dutifully followed all these dictates but the animal we hit is not found. Our teaching of ethics tells us that we spend more than just a reasonable effort to locate the animal.

If the hunt involved edible meat, our teaching commands us to retrieve that meat and not let it go to waste.\n \nWhat if lot of effort was spent and the animal was still not found?

(356627, ' [QUOTE=PakistanFirst;195218]You swear your shot hit the animal. You even saw traces of blood on the ground. The animal may be injured or dead. In this case what is your ethical obligation?\n\nYour ethical obligation is to spend  the necessary effort to locate the animal, be it injured or dead. Ethics dictate that we use a gun of the proper caliber and ammunition of the right type for game animal we are to hunt. Ethics also dictate that we place our shot in the vital region of the animal''s body for a humane - quick kill.\n\nWe dutifully followed all these dictates but the animal we hit is not found. Our teaching of ethics tells us that we spend more  than just a reasonable effort to locate the animal. If the animal was injured and not killed  by our shot, we are obligated to end the animal''s suffering by locating it and shooting it again. If the hunt involved edible meat, our teaching commands us to retrieve that meat and not let it go to waste.\n\nWhat if lot of effort was spent and the animal was still not found? There a lesson to be learned by all of us. Next time, we have to be within reasonable shooting range before pulling the trigger. One more thing - we need to learn again about animal anatomy so the next shot we place will land in the vital region with certainty. This may require more time in honing our shooting skills.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear PakistanFirst, very nice / ethical topic u have started, i have a little confusion in mind, do correct me if i am wrong, i think we are talking about the animals only and not birds, as you know retrieving scenario will little change in birds.

In my vacations I went there to Sahiwal and my uncle wanted to see if I was ready to go for hunts.We went to test the guns  ( We had 3 shooting sessions in 3 days). At the rooftops, I took down a crow and kite from my 4 (No.4) Shaheen "Kartoos".It had been a while since my uncle had last hunted and he got nothing of his 4 cartridges. We then took pictures of my first flying shots. When we called it a day, I was congratulated with comments like " Good Shot","Wah ji Wah"," Kiwain jorh kay shot marey way" and all. My Grandpa was also very proud of me ( He is my hunting teacher). The next day we tried the other gun and my reward was that I got 6 cartridges now and Imported ones (Sellier And Bellot,Eley,etc). My uncle got 4 for himself.Again he did some wingers but never got a kill. It was now my turn and guess what, I got 3 or 4 big birds.My uncle said " Tun Changa Shikari ain",that night I got a treat at a good restaurant in Sahiwal. The next day my grandpa was eager to see who is a better hunter presently,me or my mamu. So we took 1 gun each and went upstairs got 10 cartridges the final day and my mamu took 4. Again he was scoreless :D . I got a sitting dove at a distance of about 3 meters with a 30 inch barrel and 4 no cartridge as soon as we started.To my dislike, it was completely destroyed and I couldn''t eat my first game bird with a firearm (not airgun).That was accompanied with a crow and kite. Now my uncle didn''t say anything,he was just smiling at me. We went inside, my grandpa hugged me, and told me that I PASSED the gun safety,shooting,etc tests and I was ready to go on a hunt the next time I came. I was GLAD !

(356902, '@ Skeeter60 Sir. Sir, i think it was an old issue of SWAt, thats what I have been reading mostly since last yr so I''m pretty sure it was a SWAT issue.\r\n\r\nto further elucidate my point and if memory serves me well, the rationale was that in a true FUBAR situation, motor skills begin to tire out very quickly, inexperienced combatants ( which most of us are) may also experience tunnel vision. Under such duress, actaully aligning ur front and rear sights to the target gets a little more tedious than compared to range firing a cardboard target. Therefore, aiming lower than centre mass will ensure hits on the centre mass. (providing u have reasonable trigger time, u will not yank the trigger, rendering ur projectile to hit towards the lower left of centre mass).\r\n\r\nAgain this is true for a CV who will not encounter combat on a regular basis, Military and LEA definately train for centre mass as they progress in training and frequency of encounter with hostiles. \r\n\r\nthe Israeli point shooting system in which NO SIGHTS are used also advocates pointing the gun slightly lower than centre mass. Actually the ISRAELI POINT SHOOT is quite interesting, I will post this on the forum for other brothers. \r\n\r\nregards, tyr', ''),

Should I look for HK sights and modify for fitting?\r\n\r\nWikipedia read "Aperture sights, also known as peep sights, range from the ghost ring sight, whose thin ring blurs to near invisibility (hence ghost), to target aperture sights that use large disks or other occluders with pinhole-sized apertures. In general, the thicker the ring, the more precise the sight, and the thinner the ring, the faster the sight. The image to the right shows a shooter''s eye view of the sight picture taken through large and small diameter apertures. The large diameter aperture provides a much brighter image of the target, and the ghosting of the rear ring is evident. The smaller aperture, while providing a much darker image of the target, provides a much greater depth of field (see pinhole camera for an explanation of this effect), yielding a much sharper image of the target.[1] The theory of operation behind the aperture sight is that the human eye will automatically center the front sight when looked through the rear aperture, thus ensuring accuracy.\r\n\r\nThese sights are used on target rifles of several disciplines and on several military rifles such as the M1 Garand, the No. 4 series Enfields and the M16 series of weapons along with several others. Peep sights are very effective in poor lighting, and have found favor with a few hunters who hunt in heavy cover".', ''),

OBSERVE THE BELOW PIC WATER SEEMS CALM AND ITS NOT DEEP IN FACT AS YOU CAN SEE THE GROUND TOO, BUT CHECK THE WATER FLOW OVER MY LEGS THAT IS WHY DECOYS ARE NOT PRESENT ON THIS SIDE, and its river Jhelum Brother. Do observe the decoys spread side, water is level is high but water flow is not there and remember the hide is on tapu/ berrataa. \n5) Where water level is low, and i can retrieve the ducks easily upto a certain distance. \n6) Offcourse, little away from population.\n7) Where i can carry my hunting luggage very easily (the distance beyond the reach of my vehicle) \n8) Where there are some attractive tapus / beratas are present.\n9) I will make my hide on the flat side of river rather water flow side.\n10) Remember i always walk around my point upto a certain distance with a fellow hunter and long stick along with, to measure the creditability of new point.     \n\n\nI might be missing alot of others, which may my fellows like Prince, TR, Dr saab and other hunters will cover.', ''),

(357167, 'Israeli Combat Point Shooting (ICPS) I''ve written this article myself with some references of course, hopefully it will serve as a good preamble to those who haven''t heard of it. google is your friend if u need to learn more. This is my first attempt to write an article so please don''t kill me if there are mistakes.  :D regards, tyr. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Israeli Combat Point Shooting training, or ICPS is not to develop \r\nmarksmanship and it is not to punch holes in paper targets.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the training is to enable one to quickly and effectively stop someone who \r\nis trying to make you a victim. \r\n\r\nIn short, instinctive/Combat Point shooting trains people to win in a life threatening \r\nsituations when you need to react in a fraction of a second in order to defend your life or \r\nprotect other innocent people, often referred as a self defense discipline. \r\n\r\nThis self defense system was developed in Israel - a country that is constantly \r\nexperiencing and facing the violence of terrorist nature. It became the most tested system \r\nwhen it comes to armed self defense.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the innocent citizen or cop must wait until a terrorist acts; one cannot shoot another on mere suspicion. This places the citizen in a situation where he must react to another’s actions. In a gunfight the aggressor has the advantage and the defender is usually a second or two behind. Thus the citizen/defender/victim is already coming second in the contest; and there are no second place winners! \r\n\r\nIn order to win, given this terrible disadvantage, the citizen must be able to overcome this \r\nlag time with a combination of speed and accuracy. This is what the ICPS teaches: speed and \r\naccuracy in an armed encounter. Instinctive/Point shooting trains you to win in a gunfight, \r\neven when the aggressor has the advantage. There are no rules in a gunfight/knife fight and street fight that puts you in a fraction second survival chance. \r\n\r\nThere are only facts, which if understood, can give you a winning edge: \r\n\r\nFact: Almost all gunfights occur at distances of under three meters. \r\n\r\nFact: Most gunfights are over in two to three seconds. \r\n\r\nFact: A high percentage of gunfights occur in dim light or where sights are \r\nhardly visible. \r\n\r\nFact: In a spontaneous life-threatening situation tthe body undergoes changes which \r\ndeteriorate fine motor skills, while vision is focused exclusively on the threat. \r\n\r\nConclusion: To win in a gunfight, or surviving a life threatening situation assault, \r\nrequires great speed and accuracy in drawing and firing the gun at close range without \r\nthe use of sights. This is sometimes called instinctive shooting or point shooting.  \r\n\r\nAttacks are sudden and without warning. A huge bonus during such attack is a concealed \r\nhandgun capable of immediate action, one that requires no time-wasting two-handed \r\nloading operation or a frantic search for a cunningly hidden safety catch. What is needed \r\nis a handgun that can be pulled, pointed and fired repeatedly without a fuss or bother, as \r\nwell as capable of being carried safely whilst in this ready mode. \r\n\r\nSo how does the ICPS work?  Read on...\r\n\r\nWhen you hold your pistol ready to fire, you usually use your index finger (shahadat finger in Muslim lingo :) ). You take aim and start firing. In the ICPS, you hold your index finger alongside the slide, and use your middle finger to pull the trigger. While this may sound awkward, with a little practice, it gets comfortable. The action of the slide while firing, can injure your finger so care must be taken to place your index finger out of the path of the slide action. This MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE with some handguns due to their design. This technique is best done with the 1911 pistol (another reason testifying for its immaculate design ;) ).\r\n\r\nThe shooter does not use the pistols sights to engage with the threat, he will simply point his index finger at the target, randomly and start firing with his middle finger. While doing so, the barrel of the pistol will automatically align itself with the index finger which is placed parallel to the slide/barrel, thus sending projectiles to 90% accuracy of the intended area. \r\n\r\nThis method was devised keeping in light that ever since we are babies, we POINT at objects WITH OUR INDEX FINGERS.It is imbedded in our instincts. In a stressful situation, we also tend to point at stuff when we can''t seem to remember names of objects and people. Now only if you can teach yourself to pull the trigger from the middle finger, BINGO you got a quite a quick, effective system to counter threats without the use of your weapon sights.\r\n\r\nThe debate whether what is better is for ameteurs, learn them both, and practice till perfect. You may need one or both one day, after all a martial arts experts does not question the efficacy of punches over kicks or vice versa, he masters both.', ''),

Why not spend few minutes and get o know it. Worldwide more people know the 22LR than any other caliber. Worldwide more 22LR cartridges are sold than all other calibers combined. Why such popularity? Read a bit more and find out.\n \nThe popularity stems from the fact that this is the cheapest brass carteridge available. For a given amount of money, you shoot or plink more than other brass cartridge ammunition. It is an ideal caliber for starting out in the shooting hobby. There is hardly any recoil. Larger calibers scare away many people because of their heavy recoil. Some flinch when shooting larger caliber guns - this due to the expected kick in the shoulder when pulling the trigger.\n \nThe 22LR is a small cartridge. But, it packs power - power that needs to be respected. Many people use air rifles to kill game animals like rabbits at short distances. The 22LR has the same amount of killing power at distances in exces of 800 yeards that an air rifle delivers in front of the barrel. With high velocity 22LR ammunition, many shoot targets beyond 150 yards.\n \nIf you have larger caliber rifles or handguns and don''t have any 22LR, why not assess your situation in this life. How often you use that big bore? Not often? Here is a polite suggestion - get a 22LR. You will get attached to it more than the other guns you have. If the budget is tight, unload (meaning sell) one of your bigger bore guns and spend the money on 22LR. With the leftover money you can buy lot of 22LR ammunition. \n \nLife is too short - get a 22LR and have some fun.', ''),

(357384, ' [QUOTE=Starfish;195981]Anytime sir. It would be a pleasure. lets plan something.[/QUOTE]\n \nWe are meeting tomorrow so we will discuss the sight pictures. I am busy this evening else would have invited you n your buddy over.\nThe word ''Bull'' is used in a different context when we apply it to target shooting. \nThe word bulls eye means a 10, but in the context of aiming it is the whole BLACK ROUNDAL. When one is aiming CORRECTLY one''s eye is FOCUSSED on the FRONT SIGHT. This throws all the markings , rings and numbers on the target completely out of focus and invisible at ranges of 10 yards or more.\nOne puts his in focus, sharply defined front sight into the centre of the fuzzy out of focus black roundal or bull for a cetre hold,\nor places the front sight under the big black roundal just touching it at six ''O'' clock ( not recommended for pistol shooting as ones hand keeps slightly moving and the stress of un necessarily aligning the sight with the six ''O'' clock results in a snatch of the trigger rather than getting a surprise break ) or at sub six. \nThe sub six hold is at an imaginery blank space well below the black roundal or bull. Like you said earlier it is extremely RANGE and TARGET SIZE specific and strictly for given match conditions where every thing is fixed, is the BEST AIMING method.\n \nThe mechanics I will try to explain.\nThe sight relationship between the two sights ( Back sight and Front is of paramount importance, not the position of the sights on the aiming point, this is so because even when the sights are a quarter inch off center, one percieves that the sights are completely off as the Target appears to be just a few minutes of angle .\nThe slightest error in sights alignment with the bull appears as a major error; which is not true but ones brain does not agree and snatches the trigger on the moving hand trying to release the shot when the sight is briefly passing the center point ; this throws the shot completely off target.\nIf we just concentrate on getting a surprise break or release of the shot while the well aligned sights are any where in the aiming AREA the result will be a hit in the 10 or X ring. The reason is that the slightest error in alignment with the aiming area is not percieved as magnified and a relaxed trigger control leads to a SURPRISE BREAKING of the shot.\nI hope I have been able to explain this area aiming / sub six aiming technique correctly.\nI must hasten to add you have to harmonise or zero your pistol to shoot several inches above point of aim and a weapon zeroed in this method is only good for Target shooting at a specific given range and Target size. At all other ranges and target sizes the gun will have to be rezeroed.\nAdvanced Match shooters already know what I am talking about, but it will cause some difficulty in comprehending this technique for our brothers not in match shooting. For Deliberate , Precision Matches the Area Aiming Sub Six is the best and almost 90 % or more shooters use it.\nFor general all around shooting ,Rapid Fire, and reflex shooting, hunting and SD . The Centre Mass aiming is the best with no other possibility.\nNow we will have a lengthy question and answer session as I have provided enough gun powder or matter to mull on when we meet next. \nTIGHT GROUPS', ''),

Though such opportunities for shikar will never come again, I am glad to know about others who follow his path. I also hope that his message of conservation is understood by all who are associated with this sport. The key to all such activity is SUSTAINABLE HUNTING.  If are hunting remains within limits it will remain sustainable.\r\nJim Corbetts Biographies have been written by many authors. One of them is Jerry Jaleel who has been associated with Jim in childhood and the book he wrote is &#8216;&#8217;Under the Shadow of Man Eaters&#8217;&#8217;. I have a copy. Jerry has moved to Canada and is founder of Jim Corbett Foundation there. He has collected trophies and Photographs and other information about Jim to be shared with others through a museum in Canada.\r\nNext interesting part in this discussion is about Khan Sahib Jamshed Butt. I also admire his courage and his hunting. I have a copy of the book written by him since 1972. Title of the book is Shikar. It is his biography and details of his shootings. It has a number of photographs as well. His name is also mentioned in another book on shikar written by foreign hunters visiting India for Shikar.

Than i used for hunting but very disappointing it was throwing  pellets  way off to left some time up side to target some times down than i was very sad ......... After searching reviews and going contact with (Airgunweb.com) they  solved my problem they says your gun is accurate only problem is with you they guide me well First to give a gun lubrication than set a Rear sight which is adjustable giving a tiny nobs to anticlockwise to move pellets up and clockwise to move down and send me a clip which is on you tube   [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZbF5U2cmI0[/url]   take a full view than my gun was properly adjustable due to powerful speed feet per second low weight pellets less than 13 grams are not accurate use heavy pellets weight more than 15 grams to get 100% result than i practice a lot almost 150 pellets used only for   practice than i find 100% result  with crosman premiers and bee-man Kodiak very good pellets only available in USA Gamo pro-magnum was also pretty accurate i started hunting without scope and was very happy putting down soooo many doves couple of rabbits and one dog now very enjoying with it ...i again says give time to air guns do practice   for 100% result  Diana 350 magnum is dam good for me[/QUOTE]\n \nGood share, I just wanted to let you know that the inaccuracy you were experiencing was due to the reason the the rifle had not been broken in yet. When ever you buy a brand new springer the first couple of hundred pellets are not going to be accurate, the reason behind it is that the mechanism in the gun is still new and is not in harmony with all the mechanical parts, The second reason for this in accuracy is the rifling in the barrel and the crown of the barrel as they are still new and keep changing as pellets go through the bore of the gun, once a couple hundred pellets have gone through the bore the rifling and the crown of the gun will have some wear on it and thus make it more accurate. One more reason why air rifles are inaccurate at times is a because air rifles are very hold sensitive and as you change your non firing hand position there will be minute changes in the accuracy and yes pellets do contribute to this inaccuracy problem, I would advise you to buy a couple of tins of different brand of pellets that are easily available and shoot at a paper target at 50m in a rested position that way you can see what pellet suits your rifle the most. I say this because one brand might suit your guns rifling then the other and the rifling for each gun is different so people saying this pellet is the best in a 350mag might say it because it does better in their barrel.', ''),

(357561, ' My Daer all. If we have not A good number of area setled ducks in Game reserves, sancturies, barrages, lakes, and dams in Punjab. Then less number of ducks will move on water streams, or river open areas. so you cannot shoot or enjoy a good number of ducks. So you will see  agood number of ducks only on there migration. From last couple of years  ducks come to our area in early migration with a good number than they shift to Sindh. because there are still a good number of feeding areas . In my opinion only 5 to 10 % of total migration stay in Punjab During Duck season. Now come to Wild life management. All ducks scanturies, Game reserves or any other special resting point for these ducks where they can rest during day time. Fishries Department punjab Issued Contract for catching fish to peoples. When Ducks season is on full swing the fish season is also on peak. The Fish contractors fisherman boats all day busy in there netting. So they disturb Ducks badly whole day. With this also mainly these fisherman are from Sindh they also involved netting for duck also. I have seen many time this act at Rasul Barrage.and Qadra abad barrage.\r\nSo durring season after migration here in safe area we have no enough ducks.\r\nI think We can only pray To Allha to send more ducks this year , otherwise my expections are not so high this year on river sopts.

I hope and wish same for  Siberian  ducks too.\r\n\r\nDuck Numbers Remain Strong\r\nPond Counts Approach Record Levels\r\n\r\nExcellent wetland conditions have set the stage for above-average waterfowl production\r\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. - June 30, 2011 - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released its preliminary report today on breeding ducks and habitats, based on surveys conducted in May and early June. Total duck populations were estimated at 45.6 million breeding ducks on the surveyed area. This estimate represents an 11 percent increase over last year&#8217;s estimate of 40.9 million birds and is 35 percent above the 1955-2010 long-term average. This was only the fifth time in the survey&#8217;s history that the total duck population exceeded 40 million. \r\n&#8220;The FWS has reported nearly unprecedented waterfowl habitat conditions and breeding duck population levels for 2011&#8212;the best in several years for some areas,&#8221; said Ducks Unlimited&#8217;s Chief Scientist Dale Humburg. &#8220;Full wetlands and good upland cover will likely support a strong breeding effort, particularly in the prairies this year.&#8221;\r\nHabitat conditions across the U.S. and Canadian prairies and parklands were considered excellent. Further north, wetland conditions in most boreal regions of Alaska and northern Canada were good to very good at the time of the survey. During the survey and into early summer, many regions important to breeding ducks continued to receive significant snow melt and further precipitation, which could increase later breeding efforts and ensure brood survival. If these wet conditions continue, prospects going into the winter and possibly into spring 2012 will be favorable as well.\r\nIn addition to extensive grassland cover, one of the most important elements in duck breeding success is the amount of water present in portions of prairie and parkland Canada and the north-central United States. Total pond counts for the United States and Canada combined showed 8.1 million ponds, a 22 percent increase from last year&#8217;s estimate and 62 percent above the long-term average. This was the second time in the survey&#8217;s history that ponds exceeded 8 million.\r\n \r\nOf the 10 species traditionally reported, eight were similar to or increased in number from 2010. Two species (scaup and American wigeon) remained below their long-term average. Northern shovelers, blue-winged teal and northern pintails were bright spots on this year&#8217;s survey. Northern shovelers and bluewings reached record highs (4.6 and 8.9 million, respectively), and northern pintail numbers surpassed 4 million for the first time since 1980. Scaup numbers were similar to 2010 and remain below their long-term averages. Only three species&#8212;scaup, northern pintail and American wigeon&#8212;remain below North American Waterfowl Management Plan population goals.', ''),

(357610, 'Mil-Dot Scope Really Mil-Dot? Nowadays there is lot of interest in mil-dot rifle scopes. This interest stems from the fact that mil measurement is used in the armed forces of many nations.\r\n\r\nUsually we measure angles in degrees, minutes and seconds. A circle has 360 degrees. A degree has 60 minute. A minute has 60 seconds. Many scopes in the marketplace are the MOA type - graduated in minute (minute=1/60degree) of angle. One MOA at 100 yards is about one minute (closer to 1.047 inches).\r\n\r\nAnother way to measure angels is by radians or milliradians (1/1,000 radian). A circle has 2 pi radians. Pi is a math constant  with approximate value of 3.14159. A circle is equal to 6.2832 (2X3.14159) radians or 6,283.2 milliradians. Since this value is cumbersome in doing calculations, this number is usually rounded. Depending on the country, the rounded number is 6,00 in Russia, 6,300 in Sweden and 6,400 in NATO countries. \r\n\r\nLet us get an idea of the value of a mil in the field. One mil at a distance of 1,00 yards is one yard or 36 inches. At 100 yards a mil equates to 0.1 yard or 3.6 inches. In metric measures, one mil at a distance of 1,000 meters is one meter. At 100 meters one mil is 0.1 meter.   \r\n\r\nNow that we know what a mil is, let us turn our attention to the use of mil in rifle scopes. A mil-dot scope has reticle (cross-hair) that is calibrated/graduated in increments of mils. Depending on the make and model of the scope, the graduations may be in increments of 0.1, 0.2 or 0.5 mil. Some scopes have hash mark graduations while other have dots and still others have combinations to hash marks and dots. The markings help us estimate distances. To make elevation or windage adjustments, the appropriate turret (knob) is turned. The turrets in most cases are graduated in minutes of angle or MOA. Most mil-dots scopes are of this type. Very few mil-dot scope have turrets that are graduated in mils - in synch with reticle graduations.\r\n\r\nMany scope buyers get a surprise to find out that their mil-dot scopes have turrets calibrated in MOAs. Therein lies the confusion. Is you mil-dot scope really mil-dot?\r\n\r\nRelated Posts:\r\nApril 4, 2011 Rifle Scope Alignment Made Simple to Save Ammunition/Money\r\nApril 5, 2011 You Adjusted Your Rifle Scope/Sight at Distance for ???

I hope and wish same for  Siberian  ducks too.\r\n\r\nDuck Numbers Remain Strong\r\nPond Counts Approach Record Levels\r\n\r\nExcellent wetland conditions have set the stage for above-average waterfowl production\r\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. - June 30, 2011 - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released its preliminary report today on breeding ducks and habitats, based on surveys conducted in May and early June. Total duck populations were estimated at 45.6 million breeding ducks on the surveyed area. This estimate represents an 11 percent increase over last year&#8217;s estimate of 40.9 million birds and is 35 percent above the 1955-2010 long-term average. This was only the fifth time in the survey&#8217;s history that the total duck population exceeded 40 million. \r\n&#8220;The FWS has reported nearly unprecedented waterfowl habitat conditions and breeding duck population levels for 2011&#8212;the best in several years for some areas,&#8221; said Ducks Unlimited&#8217;s Chief Scientist Dale Humburg. &#8220;Full wetlands and good upland cover will likely support a strong breeding effort, particularly in the prairies this year.&#8221;\r\nHabitat conditions across the U.S. and Canadian prairies and parklands were considered excellent. Further north, wetland conditions in most boreal regions of Alaska and northern Canada were good to very good at the time of the survey. During the survey and into early summer, many regions important to breeding ducks continued to receive significant snow melt and further precipitation, which could increase later breeding efforts and ensure brood survival. If these wet conditions continue, prospects going into the winter and possibly into spring 2012 will be favorable as well.\r\nIn addition to extensive grassland cover, one of the most important elements in duck breeding success is the amount of water present in portions of prairie and parkland Canada and the north-central United States. Total pond counts for the United States and Canada combined showed 8.1 million ponds, a 22 percent increase from last year&#8217;s estimate and 62 percent above the long-term average. This was the second time in the survey&#8217;s history that ponds exceeded 8 million.\r\n \r\nOf the 10 species traditionally reported, eight were similar to or increased in number from 2010. Two species (scaup and American wigeon) remained below their long-term average. Northern shovelers, blue-winged teal and northern pintails were bright spots on this year&#8217;s survey. Northern shovelers and bluewings reached record highs (4.6 and 8.9 million, respectively), and northern pintail numbers surpassed 4 million for the first time since 1980. Scaup numbers were similar to 2010 and remain below their long-term averages. Only three species&#8212;scaup, northern pintail and American wigeon&#8212;remain below North American Waterfowl Management Plan population goals.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nno doubt a nice share masroor brother and after reading this i for the first time come to know that how good they r in protecting their assets and how poor v r in the same!\r\nit is always a pleasure to read  posts by a hardcore waterfowler like u!', ''),

(357649, ' Dual recoil spring of the PT 145 takes care of the recoil and brings it almost at par with the 9, not much of a difference as such, yet with multiple or quick follow up shots, handling does require bit of practice. I personally have not practised much, if at all, yet can still place 4-5 quick shots within the spheres of a PG target chart, though getting them within black area will require, however, some serious sessions and maybe some 500 rounds as well for required minimum proficency level. With the 9, same may be attained in perhaps 300 rounds, or lesser, serious practice, so it''s basically about what you settle yourself for and can comfortably afford with respect to difference in ammo prices. May, I add, apart from looks, these guns have nothing in common on the functional basis. PT 145 is a reliable fellow and I''ve had the  positive experience with two of them. Within the 9, I''d suggest something else, depending on your budget, your requirement of deep concealment is clear to me, hence new Makarov MP 442  by Baikal in 9x18 within budget guns (55K), CZ Rami within mid range (120K), S/W M&P SC of high enders (250K).

Yeah I want to see what the gun is capable of so if a boar attacks my property or anything I can neutralize the threat, and I don''t consider any rule favorable. Nothing wrong, I guess?? :)\n4. Sorry for mistaking your age. :D\n5. Common sense is that you round off 535 to 500 or 550 so sorry, my mistake and I know it was 535 fps. And most people prefer buying the newer and better model than the 35, the model 34 and that is claimed to be around 800 fps, although it''s ,much less. 800fps for model 35, so why would people buy 54 airking or 350 magnum which are heavy boulders just for the sake of 100 fps? You know the claimed fps of 350mag in .22 is 1150 (but it goes nowhere near).\n6. lols. ;)  I agreed because you can shoot a single boar with a shotgun which is roaming around (not in a flock).. And you can''t object to me agreeing as you know 90% of our hunters use shotguns for boar hunting and with (SG or aometimes LG cartridges instead of slugs). so yeah there is no harm in using slugs for boars.

My wife says Don’t fall in luv too deeply….. or else.    I hunker down (learnt that in 19 yrs married life)…but she can’t peep into my heart, can she?.            My 4yr son wants to lay hands on this new toy ….I had to bribe him with a light emitting noisy contraption…..

But on the range I am the Boss and I own it.\r\n\r\nA year or so back I was comparing some 9MMs for buying off the market, including NP-22, CF-98 and Cougar Stoeger 8000. While on the range I got opportunity to fire a few mags off someone’s duty G-19 (dunno which model). I was really impressed on my first attempt and that too rapid fire at 25M. Comparatively my two bit intro feeling about these weapons was; NP-22: Good but bit wayward (later shot a lot and got used to it quite well), Stoeger: excellent/good balance and weighty (I liked the feel), CF-98: I’ve had better (LOL)….. Requires getting used to, stiff when new, awkward safety...... but excellent Bang 4 the Buck. \r\n\r\nEventually I got a duty NP-22 and kept yearning for the G-19. A year and a half’s research followed with countless hours on Pakguns, going through numerous foreign gun reviews and comparisons and finally....... I homed on this gun. Mighty real effort and running around of six months …. getting the correct paper work and the permits, visit to the land of Glocks on the other side of the world and a lot of coordination later…… Yippee……I am the proud owner of a GLOCK 19 Gen 4.', ''),

As in case of Btair, deer, frog, crocodile, ostrich and Boar around the world where its meat is available in market. and ppl who want to hunt as gentlemen donot hunt females young or especially do not exceed bag limit. neither they use automatic weapons.\\\n@husain syed i am saying true hunters of Pakistan should come forward or other wise their wouldn''t be any game left for their OWN children\n@virk first of all by not hunting excessively, bringing awareness among our fellow hunters and peers (not succumbing to peer pressure regarding exceeding bad limit). Not to feel PROUD by hunting without permit from wildlife because its breaking law and its some thing to be ashamed not to be proud of, if some one is really rich powerful & influential should show by obtaining a license to hunt and paying full fee. and last rule\n\n"NEVER PRAISE A TROPHY OR A HUNTER WHO HAS POACHED OR EXCEEDED BAG LIMIT EVEN IF ITS BEST IN THE WORLD OR EVEN BELONGS TO YOUR OWN"\nnote:learn from hunters such as Jim Corbett, not some local poachers who hunt to sell meat and skin in big cities or to show their power to break law.', ''),

Ammo price wont be an issue InshAllah. Well apart from from 9mm or .45, these guns are [B]highly concealable[/B] with decent ammo capacity and tritium night sights.

But if 145 has no match for CZ-Rami (being RAMI the CC weapon) then perhaps i will buy just Rami and wait for Makarov. \r\n \r\nregards[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nLolz! Thanks for the credits, you''re welcome, my pleasure for sure, since I''m coincidentally a happy owner of both Cc''s you''re asking for above. I''ve posted a full comparison review of these two guns, you may find it in my threads, can''t paste the link here from mobile Gprs, so search a bit for yourself. This is a perfect CC duo in either caliber and both are accurate guns for SD distance use, i.e, 10-15 mtrs, which is double than enough, but Rami is inherently the better with accuracy, being a 9mm and that too from CZ. It beats longer barrelled 9''s as well and recoil is course lower, yet I personally have never managed gauging recoil somehow and use to laugh on this whenever I discuss with Denovo Sir, who too is  immune to gauging this factor, since we believe a gun is supposed to do it''s "jerk" and let out it''s feelings, lolz! I''d feel a difference in operating a .50 perhaps, but not between 2 of 9''s. So I''d say, if present budget allows, take a Rami, unless like me, you''re a fan of .45. Or best of all, give in and succumb to a gunner''s "greed" and take both, one by one, lolz! Regards.', ''),

(358004, ' the scope is often not that simple to zero, as simple u see in this youtube video, because of a couple of factors, which , I,ll discuss below.\n \n1.[COLOR=red][U][B]scope internal and external body alignment[/B][/U][/COLOR] : most of the times our scope is not aligned to itself,(parallax to body)and when we mount it on the rifle, we have a tilted scope from the start. To minimize or compensate for this, put your scope on a stand, so that it is trully horizontal, and then watch through it. the cross hair must be pointing at some sharp aiming point. now slowly rotate the scope on the stand, clockwise , without disturbing the horizontality and keep watching at the aiming point. if the cross hair shifts, your scope is not truelly aligned to itself.\n \nIdeally the scope should be zeroed by minimum possible number of elevation and deflection clicks. the reason is that the clicks incorporate additional tension of the springs holding the scope inside the scope body.these springs when unduly tense, gradually loose their holding accuracy. the best position with common scopes is the natural centre of clicks, as if u never used the knobs. \nThe only exception is when u have a very good and genuine scope, whose springs are not prone to tension degeneration, u may always zero the scope with the knobs provided. but such scopes are very rare (none below Rs.10,000/-)and it is best to remove the deviation by manual methods , such as using a thin metal foil on the mount , between the rifle and the clamps, for elevation. Personally I used cigarette foil for elevation correction. You would always note that whenever u first put a scope to ur rifle and shoot, the aim tends to be lower that is the rifle shoots below the aiming point. this is because of a phenomena known as "barrel droop".\nfor deflection or windage, if you see the shot displaced by over one inch, there is a serious issue of alignment and clamping of the scope. better eliminate that first, rather than playing around with the windage knob. Ideally windage knob should not be given more than four clicks, any side.\n \n \n[COLOR=red][U][B]2. Scope hold on the rifle[/B][/U][/COLOR] : the second most important factor is the scope hold, that is how firmly the scope is clamped to the rifle. I tell you, with most of the dianas , just forget about shooting accurately, if you dont have a single piece mount.most of the time the scope travels on the scope rail, with every shot.....some say that a stopper would eliminate this. I disagree. the stopper just fails after a few shots. best is to go for a single piece mount and see the difference it brings to your accuracy. \n \nwhen you have done this, go to the shooting area, make a good firing position with sand bags or sand filled socks or anything which gives you a soft, jerk and flinch free hold.let the scope,s focus be adjusted to give you a very clear view of the target. aim carefully, as accurately as possible and keep shooting. dont notice every shot result. just fire five shots and see if u have shot close enough to make a one inch or smaller group at 20 yards. If u cant do that , there is something wrong with your aim, so fix that before attempting other things.\n \nto conclude, I must say that people who think they can zero their scopes for elevation difference of over 4 inches only with knobs are living in fools paradise.', ''),

While they may be good to look at, all praise to our pakhtun bretheren and their craftsmenship, but they just don''t possess the tech and know how to produce world class weapons.

I think its coherent here:\n\nTwo things in life should be very dependable, you should be able to trust these things with your life.

However, if you know the essential tweaks, a 1911 can be the most accurate gun on earth.\n\nAlso, pt-1911s are for less than 600 dollars in the US, which translates into something around 60 grands in PKR.\n\nRegards,\nCD.', ''),

And if you have "requested" similar "gifts" from them previously, have you promised cash and then actually given her cash too?? :))\nJust wondering thats all. I am sure you are like this but....I do have a few relatives and friends who ask me to bring something (expensive) for them which is out of my pocket to give to a relative as a gift (out of many gifts i have to bring when I visit Pakistan) and they say they will pay for it, but when I get there with the item after making good effort to get it, pack, and bring it with me and bribe the customs etc, they either dont pay for it, or say that it is simply too expensive ...haha....but ofcourse they are relatives at the end, so I cant really ask for the money :) ...but on the other hand if i was to choose a gift to give them out my own accord, I would have ofcourse chosen something nice, something I would have liked them to have, and more importantly something I could easily and happily afford without putting a significant strain on my pocket :)\nOfcourse hopefully not every one has this kind of "special" relatives....I may just be one of the few "lucky" ones :)\n\nAlso it is really not every one''s cup of tea to carry an airgun etc through the UK airports and then through Pakistani customs. The media here does make you feel like a terrorist by just having a beard let alone having an air rifle (which is classified as a weapon) in your possession, in your bags or in your house....I think it is very likely that even a neighbour may call the police when they see a brown skinned Pakistani guy with beard and wearing shalwar qameez standing in the back garden or inside his house, with a pretty serious looking air rifle in his hands like an S16s !!!   so all in all they cant be really blamed for trying not to buy one for you :)', ''),

Ofcourse rabbits only and no hares. I ususally hunt with air rifle and have a SGC too but FAC was harder to get cos the land I had permission on wasnt big enough :(\nI''m in Denmark these days for a few months. Hunting here is taken pretty seriously. No limits on the airgun power, but to hunt anything, you need a .22 min bore, and a hunting license. As far as I know the hunting license is required even for woodys and rabbits too (seems like there is a season for them too) which is very different from the UK where I can hunt them all year around without any hunting license so long as I have the permission from the land owner (probably same down your end too).', ''),

They are legal in the UK ofcourse. I posted a thread recently after buying and bring over two PCPs to Pakistan from the UK. The thread is [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?6278-My-new-purchase-Logun-S16S-and-GunPower-Storm-%28AirForce-Talon%29-Full-PCP-setup"]HERE[/URL]\n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?6278-My-new-purchase-Logun-S16S-and-GunPower-Storm-%28AirForce-Talon%29-Full-PCP-setup[/url]\n\nThey are all legal but if the power is above 12ft lb, then you need a license to have them/buy them. I have always hunted rabbits with 12ft lb and sometimes at quite far distances. So your cousin can buy them legally and bring them over. I dont think it would be wise to post/ship one but bringing one with you shouldnt be a problem. But it is true to an extent that the UK is hyper sensitive to air guns, where as in Pakistan and many other countries around the globe, they are not even considered a "weapon" at all, and you can walk around almost anywhere with one. So your cousin is quite right to feel this way, however in reality there is nothing illegal about just going out and purchasing an air rifle of any kind as long as its sub 12 ft lb.\n\nIf your cousin needs any help in buying one, you can pm me their email address, and I can explain to them if they dont know how to go about it.\n\nHope that helps.\nGB', ''),

(358344, 'One More Type Rifle scope is an ideal tool for shooters. Beside the advantage of target magnification, it can also be used to measure distance with rifles of all types - from 22LR to big magnums.\n \nScopes are available with various types of reticels (cross-hair). The mil-dot and the 30/30 (also called the plex style) are the most common in use. The mil-dot requires some calculations that may be difficult to do mentally in the field. The 30/30 requires judging relative size of the target in relation to the fine-portion of the reticle for measuring distances. \n \nThere is a scope reticle style that is not as "cluttered" as the mil-dot and not as "empty" as the 30/30. This type, the MOA style has a standard reticle with vertical and horizontal hash marks that equate to either one inch/1MOA (minute of angle) or two inches/2 MOA at 100 yards. The turrets (knobs) are usually adjustable in increments of 1/4 MOA - 1/4" at 100 yards. Some turrets have even finer adjustments. To measure distance you simply sight the target - say head of a rabbit of about 3 inches. You count the number of hash marks that cover the head. Let us say three hash marks cover the rabbit''s head. If the scope reticle is calibrated at 1 MOA intervals, then the three hash marks equate to a distance of 100 yards. The the count were 1.5 hash marks, the rabbit would be at a distance of 200 yards. If the hash mark count was 6, the rabbit would be 50 yards away.\n \nThe type of scope described is hard to locate as only a few scope manufacturers offer them. They range in price from the high end to the very high end.\n \nRelated Posts:\nApril 4, 2011 Rifle Scope Alignment Made Simple to Save Ammunition/Money\nApril 5, 2011 You Adjusted You Rifle Scope/Sight at Distance of ???

(358403, ' @HUNTER 1,..I never experienced or heard about Duck shoot at dry land in Pakistan. But I think there are many advantages of Duck Shoot at dry land for example \r\n·	No risk of water or deep water, no need of boat.\r\n·	No fear of Cold Weather, don''t need wader.\r\n·	Whole village or big party can sit in shooting position.\r\n·	Shooting pressure can be minimizing at rivers and big waters.\r\n·	Learner and trainer both will be at risk free atmosphere.\r\n·	You can also save cartridges by using seeds trapping, just mount few fruit baskets and rope.

How ever, the move proved to be mere eye wash as the display of arms by people and private security guards is still continuing and very much common in city.\n\n\nknow the question arises as follows:-\n1. What type of weapons? Fire arms only or even daggers and swords??\n2. Only display of illegal arms is ban? What about keeping it??\n3. What does display exactly mean?\n4. Does it cover MOI, as section 144 is issued by provincial authority and they have no legality over MOI?\n5. if we keep our weapon concealed does it classify as exhibition?\n6.

(358441, '22LR - Improving Rifle Accuracy Do you want to improve the accuracy of your 22LR rifle? We all do. Here are some techniques to try to improve your odds.\r\n\r\nFirst check the condition of the crown, the front end of the barrel from where the bullet departs into the air. The rifling (groves and lands) of the barrel at the crown need to be crisp and smooth so the gases behind the bullet have pressure distributed evenly as the bullet leave the front end of the barrel. The condition of the crown can be examined under a magnifying glass. The crown may be worm due to age and usage. But, very likely it may be damaged by improper bore cleaning technique. Improper finishing of the crown could be also be a factory manufacturing defect. \r\n\r\nI have refinished 22LR and .308 rifle crowns with some hand tools - a rotary cutting blade (used to trim brass cartridge case lengths) and a brass pilot to keep the cutter centered in the bore. If you are too timid for this task, take the rifle to a qualified gunsmith. Make sure you examine his finished work under a magnifying glass to verify that it was done correctly. \r\n\r\nBecause of the uniqueness of the 22LR caliber, it is sensitive to the type of ammunition used. With the same ammunition, two riles of the same make and model may not deliver the same results on the target.  For this reason it become essential to try out various makes and types of ammo - as many as you can get your hands one to determine which one gives you the best results. It is likely that a make or type of ammo you currently do not use may give you better accuracy. The only way to find out is to go out and seek other makes and types of of ammo. You can buy the makes and types you don''t have currently or exchange your ammo with your friends.', ''),

(358511, 'FANTASY &amp; WEAPONRY By Kurt Saxon, A very informative article I was reading survival weapons writeups when came across this article. Very informatve in nature and sheds lights why PB Auto weapons are useless for defense and shuld be avoided.\r\n\r\n"A pistol for the bedroom,\r\nA shotgun over the door,\r\nA 30-06 for reaching out;\r\nYou don''t need any more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf an intruder makes it to your bedroom, shoot him with the pistol. If he''s trying to break in, use the shotgun. If he is fifty yards or more away and shooting at you, pick him off with the 30-06.\r\n\r\nThis is the real Survivalist''s arsenal; basic, inexpensive, effective. So why all the promotion of rapid-fire weapons? If you aim at a man and don''t hit him, he'' going to move, and probably shoot you. Banging away in the same general direction is just a senseless waste of ammo. You need practice, not rapid-fire. You also need a realistic attitude, not a fantasy.\r\n\r\nBut fantasy sells. There is big money in Macho. The more awesome your weapon looks and sounds, the tougher and sexier you look. Girls get off on rapid-fire. It''s the Freudian part of the package.\r\n\r\nThe Rambo Survivalist image being sold to neurotics is making weapons dealers rich. It is also showing the profound ignorance of weapons among the general public.\r\n\r\nTo know guns, you must understand the three basic methods of shooting; sweeping, pointing and aiming.\r\n\r\nSweeping is with rapid-fire. Its main purpose is to dispatch several enemies before one can shoot you. Such confrontations are unlikely in any actual civil conflict. Raiders don''t bunch up. There would be no point to it. Of course, if you are the raider you would have a better chance wiping out a couple and two or three children if you have a rapid fire weapon.\r\n\r\nSweeping is also anticipated in cases of moving targets. Proficiency with the shotgun will do more damage to the moving target than expert use of rapid-fire.\r\n\r\nThere is a psychological disadvantage to dependency on a rapid-fire weapon. One tends to sweep or just bang away ineffectually. It is the nature of the weapon and a case of the weapon controlling the man.\r\n\r\nAn example is a commercial for a TV crime story. One of the heroes bursts into the room and says, "I just had an Uzi emptied on me outside". Obviously, the character with the Uzi swept, did not aim or even point. At least 20 shots and nothing. Of course, it was fiction. But that kind of shooting is becoming acceptable.\r\n\r\nIf an automatic weapon is shifted one and a half feet, in 20 or more yards, the bullets are spaced several feet apart. You could empty a clip on several people and not hit one. The nut who unloaded several clips of an AK-47 at a crowd of 35 children in Stockton only killed five. What if he had had a rifle and had to aim? What if he had had a shotgun and had to point? Couldn''t he see his sweeps were ineffective?\r\n\r\nHe was crazy but he wasn''t blind! He knew how to operate the weapon. But he was psyched up with the glamour image of that weapon. He was not controlling that weapon; it was controlling him.\r\n\r\nAnother TV segment was on the Gulf. Here were all these troops practicing, banging away at a dune, fully automatic, as usual. I only hope the Iraqis are on full-auto. I wouldn''t want anyone to get hurt.\r\n\r\nYet another segment was at a California shooting range. It told how the state had 300,000 assault weapons owners but only 15,000 had registered as ordered.\r\n\r\nThere were about ten men banging away on semi-auto, as fast as they could shoot. They were all pointing, as they were shooting too fast to correct aim.\r\n\r\nI suppose they were all wealthy, as ammo costs a lot. Whatever practicality there might be in such weapons, only the wealthy can afford them.\r\n\r\nWatching those men, I could see that their practice was ineffective. The targets were only 10 to 15 yards away. No proficiency can be gained by simply banging away at a stationary target from a distance at which one only has to point.\r\n\r\nWatching them reminded me of the reason for the arming of all the American forces with rapid-fire weapons. During the Korean War it was found that only one in nineteen soldiers would fire his rifle. They were mostly uniformed civilians in a no-win war and didn''t want to get killed. So they would just hunker down and try to ignore the Chinese. Having Garands, which demanded aiming, put them at risk of getting a bullet in the face.\r\n\r\nSo by the time the Vietnam fiasco rolled around the boys all had the confidence-giving, noise-making M-16s. They were effective enough for jungle fighting where one could not aim anyway, even if he knew how to shoot. It didn''t matter, however, since the other side had AK-47s; just as worthless. Of course, there were plenty enough bombs and napalm to keep the VC''s numbers manageable and most U.S. losses were due to booby-traps. So a rifleman was about as useful as nipples on a boar.\r\n\r\nI know it is hard to believe that glamor weapons with all their sound and fury, are more hype than effect. However, if one of their proud owners has it out with any practiced hunter with any rifle, the hunter will win.\r\n\r\nNow we come to pointing. Apart from shooting at flying ducks, the shotgun is mainly for pointing. Man-killing shot is from #4 to 00 buckshot. (Single 0 buckshot has 12 .30 caliber pellets per round). The best killing range is up to 50 yards.\r\n\r\nThe 12 gauge shotgun is the most devastating hand-held weapon. Few people realize how really terrible the shotgun is. The Geneva Convention bans its use in war but police use it. It was also preferred in Vietnam over regulation arms, even though a soldier''s family had to send it to him.\r\n\r\nA buckshot pellet does not have the penetrative force of any bullet of equal diameter because it is round and not as heavy as the longer bullet. Buckshot is also fired at lower velocities than bullets.\r\n\r\nBut they still inflict wounds of maximum size, induce considerable shock and hemorrhage. Also, when two or more pellets hit, their total effect on the victim is as the square of the number of hits, not just an additive progression; that is, two hits equal four times the effect of one hit, three hits equal nine times that effect, and so on. If the victim is hit by three Single 0 buckshot pellets it is the same as if he had been hit by nine .30 caliber Carbine rounds.\r\n\r\nFor the combat shotgun, it is best to take a hacksaw and cut the barrel down to the legal 18 inches. This gives it a slightly wider shot pattern and makes it a little more maneuverable.\r\n\r\nRapid-fire, semi-auto from an assault weapon has no greater killing range than does the shotgun. And since the shotgun must be pointed, and the shot pattern is wider, multiple hits per target are surer than with any assault weapon.\r\n\r\nNext in pointing, is the pistol. Beyond a few feet you want a shotgun or a rifle. Aiming a pistol is possible, but only with practice. Practice, however, has made some pistol shooters as deadly at long range as shot gunners or riflemen.\r\n\r\nThe American Rifleman article, "Debunking The Debunkers", reprinted in US MILITIA Issue 1, tells what can be done with a pistol. Read it. For the most part, the pistol is for close quarters.\r\n\r\nYou ought to own a pistol and it should be a .38 Police Special with a six inch barrel. I recommend a revolver over an automatic, since the revolver has fewer parts to malfunction. And if you don''t think the .38 has stopping power, you just don''t realize what you can do when you practice. You may have been fantasizing over glory guns, the most popular of which is the .45 automatic. Read the aforementioned article.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I was in a Los Angeles gun shop. A plain-clothes officer was at the counter talking to the dealer. The dealer stepped back into an alcove and reached up to a shelf. A shot rang out. The gun the dealer had reached for had fallen butt-first and discharged. Before the sound registered with me the officer had his pistol drawn. Naturally, there was no threat. His action was pure reflex. That cop was fast!\r\n\r\nIn the same time period, there was a funeral for a police officer fallen in the line of duty. The media covered the funeral and some dummy exploded a bomb outside the funeral home as the attending officers were assembling. The newspaper featured the frame of the newsreel of the explosion. In it was an officer with his revolver half-way drawn out of his holster! Both the accidental discharge and the explosion caught on film showed the reflexes of these men to be a tiny fraction of a second each. So you can believe the examples of speed in the article.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you practice and so become as proficient as those two officers, both in speed and instinct aiming, you can be sure of a fatal hit before your opponent can even touch his own weapon.\r\n\r\nFor the .38 revolver, I recommend the six inch barrel over the two or four inch. This is because of the barrel''s rifling. The rifling gives the bullet its spin, which keeps it on course. The longer the barrel, the more the rifling and hence the more spin. The more spin, the greater the accuracy. A six inch barrel gives enough spin to guarantee about as much accuracy as you will need when using your pistol.\r\n\r\nThe glamor weapon among pistols is the automatic, especially the .45. It is heavier, bulkier and more than twice as expensive as the .38. Its main claim to fame is its stopping power. But a well-placed bullet is a greater guarantee of stopping power than a bullet''s size. And as the article shows, speed comes with practice. Reliance in mechanics over skill leads to overconfidence. Many glamor gun fantasizers are going to die when they confront a foe who has mastered his weapon.\r\n\r\nYou may know of whole police departments adopting .357 Magnums or automatics. Maybe their chief watched too much TV. Again, skill with a basic weapon is better than reliance on mechanics or power. The punk spraying lead is no match for a cop skilled with his .38.\r\n\r\nNow for aiming. The reason for aiming is to hit the target at a greater distance than is practical for pointing. A rifleman hits everything he aims at. A macho fool just bangs away with a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing; except the deserved death of the ignorant.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, few people aim today. They have mistaken multiple loud reports for damage. One has but to watch newsreels of Arab-Christian conflicts in Lebanon, closeup coverage of the fire fights in Vietnam, the results of drive-by shootings in Los Angeles, etc., to see that moderns simply are not learning to shoot accurately. The discrepancy between shots fired and clean kills is appalling. Our honored WW II dead are spinning in their graves!\r\n\r\nAside from a shotgun or pistol, one should not own a gun not designed for aimed hits. Anyone who advertises such a gun should be boycotted as a traitor to his country. Those who decry the deaths of little children should shame the incompetents but not spare the sellers of weapons which flatter such ineptitude.\r\n\r\nI got a laugh from a news report some time ago. A character named T. J. Johnston in California, an anti-gun-registration-protester, was burning his order to register his assault weapon. His cronies were banging away at some targets ten yards away with more assault weapons. No rifleman would waste ammo shooting at a target that close.\r\n\r\nIf he goes to jail he might have time to reflect that one rifleman with an M1 30-06 Garand could wipe out his whole flock. He might also reflect that a well-regulated militia made up of private citizens proficient in the use of real weapons would have no fear of gun confiscation.\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard of Sergeant Alvin York? You have probably seen the movie, starring Gary Cooper. York was a conscientious objector. But when his friends were dropping like flies he reacted. A hillbilly, he was a trained hunter from childhood.\r\n\r\nHe first worked his way around the enemy''s flank. He was armed with a 1903 30-06 bolt-action Springfield and a pistol. He killed 20 Germans and captured l32. Of course, few of those captured knew it was a one-man job. The point is, he could shoot! He killed 20 men with one well-placed bullet each. He had no need for rapid-fire. He knew that every time he aimed and fired a man was dead.\r\n\r\nMost American and German soldiers at that time, with their bolt-action Springfields and Mausers could also shoot. They had to work those bolts and correct every time they fired. And there were men actually trying to kill them all the while! There was no getting around their having to know how to aim and shoot. No room for fantasy.\r\n\r\nAmong the best combat rifles ever made is the WW II U.S. M1 30-06 Garand. It is a semi-auto with a 1,000 yard effective killing range. It holds only eight rounds so there is no tendency to bang away at a single target.\r\n\r\nHowever, don''t discount the bolt-action rifle. After aiming and firing, the bolt is worked as the gun is reaimed, so no time is lost. Most good military and hunting rifles are bolt-action anyway.\r\n\r\nYou might be tempted to buy the most expensive rifle. But it is best to buy the most common, the tried and true, the least flashy.\r\n\r\nPause a minute to reflect; if you were driving cross-country on a very important trip, would you choose a common car or a sports model? Of course, you would look grand in the sportster. But if getting there were the only important consideration, you would want the reliability, and serviceability of your dependable standard model over the object of your fantasies.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for civilian combat. You may fantasize owning an expensive rapid-fire gun, mowing down raiders with ten slugs in each. It looks great in the movies, but why use 10 bullets where one would do? Besides, raiders won''t bunch up and charge. They will fan out, using what cover is available, and you will have to pick them off one by one.\r\n\r\nNow, if in your fantasies, you used a 30-06, preferably an M1 Garand, and could shoot, you could make your fantasies pay off. Then, with practice in making every bullet count, you could defend your territory against any number of predators.\r\n\r\nSo if you must fantasize about weapons, fantasize being a better shot than any thieving parasite. Fantasize putting one well-placed bullet into every looter with the stupidity to set foot in your community."', ''),

The heavier 147 grain bullets did not appear, or at least become popular, until the 1980s or 1990s. They were developed for use in 9mm submachine-guns that were widely used by units like the SAS, Seals, GSG-9, etc. The 147 grainers were not very popular or successful in pistols until fairly recently. While the 124 grain bullets might be a good compromise between 115 and 147 grain, they are at least 101 years old and far precede the 147 grain bullets.', ''),

Its barrels are very stiff in the vertical axis and the first barrel sits low causing little recoil and upward lift on firing, the second barrel gives a little up lift and a bit more recoil but it does not matter as it is the second round.\nAs pointed out already by worthy members the Trap and skeet guns are fired a 150 times in a short time  and cause the barrels to heat up so the ventilated mid rib and the top rib dissipate the heat where as in SxS the heat will cause mirage and practically cause blinding due heat waves.\nIn hunting there is a a lot of gap between shots where as in Trap and skeet one is firing continously; fifty shots in a round are fired in Trap and double trap.\nA SxS will be destroyed if used for Trap or Skeet unless it is heavy and built for this purpose in mind. Also the doubles give a lot of recoil and whips up where as the Over n Unders are stiffer and do not whip up. These differences can only be observed if one takes part in the sport.

At times, having a stock that has been well fitted to us is outside our reach. and how do we (the less fortunate souls) deal with the problem?\r\n\r\nUsually we ignore that there is a problem in the first place and learn to deal with it by crunching our head (or creeping up on the stock) and forcefully making a right cheek weld to acquire the right sight picture. That usually ends up costing us "precious time" in getting the sight picture right and denting our pride and confidence when a bird/clay is lost.\r\n\r\nThis is where [URL="http://www.graco-corp.com/"]adjustable combs[/URL] come into play. They offer us an ability to fit our shotgun to dimensions not offered by any off the shelf gun. Disbelievers would normally say “Get a custom stock”. However even the success of a custom stock depends on the accuracy of the measurements. How are those measurements derived? By shooting a gun that adjusts. That certainly makes a case that there is some value in a stock that adjusts as an intermediary step in the quest for perfection.\r\n\r\nWith all that, “[URL="http://www.graco-corp.com/"]Adjustable Comb Hardware[/URL] Installation” just had to be my next project. It looks easy though but was extremely complicated and not at all meant for the faint hearted, I am not going to list down the processes required to fit an [URL="http://www.graco-corp.com/"]Adjustable Comb Hardware[/URL] (available from [URL="http://www.graco-corp.com/"]http://www.graco-corp.com/[/URL]).

Believe me, a month of paper work was involved in getting all such questions answered. Had to design separate specialized jigs to hold the butt in place just right for the cutting and drilling.

Multiple specialists (local and foreign) were consulted just to find flaws in my proposed execution plan. Finally, when the time came, I summoned in all courage that I had and jumped in head first.

That\r\nremains to be seen. Long ago, I\r\nintentionally fed one of my A390 Gold Mallards over four cases of reasonably\r\ndirty reloads with no cleaning, hoping for\r\nsome jamming on the skeet field. I never\r\ncould get that 390 to jam, and finally just\r\ngave up the effort in delighted disgust.\r\nCertainly, the gun was filthy after that 1000 rounds of shooting, but I didn''t have\r\none single failure to eject or failure to\r\nfeed.

(358795, ' KARACHI, July 6: Alarmed by a massive increase in the cases of kidnapping for ransom and extortion, the business community has been running from pillar to post to get arms licences but the home department has obliged only a few applicants so far.\n\nKarachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) president Mohammad Saeed Shafiq told Dawn that around 30 members of the chamber had applied for arms licences but only two of them became successful over the last two-and-a-half-months. Prior to this, around 30 per cent of KCCI members (about 18,000) had succeeded in getting arms licences, he said.\n\nHe recalled that Interior Minister Rehman Malik had several times assured the KCCI that arms licences would be issued to its members on the recommendation of the chamber.\n\nThe KCCI chief noted that there had been an alarming rise in the kidnapping of businessmen and traders in the city while law and order situation had also deteriorated considerably, exposing its members to the threat posed by kidnappers,\nextortionists and criminals.\n\n&#8220;The chamber has been receiving eight to 10 such complaints every day mainly from industrialists and traders,&#8221; he said, adding that the victims usually did not opt for lodging an FIR fearing reprisals from the &#8216;mafia&#8217; and gangs harbouring the criminals.\n\nHe said the business community badly needed arms for self-protection but they were facing hardship in acquiring the licences.\n\nMr Shafiq also rejected the recent directive issued by the Provincial Police Officer, Wajid Ali Durrani, asking the business community and industrialists to seek permission for keeping arms. He argued that those already issued with arms licences did not need to seek a fresh permission to carry arms. Therefore, he informed KCCI members, the PPO&#8217;s directive in this regard was not acceptable to the chamber.\n\nThe All Karachi Tajir Ittehad chairman, Atiq Mir, claimed that some 8,000 traders had approached the organisation with request to help acquire arms licences for their self-defence.\n\nHe said the requests in such a big number were made without any announcement having been made by the organisation in this regard.\n\nNorth Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI) chairman Faraz Mirza also said that almost every member of his association needed arms for self-defence.\n\nHe said the association had urged the home department to lay down a procedure under which arms licences could be issued to all industrialists, watchmen and guards.', ''),

(358834, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nEven though rifles are not my specialty but kindly allow me share my two cents on the subject as I happen to know a thing or two about metallurgy.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, chromium in a Cr-moly steel (4140, 1% chromium content) is not to increase the wear resistance, it is there it give the metal more protection against corrosion. look at the following numbers:\r\n\r\nRockwell hardness of 4140: 28-32c\r\nRockwell hardness of chrome plating when using substrate of 4140: 67-71c\r\n\r\nSo, theoretically speaking, when we electroplate a cr-moly barrel with chromium we increase its surface hardness therefore giving it more wear resistance. however one must understand that any flaw in the substrate (the 4140 steel underneath the chrome layer) will be magnified by this process. one more thing, the actual distribution of the chromium on the substrate is also a PAIN-IN-THE-A$$ to control. there is practically no way to ensure that chrome plating thickness is absolutely uniform across the bore. one can come pretty close to perfection through the new more controlled processes of electroplating but still the THEORETICAL AND HIGHLY ELUSIVE perfect distribution of chromium is next to impossible. \r\n\r\nhere a comprise is made, if the designer wants more accuracy, either he will improve the quality of his machining (at times this is beyond his reach) then improving the quality of his chrome plating or he can simply skip the chrome platting process. we are moving with an assumption that rifle accuracy can be significantly reduced with just a microscopic flaw in the machining.\r\n\r\nmilitary rifles are generally not that accurate, they are primarily designed for reliability in adverse field conditions. therefore chrome plating is a must in this case as it will increase the wear resistance, increasing the life of the barrel, plus chrome is a lot easier to clean. it will not foul as much as bare steel. so what if it reduces the accuracy by say 5% (just a figure)?\r\n\r\nhowever whenever you''ll find high precision military rifles, built only for precise shooting such as a sniper rifle, you''ll always find that its barrels are never hard chromed from inside. here a 5% reduction in accuracy would prove to be nothing short of a sin.\r\n\r\none thing I would like to point out is that you can increase the wear resistance of a barrel without chrome plating as well. you can always heat treat (rather difficult inside the bore), you can always use hammer forge which packs the steel''s molecules together making it work hardened or you can using nitriding process to increase the surface hardness of the steel.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Can someone please provide me a link/softcopy of all arms and ammunition regulations applicable to my licenses.\n \nAlso, I am very ambiguous about the carrying arms with me on the move. If I have the license in my name and with me, then can I carry arms with me anywhere along with licenses?\n \nIn an All Pakistan license, can I carry arms with me throughout Pakistan along with the license? And what about during travel by plane/train/bus etc? Will the police have any objection while their random snap checking when they find me with my weapon and license?\n \nAnd in what condition should the gun legally be in travel? I mean gun and magazine separate, or loaded and ready to fire?\n \nAlso, I am unclear about the much heard "144" regulation. What is it all about? How do we know when it applies and when it is lifted?\n \nAnd when there is a ban on carrying weapons, does this mean we cannot carry weapons with us even when accompanied with our license? Do we have to keep all weapons at home only when this ban applies?\n \nLastly, when taking weapons on the move for selling/exchanging or when taking to the gunsmith for repair/purchase of parts etc, can we take the weapon for this reason when there is a ban on carrying weapons? Or even this is prohibited?\n \nWhat shall actually be a crime as per gun regulations regarding carrying weapons that could cause trouble during police check?\n \nThanks for your patience and kindly clarify my whole lot of queries.

It has to be light from 6 1/4 to 7 pounds with no ventilated  mid rib. \r\nThe Trap / skeet guns are not carried so these can be heavy going upto 7 1/2 pounds or more. Its barrels are very stiff in the vertical axis and the first barrel sits low causing little recoil and upward lift on firing, the second barrel gives a little up lift and a bit more recoil but it does not matter as it is the second round.\r\nAs pointed out already by worthy members the Trap and skeet guns are fired a 150 times in a short time  and cause the barrels to heat up so the ventilated mid rib and the top rib dissipate the heat where as in SxS the heat will cause mirage and practically cause blinding due heat waves.\r\nIn hunting there is a a lot of gap between shots where as in Trap and skeet one is firing continously; fifty shots in a round are fired in Trap and double trap.\r\nA SxS will be destroyed if used for Trap or Skeet unless it is heavy and built for this purpose in mind. Also the doubles give a lot of recoil and whips up where as the Over n Unders are stiffer and do not whip up. These differences can only be observed if one takes part in the sport.

[Note: assume our greenwing teals instead of cinnamon and bluewing teal decoys here. Mix gwteals+mallard hens+shovelers only in early season for our areas]: \r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/WF_teal_0810D.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n...Or reverse the extended line of decoys as per preference like here ..sketch is just rough drawn by me:\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/WaterDecoyRtSpread_3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n....And, here is the teal early season decoy spread idea in which mallard (dull colors) only hens plus teals are good plus shovelers few:\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/Tealdecoysetup.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n...Here is one of my pictures of decoy spread in which following next 2 pictures (diagrams) seem more like resembling it. The next 2 diagrams have cross marked as blind but you can say that cross was shifted to the center of the decoy setup in the MIDST of the decoy setup with small pockets in 360 degrees all around as ducks were coming from all directions frantically; and the nearest decoy was set set as close as 5 yards, making the blind merge with the decoys. This is a mutliple pocket setup in arrival times especially and one can also put pintail, teal, mallard, gadwall, shoveler, pochard (last two if available) in say small groups of 6 or 8 decoys per species, with pintails at the most forward location for max visibility:\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/IMAG0357_downsized-e.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/EarlySeasonMultiSpeciesDuckDecoySpread.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/diagram1b.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSo, these spread ideas are just ideas and one can adapt them easily to one''s own localized area specific hunts. There is no hard and fast rule in decoying and decoy spreads. But laying down an effective spread which clicks that day is a great boost to overall hunting that day because of ducks coming as near as 10-20 yards for clear and multiple shots.

I''m not sure what you think, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with looking like a desi (as we are and I am a proud one too), or having brown skin, or having a beard (many of the nicest people I have met, and including our prophet had a beard so I am not sure where you are coming from brother). Also I am not sure what exactly is so much better in looking like a Latin america (though I think you meant Latin American). People are people, regardless of the dress they wear, or the beard they keep, or the skin they were born with without their choice. Goes for those who look down on white/yellow/black or brown coloured people. And most importantly atleast you should have self respect (for who and what you are) so that others may respect you too. Should be proud of your language, your shalwaar or Dhotee for that matter, beard, religion, skin colour and for being a desi because believe me, regardless of how much one looks down on these things, you will still look brown unless you are Michael Jackson and even have blonde babies.....\nJust hope you get the point Salman bhai.

If I have the license in my name and with me, then can I carry arms with me anywhere along with licenses?[/QUOTE]\n   Yes you can carry your gun where ever you want to .If you are travelling to other province then chk that does your licence is all Pakistan . and when carrying your weapon chk how many number of bullets are allowed to carry . and count them again when leaving from house coz even a single bullet extra than the limit allowed is illegal to carry.\n\n[QUOTE]In an All Pakistan license, can I carry arms with me throughout Pakistan along with the license? And what about during travel by plane/train/bus etc? Will the police have any objection while their random snap checking when they find me with my weapon and license?[/QUOTE]\n\n   Yes you can travel all Pakistan with a valid all Pakistan licence . If you travel by air as you enters the security area tell them that you have a gun . before going to airport make surre that  your mag is  empty and store both gun & ammo in a lock box . The ASF staff will chk your licence , gun , ammo and then they will keep in their custody and will be delivered to you on reaching your destination . Same if you taravel by bus or train inform the security staff there . Police will have no objection if you found with a handgun . Cooperate with them , show your lic , id card if asked . But make sure again the city you are travelling is free from sec 144 or not  . \n\n[QUOTE]And in what condition should the gun legally be in travel? I mean gun and magazine separate, or loaded and ready to fire?[/QUOTE]\n  when traveeling by air keep mag empty and ammo seperarte . both stored in a lockable box . and while travelling in bus or train this will not imply . you can keep the gun with you if the security satff allows \n\n[QUOTE]Also, I am unclear about the much heard "144" regulation. What is it all about? How do we know when it applies and when it is lifted?[/QUOTE]\n  Dear section 144 comes under many jurisdications. like Sec 144 imposed on pillion riding . Sec 144 imposed on carrying Arms + Pillion riding + 2 or more than 2 persons cannot gather on streets , roads etc . So first see which section of 144 is imposed and then plan yourself to go out . and we never know when it is imposed and when lifted . keep yourself update with news . Usually section 144 is imposed in worst situations in order to keep the city safe \n\n[QUOTE] And when there is a ban on carrying weapons, does this mean we cannot carry weapons with us even when accompanied with our license? Do we have to keep all weapons at home only when this ban applies?[/QUOTE]\n  Yes when there is ban on carrying weapons your licence stands cancelled . So dont carry your weapon better to keep them at home while leaving. Carry means you are armed and your gun is with u in your holster on your back . On the otherside you can keep it in your car as it is you personal property but the weapon should not be armed . Same apply''s ammo seperate and mag empty .\n[QUOTE]\nLastly, when taking weapons on the move for selling/exchanging or when taking to the gunsmith for repair/purchase of parts etc, can we take the weapon for this reason when there is a ban on carrying weapons? Or even this is prohibited?[/QUOTE]\n         It is prohibited.\n[QUOTE] What shall actually be a crime as per gun regulations regarding carrying weapons that could cause trouble during police check?[/QUOTE]\n     1) If you have excessive amount of ammo than allowed it is a crime . \n     2) Carrying a weapon during sec 144 \n     3) Carrying weapons where weapons is strictly not allowed like Airport , Courts , etc \n\n   Hope i have answered all your queries up to my knowledge .', ''),

Neverthless, some broad guidelines do help hunters in general ... have worked for me. @TR, I use an inflatable boat, 10 horsepowered motor boat (6 person cap) and Jimny 4x4 (and potohars) for almost all my hunts, so whenever there is route problem(s), I stop short of route, take a detour and use the advantage of a motor boat with ample capacity for 4 plus dozen decoys to go upstream or downstream and reach our target destination... which certainly helps in countering your mentioned problem.

Mods may delete the post if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ) Can someone please provide me a link/softcopy of all arms and ammunition regulations applicable to my licenses.\r\n\r\n[B]A) Don''t go after the regulations mentioned in the book. Law enforcement agencies are themselves not familiar with the book laws. \r\nInstead find out about the laws which are practiced on the ground.[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ) Also, I am very ambiguous about the carrying arms with me on the move. If I have the license in  my name and with me, then can I carry arms with me anywhere along with licenses?\r\n\r\n[B]A) Yes you can carry your weapon in a concealed manner when section 144 regarding arms is not imposed. Still, however you may not be allowed to carry your weapon at public places e.g banks, shopping malls, government offices etc. In that case you will have to declare and handover\r\nyour weapon to the security check at the entrance.[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ) In an All Pakistan license, can I carry arms with me throughout Pakistan along with the license? And what about during travel by plane/train/bus etc? Will the police have any objection while their random snap checking when they find me with my weapon and license?\r\n\r\n[B]A) Yes you may carry your weapon throughout Pakistan. If you have Islamabad license (MOI) then you should have your original I.D card with you otherwise law enforcers can detain you because there is no photograph on MOI and without I.D card they cannot verify if the license belongs\r\nto you.Regarding air travel, you will have to declare your weapon at the first security check-in. Magazines should be removed with no bullets in them.\r\nGun, bullets and magazines should be kept seperately in a box/bag which can take a lock. Bullets should not be more than the limit mentioned on the license.[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ) And in what condition should the gun legally be in travel? I mean gun and magazine separate, or loaded and ready to fire?\r\n\r\n[B]A) answered above.[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ) Also, I am unclear about the much heard "144" regulation. What is it all about? How do we know when it applies and when it is lifted?\r\n\r\n[B]A) Imposition of 144 on arms means that you cannot carry your weapon even in concealed manner. It is normally conveyed to the public through print and electronic media whenever the ban is imposed or lifted. You may also give a call to any arms dealer and inquire about its status.[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ) And when there is a ban on carrying weapons, does this mean we cannot carry weapons with us even when accompanied with our license? Do we have to keep all weapons at home only when this ban applies?\r\n\r\n[B]A) Yes, you cannot carry your weapon with license when the ban is imposed. If you still want to carry it during the ban then you have to take special permission from the Home Department. They issue a letter which allows you to carry a weapon even when 144 on arms is imposed. It is\r\neasy to get permission. Either go to the Home department and apply one with a good reason or pay a few bucks and apply it through any arms dealer.[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ) Lastly, when taking weapons on the move for selling/exchanging or when taking to the gunsmith for repair/purchase of parts etc, can we take the weapon for this reason when there is a ban on carrying weapons? Or even this is prohibited?\r\n\r\n[B]A) In the above case when 144 on arms is imposed, you can transport your weapon from home to dealer and vice versa. Pack the weapon without its magazine in a newspaper and apply scotch tape. Pack the magazine/s seperately. No need to take bullets along.[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ) What shall actually be a crime as per gun regulations regarding carrying weapons that could cause trouble during police check?\r\n\r\n[B]A) carrying a weapon without license.\r\n    carrying a weapon on MOI license and not having I.D card.\r\n    carrying a weapon in an un-concealed manner e.g keeping a loaded weapon on the passenger seat.\r\n    carrying a weapon without Home department''s special permission to carry during 144 imposition  on arms.\r\n    carrying bullets more in number than allowed on the license.[/B]', ''),

I have had quite a few acquaintances who had been  kidnapped this way. \nInitially there were reports of kidnappers using cars to pull over the  victim''s vehicle, but lately the tricks are getting increasingly  sophisticated with kidnappers in groups of motorbikes and vehicles  together forcing the victim''s car to stop and then abducting the victim.\n\nIn practice, my plan is difficult to implement. Normal reflex is to hit  the brakes and stop when another vehicle comes suddenly in front. Also, in a major city like Karachi, Lahore etc there are at least a dozen motorbikes/ vehicles that come in front one my vehicle due to sheer recklessness or carelessness on part of their operators. Surely, running them down cannot be a practical solution :/\n\nWhat to do in such a situation?Maybe we all together can come up with a strategy that would not cause others harm and keep us safe in such a situation?', ''),

(359059, 'Accurising a Rifle and Developing Accurate Loads [QUOTE=PakistanFirst;197679]Skeeter60, \nWe need to start discussion about improving accuracy. I spent many hours on my Ruger M77 .308 target rifle to squeeze the last ounce of performance - from polishing the bore, developing various loads, trimming barrel length - inch by inch to measuring brass dimension with caliper, measuring propellant and bullet weight to within 0.1 gram, using competition-grade dies for seating bullets with a micrometer-type seater and measuring cartridge over-all length from ogive to the cartridge base with a gauge. I am equipped to precision reload .308 & .223. \n \nUntil now, beside you, I have seen anyone come forward wanting to start discussion on this topic. Most here just shy away from this sort of discussion - perhaps thinking the subject being too complex, lacking knowledge and/or lacking equipment/tools.\n \nIf just a fraction of the time and energy spent here in discussing the various calibers were devoted to methods and steps in improving accuracy, the rewards will follow.[/QUOTE]\n \nIn view of your experience I presume your Telescope and Mounts are tight and snug and The M77 has fool proof rings and  existing base on the rifle so these would not be a problem.\nDo you have the M77 Mk 1 or 2?\nI am sure your stock screws are also tight and the Telescope is a quality optic like a Leupold, or any other German or Austrian make. I Have some questions to ask;\n1. Is your Rifle Barrel Free floated ? Have you done it or not ?\n2. Is the Action bedded in Epoxy or steel Epoxy by you ?\n3. Are you familiar with Pillar Bedding?\n4. Please do not trim down the barrel, the factory Muzzle Crown is 45 Degrees but most accuracy is achieved by using an 11 Degree Crown specially when using BOAT TAIL BULLETS . For this you will have to buy a proper 11 Degree Muzzle Crowning Tool\nEach rifle is an Enigma it likes certain weights and shapes of Bullets and shoots others in accurately. In your .308 Win start with quality bullets like Nosler Ballistic Tips, you can buy packs of 50 bullets  each of 165 grains and also 150 grains.\nBuy some 150 grain Sierras and also Sierra Match King 165 /168 grain match bullets.\nYou could also try Speer bullets in 150 and 165 grains to see which bullets give the best performance.\nThe SEATING DEPTH of bullets in the case is very important, usually the bullets seated close to the rifling give optimum results. The bullets should be seated 1/32 or 1/28 inches short of rifling. This will ensure proper feeding and no stuck bullets when you want to unload a chambered round.\nMake a Dummy bullet with no primer and no Powder in the case and slightly dent the UN SIZED, case mouth with your teeth, now seat a bullet by hand and then after chambering it close the bolt and remove the dummy cartridge.\nYou will now have a cartridge with Zero free bore, now you measure it and seat a batch of bullets 1/32 inches deeper into the primed cases charged with your favourite powder. Shoot two 5 shot groups at a 100 yds and then seat a next bach of same bullets and powder and seat the bullets deeper by  1/28 inches. By seating the bullets deeper or further out,  you will find a sweet spot, which for that particular bullet, case and type and weight of powder will be the magic seating depth.\nI find which bullets suit my rifle best for accuracy and then I buy in bulk. The Nosler Ballistic Tips , The Hornady and Speer are all Good bullets and so are Sierra.\nTweaking the powder also increases or decrease accuracy.\nDO NOT EVER EXCEED the max load of a particular powder behind a given bullet. Start with about 10 % less and then gradually increase in one grain increments and fire 5 shot groups to find out the max accurate loading.\nCase Preparation is very important specially if you have an accurate rifle, use the same make of cases resize and trim to same length, uniform the flash hole with a 5 dollar tool and in case you want most accuracy, weigh your cases and segregate cases heavier then the average weight you determine and also the ones lighter than the average weight. This way you will have three batches of cases. You can give a lee way of upto 5 or 10 grains either way so your max weight variation between cases will be within 10 or 20 grains.\nI have given a general overall picture of the mechanics of developing accurate loads. I also touched upon the various things we have to do to a rifle to make it accurate.\nIf you find the method put up intersting I will take up each step at length and describe every thing in detail.\nYou will end burning a 20 Dollar can of a pound of propellant and about a 100 bullets costing the same but you will have a very accurate load for your rifle. Some rifles shoot flat base bullets more accurately and some otherwise.\nI can dwell on \nFREE FLOATING the Barrel\nGLASS BEDDING the ACTION\nPILLAR BEDDING  if you so desire\nMuzzle Crowning (never with the case Chamferring tool please)\nAdjusting the Trigger\nMy favourite powders are IMR 4350, 4895, 4831 ( in case of .308 win IMR 4895 ) For my Magnums I use Norma MRP and IMR 4831 and IMR 7828, also the versatile IMR 4350.\nThe bullet seating depth is very important and you can use different methods of determining your Max Cartridge Over All Length COAL like by using a steel rod and also by blackening a dummy bullet with candle smoke or your wife" eye brow pencil and then chambering the dummy round to see at what COAL the rifling or land marks appear on the shank of each type of bullet.\nBest of Luck and TIGHT GROUPS', ''),

(359264, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nwent to the range today and tried adjusting the comb to get a 60/40 pattern at 16 yards. why 16 yards? so that I could easily calculate how much the comb needs to be moved. for every inch the pattern was to be off, I was supposed to move the comb to 1/16 inch to compensate.\r\n\r\nfor example: if the point of impact is off by four inches, I am supposed to move the comb by 4/16 inches.\r\n\r\nanyways, here is the result:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/09072011051.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nnow there is something which has bothered me. I should have stamped some lines on the post and the comb to visually know how much the comb has moved in any direction after adjusting. since I did not stamp in any such lines during fabrication, there was no way of knowing how much the comb has moved. for large movements it was ok, but for small/tiny movements it was very difficult knowing that the posts have moved at all or not. similarly since there were no lines on the posts or the rectangular base plate there was no way of judging minute changes required in cast. for large movements it was ok but for minute changes it was very difficult. I was either moving it too less or moving it too much. I SHOULD HAVE STAMPED SOME LINES ON IT FOR REFERENCE. but anyways, the process of adjusting took a little longer than I thought due to absence of the lines. it was still fun at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

This way decoys when thrown in waters don&#8217;t appear facing in same direction which is unnatural for real ducks. They would this way face different directions. Real ducks do not face in same direction on water. \r\nAlso, another issue is stationery ducks: In no wind or less water currents, as is commonly seen, all decoys (I prefer about 18-24 in early season & 30-36 or more later) look like dead birds. For that, some movement in them needs to be created .. that is important I believe. For that, many cheap movement creating options as well as expensive ones are all helpful in getting the ducks to come closer to hide/decoys. Try them. In creating motion-in-air, large sized male mallard mojos are of limited utility in my opinion and a mallard mojo only works good on very early flights of season. But they are in vogue here :). Later in season the ducks get smart and flashing wings of mallard mojos have been seen by us to scare them rather than bringing them closer over decoys. Most of times, I switch the male mallard mojo off via remote after seeing ducks heading towards us from a distance. As an alternative, I am thinking of trying a new moving type motion decoy in market now for last year, which does not spin wings like a mojo, yet creates a flying bird effect, looks more natural just like a real bird. I have a hunch that it would be much more beneficial for our areas because of heavy hunting pressures here and almost every other party with 1-2 mojos deployed among decoys. &#8216;Mojos ne rull macha di hai .. murghabi bhi mojos se darti hai ab, except earlier naïve birds&#8217;. \r\nRegards.', ''),

(359353, ' The Remington 870 was the fourth major design in a series of Remington pump shotguns. John Pedersen designed the fragile Remington Model 10 (and later the improved Remington Model 29). Working with John Browning, Pedersen also helped design the Model 17 which was adopted by Ithaca as the Ithaca 37 and also served as the basis for the Remington 31. The Model 31 was well liked,[5] but struggled for sales in the shadow of the Winchester Model 12. Remington sought to correct that in 1950 by introducing a modern, streamlined, rugged, reliable, and relatively inexpensive shotgun - the 870 Wingmaster.\r\n\r\nSales of the 870 have been steady. They reached 2 million guns by 1973 (ten times the number of Model 31 shotguns it replaced). By 1996, spurred by the basic "Express" model, sales topped seven million guns. On April 13, 2009 the ten millionth Model 870 was produced, and the 870 holds the record for best-selling shotgun in the history of the world.\r\nCourtesy: Wikipedia', ''),

He informed tha a new stock of Baikal has arrived and fewer than 10 shot guns are available, hurry and get one. Next, I arrived at the dealer shop. Naveed was already waiting for me. He selected and negotiated the price because it had went up. Within the 20 minutes I purchased the Gun: Baikal MP-27- EM-1C.\r\nIt was love at the first sight. It fits in my hand like a glove. I shot 30 shells from 50 yards and 30 yards. I used Shaheen 3 inches # 4, Shaheen # 6 and Roy # 4. All hit the target except the first one. It was rapid shooting.\r\n          EM-1C is atypical gun. Its finest feature is its safety. A 8 years old child can turn the safety turn on and off. Safety is smooth. To open Breach is not the struggle anymore either. Just point and shoot, no need to wrestle with aim. Beed is a small but that is the way I wanted.\r\n          So, I am a happy and lucky man who owns three world&#8217;s finest shot guns and I call it triple &#8220;BBB&#8221;: Baikal, Browning and Beretta.

A rifled slug is easily capable of taking down any Boar/Deer sized animal at ranges out to 60-70 yards. if you want to increase the killing range beyond that, then you''ll have to use a sabot slug (out of a rifled barrel). that can easily reach 100-150 yards and can easily take down its intended game at 100+ yards.

(359591, ' report of a 1911 magazine that was stored fully loaded for 70+ years and functioned perfectly when tried.\r\n\r\nThis subject comes up fairly regularly, and in one thread (somewhere, don''t know where) a metallurgist reported rather authoritatively that the "wear" on a magazine spring comes from cycling it full to empty and back again, not from compressing the spring and leaving it compressed. So you''ll "wear out" a magazine faster if you cycle ammo through it than if you just load it up and leave it.\r\n\r\nThere was an exception to this general rule, and that is if the spring is compressed beyond some elastic limit (I think he called it). If you compress a spring TOO far it may not come back fully to its uncompressed length and strength, even if you onlly compress it once. The concern arises particularly in high capacity magazines where the last round puts a real scrunch on the spring (design problem) or where you try to squeeze one extra round in (operator error.)\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was, load ''em up and leave ''em. If you''re concerned about potential damage, download by one round as others have suggested, but do not load and unload a mag thinking you''re extending the life of the spring.\r\n\r\nSince LEOs keep their magazines fully loaded for months on end, I doubt it''s much of a problem.\r\n\r\nNot really. They typical LEO shoots his gun very little, and then primarily when he''s qualifying, which may be as infrequently as once or twice a year. \r\n\r\nLEO, with exceptions, are NOT gun USERS or SHOOTERS, but gun CARRIERS. A surprisingly small number of them are truly gun enthusiasts. They could have a mag problem and not know it until its time to use the gun. Then, too, they have armorers who look for things like springs that need replacement... \r\n\r\nThe only people who seem to suffer from spring burn out in their magazines are the military guys who constantly compress and release springs due to the number of rounds they typically put through service weapons.Compressing and releasing springs do cause long-term wear, but so does compressing them fully when loading them to the max.\r\n\r\nFully loaded 1911 magazines have been found 60 years after they were loaded, and they still worked perfectly.True. But, keep in mind that those are all seven rounders. The same is not true 8 rounders, which have long been the source of problems for 1911 shooters. \r\n\r\nTen-round mags in other guns will work well after long-term storage, but hi-caps can be a problem.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experts, folks like the engineers at Wolff springs, and a metallurgist or two who have participated here and elsewhere, it depends:\r\n\r\nSprings wear, over time, through use. Working the springs (flexing them, as in normal use) will cause wear, over time. But they wear FASTER and more dramatically as they are pushed (expanded or compressed) to their design limits. \r\n\r\nA well-designed, quality spring in a high-cap mag, left fully loaded and fully compressed will, generally, degrade faster than the same spring downloaded a round or two. But mag design and how the spring was made to work with the mag matters, too.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-204014.html[/url]', ''),

(359699, ' [QUOTE=Survivalist;198311]report of a 1911 magazine that was stored fully loaded for 70+ years and functioned perfectly when tried.\n\nThis subject comes up fairly regularly, and in one thread (somewhere, don''t know where) a metallurgist reported rather authoritatively that the "wear" on a magazine spring comes from cycling it full to empty and back again, not from compressing the spring and leaving it compressed. So you''ll "wear out" a magazine faster if you cycle ammo through it than if you just load it up and leave it.\n\nThere was an exception to this general rule, and that is if the spring is compressed beyond some elastic limit (I think he called it). If you compress a spring TOO far it may not come back fully to its uncompressed length and strength, even if you onlly compress it once. The concern arises particularly in high capacity magazines where the last round puts a real scrunch on the spring (design problem) or where you try to squeeze one extra round in (operator error.)\n\nThe conclusion was, load ''em up and leave ''em. If you''re concerned about potential damage, download by one round as others have suggested, but do not load and unload a mag thinking you''re extending the life of the spring.\n\nSince LEOs keep their magazines fully loaded for months on end, I doubt it''s much of a problem.\n\nNot really. They typical LEO shoots his gun very little, and then primarily when he''s qualifying, which may be as infrequently as once or twice a year. \n\nLEO, with exceptions, are NOT gun USERS or SHOOTERS, but gun CARRIERS. A surprisingly small number of them are truly gun enthusiasts. They could have a mag problem and not know it until its time to use the gun. Then, too, they have armorers who look for things like springs that need replacement... \n\nThe only people who seem to suffer from spring burn out in their magazines are the military guys who constantly compress and release springs due to the number of rounds they typically put through service weapons.Compressing and releasing springs do cause long-term wear, but so does compressing them fully when loading them to the max.\n\nFully loaded 1911 magazines have been found 60 years after they were loaded, and they still worked perfectly.True. But, keep in mind that those are all seven rounders. The same is not true 8 rounders, which have long been the source of problems for 1911 shooters. \n\nTen-round mags in other guns will work well after long-term storage, but hi-caps can be a problem.\n\nAccording to the experts, folks like the engineers at Wolff springs, and a metallurgist or two who have participated here and elsewhere, it depends:\n\nSprings wear, over time, through use. Working the springs (flexing them, as in normal use) will cause wear, over time. But they wear FASTER and more dramatically as they are pushed (expanded or compressed) to their design limits. \n\nA well-designed, quality spring in a high-cap mag, left fully loaded and fully compressed will, generally, degrade faster than the same spring downloaded a round or two. But mag design and how the spring was made to work with the mag matters, too.\n\n[url]http://www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-204014.html[/url][/QUOTE]\n\nDear Bro, now the question arises when a LEO friend visits me and always treat me like i know nothing abt how to take care of my guns n ammo, and always asks me to keep my mags  less than 100% capacity.\n\nWhen a magazine is kept fully loaded, does it builds a compression "memory"??  meaning that if you keep it compressed, the spring will lose it''s  ability to push the rounds up when it is needed.\n\nWhat this means in reality is that you have a potential  situation where you believe you are safe with 10-15 rounds of ammunition  in your mags and if the situation ever arose where you needed your  weapon, the first round or maybe two will fire and then stop. The  magazine spring will not push the third round up for the slide to load, SO does it happens in anyway in modern firearms.....if the mag springs in real are the culprits why accidentally blame our quality guns...', ''),

That was a marvelous effort. I have a query i.e. What can you say about the gun patterns of these last two versions of semi-autos by Beretta - AL391 Urika2 (Optimachoke Plus) Versus A400 Unico Xplor (Optimachoke Plus HP)??? Is one better than other in patterns with #8 and 4# Shaheen regular cartridge, say at nominal range of 30 yards???

Majority of known sites don''t accept Pakistani Cards (Credit, Debit, VISA... etc) because our country is not in their list.\n2. None of the site delivered these kind of stuff in Pakistan (they delivered with-in UK or near by)\n3. Delivery charges varies from site to site, fix/normal charges are between 3-8 pounds and also depends on items/volume. \n\nhere is the last and most important point,\n\n4. If any site would accept our card and confirmed order placed even then its not guaranteed that our things will be delivered even with-in UK.  (That''s exactly happened with me) \n\nI have found 4 different good online sites (UK Based) for these kind of stuff and 3 of them didn''t accept my card not even my friend''s credit card but the 4th one did accept my card confirm my order placed and full amount deducted from my card. It was 5 working days to delivered my pellets in Birmingham after 5 days I didn''t get even their dispatched confirmation so I email them to ask for this matter and get their reply back mentioning "sorry for this inconvenience, some of your card details/record are missing therefore we are unable to dispatched your items, kindly call us at ********* this number etc etc"\n\nSo I had to call them and asked for it  what details/record are missing and if this is the case then why did they charged me at the first place ?  They said we recently started this new security procedure for online orders and before dispatching we match the cards information/details with the delivery address or at-least card/bank should be registered here and your card''s security code and other details is not matching with our record so we hold your order until its confirmed that you are the original owner/holder of this card.... etc etc\n\nAfter more then 10 mint of negotiation/discussion my patience finally paid me at the end and they agreed to reimburse me and allowed me to charge this same order on any of the UK-based card.  So I requested my person to charge on his card and then finally he received my package after couple of days. After this I didn&#8217;t use my own card for any online shopping. \n\nMy Bad that pellets are still with him in UK and waiting for someone who would be visiting back to Pakistan :(', ''),

(360035, ' [FONT=Verdana]I must admit that although I am still a novice in rifle scope use, there are some fundamental features of scope accuracy that I have comprehended and applied in practical situations. I would certainly share them with fellow enthusiasts.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Verdana]Its so common to hear new air gunners complaining of total chaos after putting a scope to their rifle.I have already, in my earlier posts in this thread, highlighted some factors which are the culprit causes. Today I wish to further deliberate the factors effecting accuracy,and how to overcome them.I think its good to take a look at a scope and understand the parts first :[/FONT]\n\n[IMG]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb453/jhallu/ExternalNomenclatureMedium.jpg[/IMG]\n \n\n \n[B][FONT=Verdana]What Makes a Scope Accurate?[/FONT][/B]\n[FONT=Verdana]Proper Focus[B],[/B] Correction of Parallax Error; Adjustment Consistency; and a Solid, Well Aligned Mounting System.[/FONT]\n \n[B][FONT=Verdana]What Makes a Scope See Better?[/FONT][/B]\n[FONT=Verdana]Lens Quality, Lens Coatings, and Objective Lens Size... And knowing how to use the Fast Focus Eyepiece, which is provided in most of quality scopes.[/FONT]\n \n[B][FONT=Verdana]Proper Focus[/FONT][/B] \n\n[COLOR=black][FONT=Verdana]many users complain of having difficulty seeing through the scope, the images seem blurry.This is a result of improper focus.Remember that t[/FONT][/COLOR][FONT=Verdana]he scope needs to be focused only once-for YOUR eyes. If another shooter uses your scope, it must be refocused for their eyes. The following steps will assist in proper focusing of your scope [/FONT]\n[LIST=1]\n[*][FONT=Verdana]Look through the scope at a bright background such as the sky or a well lighted wall. (Never look at the sun!) Focusing is easier with the scope mounted on a rifle or some firm object. [/FONT]\n[*][FONT=Verdana]Turn the eyepiece, counter clockwise, until the reticle appears slightly blurred. [/FONT]\n[*][FONT=Verdana]Turn the eyepiece, clockwise, until the reticle comes into focus. [/FONT]\n[*][FONT=Verdana]Look away from the scope for a few seconds. Then look back quickly through the scope. If the reticle appears sharp and clear the instant you place your eye to the scope, the focus has been properly set for your eyes. Try this several times. [/FONT]\n[*][FONT=Verdana]If the reticle appears fuzzy, or requires a little time to come into sharp focus, further adjustment is needed. Turn the eyepiece clockwise another full turn and repeat STEP [/FONT]\n[*][FONT=Verdana]Keep doing this until the reticle is sharp the instant you put your eye to the scope.[/FONT]\n[/LIST]\n[B][FONT=Verdana]Parallax Error or Adjustable Objective Riflescopes[/FONT][/B]\n \n[FONT=Verdana]Parallax error occurs when changing positions of your eye,(in relation to the eye piece) will change the point of aim of your scope. The error is related to the distance the target is from you. Most sporting rifle scopes are set to be Parallax Error-Free at 100 yards. That is, when aiming through your scope at a target 100 yards away, the point of aim stays the same regardless of the position or movement of your eye.[/FONT]\n \n[B][FONT=Verdana]Parallax error compensation and focus adjustment[/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana] are different things. Some people often call parallax adjustment an "Adjustable Focus" or "Side-Focus". It''s NOT. You set the scope to be parallax error free at a certain distance. And if the image is not in focus, you focus it with your eyepiece. This is where the "Fast Focus Eyepiece" plays its role.[/FONT]\n \n[B][FONT=Verdana]Parallax error test[/FONT][/B]\n \n[FONT=Verdana]It&#8217;s pretty simple. To test your scope for parallax error, position your scope or scoped rifle in sand-bags so that it is aiming at a 50 yard target. Now, without touching the gun or the scope, move your head from side to side while looking through the scope. If the crosshair moves around on the target, you&#8217;re seeing parallax error at that distance. How much error depends on how much movement. To find the distance where your scope is parallax error-free, do this experiment at 40, 30, and 20 yards. The distance where it is error free will also be the distance at which you shoot most accurately. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Verdana]Scopes with an adjustable objective (AO) allow you to set the distance at which they are parallax error-free. These scopes are also designated as Parallax Adjustable (PA), Side Focusing (SF), etc. It''s misleading to call this feature "focusing" because its really parallax correction. Its also important to note that the distance markings on the parallax adjustment are quite often not exact.[/FONT]\n \n[B][FONT=Verdana]How critical Parallax adjustment is?[/FONT][/B]\n \n[COLOR=black][FONT=Verdana]Most scopes have a fixed parallax setting that is exactly correct for shooting at only "one" specific distance. If your scope has a parallax adjustment it can be perfectly adjusted for shooting at any distance, so that your crosshair will appear to be rock solid, no matter where your eye is positioned. The crosshair should appear stationary, as if they were painted on your target.This is very important when the "exact" position of your eye is not always concentric with your scope. The slightest variance can make a huge difference. [/FONT][/COLOR][FONT=Verdana]Scopes of lower magnification are not usually supplied with parallax adjustment , because at lower powers the amount of parallax is so small as to have no importance for practical, fast target acquisition.So if u are using a scope of magnification power upto 4 times, u are safe not to bother about the parallax error.For pinpoint aiming purposes,which is accomplished by greater magnification, parallax error is most critical at under 100 yard distances.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Verdana]Take a look at the images, indicating the position of parallax knob,or AO (adjustable objective) ring, on various scopes.The first three images are of scopes with parallax compensation around the objective lens.The rest of images are of scopes with parallax knob exactly opposite the windage knob, which is the most common scope design. note the large optional side wheel on the Leapers scope (last image)which makes parallax adjustment very easy. [/FONT]\n \n \n \n[IMG]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb453/jhallu/Swift687MSmall.jpg[/IMG]\n \n[IMG]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb453/jhallu/delta22.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb453/jhallu/8-Parallax-ring.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb453/jhallu/image008.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb453/jhallu/image010.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb453/jhallu/9-Leapers-optional-s_AFC49.jpg[/IMG] \n \n \n[FONT=Verdana]To adjust the parallax ensure that your scope reticle be clear and crisp on the object as you sight down your scope. [/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Next adjust the parallax while you move your head up and down slightly. Keep adjusting until there is no movement in the reticle in relation to the target.[/FONT]\n \n \n[B][FONT=Verdana]Eye relief[/FONT][/B]\n \n[FONT=Verdana]This refers to the distance at which you must place your eye behind the eyepiece of the scope in order to see the entire field of view. Although the optimum distance is quoted in specifications, there is usually some latitude so that your eye need not be placed at exactly the same place each time in order to see the whole field of view.Most of the scopes are designed to give you a clear sight pic at 3-4 inches from the eye piece to your eye.Eye relief changes on most scopes as they have a variable magnification, and eye relief depends on magnification. When the scope is adjusted for higher magnification, the eye relief will decrease; when it is adjusted for lower magnification, the eye relief increases.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]It is important to have perfect or at least good eye relief , before aiming at a target , as variations in eye relief will adversely effect the accuracy.[/FONT]\n \n[B][FONT=Verdana]Magnification or Power[/FONT][/B]\n \n[FONT=Verdana]The scope is often named by two numbers separated by an "x". For example: 3-9x40. The first number is the power or magnification of the scope. With a 3-9x40 variable power scope, the object being viewed appears to be 3 to 9 times closer than you would see it with the unaided eye. The second part number (40) is the diameter of the objective or front lens. The larger the objective lens, the more light that enters the scope, and the brighter the image. The higher magnification of a scope, however, is a double-edged sword. As magnification increases, many other things decrease: field of view,image steadiness, and sometimes image sharpness. Higher magnification also eats light. An 8-power scope will show the same image darker than a 4-power, if everything else is the same. There are ways to increase the amount of light that passes through the scope, such as larger lens diameters and even a large scope tube diameter, but if that goes too far you get a large scope that is more difficult to mount.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Verdana]The challenge in using a scope is to make magnification work for you and not against you. The basic rule is to use magnification sparingly--never sacrifice image detail or steadiness for image size. Small, steady, and sharp view is much preferred to a large, wobbly, and fuzzy scene, especially on small game. A variable power scope should be set to its lowest power for fast target acquisition. High powers should be reserved for long range, controlled shots.[/FONT]\n \n \n[FONT=Verdana]will deliberate on other aspects of scope accuracy shortly[/FONT]', ''),

But every body talking only about flesh on the bones and polish layers on the skull, but most important thing is fat in joints of the skull and in side the girth of the horn. \r\n\r\nSo always try to remove the fat from out side and inside the skulls and in horns (mountain Sheep and Goat horns only).\r\n\r\nMany kind of chemicals can be good solution, but most cheap, reliable and durable formula is, Boil the horns and skull in soda caustic mixed water, one gallon of water+4 spoons Soda and dip whole skull in solvent (first remove the horns from skull than put in water), check time by time and at normal flames you need 20 to 30 minutes boiling time for Urial skull. \r\n\r\nAfter that wash with Formulen (easily available at every medical store up-to 40-50 rupees) while washing use gloves avoid to dip your hand in Formulen. Finally dry in sunlight and you can apply any polish layer if you like,  otherwise no need.\r\nNow your desired skull is well preserved for many many years without any further treatment in the future.', ''),

(380779, ' [QUOTE=Gilani;86799]Quite an interesting discussion, enjoyed reading complete post. :)\n\nAs per my information, CF98 has been specifically developed as an official sidearm of Chinese Armed Forces. It was not adopted by Chinese Army after it was developed by Cheng Feng rather Cheng Feng developed it for Chinese Army. You see, there is a difference. This means users requirements (Chinese Army''s requirements) were fully incorporated or kept in mind by Cheng Feng while developing CF98. Unlike many Western countries where arms manufacturers are independent in developing weapons and after having developed a weapon, they present it to various armies / LEAs for trials as and when they are required, weapon manufacturing in China is still a state owned business. \n\nThe whole argument is that a weapon which has been specifically designed keeping in mind the requirements of the biggest army of the world (size wise) has to have something special about it with regards to reliability, accuracy, ruggedness and affordability (low price). These generally are the attributes of a military handgun. Probably thats why, Chinese have reduced the cost effect by compromising on the finish etc which is probably a secondary consideration when it comes to selecting weapons for military use and not apparently compromised on the first three attributes. \n\nNP22 / HP 77B / NP34 have been developed (or copied) keeping in mind the user requirements of civilian market, hence, better finish also gets priority. I am by no means trying to conclude that these are not reliable guns and only have a better finish. They may in certain cases prove far better than CF98. One has to, however, conduct extensive / prolonged trials to prove this. \n\nHistorically speaking, however, most famous / legendary weapons that we know became famous and legendary only after they were extensively used by armies / law enforcement agencies. Isn''t it :)  \n\nregards[/QUOTE]\n\n\nCF98 is chosen because its their OWN design and NP22 is a copy...\n\nif some has been to china he will tell you that they do copy everything for the whole world, but for them they prefer what is of their own even if its not better than the copy...\n\nall well made hand guns are some what similar, it depends on how much the shooter is comfortable with the gun... different hand guns are there for different hands!', ''),

THAT IS WHERE SELECTION OF PLACE PLANNING COMES IN. Brother do observe in my above pics, its river Chenab ( 1 pic) and Jhelum ( 2 pic) but we are not on main stream of river, WHY ?????\r\n\r\nBrother, Time selection in duck hunting is another key. Moonlights, Thunder Storms, Rainy Weathers, Floods, Bright Sunny mornings, Migration times,  has a very clear impact on ducks movement in Morning and Evening Hunts. So what to do in above mentioned scenarios. Selection and decision is going to be of you regarding TIME SELECTION, and off course it need only time and field experience. \r\n\r\nVehicle selection is yet another aspect is Duck Hunting in Rainy weathers and again debatable.\r\n\r\nBrother there are many more aspects, which i have missed as a human beings, that is why i or my fellow hunter call duck hunting a Science ( now a days) to you or others it might be Art, no issue no debate, its just the way how you look at things or how i look at them.\r\n\r\nFinally brother its a request, don''t pin point any individual name, in your messages as Mods have readily performed there Job. \r\n\r\nBest Regards.[/QUOTE]\r\nNo hard feelings my dear brother.... i used the name of person to discuss his concern anyways if my words seems to hurt someone i posses the courage to apologize.......any how i consider myself a very humble and low profile hunter, so person like me wants to learn at PG... i''ll definitely not try to involve in any unwanted discussion.... thanks for your concern and advise..', ''),

(360325, ' @HUNTER 1,,.... @M.ASIF KHAN, &#8230;... thanks for your asking and giving me a chance to share my duck shooting experience. Duck shooting is my favorite game since my teenage, I have been enjoyed the very good duck shoots at River Chenab, River Jhelum and River Attock (Indus). \r\n\r\nFirst Time I introduced duck shooting with decoys at Gujrat, In 1983 my uncle brought the decoys from USA(cork made floating decoys) later on I owned  the same 2 dozen decoys,  gifted by my Uncle. My uncle was my teacher in duck shooting and he transferred the practical knowledge of river hunting to me before the &#8220;Google World&#8221;.\r\n\r\nSince the early days of my duck shooting, I was collecting and reading the English game magazine &#8220;Field & Stream&#8221; and &#8220;Shooter&#8221;, I was buying fresh copies from Mr.Books at Super Market-Islamabad since 1987 till 1999. Till the moment I have few copies at my library. \r\n\r\nI red all famous articles from these magazines and later on some times on-line and I observed that at early days of my shooting experience, our Rivers hunting situations and patterns are totally different from Russia, USA and Canada. \r\n\r\nSo, I always preferred my own theory and field work for duck shoot at any period of the game season, which I learn from my seniors and field exercises.\r\n\r\n At the moment I am going to share my knowledge within the limits of current topic of this thread. Remember that I am not going to discuss the decoys spread and calling techniques already seniors and juniors have been share a lot in this regard.\r\n\r\nGUN AND AMMUNITION SELECTION;\r\nAccording to the choice and practice of individuals any favorite shotgun, choke and wings shooting load can be use at rivers.\r\n\r\nTIMING AND EQUIPMENTS FOR DUCK SHOOT AT ANY PART OF THE SEASON.\r\nFor the right approach at right timing hunters with equipped the right equipment (Boat/power Boat/4x4 for off road access) and can run these waterways and find some of the finest.  The timing must be right at any season. But when these elements are in place, rivers can be the best of all water fowler.\r\n\r\nDUCK SHOOT AT LATE MOON SOON \r\nSituations and conditions of our river are totally different from the other destinations like Russia, USA and Canada.\r\nAT above said countries the best condition for river duck shooting is during a hard freeze, (which is not available at our country) Current will keep free-flowing rivers open long after shallow marshes and flooded fields ice up. \r\n\r\nWhen the freezing cold hits, ducks will frequently feed in dry grain fields, then move to the rivers in the mid day. They will pile up along banks or creek mouths, or they may raft right in the main channel if the current is slight.\r\nBut we don''t have water freezing conditions at any river; Ducks are migrating here for the open hot waters (less cold).  So, European or American Duck shooting techniques are not so fruitful here, (other than calling and camouflaging methods)\r\n\r\nHOW CAN BE GOOD DUCK SHOOT AT LATE MOON SOON\r\nAlmost every year; we are facing flood situations at our rivers in Pakistan, in the flood history we have main floods at our River in the almost in the September. And the same time is for the ducks migration, so always plan your duck shoot at late moon soon according to the soil and river patterns at your country. \r\n\r\nDuck shoot at rivers is a two-step process. First, you must locate the ducks.  Then you must set up precisely where they want to be. In so doing, your decoys must look natural and your boat and hunters totally concealed from discerning eyes in the sky above.\r\n\r\nA few ducks always hang around rivers, which are natural loafing and feeding spots. However, two special times are far and away the best for running rivers. Hunters should be alert for these conditions and take advantage of them when they occur.\r\n\r\nYou should keep a constant check on river levels as the hunting season progresses. Levels and flood stages on big rivers through available sources of information and news updates. \r\nDuck shooting at late MOON SOON is typically best when rising water first starts breaking into riverside creeks and fields. \r\nDucks are always scared from fast and high waves of water. When a river surges above flood stage, be there the next morning. One day&#8217;s delay might cause you to miss one of the best shoot of your life.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF BEST SHOOTING SPOT\r\nBetter you scout the area first or avail the services of your trustworthy local guide. Then simply cover water as possible for you and watch for birds. Don''t stop and set up before you find a concentration. \r\n\r\nWhen you see working ducks or flush a large flight off the water, move in and set up exactly where they were. They like that spot for a reason.\r\nThen it&#8217;s a matter of selection of spot to hide the boat/jeep, and to setting up your hide and waiting.  For best shooting hide and camouflaging always add native vegetation to the blind for a more natural appearance, also for the camouflaging of your boat/jeep. (always park your jeep far away from your shooting spot).', ''),

Just saying . Buy ammo from the money u saved, and practice shooting.\r\n\r\nUnlike a friend of mine who went outa his way to buy a pricy weapon , and then keeps worrying abt all the ways he cant stop it from getting scratched and what not, defeats the whole purpose.  \r\n\r\nKnow your budget, Know the purpose of your purchase and don''t over think it .....and practice :D \r\nbest wishes , stay safe.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nNice post Salman brother, i already own a zastava tt and am quite happy with its performance but its too large for carry purposes. You are right about the saving money for ammo and target shooting but the thing is you can buy ammo from every thousand rupees that you save but you cant buy a good gun with that small amount of saving so it would be better for me to buy something good after saving this much ( i.e around 70k) and then keep buying ammo with what ever little i save because ammo can be bought in what ever amount but the gun cant be bought in pieces :P \r\nOnce again thanks for such a nice post :D', ''),

Hunters should be alert for these conditions and take advantage of them when they occur.\n\nYou should keep a constant check on river levels as the hunting season progresses. Levels and flood stages on big rivers through available sources of information and news updates. \nDuck shooting at late MOON SOON is typically best when rising water first starts breaking into riverside creeks and fields. \nDucks are always scared from fast and high waves of water. When a river surges above flood stage, be there the next morning. One day’s delay might cause you to miss one of the best shoot of your life.\n\nSELECTION OF BEST SHOOTING SPOT\nBetter you scout the area first or avail the services of your trustworthy local guide. Then simply cover water as possible for you and watch for birds. Don''t stop and set up before you find a concentration. \n\nWhen you see working ducks or flush a large flight off the water, move in and set up exactly where they were. They like that spot for a reason.\nThen it’s a matter of selection of spot to hide the boat/jeep, and to setting up your hide and waiting.  For best shooting hide and camouflaging always add native vegetation to the blind for a more natural appearance, also for the camouflaging of your boat/jeep. (always park your jeep far away from your shooting spot).[/QUOTE]\n \nbrother i agree with you but here are some pockets where it can be hunted like USA. here are some pockets where are a lot of mallards,pintail,teal,whistling teal,shovler, etc which you cant imagine.the people who have hgh approach they enjoy the hunting in these pockets. \ni am saying this because i have played hunted at these areas.', ''),

(360494, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;199103]AoA Bro, i''m truly impressed by your talent. you indeed are an experienced hunter because barrels of a side by side shotgun are usually regulated at 30-40 yards. meaning no person on this planet can simply sight in such a barrel and shoot a slug at 100 yards (law of physics working here). in order to take an accurate shot at 100 yards in this setup one must compensate as both barrels are actually converging to a known distance. that compensation I believe is nothing short of pure skill.\n\non top of that, there is no rear sight on your side by side shotgun. so, a shooter must sight-in with nothing as reference and take aim (with slug) with nothing more than pure guess work. thats experience my friend. keep it up bro. I''m truly impressed.\n\n@skeeter60 Sb.\n\nSir I would appreciate if you could explain as to why an ordinary hunter shooting a slug would even miss the broad side of a barn at 40 yards with a double barrel side by side shotgun and no rear sight and what/how can one compensate if the situation ever calls for it.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n \n\n  @ 12 gauge ... bravo bravo ... nice information .... \n\n      plz throw some light on barrel regulation of over n under Baikal IZH-27 fixed choke DT model 28" barrel.

As I know personally Masroor is very good shooter, seasoned hunter.  \r\nI know to him since 1988, he is senior hunter. \r\nMay you don''t believe that many times we have many mutual conflicts on hunting issues with PG and non PG hunters, but we never advertise here and never did try to shelter the respect of any junior or senior. We all are here with very clear and positive mind sets. \r\n\r\nBrother may you don''t know that; every hunter of the PG is in the close hunting network like a exemplary & good family. I request to the all members of the other forums , '' follow on the symbolic mutual respect, love and care of the PG members'', PAKGUNS.COM really proving itself PAK FAMILY.\r\n\r\nEvery body at PG is giving respect to each-other above the provincial, religious, tribal, departmental and families priorities and profiles. I request to every one including you, think like a single but good family, if we will think like that than why we will not give respect to each-other with his due respect as junior & senior. Share positive stop abuses. \r\n\r\nAlready through previous posts brother HUNTER1 has been addressed that, ''some time text is not sufficient to express positively according to the mind set of writers. \r\nDenovo87 already defined you well,'' after long stay and hundreds of posts we all know to each other very well, ''who is who''.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nTR brother from where Masroor Gul came in this cyber war?', ''),

Or elsewhere near Lahore? \r\n\r\n@Sights mentioned Eley Alphamax as a very superior cartridge, no doubt about Eley UK but I have found these Victory (Cyprus) to be equally superior too. Cyprus is sure coming out with some great 12g ammo.\r\n\r\nThese are some very good Victory brand CYPRUS made cartridges for hunting, especially the last one ''V1 Sonic'' I found to be a great performer at ducks, though marked competition load and 28 gms, the extended head (probably 16mm) in #8 load with low recoil threw great patterns. I am still in search for them, though have not found them in stocks anywhere. I have found that with an open choke (like Imp Cyl) and this combination of longer steel head 16mm (i.e. higher velocity such 1510 fps of ''V1 Sonic''), they perform great in field, definitely better than Shaheen:\r\n\r\n1) FIELD purpose - ''Victory'' - 70mm - 1485 fps - 35g - #6,7,7½,8,9 - Plastic\r\n2) FIELD purpose - ''Europa'' - 70mm - 1420 fps - 32g - #6,7,7½,8,9 - Plastic\r\n3) COMP purpose - ''V1 Sonic'' - 70mm - 1510 fps - 28g - #7½,8,9 - Plastic\r\n[* All three are different models mnfc by same company [url]www.victorycom.com[/url] under brand VICTORY]\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is POF Wah Industries 12 bore cartridgess chart; especially of notice is the comparison of them with above Victory (Cyprus) or Olympia (Cyprus) at [url]www.olympia.com.cy[/url] and Eley Hawk Ltd (UK) at [url]www.eleyhawkltd.com[/url] ... with respect to head length in mm, load in grams, length of shell (mm) ... these variables should be studied too and it then gives a fair picture of their performance, though actual performance can only be verified in field, thats a given fact.  \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee387/Francolino/12borecartidges.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOne thing is evident in b/w Shaheen cartridges (as per statistical info of charts) that the velocity of even a Shaheen Super (any pellet size) is 340 m/s, i.e. 1115 fps, which when compared to above for example Cyprus make Victory falls short by 400 fps (feet per second) in case of V1 Sonic that is 1510 fps. The head length is same 16mm, but cartridge length is 58mm (Shaheen) vs 70mm (Cyprus). So those variables do make their mark, especially in high velocity cartridges and hence patterns. Especially now the prices (in mkt) of imported brands and Shaheen high velocity (Super, with 16mm head) are almost equal, so why get Shaheen Super?? Regular ones like #8 Shaheen are great upland performers but it is heard that in the last few years, the variance has increased so much that carton to carton it has started varying.. I may be wrong but that is the feedback I got, and experienced few times too. \r\n\r\nSo ... any info about above 3 variants of Victory cartridges (Cyprus made) will be welcome from members.

Unfortunately or fortunately, this is commercialization age now, and, we in general also go by what is readily available at hand. Personally, I would not hesitate a minute to buy a good classic SxS (new or mint condition only) and leave all modern day guns. But problem is, immaculate condition classic SxS guns are not available with ease these days; even if they are, prices are shooting off the roof. \r\n\r\nTalking about your main point, barrels of these classics SxS''s for example which have fixed chokes, slowly taper from chamber to muzzle-end, thus giving a fine choking effect ALL the way (e.g. 1/4 & 1/2 ... or 1/4 & 3/4 ... both popular hunting choke combinations). That is not only realllly expensive to mnfc, it gives a much better patterning result, as per my humble knowledge. The elongated cones now being used in Brownings and Berettas (overbored, flush types) are trying to bring that gradual choking effect in their guns, even adding a one-inch PARALLEL extended part out of barrel to ''stabilize'' pellets before exiting. But as you can see, it cannot be compared to the classics whose barrels taper ALL the way entire length of barrel, thus making the pellets as even in distribution at impact point on target. Due to highly expensive mnfc now, the gun industry of UK & Europe is thus shrinking rapidly and they are only making high end guns for filthy rich there or around world. Those who own such classics here in mint condition (mostly passed by there elders as legacy) I consider them really lucky.\r\n\r\nSo...you and me are on same wave length as far as barrels and chokes are concerned. And pls do give any further feedback about patterning differences between A400 Xplor Unico & AL391 Urika2 (both optimachoke Plus) whenever you have some further experience or feedback.

(360740, ' Very nice buy @Anthrax.\r\n\r\nActually I also am quite fond of LED LONG RANGE flashlights, and have a few Chinese ones from local market. Rs500-1200 with Rs1200 being spot to flood type with 3AAA cell usage and fairly long range (about 150 yards). But I am looking for a high end LED flashlight by Surefire or Streamlight or Fenix (yours is definitely a fantastic model). Other two brands/models which fancy me as a value buy are: "Nebo Redline Tactical Flashlight" (220 Lumen, #5581, retail $26 only) at [url]www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/hi/2445457011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_hi_1_4_last[/url] OR [url]www.amazon.com/Nebo-Redline-Tactical-Flashlight-Strobe/dp/B0049M8I22/ref=zg_bs_2445457011_1[/url]. And Maglite XL100 with spot-to-flood feature and 138m max range (retail $31) at [url]www.maglite.com/maglite_xl100_led.asp[/url]. By FENIX, 3 other good long-range outdoor & hunting LED flashlights by Fenix are:\r\n\r\nFenix TK15 Tactical LED Flashlight:\r\n[url]http://www.fenixlighting.com/flashlights/fenix_tk15_led_flashlight.html[/url]\r\n\r\nFenix TK35 Tactical LED Flashlight:\r\n[url]http://www.fenixlighting.com/flashlights/fenix_tk35_led_flashlight.html[/url]\r\n\r\nFenix LD20 LED Flashlight:\r\n[url]http://www.fenixlighting.com/flashlights/fenix_ld20_led_flashlight.html[/url]\r\n\r\nOne main characteristic in all above including yours (LD-40) is ability to use different colored filters with them - RED, GREEN and BLUE, as these are helpful in outdoors especially hunting ducks and big game. And GREEN filter is especially my favorite. Red and green ones are much LESS bothersome and less visible to birds & big game, and hence promote STEALTH, and red filter keeps one''s low profile when travelling in dark to set blinds or anything; there can be many uses. Plus, the camp light accessory is a great add-on. TK-15 and TK-35 by Fenix have been given special reviews by outdoorsmen and journals.\r\n\r\nIs it known where these Fenix and Surefire lights are being mnfc???

(360763, ' [QUOTE=vizzurd;199467]I thank you all for your comments and guidance. It really helped me clear my mind. However, I did go ahead with the swap and yesterday got the Stoeger Couger 8000. I am starting to like this weapon and read some very nice things about it. It is much better in terms of CC but I don&#8217;t know much about its reliability. \r\n\r\nSo far as Viking is concerned it surely must be a superior weapon but it was too large for someone who has to carry it all the time. Now please say some nice things about Stoeger Cougar so I don&#8217;t swap it again for something like&#8230;.may be some Chinese or even worse Darra made weapon&#8230;LOL\r\n\r\nAnyway thank you again.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n[B][I]Vizzurd[/I][/B] brother I am not a Stoeger Cougar basher.. in fact I carried it myself for atleast one year & was quite satisfied with its performance (did used it as a routine carry gun so can''t comments on its durability) untill I switched over to Glock19 for carry purpose and swapped the Stoeger with CZ 75B because I did,nt have a spare MOI & i needed that 75B very badly.\r\n\r\nNow coming towards the durability department Baikal MP446 Viking wins hands down.. just look at the breech of the barrel and you will realise yourself that this handgun is made to take some torture.. Russian guns are offcourse not that fancy looking as Turkish weapons, are rough & tough and are ugly looking.. the finish is crude as well but when it comes to function they are renowned for it.. just look at their AK47s, their TTs and thier Makarovs.. did you ever hear of an AK47 malfunctioning.. same is true for Russian TTs and Makarovs.\r\n\r\nTherefore I will request you not to compare Viking with Stoeger because Viking is by far a superior handgun than Stoeger Cougar but the only drawback is that its cannot be used as a conceal carry while Stoeger as such is also not for conceal carry, but atleast carrying it is better than Viking IMHO.\r\n\r\nNow I hope you understand my point.\r\n\r\nRegards', ''),

Briefly giving you some backgrd ……I started off hunting independently with a friend and a cousin using a locally made Sikander single barrel at age 15 about 22-23 years back from now (though with elders I had started shotgunning at age 9-10 under parental supervision) which I used to borrow from a local as I didn’t have a licence and did all sorts of khawaris incl some nice duck hunts too. Then at age 18, I had a licence and started with a Browning 27” brl SxS (bought NIB then at Rs30-35K) and a long chassis Suzuki soft top (again independent hunting with some friends and cousins), then switched to a repeater semi auto Remington 1100 with 28” barrel with which I won two skeet championships, and few years later switched to Ber A303 and Ber AL391 Teknys both which I still use on reg basis.

The best balanced weapon among above ones was Apollo O/U (if you would believe me) for my physique and I just loved the gun when I bought it,,,but,,,,but,,,,when I started partridge with it, I could just not hit it, just couldn’t. My average dropped from 7-8 birds per 10 shots to 2-3 max per 10 shots with it. And that happened consistently for some time till I literally disposed off the gun and heaved a sigh of relief.

(360841, ' Thanks boys for your feedback, advises and suggestions. Today, me along with Panther went to the LS market to buy a simple 9mm cleaning kit which at max would take us 30 mins or so I imagined. At first we stopped at the store to check out a comprehensive kit later to discover that the suitability on the kit itself and the box contradicted themselves. We moved on to find a 9mm kit with everything one would want except the 9mm brushes !! The copper brushes either were too big or too small. We then stopped at a small store where the guy made his own kits like local brushes with beretta oil etc and was charging 4 grand for a 1200 rupees kit. The journey started at 2 and it was now 3. I finally decided to get the local cleaning kit which my brother Panther bought a couple of weeks earlier. While finally inspecting the kit I discovered that there was no patch holder available !! No sir it had to be a complete kit, so we went forward on foot and came across a shop which agreed to sell all the items in a 9mm kit individually. The patch holder rod was made of plastic and was orange in colour. I thought to myself that 50 to 100 bucks and I shall get this thing and then buy the incomplete kit which now will be complete,  which I saw earlier. \r\n\r\nThe butcher was demanded 200 frekkin rupees for plastic junk !!! We were so tired and frustrated now that we told him to F off and then went back to the store to FINALLY buy my incomplete kit without the patch holder. Sweet 2 hours and we were finally done.\r\n\r\nSo you see lads, this passion / hobby is getting the best of me or as my brother Panther puts it, something is wrong with your shopping journies Lolzzzzz', ''),

Can any of you provide me contact number/email who can help me getting my first license? i called in MOI office a lot but no body is willing to take responsibility.\n2. Now what about the  gun i purchased? I know i can''t have ammos for that but is it legal to keep it having photocopies of original docs only? Or shall i get rid of it.\n3. Is it legal by any means?\n\n2nd story\n1. I had to go abroad for 8 months, after getting provincial license do i have to approve it from somewhere? register it? renew it etc? somebody told me to get tickets for it, what kinda tickets? i went GPO they said you''ll find them from(sorry forgot, but somewhere near Mina-e-Pakistan)\n2. i didn''t buy any gun for it yet, do i have to do any procedure before that, and what if i still don''t want to buy a gun for couple of months, do i have to extend date etc? suppose that date''s been passed so is the license still valid? \n3. For the time being can i transfer my first gun on provincial license?(the gun that i purchased but license''s not been issued)\n\nWell don''t get me wrong, the reason for asking a contact number is not to get my license in some illegal way, i believe my family has strong contacts who can get me license in days and this is what my uncles do, they get all PB licenses in days, but i am a kind of person not believing in references. Thats why i never asked anyone to get me that license or make new one for me.

I enjoyed reading it definitely; you might too.\r\n\r\nYes the regular gun in use definitely does make you shoot with ease and effectively; major reason being gun&#8217;s fit by that time has become accustomed to your body by regular shooting. But... the Apollo incident was not a cause of not having been familiar enough with it. Despite one year usage, it still had erratic patterns; I think one year is pretty ok a period to get used to a gun, though I was not using it as a full time gun. Conclusion: Some guns do certainly have sub-standard barrel mnfc and craft, and hence they give bad results or patterns becoz shotgun barrel mnfc & &#8216;choking&#8217; it with precision and longevity, is especially a very high tech job.', ''),

Then at age 18, I had a licence and started with a Browning 27&#8221; brl SxS (bought NIB then at Rs30-35K) and a long chassis Suzuki soft top (again independent hunting with some friends and cousins), then switched to a repeater semi auto Remington 1100 with 28&#8221; barrel with which I won two skeet championships, and few years later switched to Ber A303 and Ber AL391 Teknys both which I still use on reg basis. In between, I experimented with Apollo O/U 28&#8221; barrel Turkish for a year as a backup shikaar gun & Sarsilmaz 28&#8221; semiauto again as a backup for another 6 months, and my experience was &#8230; .\n\nThe gun did matter sir &#8230;.. not only the man behind the gun &#8230; not only the balance even. The best balanced weapon among above ones was Apollo O/U (if you would believe me) for my physique and I just loved the gun when I bought it,,,but,,,,but,,,,when I started partridge with it, I could just not hit it, just couldn&#8217;t. My average dropped from 7-8 birds per 10 shots to 2-3 max per 10 shots with it. And that happened consistently for some time till I literally disposed off the gun and heaved a sigh of relief. The balance was no match to any other gun I had owned/used, but it was pathetic with patterning where no pattern centered, none went uniform consistently. So, gun technology and metallurgy and craftsmanship, barrel mnfc quality and of course after all those features are aligned, then handling is a must. Handling is nothing but proper weight distribution of gun (according your own physique), cast, pull, drop mainly. But,,,,, as I am a bit tech-conscious person &#61514; , you might judge it from [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?6297-Fenix-Tactical-LD-40-HIGH-PERFORMANCE-FLASHLIGHT-Review%21&p=199458&highlight=#post199458"]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?6297-Fenix-Tactical-LD-40-HIGH-PERFORMANCE-FLASHLIGHT-Review!&p=199458&highlight=#post199458[/URL] (post 37) and [URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?2743-The-Ammunition-Report-for-12-Gauge-%28ShotGuns%29&p=199451&highlight=#post199451"]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?2743-The-Ammunition-Report-for-12-Gauge-(ShotGuns)&p=199451&highlight=#post199451[/URL] (post 152), I would give foremost priority to tech side of the gun first.

(361015, 'Hunter''s types and stages of evolution Two recent but very different studies give us an insight to those of us who enjoy the sport of hunting.  Can you find yourself in one of them? \r\n\r\nThe Three Types of Hunters \r\n\r\nYale professor Dr Stephen Kellert, in a study of US hunters and their attitudes and characteristics, found that most hunters in North America today fall into one of three categories that he listed as \r\n\r\n”Utilitarian/Meat Hunters.  (43.8%) \r\n”Nature Hunters.  (17.7%) \r\n”Sport Hunters.  (38.5%)" \r\nThe sport-hunters group is the one that the nonhunting and antihunting public particularly dislikes and often uses to stereotype or negatively portray all hunters and hunting.  Let''s take a look at Dr Kellert''s categories. \r\n\r\n”Utilitarian/Meat Hunters \r\n\r\n"Hunting to obtain meat was the most frequently cited primary reason, accounting for 43.8 percent of persons who hunted ... Utilitarian/meat hunters were significantly more likely to have been raised or presently living in rural, open-country areas.  Utilitarian/meat hunters also reported much greater experience with raising animals for either slaughter or non-slaughter purposes, and had fathers employed in farm-related occupations.  This hunting group includes a disproportionate number of persons over 65 years of age and significantly more respondents earning less than $6,000. \r\n\r\n"Utilitarian/meat hunters appear to perceive animals largely from the perspective of their practical usefulness ... The utilitarian/meat hunter views hunting as a harvesting activity and wild animals as a harvestable crop not unlike other renewable natural resources." \r\n\r\n”Nature Hunters \r\n\r\n"Hunting for the purpose of close contact with nature was the [least often] cited primary reason for hunting, accounting for some 17.7 percent of those who hunted ... Demographically, nature hunters included significantly more persons under 30 years of age and far fewer over 65.  These age characteristics may suggest possible trends in motivation for hunting.  Nature hunters were also of higher socioeconomic status, as indicated by more college-educated respondents and more fathers employed in professional and business executive occupations. \r\n\r\n"Nature hunters reported by far the most adult and childhood wildlife interest, more backpacking and camping-out experience, and more bird-watching activity.  Importantly, nature hunters had far higher knowledge-of-animals scale scores particularly in comparison to sport hunters. \r\n\r\n"[Nature hunters also] ... indicated strong concern and affection for all animals ... [However this affection is] ... somewhat generalized and not specifically directed at pet animals or manifest in the feeling of ‘loving’ animals.  The desire for an active, participatory role in nature was perhaps the most significant aspect of the nature hunter''s approach to hunting.  The goal was the intense involvement with wild animals in their natural habitats.  Participation as a predator was valued for the opportunities it provided to regard oneself as an integral part of nature.  The hunt was appreciated for its forcing of awareness of natural phenomena organized into a coherent, goal-directed framework." \r\n\r\n”Sport Hunters \r\n\r\n"Sport hunters constitute 38.5 percent of all those who hunted ... They were significantly more likely to reside in cities, and to have been in the armed forces.  Additionally, they differed from utilitarian/meat hunters in reporting far less experience raising animals for a product, and from nature hunters in reporting significantly less backpacking and bird watching activities.  One outstanding characteristic was their low scores on the knowledge-of-animals scale.  Interestingly, only anti-hunters, of all animal activity groups studied, had equally low knowledge scores. \r\n\r\n"It appeared that competition and mastery over animals, in the context of a sporting contest, were the most salient aspects of the sport hunter''s interest in the hunting activity.  This group did not reveal strong affections for animals. \r\n\r\n"The hunted animal was valued largely for the opportunities it provided to engage in a sporting activity involving mastery, competition, shooting skill and expressions of prowess.  They were not items of food but trophies, something to get and display to fellow hunters.  For the sport hunter, hunting was appreciated more as a human social than as an animal-oriented activity." \r\n\r\nThe Five Stages of Evolution of a Sport Hunter \r\n\r\nAs with all things in life, a hunter''s perspective of his sport changes as time goes by.  According to the Hunter''s Education manual used by the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, the five stages of a hunter''s life are (a) the Shooter Stage, (b) the Limiting-Out stage, (c) the Trophy stage, (d) the Method stage, and (e) the Sportsman stage. \r\n\r\nAs the sport of hunting itself changes through the years, so do the factors that determine what "successful hunting" is.  Add to this the changes that take place in each hunter''s life, and things can get a bit confusing.  Some of the factors that can determine or influence what kinds of hunters we become are (a) the hunter''s age, (b) his hunting companions, (c) his role models, (d) his personal ethics, and (e) his and years of hunting experience.  All of these affect our ideas of "success."  Where a hunter fits into one of the five groups may change as he progresses in his hunting career.  What stage are you in now?  What stage would you like to be in? \r\n\r\nThe Shooter Stage \r\n\r\nA hunter who is in the Shooter Stage talks about satisfaction with hunting being closely tied to being able to "get-in some shooting."  The beginning duck hunter says that he had an excellent day if he got-in a lot of shooting.  The beginning deer hunter talks about the number of shooting opportunities.  Missing game means little to hunters in this phase.  A beginning hunter wants to pull the trigger and test the capability of his firearm.  A hunter in this stage may be a dangerous hunting partner. \r\n\r\nThe Limiting-Out Stage \r\n\r\nA hunter who is in the Limiting-Out Stage still talks about the satisfaction of shooting.  But what seems more important to him is measuring success through the killing of game and the number of birds or animals that he has shot.  Limiting-out or filling a tag is his absolute measure of success.  Do not let your desire to limit-out be stronger than your concern for safe behavior at all times. \r\n\r\nThe Trophy Stage \r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of a hunter in the Trophy stage is determined by the selectivity of game.  A duck hunter might take only greenheads.  A deer hunter looks for one special deer.  A hunter might travel far to find a real trophy animal.  Shooting opportunity and skills become less important than finding and shooting the coveted trophy. \r\n\r\nThe Method Stage \r\n\r\nWhen a hunter has reached the Method Stage, he has accumulated all the special equipment that he could conceivably need.  Hunting has become one of the most important things in his life.  His satisfaction comes from the method that enables him to take game.  Taking game is important but secondary to how he takes it.  This hunter studies long and hard how best to pick a blind site, how to lay-out decoys, and how to call-in waterfowl.  A deer hunter goes one-on- one with a white-tail deer — studying sign, tracking, and the life habits of the deer.  This hunter often handicaps himself intentionally by hunting only with black-powder firearms or bow and arrow.  Bagging game, or limiting, still is a necessary part of the hunt during this phase. \r\n\r\nThe Sportsman Stage \r\n\r\nFinally, as a hunter ages and after many years of hunting, he tends to "mellow out."  He now finds satisfaction in the total hunting experience.  Being in the field, enjoying the company of friends and family, and seeing nature outweigh the need for taking game. \r\n\r\nNot all sport hunters go through all these stages, or go through them in this particular order.  It is also possible for hunters who pursue several species of game to be in a different stage with regard to each species that he hunts.  Some hunters feel that role models of good sportsmen, training, or reading books or magazines helped them pass more quickly through some of these stages. \r\n\r\nThere you have it, two studies with two very different ways of looking at hunters and how we approach our sport.  Does one of these categories describe you?  Where are you in your hunting career now?  Where would you like to be?  Each of us has to decide for himself what kind of hunter he wants to be, and to be the best hunter that he can be.', ''),

(360979, 'Mossberg 835 Ultimag Riffled Barrel vs Federal Riffled Slugs Was reading a lot about the slugs, their accurate range, slug guns/barrels etc a lot at forum these days. So decided to pop the cherry of Mossberg 835 Ultimag''s riffled barrel, although bought this gun about 15 years back but never tried slugs and riffled barrel.\n   \n  Been discussing with 12guage bro about the accuracy of Riffled slugs in riffled barrels as generally a riffled slug is considered more accurate when fired through smooth bore and for riffled barrels a sabot slug is advised for better accuracy. So we decided to give a try to everything riffled (slug & barrel) .\n   \n  Went to range this afternoon with gun, Federal Classic Riffled Slugs, Leupold range finder, targets and  target stand.\n   \n  It was very humid in the afternoon but no wind, set target and fired an LG/SG cartridge from 20 meters just to have an idea of the iron sight but to my surprise all the 9 (or 8) balls didn''t touched even the back stop ;)  its the magic of riffled barrel that I am sure spun the pallets so badly all went over the back stop, that was a dangerous thing the gun did :suspicious:\n\n  So decided to try slug at 20 meters to start with as I didn''t want to take risk of it flying over the back stop and landing somewhere in the city, also didn''t have any idea of the iron sight this barrel has.\n   \n  Was quite shaking at first slug,   reason; one & only 12guage bro; who advised to wear safety helmet, gloves & what ever safety wear I can arrange before firing first slug :nono:  I was so shaky that after firing the slug from 20 mtrs didn''t find the slug hole in the target board ;) but as soon as reached to target board it was a big hole cutting 9 & 8 ring separator at 12 o clock.\n   \n  First shot gave me lot of encouragement that 50 meter shot was right in the bull :peace:  although from 50 meters it was very difficult for a novice like me to use iron sight & keep the front sight right on the middle but I did it and this shot will keep me boozy for weeks.\n   \n  Third shot was from 80 meters (as that is the maximum distance I could use at range), let me admit that at this distance one need hell of a practice on iron sights, I was sweating so badly that had to break the stance thrice (to wipe the eyes clean) before pulling the trigger that in sitting position too. This shot landed at 7 o clock in circle 3 and I was so happy to put the slug at least on the paper as I was not expecting it even to hit the target chart due to stress I experienced to aligning the sights with target that was looking of the same size of front sight.\n   \n   \n  Below is pictorial of this whole episode, will add other details in subsequent posts.\n\n\n\n\n[B]The Gun[/B]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/TheGun.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[B]The slug[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/Slug.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/Slugpack.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]All Tools[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/Rangetools.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]At 50 Meters[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/at50meters.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]At 80 Meters[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/at80meters.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Gun Sight[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/RearSight.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[B]Muzzle after 3 Slugs & 1 SG/LG shots[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/Muzzle.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/Muzzle2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[B]And The Target[/B]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Shotgun%20Slug%20Session%2017-7-11/Target3.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(361028, ' AoA Denovo87 Bhai.\r\n\r\nGreat shooting sir. you have outdone yourself with this one. really accurate shooting at 50 meters I must say. keep it up. from the group I can see that this gun can be used to accuracy take down any game of choice at 100 yards. at 50 its a confirm kill. at 100, you need to work a little in getting the bullet/slug drop right. it could be the limitation of the sights as well. I can bet if you put a scope on it, you''ll get even better results.\r\n\r\nabout the picture of the muzzle. one can clearly see the damage done by firing a soft lead projectile through a rifled barrel by looking at the leading inside the bore. a quick tip: apply some lead remover on a scotch-brite pad fixed on a cleaning rod. then apply lots of elbow grease. the barrel will come out shiny as new.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I was novice at that time and first i fired without my father permission out of a single barell Russian IZH-18 30 " full choke 15 years back. Later i tried the same slugs in same gun 3 years back but distance was 15 meters only. i must make it clear that nothing happened with our full choke gun. Russian chrome lined barrels are great. Yes the same slug ruined a 24 inches barrel of a fellow hunter. A nice bubble 2" b4 muzzle.\n\n2- Federal as mentioned above at 55 yards from my over n under gun. I used Modified choke ... the result was really good. \n\n3- Rottwile slug from the same modified choke 55 yards ..28 '' barrel. result was superb and i used the under barrel only. \n\n  Now im short of slugs  ..... So its my first preference to get them from market and try at 70 yards on marked target. This time i wd use 2 double barrel guns .... SxS and O/u. both M chokes . Lets see i wd share piks this time as previously i dont have any. \n\n  As soon as i get some from market i wd try and post ... actually i cdnt try them due to shortage in market as well so i posted the question. \n\n  let me clear a concept here \n\n   Modern rifle slugs in smooth bores are qualified for Full chokes as well on 50 yards...... its not my perception but specially advertised by manufacturers ... specially Rottwile .... plz chek their web sight ..... its mentioned\n\n[URL]http://www.brenneke-munition.de/cms/classic.html?&L=1[/URL]\n\nWhy im insisting 70 yards ...cuz a forster slug[Federal rifled slug] loses most of his power at 100 yards ... but brennek doesn''t.

(363502, ' [FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]@ P-F Sir, [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]Wa Alikum Aslam[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]Undoubtedly, I stood behind my each word you quoted. Since, you have stopped HUNTER1 that this topic is regarding game animal, so it deviates whatever I had meant for at that moment (You have quoted). I was talking specifically about game birds. Yes, it&#8217;s a cruelness to kill sitters. [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]Here in (Pakistan) scenario has utterly changed now. The times when you and your father were hunting deer&#8217;s at wildlife permits in Bhawalpur was golden days but at present ground reality has poles apart. Miniscule percentage of hunter is available here which bothers to carries any permission or legal permit for any trophy hunting. [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]While you have taken me to hornets nest, I would dare to say 99.99 % of the big game is being hunted illegally by various means in Pakistan. The permits available are very expensive and beyond the reach of even richest people, which is certainly another failure of our policies by WLD.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]Anyhow, coming back to your query regarding killing animals with [B]deception is a foul play[/B]. I would just add my comments that we will appreciate if kindly folks here should atleast avoid killing females from now onward. This will be a considered most ethical and greatest favor for the wildlife. [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]@P-F [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]Please hope you will not mind sir, the level of ethical hunting you have demanded is miles away from us, even impracticable in any part of world. You are talking ultimate echelon, which is indeed impossible according to ground realities that the animal should warn first &#8230;&#8230;.. Then what &#8230;&#8230;. The animal will become SULTAN RAHI, standing same place and dodging bullets or catching them with teeth and spiting???? [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]Or [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]A hunter should start his expedition after some aerial firing after reaching animal &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. How &#8230;&#8230;..(By foot, beat, jeep, helicopter) bla bla bla &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]The terrains really available here, where all this is practically possible like Salt range, Humaliya&#8217;s, dhabiji, Astor, Etc.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]With due apologies and all regards there are still many game animals available near your area where you have spent you early life i.e. Bhawalpur. This is the area which is adjacent to CHOLISTAN Desert. Your query seems practical to some percent there. Folks can follow game animals by jeeps after warning them etc. etc. (Which is also not handy too, now days because time has gone for relaxed big game hunting).[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]What kind of the challenge you want to put amongst animal and the hunter? I am still not sure sir.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]This was the reason I have asked about the revision of your query. [/SIZE][/FONT]', ''),

Any other way would damage the muzzle crown ruining accuracy.\nThe first chamber of the compensater also gets a lot of lead from the exposed base of the FMJ bullets clean and liberally lube with break free or good oil to prevent corrosion and rusting under the lead deposit.\nGrease the slide rails and the pistol is a delight to shoot.\nWhen using lead solvents make sure you AVOID contact with skin; as the skin will absorb the deadly lead with the help of the solvent. \nWash hands vigorously after cleaning any fire arm.

The usual norm is that one should pattern the gun at the distance most commonly or the USUAL maximum encountered in field. \r\n\r\nBut not forgetting to thank you again for your tremendous help in guiding us with the new (GREAT) gun''s patterning! After all, patterning is a key essential of shotgunning, especially for field. May I ask you a qs: How much are you into clay shooting (skeet and trap) AND field shooting (hunting gamebirds)? We normally consider 30 yards patterning distance for partridge/quail and 35 yards for waterfowl (ducks/geese). But using #4 and #8 for BOTH distances, it would be a bit time-consuming, therefore for simplicity''s sake, I would recommend to go for 35 yards patterning range only, with both shells & with both chokes, as above mentioned. And, if you want to go a little further than that (which is certainly recommended), you can repeat the same at 30 yds. Total shots fired will be 8 and same no of charts (get simple brown paper ones). \r\n\r\nI can give you further more accurate details and hints on patterning arrangements if you want. But these charts once done will be helpful to you in future, so keep them, and add different shot loads chart results later as you check them; and do store them for reference and comparison between different cartridge brands.', ''),

Why is there a distinction in the mind of some members that Gun Enthusiast are not (or can never be) hunters. do they not know that some Gun Enthusiasts here on Pakguns hunt more then these "so called hunters"?\n\nI guess its the lack of vision that must be the case. these "so called hunter" only tend to see the world their way. insisting on "not learning" about their tools doesn''t make them "dedicated hunters". it only serves to make them unlearned.

(361559, 'Shams Shotgun Good evening All,\r\n\r\nI had gotten a shotgun license 2 months ago, and was initially looking to buy a used turkish pump action one as i do not have any experience with shotguns and thus i did not want to spend a lot on my first shotgun. Having spoken to a number of shotgun "gurus" i was advised to avoid buying a used one and go for a new "daudsons shooter". My basic purpose for the purchase was HD. \r\n\r\nFinally, i decided on going with daudsons and ventured into Saddar to pick one up from my dealer. I was told that the official dealer for this particular brand was Tayabally so i went to them. The gent told me that i can pick it up in the evening as they were getting a new stock and i agreed. Walking out i headed towards Balouchistan Arms to ask about a pistol a friend had earlier inquired from them. It was my first interaction with the owner of Balouchistan arms and i mentioned that i was picking up the "shooter" in the evening, he told me to forget that and go for "Shams pump action" and that it was a cheaper and a much better option. I informed him that i had never heard of the company and was told that it was owned by the elder brother of Daudsons and an earlier and more established brand and vowed by its reputation and robustness. \r\n\r\nBeing silent a few seconds i thought of being adventurous of buying a brand people hardly knew about, i decided to go for it and picked it up yesterday evening. He mentioned that it does not have the capability of firing slugs (i am unsure what they are as well as chokes)\r\n\r\nI will load some pictures tomorrow, i request our senior members to check this (you are most welcome to invite me to the range and fire it ) out and write a review on it so that people know about this brand as well since i was unable to find any reviews on it.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your feedback...\r\n\r\nThanks', ''),

Every hunter who started hunting 25-30 years ago (or before that) learned everything about hunting, gun safety, gun fit, shotgun swing, LOP, Cast, Cant, choke sizes, stance, follow through bla bla bla just in natural way and by watching/following elders but without even knowing this never ending terminology. These were/are the hunters who got chance to enjoy this beautiful sport to the extant that todays hunter not even can see these many birds/animals those were bagged by old hunters & old fixed choke, non-ejector, 30-32 inch barreled shotguns BUT again they never bothered about these technical things/terminology.\n\nNow where all this new terminology came from (among our local hunters), number one is internet like; decoys, calls etc... secondly introduction of sports shooting (skeet, trap etc) in our country like; follow through, stance, lead, LOP, cast, cant etc  third is purely commercial gimmicks like; choke tubes, different barrel lengths for different field types, shot loads etc.\n\nRemember only one thing; golden age of field hunting was totally free of modern day technical gun gimmicks.\n\nHope I made somethings more clear to you Apalo bro, just keep on asking and Inshallah will find me ready to offer my 2 cents.', ''),

(362243, ' @ Hamdan khan\n\nI would advise you not to put any type of oil "even if its silicon oil" into the compression chamber of a springer airgun. also when cleaning the barrel put a couple of drops and make sure you thoroughly clean the barrel with a patch and rod till no oil is left on the patch. For the exterior of the gun just moisten a rag or if you have silicon wipes just wipe it leaving only a thin coat of oil to keep rust off. The reason for not putting oil in the compression chamber and barrel is that when the piston is going to slam forward in order to propel the pellet it will come into contact with the oil and cause combustion better known as dieseling this will render your o-rings useless and leaving a thin coat of oil on the gun rather then a heavy coat will make it easier for you to cock the gun plus it will not cause swelling in the stock. as long as you follow these rules you can use any oil from the cheap 20rs sewing machine oil to the most expensive one available.\n\ncheers,', ''),

In fact, practice & practice AND exposure & more exposure is the simple key. Pursuing all three: (1) rifle shooting (2) field wingshooting & (3) clay shooting can be the most fun & gives you immense kick by providing "variety" with different forms of shooting. I have fair exposure to all three disciplines above which many hunters here do have too. Let me say that your Master Eye problem is a complex one, being right handed and being left eye dominant at same time. Now, the solution to this would be (in my opinion) to close LEFT EYE completely while shooting RIGHT HANDED. If you have a strong left eye dominance, then completely shut it, otherwise you can open it SLIGHTLY as per degree of left-eye domin .... Otherwise while shooting right-handed, if you open the left eye (say 30-5-%) with a strong left eye dominance, your shots will go off center towards RIGHT side. Now, what remedy will you have to restructure that problem? I think none. So best is to shoot with your right eye open (and left eye totally shut) in your natural right-handed shooting style.\r\n\r\nAs far as your wingshooting concerns, doing rifle and air-gun shooting predominantly as you said you do, will not make you handicapped at shotgunning flying targets, believe me. Start off with skeet shooting (it is a potent swing & posture training discipline) BUT unless you practice SIMULTANEOUSLY in field too, say with pigeons doves etc inititally, you won&#8217;t be able to reap the benefits at field with game birds. Then you would be stuck somewhere in the middle of another common misconception & debate that skeet or trap shooting limits one&#8217;s field shotgunning skills at game birds &#8230; because birds are random, and they are more of reflex shooting and so on and so forth the debate goes on. The world facts are that : Almost all top skeet or trap shooters were master wingshooters too. So, the condition is simple as I started out here: Merge both disciplines into your regular practice/sporting routine.', ''),

Because as Mian-50 bro and myself have shot quite regularly there at the older club in Lahore as pre-season gamebird practice and some competitive skeet-trap, but there is a point after which Skeet or Trap becomes monotonous due to redundancy which is not there in a sporting clay course. Either one sees shooters there who are into serious competitive game , or occassional hunters who want to practice swing and reflexes for gamebirds.  Skeet doubles indeed polish one''s ability to shoot quick at coveys in upland game (quail and partridge). On other hand Sporting Clay course has more variables, more variety, hence more interesting.

And helpful for all especially the people new to the great sport of wingshooting.\r\n\r\nI want to raise a few other questions to all members (including participants & silent readers who should come up with queries or suggesions too) regarding the best shooting style (swing methods) to hit ducks and partridge - the two major wingshooting sports here. And, how to take on these two fantastic birds. e.g. (1) How to and where to aim (how much lead) and hit an oncoming duck, coming towards you from front (2) Similarly sideways angled shots (3) Going away shots ...etc. The reason being many shooters (old and new alike) miss from certain angles which are their BAD ANGLES always. E.g. I have a bad shooting angle with on oncoming duck which is otherwise a very simple target, so for that I wait till the time they lift upwards from decoys and then I aim for their beaks. So how to correct that??\r\n\r\nSecond, the word is POKING - ''poking and hoping''. As, when you wait the concept of instinctive shooting is lost and deliberate shooting comes which is more of rifle shooting & airgun technique than instinctive shotgunning.', ''),

Any "Sight Picture"?[/QUOTE]\ni dont think that partridges can ever be wiped out from the salt ranges..this bird has got a magnificent quality by nature..it breeds app 2-3 times a year and every time 5-6 chicks survive which means that even a pair can do wonders in a land...it is only a matter of attension bye the game inspectors before the partridge population will again touch the horoizon!in some places of the salt ranges like sodhi,mardwal,nowshera(near khushab),katha and some areas of jehlum,i would want to laud the work of game officials...they are very serious about conserving hiran(deer)and at the same time,partridges and chukars r bieng conserved in those areas...this summer i went to my friend''s land near Sodhi,and believe me i saw 7-8 partridges at a time in a field at many places!i also saw game wardens one or 2 times on jeeps...however there are some areas,especially near pindadankhan and kallarkahar where partridges r bieng poached heavily and hunted with the help of game officials.here the partridge population is decreasing rapidly but now,3 months ago,the wardens of these areas were replaced with senior officials who really r strict and have imposed strict measures,like huge challans for illegal hunters...All in all partridge population ca be controoled at any time with the consent of game officials...\nThe areas we should be really worried about are the areas of the thal(near nurpur and qaidabad,district khushab)..6-7 years ago this area held noticable populations of both black and brown partridges..but now because of the use of bhagwa,vastness of the and ignorance of game officials,partridges cannot be found easily!', ''),

(362001, ' O Mian jee,\n\n\n  Writing book on cricket doesn&#8217;t means one will become sachin tandulkar. Likewise, shotgun shooting knowledge doesn&#8217;t means one will never miss or the ultimate shot. \n\n\n\n  Its practice and practice only but a lot also depends upon natural instinct. Some folks have natural tendency in shotgunning and I have seen few people shooting too good without any practice or gun experience. One of my abroad settled friend very rare to game but whenever he takes the guns he is marvelous.\n\n\n  @ Franclino Bro,\n\n\n  No need to go in details with you because you are a expert shooter without doubts now.\n\n\n  Just a suggestion as solution here:\n\n\n  1+2: Shift weight to rare feet while shooting a incoming bird passing over head and shot behind the barrel always. The more the distance more u needs a smooth and leading swing. This is my strongest area and I could managed to hit many time in a natural swing way that while pulling the trigger bird and barrel both were behind my head. \n\n\n\n  2+1 Twist barrels with the bird angle and feel the difference please. The excellent tip by my mentor for example the high incoming bird at right mat need to twist body falling right side, weight on rare foot and barrels tip (bead) following the target direction. You will enjoy the shot brother.\n\n\n  3: Away going bird needs a shift of weight to front foot and take the whole bird above barrel. The quick and speedy a bird is declining the increase in barrel and bird increase. The most dangerous shot if bird is on a rapid fall (For me).\n\n\n  Regarding poking I failed to understand your view point. What you want to say? Swing shooting is dependent to this very element but fix leading concept which is also not bad at high passing bird (35 mtr +) does allow pocking. However, we mostly go for birds within 40 yards range, its good at driven birds shoots mostly which is rare in our region (pheasants etc .) \n\n\n\n\n\n  Mian-50\n  Matchless tips to zain, I second your suggestions sir.', ''),

He denies any significant difference or none at all becasue of fact that the muzzle break of a shotgun is nowhere near to a rifle''s. In rifle, significant recoil reduction can be achieved he says. So, what do you say? I have not used a shotgun with ported choke or a ported barrel though, but I have used a cousin''s .30-06 Winchester SS Featherweight with polymer stock with ported barrel which did have some recoil reduction due to ported feature.\r\n\r\nRandy Wakeman...................\r\n"It may be trendy, or less so as time goes by, but as a generality porting does nothing remarkable as to function. It does irritate the shooters next to you, and puts more holes in what was a perfectly good barrel. There isn''t enough residual pressure at the port area in a shotgun to reasonably equate to a high-power rifle muzzle break, and the muzzle flip on a clays gun is nothing remotely like what you''ll find on a pistol.\r\n\r\nLess felt recoil can be found so much easier with a longer stock length, proper Limbsaver or Kick-Eez pad, and gun-fitting. No fixed breech gun of the same weight compares with the longer, broken-up recoil pulse of a gas operated gun. Sure, I''ve invested (wasted) my fair share on ported shotgun barrels. Perhaps the extra noise obfuscates the feeling of recoil, but if it offers anything substantial, my shoulder has not been able to detect it. Necessarily, on an Over / Under shotgun, ports cannot be placed where they would do the most good, as there is an upper barrel in the way. Since recoil is obviously of interest to so many folks, it is covered elsewhere on this web site."', ''),

He denies any significant difference or none at all becasue of fact that the muzzle break of a shotgun is nowhere near to a rifle''s. In rifle, significant recoil reduction can be achieved he says. So, what do you say? I have not used a shotgun with ported choke or a ported barrel though, but I have used a cousin''s .30-06 Winchester SS Featherweight with polymer stock with ported barrel which did have some recoil reduction due to ported feature.\r\n\r\nRandy Wakeman...................\r\n"It may be trendy, or less so as time goes by, but as a generality porting does nothing remarkable as to function. It does irritate the shooters next to you, and puts more holes in what was a perfectly good barrel. There isn''t enough residual pressure at the port area in a shotgun to reasonably equate to a high-power rifle muzzle break, and the muzzle flip on a clays gun is nothing remotely like what you''ll find on a pistol.\r\n\r\nLess felt recoil can be found so much easier with a longer stock length, proper Limbsaver or Kick-Eez pad, and gun-fitting. No fixed breech gun of the same weight compares with the longer, broken-up recoil pulse of a gas operated gun. Sure, I''ve invested (wasted) my fair share on ported shotgun barrels. Perhaps the extra noise obfuscates the feeling of recoil, but if it offers anything substantial, my shoulder has not been able to detect it. Necessarily, on an Over / Under shotgun, ports cannot be placed where they would do the most good, as there is an upper barrel in the way. Since recoil is obviously of interest to so many folks, it is covered elsewhere on this web site."[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nBro, first of all, when it comes to recoil, we are generally talking about recoil however what we usuall mean is the perceived recoil. and since its perceived, ofcourse it will differ from shooter to shooter. some shooters find that a ported shotgun does not offer any significant reduction in recoil whereas others swear by it.\r\n\r\nI have used shotgun with ported barrel and have always found that it reduces muzzle flip more than recoil (perceived). similarly I have always found that a limbsaver works better than anything out there in reducing perceived recoil whereas I know people who swear on kickeez when it comes to recoil reduction.\r\n\r\nso, in short, I guess it differs from person to person. but I''m sure porting has it benefits. it certainly looks cool though.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I''ll catch up in the discussion with it.\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=snowleopard;200905]can anyone please reply to this question for the sake of all junior''s knowledge?\r\nand secondly kindly define and differentiate between Churchill and stanbury styles?[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAm not familiar with Stanbury or Churchill terminology; however I just know there are mainly THREE styles/methods of shooting flying targets or birds; they would be commonly known to all regular or old shotgunners too. Here it is for sake of those who are relatively new to those disciplines:\r\n\r\n(1) Swing Thru Method:\r\nMove and Mount, coming from behind target/bird, following its line of path, fire just as you cross the target, maintaining your swing (follow thru) and of course without lifting head/cheek till follow thru is complete.\r\n\r\n(2) Point & Swing Method:\r\nA variation of above method; it is different in sense that muzzle of shotgun is directly pointed (aimed) AT the target as a starting point and then swung ahead to shoot. Rest of details same i.e. maintaining follow thru and cheek on stock.\r\n\r\n(3) Sustained Lead Method:\r\nThis method requires the gun to be brought (pointed) ahead of target as starting point, maintaining a constant lead by SEEING (through a mental picture) the required lead, and then firing with follow thru etc. It is a difficult method to master especially so for beginners but is very effective at skeet and those targets such as in sporting clay events where targets flush/spring suddenly and disappear in no time, giving just a momentary opportunity to shooter to hit it. Trap Shooting however is done only with the first method as third method can''t be adopted on it, as is obvious from the clay''s flight path. \r\n\r\nMost rough shooting (especially upland bird hunting) is done in the first two styles, while last (3rd) style is usually best for Olympic Skeet like we do here. But it is not necessary to use this method on it. I use a combination of 1st & 2nd methods, at skeet shooting as well as at gamebirds. So its more like an individual choice. Any beginner is advised to follow the first method and practice DRY swing at targets/birds off & on, rather as much possible.\r\n\r\nThere are certain advantages and applicability of each method too & which situations or sport, one method is better over the other ...its another debate.\r\n\r\nHowever ....it is alwayzz recommended to adopt or start off with the correct shooting style from day one. And also, better late than never & to set the basics right as early as one can. Just like for example Cricket where unless the basics of stance and bat movement is not set right, the ball does not center onto the bat. And after the basics are perfected, you just have to keep an eye (focused) on the ball, and dazz, off the ball goes centered. Both sports, I am talking from experience as have indulged into both quite a lot. But at shooting, I always am short of some error or another, because it actually is an EVER LEARNING discipline coupled by the fact that a lot of role is played by your reflexes (mind). Relflex training is another essential of shotgunning which is another debate. But briefly touching on it, I have experienced and heard too, that, if a person keeps up with an athletic lifestyle such as pursuing reflex training sports like squash, badminton, even table tennis, cricket, or any other similar target movement and body-eye-reflex training simulation, I can guarantee you, your reflexes are never going to become dull at shotgunning, provided the basics of shooting style, stance etc are already been made a natural part of you through repetitive training.\r\n\r\nI hope I am not delving deep into the technicalities ...though tried to put it in as simplified a manner as possible. \r\n\r\nHappy Shotgunning!! :)', ''),

(362513, 'This One - Must Have The 22LR is the ultimate rifle to have. If you are newcomer to the shooting hobby, 22LR is the caliber of choice. Simply put - you get to shoot more for less money than any other brass cartridge. Word-wide, it is the most popular caliber. More 222LR cartridges are sold than all other calibers combined.\r\n\r\nGet a 22LR rifle. You, your children and generations to come will have decades of fun. With a 22LR you can engage small game to 100 yards with ease. You don''t have to worry about getting a kick in the shoulder when you pull the trigger as the recoil is minimal - consider it almost next to zero.\r\n\r\nAsk anyone with a big caliber rifle - how much they shoot. The answer is likely to be be - not much. The reason - big caliber ammunition cost more than 22LR ammo. Instead of shooting often their big bore rifles, they spend lot of time dusting and polishing the metal because it gathers dust, idle in a rack or leaned against a wall.\r\n\r\nShooting 22LR becomes an art - hitting a target at a distance from one football goal post to the other goal post or even father. Each time you hit the x-ring, you will get a thrill that will last you a long time. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion for you is to enjoy life - get a 22LR rifle. If you already have one or more big caliber rifles but not a 22LR, why not get one and join the happy 22LR family. We will welcome you with open arms.', ''),

(362516, ' [QUOTE=Mian-50;201176]Dear brother Snowleopard,\r\n\r\n As I said earlier,GORAS are the people who invented/brought shooting/upland\r\n hunting to this part of the World ,so their shotgunning experts have contributed\r\n a lot towards this cause.\r\n\r\n Stanbury & Churchill styles basically explain [B]STANCE & GUN HOLD[/B] ideas which\r\n are both workable.\r\n\r\n For instance,one says TO KEEP THE GUN-STOCK UNDER YOUR ARM PIT AND\r\n PUSH FORWARD AND BRING IT BACK TO YOUR SHOULDER POCKET IN A \r\n SMOOTH FASHION.\r\n\r\n The other says KEEP YOUR GUN-STOCK LITTLE FORWARD ALONG THE RIB\r\n CAGE,BRING IT STRAIGHT UP TO THE BASE OF YOUR CHEEK BONE AND \r\n SHOULDER POCKET SIMOULTANEOUSLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n Again one says TO KEEP YOUR UPPER BODY WEIGHT 60% ON FRONT BALL\r\n OF YOUR LEADING FOOT AND 40% ON REAR FOOT ,TO HAVE EASE OF \r\n MOVEMENT FOR ALL TYPE OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\nFirst one says STAND MORE UPRIGHT,SO THAT YOUR WEIGHT IS EQUALLY\r\n DISTRIBUTED ON BOTH FEET.\r\n\r\nBrother FRANCOLINO has rightly said,that  SOONER THE BAD TECHNIQUES IN\r\nANY FORM OF SPORTS ARE GET AWAY WITH THE BETTER OR OTHERWISE\r\nWE WILL KEEP PAYING FOR AMMO COST IN SAME FASHION LIKE\r\nHAWAI-FIRING OR POINTLESS FIRING.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nGood detail about both techniques - Stanbury Vs Churchill - I was not familiar with the 2 terms (had not heard about them at all). So bro Mian-50, what in your opinion is better of two approaches for partridge, skeet and duck. Or does it make no big difference...however it suits one indiv, one should follow??\r\n\r\nAnd one suggestion to all (interested) for improving quail and partridge hitting % via clay ranges:\r\nTry to fire some boxes at trap range (10-16 yds before the trap box for practice, not competitive shooting) with the #8 regular load Shaheen that is the most favored field load for the two birds, use same at range too, and not the #7, 25 grams, 7/8 oz trap load. And instead of pre-mounting the gun as is done in competitive trap, hold it at waist level like in skeet as if you were about to witness an actual bird flushing from ground about 10-16 yds ahead of you in 4 or 5 different random unknown angles (as is bird released in trap). After saying PULL, timer will release the clay in multiple angles randomly with time delay of 0-3 secs, This way the OUTGOING upland gamebird will be practiced as is typical of quail and partridge flight, via trap shooting as well. And then have a few rounds of skeet same day or some other day to train fluid gun mount and eye-body-reflex training etc, imagining as if you are in the game field and not at range, anticipating actual gamebirds flushing from the two opposing directions (high house & the low house).\r\n\r\n@LH, for duck shooting training, nothing beats pigeon shooting (actual bird pigeon). After firing 2-3 boxes at this great bird (great in terms of flight) in two or three shoots, you will see that you won''t miss duck. But skeet will definintely train you ''overall'' towards it, by attaining the reflex to take on multiple shots at waterfowl flocks in quick succession with good consistency. Again, am talking from experience. So, it depends on how ones adjusts.', ''),

Target was a net download / printout adapted from standard NRA targets for 10 yd range. Ammo: POF2Z of 2006 lot. The three mags supplied made the session interesting...45 rounds till next refill. \r\n\r\n      Found No issues what-so-ever with the gun and firing, except for probably my own handling of the gun; I did not take along the backstraps to range. The grip felt ok before firing, probably due to a very good grip texture which adheres to ones palm...but then gun handling is different when actually firing. My hands being big, I think I need to install the Medium or large backstrap to give a better hand grip configuration. Next time I will change backstraps and then see the results for final adoption.\r\n\r\n      I fired first fill of 45 rounds at slow rate taking careful aim with each shot. 3-5 sec pauses and sometimes more to check the gun. Second set was rapid fire with quick mag changes and the third set (two mags) fired from single handed firing side stance. All firing went well. The target was well punched. \r\n\r\n     The rounds mostly hit below the bull, probably due my discomfort due to smaller backstrap choice. Experts may comment...\r\n\r\n     In a nutshell, the gun handles extremely well....read some bad press about FTFire due to recoil spring issues but none observed.

(362587, ' [QUOTE=francolino;201234]Good detail about both techniques - Stanbury Vs Churchill - I was not familiar with the 2 terms (had not heard about them at all). So bro Mian-50, what in your opinion is better of two approaches for partridge, skeet and duck. Or does it make no big difference...however it suits one indiv, one should follow??\r\n\r\nAnd one suggestion to all (interested) for improving quail and partridge hitting % via clay ranges:\r\nTry to fire some boxes at trap range (10-16 yds before the trap box for practice, not competitive shooting) with the #8 regular load Shaheen that is the most favored field load for the two birds, use same at range too, and not the #7, 25 grams, 7/8 oz trap load. And instead of pre-mounting the gun as is done in competitive trap, hold it at waist level like in skeet as if you were about to witness an actual bird flushing from ground about 10-16 yds ahead of you in 4 or 5 different random unknown angles (as is bird released in trap). After saying PULL, timer will release the clay in multiple angles randomly with time delay of 0-3 secs, This way the OUTGOING upland gamebird will be practiced as is typical of quail and partridge flight, via trap shooting as well. And then have a few rounds of skeet same day or some other day to train fluid gun mount and eye-body-reflex training etc, imagining as if you are in the game field and not at range, anticipating actual gamebirds flushing from the two opposing directions (high house & the low house).\r\n\r\n@LH, for duck shooting training, nothing beats pigeon shooting (actual bird pigeon). After firing 2-3 boxes at this great bird (great in terms of flight) in two or three shoots, you will see that you won''t miss duck. But skeet will definintely train you ''overall'' towards it, by attaining the reflex to take on multiple shots at waterfowl flocks in quick succession with good consistency. Again, am talking from experience. So, it depends on how ones adjusts.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nfrancolino sir your suggestion of practicing before the season is very helpful but unfortunately people like me living in outskirts having no facility of  any shooting range in our hometown is a bit non-practical.............\r\nOur opportunity of practicing before full swing of the hunting season  is the poor "Labairs" (Turtle doves) ,as our season starts from 1st of September and plenty of birds are available for some good shooting practice till the mid of oct... on the same hunting fields (river side rice fields specially) snipes are also available for some pre-partridge shooting practice..........\r\n\r\nregarding two shooting stances described by sir Mian-50, in my very limited experience i think the first one "keeping the gun under the arm pit and then going for the shot" should be/ or in fact is in use for duck/dove hunting as the hunter is mostly sitting or standing waiting for the bird to come, so he has enough time to see the bird from quite a good distance and can mount the gun when needed.........\r\nthe second one "keeping the gun near rib cage and then going for the shot" should be/or in fact in use for partridges/quails hunting as the hunter is on the move and mostly having a good gun dog along who points or gives you the signs of birds nearer to you so you can mount the gun as per this stance or keeping this stance you can walk on the fertile parts of the hunting field without any problem......\r\nregarding skeet or trap shooting i am zero/zero in knowledge so no comments........', ''),

(362597, 'The Green Migration Lets have some comment on anticipated birds migration to PK.  Can we please share the details of individual bird migration, habitats available, route, timing, limiting and controlling factors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to quote an article of SA Shirazi in this regards with few websites of interest.  \r\n\r\nAuthor: (S.A.J Shirazi)\r\nPakistan gets a large number of guest birds from Europe, Central Asian States and India every year. The birds from North spend winters in different wetlands and deserts of Pakistan, which are distributed almost throughout the country, from the high Himalayas to coastal mangroves and mud flats in the Indus delta. And, after winters they go back to their native habitats.\r\n\r\nThis famous route from Siberia to various destinations in Pakistan over Karakorum, Hindu Kush, and Suleiman Ranges along Indus River down to the delta is known as International Migratory Bird Route Number 4. It is also called as the Green Route or more commonly Indus Flyway.\r\n\r\nEndowed with a remarkable geology, Pakistan spans several of the world’s ecological regions and is spread over broad latitude. The rich Indus delta and the highlands in Pakistan are a great attraction for the guest birds. Which is why the Indus Flyway is one of the busiest in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe birds start on this route in November. February is the peak time and by March they start flying back home. These periods may vary depending upon weather conditions in Siberia and or Pakistan. There are a total of seven identified flyways in the world: from Northern Europe to Scandinavian countries, Central Europe to Mediterranean Sea, Western Siberia to Red Sea, Green Route from Siberia to Pakistan, Ganga Flyway from Eastern Siberia to India, Manchuria to Korea and one from Chakotaka to California. Besides these there are many regionaland smaller routs all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe Indus Flyway is important due to the diverse species and large number of birds that take this itinerary: different species of water fowls, cranes, teals, pintail, mallard and gadwall, the list goes on. Some extinguishing species like white-headed duck, houbara bustard and Siberian crane also travel on this route.\r\n\r\nAs per an estimate based on regular counts at different Pakistani wetlands, between 700,000 and 1,200,000 birds arrive in Pakistan through Indus Flyway every year. Out of which over 70 per cent of the admirable visitors stay in Thanedar Wala Game Reserve (International Ramsar site number(IRS) 97 where Crane Refuge has also been constructed), Tenda Dam (IRS98), Kinjhar Lakes (IRS 99), Drigh (IRS 100). Haleji Lake (IRS 101) where in the past, over 100,000 migratory birds of more than 222 species had been reported, and which was once called the Bird Watchers’ Paradise by the then president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh), Ucchali Complex (IRS818), Taunsa (IRS 817), Chishma (IRS 816), Rasul, Qadar Abad Barrages, and Lal Sohanra. There are 45 sanctuaries and reserves spread over anarea of about 0.90 million hectares in Sindh alone. Some of the birds that come to our country from northern latitudes arrive at coastal creeks. The remaining birds land up in lakes, which are fondly and proudly maintained by landowners. Only a few places in the world have such plentiful variety of winged life as the wetlands of Pakistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[url]http://pakistaniat.com/2006/11/29/pakistan-birds/[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.wildlifeofpakistan.com/PakistanBirdClub/birdcomeflyingin.html[/url]\r\n\r\nBirds Knowhow  site:\r\n[url]http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?cid=7&id=14[/url]', ''),

In case of auto Vigo have to get the rear brakes adjusted every 5000 to 8000 kms if your hand brake clicks more than 5 times you need to adjust the rear brakes, the front ones are self adjusting being disc. In Vigo of 2008 and 9  and later all are disc so no adjusting required.  After 7 years (2005) of hard use I was thinking of going for a 2010 or 2009 Vigo but then I see no need as mine is still good as new. So bought a few pistols and rifles instead of changing my trusty friend.', ''),

(362711, 'BIRDS Pakistan has developed first Stirling Solar Generator! First prototype Solar Dish Stirling Generator is developed indegenously in Pakistan. The independant Think Tank "Brains for Innovative Research Development & Strategic Studies" is a gathering of experts for the betterment of society. BIRDS is doing research on a number of innovative and future technologies to address the energy crises in particular as well as sustainability in health, education, food & water & shelter through emerging technologies in GRAIN; Genetics, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Nanotechnology. BIRDS is using renewable energy, information technology & internet, social media as tools of change.\r\n\r\nThe latest development which is Solar Dish Stirling Generator is result of 4 years of research & development. This project involves scientists & engineers who volunteered unconditionally. \r\n\r\nThe generator uses solar heat as primary source of energy; a parabolic mirror concentrates the solar thermal radiatin onto face plate of a Stirling Engine that in turn converts thermal energy into mechanical energy with a maximum effeciency of 35% (which is maximum effeciency among all renewable solutions) and rotates a shaft. A DC generator then transform this mechanical energy into usable electricity. \r\n\r\nA single unit can produce 10KW/hour electriciy and can easily be installed at roof top like satellite dish antinna. A built in sun tracker keeps the dish facing the sun for optimum performance. Solar Dish Stirling Generator has a working life of 70 years, easier to maintenance than normal vehicle engines, has no carbon emission so environment friendly and cost effective. BIRDS forcast the price of single 1 KW unit will be approx 2 Lakh once commercial production unit is established. Larger Dishes of 10 KW can be arranged in Solar Parks in thousands to produce upto 500 mega watts for larger power generation requirements.\r\n\r\nBIRDS Chairman Noman A. Shah (Survivalist @ PG) told that "We have achieved a milestone that is proof of concept but without sufficient resources it might take several years to develop a commercial scale Solar Dish Stirling Generator. Country has great potential for development of renewable energy, as Pakistan has the capacity to produce 41,722 MW hydro power, 346,000 MW wind power potential and 2.9 Million MW from solar system. We are also planning to develop an institute of emerging technologies and suatainable development in Punjab. Any support thereof will enhance our capacity and speed up the process of innovation and technology development resulting in facilitation to the nation".\r\n\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3008[/ATTACH]', ''),

I''ve fired one with Larry''s job done, \r\nand didn''t find it sooo much better, but everyone has an opinion. \r\n- Plenty accurate \r\n- Simple field strip \r\n- Fills a price point between the Ruger/Browning and the Smith 41 and \r\nEuro guns. \r\nI do question the build quality, at least of the Sig Trailsides. The internet is littered with people that had problems. Mostly with the slide not locking open after the last round, and the cracked trigger guard(?). Both of those are fairly easy to remedy. Cracked slides was a less common issue, though who knows if that was the result of high-velocity ammo and such. Still, it''s enough to make me leary of the Trailside, being that Sig no longer supports them. Larry''s can no doubt fix any problem, but start throwing a few hundred $ at the gun, and you''re at the next price point. There''s a beautiful 6" Trailside with adj sights that my dealer just took in, asking $475, and likely some wiggle room there. Much as I''d like to pick it up, I''m very hesitant. \r\nIf however you were considering a new Xesse from Larry''s, I say go for it. Shoot the heck out of it while it''s under warranty. The most basic model starts at $699, and I think the target model 6" is just under $1,000. For that you could get a new Smith 41 or preferably a nice vintage one. \r\nNot sure where you''re looking price-wise. \r\nBut to your question... I think the Xesse could be a good choice. Especially if you''re looking for something on the lighter side. \r\nIf you do, please post a thorough range review, as there''s nothing out there."\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.targettalk.org/viewtopic.php?t=27096[/url]', ''),

The pistol can also fire re-usable darts and i have also attached the pictures of same. the big thing is that its original packing box made of cardboard is also preserved although time has taken its toll on paper at some places. \r\n2. Pre - WWI vintage bayonets with original leather scabbards. one os made in 1913 and the other one in 1907. Both the blades are well preserved. i once thought of putting them in fancy show case or frame but keeping the weather of Karachi in mind i dropped the idea lest i expose these to rusty environment.\r\n3. Third is also a vintage Webley air pistol, not in good condition due to my fault. i left it un preserved/un greased and weather caught it while i was away for some time. trying to restore it back but seem difficult. also the barrel (also cocking handle) is slightly bent due excessive use. i ll post its pics as soon as it is restored to reasonable state \r\n4. My S&W victory model .38\r\nFourth is my old time favourite BSA Lightning with Hawke scope.  \r\n5. to be added one colt .45 and may be Taurus 24/7 or PT 99 as advised by some of the members in particular farrukh bhai\r\n\r\nwhen i reviewed my post not all pics are uploaded but only 8 i dont  know why can someone pls educated me on that\r\nThank you', ''),

I personally think it won''t as Competition air rifles are a totally different ball game, with a decent one costing $2k and above that 50% duty does make a difference.\n\nPersonally the only way to get cheap and good airguns in Pakistan is to further develop local airguns such as the "Rainbow". I know many people complain of spring and other problems but a spring will get weaker with use even in the best airguns.[/QUOTE]\n Brother last updated price of Shadow 1000 as read here: [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/archive/index.php/t-6025.html[/URL] was 26k in KHI.That is too much in my opinion (but I believe it was bargain-able also). \n\n[QUOTE] Personally the only way to get cheap and good airguns in Pakistan is to  further develop local airguns such as the "Rainbow".

Because of expensive airguns like Diana, we tend to take care of them ourselves. I''ve read in different threads when we had to find a good replacement for their springs. IMHO if such care and respect is carried forwards to well reputed local airguns like Rainbow they should last a great deal more.', ''),

Brandishing is a technical law term which means to "show, WILLFULLY, your firearm with AN INTENT to THREATEN OR KILL". It is allowed in certain circumstances and even preferred over PtS strategy (Point to Shoot). For example if you see a guy 30 feet away coming at you with a knife, you might wanna first brandish your firearm to see if he changes his mind at all. At closer ranges, well it may not advisable to wait for his reactions but to point to shoot and disable/neutralize. \n\nThere is a difference between printing and brandishing. Printing is when there is no intent or will to show your firearm, its not in naked view, and only an outline of the firearm is visible to an extent that even a child may figure out that you have a gun hidden. Brandishing is when you pull your gun out with an intent.\n\nAlso, there is the issue of shooting to kill or neutralize. In many cases in the court, so I was told, the shooter was convicted because he shot to kill and not to neutralize without causing fatal injuries. The technical aspect of this is: if you think you can neutralize the adversary in a given situation without killing him, you should NOT shoot to kill. In extreme situations with multiple attackers where you don''t have the time to decide, the first priority should be to make an escape route. Remember that your firearm is for self defense not for killing but to give you enough latitude to escape. However, I don''t think it is advisable to not to kill an adversary whom you think would be capable of harming you if not shot and killed.\n\nIts quite a technical manner and I would suggest everyone to read up on it or consult a lawyer if they carry on a daily basis.\n\nThank you Naveed Bro for the excellent share. Much appreciated.\n\nRegards,\nA normal middle class citizen who is prohibited to show his firearm in public, lol,\nCD.', ''),

What do u say about that?[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nThat exactly what I meant.. as I mentioned before both guns are addictive and overall wonderful but still Shadow has an edge over combat in accuracy, trigger, recoil and capacity except that its heavier than combat and you can''t carry it all day long.. since you already have a CZ 75B try something different this time.. Dr Zakir is in favour of combat.. other might favour Shadow but in the end you are the one to make the final decision.. I do have both and I love them equally, still I would say Shadow has an edge over 85 Combat.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand combat is not that lighter than shadow to be carried comfortably all day long  and I am sure it will give you a tough time (Backache) by the end of the day Lolzzz IMHO.', ''),

Weight is OK, not on the higher side. Recoil is powerful too. Dogs, piglets, metals, etc are no match for it. Long Range. If you can get a recoil proof scope, then don''t think of any other airgun. I don''t know what else to write as I am not into reviews. Quality wood has been used in it, just oil the metal once a month or so and it''ll be fine. Note able thing is that do not use Local/Irani/Afghani pellets in it. They can damage the barrel and are too light therefore not accurate at all. Use pellets of atleast 15 grains and preferably over 18 grains. Just waiting for H&N Rabbit Magnum pellets and will try to get some jackals and piglets.

The trigger is adjustable and around 4.5 pounds from the factory. \n\nNow for some pictures:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/DW1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/DW7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw10.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nFollowing are some comparative pics with the Taurus 1911 which is our benchmark for 1911''s here in Pakistan.\n\nMy PT1911 is a full framed 1911 with a 5 inch barrel while the Valor is a   Commander model which basically has a shorter barrel length for easier   carry.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw11.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw12.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw13.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw14.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw15.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw17.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw16.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIn my opinion there is no comparison in quality between these two guns.   The DW is in another class altogether. A decent comparison would be  with  other 1911 names like Kimber or perhaps even Les Baer. \n\nSince this is a carry gun rather than a range gun what really  makes it  stand out is the DUTY or Ceramic coating on the stainless steel   frame/slide. It is very scratch resistant and although I would not like   to experiment on my piece this link  [URL]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/01/05/czs-new-dan-wesson-valor-1911-with-duty-coating/[/URL]  should make things clear.\n\nShooting the Valor:\n\nI couldn''t wait for range day to shoot the DW. Bought 300 rounds of different makes to test it. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/DW18.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw19.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLoaded the mags, racked the slide to chamber the round, the gun felt   even better. Fired it and went "****", but then I''m not much of a .45  fan. My targets were not post  worthy and asked Starfish, Anthrax and  Omer Butt to shoot the gun for  posting. All shot the crap out of the  targets at 15 M. Groups were  everywhere. Thanks guys, making me look  bad [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/images/smilies2/mmph.gif[/IMG] [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/images/smilies/wink.png[/IMG]\n\nTargets below:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw20.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw21.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/IMG_0521.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe gun itself is fabulous and extremely accurate. It is a pure carry  gun with does not  disappoint come range day. None of the guys who shot  this gun had any  issues with it, I did however have some observations. \n\n1). The grip chequring is too aggressive for me at 25 LPI. I would have   preferred it at something like 30 or 35. The gun is very grippy indeed   with the 25 but made my hands feel like cheese through a grater after  30  rounds.\n\n2). The trigger sort of bites your fingertip. Each shot felt like a pin prick. \n\n3). The recoil is substantial, so much so that after firing the first 5   shots everyone was shooting atleast 2/3 inches from the center.\n\n4). Trigger although at 4 / 4.5 has a very slight creep in it. I would   love no creep and would not mind predictable creep but the way it   breaks, I did not like 100 %.\n\nI tried a misfit Houge over the grips to see if it helped improve shooting and it did but the trigger still bit. \n\nI have shot upto 1500 rounds in a day but never have I had swollen   fingers, the DW is the only gun to make my hands and fingertip in   particular to swell and hurt for more than 24 hours. One might compare  it to a rug burn, it hurts but you''re happy why you got it [IMG]http://www.pakguns.com/images/smilies/wink.png[/IMG]\n\nI would like to say that all of the other friends who fired it  did not  experience any of the above except more recoil but then this is  not a  range gun, it is a pure thoroughbred combat handgun which allows  you to  shoot two or three mags at the the range now and then. \n\n[U][B]Verdict[/B][/U]: An absolute prize for anyone who likes to carry .45''s and the full length Valor is the best 1911 around, period.', 'Review: Dan Wesson Valor .45 ACP');

Purpose was to get the handgun solely for Self-Defence. Started looking for one and well, CZ answered the call! More precisely, DUTY answered the call for DUTY! :D \n\n[SIZE=+2][B]Initial Impression; [/B][/SIZE]\n\nThe first time I ever held the DUTY, I knew instantly that this would answer the call to my requirements. It was very light weight with an amazing grip angle, the grips themselves are a bit aggressive but that''s because it doesn''t come with the option to change the grip so it fit perfectly. The sights are standard nonadjustable and they give a ''Glock'' like impression to the user. Trigger comes with the CZ''s new ''Omega Trigger System'' and breaks clean and crisp. Quite impressive! For a polymer, slim-profile 9mm, the gun holds 16 rounds of 9x19. Also comes with a picatinny rail system for mounting light/laser. \n\nHere''s a video of my first impression of the gun; \n\n[video=youtube;6Xtmg5zG7Vg]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xtmg5zG7Vg&feature=relmfu[/video]\n\n[SIZE=+2][B]Range Report; [/B][/SIZE]\n\n[IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/30w36s4.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe DUTY''s been through 200+ rounds so far and it pretty much ate up everything I fed it.

For a compact pistol with a 3.7 inch barrel, this pistol goes beyond the call of DUTY (Cheesy, I know :P) I was expecting a lot of recoil from this weapon but frankly, you barely feel it (If you grip it right) and it''s quite manageable! \n\n[SIZE=+2][B]Practical Shooting - Self-Defence Scenario/Draw from Concealment [/B][/SIZE]\n\nI decided to test this weapon from a carry point of view as well. 3 threats were at 7 7/12 meters away and only 6 rounds were in the magazine. I was carrying the weapon concealed and on Starfish''s signal, the shooting began! Took a little less than 5 seconds to down three targets. Results?

It''s accurate, it''s deadly, it''s compact but packs a BIG PUNCH!

(363387, 'Maintenance: Cleaning an Autoloader Shotgun; Maintenance: Cleaning an Autoloader Shotgun; [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\n\nOne of the many evils facing an autoloader shotgun is the carbon fouling that occurs due to the employment of propellant gases in cycling the action. This type of a scattergun uses the force of the gas, created by the accelerated burning of the propellant, not just to propel the wadding which pushes the shot down the barrel, but also to cycle the action, eject the empty shell and load another from the magazine. This though efficient, is far more complex than traditional break-open shotguns thus mandating a through cleaning and maintenance regime to keep everything working.\n\nTiming is everything in the smooth functioning of an autoloader. All autoloading shotguns depend on a precisely timed sequence of events. If one step is slow, it can upset the sequence. A dirty chamber, filthy action, crud in your trigger group or magazine or a weak spring can alter the timing just enough to turn your soft shooting automatic in to a [B]jamomatic[/B].\n\nHow often you should give your shotgun a through cleaning will depend on the shotgun, your loads and the environment in which you shoot. Keep track of the numbers of shells that you have put through the gun since the last cleaning and make note of when the gun first starts to cycle slowly. A pattern will emerge that will tell you how often the gun should be taken apart and cleaned. It could be as few as 100 rounds or as high as 1,000.\n\n[B]Normally, I advise four different type of cleaning routines depending upon usage:[/B]\n\n[B]1. Up to 100 rounds:[/B] Just run a solvent soaked patch down the bore a couple of times.\n\n[B]2. Up to 200 rounds:[/B] run a solvent soaked patch down the bore a couple of times, take the barrel off, no need for any further disassembly and wipe everything with a solvent soaked path.\n\n[B]3. Up to 500 rounds:[/B] run a solvent soaked patch down the bore a couple of times, take the barrel off, remove the chokes and clean them with a solvent, take the trigger assembly out, no need for any further disassembly and wipe/clean everything with a solvent soaked path.\n\n[B]4. Up to 1000 round:[/B] disassemble the gun down to bits and clean/scrub everything with a quality solvent. Preferably, fix the barrel in a jig and using a cleaning rod attached to a hand held drill, polish the bore. It can also be done manually (the old fashion way) but with lots and lots of elbow grease (the old fashion way).\n\n[B]Some Safety Instructions Before We Continue:[/B]\n\n“Be sure you always handle your firearm safely. Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction, treat the firearm as if it were loaded, and keep your finger off the trigger. Pull the bolt-grip back, and release it. Repeat until no shells are visible in the magazine tube or in the chamber. After visually inspecting that the firearm is empty, manually insert your finger in the chamber and cartridge elevator to feel if there is any cartridge in there. Be double-sure your firearm is unloaded. You do not want an unexpected boom while cleaning your firearm. Keep your ammunition separate from your shotgun while cleaning.\n\n[B]A Disclaimer (as always ;)):[/B] \n\n[I]The following content is for informational purposes only.

This is the true cost of the pleasure that you get after shooting an autoloader shotgun.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image4.jpg[/IMG]\n\nA closer looks reveals the burnt/scorching marks left by hot gases. no worries. nothing a quality solvent soaked scotch brite/steel wool cannot handle.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image5.jpg[/IMG]\n\nScrub all your worries away. over time I have developed a special liking for steel wool as it not only removes gunk/carbon fouling/burnt marks but also polishes the metal to a mirror shine. however I cannot insist enough to use the softest steel wool available or if you want to play it safe, use a scotch brite pad. our objective is to clean and shine, not to remove the finish. many high end shotguns offer hard chrome plated internals for the very same reason. to withstand serious scrubbing and to aid in cleaning. with scotch brite pad due to its relative softness to a steel wool, you''ll require more effort (in other words, more elbow grease). one more thing, do not use steel wool on anything that has been colored, painted, blued, browned, blackened and parkerized. steel wool is for stainless steel and hard chrome plated parts only.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nEverything all clean and shiny. as far as the internals of the receiver is concerned, all it needs is a blast of solvent followed brushing with a tooth brush to losen all the grime/carbon/gunk then another blast to flush away all the nasties followed by wiping everything down with clean cotton cloth.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image7.jpg[/IMG]\n\npull the bolt back to make more space inside visible and also to make space for the brush to go in and do its thing. make sure to brush the bolt face and its surroundings. special attention need to be given to the cuts and crevices inside the receiver. they collect the most nasties during operation.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image11.jpg[/IMG]\n\nA good bast of your favorite solvent/clp along with brushing everything with tooth brush should clean the trigger assembly. This should also improve the overall trigger feel of the gun.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image8.jpg[/IMG]\n\nnow moving on to the barrel. using any quality bore solvent (caution: bore solvents are strong chemicals, use in open well ventilated area only) applied on a cotton patch, run it through the barrel bore a couple of time. let it sit for a couple of minutes. in the meantime you can remove the choke and clean it with the same bore solvent. then go back to the barrel bore and using clean (dry) cotton patches (one by one) clean as much as you can. remove as much of the carbon and plastic fouling as you can. your objective here is to make sure that the final patch comes out clean. I normally suggest that you use multiple clean cotton patches one by one till the time the the final patch comes out reasonably clean.\n\nsince we are dealing with an autoloader shotgun that depends on hot gases bleeding through gas ports in the barrel, we must vigorously clean this area as well because this area usually accumulates the most of grime/carbon/gunk. one may use a scotch brite pad or steel wool just remember to scrub the inside of the gas cylinder and not the outside as it will remove the finish (bluing or whatever).\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image9.jpg[/IMG]\n\nevery patch has two sides so you can use the same patch twice by simply inverting it and having another go at it. as you can see that the final patch still shows some carbon/gunk on it. but since its only a shotgun and i''m not going to use the barrel as a drinking straw I do not need to go any further.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/DSA%20Cleaning/Image10.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWith everything clean as it should, lubricate everything as per your lubrication preferences and put the humpty dumpty back together again.\n\n[B]Regards.[/B]\n\np.s.

(363388, 'Improving The Performance of Your Budget Shotgun; Improving The Performance of Your Budget Shotgun Part 1; [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\n\nDuring one of my routine (but always extremely enlightening) conversations with Starfish, we both came to a conclusion that a budget shotgun''s performance and pleasure can be enhanced by a respectable level by adding some (functional only) after-market parts/accessories. Immediately light bulbs started flashing in our heads and we had ourselves a little project to kill a little time (and a few million brain cells in the process) over it.\n\nAs with any project, the price factor comes into play and we had to decide on the budget for the after-market parts/accessories. Starfish proposed that any Customization/ Add-ons should not cost any more than 30% percent of the value of a budget shotgun.\n\nHaving been given this target, I set out to customize a Baikal MP-27EM-1C over and under shotgun also known as IZH-27EM-1C (Same thing, just different product identification code). \n\n[B]Any how, all settled, this is what I had:[/B]\n\nBaikal MP-27EM-1C O/U Shotgun (Price): 50K\nBudget for Customizations/Add-ons: 15K (30% of 50K, Dah!)\n\n[B]This is what I wanted:[/B] (to improve the performance/pleasure of a budget shotgun)\n\n[B]Quality Recoil Pad:[/B] Limbsaver or Kickeez\n\nMy research led me to believe that both enjoy top of the line reputation and significantly reduce recoil. However one offering in Limbsaver''s precision fit line gave me the near perfect fit that I was looking for. Grinding and fitting a grind-to-fit recoil requires a lot of patience and I am the sort of a man who is always a little short on patience.\n\n[B]Better Sighting System:[/B] Fiberoptic or White Front Bead\n\nPersonal preference really but I like a good white bead (or a fiberoptic) at the business end of my shotgun. Some might argue that a bead doesn''t do much in improving a shotgun''s performance, well…, for me, Ya it does! Something that looks and feels that good can''t be wrong. Call me superstitious. Moving on!\n\n[B]Improved Patterns:[/B] Trulock Chokes or Carlsons After-market Chokes\n\nI measured the factory chokes supplied with the shotgun and boy! You''ll be surprised how way off the mark they were so had to do something about that.\n\nThere are quiet a few names in after-market chokes tubes but I''ve found that Trulock not only offers the most variety for Baikal shotguns but were also very welcoming in sending their precision engineered products to their International Customers in Pakistan. Therefore the choice was pretty clear. One thing I would like to mention here is that I''ve talked to almost every manufacturer of after-market chokes in the United States and nobody (I''ll repeat, nobody) even comes close to the quality of customer service that Trulock provides. Period!\n\nAs to which chokes tubes I needed, after reading up and consulting a few friends, I figured Skeet, Improved Cylinder, Modified and Full should pretty much cover most of everything I do with a shotgun.\n\n[B]Now the Pictures:[/B]\n\nI sincerely apologize for the poor quality of the pictures. Some are just not blessed with good camera skills. On top of that, creativity has never been one of my virtues.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00611.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAll Add-ons added to the shotgun. The patch you seen on the comb of the shotgun is actually an improvised cheek pad. Why I needed one, we''ll come to that later.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00612.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSame shotgun, different view. I''m basically trying out my luck with photography here.\n \n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00614.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWe can clearly see that the limbsaver recoil pad is pretty close to a perfect fit (at least 95%). Let me say that it way better than any factory/OEM recoil pad I have come across so far. It houses dual chambers that compress when a shot is fired, significantly lowering the [B]thump[/B] of the recoil (technical jargon: recoil pulse).\n\nI could have gone for a Kickeez recoil pad which is also a big name in recoil reduction however Sorbothane (the stuff Kickeez recoil pads are made out of) weighs a lot and in my humble opinion, it feels like that it will catch on clothes a lot during mount. However Kickeez definitely looks better finished than a Limbsaver. \n\nFrom engineering standpoint, Kickeez is a pad made of Sorbothane (noise/shock dampening material) whereas Limbsaver is an engineered product which utilizes compression chambers to spread the recoil pulse. Take your pick based on whatever tickles your fancy.\n\nNow let''s talk a little about the white patch. This particular shotgun had too much drop at comb for me to begin with and as a result I was hitting below the Point of Aim. In order to fix that I needed to raise my rear sight (essentially the operator''s eye). While discussing some quality materials with Denovo87 bhai I came to know that the material he is using to make footballs is near perfect for my use. It''s strong, does not absorb water and doesn''t get stained. So, it was taped onto the comb using ordinary double tape available at auto part shops. Strong enough to last and leaves no residue once removal is required.\n \n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00619.jpg[/IMG]\n\nHere we can clearly see the white bead at the business end of this shotgun. I will not go into the details of advantages/disadvantages of this thing but I wanted one.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00615.jpg[/IMG]\n \nThe same white bead is highly visible even under dim lighting.\n \n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00621.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is what the bead looks like up close. In order to install it, the factory brass bead had to be unscrewed then this white bead of matching threads and diameter of the shank (This is where research comes into play) was screwed on. One can clearly see that the construction of the bead is quiet robust.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00625.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis picture shows Trulock chokes installed in both barrels. One can see that four slots machined into them for a firm grip using a four-slotted wrench. You can use conventional (factory supplied) wrench with them too or you can order one of their proprietary (e.g. speed wrench) wrenches.\n \n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00630.jpg[/IMG]\n\nWe can see that these (flush fitting) chokes are supplied in stainless steel (mirror) finish and are laser marked with respective constriction and choke designation. I must say the finish is the smoothest I have seen so far on any machined object. The first thing that I noticed while screwing them in place was that how easily one can tighten them due to high quality threads machined into each choke tube.

At times, having a stock that has been well fitted to us is outside our reach. and how do we (the less fortunate souls) deal with the problem?\n\nUsually we ignore that there is a problem in the first place and learn to deal with it by crunching our head (or creeping up on the stock) and forcefully making a right cheek weld to acquire the right sight picture. That usually ends up costing us "precious time" in getting the sight picture right and denting our pride and confidence when a bird/clay is lost.\n\nThis is where [URL="http://www.graco-corp.com/"]adjustable combs[/URL] come into play. They offer us an ability to fit our shotgun to dimensions not offered by any off the shelf gun. Disbelievers would normally say “Get a custom stock”. However even the success of a custom stock depends on the accuracy of the measurements. How are those measurements derived? By shooting a gun that adjusts. That certainly makes a case that there is some value in a stock that adjusts as an intermediary step in the quest for perfection.\n\nWith all that, “[URL="http://www.graco-corp.com/"]Adjustable Comb Hardware[/URL] Installation” just had to be my next project. It looks easy though but was extremely complicated and not at all meant for the faint hearted, I am not going to list down the processes required to fit an [URL="http://www.graco-corp.com/"]Adjustable Comb Hardware[/URL] (available from [URL]http://www.graco-corp.com/[/URL]).

[/B]\n\nA little question to explain the complexity of the project before some brave individual decides to have a go with such a project: How do you cut an oval shape stock on a flat bed, at the same ensuring an absolutely perpendicular cut? Believe me, a month of paper work was involved in getting all such questions answered. Had to design separate specialized jigs to hold the butt in place just right for the cutting and drilling. A popular saying goes: measure twice and cut once, believe me, In this particular case, it was measured over a dozen times before even touching. Multiple specialists (local and foreign) were consulted just to find flaws in my proposed execution plan. Finally, when the time came, I summoned in all courage that I had and jumped in head first. Now, to make the long story short, it all went as planned.\n\nHere are the Pictures:\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/05072011015.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/05072011016.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/05072011017.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/05072011018.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011019.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011020.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011022.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011023.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011024.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011025.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011026.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011027.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/06072011028.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is what the gun looks like after adjusting the "Adjustable Comb" to my liking\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011029.jpg[/IMG]\n\nI have raised the comb a little and increased the cast of the shotgun.\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011030.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011031.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011032.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011033.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011035.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011036.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011037.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011040.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011041.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011043.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Adjustable%20Comb%20on%20Baikal%20IZH-27%20or%20MP-27EM-1C/07072011044.jpg[/IMG]', 'Improving The Performance of Your Budget Shotgun - PART 2'),

What Hatsan claims ..

Fired two full magazines (7+1) trying my best to defeat the smart n fast piston but in vain.\n\nAfter the hot load test run, put it on 24gr skeet load for continues 45 shots, there was no difference in cycling speed than the hot loads, recoil was milder though. All went flawlessly making me proud Escort owner.\n\nNow the amazing part of the skeet shoot was the accuracy, I hardly been a 50% bird breaker but with Escort I broke 21 skeets out of first 24 (although from the easiest station but I never did that before)…and my immediate decision was to make it my official skeet gun  :D \n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/013.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/012.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/014.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[U][B]... Shot Spread Pattern ...[/B][/U]\n\nAlso did a basic paper pattern test using Shaheen number 8 shell, with skeet choke, at about 18 yards distance. \nBelow is the picture of the pattern that appeared on the paper and as per brother 12gauge its nicely even spread that does not look like a 40k shotgun pattern.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/Hatsan%20Escort%20Magnum/Pattern.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[U][B]DISLAIMER:[/B][/U] Everything described above is either my experience with the Escort I purchased or the Hatsan claims.

Shaheen''s cartridge length written as Regular 58mm (2.25'''') and Super 64mm (2.5''''). Thats not understood.\r\nSecondly, velocity listed is Regular 300 m/s and Super 340 m/s, which is 984 fps & 1115 fps respectively. This velocity''s comparison with any normal imported cartridge is much below but both Shaheen (e.g. 8# Reg & Super) perform good.\r\n\r\nOther thing is grams or ounce load weight: Skeet & trap lighter loads 25g (7/8 oz), Regular field loads 31g (1-1/10 oz), High brass loads 36g (1-1/4 oz) for more range and penetration.\r\n\r\nSo, @12Gauge bro, why is this confusion. Is the Shaheen now in 70mm length? And the grams? ....is it actually 25g or 28g skeet load?....31g or 32g field load? Does head length of brass cap (8mm, 12mm, 16mm, 22mm) affect velocity or the grams ...or both??', ''),

(363493, ' [QUOTE=PakistanFirst;201231]The 22LR is the ultimate rifle to have. If you are newcomer to the shooting hobby, 22LR is the caliber of choice. Simply put - you get to shoot more for less money than any other brass cartridge. Word-wide, it is the most popular caliber. More 222LR cartridges are sold than all other calibers combined.\r\n\r\nGet a 22LR rifle. You, your children and generations to come will have decades of fun. With a 22LR you can engage small game to 100 yards with ease. You don''t have to worry about getting a kick in the shoulder when you pull the trigger as the recoil is minimal - consider it almost next to zero.\r\n\r\nAsk anyone with a big caliber rifle - how much they shoot. The answer is likely to be be - not much. The reason - big caliber ammunition cost more than 22LR ammo. Instead of shooting often their big bore rifles, they spend lot of time dusting and polishing the metal because it gathers dust, idle in a rack or leaned against a wall.\r\n\r\nShooting 22LR becomes an art - hitting a target at a distance from one football goal post to the other goal post or even father. Each time you hit the x-ring, you will get a thrill that will last you a long time. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion for you is to enjoy life - get a 22LR rifle. If you already have one or more big caliber rifles but not a 22LR, why not get one and join the happy 22LR family.

My father and brother kept .22LR Voere (Made in Austria), Steven, USA (My brother is still keeping one that is Voere, Austria). \r\nA senior hunter advised me that there is no use of .22LR.  I have one observation as well, that is, according to the conditions of hunting animals availability rather scarcity in Pakistan, its really difficult to hunt with .22LR. What do you think?

Just got myself addition of new American decoys by Higdon at Rs5000/- per 12pcs from an importer here.

(363708, ' Boar hunting has been left by majority seasoned hunters now, as they have realized it is a futile & destructive activity.... where young boars (small ones included) and females (included) are sadistically chased on jeeps, shot, wounded and left to rot, with GUN LIGHTS & spotlights using 7+ shot repeaters and rifles ... and the aim only seems sadistic/merciless killing rather than sport or fun. And.... if I remember correctly from somewhere, as Hunting is basically a Sport, so it is better to be a Sportsman, than be a Butcher. One odd boar shot occassionally with rifle or with a clean kill may be called as ''good fun'' (subjective again), but chasing after herds of youngs ones of these poor animals is brutal fun. Now, the environment is changing for the better & many old/seasoned hunters have started to realize it now. Besides, the local Mullah has already instilled a lot of undue hatred for this animal, to wipe it off from face of earth. The results are in front of us all that even the remote pockets of forests have quite a few of these animals left.\r\n\r\nAnd.... as far as the Man-eater of Pirowal & any Robinhood chasing the same animal is concerned, below quote paints the real picture that: The Monster is already gone! :)\r\n[QUOTE=hunter468;202251]lolz\r\nBTW that specific boar was killed by the locals after that incident![/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I wonder whats all this artificial hype created of 10-20 dbl cabs and 300 beaters and dozens of dogs with several gun lights been taken to the Killer Forests of Pirowal with an unconfirmed program ...... made to look like more of a jest, assuming others reading it are kind of naive or new at this sport or something ?!!??!!!', ''),

However Gamo pellets perform well.\n(3)No way bro, don''t waste money on buying heavy and better pellets for low-powered guns. The results will be not-so-attractive.\nJust stick to Irani and Local ones as they deliver greater velocities (fps). i.e. if your rainbow is throwing a 8gn Irani pellet at 550fps, it would not be more than 300fps with 15+ gn pellets.', ''),

Boars, tigers, leopards are the talk of the town, awesome. Folks are hunting like American were killing Iraqi forces at play stations, before war. Counts are increasing like Brain Charles Lara batting against Craig McGrath & Shane Warne. \n\n  \nNow we can hope and predict a very healthy water-fowling this year.\n\n  Unfortunately, I also got some decoys in early eighties and later bought few dozens in mid-eighties from Mian (ch) too. It continued time to time and different species decoys collected from various parts of the world and this appetite never ended till last bulk was purchased from cabalas in 2008-7. \n   \n\n  I also remember the time when we used a massive spread at a large reservoir after finding spread diagrams already pasted by buddies, but never distinguished any difference. Finally, it revealed to us that it&#8217;s not arts really, it&#8217;s a science undoubtedly. Anyhow, while one use decoys constantly they will certainly got cracks, pallets and fainted paints, so obviously pre-season repair is necessary sometime. However, I have experienced ducks never care colors in different times, a strong majority believes ducks are color blind, I also started believing this opinion after various experiences but finally I fixed this confusion too. \n\nThis is a different detail though.\n\n  Without any exaggeration and favors, Mian ch decoys are not bad in this price and I trust them since times. This is my personal humble estimation. I would request him to please favor our PG community and announce some further special discount in price for comrades. We should at least help our community for getting some favor from Mian Sb, taking the opportunity of his companionship, rest goes with once''s own choice.  \n\n\n  I, beg venerated members to please stop criticizing each other in the sale purchase and choice of goods aspects, its matter of personal satisfaction and trust. One should just advise and forward contact information to valued members to buy their trusted and cheapest stuff but please don&#8217;t force others to buy or reject others recommended stuff by forced and retorted arguments.

As I am also a Beretta fan (since long in 1997 when I first bought one), I have a thorough study on it like you too; I dont claim to be any expert though. I have not been able to reach a conclusion about patterning advantages of Mobil over Optima or vice versa, unless and until same constriction choke (e.g. IC) & same cartridge (e.g. #8 Shaheen) is patterned at SAME distance. For that, I will be going to pattern at 30 and 35 yds distance with Shaheen #8 (regular as well as Super) with same choke i.e. Imp Cyl, as IC choke is enough for these distances with LEAD cartridges that we use. Americans have whole different ball game due to banning of lead shell. And therefore, there analysis are not wholely applicable for us. We need to make our own calculations and findings, based on our shotshells. Thus I will post the charts as I am through with them.

They will cherish it knowing that the rifle came from your hands into their hands. Such memories are not forgotten. \r\n\r\nI do not know what other guns you may have and your shooting/hunting interests. The 22LR is ideal for honing shooting skills  - be it for paper targets or hunting in the field. I would like to hear from you as to how you came about acquiring the 511. Was it handed down to you? Did you buy it? In either case, what was the intended purpose for the CZ? Since acquiring it, how often have you used it?\r\n\r\nDo you hunt birds? At my end you can not shoot birds with a rifle - it has to be a shotgun. In this regard I do not know the regulations on your side. If 22LR is permissible, it would be very sportsmanlike to hunt game birds in this way. \r\n\r\nI form a kinship with all that have 22LRs. If you really wanted to sell the 22LR, and I was near your, I would be the first one to say - please sell it to me. Even then, you would be free to borrow the same rifle from me whenever you wanted to use it. But, there no need to think about selling what you already have. Please keep it.\r\n\r\nI have a lengthy article on scope in some stage of editing process. If you would kindly let me know what makes and models of scope are available in your price-range, I will give you my input. I may seek out input from friends if I am not familiar with any scopes that you mention in your response.

Shoot as soon as it is thrown out of the house. Keep the gun pointed right above the house. It is acceptable in tournaments over here. I use a over under with Full choke in over and Modified in under barrel. You want to use an open choke for closer shots and a tighter choke for farther shots. Be comfortable to use barrel selector on the fly and you will be OK. \nI load my own shot shells. For Trap, my best load is 1-1/8 oz #8 shot with Winchester AA wads and 18 Gr Hodgdon Clays. I do change for winter or summer due to air density variations.  Do not completely shoulder the gun before you call "PULL". Keep both eyes open and point the gun towards the flying clay. Practice to sweep left and right by using upper body. Do not hold the gun very tightly. \nPatterning is very important and must be done on every shotgun before putting it into use. Yes, I would pattern for skeets as well and my choice of choke would be again due to terrain and other geographical and natural factors.\nHope this helps.', ''),

We do it (like many too) in newly sown wheat or fresh wheat or angoori wheat etc, so, dense blind and a spot where 500-1000 birds are set and using field for grazing already, with good decoys and some motion creators, geese do tend to almost bump into you.

(364107, ' Nobody is imposing views here. The shooting experience & views differ person to person. I think I already stated that.  Geese hunting is not that difficult for regular geese shooters. And a pro skeet shooter does not a mean a good geese shooter, though I know of the pro skeeter being refered to here, with geese showering over their blind at one of the reserve areas. Geese ka asal shikar hi wo hai jab geese shower kar rahi hon. In USA too, its like that, here too, only difference is the permission mechanism. Thats a different debate. Occassional pass shooting is not geese hunting on which one can say hitting %''s are representative.\r\n\r\nAnd geese hunting has not always been banned - only this last season it was, so, no need to get jittery over a non issue !!! Banned or not ... is not the issue we are discussing here. Chukars, labairs, doves, pigeons, ruddys - all are banned - so in the 1st place, why raise the topic? The point in debate is just a generality. You can''t quantify, not even a 5% ''bad day'' margin.\r\n\r\n@avais brother, Mian-50 sir and all,\r\n* 60% duck shooting means: Give the shooter 10 cartridges and he will give you 6 birds from 10 individual flying target hits...(but, again, are multiple birds dropping with one shot from a flock included or excluded, as it is common also when taking sideways shots at denser flocks].\r\n* 70% geese shooting means: Give the shooter 10 shells and he takes 7 birds from them, again firing 10 shots at 10 different flying birds, from flocks or individuals. Thats a difficult possibility in rivers, but not uncommon in wheat field in reserve areas. I know of a shooter, know him personally too (a crazy individual who is just in love with geese hunting) who shot 7 or 9 geese from a flock with four shots from his Beretta Xtrema, telling others not to fire at that particular flock. They were sitting across a river area in wheat. He told prior to shooting after analysing the coming flock that this much he will bring down with his 4 shots. But he is a legend, a shooter beyond our category.', ''),

(364198, ' @avais bro, yes passing geese is a great shot skill wise too & is more difficult than the other form. And usually geese shooting as you know is done in wheat fields mostly over decoys, lesser at rivers except Marala. Rivers have mostly passing shots too alongwith total decoyed shots, in which case hitting % drops much. At wheat fields like in USA corn fields, shooting over decoys in a well hidden blind and undisturbed spot, %''s are much higher, and therefore, this season, we heard of much higher scores - I would say maximum in history. I like geese shooting the latter style (wheat fields) and ducks at river sandbars with an open vista which is good therapy for eyes too.', ''),

Here in Punjab actually the load of hunters (shooting traffic) is phenomenally high nowadays.

Shooting accurately with sub 4 inches barrels is not for novice/irregular shooters, may need quite some sessions and as for CZ Duty, well it''s a totally different platform weapon due to slide in frame movement and inherently accurate.

I am feeling jealous from the one who will own it (Greets in advance jokes apart) \n\nfollowing information I''ve learnt from web, several sites;\n\nThe Model IZH-18MH by Baikal has been called one of the most appealing and accurate single shot, break open rifles on the market today. The IZH18MN is true old world craftsmanship. Out of the box dependable and accurate and affordable without sacrificing quality. \n\nIt is noted for easy and reliable handling, high degree of safety, ensured by dependable safety unit and hammer safety lug. High patterning is secured by advanced design of barrel and forend joint, eliminating thermal deformation of barrel, when shooting. Simple and dependable system of bore lock via rocking lever. Trigger action is accommodated in receiver, thus simplifying the design and increasing overall reliability of the gun. Hammer with a "rebound" and a separate spring-loaded striker provide for easy break-opening. Forend and stock of IZH-18H rifles are made of top-quality walnut, beech or birch.\n\nA single-shot break-open rifle using the buttstock, trigger mechanism and up rated action from the IZH-18EM-M single-barrel ejector shotgun now fitted with a high-quality 600mm (23.5") hammer forged barrel. Furniture is stained birch. Iron sights are fitted plus a dovetail scope mount on the barrel. The safety is a non-automatic cross-bolt. These rifles shoot remarkably well and are strong and long-lived making them popular with professional users as working rifles. \n\nFeatures and Specifications: \n\n&#8226; Internal Hammer Design\n&#8226; Tapered Spiral Fluted, \n&#8226; Hammer Forged Chrome Lined Barrel \n&#8226; Cocking Indicator\n&#8226; Walnut Stock and Fore-End &#8226; Cross Bolt Safety\n&#8226; 11mm Scope Rail \n\nMay be available in calibers; .223 Remington .308 Winchester .222 Remington 30-06SPRG \n23.5" hammer forged, chrome lined, spiral fluted, precision barrel \nCocking indicator \nMachined steel receiver \n1" sling swivels and studs \nAdjustable sights \n11mm scope mount \nSynthetic stock \nBlue finish \n39.75" overall length \n6.75 lbs.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Any tips, suggestion. \nI find it now extremely boring to shoot bullseye in a traditional manner.[/QUOTE]\n\nWith a systemic approach, it is easily doable. \nFirst I would get a laser for the hand gun. If it is an older without rail, then you can get barrel laser which can be placed at muzzle.\nPlace a sticky or black piece of paper (2" dia) on the wall and draw from 15ft. You don''t have to full draw, just be off and then aim towards the target and hold. Repeat until you find laser on the target all the times. Do not creep the laser after drawing. As you get better, continue to increase the distance. I have assumed that you are holding the handgun in both hands.\nOnce comfortable at home, then head for the range.\nStart with a target at 5 yards/meter line, this time shoot real bullet. Use normal load. Increase the distance as you improve.', ''),

(364461, 'Black Partridge Competitions Lot has been written about How/Where/When to hunt the partridges.\r\nLet me take you to a different singing word of Black partidges :)\r\n\r\nThe bird is mostly found in the mountains of the Frontier, Punjab, and Balochistan.Black partridge chirping competitions are held throughout Pakistan and thousands of men; young and old take part in them along with their birds. The birds chirp from sunrise to sunset and the most vocal of them are given various prizes. These "All Pakistan Black Partridge Chirping Competitions" are held regularly in cities & towns but the most lively events are the ones held in Kohat, Mianwali, Bhakkar, Peshawar, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan & Lakki Marwat.\r\nLicenses are issued to the participating partridges in these events. This ensures that all these birds have been acquired legally. A single license can cost up to Rs 950 and is valid for a year only. Subsequent renewals cost Rs 60 per year.\r\nThe contestants bring their partridges in bright and colourful cages. Some of these cages can cost in their thousands and are usually hand made. The contests start at 8 in the morning.\r\nAfter the first half hour, there are 10 minute rounds for the birds till 11. Then 5 minute rounds till 2. 2-3 is reserved for lunch & break. By this time, most of the birds have been marked out of the competition and only the "champion" birds are allowed to continue to the next final round which lasts for 1 hour. Any bird that can chirp the most in this 1 hour timeframe will be entrusted the different prizes. The prize constitutes a trophy as well as a cash sum ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 15,000.  Entry of other animals like dogs, cocks & hens, quails, cats, etc. are strictly forbidden within the vicinity of the event.  \r\nA simple event but the most interesting and challenging part of it is counting each call made by the thousands of birds. The birds call simultaneously and it is not possible to tell the birds to be quiet while the others are busy. So a counter is nominated for each participating bird. These counters take an oath before the event that they will do the counting with honesty and sincerity and that if they fraudulate even one call, they will not be considered muslims. 42 judges & 9 referees are appointed to ensure fair play. These judges and referees are appointed from different areas of the country to ensure that they will not take sides.\r\n\r\nBut all this dedication does pay in the end. If a bird is successful in landing a trophy, its popularity fires up and like-minded hobbyists from throughout the country come to see the bird and give the owner due credit. Within minutes, the price of the bird increases manifold from thousands to Lacs. Some of the price-value for the birds rises as far up as 3 Lacs.The bird is then open for bidding by other aspirants. While some of these birds are selt by their owners like hot-cakes, others prefer to keep their birds which they have brought up with so much dedication.', ''),

The ammunition is sealed in metal cans that are hermetically sealed and are packed with desiccants to prevent rust, deterioration, and moisture.\r\n\r\nThe Canned Heat line will include rimfire, rifle, pistol and shotgun ammunition.\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3113[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\n.22 LR (100 or 300 round can in 40 gr. Copper Plated Solid Point) is the only rimfire cartridge offered in a can.\r\n\r\nThe rifle ammunition line currently consists of .223 Remington (30 round can in both the 55 gr FMJBT and 62 gr FMJBT) and .308 Win (20 round can in 150 gr FMJBT).\r\n\r\nThe pistol line includes 9mm (100 round can in 115 gr FMJ, 124 gr FMJBT, and 147 gr FMJ), .40 S&W (100 round can in 170 gr FMJTC and 180 gr FMJFN) and .45 ACP (50 round can in 230 gr FMJ).\r\n\r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]3112[/ATTACH]\r\n\r\nThe Canned Heat Cyalume shotgun ammunition is something special. These 12 Gauge 3/4 oz #8 shot loads include a chemical tracer made by Cyalume. Cyalume manufactures chemical light sticks. The tracer is simply a short light stick that is activated when the round is fired. Unlike conventional tracers it poses no fire hazard. The technology was jointly developed by Cyalume, Fiocchi, General Dynamics and Rheinmetall Defence.\r\n\r\nUnlike the rifle, pistol and rimfire Canned Heat ammunition, the Cyalume shotgun tracers are not in a can for long term storage, but because the glow stick tracers are light sensitive.\r\n\r\nEach can contains 10 rounds of tracers.', ''),

For example in Kohat (a friend went there few yrs back with police backup due to security there, talks a lot about it in terms of black partridge) and a dear friend posted there in the forces now, and himself a hunter, has been having good times on weekends in these last two or three seasons. Here in Punjab actually the load of hunters (shooting traffic) is phenomenally high nowadays. You can come and see the jeeps like bees at opened tehsils in the first 2-3 weekends when partridge opens. But still there are pockets, but need some hard work now – tough long walks and top notch dogs.\r\nAnd you r following good practice of sparing female blacks.

(364531, ' [QUOTE=PakistanFirst;185970]We are familiar with Remington 22LR Yellow Jacket hyper velocity ammunition - 1,500 feet per second at the muzzle. We drool at this kind of stuff. After you read this, see if you still want to drool or change your mind and laugh or pray.\n\nSome time ago, I went deer hunting with a friend. The hunt took us to a forest that was about about 750 miles by vehicle. On the third day of hunt we were deep into the forest, just below the tree line. We had not seen another person all day. We knew the general direction we came from where our pickup was parked on a dirt trail that was use by forest rangers. The sun was setting. Up high where we were, rays of the sun were still visible. Down below us there was no sun.  All day long we had been climbing and going downhill all day long. We were every tired and wanted to sit and rest. We came to a clearing where we found big dead trees lying on the forest floor. I headed toward a big log and my buddy followed. The tree must have been about five feet in diameter. I hopped on to the top and sat down with my rifle against the log. My friend did the same. As I sat on the log and shifted my body to get comfortable, I kicked the log with the heels of my boots. \n\nWith that kick something happened that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I heard a buzz near my ear, then another buzz, then another. With a thump I jumped off the log and to the ground - my  boots first. I flipped my hands toward my ears to ward off what I thoughts were some bugs. We picked up our rifles and decided to find another spot to rest. As we turned around to look for a more comfortable spot, we saw not just bugs but yellow jackets - swarm of them.  \n\nThey were after us. We were racing full speed downhill with our rifles on our shoulders. We were picking speed. The swarm of yellow jackets had the same idea and were going in the same direction - our direction. They too were going downhill and picking up speed. But they were even faster than the Remington Yellow Jackets. We both were wearing short sleeve shirts. The only protection from attack we could think of was to be in the pickup cab. By the time both doors to cab were opened, they - the yellow jackets were with us in the cab and under our shirts. \n\nWe had a choice to make - get out of the cab and quickly throw our shirts on the ground or try take the shirts off inside the cab and counter attack the yellow jackets that were under our shirts. Our split second decision was to counter-attack as the army outside the pickup cab was growing larger. We took off our shirts and killed them all inside the cab. But, they had already unloaded their ammo into our bodies. We could feel the stings. I was mentally calculating the time it would take us to get out of the forest and find a health facility before we become unconscious. I was also worried that the sun had already set and it was getting darker. In our rush to get out of the forest to go for help, we did not want get lost in the winding dirt trails of the forest.\n\nIt must have been about an hour before we left the forest behind and were on a main road. Our bodies that were itchy and burning from stings were starting to cool down. We came to a spot where, if needed, we could call for help. As time passed, we felt relieved that the attack of the yellow jackets had not made unconscious or worst still.\n\nWhenever I pick up a box of 22LR hyper velocity Remington Yellow Jackets, my mind flashes back to the time when we came across missile-speed yellow jackets. \n\nWe went hunting equipped for cut, bruises and snake bites, but not for an attack by an army of yellow jackets. Now the emergency kit includes a supply of antihistamine.[/QUOTE]\n\nTo all hunters\nA.A\n\nthe honey bees are in big quantity \nabout the yellow jackets(kabli dammu) that have a small nest and they are not in big quantity if they are bigger then their stings are very dangerous', ''),

(364539, ' [QUOTE=sights;201315]Lets have some comment on anticipated birds migration to PK.  Can we please share the details of individual bird migration, habitats available, route, timing, limiting and controlling factors?\n\n\n\nI would like to quote an article of SA Shirazi in this regards with few websites of interest.  \n\nAuthor: (S.A.J Shirazi)\nPakistan gets a large number of guest birds from Europe, Central Asian States and India every year. The birds from North spend winters in different wetlands and deserts of Pakistan, which are distributed almost throughout the country, from the high Himalayas to coastal mangroves and mud flats in the Indus delta. And, after winters they go back to their native habitats.\n\nThis famous route from Siberia to various destinations in Pakistan over Karakorum, Hindu Kush, and Suleiman Ranges along Indus River down to the delta is known as International Migratory Bird Route Number 4. It is also called as the Green Route or more commonly Indus Flyway.\n\nEndowed with a remarkable geology, Pakistan spans several of the world’s ecological regions and is spread over broad latitude. The rich Indus delta and the highlands in Pakistan are a great attraction for the guest birds. Which is why the Indus Flyway is one of the busiest in the world.\n\n\nThe birds start on this route in November. February is the peak time and by March they start flying back home. These periods may vary depending upon weather conditions in Siberia and or Pakistan. There are a total of seven identified flyways in the world: from Northern Europe to Scandinavian countries, Central Europe to Mediterranean Sea, Western Siberia to Red Sea, Green Route from Siberia to Pakistan, Ganga Flyway from Eastern Siberia to India, Manchuria to Korea and one from Chakotaka to California. Besides these there are many regionaland smaller routs all over the world.\n\nThe Indus Flyway is important due to the diverse species and large number of birds that take this itinerary: different species of water fowls, cranes, teals, pintail, mallard and gadwall, the list goes on. Some extinguishing species like white-headed duck, houbara bustard and Siberian crane also travel on this route.\n\nAs per an estimate based on regular counts at different Pakistani wetlands, between 700,000 and 1,200,000 birds arrive in Pakistan through Indus Flyway every year. Out of which over 70 per cent of the admirable visitors stay in Thanedar Wala Game Reserve (International Ramsar site number(IRS) 97 where Crane Refuge has also been constructed), Tenda Dam (IRS98), Kinjhar Lakes (IRS 99), Drigh (IRS 100). Haleji Lake (IRS 101) where in the past, over 100,000 migratory birds of more than 222 species had been reported, and which was once called the Bird Watchers’ Paradise by the then president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh), Ucchali Complex (IRS818), Taunsa (IRS 817), Chishma (IRS 816), Rasul, Qadar Abad Barrages, and Lal Sohanra. There are 45 sanctuaries and reserves spread over anarea of about 0.90 million hectares in Sindh alone. Some of the birds that come to our country from northern latitudes arrive at coastal creeks. The remaining birds land up in lakes, which are fondly and proudly maintained by landowners. Only a few places in the world have such plentiful variety of winged life as the wetlands of Pakistan.\n\n\n\n[url]http://pakistaniat.com/2006/11/29/pakistan-birds/[/url]\n[url]http://www.wildlifeofpakistan.com/PakistanBirdClub/birdcomeflyingin.html[/url]\n\nBirds Knowhow  site:\n[url]http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?cid=7&id=14[/url][/QUOTE]\n\nto all the hunters\nA.A\nyou are right but i also want to add some\n\nthe ducks comes in hindo-pak in september and october their routes are afghanistan,chitral\nmostly this is their route they travels mostly in the moon light', ''),

(364590, 'Gun Laws of the world Gun Laws deals with rules, regulations, and restrictions on the use, ownership, and distribution of guns.\r\nHere i am compiling Gun Laws from some of the countries.Your input will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPakistan\r\nPakistani citizens and special category of foreigners can legally own firearms. A license is required to purchase a firearm which involves payment of fees, a processing time ranging from a few days to months and registration of the firearm with the local authorities. Present laws allow ownership of handguns of any caliber (at one time this was restricted to an upper limit of .38-caliber). Shotguns above 12-gauge are not allowed. A civilian permit for a full-automatic weapon may be issued by a local police agency, but typically the firearm may not leave the state in which the permit was issued.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA\r\nU.S. Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment secures an individual right to own and possess handguns in a home for self-defense.Fully automatic firearms are legal in most states, but have requirements for registration and restriction under federal law.\r\n\r\nAustralia\r\nGun ownership is accessible only for those persons with ''genuine reasons'' who can obtain a Permit to Acquire from local Police stations. ''Genuine Reasons'' focus on primary production, licenced sport, animal control or employment requirements, and do not include ''personal protection.''\r\n\r\nBrazil\r\nAll firearms in Brazil are required to be registered with the state. The minimum age for ownership is 25.It is generally illegal to carry a gun outside a residence.\r\n\r\nChina\r\nGun ownership in the People''s Republic of China is heavily regulated by law. Generally, private citizens are not allowed to possess guns. Guns can be used by law enforcement, the military and paramilitary, and security personnel protecting property of state importance.\r\n\r\nIndia\r\nTo obtain a license to own a firearm, a person has to prove that there exists "threat to life."Once a license is obtained, there are several restrictions on caliber (9mm, .303 British .45 ACP are prohibited along with several other calibers) and types of firearms (semiautomatic rifles, short barrel shotguns, and automatic weapons are not allowed for civilians).\r\n\r\nIsrael\r\nIt is forbidden in Israel to own any kind of firearm (including air pistols and rifles) without a special license. Licenses are given only in special circumstances, and most citizens cannot obtain one. Licenses are usually given to ex-high ranking police and military officers, ex-Special Forces enlisted men, people who can demonstrate a high occupational hazard and those who live in areas with a higher risk of terrorist attacks. There is also a limited license for security guards and for hunting purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinland\r\nWeapons are individually licensed by local police forces, however there is no limit on the number of licenses an individual may hold. Licenses are granted for recreational uses, exhibition or (under certain circumstances) professional use.\r\n\r\nFrance\r\nIn France, to buy a weapon, a hunting licence or a shooting sport licence is necessary.\r\n\r\nGermany\r\nA firearms ownership license allows for the purchasing of weapons by those over the age of 18 who meet various competency/trustworthiness guidelines.\r\n\r\nItaly\r\nGun usage is restricted to people 18 years old and up. The number of guns in their homes is not restricted (apart from handguns).\r\n\r\nJapan\r\nThe weapons law begins by stating "No-one shall possess a fire-arm or fire-arms or a sword or swords", and very few exceptions are allowed.The only types of firearms which a Japanese citizen may acquire is a rifle or shotgun. Sportsmen are permitted to possess rifles or shotguns for hunting and for skeet and trap shooting, but only after submitting to a lengthy licensing procedure.Without a licence, a Japanese citizen may not even hold a gun in his or her hands.\r\n\r\nRussia\r\nAccording to Russia''s gun laws, Russian citizens can buy smoothbore shotguns, such as Saiga 12, gas pistols, or revolvers shooting rubber bullets. Safe use of this arsenal for five years allows purchase of a rifle or carbine.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland\r\nSwitzerland practices universal conscription, which requires that all able-bodied male citizens keep fully automatic firearms at home in case of a call-up. Every male between the ages of 20 and 34 is considered a candidate for conscription into the military, and following a brief period of active duty will commonly be enrolled in the militia until age or an inability to serve ends his service obligation.During their enrollment in the armed forces, these men are required to keep their government-issued selective fire combat rifles and semi-automatic handguns in their homes.[45] Up until September 2007, soldiers also received 50 rounds of government-issued ammunition in a sealed box for storage at home.', ''),

During that time Punjab Govt., introduced a reward for wild boar killing i.e. Rs. 75 / (Price of Shaheen SG Box) per wild boar, showing its tail as an evedence for the claim. Believe me our team was the best shooter in District Gujrat and every month we used to kill more than 50 wild boars. Now coming to your query, the technique is very simple. We used to track the footpaths of the wild boars in the jungle (Bela). In local laguage of right bank of the Chenab these tracks are called "Chirak" and the footsteps of the wild boars called "Paira" In the night wild boars comes out of the Bela and attacks to the cultivated fields for their food. After finding  the tracks with lot of wildboars footsteps, we digs a trench 10 to 15 yards away from the track. The size of the trench is normally 8X2X2.5 (L X W X Depth) enough for 3 to 4 shooters to sit and hide inside. One person acts as an O.P. and we rotate this duty throughout the night. Once the O.P. looks the wild boars coming, he alerts the other shooters. And the moment boars crosses in front of shooters imagine ........what happend daz daz dazzzz from so close range.', ''),

My practical experience with Mobil and Optima barrels tells me that if u are out for skeet shoot/Quail Shoot/ Partridge, use optima because it will given u even and bit open spreads...

Thats my guess. But which one @avais bro is using for his A400, he can throw better light on it. My second guess would be "Optima 12" (last option) will fit your model. But just call them to ask, and send back for refund and replacement after they confirm on phone about the specific choke suited to your firearm (A400, 12ga).\r\n\r\nPeople using similar ADJUSTABLE CHOKES here around Lahore (following shows the Truglo model) for their Beretta semi autos:\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.cabelas.com/barrels-chokes-truglo-titan-adjustable-choke-tubes-1.shtml[/url]', ''),

Rifle Shooting as said is indeed a science. \r\n\r\nAll calibers are not "GOOD PERFORMERS" as quoted above. How can a .308 or 30-06 180gr PSP bullet be compared to a 7mm Rem Mag 180gr PSP bullet at any of ranges above 200 yards for example??? A whole world of difference!!! Every caliber has its own FAVORITE/OPTIMUM bullet though. But, distance and TERMINAL ENERGY are two very important factors too to consider one''s caliber (and bullet type) alongwith the bullet expansion feature (how the bullet penetrates and/or mushrooms).\r\n\r\nIn my view, for Pakistan, 270 Win and 7mm Rem Mag .... both top the requirement for ALL game, even Nilgai (150 gr PSP does a very good job, bullet placement is the main issue, and placing on that animal is not tough due to sheer size and relative close range at which it is found). Both calibers are close contesters, though #1 choice is the latter (without doubt), keeping aside the phenominal hike in 7mm Rem Mag bullets.\r\n\r\nNothing beats this combo for Pak game: A good brand 7mm Rem Mag caliber rifle and LPD VX3 2.5-8x scope with a good bullet 150-165gr with high ballistic coefficient. Light weight for mountains requirement is A+ too. However, there is another debate which is not clear to me? 22", 24", 26" length of barrel in it? Which length is best for mountain game (Urial and Him Ibex mainly)?', ''),

(364720, 'New Chemical Tracer Shotgun Shells from Fiocchi Ammunition (VIDEO) Shotgunners of America, rejoice.  Fiocchi Ammunition has just come out with the neatest new training tool ever: Chemical Tracer rounds, part of the Canned Heat line, that are non-toxic, non-pyrotechnic, biodegradable, and safe for any modern shotgun.\r\n\r\n“It’s probably the coolest training aid since the shotgun,” said David Shaw, Fiocchi’s marketing director.  “In the evening it’s orange, and during the day it’s more like a white dot.  It’s visible against a blue sky.”\r\n\r\nThe technology behind Canned Heat is simple; it’s the same stuff light sticks are made from.  Fiocchi partnered with Cyalume Technologies to use their chemiluminescent light technology to create the chemical tracer for shooters.  At this time, the only gauge that’s available is 12-gauge.\r\n\r\n“It’s a 12-gauge shell with Cyalume Tracer and ¾ ounce of number 8 shot,” Shaw said.  Some early shipments will be in boxes, but after that it will be in round cans……literally “canned” ammunition.  Other loads are planned, including #7 ½ and #9.\r\n\r\nThe first Chemical Tracer ammo will be available through Cabela’s, starting about the first of April.  A month or so after that, shooters will be able to find it at any Fiocchi dealer.\r\n\r\nShooters who have seen Chemical Tracer think it’s great, but instructors are ecstatic about it.\r\n\r\n“We shot some Chemical Tracer at the Nationals in San Antonio as a test,” Shaw said.  “Shooters can see it themselves when they’re shooting.  But we’re getting rave reviews from instructors because they can stand behind their students and tell the students whether they’re above or behind the bird, or they need to lead it more or lead it less.”\r\n\r\nChemical Tracer rounds will come in boxes or cans of 10 shells; that’s really all it takes to get a good picture of how you’re shooting.\r\n\r\n“The suggested retail price on the box or can of ten will be $19.99, so it’s about $2 a shot,” Shaw said.  “You’re not going to shoot a whole box of them; you’re only going to shoot a couple of rounds at a time.”\r\n\r\nThat’s when you’re using it for a training aid, however; if you’re shooting it for fun, you may want to buy it by the case.\r\n\r\n“We’ve already seen people who want to shoot it just because it’s fun,” Shaw said.  “The shell has enough shot in it to break a clay target.  The Cyalume Tracer is actually ahead of the shot string, and it stays in the dead center of the shot string out to 30 yards, and with the shot string out to 75 yards.\r\n\r\nWhat’s even cooler than just using it as a training aid is what happens when the shot string hits a clay target; if you break the bird directly with the tracer itself, it lights up in the sky.”\r\n\r\nPersonally, I can’t wait to shoot Fiocchi’s Chemical Tracer rounds.  I’ve been a terrible wingshot my entire shooting career; the idea of actually being able to see what I’m doing wrong pushes my button.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.guns.com/new-chemical-tracer-shotgun-shells-from-fiocchi-ammunition.html[/url]', ''),

(364761, ' Guns are divided into four categories:\r\nCategory A - Forbidden weapons: Pump action shotguns, fully automatic weapons, semi automatic and other rifles when considered military weapons as well as disguised weapons.\r\nCategory B - Weapons requiring permission: Semi automatic long weapons for sporting and hunting, repeating (non-pump action) and semi automatic shotguns and weapons shorter than 60 cm in overall length (i.e. pistols and revolvers). Semi automatic long weapon models are required to be verified as civilian-legal before this category applies to them, otherwise they are considered category A. A permission can either be a hunting license, gun ownership license ("Waffenbesitzkarte", for sporting, collecting and self-defense at home or work) or a carry permit ("Waffenpass", for carrying a loaded weapon outside of the owner''s home or workplace), with the ownership license being the most common way to category B gun ownership.\r\nCategory C - Weapons requiring registration: Break action guns and all repeating rifles (i.e. bolt-, lever- or pump action). All Austrian citizens aged 18 or over can freely buy and own this type of weapon, but ownership has to be registered at a licensed dealer or gunsmith within 6 weeks of purchase.\r\nCategory D - Weapons free from registration: Non-repeating shotguns. Again, every Austrian or EEA citizen at the age of 18+ can buy and own this type of weapon without further registration or permission.', ''),

SiSi: 75%-\r\n3. Lubairs / Himalayan Pigeons : 80%\r\n4. Ducks average for all the species: 33%\r\n5. Snipe 50 %\r\n\r\nI have seen many people who shoot about 70% to 80% on Partridge but I have yet to see a shooter who is greater than 33% on normal flying ducks (Not landing on Decoys). On a good shoot here in Sind there are a lot of ducks, because I don&#8217;t like eating the duck, my father only allowed me 150 cartridges on a shoot and my score was always around 50 ducks, if I manage to fire all 150 shells i.e. 33%.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nBro, in Sind, normally pass shooting is done ... I have one or two experiences (Tando etc) ... this year in Nov-Dec same friends went there from Punjab with a carton shells each person, and literally fired all there in two mornings per shooter (shoots there started post 9am unlike here when shoots starts at civil twilight and ends after 2 hrs). Therefore ducks height and distance is more in Sind where normally ducks come in broad daylight (in full sun) and attain lot of height. You can guess by use of Lt Mod to FULL chokes with #4 load (mostly Super 36g or imported). At least our experience and recent experience of friends was as narrated. Hence, the # of shots fired in the lakes of Sind are normally far greater than what is normally seen here; where at twilight time, over decoys, Improved Cylinder choke is the normally used choke with #6 or #8 cartridge; the cartridge and choke usage explains that too. So 33% in that scenario is a v good %, whereas attaining 50% or plus slightly in the "decoying scenario" like in Punjab is not uncommon. But if a guy who claims around 75-80% at ducks (anywhere), I consider him a super-human :).\r\n\r\nSecondly, I presume you are into regular skeet shooting, probably at pro/competitive level, alongwith regular upland hunting, your good % at upland is thus reflecting that; as skeet/trap alongwith frequent upland shooting ... gives a gr8 boost to shotgunning.\r\n\r\nAnd you are right, it is not uncommon to see many regular old upland shooters getting those upland percentages.', ''),

(364871, ' I dont want to question anyone''s views but here are some facts about wild boar mating. Wild Boar Facts\r\nPart Two\r\nWild Boar Life History & Reproduction\r\n\r\n105. Depending upon the climate and availability of food, the female boar will have one to three breeding cycles per year.\r\n\r\n106. In Italy, the births are concentrated from the end of spring to the end of summer.\r\n\r\n107. Female boar tend to synchronize their cycles in such a way as to raise litters of the same age together and, hence, maximise the possibility of their survival.\r\nWild Boar Facts: Wild boar mating habits\r\n\r\n108. During the mating season, male boar abandon their solitary life and join the sounders. They often cover long distances without stopping for food or rest in order to reach the sounder as soon as possible. No forward planning then!\r\n\r\n109. The first thing a male boar does upon joining the sounder is to remove the young offspring still living with their mothers.\r\n\r\n110. The presence of numerous males within the group generates tensions that are often resolved in violent combat.\r\n\r\n111. During this period the male boar develops an "armour" of cutenaneous and adipose thickening that covers the shoulders until the height of the last rib.\r\n\r\n112. When in combat the male boar butt head against head, parrying the blows with their "armour". This does not, however, prevent the procurement of all lesions, including serious ones.\r\n\r\n113. Before this real combat begins, male boar complete a series of ritual face to face threats with the spraying of urine, the scraping of the ground, the violent knocking of teeth and the frothing of saliva to intimidate their adversaries.\r\n\r\n114. Only if this ritual doesn''t discourage one of the boar, does combat begin.\r\n\r\n115. The winner then commences courtship of the females in the sounder by following the nearest female and emitting a sound similar to the rumble of an internal combustion engine.\r\n\r\n116. When he reaches her he starts to massage her back and flanks with his snout, emitting at the same time rhythmical sounds. The female, when ready to couple, becomes immobile, appears hypnotized, and allows the male to mount her. The coupling lasts about five minutes.\r\n\r\n117. The male boar then repeats the whole courtship ritual with other females within the group - up to eight for the stronger and more vigorous males - until the females breeding cycle comes to an end.\r\n\r\nAt which point he abandons the group until the next time and returns to his solitary life.\r\n\r\n118. The gestation period for the wild boar is up to five months. In Italy, popular expression describes the gestation period as "tre mesi, tre settimane, e tre giorni" - three months, three weeks, and three days.\r\n\r\n119. When the female is near to giving birth - called "farrowing" - she isolates herself from the rest of the sounder to construct a lair within thick vegetation, similar to those constructed as resting places for the night.\r\n\r\n120. The females lair often have openings to the south so as to aid heating of the lair from the suns rays.', ''),

During that time Punjab Govt., introduced a reward for wild boar killing i.e. Rs. 75 / (Price of Shaheen SG Box) per wild boar, showing its tail as an evedence for the claim. Believe me our team was the best shooter in District Gujrat and every month we used to kill more than 50 wild boars. Now coming to your query, the technique is very simple. We used to track the footpaths of the wild boars in the jungle (Bela). In local laguage of right bank of the Chenab these tracks are called "Chirak" and the footsteps of the wild boars called "Paira" In the night wild boars comes out of the Bela and attacks to the cultivated fields for their food. After finding  the tracks with lot of wildboars footsteps, we digs a trench 10 to 15 yards away from the track. The size of the trench is normally 8X2X2.5 (L X W X Depth) enough for 3 to 4 shooters to sit and hide inside. One person acts as an O.P. and we rotate this duty throughout the night. Once the O.P. looks the wild boars coming, he alerts the other shooters.

(364964, ' [COLOR="red"][B][B][B][COLOR="red"][/COLOR][/B]	\r\n9mm Versus .45 Caliber: Does Size Really Matter?\r\nPosted: July 5, 2010 by joebarrett in Gun Choice, Uncategorized[/B][/B][/COLOR]\r\n\r\nThe debate between 9mm and .45 has raged for years, and I am not foolish enough to think that I can settle it for everyone, but I would like to weigh in. Some of you may be complaining already ‘Not this again,’ but from the point of view of a former .45acp-only guy, let me tell you where my experiences have led me and why I’ve changed my opinion on the matter completely.\r\n\r\n I carried full size Colt 1911 .45acp pistols exclusively for most of my armed history.  That was the round my Dad said was the best, so that was that for me.  Over the years whenever the 9mm was mentioned as a defensive round, my position was always: “If you have nothing else, a 9mm is better than nothing.  However, 9mm is the weakest round I recommend for self- defense.”  This was based mostly upon what I’d always believed and the stories from GI’s reporting multiple shots needed to bring down an enemy combatant when using the Beretta M9 9mm pistol.  What more do you need?  Actual battlefield reports brought the matter to a close as far as I was concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen Trigger Time with Joe Barrett was born I began working on a list topics of conversation for the show.  I thought the 9mm debate would be a good one.  However, since I knew I would actually be talking on air and not just at my kitchen table, I wanted to do some up to date research to support my .45 acp superiority,  just in case I met with any opposition.  And, I did just that, I researched and right about the time this research was all but complete I enrolled in Handgun 1-5 at Tactical Defense Institute in West Union Ohio.  There I was able to use my 1911 .45&#8242;s and Glock .40 cals in actual real-world shooting scenarios to see how they would perform for me when and if I ever needed them.\r\n\r\nOne thing I learned quickly is that when you are under stress and shooting, you tend to fire more rounds.  In fact, many people forced to defend themselves with a gun empty their first mag in the initial exchange. My 8 round 1911 had me making mag changes nearly 3 times as often as others shooting alongside me.  I didn’t like that at all, so I switched to my .40 caliber glock for the next two days of class.  That took care of the frequent reloading, but I noticed a difficulty in staying on target with rapid follow-up shots.  I found that most .40 cal pistols are just frames for a 9mm with a barrel that allows for the larger round.  So, unlike the heavy 1911, you have less weight to absorb the added recoil you get with a .40 over a 9mm. \r\n\r\nThis training taught me that you need to shoot fast and accurate under less than perfect conditions, such as moving, with a flashlight in hand to see, and with people shooting back. They don’t call them “desperate circumstances” for nothing.  A well lit firing range is probably not where you’re really going to need your pistol skills and the training I took foccused on  preparing me for things like moving through my house at night and dealing with armed intruders. My goal during these exercises was to get as many rounds into vital areas as I could.  When you consider that the average gunfight is over in less than 3 seconds, how many ½ seconds can you to lose to re-acquiring your sight picture?  More recoil means more time re-acquiring your sight picture.  Math has never been my strong suit but it didn’t take me long to realize that fast and accurate is easier with less recoil.  So, when I finished Handgun 1-3 and returned a couple of weeks later for Handgun 4 and 5, I brought a 9mm. \r\n\r\n My eyes were opened.  I found I could fire faster and keep all my rounds in a very confined space much better with the 9mm than I could the .40 or the .45.  No doubt, as far as performance went, the 9mm was the gun for me.  The only problem was that voice in the back of my mind, my voice saying, “But what about the weaker stopping power of the 9mm?” I spent a lot of years listening to that voice and shooting .40 & .45 almost exclusively.  I was a firm believer in the notions that “With a .45 or .40 you only need to hit once,” and “You want to stop an aggressor, not just make him angry.”  Besides, would Harry Callahan’s words “Go ahead, make my day” have had the same impact if he had been holding a 9mm?  If you’re a .45 or .40 cal person you probably have a similar voice that’s been keeping your hands off the 9mm for protection. \r\n\r\nWell, I decided to do a strange thing; I decided to ignore that voice for long enough to listen to the men who actually rely upon their guns to stay alive.  SWAT operatives and Police trainers had actually done a considerable amount of research.  I took advantage of their research based upon hundreds of autopsies attended, hundreds of interviews with persons who’ve actually been involved in shootings, and studies done where various rounds were fired into animals with similar tissue and bone density to humans. It was more than talk, it was real-life experience, I just needed to listen. \r\n\r\n Then I did my own research and found something amazing: A 127 grain Winchester Ranger +P+ fired into bare ballistic gelatin will impact at 1210 feet per second, penetrate 12-14 inches, and expand to right around .70 inches.  My favorite .45 ammo, Federal Hydra-shocks, will impact the same gelatin at a slower 800 feet per second, penetrate 12-14 inches and expand to right around .70 inches.  Wait a minute, it sounds like these two rounds would pretty much cut the same wound path, right?  This information supported what I’d been told by another group that conducted ammo test of pigs:  You cannot tell a decent 9mm wound path from a decent .45 wound path.\r\n\r\n If the rounds are going to do the same damage, why not use the one that affords me 19 pulls of the trigger without a reload instead of 8?  As it turns out, those battlefield reports from ex-military guys using the 9mm in combat actually tell me more about military pistol training than the power of the 9mm.  The Army does not give the soldier nearly the pistol training that they do the rifle, so the problem is that many of these reported hits are not in vital areas and that is the problem, not the size of the ammunition itself.  On top of that, the standard military 9mm ammo is what you and I use for target practice, NOT self-defense.   That’s right, soldiers are issued standard FMJ hardball; now the clouds are really beginning to part! \r\n\r\n The fact of the matter is that the 9mm vs .45 debate will rage on because we have science battling tradition, and neither will ever give up.  For me, I concluded that it just comes down to a question of ammunition and shot placement.  If you use the right 9mm ammo, you’ll get as much tissue damage as you would from a similar .45acp.  That means my 9mm, if used correctly, will have the same stopping power as my old .40 cal.  In fact, since I now know that I can shoot faster and more accurately with my 9mm, my stopping power is greater with a 9mm and that is what I really care about.  But, if you are most comfortable and can perform to your satisfaction with a .40 or.45, then use them.  Both are a fine round.  For me, I found that I could do better with a 9mm, have more rounds at hand and expect the same results with well-placed shots, so I made the leap. \r\n\r\n Maybe it’s just that there is no “better” round in the 9mm vs .45 arenas, and we all just love a good debate.  But, one thing we all know for sure is that if you’re ever in a position to have to defend yourself or others you’re going to have seconds to respond and there will be no time for debate.  So, get the training necessary to allow you to get your rounds, whatever they are, on target fast.  Do that and the caliber of your pistol really won’t matter as much as you think.', ''),

Test a few reloaded slugs out of a fully rifled bore slug barrel and a smooth bore slug barrel.\n2. To have one hell of a fun day in the process.\n\nAnyways, the day like any other day in Sialkot with Denovo87 Bhai was full of fun, joy and happiness. One thing that I must insist that Denovo87 Bhai''s "to die for" company is second to none and the full of knowledge and experience and insightful type company of Avais bhai is beyond words.\n\nHere are the pictures of range testing that we did of reloaded slugs. the slugs were casted by our member Rotorcrafts.

You don''t have to full draw, just be off and then aim towards the target and hold. Repeat until you find laser on the target all the times. Do not creep the laser after drawing. As you get better, continue to increase the distance.

(365004, ' francolino banned for a week . He is at it again, trying to pick a fight.\r\n\r\nW.A,\r\nNo, you are mistaken @mian-CH. I think in our circles nobody knows you remotely. Just a few friends bought earlier your decoys marked M.S&#8230; and many broke after half a season with (60%) paint worn out after 3 uses. This I quoted and I think it has made you depressed. I also said that I went to a corner shop ahead of PARA (at Nila Gmbd Lhr) and saw your decoys st Rs700 per pair, and there was a shop Iqbal Ishaq selling local ones too at around Rs600 per pair. So I made the analysis that instead of hunters buying local ones with limited life, is it not better for hunters and us here to buy IMPORTED ones out of either Avery GHG, Flambeau, Higdon or Carrylite, for example the Higdon ones at about Rs.400 per piece, or Rs800 per pair available in the market since last few months??? Just an addition of Rs100 bucks gives you much better deal&#8230;.. And I think again it made you depressed!! &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; And out of depression I think came your outburst that you let your steam out on Tigers, Ibexes, Urials, V.Wild Boars, Jackals, Porcupines; In a matter of weeks, you hunted all these animals, or did you hunt them earlier?? We are very much confused over this?\r\n\r\nActually I was tying to appreciate your Big Game hunts of Tigers, Ibexes and Urials as well really dangerous game as v.wild boar, jackals & porcupines. Khanewal incident is an example how dangerous these animals can be. But it is sure a pity that the beast was killed before any professional hunters went their for the final kill to make the lives of locals there safer. If you look at my post again, and also see other people&#8217;s posts having IMMENSE interest in your &#8216;Big Game&#8217; kills. It seems you have not left any species un-hunted, which is a formidable task &#8211; nobody would have that kind of hunting resume, believe me &#8230;. Therefore I said Hats Off!! Bravo! &#8230;. Did I say anything wrong?\r\n\r\nSo, everybody is here keeping there fingers crossed that when you would be showing those trophies to us; where you placed the bullet, what caliber did you use, did you use a special bullet for that and what was tracking method and place of hunt; so us all can learn some &#8216;deadly animal hunting&#8217; tips from you&#8230;&#8230; Did I ask a difficult task from you &#8230;.. Did I say anything wrong?\r\n&#8230;.. You are doubting my sincerity, which upsets me indeed  !!!\r\n\r\nHopefully (we pray) you would soon give us the good news about recovery of those pictures of Tiger/Ibexes/Urials hunts from your computer files,,,,,,   .... because as you said above: "You will get all the pictures according to your desire and i have explained through true stories in my posts, i always explains true stories, it is a weapon of man''s honour." I think your honour is truly now at stake!!\r\n\r\nTake care mian-CH &#8230; brother, & do try to conserve some left young boars which are next to extinction already, for the future hunting generations too. I hope you don&#8217;t at least do the same with this plea: &#8216;Ek kaan se suno, doosre se nikal do&#8217;, as above you said, because the future of hunting rests on elder senior shikaris like you now because you are the role models of next generations.', ''),

I fired a few hundred rounds and it regained l remained perfectly fine. All the guns that went kaboom were at high pressure ammo. I saw one such caracal myself. High pressure ammo can cause any gun to go kaboom be it beretta or anything else. I recently saw a kaboom with a friend of mine. I''ll start a thread of it in a few days when I''ll have time. All due to ammo. \r\nRegarding the dropping issue kan sahab u''ve tested you gun and addy different angles. It didn''t go off. I carried my caracal also. There is no case reported of caracal firing when dropped. There was a safety concern and recall. But no case had emerged until now despite alot of people testing their gun just like you. \r\nI believe it''s being blown up beyond proportions and your gun is safe. \r\nCaracal is a lovely gun and enjoy using it.

(365229, ' [QUOTE=avais;203326]Brother I used this techniquue for 10 years the old days when i did not had the jeep. During that time Punjab Govt., introduced a reward for wild boar killing i.e. Rs. 75 / (Price of Shaheen SG Box) per wild boar, showing its tail as an evedence for the claim. Believe me our team was the best shooter in District Gujrat and every month we used to kill more than 50 wild boars. Now coming to your query, the technique is very simple. We used to track the footpaths of the wild boars in the jungle (Bela). In local laguage of right bank of the Chenab these tracks are called "Chirak" and the footsteps of the wild boars called "Paira" In the night wild boars comes out of the Bela and attacks to the cultivated fields for their food. After finding  the tracks with lot of wildboars footsteps, we digs a trench 10 to 15 yards away from the track. The size of the trench is normally 8X2X2.5 (L X W X Depth) enough for 3 to 4 shooters to sit and hide inside. One person acts as an O.P. and we rotate this duty throughout the night. Once the O.P. looks the wild boars coming, he alerts the other shooters. And the moment boars crosses in front of shooters imagine ........what happend daz daz dazzzz from so close range.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nsir i never went for any wild boar hunt in my life.....seen mostly on screen.... i was thinking the following after reading your above post:\r\nAs you mentioned this trench digging technique isn''t it bit dangerous? if a boar charges after your firing and jumps right into the trench ? then what happens? \r\n\r\nIsn''t a "machan"on higher side may be the tree/rock is a safer option?\r\n\r\nNeed your expert view about this just for my knowledge... may be i am thinking as per my perception?\r\nregards', ''),

(365322, 'Brief History of Pistols / Handguns [B]Multiple senses of the word "pistol"\r\n[/B]\r\nThe word "pistol" is often synonymous with the word "handgun". Some handgun experts make a technical distinction that views pistols as a subset of handguns. Sometimes in American usage, the term "pistol" refers to a handgun whose chamber is integral with the barrel, making pistols distinct from the other main type of handgun, the revolver, which has a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers. But UK/Commonwealth usage often does not make this distinction. For example, the official designation of the Webley Mk VI was "Pistol, Revolver, Webley No. 1 Mk VI", and the designation "Pistol No. 2 Mk I" was used to refer to both the Enfield Revolver and the later Browning Hi-Power semi-automatic.\r\n\r\nHandheld firearms were first made in China where gunpowder was first developed. They were hand cannons (although they were not necessarily fired from the hand, but rather at the end of a handle). By the 14th century, they existed in Europe as well. The first handheld firearms that might better be called "pistols" were made as early as the 15th century, but their creator is unknown. By the 18th century, the term came to be used often to refer to handheld firearms. Practical revolver designs appeared in the 19th century, but it was not until the mid-twentieth century that the (sometimes-observed) differentiation in usage of the words "pistol" and "revolver" evolved among some speakers and the use of "handgun" became prevalent. Previously there had been no such differentiation, and in fact Samuel Colt''s original patent was for a "revolving-breech pistol." There is no literal equivalent for "handgun" in the Romance languages, which continue to use cognates of the word "pistol".\r\n\r\n\r\nEtymology of "pistol"\r\nHand cannon from the Chinese Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368).\r\nThe word "pistol" is derived from the French pistole (or pistolet), which has these possible origins:\r\n\r\nFrom the Czech pistole and this one from the Czech píš&#357;ala (flute or pipe, referring to the shape of a Hussite firearm), from Middle High German pischulle or from Middle French pistole.\r\n\r\nFrom the city of Pistoia, Italy, where hand-held guns (designed to be fired from horseback) were first produced in the 1540s.\r\n\r\nThat early pistols were carried by cavalry in holsters hung from the pommel (or pistallo in medieval French) of a horse''s saddle.', ''),

(365325, ' MOST= ASKED SHOTGUN QUESTION \r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1 \r\nAre Magnum Loads Faster Than Standard Field Loads?\r\nI have been told that I will have to lead a duck more when using a standard field load than when using a magnum load because the latter is loaded to higher velocity. How much faster are magnum shotshells?\r\n\r\nUnlike magnum centerfire rifle cartridges, which are usually faster than standard cartridges, magnum shotshells of all gauges are often slower than regular field loads. Use of the word magnum in shotshell terminology refers to a heavier shot charge and not necessarily an increase in speed. As examples, Remington''s 12-gauge 2 3/4-inch Premier Magnum turkey load has 1 1/2 ounces of shot and a 1260 fps muzzle velocity rating while Remington''s standard Game Load delivers 1/4 ounce less shot but is rated at a quicker 1330 fps. Moving on up in payload size, respective shot charge weights of the Premier Magnum loadings of the three-inch and 3 1/2-inch 12-gauge Magnum shells are two and 2 1/4 ounces respectively while their muzzle velocities are only 1175 and 1150 fps respectively. It all has to do with the maximum chamber pressures within which the ammunition makers must work, and when light and heavy shot charges are loaded to the same pressures, the latter will be lower in velocity.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 \r\nWhat Is A Shot Tower?\r\nThe gunshop owner from whom I recently bought some No. 8 lead shot made by Winchester said it was formed in a shot tower. What is a shot tower?\r\n\r\nWhen free-falling through the air, the surface tension of any liquid, whether it be water from a rain cloud or a molten metal like lead, causes each droplet to become spherical in shape. In the making of shot, molten lead is poured into a large pan, the bottom of which is full of small holes. The size of these holes determines the size of the shot. As the pan is vibrated droplets of lead fall through the air and land in a pool of water where they are cooled with little to no deformation. Since it was once thought that the formation of uniformly round lead droplets required a drop through the air of 150 feet or so, the process took place in a tall structure commonly referred to as a shot tower. Some shot manufacturers still use shot towers while others use the Bleimeister process in which the lead droplets fall only a few feet.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 \r\nCan Choke Be Measured With A Coin? \r\nAt a recent gun show I observed an old gentleman placing a coin in the muzzle of a 12-gauge shotgun and pronouncing it as having a Full choke. Can the choke constriction really be measured with a coin?\r\n\r\nSome shotgunners believe the amount of choke in a barrel can be determined by simply measuring its inside diameter at the muzzle, but this has never been true (and it never will be true unless all manufacturers decide to get together and start making barrels of the same gauge with a common bore diameter). The amount of choke constriction in a barrel is the difference between its bore diameter and the constriction at its muzzle; the best way to measure both is with a special dial caliper (available from Brownells, Dept. ST, 200 S. Front St., Montezuma, IA 50171). Bore diameter can vary considerably among the various manufacturers, and the same holds true for muzzle constriction for a given choke designation. Taking the 12 gauge as an example, while standard bore diameter is supposed to be in the neighborhood of .729 to .730 inch, barrels from various makers can range anywhere from .720 to .735 inch, and those that have been backbored can be even larger. Assuming that the correct amount of constriction for, say, Full choke for the 12 gauge is .040 inch, it is easy to see how actual inside diameter at the muzzle can vary from .680 to .695 inch for that designation.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 \r\nWhat''s The Most Common Mistake Made By Inexperienced Shotgunners In Choosing Equipment?\r\nWhen it comes to choosing the right equipment, what single mistake is an inexperienced shotgunner most likely to make?\r\n\r\nI''d say choosing more choke than is actually required for a specific application is the single most common mistake made by those who are new to shotgunning. In many parts of the U.S. (and the world for that matter), a very large percentage of aerial targets are taken inside 25 yards; for this reason most shooters would miss fewer birds if they chose one of the more open chokes such as Skeet or Improved Cylinder. In addition to averaging a lower number of shells per bird, those hunters would also damage the meat of fewer of the birds they do hit. Other applications do require tighter chokes, but the beginning shotgunner who starts out with less choke than he thinks he needs and then works up to tighter chokes as required is a lot better off than one who starts the game with an extremely tight choke. The chart below shows the approximate diameters of patterns produced by various common chokes at several ranges; it should give you an idea of how difficult it is to hit close-range targets with extremely tight chokes.\r\n\r\nChoke Pattern Diameter\r\nApproximate Pattern Diameter (Inches)\r\nChoke	\r\n10 Yards\r\n20 Yards\r\n25 Yards\r\n30 Yards\r\n40 Yards\r\nSpreader	\r\n23\r\n37\r\n44\r\n51\r\n66\r\nCylinder	\r\n20\r\n32\r\n38\r\n44\r\n57\r\nImproved\r\nCylinder	\r\n15\r\n26\r\n32\r\n38\r\n51\r\nModified	\r\n12\r\n20\r\n26\r\n32\r\n46\r\nFull	\r\n9\r\n16\r\n21\r\n26\r\n40\r\nNo. 5\r\nDoes The 12 Gauge Shoot A Bigger Pattern?\r\nHow much larger in diameter is the pattern thrown by a 12-gauge gun than a 20-gauge gun with the same choke?\r\n\r\nEverything including the degree of choke constriction being the same, gauge has nothing to do with pattern size. At any given distance patterns from the 10, 12, 16, 20, 28, and .410 will measure approximately the same diameter so long as they are choked the same. The only exception is when extremely soft shot is used. Smaller bores sometimes throw slightly larger patterns with extremely soft shot due to a higher level of pellet deformation during firing, but the difference is seldom great enough to make a difference in the field.\r\n\r\nNo. 6\r\nIs One Trigger Better Than Two?\r\nWhen I was a youngster practically every double-barrel shotgun I saw had two triggers, but most of the newer models made today have a single trigger. Is one better than two?\r\n\r\nSome shotgunners have a specific preference between single and double triggers while others use either with equal satisfaction. I regularly use doubles with both types, and even though I would just as soon have one as the other, I do recognize that each has slight advantages. While pull length always remains the same with a single trigger, it is longer for the front trigger than for the rear trigger on a gun with two triggers. This seems to bother some shooters. Barrel selection can be a bit quicker with two triggers, but their biggest advantage as I see it comes when hunting flushing birds such as quail. On a number of occasions I have fired one barrel at a single bird and then had a second one flush while my gun was broken down for reloading. A double gun with two triggers can be closed on an empty chamber and the bird quickly taken with the second barrel by simply squeezing its trigger. If this is done while hunting with a gun equipped with a single trigger, the barrel selector has to be switched prior to pulling the trigger in order to fire the loaded barrel, making it a bit slower to get back into action. The advantage of a double-trigger gun in the field is slight, but it is there just the same.\r\n\r\nNo. 7\r\nWill Copper-Plated Shot Damage An Old Shotgun Barrel?\r\nI have a very nice old Winchester Model 21 double and would like to try factory ammo with copper-plated shot. I have been told that type of shot is harder than plain lead shot and might damage the barrels of my gun. Do you agree? What types of shot are safe to use in my Model 21?\r\n\r\nThe antimony content of shot is what determines its degree of hardness, and copper plating serves only to prevent surface oxidation of the shot and to make it pretty. Nickel plating does increase shot hardness a bit, but even it is not hard enough to cause any damage to the barrels of your Model 21. Any type of lead shot, whether it be plated or nonplated, is suitable for use in old doubles like yours. Three of the nontoxic shot types now readily available-tungsten-matrix, tungsten polymer, and\r\nbismuth-are also suitable for use in your Model 21.\r\n\r\nNo. 8\r\nHow Do I Become A Better Wingshot?\r\nI have long taken great pride in my marksmanship with a rifle, but wingshooting gives me fits. What rules would help me become more proficient with a shotgun?\r\n\r\nThe two most common mistakes inexperienced shotgunners make are lifting the head from the stock as they fire and stopping the swing as the trigger is squeezed. Keeping your cheek glued to the stock as the gun fires is an absolute must as failing to do so will usually cause you to shoot over the target. Stopping your swing just as you pull the trigger will cause you to shoot behind the target. Other rules are important, but learning to keep your head down and pulling the trigger as the muzzle swings through the target will go a long way toward making you a better wingshot. If you have a gun club nearby, you will likely find an experienced skeet shooter there who will be happy to instruct you in the fundamentals of shotgunning. You might also want to consider attending one of the many shotgun schools and clinics held across the country each year. I highly recommend the Remington Shooting School, and you can obtain rates as well as a location schedule by calling 1-800-742-7053.\r\n\r\nNo. 9\r\nWhat Is Backboring?\r\nI keep seeing the term backboring used in describing shotgun barrels, but I''m not sure I fully understand what it means. Can you explain it and any benefit it offers?\r\n\r\nAlso called overboring, backboring simply means that the bore diameter of a barrel exceeds what has long been the industry standard. Depending on whose chart you believe, .729 to .730 inch is standard for the 12 gauge while the bore diameter of a backbored barrel usually measures from .735 to .740 inch and sometimes a bit larger. As for any major benefit, some shooters are convinced that backboring along with lengthening of the forcing cone of a barrel reduces recoil, and while I don''t believe this has been proven to be true scientifically, I am sold on the concept. The idea of backboring a shotgun barrel is a very old one, but it did not prove to be entirely practical until the introduction of the modern plastic wad with a flanged overpowder cup capable of obturating sufficiently to seal off the oversized bore.\r\n\r\nNo. 10\r\nIs A Straight Or Curved Grip Best?\r\nWhile shopping for a new shotgun I noticed that several are available with either a curved or a straight grip. I prefer the looks of the straight-grip guns but have never tried that style. Which is best?\r\nLike many features seen on various types of firearms, choosing between a straight or curved grip boils down more to individual preference than anything else. I prefer the curved grip for shooting clay target games such as skeet, trap, and sporting clays because it allows for more uniform positioning of the hand from shot to shot. The straight grip (or straight hand as the English call it) is often touted as the best choice for a double with two triggers since it allows the hand to move more smoothly from one trigger to the other when shooting. While this might be true for some shotgunners, I find that I shoot equally well afield with either style. Two of my favorite upland game guns are a Westley Richards side-by-side double with two triggers and straight grip and an L.C. Smith double with dual triggers and a curved grip. Just for the fun of it I sometimes start a hunt with one and finish up with the other, but I find my shells per bird average to be the same regardless of which gun I use.\r\n\r\nA straight grip does tend to cause the trigger-hand elbow to be held higher as the gun is mounted, and while it is believed by some that this discourages lifting of the head when shooting (a common cause of misses), I find missing about as easy with one type of stock as the other. Perhaps the best thing the straight grip has going for it is its looks; to my eye a fine side-by-side double with twin triggers, straight-grip stock, and splinter forearm is one of the most handsome of all firearms.', ''),

If this is true, the performance of short shells must be awful in guns with 3 1/2-inch chambers. Do you agree?\r\nThrough the years I have pattern-tested enough short shells in long chambers to become convinced that the information you have received is more speculation than fact. Only a few weeks ago I fired several 12-gauge 2 1/2-inch and 2 3/4-inch loads in an autoloader with a three-inch chamber, and the patterns they produced were just as uniform as those shot with three-inch shells. I then took the experiment another step by firing those three shell lengths in another shotgun with a 3 1/2-inch chamber and could tell no difference in pattern quality than when 3 1/2-inch shells were used. I have also experienced the same results with other gauges. Sometime back I bought a 1930s-vintage 20-gauge double with 2 1/2-inch chambers and pattern tested it with shells of that length made by the British firm of GameBore. I then had the chambers of the gun lengthened to 2 3/4 inches, and pattern quality with those same shells remained the same when fired in the longer chambers. The 2 1/2-inch shells also produced beautiful patterns when fired in a 20-gauge gun with three-inch chambers.\r\n\r\nNo. 12\r\nIf A Three-inch Shell Fits In My Gun''s 2 3/4-Inch Chamber, Can I Fire It Safely With The Longer Shells?\r\nThe barrel of my 12-gauge shotgun is marked for 2 3/4-inch shells only, yet a three-inch shell will easily slip into its chamber. Does this mean it is safe to shoot three-inch shells in my gun?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely not. The linear dimension used to identify a particular shotshell refers to the length of its fired case and not that of the loaded round. Actual length will vary slightly among various brands of shells, but those designated as 2 3/4 inches usually measure around 2 5/16 inches before firing and 2 5/8 to\r\n2 11/16 inches after firing. Three-inch shells usually measure from 2 1/2 to 2 5/8 inches before firing and lengthen to just under three inches when fired. Since the 2 3/4-inch chamber of a shotgun will usually measure at least that long, and sometimes slightly longer, you can see how an unfired three-inch shell will drop right into it. Firing shells of excessive length for the chamber can generate dangerously high pressures for the following reason: The inside diameter of a shotgun barrel rapidly becomes smaller just forward of the front end of the chamber in an area called the forcing cone. When a three-inch shell is fired in a 2 3/4-inch chamber, its crimp section opens into the forcing cone and in doing so effectively reduces bore diameter at that point. If the shot charge and wad column are required to squeeze through this partial obstruction, chamber pressure can increase.\r\n\r\nNo. 13\r\nWhich Chokes Are Most Useful?\r\nSometime back I received a brochure from a maker of aftermarket screw-in chokes and am amazed at the mind-boggling number of constrictions available. If you had to boil them all down to the most useful for wingshooting and clay target shooting with a 12-gauge gun, what would they be?\r\n\r\nLet''s take clay targets first. For 16-yard trap I prefer either Improved Cylinder or Light Modified, and when shooting trap doubles I use one of those in the bottom barrel of my over/under and Modified up top. Modified also works fine for handicap shooting back to the 20-yard line, but beyond that I would switch to Improved Modified or Full. When shooting regular skeet I prefer Cylinder or Skeet choke, and for sporting clays either of those along with Light Modified for the more distant targets and perhaps Modified for clay rabbits beyond 30 yards will get the job done.\r\n\r\nNow for field work. When hunting birds that hold tight for a good pointing dog (preserve quail, pheasant, and chukar are good examples), I prefer Skeet in one barrel and Improved Cylinder in the other of a double gun. If I had to pick just one for a single-barrel gun, I''d go with Skeet. What you have just read also applies to mountain grouse. Increase ranges a bit for a combination of both close- and wild-flushing birds, and I''ll take Improved Cylinder and Modified; if I had to make do with one, it would be the Improved Cylinder. Improved Cylinder will also handle doves out to 25 yards while longer shots on those birds will usually require Light Modified. When hunting extremely spooky birds that flush way out yonder, anything from Improved Modified to Full often proves to be none too tight.\r\n\r\nIf push came to shove, I could get by with fewer chokes, but you asked for what I consider to be optimum rather than minimum.\r\n\r\nNo. 14\r\nAre Clay Target Games Good Practice For Hunting?\r\nA gun club in my area offers trap, skeet, and sporting clays, but a friend I hunt with says neither game has any value as far as making me a better shot in the field is concerned. He says there are clay target shooters and there are hunters, and the only thing the two have in common is their guns go "bang." What do you say?\r\n\r\nI say your friend should give clay target shooting a try before voicing an opinion. Perfection is impossible to achieve without practice, and few hunting seasons or game bag limits are generous enough to allow us a great deal of time for that. While some of the shots presented in the clay target games (such as the springing teal of sporting clays) are seldom encountered in the field, even those shots offer an excellent way to learn the fundamentals of shotgunning. I''ll put it this way: Of the top skeet and sporting clays shooters I know, each and every one who hunts is also an excellent shot in the field. I''m also convinced that shooting clay targets during the off-season makes me a far better shot in the field.\r\n\r\nNo. 15\r\nAre High-Brass Hulls Stronger Than Low-Brass? \r\nIt would appear to me that high-brass shells are stronger than low-brass shells. Assuming this to be true, which brand should I shoot in my old Winchester Model 12?\r\n\r\nAll manufacturers load shotshells of the various types to similar chamber pressure levels, and how high the brass extends up on the body of the case has absolutely no bearing on strength. Modern plastic hulls are strong enough to withstand the relatively low chamber pressures to which shotshells are loaded even if they have no brass at all. The ACTIV hull, which is of virtually all-plastic construction, is a good example of how true this is; the only metal it contains is a thin disc imbedded in its head to prevent the extractor of a gun from ripping through its thin plastic rim. High-brass hulls, low-brass hulls, no-brass hulls, there really is no practical difference in their ability to withstand chamber pressures during firing.\r\n.\r\nNo. 16\r\nShould I Handload Shotshells?\r\nI own shotguns in 12, 20, 28, and .410 and am trying to decide if I should start reloading my shells. What do you think?\r\n\r\nWhether or not reloading shotshells is worthwhile from a purely practical point of view boils down to only two factors: cost and the need for specialty loads not available in factory-loaded ammunition. If your shotgunning is limited to hunting and perhaps no more than a few rounds of skeet each year to sharpen your eye for the upcoming season, it might be difficult to justify purchasing the equipment needed even if it is nothing more than the least expensive single-stage reloader available. On the other hand, if in addition to hunting you also burn up a lot of shells on clay targets, you probably can''t afford not to reload.\r\n\r\nHaving the option of reloading will also allow you to cook up any specialty loads needed. For example, my 20-gauge Westley Richards quail gun was built back in the 1930s, so I treat it kindly by feeding it nothing heavier than 3/4 ounce of shot and 11.5 grains of Hodgdon''s International Clays for a muzzle velocity of 1100 fps. Recoil is quite comfortable, chamber pressure averages a mild 8000 psi, and the load drops bobwhites like a laser. This is basically a 28-gauge equivalent load not available in factory-loaded form, and only by handloading am I able to shoot it.\r\n\r\nNo. 17\r\nFor What Applications Are Manual And Automatic Safeties Best Suited?\r\nI have noticed that the safeties of several modern over/under doubles, with the Remington Peerless and Ruger Red Label as examples, can be set internally for either manual or automatic operation. For what applications are the two modes best suited?\r\n\r\nMost clay target shooters prefer a nonautomatic safety and one that is blocked to prevent it from being pushed to the "On" position. A blocked safety is okay in competitive shooting where the gun is never loaded until the shooter steps to the firing point, but such a safety should never be used in the field. I prefer manual safeties on all my guns whether they be used for competitive shooting or the field, but when using one for hunting I keep its safety "On" until I am in the act of actually firing the gun. Hunters of lesser experience with double-barrel shotguns are probably better off with a safety that automatically returns to the "On" position when the top lever is thumbed to the side for loading, although some might argue this point since autoloaders and pump guns do not have automatic safeties.\r\n\r\nNo. 18\r\nWill A Bigger, Brighter Front Sight Help?\r\nThe barrel of my shotgun has a relatively small bead up front. If I have a larger one installed, will it help me to shoot more quail and pheasant with fewer shells?\r\n\r\nProbably not. A large front bead is good to have on a shotgun used for hunting turkeys because the gun is usually aimed at a gobbler while it is standing on the ground in order to concentrate the dense center of the shot pattern on its head and neck areas. On the other hand, when a shotgun is properly used for wingshooting, it is pointed and fired instinctively and not aimed. In other words, the shooter really should not be conscious of whether or not the barrel actually has a bead.\r\n\r\nNo. 19\r\nHow Can I Use My Damascus-Barreled Shotgun In The Field Without Handloading Blackpowder Loads?\r\nAn old Parker 12-gauge shotgun I have is in excellent condition, but a gunsmith tells me I should shoot only blackpowder loads in its Damascus barrels. I really don''t want to start handloading for just one gun (especially with blackpowder), so I am looking for an alternative short of spending a fortune to have a set of modern steel barrels made. How can I return this fine old gun to the field?\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you have already completed the most important step in trying to return your cherished old gun to the field-having a gunsmith check out its condition. For other readers considering shooting an old Damascus-barreled shotgun, I can''t stress enough the importance of having a competent gunsmith look it over before firing it with any kind of load. With that said, the easiest solution to your problem is to try some of Five Star Classic Cartridge''s (Dept. ST, Box 2059, Jonesboro, GA 30237; phone: 770-473-7100) Pyrodex-powered 12-gauge shotshells. According to Five Star and Hodgdon (who makes Pyrodex), these loads are as safe as any blackpowder shells in this type of shotgun, as long as a competent gunsmith has pronounced the gun shootable. While Five Star''s shotshells are intended primarily for cowboy action shotgun events and are loaded with No. 7 1/2 shot, they could be used for small- and upland-game hunting.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use your Damascus-barreled Parker for a wider variety of shooting, I recommend that you purchase a set of full-length subgauge tubes in 28 gauge or .410 bore. Since the tubes alone are strong enough to handle normal chamber pressures generated by those two chamberings, you could safely fire modern factory ammo in your gun without being concerned about it suffering any damage whatsoever. Two types of subgauge tubes are available, drop-in and custom fitted, and prices usually run anywhere from $300 to $500 per pair.\r\n\r\nNo. 20\r\nIs It Possible To Shoot Skeet With One Gun?\r\nI want to start shooting skeet but cannot afford to buy an entire battery of shotguns. Could I get by with one gun and gauge? If so, what would the combination be? What are some of the more popular skeet guns?\r\n\r\nIf your intention is to shoot skeet for fun and perhaps to sharpen your eye for hunting, any shotgun capable of shooting two rounds will suffice, so long as it is 12 gauge or smaller. I see lots of shooters on the skeet fields with all sorts of hunting guns that would probably never win a tournament, but the fellows shooting them are having a ball and when all is said and done, that''s what is important.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you think you might become serious enough about the game to enter tournaments, you will eventually want to shoot all four events so it is important to start out with the right gun. Very few skeeters shoot a battery of guns these days. Instead, most use a 12-gauge over/under with three sets of subgauge tubes that allow them to also shoot the 20, 28, and .410 in the same gun. Doing so is less expensive than buying four doubles (or one double with four sets of barrels), and more importantly the gun handles and feels close to the same regardless of which of the four shells is being shot.\r\n\r\nYour best bet is to start out with a good 12-gauge double and then add a set of 28-gauge tubes as your budget allows. With the capability of shooting the 12 and 28 in the same gun, you would have three events covered since the National Skeet Shooting Association allows the 28 to be used in both the 28- and 20-gauge events. This would not greatly handicap you since the percentage of targets you will break with the 28 should be about the same as you will break with the 20. Later would come a pair of .410 tubes, and then your last purchase could be the 20-gauge tubes.\r\n\r\nThe most popular manufacturers of over/unders among skeet shooters at this time are Browning, Beretta, Krieghoff, and Perazzi, mainly because of the durability of the guns they build. The most popular barrel length is 28 inches. If you can''t afford a new gun, shop around because clay target shooters switch guns about as often as they change underwear and plenty of used ones (guns that is) are on the market.', ''),

(365394, ' ADVANTAGES OF A PROPER GUN FIT\r\n\r\nGun will shoot exactly where you point it\r\nHead and eye correctly position to rib\r\nNo adjustment time to a unfit gun stock\r\nTransfer your concentration to the target\r\nHold recoil to a bare minimum\r\nReduce fatigue factor Increase confidence\r\nSignificant shooting score improvement\r\nMORE FUN AND LESS PAIN\r\n\r\nThe “more fun” part of shooting comes from breaking more targets, bagging more game with fewer shots, and improving your scores at the club. The “less pain” is accomplished by reducing the felt recoil and eliminating the bruises on your shoulder or cheek. In both of these cases, the main contributor to reducing the pain and increasing fun is having a shotgun stock properly fitted to you. You wouldn’t buy a car without taking it for a test drive; but we continue to purchase shotguns not knowing if it fits us properly. We go through the motions of mounting the gun in the store, looking down the barrel to see if the bead lines up and, if it feels comfortable, we buy it. The next step is taking the shotgun to the nearest range and start shooting. After a while we come to realize that our scores have not improved like we thought they would with the new shotgun. The reason for this is that the shotgun stock dimensions do not fit you properly.\r\n\r\nWHY CUSTOM GUN FITTING?\r\n\r\nThe gun manufacturer who built your shotgun used “standard” stock dimensions intended to fit the “average” male person. Now if we were all “standard” and “average” we would have no problems in shooting the shotgun that the manufacture has built for us. But we all know that each person’s physical characteristics are different in some way. This is especially true for women and children shotgun shooters.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome the one-size-fits-all stock problems, we have taught ourselves to conform to the manufacture’s stock dimensions by contorting our bodies in all sorts of ways. Do the things we do to conform to the “standard” stocks work? In some cases the answer is yes, but it does not allow us to become a consistent shooter. If you are constantly adjusting and re-adjusting your head location before each shot, there is not only a lot of energy lost but you have provided a greater opportunity to make a mistake. A one degree aiming error will result in the pattern of the shot to be 13 inches off at 20 yards. Wouldn’t it be better if you could use that wasted energy to focus on the target rather than the position of our head? \r\n\r\nBy now you are asking yourself, “What can be done to eliminate or minimize these problems and help me become a better shooter?” The answer to this question is going to someone who specializes in custom fitting the stock to you. This person should not only be knowledgeable about shooting and hunting sports, but have and know how to use the necessary equipment.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT AND MEASURES\r\n\r\n(1)  Stock Measuring Equipment\r\n\r\n The measuring equipment is able to collect information on the nine different dimensions on the stock.\r\n\r\nThe nine different measurements that can be adjusted are:\r\n	\r\nS = Length of Stock (Pull)\r\nGL = Grip Length\r\nCC = Drop at Comb\r\nCS = Drop at Comb 2\r\nHH = Drop At Heel of Butt\r\nTH = Stock Length At Heel\r\nTT = Stock Length At Toe\r\nOO = Offset at Heel\r\nTO = Toe Out\r\n \r\n(2) Try-Fit gun\r\n\r\n A Try-Fit gun is a gun which is built so the nine stock dimensions can be changed to fit the shooter’s physical characteristics. The Try-Fit gun can be adjusted to fit your physical characteristics; and from the information obtained from the Try-Fit gun, an assessment can be made on what changes are needed to the shooters gun.\r\n\r\n(3) DryFire Target Simulator \r\n\r\n The DryFire Target Simulator is used to evaluate the shooters ability to break moving targets. The simulator uses a computer to generate a moving target and record the location of the shot density pattern to the clay target location at the time of the shot. This is accomplished by installing a laser in the muzzle end of the shooter''s gun which generates a laser beam at the computer generated target. Once the laser shot is made the computer will show if the target was hit or missed, the location of the pattern density, whether the shooter was in front or behind of the target, high or low on the target and the distance the shot pattern was from the shooter.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSo far we have been gathering information on the computer using the shooter’s own gun. Now we can analyze this information and translate it into the adjustments of the stock of the Try-Fit gun. Now the shooter will use the adjusted Try-Fit gun to shoot at the same computer generated moving targets. Adjustment of the Try-Fit gun will be made until the shooter is able to be comfortable with the shotgun and breaking targets. Once the shooter is showing improvement in consistently hitting moving targets, a comparison of the Try-Fit gun’s measurements and the shooter’s gun measurements is made.\r\n\r\nFrom the measurement comparison,  Proper Gun fit is able to determine what changes are needed on the shooter’s stock so less pain and better shooting can be obtained. Proper Gun Fit specializes in custom fitting the stock to you by evaluating your gun fit and then making the changes to your guns.  Most modifications to the gun can be made in one week.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nProper Gun Fit specializes in custom fitting the stock to you by evaluating your gun fit and then making the changes to your guns.\r\n\r\nOnce the shooter has completed the shooting and the measurement segments, they will be able to mount the shotgun with their eyes closed. When they open their eyes, they will be looking down the barrel sight plane exactly in the proper place. No matter how many times you try this activity, the same sight plane will come because now the stock fits the shooter.\r\n\r\nThe information that was gathered using the measuring equipment, the Try-Fit gun and the DryFire Simulator all come together to ensure that your shooting sport will be “more fun” and “less painful” when you return to your club or are hunting with your buddies, and exhibit your new-found improvements and skills', ''),

However, we are talking about overall stopping power, including when a subject is shot in the flesh. Optimum shot placement/ headshots are not necessarily an option during a high stress/ sudden gunfight. There are plenty of discussions about overall stopping power of .32 acp vs its bigger brothers.

(365780, '30-06 - The Optimum .30 Caliber Rifle Cartridge: By Chuck Hawks As I pointed out in my article "The Ever Popular .30 and .303 Rifle Cartridges," this is the most popular group of rifle cartridges in the world, for both military and sporting purposes. Military use is beyond the scope of this article, but the success of the .30 calibers as hunting cartridges is undeniable.\r\n\r\nFrom the little .30 Carbine through the .30-30, .300 Savage, .308 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield, and the various .300 Magnums, the .30 calibers have always been best sellers. Whether the game in question is fox, deer, antelope, elk, moose, or grizzly bear there is a .30 caliber cartridge suited to the job. No other family of cartridges can claim this versatility, although the smaller 7mm (.28) and larger 8mm (.32) families come close.\r\n\r\nBut which, I got to wondering, is the optimum .30? At what point is the balance between killing power, trajectory, and recoil of a .30 caliber rifle cartridge optimized? Clearly, the .243 Winchester is a better varmint cartridge than any .30, and a .338 Magnum is better brown bear medicine than any .30. So, as versatile as the .30''s calibers are, there is a point somewhere in-between these two levels at which the caliber is optimum. Stray too far in either direction in terms of game size and at some point another caliber becomes a better choice.\r\n\r\nThe .30-30 Winchester is the most popular medium range CXP2 class game cartridge ever devised. Its recoil is sufficiently moderate that most hunters, even those who don''t shoot much in the off season, can shoot it well. But, although it can do the job, something more powerful is generally recommended for tackling large CXP3 class game. And for all its virtues, the .30-30 is not a long range cartridge. With most loads its MPBR is around 225 yards.\r\n\r\nThe .300 Savage is an excellent cartridge, more powerful and flatter shooting than the .30-30. But the .308 Winchester has put the .300 Savage on the skids, as it is a little more of a good thing.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the .308 is probably pretty close to our optimum cartridge. Quite capable of humanely taking the most common species of CXP3 game yet not so powerful as to be overkill on the smaller CXP2 species. And the .308 shoots flat enough to be useful for hunting plains and mountain game. It is also adaptable to short action rifles, which are all the rage these days. Yes, the .308 would be a definite contender for the "Optimum .30 caliber" title. But, due to its short case, it is limited in one respect; it does not handle the heaviest bullets well.\r\n\r\nJust slightly more powerful than the .308 is the venerable .30-06, the most popular big game cartridge in the world. This old timer requires a standard length action, but can deliver, in spades, on all CXP2 and CXP3 class game, and shoots slightly flatter than the .308 to boot. It has a longer case and a longer neck, which allows it great versatility in bullet selection. Using very long 220-250 grain bullets the .30-06 has even accounted for CXP4 class game, including African elephant.\r\n\r\nI guess that pretty much settles it. No .30 caliber cartridge is really appropriate for CXP4 class game, but the fact that the .30-06 has accomplished this feat many times certainly indicates that more power in a .30 is pointless. There is no game animal on this planet that the .30-06 has not and can not humanely take.\r\n\r\nBy that reckoning the .300 Magnums are not optimum .30''s. They kick harder than the .30-06 without meaningfully exceeding its killing power. Some of the new short magnums, due to their bullet limitations, don''t even equal the killing power of the .30-06 on large game. And they all kick more.\r\n\r\nThe .300 Mags shoot flatter than the .30-06, but for plains and mountain hunting there are many calibers that shoot just as flat as the .300''s and kick less, while remaining completely adequate in killing power. These include standard cartridges on the order of the .25-06 and .270 Winchester as well as the .257, .264, .270 and 7mm Magnums.\r\n\r\nFor large CXP3 class game the .300 Magnums fail to deliver the killing power of the medium bore magnums. (Compare the .300 Win. Mag. to the .338 Win. Mag. some time and see what I mean.) Nope, the .300 Magnums are neither fish nor fowl, and they are past the point of diminishing returns for the caliber. They are impressive cartridges, but they are not the optimum .30''s.\r\n\r\nWhen the U.S. military replaced the .30-40 Krag with a new and more powerful cartridge they made a pretty good choice. And inadvertently created the optimum .30 caliber hunting cartridge.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.chuckhawks.com/optimum_30_rifle_cartridge.htm[/url]', ''),

(365992, 'Ammunition for Self Defence Handguns\r\n\r\nOne should carry only hollowpoint ammunition in a defensive handgun. Hollowpoint ammunition has much better stopping power than full metal jacket or round-nose lead, and stopping power is what you need when being assaulted.\r\n\r\nThe point is not to wound or kill the adversary: the point is to stop him in his tracks and make him cease attacking you. "Stopping power" (sometimes called "knock-down power") refers to a particular bullet''s ability to incapacitate an attacker - the greater that ability, the less chance that your attacker will be able to continue shooting, stabbing, or beating you after you have shot him.\r\n\r\nHandguns are not death-rays; despite what you see in the movies, the vast majority of people shot with handguns survive (over 80%). Handguns are weak compared to rifles and shotguns, and thus you want every edge you can get. Great ammunition is no more expensive than mediocre ammunition, so carry the best. Rifles and shotguns have stopping power to spare; handguns do not. Thus you must select your handgun load very carefully, and the detail of the handgun ammunition section reflects this.\r\n\r\nHollowpoint ammunition is NOT more lethal than ball (full metal jacket) ammunition. You may have seen media hype about "killer dum-dum bullets" but this is nonsense. Hollowpoint bullets usually expand and stop in the human body, and thus the attacker absorbs much more of the bullet''s kinetic energy than if the bullet had merely zipped through him and left two small holes. Hollowpoint ammunition is also safer for all parties concerned.\r\n\r\n* You are safer because your attacker is more likely to be incapacitated after one or two shots and thus unable to fire back, stab you, or whatever. The decreased likelihood of your attacker dying from hollowpoint bullets saves you the moral and legal complications and expense you will experience from killing a man.\r\n* Innocent bystanders are safer because hollowpoint bullets are less likely to exit the attacker''s body and go on to injure anyone else. The ricochet danger is also much lower than that of ball ammunition, and hollowpoint bullets are less likely to penetrate walls or doors and strike uninvolved third parties. Furthermore, if your foe is incapacitated quickly he won''t be spraying wild bullets around, endangering uninvolved third parties.\r\n* Lastly, your attacker is safer because he is far less likely to die from one or two hollowpoint bullets than the five or six round-nose slugs you would have had to fire to put him down. Most gunshot deaths occur from shock and loss of blood, and ball rounds tend to make entry and exit wounds, whereas hollowpoints go in and stay put. An attacker shot twice with ball ammo will probably have four holes in him rather than two, and is thus in far greater danger of death from blood loss. If you can avoid killing your attacker you should, for both moral and legal reasons.\r\n\r\nThere are some exceptions to the "carry only hollowpoints in a handgun" rule. Some older or cheaper automatic pistols, will jam with hollowpoint rounds. With these guns one must use ball rounds (or "full metal jacket" rounds - the terms are synonymous), and I specify "reliable with ball only" models by caliber. It is crucial for you to test your pistol to make certain it is reliable with specific loads \r\n\r\n\r\n[B][I]The following article is from an American author and the brands which he is referring too are American and might not be available in Pakistan.[/I][/B]\r\n\r\n[U][B][COLOR="red"]9mm Parabellum (9mm Luger,9x19mm, 9mm NATO, or simply "9mm")[/COLOR][/B][/U]\r\n\r\nThis is unquestionably the world''s most popular pistol round. For this reason it has been the subject of a lot of experimentation, because 9mm ball - used by every army in the Western world - is a mediocre manstopper. Jacketed hollowpoints are a must if one wishes to rely on the 9mm as a defense round. Use ball ammo for practice only.\r\n\r\n9mm ammunition is available in two pressure levels: standard and "+P." The latter should only be used in newer guns (made since 1985 or so), and is best used sparingly. I will deal here with only commercially available ammunition: there are specialized loads available only to law enforcement personnel. Civilians should not worry, as there are commercial loads as good or better than anything restricted to law enforcement usage.\r\n\r\nI will now tell you the best 9mm Luger load for self-defense: it is the Cor-Bon 9mm 115 grain +P Jacketed Hollowpoint. This is the most powerful and street-proven manstopper available in this caliber. It is a high velocity (1340 fps) and high pressure round, and more effective than any load restricted to law enforcement use (such as the Federal 9BPLE).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is also likely to jam many older guns. For this reason I add a table at the end of the 9mm section discussing round suitability for different guns. Modern hollowpoints may either (a) jam, or (b) be too powerful for some older guns. This load is suitable only for First Class pistols (see table).\r\n\r\nThe best standard pressure 9mm load is the Federal 115 grain JHP (9BP). Its effectiveness and accuracy make it the world standard. Buy several boxes. Other excellent standard pressure 9mm loads are the Winchester Silvertip 115 grain (X9MMSHP), and Federal 124 grain Hydra-shok (P9HS1).\r\n\r\nFor guns that may jam with the Cor-Bon or Federal 115 grain hollow-points, the Remington 115 grain +P JHP is a good choice (R9MM6). For older guns I would use the Remington standard pressure 115 gr. JHP (R9MM1).\r\n\r\nNow it is time to impart some crucial information: NEVER use 147 grain ammo in a 9mm pistol! There was a stupid fad for 147 grain hollowpoints a few years ago, and many were suckered into buying these weak, worthless and malfunction-prone rounds. I don''t care what you''ve heard: never use any 9mm hollowpoint heavier than 125 grains. 147 grain hollowpoints often jam in many popular 9mm guns like the Browning Hi-Power, SIG, Beretta 92, S&W and Glock. Ignore the gun magazine hype and stick to what works. If you want to gamble, go to Reno. Don''t gamble with your life. 147 grain ammo sucks.\r\n\r\nBad 9mm Loads to avoid (and certainly NEVER carry). Numbers given:\r\n\r\nFederal Gold Medal 9mm 147 grain JHP (9MS)\r\nFederal Hydra-Shok 9mm 147 grain JHP (P9HS2)\r\nWinchester 147 grain 9mm Silvertip Subsonic JHP (X9MMST147)\r\nWinchester 147 grain 9mm Super-X Subsonic (XSUB9MM)\r\nRemington 147 grain 9mm JHP (R9MM8)\r\nRemington 147 grain 9mm Golden Saber JHP (GS9MMC)\r\nRemington 140 grain 9mm JHP (R9MM7)\r\nRemington 88 grain 9mm JHP (R9MM5) This bullet is far too light.\r\nCCI Lawman 147 grain 9mm PHP "Plated Hollow Point" (3619)\r\n\r\nTable Of 9mm Pistols.\r\n\r\n(Note: just because your pistol appears in Class 3, say, doesn''t mean it is unreliable: it may indeed feed hollowpoints. But you must fire at least 200 rounds of your chosen JHP carry load to determine if your pistol will feed them properly. I have placed pistols in each category according to reputation and experience. These are only meant as guidelines - your pistol may feed JHP rounds better - or worse - than this table indicates)\r\n\r\nFirst Class pistols are ultra-reliable and high-quality new guns than can feed any hollowpoint and tolerate +P loads with no problems: SIG/Sauer P220 series. Czech CZ75 and CZ85. Walther P5, P5C, and P88. Heckler and Koch USP and P7 series. All Glocks. All Ruger 9mm pistols. Taurus PT-99, PT-92 and PT-92C. Steyr GB. Beretta 92 series. Browning BDM and Hi-Power (if it says "Portugal" on the slide). All Smith & Wessons with a four-digit model number (e.g. 5906, 3913, 6904, 5903) and the Smith & Wesson 900 series. Star M28, M30, M31, and all Firestars, Megastars, and Ultrastars.\r\n\r\nSecond Class pistols are high quality guns that may not feed all hollowpoints reliably. Remington 115 gr. hollowpoints are recommended for these guns: Smith & Wessons with two or three digit model numbers (e.g. 659, 39-2, 469, 59, 39). Heckler and Koch VP70 and P9S. Beretta "Brigadier" M1951 and the Egyptian copy, the Interarms "Helwan." Colt M2000 "All-American" (now discontinued, for good reason), Colt Series 70 Government Model, Series 70 Commander. Astra A-70, A-75 and A-100. AMT "On Duty." Daewoo. Bersa ''Thunder 9''. EAA Witness, and all other CZ-75 copies (e.g. Tanfoglio, Tanarmi, Springfield Armory P9). Taurus PT-908. Walther P4. Star BK, BKM, Model B and ''Super.'' Browning Hi-Powers without the word "Portugal" on the slide. Llama Model 82. IMI "Jericho" and "Kareen."\r\n\r\nThird Class pistols should generally be loaded with ball for best reliability - experiment with your gun extensively before carrying JHP: Walther P38, P4 or P1. Luger. Llama. Maverick. MKS Model JS. Intratec CAT-9, DC-9, KG-9, etc. SWD Cobray Model 11/9 and similar models. Scarab Scorpion. Kimel AP-9. Bryco Jennings Model 59. All KBI Hungarian pistols (e.g. GKK, PJ9C, P9HK and other "FEG" products). "Norinco" or "Sportarms" Chinese Tokarev pistols. Lahti. Radom. MAB P15 and Model 1950.', ''),

From personal experience and information from the internet I have learnt that the best way to do it is to hold the gas can nozzle facing down:\n \n \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4602[/ATTACH]\n \nThe green gas bottle has a probe that is stuck into the gas port on the bottom of the inverted magazine, then the gas bottle is pressed down to allow the gas to flow. A completely empty magazine may take several two-second shots of gas before it starts bubbling out the gas port, but a magazine with some gas in it usually needs only one two-second shot to fill it. One fill lasts for two magazine''s worth of BBs, so you fill with gas, then load the first set of BBs, shoot and load a second set of BBs to shoot again.\n \nMake sure you shake the can well before each refill.', ''),

(366132, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;204825]AoA\r\n\r\nYipeeeee! my favorite topic. not because I''m interested in calibers but because AK47 Bhai has come to the rescue of their favorite 0.45ACP caliber (or should I say, THE SHOCK AND AWE CALIBER ;) ).\r\n\r\nanyways, I was under the impression that the test we did a while back comparing two calibers provided us a definitive answer as to which caliber is the best. I my humble opinion, the best caliber is the minimum (weakest) caliber that can get the job done not the largest.\r\n\r\nif somebody wants to know what i''m talking about then let that somebody pull out a 45ACP handgun and fire at a man sized target at 15 yards. afterwards, that same somebody should pull out a 9mm and fire at the same target. in the end count holes.\r\n\r\n9mm will win in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. the number of 9mm bullet holes will be significantly more and it is a medically proven fact that the more holes you got, more the assailant bleeds out faster.\r\n\r\n2. the total diameter of 9mm holes vs 45ACP holes: the total diameter of all 9mm holes would be significantly higher than 45ACP. again this thing suggests the probability of hitting a vital area is significantly higher in 9mm than 45ACP.\r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\n12G bro your theory is applicable when the quantity of 9mm bullets fired are higher than the .45 bullets.

There is no comparison between 15 shots fired versus 12 shots fired provided they all hit at the right spot.\n\nBeing a fan of 9mm and owning one too I still feel it is not a man stopper as compared to the .45. I would have bought the 1911 within a heartbeat if it were not for financial constraints as I can only afford to own one pistol at a given time.\n\nA round hits human flesh and if the cavity is bigger than that mean more nerve and tissue damage resulting to a greater shock and higher bleeding.

But he was the best dog.\nsorry for this longggggg text lol i was writing my memories. anyways\nbro what i wanna say is, take your time, collect money, i was really young at that time to have this much amount, but save money for some time and get a good pup coz buying a dog is very easy, A dog purchased in 50-60k and in 20k, you gonna give them same food, same environment, gonna invest equal time, but at the end it won''t be a GSD you''re looking for i mean the pure bloodline.\n\nhope you''re not bored :)', ''),

I thought to share my info with all of you. If bros travelling there find that they have a bit of time, this info can be useful for them\r\n\r\nThere are the following shooting clubs/ranges in the UAE\r\n\r\n1- Jebel Ali Shooting club - Jebel Ali, just off the free zone, Dubai  [url]http://www.jebelali-international.com/properties/jagrs/SportsLeisure/ShootingClub/Dining.aspx[/url]\r\n\r\n2- RAK Shooting Club - Emirate of Ras Al Khaima\r\n\r\n3- Abu Dhabi (Al Forsan) Shooting Club - Abu Dhabi  [url]http://www.alforsan.com/en/shooting/overview3.html[/url]\r\n\r\n4- Caracal Shooting Club - Abu Dhabi  [url]http://www.caracalsc.ae/index.php[/url]\r\n\r\n5- Sharjah Golf and Shooting Club - Near Tasjeel Auto Village, Sharjah  [url]http://www.golfandshootingshj.com/[/url]\r\n\r\n6- Umm Al Quwain Shooting Club - Emirate of Umm Al Quwain (may have closed down)\r\n\r\nI was able to visit the [B]Jebel Ali Shooting club[/B] one day, and [B]Sharjah Golf and Shooting Club[/B] another day during my stay', ''),
(366262, ' [B]Jebel Ali Shooting Club[/B] is part of Jebel Ali Golf Resort and Spa. It has facilities for outdoor skeet and trap and an indoor pistol range. At the time of my visit, the pistol range was being refurbished so regrettably I couldn''t visit/avail it. Instead I did some trap shooting with the assistance of range master Shaiju. The gun was a Beretta 686 O/U that was an absolute pleasure to hold, aim and shoot. The ammo was #7.5 sports from the Philipines, the brand name of which I''ve forgotten. In 25 shells, there were two failures to fire, both with strong primer stikes\nThe timings of this club are 4pm to 10:45pm, the down light time being amply floodlit. This time is bearable in the UAE heat.\nThe best way to get to the club is to take the Dubai Metro from anywhere to one stop before Jebel Ali (so you don''t have to backtrack) and then take a cab from there through the free zone to the club. If travelling from around the Mall of Emirates, this costs around 30 AED\nFor non-club-members like me, the cost of one round of 25 shells is 220 AED including everything - gun, range time, ammo, bit of apparel needed to hold the shells. You need to show your passport for ID and record keeping, though this club didn''t ask me for mine as i had faxed the same from my hotel at the time of reservation\nFor travel back, the club calls a cab for you which arrives in 15 min. I did you all proud at the club and would like to redirect appreciation I received from range staff to PakGuns where I learned whatever chops i possess', ''),
(366263, ' [B]Sharjah Golf and Shooting Club[/B] is a health spa for families, a beautiful and scenic place with two excellent indoor ranges for pistol and rifle shooting. These were upto 25m and upto 50m, 5 line ranges with mounted targets that could be moved 10m to max range in 5m increments.\nHere, the range of pistols available was impressive - competition .22s Ruger, Hammerli; 9mm Sig Sauer X5, X6, Beretta 92 FS, CZ 75 Tactical Sport and one or two others, Glock 17, 19. I don''t know much about rifles but different bolt action ones were available as well as the M16 carbine\nI was interested in shooting 9mm and fired one round of 50 shots with Glock 17 and another round of 50 with Sig Sauer X6. The former cost 110AED and latter 130AED. The difference in price is beyond me! It was the same ammo, just different guns. \nI was hoping to run into the Caracal pistols but this club didn''t have them. A bro travelling to Abu Dhabi can catch them at the Caracal shooting club\nThis club has strict rules about paperwork. You show your passport or any UAE papers of residence or visit, a copy of passport is submitted and there are live cameras on the ranges where police and intelligence are monitoring you by laws of the UAE for a shooting range\nBest way to get to the club is take the UAE bus from any emirate (in my case dubai) to Sharjah and a then a cab to Tasjeel auto village, the club is very close to it\nI shot at 15m aimed and 10m rapid and had a decent performance. I feel wherever I go to shoot, I represent PG and better show the best preparation, conduct and performance. To that I''m happy to say I have much more appreciation to redirect your way.

For this I would be, and am immensely grateful in advance. \r\n\r\n   The pistol is a real pleasure to shoot, the accuracy is phenomenal. Only about 15 rounds have been fired through it by the previous owner out of a box of 50 Winchester Super Max Hollow Point .22 LR Ammo. The unfired bullets and a spare Magazine also came with it.

Quails fly low, so one has to be very aware of surrounding to make sure that the shot is safe for everyone involved.', ''),
