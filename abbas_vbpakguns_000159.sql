Clones are a hit or miss business. Countless members over here will tell you that clones are unsafe, unreliable, prone to failures etc, and they''re probably right. BUT, I can tell you from personal experience that not all clones are bad, and that if you''re lucky, you could land a pretty good piece. I have a locally made Tokarev. Can''t tell you who made it, or when, but its an older model, and it has NEVER EVER had a failure of any sort. In fact, it was stored (in less than ideal conditions) for about a decade before I field-stripped it, cleaned it, lubed it, and fired it. The ammo I used for these maiden shots was dated "1978." \n\nHowever, with that said, would I still recommend a local gun...No. With your budget get a Chinese Tokarev and be confident in the reliability of your weapon. \n\nIf you can bump up your budget to 57k or so, buy the the new Zastava EZ9. Its just as good as the CZ999, but has an accessory rail as well. It is an amazing weapon, far superior to the NP22 and only marginally more expensive.

Differences in velocity, sound, etc, are so minimal, there is more variance between different ammo and even from round to round of the same ammo. Imho, one thing ported handguns do reduce hugely is shooting pleasure. That is, unless you enjoy having burning particles of powder being thrown back on your front sight, hands, arms, and face. \nA proper muzzle break on a high powered rifle is another matter altogether. Such a setup definitely will, be louder from the shooter''s perspective (and to anyone next to him), reduce muzzle rise and felt recoil, and not affect velocity or accuracy.', ''),

With this quick aquisition feature, it becomes a wonderful hunting rest as well. \n\nHolding the rifle at two points securely, it will take care of all the weight and help the shooter to take longer shots much quickly & precisely.\n\nHope it works out the way it is preceived.

Good feel and handling. \n\nI can give a better review regarding Walther P22 as I personally own one and it has performed very well. The gun has hardly any recoil (good for your father''s use also he can do extensive practice with it since ammo is cheaper) - its a 10 shot pistol thus making it very compact and very light thus highly recommended for CC. It has a sort-of dual safety mechanism (manual safety + the gun doesn''t fire if the mag is removed even if there is a round in the chamber though I would not suggest trying that in unsafe environments). Also have only used good quality ammo like RWS High Velocity so I have yet to see any jams or misfires as some PG members claim. Overall great gun.\n\nHowever I am selling my Walther P22 as I am planning to shift to a higher calibre. I have posted an ad here:\n\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?11691-WTS-Walther-P22-(-22lr)-Pistol[/URL]\n\nIf you are interested you can reach me through my email [EMAIL="taha.huzain@gmail.com"]taha.huzain@gmail.com[/EMAIL]\n\nregards', ''),

(537261, '200 rounds - going strong and getting better (hopefully) I''m a first time gun owner (CZ P07 Duty). Today was my second day at the range, fired roughly 100 (redbox) rounds. Much better then my first day at the range. \n\n(Day 1) - I could not hit the target from 10 meters on my first day, the recoil and the sound was just overwhelming, and my hand wouldn''t stop shaking for the first 5 mins. At 5 meters I started hitting the target, but all my shots were firing low, I was aiming at the Bulls-eye but was hitting no. 6 & 7  and far below my aim for the first 50-60 rounds. By the end for my last 40 rounds I had a good group of 4 on the bulls-eye and was getting used to the recoil and the deafening sound. \n\n(Day 2) - Brother Aquarius was kind enough to tell me my grip was all wrong, today. He showed me the right way to hold the handgun, and boy o boy did that make a difference. Today I started at 5 meters again, hitting nice groups at the 8 & 9 circles for the first 30-40 rounds. For my next 60 rounds I went back to the dreaded 10 meters, and what do you know, I was hitting the target, had at least 5-8 nice bulls-eyes and most of the groups were appearing at the 8 & 9 circles. \n\nHopefully, on my 3rd-4th visit i will move back to 15 meters as well. I also had the chance to watch brother Aquarius shoot with his beauties (CZ SP01 Tactical, CZ P01 and the beautiful baby Glock 26). Brother Aquarius went single handed for most of his shooting and boy did his Glock 26 do some lovely shooting. He would be probably be in a better position to let the great Pak-Gunners know how it went for him. \n\nI will keep updating this thread about all the practice I get, hopefully in future with pictures as well.\n\nRegards,', ''),

(537431, 'Review: norinco np42 2nd gen The gun was given a much deserved welcome from the dealers and weapon lovers around pakistan since it came in the end of 2012.\n\n\nAs other 2nd gen weapons, the gun was expected to be better then the previous predecessor.\nBut most enthusiasts commented that they didnt get quiet what they expected.\n\n\nThats probably because we expect the new corolla to look better than the old one. \n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/8BC070F8-A7DF-4163-A290-7A88C27B1433-4218-000005E64E2E58D4_zps0ee6c5e9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/1D9FB44F-3B74-4782-8D3D-D5BE82A41200-4218-000005E65729C1BE_zps2b1592de.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/9998CBD1-1404-4B43-8A61-6729A17F6EF9-4619-000006CB3F9932CE_zps7739fb6c.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/4876D944-E88F-48DF-849B-F5162861EF44-4619-000006CB43E9B243_zps0894d543.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThe 2nd gen np42 some how feels better in terms of performance and finishing both internal and external.\nIt actually looks funny and not aggressive at all so it kills the whole point of getting a gun.\nWho will take me seriously if my gun doesn''t look mean :p \n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/CD0D775A-792D-43F9-A8F6-7200F6E485A0-4218-000005E7317AA7DB_zps021853e6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nLets talk business.\n\n\nInitial impression:\n\n\nNorinco improved the finishing of the box, the external and the internals of the gun.\nThe gun has some kind of a protective matt coating which is good.\n\n\nIn the hand, the grip feels slim but not very natural.\nA very nice checkering is added on the back if the grip.\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/9998CBD1-1404-4B43-8A61-6729A17F6EF9-4619-000006CB3F9932CE_zps7739fb6c.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nWith a loaded mag, the gun is lighter than most 15 shot pistols, thanks to the polymer frame.\nIt actually has a better checkering on the grips and the rails is another value addition.\n\n\nThe groves in the front of the slide is another good thing for tactical shooters.\n\n\nThe sights are zeroed nicely and are visible. Also slim for better accuracy.\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/75F2A610-B774-4499-B6EE-32B6C6B746DE-4218-000005E6675E66EB_zps99a44e9e.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThe decocker/safety is hard as\nexpected. Will soften over time.\n\n\nOver all the gun is slim and light.\n\n\nPerformance:\n\n\nThe trigger and hammer had noise like dust stuck in there. Completely stripped and washed. Perfect now.\nTrigger breaks smoothly and has nice takeup. \n\n\nThe slide is smooth. The good part is that there are groves in the front part of the slide which is better for practical shooting.\n\n\nInternals are same as before. The slide doesnt run in the polymer frame. Instead, a metal frame runs within the polymer frame.\nSo its as tough as its predecessor.\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/67FF264D-D7FA-409A-B083-AA033F9744BE-4218-000005E73723D088_zpsfc5ebe24.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThe dislikes:\n\n\nThe grip has some edges that might hurt after exscessive use.\n\n\nMag release is not very prominent hence no fast reloads.\n\n\nThe guns safety/decocker is stiff as before..\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/B67C38FC-F5BF-4FE0-BC61-879595DA11B4-4218-000005E77986A8E9_zps81d7536a.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nComparison with np34:\n\nI still love my np34 more.

YES, deweaponization is done in essence, to deprive law abiding citizens of their legal and lawfully purchased weapons leaving them high and dry, and the criminals are still left at large toting their rental/illegal TTs...\n\nLEAs do not and [U][B]cannot[/B][/U] verify from your local PS about the authenticity of the entry, as per my contacts.\n\nThe register which has the manual entry of weapons is not an easy access computerized system and by making a phone call from a roadside snap post, a cop cannot be given info just like that by the PS :)\n\nAs for LEAs bothering you becoz of no PS entry, well they do that anyway if they want to, eh? :)\n\nso many times I have been stopped by traffic police or snap checks (not carrying) and if they want to bug me they end up finding one thing or another in my car documents to squeeze money out of me and then there have been times when i was stopped and asked "are you carrying a weapon?" and upon affirmation, they ask me to step out and show the weapon and license, they go over it and let me go.\n\nSo it all depends... i would still advise against a PS entry as it is an advertisement to come collect good and free weapons whenever something goes wrong, or harrass me to check my weapon everytime a 9mm is used in a crime in the neighbourhood...\n\nBtw, did anyone read the biased centre-page news report on arms and ammunition in yesterday''s Dawn Images? :yell:', ''),

(537620, ' [url]http://dawn.com/news/1023462/lethal-weapon[/url]\n\nIt is a case of whether the chicken came first or the egg. In this case, the nine millimetre caliber weapons or their bullets as the 9mm pistol is most popular all over the world due to the ready availability of 9mm bullets. But then the bullets are produced in quantity and are easily available because there is a demand for them.\n\nStill, the handsome and stylish pistols are also sought due to their handiness. When compared to the Kalashnikov AK-47, the 9mm pistol also has a more affordable licence as 9mm after all comes under non-prohibited bore (NPB) and its licence for civilians costs Rs4,000 with Rs500 for annual renewal. Just like this, the licence for a shotgun is Rs2,000 with Rs400 for annual renewal. But the licence for the AK-47 is Rs15,000.\n\nIt falls under the prohibited bore category also makes it difficult to acquire. Automatic weapons that shoot in bursts have especially expensive licences as they are not meant for civilians. A civilian wanting to keep the weapon anyway may have to try other means such as bribing the people concerned to get a licence issued for an AK-47, which means the cost of the licence can go up to Rs100,000 to Rs125,000. The hassle is not welcomed. The AK-47, anyway, is usually owned by companies and businesses to arm their guards.\n\nAnother reason for the AK-47 to be no match in popularity against the 9mm pistol is its size. &#8220;It&#8217;s an assault weapon, which is not handy enough due to its size. As for the pistol, it is far easier to carry around,&#8221; Mohammad Asim Afridi, a weapons dealer near the Lucky Star intersection in Karachi, points out.\n\nKarachi and Lahore are the biggest markets for quality weapons as these are big cities importing the guns. There are a variety of branded 9mm pistols available, for instance, Smith and Wesson, Glock, Heckler & Koch (HK), Walther, Taurus, Sarsilmaz, Ceska Zbrojovka (CZ) and Norinco. Of the brands mentioned the best seller is the Norinco, which is made in China, the Turkish Sarsilmaz and the Brazilian Taurus pistol. &#8220;The Chinese costs around Rs50,000, the Turkish between Rs50,000 to Rs1,00,000 and the Brazilian around Rs100,000. Prices for the rest range between Rs100,000 to Rs400,000. But looking for cheaper pistols, one can also go for the &#8216;Made in Pakistan&#8217; variety as we manufacture copies of all the big brands, in the range of around Rs15,000 to Rs20,000,&#8221; the weapon dealer shares.\n\nThe biggest local weapons manufacturers are now located in the Industrial Estate on Kohat Road in Peshawar. After the closing down of the illegal Darra Adam Khel weapons factories, most manufactures there have now got manufacturing licences and are making good quality guns legally.\n\nAs for the 9mm bullets and how much they cost, Afridi discusses all kinds and their prices. &#8220;There is the hydra shok bullet that explodes after penetration. It is the most dangerous and most expensive bullet, costing Rs500 each. Hollow-point is another kind of bullet that spreads in size after penetration and each bullet costs Rs100. Then the high-velocity subsonic bullet costs Rs150 each. This bullet with a blunt tip when shot can break hard surfaces. Finally, there is the ball ammo bullet with a full-metal jacket [FMJ]. The Chinese make is Rs36 each and local Rs20 each,&#8221; informs the expert, while adding that different guns have different magazine capacity with most carrying up to 15 bullets.\n\nIn comparison with the quality of local guns, which is not so bad, the local bullets are of poor quality. &#8220;They produce much smoke when fired and the corrosive residue left behind by these inside the weapon encourages rusting. They are poor in quality because they are cheap. The quality can be improved, like those manufactured at the Pakistan Ordinance Factory at Wah Cantt, of course, but then the price will go up,&#8221; the dealer concludes.', ''),

I tried Private Messaging you but may be you have deactivated your Private Messaging.[/QUOTE]\n\nSir first of all you need to know that this strategy is only effective during full moon otherwise you will not see the bird unless its just over your head or if it is calling.\nYou need dug out hides in front of your decoys not behind the decoys so the bird flies or lands right over you and in your range. Because of the moonlight you will be able to see the bird coming from a long distance away and your guide or your assistant will have to turn the search light on when you think that the bird is in your shooting range otherwise it will change the flight path and away from your shotgun range.\nThe most important thing is to have a search light with wider lens so the light disperses wider and you can estimate the lead and range.\nDo not put decoys in the water because shellducks , geese and mallards land on ground at night.\nYou need to be set and ready before 6.00 and hunt till 11 because after 11 the birds rest where they land till first light in the morning.\n\nAnother strategy which the locals use most in our area is to throw feed just before mughrib prayers for two days before hunting .', ''),

A simple google search has shown that this is quite a common problem and people point towards using the safety lever for decocking as a possible cause. Truth be told I had a bad habit of cocking my gun (on an empty chamber of course) and decocking with the lever.\n\nThe broken lever looks exactly like the one shown in below given picture (of someone elses gun, taken off the internet):\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22400[/ATTACH]\n\nThe safety still works but it takes a lot of effort to manipulate this "half" lever. However, I prefer to carry the gun without a round in the chamber and the safety off, so this functionality is not as important for me. \n\nThe more important issue I am facing is that the broken safety has made racking the slide a painful process. \n\nNeed suggestions from the seniors here on how can I get this issue fixed. The only 2 options I can think of are:\n\n1) Glue a piece of rubber so that my finger does not contact the rough metal\n2) Remove the safety lever entirely (is this even possible?)\n\nThanks in advance for any response!', ''),

(537859, 'An Alternate Look at Handgun Stopping Power by Greg Ellifritz\n I''ve been interested in firearm stopping power for a very long time. I  remember reading Handguns magazine back in the late 1980s when Evan  Marshall was writing articles about his stopping power studies. When  Marshall''s first book came out in 1992, I ordered it immediately,  despite the fact that I was a college student and really couldn''t afford  its $39 price tag. Over the years I bought all of the rest of  Marshall''s books as well as anything else I could find on the subject. I  even have a first edition of [I]Gunshot Injuries[/I] by Louis Lagarde published in 1915.\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/graphics/cartridges.jpg[/IMG] [B]Are any of these better than another?[/B]\n \n Every source I read has different recommendations. Some say  Marshall''s data is genius. Some say it is statistically impossible. Some  like big heavy bullets. Some like lighter, faster bullets. There isn''t  any consensus. The more I read, the more confused I get.\n One thing I remember reading that made a lot of sense to me was an  article by Massad Ayoob. He came out with his own stopping power data  around the time Marshall published [I]Handgun Stopping Power[/I]. In  the article, Ayoob took his critics to task. He suggested that if people  didn''t believe his data, they should collect their own and do their own  analysis. That made sense to me. So that''s just what I did.  I always  had a slight problem with the methodology of Marshall and Sanow''s work.   For consistency purposes, they ONLY included hits to the torso and ONLY  included cases where the person was hit with just a single round.   Multiple hits screwed up their data, so they excluded them.  This led to  an unrealistically high stopping power percentage, because it factored  out many of the cases where a person didn''t stop!  I wanted to look at  hits anywhere on the body and get a realistic idea of actual stopping  power, no matter how many hits it took to get it.  So I started  collecting data.\n Over a 10-year period, I kept track of stopping power results from  every shooting I could find. I talked to the participants of gunfights,  read police reports, attended autopsies, and scoured the newspapers,  magazines, and Internet for any reliable accounts of what happened to  the human body when it was shot.\n I documented all of the data I could; tracking caliber, type of  bullet (if known), where the bullet hit and whether or not the person  was incapacitated. I also tracked fatalities, noting which bullets were  more likely to kill and which were not. It was an exhaustive project,  but I''m glad I did it and I''m happy to report the results of my study  here.\n Before I get to the details, I must give a warning. I don''t have any  dog in this fight! I don''t sell ammo.  I''m not being paid by any firearm  or ammunition manufacturer. I carry a lot of different pistols for self  defense. Within the last 2 weeks, I''ve carried a .22 magnum, a .380  auto, a .38 spl revolver, 3 different 9mm autos and a .45 auto.  I don''t  have an axe to grind. If you are happy with your 9mm, I''m happy for  you. If you think that everyone should be carrying a .45 (because they  don''t make a .46), I''m cool with that too. I''m just reporting the data.  If you don''t like it, take Mr. Ayoob''s advice...do a study of your own.\n A few notes on terminology...\n Since it was my study, I got to determine the variables and their definitions. Here''s what I looked at:\n - Number of people shot\n - Number of rounds that hit\n - On average, how many rounds did it take for the person to stop his  violent action or be incapacitated? For this number, I included hits  anywhere on the body.  To be considered an immediate incapacitation, I  used criteria similar to Marshall''s.  If the attacker was striking or  shooting the victim, the round needed to immediately stop the attack  without another blow being thrown or shot being fired.  If the person  shot was in the act of running (either towards or away from the  shooter), he must have fallen to the ground within five feet.\n I also excluded all cases of accidental shootings or suicides.  Every  shot in this study took place during a military battle or an  altercation with a criminal.\n - What percentage of shooting incidents resulted in fatalities. For this, I included only hits to the head or torso.\n - What percentage of people were not incapacitated no matter how many rounds hit them\n - Accuracy. What percentage of hits was in the head or torso. I  tracked this to check if variations could affect stopping power. For  example, if one caliber had a huge percentage of shootings resulting in  arm hits, we may expect that the stopping power of that round wouldn’t  look as good as a caliber where the majority of rounds hit the head.\n - One shot stop percentage - number of incapacitations divided by the  number of hits the person took.

Getting accurate data on nearly 1800 shootings was hard  work. I couldn''t imagine breaking it down farther than what I did here. I  also believe the data for the .25, .32 and .44 magnum should be viewed  with suspicion. I simply don''t have enough data (in comparison to the  other calibers) to draw an accurate comparison. I reported the data I  have, but I really don''t believe that a .32 ACP incapacitates people at a  higher rate than the .45 ACP!\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_OneShot_Percent.png[/IMG]One  other thing to look at is the 9mm data. A huge number (over half) of  9mm shootings involved ball ammo. I think that skewed the results of the  study in a negative manner. One can reasonable expect that FMJ ammo  will not stop as well as a state of the art expanding bullet. I  personally believe that the 9mm is a better stopper than the numbers  here indicate, but you can make that decision for yourself based on the  data presented.\n\n\n Some interesting findings:\n I think the most interesting statistic is the percentage of people  who stopped with one shot to the torso or head. There wasn''t much  variation between calibers. Between the most common defensive calibers  (.38, 9mm, .40, and .45) there was a spread of only eight percentage  points. No matter what gun you are shooting, you can only expect a  little more than half of the people you shoot to be immediately  incapacitated by your first hit.\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Incapacitation.png[/IMG]The  average number of rounds until incapacitation was also remarkably  similar between calibers. All the common defensive calibers required  around 2 rounds on average to incapacitate. Something else to look at  here is the question of how fast can the rounds be fired out of each  gun. The .38 SPL probably has the slowest rate of fire (long double  action revolver trigger pulls and stout recoil in small revolvers) and  the fewest rounds fired to get an incapacitation (1.87). Conversely the  9mm can probably be fired fastest of the common calibers and it had the  most rounds fired to get an incapacitation (2.45). The .40 (2.36) and  the .45 (2.08) split the difference. It is my personal belief that there  really isn''t much difference between each of these calibers. It is only  the fact that some guns can be fired faster than others that causes the  perceived difference in stopping power. If a person takes an average of  5 seconds to stop after being hit, the defender who shoots a lighter  recoiling gun can get more hits in that time period. It could be that  fewer rounds would have stopped the attacker (given enough time) but the  ability to fire more quickly resulted in more hits being put onto the  attacker. It may not have anything to do with the stopping power of the  round.\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Rnds_to_Incap.png[/IMG]Another  data piece that leads me to believe that the majority of commonly  carried defensive rounds are similar in stopping power is the fact that  all four have very similar failure rates. If you look at the percentage  of shootings that did not result in incapacitation, the numbers are  almost identical. The .38, 9mm, .40, and .45 all had failure rates of  between 13% and 17%.\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Failure_to_Incap.png[/IMG]Some  people will look at this data and say "He''s telling us all to carry  .22s".  That''s not true.  Although this study showed that the  percentages of people stopped with one shot are similar between almost  all handgun cartridges, there''s more to the story.  Take a look at two  numbers: the percentage of people who did not stop (no matter how many  rounds were fired into them) and the one-shot-stop percentage.  The  lower caliber rounds (.22, .25, .32) had a failure rate that was roughly  double that of the higher caliber rounds.  The one-shot-stop percentage  (where I considered all hits, anywhere on the body) trended generally  higher as the round gets more powerful.  This tells us a couple of  things...\n\n In a certain (fairly high) percentage of shootings, people stop their  aggressive actions after being hit with one round regardless of caliber  or shot placement.  These people are likely NOT physically  incapacitated by the bullet.  They just don''t want to be shot anymore  and give up!  Call it a psychological stop if you will.  Any bullet or  caliber combination will likely yield similar results in those cases.   And fortunately for us, there are a lot of these "psychological stops"  occurring.  The problem we have is when we don''t get a psychological  stop.  If our attacker fights through the pain and continues to  victimize us, we might want a round that causes the most damage  possible.  In essence, we are relying on a "physical stop" rather than a  "psychological" one.  In order to physically force someone to stop  their violent actions we need to either hit him in the Central Nervous  System (brain or upper spine) or cause enough bleeding that he becomes  unconscious.  The more powerful rounds look to be better at doing this.\n One other factor to consider is that the majority of these shootings  did NOT involve shooting through intermediate barriers, cover or heavy  clothing.  If you anticipate having to do this in your life (i.e. you  are a police officer and may have to shoot someone in a car), again, I  would lean towards the larger or more powerful rounds.\n What I believe that my numbers show is that in the majority of  shootings, the person shot merely gives up without being truly  incapacitated by the bullet.  In such an event, almost any bullet will  perform admirably.  If you want to be prepared to deal with someone who  won''t give up so easily, or you want to be able to have good performance  even after shooting through an intermediate barrier, I would skip  carrying the "mouse gun" .22s, .25s and .32s.\n Now compare the numbers of the handgun calibers with the numbers  generated by the rifles and shotguns. For me there really isn''t a  stopping power debate. All handguns suck! If you want to stop someone,  use a rifle or shotgun!\n What matters even more than caliber is shot placement. Across all  calibers, if you break down the incapacitations based on where the  bullet hit you will see some useful information.\n Head shots = 75% immediate incapacitation\nTorso shots = 41% immediate incapacitation\nExtremity shots (arms and legs) = 14% immediate incapacitation.\n No matter which caliber you use, you have to hit something important in order to stop someone!\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Accuracy.png[/IMG]\n [B]Conclusion[/B]\n This study took me a long time and a lot of effort to complete.  Despite the work it took, I''m glad I did it. The results I got from the  study lead me to believe that there really isn''t that much difference  between most defensive handgun rounds and calibers. None is a death ray,  but most work adequately...even the lowly .22s. I''ve stopped worrying  about trying to find the "ultimate" bullet. There isn''t one. And I''ve  stopped feeling the need to strap on my .45 every time I leave the house  out of fear that my 9mm doesn''t have enough "stopping power." Folks,  carry what you want. Caliber really isn''t all that important.\n Take a look at the data. I hope it helps you decide what weapon to  carry. No matter which gun you choose, pick one that is reliable and  train with it until you can get fast accurate hits. Nothing beyond that  really matters!\n You may also enjoy this Greg Ellifritz story: [URL="http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/node/8240"]A Parent''s Guide to School Shootings[/URL]\n [I]Greg Ellifritz is the full time firearms and defensive tactics  training officer for a central Ohio police department.

Hunting leopards is not legal it can get you behund bars for atleast 7 years but still villagers hunt them after getting their cattle devoured,leopards in abbottabad are gugantic as compared to those found in india or africa a large fully grown leopard can reach the length of 9.3 over curves and 9 under curves keeping in mind that the famous man eating leopard of rudraprayag was 7.something when finally shot by jim corbett in 1926, snow leopard which is also the state animal of gilgit baltistan is much smaller as compared to the leopards found in abbottabad and kashmir region, there are chances of asiatic cheeta in balochistan but not confirmed same is the case with asiatic lions. Asiatic lions differ from their counterpartst in gujrat, India and africa. Both species found in gujrat india are much larger than asiatic lions found in iran. Asiatic lions have  a very differ3t mane which is very dark and thick. Asiatic lions live in semi-mountaineous places like balochistan and iran. Tigers are long gone from pakistan the last was shot in 1940s but there are un confirmed reports of siberian tigers sighted in  north of pakistan according to national geographic and other sources siberian tigers are only left in china and russia, so the presence of the largest cat a siberian tiger is extremely doubtful in the north of pakistan, siberian tiger is also the second largest carnivora after polar bear on planet, estimated number left in forests are 400,', ''),

Hunting leopards is not legal it can get you behund bars for atleast 7 years but still villagers hunt them after getting their cattle devoured,leopards in abbottabad are gugantic as compared to those found in india or africa a large fully grown leopard can reach the length of 9.3 over curves and 9 under curves keeping in mind that the famous man eating leopard of rudraprayag was 7.something when finally shot by jim corbett in 1926, snow leopard which is also the state animal of gilgit baltistan is much smaller as compared to the leopards found in abbottabad and kashmir region, there are chances of asiatic cheeta in balochistan but not confirmed same is the case with asiatic lions. Asiatic lions differ from their counterpartst in gujrat, India and africa. Both species found in gujrat india are much larger than asiatic lions found in iran. Asiatic lions have  a very differ3t mane which is very dark and thick. Asiatic lions live in semi-mountaineous places like balochistan and iran. Tigers are long gone from pakistan the last was shot in 1940s but there are un confirmed reports of siberian tigers sighted in  north of pakistan according to national geographic and other sources siberian tigers are only left in china and russia, so the presence of the largest cat a siberian tiger is extremely doubtful in the north of pakistan, siberian tiger is also the second largest carnivora after polar bear on planet, estimated number left in forests are 400,[/QUOTE]\n\n\na very informative post', ''),

(538018, ' TODAY''S SHOOTING SESSION:\n\nIt was mild and windy this afternoon in Lahore and for the first time I increased my shooting distance from 14 Yard to 18 Yard. Lawn at my residence is only 15 Yard wall to wall so I placed the target diagonally to achieve that distance.\n\nFirst attempt at 3:30 was a failure. I shot some 15 pellets but was all over the place. Only a few within 3" circle. Got frustrated and packed up, shots on paper were so scattered that i did not even take a snap of it. When stress relieved a bit, I thought over my mistakes and found out that 1" black bulls eye was not properly visible from my sights at that distance, and target being under the shed, it was more difficult to align the tip of front sight with bulls eye. they were merging with each other hence my focus was out on almost every shot.\n\nI drafted a new colour target in MS Word, printed, and got started again. Out of first 7 shots I got a good close group of 6 on middle bulls eye. I was full of joy seeing my group from that distance with open sights. All tutorial videos were playing in my sub conscious :) ... but after few more shots I felt tiredness and started to loose concentration and pellets started drifting away from target. Results are posted here for everybody.\n\nOverall, I am satisfied with my performance and I believe that more practice will tune up my sighting, breathing, trigger control and follow through.\n\nResults. Shot 15 pellets at each bulls eye. Center First, Right Second, Left Third.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22450[/ATTACH]\n\nDistance\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22451[/ATTACH]\n\nShooting Position.

(538063, ' Naweed, \n\nCongrats on your latest toy. The HW50 is a good gun, and the HW50S with the Rekord trigger is great gun. Like its younger brother the HW30, the HW50 is a medium powered springer, but what it lacks in muzzle velocity, it makes up for in accuracy. Unlike the high powered springers such as the HW80 and above, it is not very hold sensitive, and in stable hands, its quite capable of bringing down pigeons as far as 50 yards away. \n\nThe best upgrade you could possibly do to this gun, once the original spring has been worn out, is to strip it down, disassemble it fully, degrease all the parts and then install a Jim Maccari kit (new spring, spring guide, seals and spring tar), and thoroughly re-lubricate it. I did that in my HW30 several years ago, and the HW30 felt like a totally different gun, it shot better - smoother, quieter and possibly faster than when I had first bought it. \n\nOne thing you might want to do is to try what ammo your HW50 likes best. My HW30 shot best RWS Superdomes. The H&N Barracudas are good for new gun to help seat in the seals and to prevent dieseling, but too much usage may cause early spring demise, I am told. \n\nDo keep us updated about this marvellous piece of German engineering.', ''),

Yes CZ Duty feels good in hand as well. \n\nNow the advise need is, should I buy CZ Duty or EZ 9?[/QUOTE]\n\nI was in the same boat as you several months back - I went with the EZ9. Here''s how I see it:\n\nIn my opinion if you are going to buy a Duty, buy the newer version (that also comes in OD Green) since CZ has worked over some of the quirks that plagued earlier gen guns. But, if you do go for the newer models, they are a good 20k or so more expensive than the EZ-9. So, if you get the EZ9 you''ll save a bunch of money for ammo, tactical accessories etc. \n\nSecondly, the EZ-9 is a metal gun, and as much as I like the Duty, I''m not a big fan of polymer guns (unless they''re Glocks, HKs, S&Ws, Springfields, FNs and the like). \n\nThirdly, and something that many people fail to understand, is that Zastava has been making guns for over 150 years! Its an old world armoury that is very well respected and is often used for military contracts. The EZ-9s that have made their way to the States have also received nothing but praise. Its a tough, reliable, no-frills gun that is easy to disassemble and clean. And, if you do your bit, it is quite accurate too. \n\nSave your cash, buy the EZ-9.

The additional man-hours will translate into cost & eventually price, challenging the market competitiveness. \n\nBedding is mostly needed and done on \n* less expensive production rifles: Manufacturers do not perform bedding to save on cost and are comfortable with acceptable accuracy. \n\n*Older rifles: Old wood tends to lose shape and strength adding to the tolerance or gaps between action and stock.\n\n* Custom Built Rifles: The builders do not leave anything to chances.\n\nThe good and expensive rifles have these things taken care of with the use of hi-tec tools for stock manufacturing with least possible manufacturing tolerance, pillar mounts to avaid sinking and sagging of torque screws and  over-all exceptional fit & finish.

I did some number crunching with your rig set-up based on the following: \n \nAmmunition - Federal 810 Game Shok 40-grain copper plated solid  \nMuzzle velocity - 1240 feet per second \nBallistic coefficient - 0.139\nScope height above bore - 1.5 inches \nZero-set distance - 60 yards\nTarget distance - 280 yards \n \nI used two ballistic programs. Both indicate a required adjustment of 35.2 MOA or a difference of 1.8 MOA between your field adjustment and the computed number. This difference is very likely due the ballistic coefficient number reported by the ammunition manufacturer. The ballistic coefficient can vary from barrel to barrel. Very likely your barrel is not the same as that used by the ammunition manufacturer in deriving the number indicted in the catalog.\n \nBy plugging your 37 MO in the ballistic program and adjusting the ballistic coefficient from the stated 0.139 to 0.141, I came up with 37 MOA - your field adjustment.

Now a days I am using Federal 712 Game Shok 38-grain copper plated Hollow point. There are three main reasons for using it,\r\n\r\n1-     It is useful on varmints, predators, small game and it pretty much resolve my issues with 810.\r\n\r\n2-     Of course prices.... there are few other ammo brands on my buying list but I prefer because of its price as compared to others. I bought 1000 rounds and paid 18000 PKR. Prices are high in PAKISTAN as compared to your side or any other.\r\n\r\n3-     The last major factor for using this is because I am concentrating on using only one kind of ammo for some period to become familiar with it. Its velocity, energy and some ballistic testing help me out if I would give it some time and left other for quiet a while.\r\n\r\nNow you calculate 35.2 moa at 280 yards. Mine actual reading was 36.07 MOAs with 0.131 ballistic coefficient at 50yards zero but with that I was getting some low on target and I have to add extra MOA to allign horizontally.', ''),

This particular cartridge in pictures is [B]SFM (Societe Francaise Des-Munitions) Anciens Etablissements- GEVELOT & GAUPILLAT[/B]\n\n\n[U][B].405 Winchester[/B][/U]\nThe .405 Winchester (also known as the .405 WCF) is a center-fire rifle cartridge introduced in 1904 for the Winchester 1895 lever-action rifle. It was the most powerful lever-action cartridge available until the .444 Marlin was introduced in 1964. This original Winchester factory load consists of a 300gr. soft point or metal patch (Full Metal Jacket) bullet at 2200 feet per second. \n\n[B][U].500 Nitro Express 3" Eley- Elephant Gun Cartridge[/U][/B]\nThe .500 Nitro Express is a .510 caliber (13 mm) big bore hunting cartridge. It was designed for use in single and double shot rifles. This cartridge is a 3 in (76 mm) version. The cartridge was designed for use against large dangerous game species in Africa and India.  \n\n[B][U].577 Nitro Express 3"[/U][/B]\nThe .577 Nitro Express is a rimmed cartridge in the Nitro Express series of big-game hunting ammunition. It is also known as the .577 Nitro Express 3". The .577 is notable as the standard caliber of professional ivory hunters in the 19th and early 20th centuries.[/quote]', ''),

(538340, ' PakistanFirst,\r\n\r\nYou are right and your calculations are similar with mine. I use 50yds for zeroing and you use 60yds.\r\n\r\nI know with the help of your earlier posts that 60yds trajectory is ideal. Using of 50yds zero is because of quick and easy calculation for MOAs.\r\n\r\nFor example, If my rifle is zeroed at 60yds and suppose I am hitting a certain target about 4" low then as we know that at 100yds 1 MOA is 1". And at 60yds 1 MOA is 0.6". Now I have to calculate that how many MOA I need to fit in 4". And it''s about 6.66 MOAs. This final calculation is not easy without calculator.\r\n\r\nBut Now see If my rifle is zeroed at 50yds and suppose I am hitting a certain target about 4" low then as we know that at 100yds 1 MOA is 1" and at 50yds 1 MOA is 0.5". Now I have to calculate that how many MOAs I need to fit in 4". And it''s about 8 MOAs. It is very simple to calculate and there is no need of any device. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now changing my zeroing from 50yds to 60yds, I have to just make 3 small clicks for (0.79 MOA) because my riflescope is of 1/4 MOA clicks. Isn''t that simple? \r\n\r\nIn my small game  shooting I only count 1" or 1.5" kind of low or up not like 1.33" or 1.82". So reasonable targets compensate extra few .xxx inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnlighten me if I am missing something. \r\nThanks.', ''),

Well Infact what you already have done is truely remarkeble. It is also fact that knowledge has no limits but in this thread your already posted topics are great source for those who want to learn shooting.\r\n\r\nI put myself as an example and want to share a little story. In my school going age, I loved to accompany my father in going out for some wing shooting. Since then I have a little interest in shooting and when ever I got a chance to meet experienced hunters I always questioned them about shooting. They always anwered me as they know depending upon their capabilities. As time went on I got interest in rifle shooting and come to know that good practice for shooting is .22lr but was unaware that what this hidden MONSTER is ?\r\n\r\nThis thread really worked out for me and when I got little familiar with .22lr I noticed that .22lr itself could be a fruit-ful passion. It gave me much more besides my unsolved questiones. Thanks (.22lr caliber) and thanks to all its lovers.\r\n\r\nOne thing which is annoying for me is that in our sweet country PAKISTAN there are lots of outdoors men but very few know the versatility of .22lr, And on the other hand when I surf the internet I observed that .22lr is first owned gun by every good hunter or shooter.\r\n\r\nI have some .22lr experiences and stories and would like to share in future. I also expect to get same response from others.', ''),

(538487, 'Home Department license --- who to blame for chai pani culture Well dear fellow enthusiasts and our beloved seniors. I am new to this forum and very proud that we have such a community who takes guns as these tools should be taken. Sports, Hunting, Self Defense and pride collection.\n\nIn our country getting guns is not so difficult as we all know but getting them legally is a hassle  so most of our fellow country men who are committed to get them in a legal way get them illegally (Chai pani or dealer way).\n\nI decided to go all legal took a lot of time but finally I paid Rs. 4530/- and got my computerized license without chai pani and source. :peace:\n\nThe actual story would be very long as it took me years :Cry: but I will tell the part from where the real process starts. \n\nAlso the story seems short but it took me days in every department I am making it all very short so more and more people get encouraged of going by themselves.\n\nAfter going here and there to lot of dealers who were asking 25k-35k for computerized license. I decided to go by myself. Went to HD the police man didn''t let me in cause it was 3:00 PM and the timings were till 12 noon. bad start.\n\nWent next day with the request letter for getting an arms license, my office card, passport, CNIC, NTN and salary certificate. Went into HD ask where is the Home Secretary office.\nwhy?\n for arms license.\n\nHe does not deal that, go to arms section officer.\nOoh why didn''t I see this panaflex Computerized arms license complete details written and documents needed. Said to myself looks pretty easy ahhmm.\n\nTried to enter SO arms office "kidher kis sayee milna hai"\nSO Arms.\nKia kaam hai.\nlicense banwana hai.\n\nWait.\nWaiting.....\n\nThe guy opened the door and closed it busy hain... WAITING..........\n\nFinally got my turn. Told SO that I want a new arms license are they closed no it was never closed only for elections. But I cannot issue it because I need the recommendation from Home Secretary sahib.\n\nWent back he is not there but go to additional secretary he will do it. \n\nWent there to my surprise people outside the doors are much like bunch of idiots and the person inside is a well educated one well dressed polite and helpful (off course he is commissioned officer and I guess cleared his exam on merit). \n\nTold him that I want a new license and I am not going to pay extra amount as this is my right and as a tax payer I should be able to get one easily. Had good chat with him and he finally endorsed my application and the form and sent me back to SO arms for further process. The rest should be easy. (__:tape2:__) got my data entry done and given the token. Paid the fees in Income tax NBP branch came back sir police certificate bhi lana hooga .... not again a new chapter opens here I said to myself. \n\nThen another hassle for verifications went from one office to another and you all know what I must have been through but finally all done went back to HD submitted the form. Police man who didn''t let me in the first day from him to many other in HD by now recognize me. One even did a favor, told me sir waisay hoota nahi hai magar hum app ka license jaldi print kerwa dayeen gayee and got it printed within a week.\n\nWell the actual procedure tells you go and get an illegal weapon all the criminals have them and are using freely in Karachi. \n\nI applied for three licenses but the approval was for only one so got one license will try for another after sometime.\n\nThe exercise shows that we are the culprits who have paid huge amount of money and created this dealer and some officials mafia.\n\nAtleast this community should encourage people to go by themselves and get it done, the benefit is that now I know that the license I have is purely legal and authentic. No chai pani which is legally haram hence illegal. Imagine you caught up for bribing an official. The culture here has taken this fear away from us. We are not so comfortable carrying illegal arms but ok for bribing. \n\nNext I will go for a 144 permit after I buy a good new handgun.\n\np07 Duty or EZ9 compact. \n\nBest of luck all who take this step I recommend please try for once, you''ll have something to say that I tried and DID/didn''t manage.', ''),

Likewise many of the well reputed car manufacturers have their specialized division working on this area like Mercedes, BMW ,Rolls-Royce and Bentley. Around the world the protection level is the measuring tool for gauging the protection needed.

We know MOI(Ministry of Interior) has given NOC’s to companies for retrofitting of ordinary vehicles to armored vehicles. It’s now a booming business in Pakistan having lot of ROI. But there is no law in Pakistan regulating this industry. Here i am not of the view that companies doing retrofitting here are not meeting the standards but i am of the opinion that there must be some official body to examine and make regular checks of the armoring processes these companies are using.

(538732, 'DIY: Shotgun Buttstock Shell Holder [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nOne of the best features of a shotgun is its ability to ward off an attack/intruder simply by its appearance. some say, nothing is more certain to an assailant than the typical "rack-rack" sound of a pump action that this resident packs one hell of a punch and the price of intrusion could be much higher than what was originally expected.\r\n\r\nThis is the intimidation factor that is part of the package when one owns a P/A shotgun. simply put: is anything more threatening than staring at the business end of a shotgun?\r\n\r\nThe more you think about it, you''ll recognize and start to admire this "intimidation factor" as it has the ability to resolve a potential conflict before it can materialize into something harmful or hazardous. isn''t this "conflict resolution" at its best?\r\n\r\nThen comes a question: How can we boost this "intimidation factor" in our P/A shotty to stack up more odds in our favor during a potential conflict? you guessed it right. Accessorize! and make your shotty look even more life threatening.\r\n\r\n[B]Before we begin little disclaimer as usual:[/B]\r\n\r\n[B][I]"The following content is for informational purposes only.

So .22inch rifles that are sporting i.e. semi auto or bolt and 7mm bolt are legal. 30-06, .308, 7.62x54r and 300 win mag bolt action all roughly come under 7mm and are thus NPB as well. In bolt guns anything that has a 7 in it will have a 7mm barrel diameter and if it is a bolt gun it will be NPB. \nFor Example: Remington 700 chambered in 7.62x51mm would be NPB since it is a bolt gun and barrel diameter is 7mm, where as the same Remington 700 chambered in 338 Lapua magnum would not be NPB, how ever people do register them onto NPB punjab licenses under the guise of them looking like a 7mm rifle, which is technically illegal but the home office has been fooled more often than not.

(538982, ' it''s not only about the calibre measurement all the time. for instance, a .22LR ammo performs very differently when in a bolt action pistol or a revolver as compared to an automatic recoil pistol like above. Again, the performance variables present a huge difference with the ammo velocity, weight, grains ratio, barrel length to name a few. For example, a .22LR Walther P22 would offer a shorter lethal range as well as weaker penetration when compared to a Ruger MKIII6 with *almost* doubled barrel length using the same ammo.\n\nLikewise, you can''t just compare the CZ92 with 2" barrel with any 9mm or .32 etc with twice or more a size of barrel, with thrice as much propellant/gun-poweder than a .25 ammo would carry. I believe, a 9mm or .32 with same sized jacket, same sized barrel and same amount of propellant ignited would hardly result around a 10% better than the given ballistics results when compared on "equal grounds".\n\nNo offense to anyone, that''s just my 2 cents on this and could be evolved by the time with the arrival of new information ;-)', ''),

That is what "playing with things" actually refers to.\n\nWhereas my weapons are concerned, for right now, I had been shooting a 50gr FMJ ammo on my Colt .25 ACP (i love to tell it''s 1917 made), now, i''ve acquired a top of the range velocity ammo that is 35gr and 1100ft/s. Now this increment in velocity would surely deliver a value in the same 2" barrel, the stock one, that for sure. But to enjoy the very line & length benefits, I''d require a longer (one 6" and another 8") barrels with tactically positioned compensation vents built-in. But since there aren''t no aftermarket addons like such, I''d have to go custom. The material would definitely be forged steel, further heat induced but i''d definitely finalize the grade after a thorough RND on metallurgy. That''s it for now.\n\nPreviously, I have hand-crafted (ISO standards, Alhamdolillah), and successfully enjoyed a variety of shushhhh-up stuff but since mentioning any illegality under the applicable ordinance and this forum''s ethics would be inappropriate, I''d show respect to the code of conduct even though I utilized most of the stuff beyond the Motherland''s jurisdictions.

I only fail to understand, if so, why are most guns available on market are twice and thrice, and in some cases five times more expensive than MRSP + duties?\n\nFor instance, the Glock 19 is just a USD 600 weapon (PKR 60,000/-) and with all taxes & shipping, handling etc expenditure, it costs ~100,000/- but is listed with dealer @ PKR 280,000/- (Asad of Sardar Adil Arms, and Chaudhry Arms) and in some cases, upto PKR 330,000/- whereas Taurus PT99, a USD 400 (PKR, 40,000/-) handgun is available at only PKR 75,000/- to 85,000/-. If you check most other handguns too, you''d notice for the price to be fluctuating without even a formula. Only a couple of brands are listed for like 4-5 times the cost meaning the importer to distributor to retailer profits incline to upto 400% at least. Is it so, or isn''t it? Only if so, doesn''t it make it a black-market already, monopolized in a twisted way by cartels involving a under the hush-up agreement?\n\nWell, i''m not being conclusive, just querying if anybuddy could expand the information spectrum for everyone''s better understanding?', ''),

(539222, ' The reason for high prices of European and US made weapons is restriction on export of these weapons to Pakistan imposed by EU and US. The dealers have to arrange special permissions from concerned departments which is time and money consuming. Even after obtaining these permissions, they are allowed to import limited quantity. These restrictions is quite relaxed when it comes to sporting weapons like shotguns and bolt action rifles. That is the reason, their prices are quite reasonable. It is another story that Pakistani Government don''t allow import of rifles and issue import permit in limited quantity which affects prices of rifles. But when it comes to pistols other than .22LR, they fall in the category of assault weapons thus making it difficult to get export permission from EU and US.\n\nSometimes, the dealers have to use other channels to import weapon into Pakistan like routing them from third country which again involves lot of money (import & export taxes, shipment costs), time and hassle. That''s why they charge premium on those weapons \n\nThat is the reason, the prices of pistols other than EU and US make (CZ, Taurus, Zastave, Norinco and etc) are quite reasonable.\n\nOn other hand, the money involved in getting import permit from Government of Pakistan also affect prices of weapons which dealers pass on to the consumers. So, basically it is not import duty which affects prices of weapons but other factors as well.', ''),

(539337, 'My official visit to Manila(Philippines)&amp;visit of two guns stores Hi dear fellows\nI spent my last week in Manila and some other parts of the Philippines also for technical visit to some waste water treatment plants being run in different parts of Philippines and this is some kind of new technology and we were in search of this technology for our textile export plant for Levi,s.Being a gun nut i could not control myself and i asked my host to arrange few visits to gunshops , he could only manage for the two of them so i went there and i thought i should share this with my beloved fellows on PG. I visited teo stores one was on some road i do not rembemer the name of the road but it was a factroy outlet of Shooter Arms Manufacturing (SAM) there brand name is SAM also and was managed my a women and second one was in a big departmental store named as Robinson like Metro or Makro here in Lahore.Before discussing these stores and posting the pics and awsome rates of different branded guns they told me i would like to share there gun laws and special role of private security guards etc.\nLicence in Philippines is difficult to get as in Pakistan these days they issue card licences only for 3 years and after that you have to get new card after every 3 years and fee is around 100USD for three years and if you want to carry you need separate permit that can b cancelled at any time due to some reasons like elections etc.Also not everyone is eligible for arms licence you have to prove to the authorities that you need a gun in true sense usually busnissmen \nand rich people who are really in need get licences.There are many private security agencies and they get licences of .38 special revolver,pumpaction or i only saw one Escort samiauto with a gaurd at the entrance of my hotel most of them have .38,wood rod and a handcuff too that was interesting that private guards having handcuffs but i was told that this is just show off,but i have seen these guys even controlling the traffic which i was told that it was also part of their duty somtimes.In my six days stay i only saw one police van equiped with M16 rifles and Glock17 pistols they usually do not come on the roads if they are not called.Most of people in some parts of the country keep illegal weapons even they guy who was assigend a driver to me have Smith&Wesson 9mm w/o licence so things are much like Pakistan.Now i will start with SAM i visited this shop on last Friday when i was there it was being managed by a women and girl women was around 36 and girl was around 22 .There total arsenal was few .45ACP 1911 pistols and few airguns in .22 calibre and very well build they shown me the pistol but not airguns because these were packed in PE packings.The women was not cooperating and then told her that i am also gun dealer back in Pakistan then she jumped in joy and called her boss in factory and he talked to me and offered me visit to my factory which i refused due to time shortage but took snaps of the 1911 in .45 ACP and airguns spare parts and bullets of .40 and .357 mangnum which i will b sharing shortly then i will tell u prices of Glock 17 and you will see the difference that how much we are being made fool by dealers in Pakistan.The price 1911 made by SAM was around 27000 Pesos and if we convert in Pak rupees it will be 64800 rupees.', ''),

(539373, ' [QUOTE=Leon;377204]The reason for high prices of European and US made weapons is restriction on export of these weapons to Pakistan imposed by EU and US. The dealers have to arrange special permissions from concerned departments which is time and money consuming. Even after obtaining these permissions, they are allowed to import limited quantity. These restrictions is quite relaxed when it comes to sporting weapons like shotguns and bolt action rifles. That is the reason, their prices are quite reasonable. It is another story that Pakistani Government don''t allow import of rifles and issue import permit in limited quantity which affects prices of rifles. But when it comes to pistols other than .22LR, they fall in the category of assault weapons thus making it difficult to get export permission from EU and US.\n\nSometimes, the dealers have to use other channels to import weapon into Pakistan like routing them from third country which again involves lot of money (import & export taxes, shipment costs), time and hassle. That''s why they charge premium on those weapons \n\nThat is the reason, the prices of pistols other than EU and US make (CZ, Taurus, Zastave, Norinco and etc) are quite reasonable.\n\nOn other hand, the money involved in getting import permit from Government of Pakistan also affect prices of weapons which dealers pass on to the consumers. So, basically it is not import duty which affects prices of weapons but other factors as well.[/QUOTE]\n\nMakes quite some sense concerning the EU and US made weapons. But again, all the recent lots of Beretta were imported from Turkey, the LEA lots inclusive, so the shelf price doesn''t justify the above situation, that''s where I see it black-marketing that involves pool-ups in a cartel way. Likewise, Glock is Austrian and is openly exported, directly from manufacturer, and further tree. Asad of Sardar Adil is a major handler  and is located almost right next to Major Sahb (the Taurus importer) in Bank Square, The Mall. The MSRP difference, I repeat, is just USD ~200 and the calibre is same. One sourcing agent is adding just a 35-50% premium and the other is charging like up to 500%, that is actually what I haven''t been able to understand. It is not (only) that i''m unable to afford a Glock at that much price, but it just doesn''t simply *justify* if you know what I mean. I''m unaccustomed to submitting to someone else''s rule, like... i don''t like to play the game by such messed up rules. If such tactics would disturb the cost-to-value ratio, I believe most would-be consumers would be at right to feel offended. Well, at least I can happily purchase a Desert Eagle .45 or 9mm for half a mil, but I won''t just flush my hard-earned money on a Glock for no reason but forced-digestion, that''s the concern I felt within and initiated this thread to see if it is only me unable to understand.', ''),

It is authentic that later Beretta itself adopted the feature-set from the Taurus PT92. To cut short, a *design patent* is not all that I look into guns for, I go for overall performance and skillset a gun, a friend has to offer, it''s always a package-deal and not brand-consciousness to me at least, I''m sure quite a number of gun enthusiast would agree. So, the bottom line, it doesn''t increase any value to me or convinces me to rate Beretta better than the equal similar with any other R&D oriented manufacturer of repute.

(539408, ' [QUOTE=OmErJamil;377355]Makes quite some sense concerning the EU and US made weapons. But again, all the recent lots of Beretta were imported from Turkey, the LEA lots inclusive, so the shelf price doesn''t justify the above situation, that''s where I see it black-marketing that involves pool-ups in a cartel way. Likewise, Glock is Austrian and is openly exported, directly from manufacturer, and further tree. Asad of Sardar Adil is a major handler  and is located almost right next to Major Sahb (the Taurus importer) in Bank Square, The Mall. The MSRP difference, I repeat, is just USD ~200 and the calibre is same. One sourcing agent is adding just a 35-50% premium and the other is charging like up to 500%, that is actually what I haven''t been able to understand. It is not (only) that i''m unable to afford a Glock at that much price, but it just doesn''t simply *justify* if you know what I mean. I''m unaccustomed to submitting to someone else''s rule, like... i don''t like to play the game by such messed up rules. If such tactics would disturb the cost-to-value ratio, I believe most would-be consumers would be at right to feel offended. Well, at least I can happily purchase a Desert Eagle .45 or 9mm for half a mil, but I won''t just flush my hard-earned money on a Glock for no reason but forced-digestion, that''s the concern I felt within and initiated this thread to see if it is only me unable to understand.[/QUOTE]\n\nBro! Austria is part of EU. So, the rule apply there as well. Glock does not export weapons directly to Pakistan due to embargo and I have exchanged mails with them in 2009. Regarding, Beretta, LEA can import small arms / weapon or small arms / weapons for LEA from any country and there is no restriction on that. Example: KPK Police is importing 5,000 Glocks directly from Austria through sole-agent based in Karachi. Regarding, Beretta imported from Turkey, please don''t forget to add import / export duties, middleman''s margin and shipment cots. Thus you are getting a USD 700 weapon in PKR 180,000.', ''),

(539420, ' I only doubt the precision shooting i.e. aiming and targeting functionality and you can''t trust on sights on a desi/darra/LK/hand-made gun be it a hand gun or rifle. Most would agree that this in particular is what requires an utmost level of mechanical-optical skillset as well as precise machining, no lathe, no levelling but a pure CNC.\n\nFTF and FTE are common issues with various import arms too and most of the times it is caused by a faulty spring or rust & rough surface at some edge. Not every owner is a keeper, and keepers know how to DIY it in just about a couple of minutes to fix such issues be it a local or import arm. So, this isn''t as much of a blame we put on locally crafted cheap versions.\n\nWe buy the top of the cheapest line Chinese stuff and then keep whining China produces the worst quality whereas it is the same China that excels in all electro-mechanics dozens of times better than our produce whereas consumer industry is concerned. China produces all qualities, some even outrun the German produce, yes they do, it depends on what the importer takes aboard with ''em.\n\nLikewise, when it comes to a locally crafted guns, we fear to buy expensive ones due to our own sceptics and end up purchasing the bottom line product for cheap bucks. Quality NEVER comes cheap, it NEVER does, swallow it! There are some Russian AKs that won''t melt down for as long as 500 rounds stress test, but there are some Russian AKs that would result a melt down for below 300 rounds. And then there are some Darra produced AKs that won''t melt down for as much as a 1000 rounds, literally. They just dump the barrel into water for a second and then start shooting again, yes, THEY have learnt the metal physics hard ways, inevitably, finally, and fortunately.\n\n[I]To all those whom it may concern[/I]: oh c''mon, stop whining like a cry-baby and for God''s sake put trust not into the abilities but the set of expertise we so have in dear motherland. Channelize it to the right direction, don''t just flood it out and make a waste. Pakistani Arms Industry has immense potential, we aren''t just willing to unleash the Asian Tiger as of yet!!!\n\nNow, let''s come back to SD hand guns that you may play plinking with but wouldn''t take to a range. I can tell you, I can always spend even upto 50k on a desi, custom-made for myself, on my terms, with my chosen metal combination, on my suggested spring set torque tested for stress in PSI even to decimals, and last but not least, the barrel with 30% inwards-from-top compensation vents, ejector and firepin of my choice. Besides the spring set, I guarantee you I wouldn''t go for anything not hand-crafted, if you see what I''m talking about!\n\nAll that you need to know to decide whether or not to go for a "designer" handgun is how much of the making process you can attend, simple ;-) Mark it, you need to know where you want to go, every road will take you there!', ''),

Illegal weapons are used in crimes not the licensed ones. It is the right of every free citizen to bear arms for his family’s and property’s defence. In a country like ours where the protection of common man is non existent, the right of self defence can not be taken away. The writer has referred to the tribal areas as law less areas because of weapons where as its the other way round, thefts, rapes etc are negligible in those areas. When the attacker knows that he might have to back his actions by his life he would think thrice before attacking someone’s honor or property.

"They fly in town, they get shot down."\r\n\r\n If passed, the ordinance would see one-year drone hunting licenses sell for $25, and there''s talk of a novelty drone-hunting festival to boost tourism.\r\n\r\n To Steel it''s a serious issue, however. "This is a very symbolic ordinance. Basically, I do not believe in the idea of a surveillance society, and I believe we are heading that way."\r\n\r\n The town board is set to vote on the ordinance on Aug. 6.', ''),
(539594, 'FAA warns public against shooting guns at drones WASHINGTON (AP) — People who fire guns at drones are endangering the public and property and could be prosecuted or fined, the Federal Aviation Administration warned Friday.\r\n\r\nThe FAA released a statement in response to questions about an ordinance under consideration in the tiny farming community of Deer Trail, Colo., that would encourage hunters to shoot down drones. The administration reminded the public that it regulates the nation''s airspace, including the airspace over cities and towns.\r\n\r\nA drone "hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air," the statement said. "Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in criminal or civil liability, just as would firing at a manned airplane."\r\n\r\nUnder the proposed ordinance, Deer Trail would grant hunting permits to shoot drones. The permits would cost $25 each. The town would also encourage drone hunting by awarding $100 to anyone who presents a valid hunting license and identifiable pieces of a drone that has been shot down.\r\n\r\nDeer Trail resident Phillip Steel, 48, author of the proposal, said in an interview that he has 28 signatures on a petition — roughly 10 percent of the town''s registered voters. Under Colorado law, that requires local officials to formally consider the proposal at a meeting next month, he said. Town officials would then have the option of adopting the ordinance or putting it on the ballot in an election this fall, he said.\r\n\r\nThe proposed ordinance is mostly a symbolic protest against small, civilian drones that are coming into use in the United States, Steel said. He acknowledged that it''s unlikely there are any drones in use near Deer Trail.\r\n\r\n"I don''t want to live in a surveillance society. I don''t feel like being in a virtual prison," Steel said. "This is a pre-emptive strike."\r\n\r\nHe dismissed the FAA''s warning. "The FAA doesn''t have the power to make a law," he said.\r\n\r\nThe FAA is working on regulations to safely integrate drones into the skies over the U.S., where manned aircraft are prevalent. The Congress gave the FAA until 2015 to develop the regulations, but the agency is behind schedule. FAA officials have estimated that once regulations are in place, thousands of drones will be in use across the country for a wide variety of purposes, from helping farmers figure out which crops need watering to tracking sea lions in remote rocky outcroppings to aiding search and rescue missions.\r\n\r\nBut the Deer Trail proposal is the latest ripple in a spreading backlash against drones. Dozens of laws aimed at curbing the use of the unmanned aircraft have been introduced in states and cities. Privacy advocates have expressed fear that police will use drones to cheaply and effectively conduct widespread surveillance without warrants.\r\n\r\nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a drone industry trade group, was concerned enough last year about people threatening to shoot down drones that it issued a statement warning that such comments were "irresponsible, dangerous and unlawful."\r\n\r\nMichael Toscano, president and CEO of the group, expressed similar concerns Friday, saying drones "are being designed to serve the public good....The myriad of important uses will be imperiled if they become targets. ... The suggestion that Americans take up arms against unmanned aircraft also endangers citizens on the ground."', ''),

(539617, ' Hello Brother Leon,\r\n\r\nYou have asked a question for PakistanFirst and I am also still waiting for his reply for your particular question.\r\nIn fact it is a question that so many people asked. For relevance one can read PakistanFirst''s post "Shopping for Rifle Scope? How Will You Decide Which One to Buy?”\r\n\r\nI Hope that PakistanFirst will soon enlighten us further. Anyhow, I would like to share my thoughts with you, if you don''t mind?\r\n\r\nFirst thing is your budget. Obviously, if you could afford Honda Civic then why buy a Suzuki Mehran. Both are cars but with lot of differences in their qualities. Such is also the case with riflescopes. You mentioned that you have CZ-455 Standard. Its latest in .22lr from CZ and is a great gun. I don''t know its exact price. I bought its earlier model CZ-452 Varmint couple of years ago from Orion Arms Lahore in 65000 Rupees. I think you must have paid above that. Make any purchase by keeping your firearm''s worth in mind.\r\n\r\nSecond thing in my mind is that you will use it for hunting activity mainly as you asked. When I am hunting with .22lr, a problem I often came across is magnification because my riflescope is Redfield revolution 3-9x40mm.  Maximum magnification of my riflescope is 9X and I still have problems for long shots on small targets and the maximum magnification you told is 7X so I am little concerned for your long shots on small targets. So please keep this point in mind. Don’t get me wrong that I do not prefer rim-fire riflescopes, they are good and they get the job done in fewer amounts. But keep in mind, buy 12X magnification riflescope atleast.\r\n\r\nFor both of my above mentioned points you can simply view youtube videos and see for yourself that guys who love .22lr sports really used high magnification and good reputation riflescopes.\r\n\r\nI have also review a Nikon P-22 2-7 X 32 mm BDC 150 scope riflescope which you mentioned and its reticle but I have some my observations which I will share with you in my next post.\r\n\r\nPlease stay in touch and enjoy your CZ-455 .22LR', ''),

(539724, ' @s.jawad, I talked to both Khyber Arms (yesterday) and Moonstar Arms (Haji Islam-ud-Din) today, I''m not sure if Khyber Arms have have a CNC setup of their own but Moonstar has it, and the good thing is, the frames and slides of Beretta and other major clone kits CNC precision milled in forged-alloy castings (most probably 6061 T6 or 7075; both are aircraft grade billet alloy), the glide, trigger assy, ejector and pins are forged-steel. I talked to Saif, and couldn''t confirm the grade the barrel is made of, but it''s most probably the 316. Only the pre-finishing surface DA and DE polishing are run prior to assembling, which is manual. IMO, the overall frame incl. slide and lower carrier are reliably good-to-go. Sights are 1:1 to original, and accurate. Moonstar offers a lifetime warranty too, Khyber Arms offer one year warranty.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them has STLM mechanism to test coil spring for load & tension values for deflection, compression, displacement at the moment. None of the springs has an exact & accurate PSI figure, and they were unable to provide me any. In their routine SOPs, they evaluate by experience and state that it''s give-and-take the same. IMO, provided a post-purchase upgrade- [I]in compliance with the slide weight & travel differences[/I]- would increase the functionality, usability and reliability to upto 99% in comparison.\n\nBottom line, upgrading this Moonstar/Khyber/Frontier Arms Beretta clone with *genuine* Beretta replacement Part No. 1, 6, 13, 18, 38 and 55 with around USD 184.9 which includes $125 for original Beretta barrel) would actually, and literally bring to you a SD/HD handgun in 1:1 ratio perfection, originality and peace-of-mind i.e. totalling PKR 39,999 or less. I think it''s worth giving it a shot, I will!\n\nplease drop me your email on ********* so alongwith @Leon, I could discuss further to this, as I''d be needing your assistance when I visit Peshawar.', ''),

Then today i called Orient, and P.A.R.A both of them told me that they don''t have any pistol of .22lr/.25acp.

In a country like ours where the protection of common man is non existent, the right of self defence can not be taken away. The writer has referred to the tribal areas as law less areas because of weapons where as its the other way round, thefts, rapes etc are negligible in those areas.

Illegal weapons are used in crimes not the licensed ones. It is the right of every free citizen to bear arms for his family&#8217;s and property&#8217;s defence. In a country like ours where the protection of common man is non existent, the right of self defence can not be taken away. The writer has referred to the tribal areas as law less areas because of weapons where as its the other way round, thefts, rapes etc are negligible in those areas. When the attacker knows that he might have to back his actions by his life he would think thrice before attacking someone&#8217;s honor or property.

(540267, ' @Ameer Bro\n\nI would disagree with you on that.\n\nAlthough the EZ9 (or CZ999) do seem to share a lot of physical resemblance with the Sig P226, they differ in several aspects. For one, none of the parts (not even the sights, to my knowledge) are interchangeable. Even grips that are designed for the Sig P226 will not fit on the EZ9 due to its ambidextrous de-cocker. Heck, even the holsters won''t fit!\n\nAs far as my knowledge, the design of the CZ99 (the grand-daddy of the EZ9) was "influenced" by the Sig P226 and the Walther P88. There''s a good picture on the internet with all three guns together and it really shows how the EZ9 is quite a bit different from a Sig P226, at least far from a true copy as you said. \n\nThe Norinco NP22, however, is a Sig Clone. \n\nTo the OP: The Zastava series pistols (CZ99, CZ999, EZ9) are all tried, trusted, and battle-proven weapons. They are built like the proverbial tank and are fairly accurate. I''ve held and fired both weapons, and the Viking (in my opinion) doesn''t even come close in terms of fit, finish, and accuracy. Don''t forget that Zastava has been producing firearms for over 150 years! It is a highly respected manufacturer.', ''),

For one, none of the parts (not even the sights, to my knowledge) are interchangeable. Even grips that are designed for the Sig P226 will not fit on the EZ9 due to its ambidextrous de-cocker. Heck, even the holsters won''t fit!\n\nAs far as my knowledge, the design of the CZ99 (the grand-daddy of the EZ9) was "influenced" by the Sig P226 and the Walther P88. There''s a good picture on the internet with all three guns together and it really shows how the EZ9 is quite a bit different from a Sig P226, at least far from a true copy as you said. \n\nThe Norinco NP22, however, is a Sig Clone. \n\nTo the OP: The Zastava series pistols (CZ99, CZ999, EZ9) are all tried, trusted, and battle-proven weapons. They are built like the proverbial tank and are fairly accurate. I''ve held and fired both weapons, and the Viking (in my opinion) doesn''t even come close in terms of fit, finish, and accuracy. Don''t forget that Zastava has been producing firearms for over 150 years! It is a highly respected manufacturer.[/QUOTE]\n\nI respect and agree with your logics, and then i will come back to my post as i said i will prefer 446 on personal liking. Secondly, i said it a copy on first instance and then for shashka added the clone word ........... ;) \n\nI Agree on Zastava reputation but i am not worried about that Russian company either making 446, its an icon in itself too. We dont get PYa (ofcourse better than 446), since this 446 is another version of PYa that differs in frame material and barrel quality. But produced by the same manufactures.

Now let me tell you short recent story. I bought the VEPR for 120K. I was in local market of Peshawar city to buy cover and one Afghani guy came to see my gun. He told me that this is a very hot item in Afghanistan and was being sold at around US$1800 few months back and these days it is around $1200. I saw on net the price in difference countires was ranging from $1400 to $1800. So no need to worry.

(540837, ' [QUOTE=OmErJamil;377705]@s.jawad, I talked to both Khyber Arms (yesterday) and Moonstar Arms (Haji Islam-ud-Din) today, I''m not sure if Khyber Arms have have a CNC setup of their own but Moonstar has it, and the good thing is, the frames and slides of Beretta and other major clone kits CNC precision milled in forged-alloy castings (most probably 6061 T6 or 7075; both are aircraft grade billet alloy), the glide, trigger assy, ejector and pins are forged-steel. I talked to Saif, and couldn''t confirm the grade the barrel is made of, but it''s most probably the 316. Only the pre-finishing surface DA and DE polishing are run prior to assembling, which is manual. IMO, the overall frame incl. slide and lower carrier are reliably good-to-go. Sights are 1:1 to original, and accurate. Moonstar offers a lifetime warranty too, Khyber Arms offer one year warranty.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them has STLM mechanism to test coil spring for load & tension values for deflection, compression, displacement at the moment. None of the springs has an exact & accurate PSI figure, and they were unable to provide me any. In their routine SOPs, they evaluate by experience and state that it''s give-and-take the same. IMO, provided a post-purchase upgrade- [I]in compliance with the slide weight & travel differences[/I]- would increase the functionality, usability and reliability to upto 99% in comparison.\n\nBottom line, upgrading this Moonstar/Khyber/Frontier Arms Beretta clone with *genuine* Beretta replacement Part No. 1, 6, 13, 18, 38 and 55 with around USD 184.9 which includes $125 for original Beretta barrel) would actually, and literally bring to you a SD/HD handgun in 1:1 ratio perfection, originality and peace-of-mind i.e. totalling PKR 39,999 or less.

I saw a 92FS clone yesterday at a local dealer and the finishing was good in and out (inspected the gun all opened) and barrel looked good too but your technical knowledge surpasses mine and these dealers. The dealer did inform me that 1 or 2 manufacturers now have the kits to make exact clones for the 92FS, so you are correct that it is most likely some parts they skimp on to keep the prices low for local buyers. I, like you, wouldn''t mind paying 40K for a near perfect clone with critical 92FS''s original parts in it. As for barrel, most american gun makers use a specific scaled RC hardened 416SS as 316SS is cheaper and easier to drill and work with. Original barrel will be ideal.\n\nSent you a friend request.

Went to Saeed Book store (F7 Markaz), picked up Acrylic Fluorescent paint tubes (large tubes, PKR135 each) and 3 x size 0 and 1x size 1 brushes (PKR25 each). Original White sites are not fluorescent but these are. Orange fluorescent paint was out of stock as someone had picked up every tube they had!\n\n@doc pistol bh: It is a simple diy job. I cleaned the inner area with the medical alcohol wipes and then lightly scratched the to be filled area for the acrylic paint to stick. Acrylic sticks well to the metal and hardens quickly so avoid water based paint. Take the brush, pick up a suitable amount of paint from the tube and fill the sites fully (no air gaps etc). It is okay if it is an overfill as that can be cut out and removed later with a very sharp tip knife/blade as acrylic paint can be cut when dry - if you overfill too much then clean it all with a tissue. I''ll get some close-up pictures with a proper camera, these were taken with the tablet. I was able to get the exact maroon colour for the safety as well, as one side did the runner too! Hence 4 brushes. I had considered using medical syringes (plenty of doctors in family!) to fill the paint but brushes were fine for the job. With the syringes, one doesn''t get overspill however more paint is wasted along with the syringes and acrylic paint is quite thick so wider syringes would have been required. Brushes can be cleaned and reused with a thinner. \n\n@Ameer bh: Thanks :)\n\n@Nazim bh and eminentpk bh: Yes, pink is interesting and ''innovative'' :) .... I have flourescent Green too but didn''t go for yellow rear and green front combo as front site (for me) needs to be of a totally different colour. Ideal would have been fluorescent Orange for front and fluorescent green for rear but lack of Orange lead to the current combo. Zastava M57 sites will get similar treatment after I have had a little more practice with the small drill as rear sites are flat on M57.', ''),

(540897, ' [QUOTE=Verve;378818]Sir, I am based in ISB and would really appreciate your assistance in sourcing a custom made Beretta clone as you described above - willing to travel with you to Peshawar as well. I saw a 92FS clone yesterday at a local dealer and the finishing was good in and out (inspected the gun all opened) and barrel looked good too but your technical knowledge surpasses mine and these dealers. The dealer did inform me that 1 or 2 manufacturers now have the kits to make exact clones for the 92FS, so you are correct that it is most likely some parts they skimp on to keep the prices low for local buyers. I, like you, wouldn''t mind paying 40K for a near perfect clone with critical 92FS''s original parts in it. As for barrel, most american gun makers use a specific scaled RC hardened 416SS as 316SS is cheaper and easier to drill and work with. Original barrel will be ideal.\n\nSent you a friend request. Thanks.[/QUOTE]\n\nBro, I have reached some info on this by talking to a couple of manufacturers in extended details, the barrels they''re making are already 316ss and good for around 700-1000 bullets, just like any other weapons. Once you''re done with the original barrel, you can then get yourself an Beretta replacement part (~$100 to ~125, widely available). For now, only the guide spring would suffice.\n\nAgain, it''s not just the kit, esp. KAC and Moonstar both have the ISO standard CNC setup the frames, slides and other major parts are manufactured by. Until I compare the rest, I''d rate for KAC to be the top of the line. Yes, I have scheduled a visit with it''s GM Mr. Ayyaz and Fida Afridi as they have been very supportive through the while, I might be visiting Islamabad before Eid and would, in the same trip, go to Peshawar, so yes, we can surely go together.\n\nIt''s not only about a cheaper-than-regular stuff, I''d highly, and eagerly entrust our own people and our own economy than just living in complexes knowing nothing following just ''the trend''. So yeah, let''s give it a go and try out, I think it''s worth it.', ''),

I talked to Saif, and couldn''t confirm the grade the barrel is made of, but it''s most probably the 316. Only the pre-finishing surface DA and DE polishing are run prior to assembling, which is manual. IMO, the overall frame incl. slide and lower carrier are reliably good-to-go. Sights are 1:1 to original, and accurate. Moonstar offers a lifetime warranty too, Khyber Arms offer one year warranty.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them has STLM mechanism to test coil spring for load & tension values for deflection, compression, displacement at the moment. None of the springs has an exact & accurate PSI figure, and they were unable to provide me any. In their routine SOPs, they evaluate by experience and state that it''s give-and-take the same. IMO, provided a post-purchase upgrade- [I]in compliance with the slide weight & travel differences[/I]- would increase the functionality, usability and reliability to upto 99% in comparison.\n\nBottom line, upgrading this Moonstar/Khyber/Frontier Arms Beretta clone with *genuine* Beretta replacement Part No. 1, 6, 13, 18, 38 and 55 with around USD 184.9 which includes $125 for original Beretta barrel) would actually, and literally bring to you a SD/HD handgun in 1:1 ratio perfection, originality and peace-of-mind i.e. totalling PKR 39,999 or less. I think it''s worth giving it a shot, I will!\n\nplease drop me your email on [email]oforomer@gmail.com[/email] so alongwith @Leon, I could discuss further to this, as I''d be needing your assistance when I visit Peshawar.[/quote]', ''),

Went to Saeed Book store (F7 Markaz), picked up Acrylic Fluorescent paint tubes (large tubes, PKR135 each) and 3 x size 0 and 1x size 1 brushes (PKR25 each). Original White sites are not fluorescent but these are. Orange fluorescent paint was out of stock as someone had picked up every tube they had!\n\n@doc pistol bh: It is a simple diy job. I cleaned the inner area with the medical alcohol wipes and then lightly scratched the to be filled area for the acrylic paint to stick. Acrylic sticks well to the metal and hardens quickly so avoid water based paint. Take the brush, pick up a suitable amount of paint from the tube and fill the sites fully (no air gaps etc). It is okay if it is an overfill as that can be cut out and removed later with a very sharp tip knife/blade as acrylic paint can be cut when dry - if you overfill too much then clean it all with a tissue. I''ll get some close-up pictures with a proper camera, these were taken with the tablet. I was able to get the exact maroon colour for the safety as well, as one side did the runner too! Hence 4 brushes. I had considered using medical syringes (plenty of doctors in family!) to fill the paint but brushes were fine for the job. With the syringes, one doesn''t get overspill however more paint is wasted along with the syringes and acrylic paint is quite thick so wider syringes would have been required. Brushes can be cleaned and reused with a thinner. \n\n@Ameer bh: Thanks :)\n\n@Nazim bh and eminentpk bh: Yes, pink is interesting and ''innovative'' :) .... I have flourescent Green too but didn''t go for yellow rear and green front combo as front site (for me) needs to be of a totally different colour.

Glock''s win is also a loss for [B]Smith & Wesson[/B] ([URL="http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/stock-price?Symbol=SWHC&ocid=qbes"]SWHC[/URL]), which had supplied the APD for the past 70 years.\n\n[/LIST]\n\n\n\n\nGlock wouldn''t say how much its contract is worth. But a company spokeswoman told [URL="http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/23200043/article-Lock-and-load---Marietta--Atlanta-police-departments-ready-to-reload-with-Glock-guns?instance=home_business"]The Marietta Daily Journal[/URL] that the fourth-generation Glock pistols, the type involved in the contract, retail to the public for between $599 and $734, although law enforcement receives a discounted purchase rate.\n\n\nGlock [URL="http://us.glock.com/news/release/glock-secures-atlanta-police-department-as-newest-law-enforcement-customer/"]says[/URL] about 65% of U.S. law-enforcement departments now use its pistols, a remarkable accomplishment for a company that started manufacturing firearms only [URL="http://glock.pro/glock-pistols/358-glock-pistol-history-evolution.html"]in the 1980s[/URL].\n\n\nGlock took the gun world by storm when founder Gaston Glock came up with an innovative design for a semiautomatic pistol using lightweight plastics and other synthetics. \n\n\nThe Glock is also easy to fire and maintain. And while an old-school revolver typically holds six shots, a Glock -- depending on the magazine used -- can handle up to 19 rounds, giving police the additional firepower they were looking for.\n\n\nThe gun also caught on with the American public. It was seen in TV cop shows and movies. In "Die Hard 2," Bruce Willis'' character gives a [URL="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf8sC_1deyM"]short speech[/URL] about the advantages of the Glock. References to the guns also kept popping up in rap lyrics, and by the mid-1990s Glock sold more than a million of its guns in the U.S. alone, according to this [URL="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41046787/ns/business-world_business/t/americas--year-love-affair-glocks/#.UfE4sW0pjMi"]2011 report[/URL]. \n\n\n\nAccording to an [URL="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147036107809.htm"]extensive 2009 article[/URL] on the company by Bloomberg Businessweek, Glock''s estimated profit margin on its pistols runs around 68%, and it has sales of [URL="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-07-23/opinions/35489738_1_gun-culture-gaston-glock-gun-control"]about $100 million[/URL] annually in the U.S.\n\n\nWhile supplying law enforcement, Glock has had some brushes with the law also. The Businessweek article noted the company has long dealt with allegations of widespread corruption, as well as a failed contract assassination attempt on Gaston Glock by a former business associate.\n\n\nBut controversies aside, it doesn''t appear Glock will be relinquishing its hold on its place in U.S. law enforcement. \n\n\n\n"We believe Gliock offers a trusted, superior firearm for our officers," Atlanta Police Chief George Turner said in a company [URL="http://us.glock.com/news/release/glock-secures-atlanta-police-department-as-newest-law-enforcement-customer/"]press release[/URL].

(540984, '22LR - Leupold, Nikon &amp; Redfield Scopes This post discusses the Leupold Rimfire VX1 2-7X28, Nikon P22 2-7X32 and Redfield Revenge 3-9X42 scopes. All three manufacturers are well established and are respected brands. Redfield is now a part of the Leupold enterprise. I called Leupold, Nikon Sport Optics and Redfield to validate the specifications of their scopes to give an informed advisory. I have not personally used any of the mentioned scopes.\n \nBeside the mechanical and optical quality, other factors need to be considered in purchasing a scope.  Brightness at dawn and at dusk is low. If your shooting involves low light levels, you want a scope that offers relative high brightness. This factor is derived by dividing the objective lens diameter (in mm) by the power factor of the scope. This gives us the exit pupil diameter.  Pupil diameter of the human eye changes depending light condition. In low light, the pupil will dilate to 7 millimeters. A scope with a relative brightness of more than 7 will be of little benefit. On the other hand if you want to use scope in low light, a scope that gives you higher relative brightness would be valuable.     \n \nKeep in mind that the magnification markings on the scopes may not be accurate in all instances. Actual magnifications of each scope at low and high power appear in the table below. Following are the relative brightness level computations at the actual low and high power magnifications. \n \nLeupold at low power - 28/2.4 = 11.67; at high power 28/6.7 = 4.12\nNikon at low power 32/2 = 16; at high power 32/7 = 4.57\nRedfield at low power 42/3 = 14; at high power 42/8.6 = 4.88\n \nAll three scopes offer more than adequate relative brightness at low power. At high power, the Redfield has an advantage. Under the criteria I mentioned earlier, let us compute the maximum magnification of each to achieve relative brightness level of 7. \n \nLeupold, 28/7 = 4X. Nikon, 32/7 = 4.6X. Redfield, 42/7 = 6. For a less string criteria - relative brightness of 5, Leupold computes as 28/5 = 5.6X; Nikon as 32/5 =6.4X and Redfield as 42/5 as 8.4X.\n \nComputed relative brightness is not everything.  A scope may be described as “coated”, multicoated” or “fully multicoated”. On a “fully multicoated” all lens surfaces receive multiple layers of coatings. A “multicoated” may possibly have multicoating only the lens surfaced exposed to air. Other surfaces of the lenses in this type of scope may not have any coating or just single layer on inter lens surfaces.  All three scopes mentioned in this  article are fully multicoated.\n \nHigher magnification scopes make the target appear closer. This advantage is at the expense of smaller linear field of view (FOV). Linear field of view is the width of view at a given distance.

For this reason the parallax is adjusted for short distances - 60 yards in the case of Leupold and 50 yards for Nikon. The Redfield is designed for center fire rifle. For this reason, Parallax is set for distance of 150 yards. If your eye can be aimed directly at the center of the eyepiece, then parallax is of little concern.\n \nLeupold VX1 2-7X28 LR Duplex reticle is described here on page 21.\n [URL]http://www.leupold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BAS_Inst_Manual_17July12.pdf[/URL]\n \nNikon P22 2-7x32 is available with the BCD 150 or the Nikoplex reticle. The ranging systems of these two scopes are totally different. \n \nNikon scope with the Nikoplex reticle (Rapid Action Turret Technology) is furnished with two elevation turrets One turret is for standard velocity is for standard velocity (1200-1300 f/s) ammunition and the other for hyper velocity (1500-1640 f/s) ammunition. You place the appropriate turret on the scope and sight it for any distance that is marked on the turret. Thereafter you rotate the turret to any other desired distance marked on the turret. For ammunition with velocities between 1300 and 1500 feet per second, you can use either turret. But to get the proper setting for such ammunition, you can access Nikon Sport Optics web site to use their program that will furnish the number of clicks that need to be counted for proper turret settings.     \n \nThe turrets are marked in 25-yard increments from 50 to 150 yards. Bear in mind that if you want to aim the rifle scope to any “in-between” distance marked on the turret, you would have to count the turret clicks (marks) to make the appropriate up or down adjustments. Since the two turrets are for a range of ammunition velocities instead of a single velocity, you are bound to get errors. This error can be easily validated by using a ballistic calculator. \n \nNikon scope with the BCD 150 reticle has four open circles for 75, 100, 125 and 150 yards. The standard crosshair is deployed for 50-yard distance target. Nikon BCD 150 reticle is described here: [URL]http://www.nikonusa.com/fileuploads/pdfs/BDC_manual.pdf[/URL]\n  \nIt is possible that the P22 2-7X32 with Nikoplex reticle may have the wrong turrets. Here is the link to that advisory from Nikon. [URL]http://www.nikonsportoptics.com/Service-And-Support/Service-Advisories/P-22-2-7X32-NikoPlex-Riflescope-Service-Advisory.page[/URL]\n \nRedfield offers four reticle styles  for the Revenge scope. Redfield Revenge 3-9X42 is described  here: [URL]http://www.redfield.com/redfield-revenge/[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.redfield.com/_media/downloads/redfield_3-9x42.pdf[/URL]\n \nAfter reviewing all the information that I collected from the manufacturers, I am inclined to go for the Nikon. What I do not like is the fact that elevation and windage adjustment per click is coarse. The Nikon turret are not click-type, but friction-type. When you rotate the turrets, you do not hear clicks. The turrets have markings on the dials. Each move of one mark on the dial equates to ¼” at 50 yards and ½” at 100 yards. To me, this is a big handicap. The Luupold has the lowest relative brightness at low and at high power. The Redfield is not only the heaviest but also the longest. Redfield’s parallax setting at 150 is not appealing to me for a 22LR rifle.\n \nIf my choice is limited to the Leupold Rimfire VX-1 2-7X28, Nikon P22 2-7X32 and Redfield Revenge 3-9X42, I would first visit a sporting goods store that carries all three scopes and have a first-hand look. At this point in time I am inclined to go for the Leupold. Not mentioned here is the factor of price. This factor may sway me away from the Leupold towards another scope that is not even discussed here. If the store has other scopes, I would also take them into consideration before making my final choice.', ''),

(541056, ' [QUOTE=OmErJamil;378878]Bro, I have reached some info on this by talking to a couple of manufacturers in extended details, the barrels they''re making are already 316ss and good for around 700-1000 bullets, just like any other weapons. Once you''re done with the original barrel, you can then get yourself an Beretta replacement part (~$100 to ~125, widely available). For now, only the guide spring would suffice.\n\nAgain, it''s not just the kit, esp. KAC and Moonstar both have the ISO standard CNC setup the frames, slides and other major parts are manufactured by. Until I compare the rest, I''d rate for KAC to be the top of the line. Yes, I have scheduled a visit with it''s GM Mr. Ayyaz and Fida Afridi as they have been very supportive through the while, I might be visiting Islamabad before Eid and would, in the same trip, go to Peshawar, so yes, we can surely go together.\n\nIt''s not only about a cheaper-than-regular stuff, I''d highly, and eagerly entrust our own people and our own economy than just living in complexes knowing nothing following just ''the trend''. So yeah, let''s give it a go and try out, I think it''s worth it.[/QUOTE]\n\nI have purchased both Moonstar and KAC weapons. \n\nThe moonstar lasted around a dozen roudns or so.

Furthermore it is not easy to submit DN and all the remaining process it takes time which most of us dont have plus days off work.\n\nFor me all dealers are UNRELIABLE but again my request is if some gentleman know the person / dealer etc. who do it as it should be done please let us know give his contact no etc. \n\nWhat I have observed at Nila Gumbad arms market most of the dealers contact a single person I never tried but must approach some guy like that to cut the middle man ( Dealers ) share and he should not be interested from where you buy your weapons.\n\nSeniors plz help, I know people on this forum that own more than 30 licenses and still there licenses are coming every month or so, they must have some reliable source. So plz sharing this thing will help us.\n\nBecause once the licenses are open I and many others are going to apply. But I never want myself or anyone else to suffer.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nBro! Resubmission of DN is the most easiest part as they don''t ask for your ID at this stage and anybody can do this on your behalf. However, to collect the Card and Supplementary documents, you will have to travel to Islamabad. BTW, the dealer charge for entire package. The most difficult stages of the process are from getting approval for license to issuance of DN. after that things become easy.\nYes! The dealers play role of middleman only as the person arranging the license are different and we usually don''t know them. Even if you know them, it is your risk.

If it is imposed to ban carrying of weapon in any state then you need permit. But if 144 is imposed on display of weapon, then you don''t need permit to conceal carry or carry in your car. As stated above, legally police cannot search you car but they do it. This is all Chai Pani arrangement. Legally, they cannot register any case against you and even they do so, that will be decided in first hearing. But none of us want to go through this hassle. Secondly, the permit displayed here is just a letter to authorities to inform that there is no restriction on conceal carrying and it is not a permit. No permit is required in Punjab.

(541525, ' Bro! Semi Autos are mainly for Hunting, waterfowling to be precise. If your primary objective is hunting and secondary is skeet / trap, go for semi auto and Baikal 153 or Hatsan Escort Magnum Luxano are good guns.\n\nIf primary purpose is skeet / trap, you should go for Over Under shotgun. Although skeet and trap two different kind of guns but if you buy only one gun, get sporting version. You will have to adjust yourself but it will support you in both purposes. And this gun can be used for waterfowling as in waterfowling, one do not move much so weight of gun won''t create any issue. Secondly, the sporting version will be heavy which will help in recoil issue as well. In over under Baikals are very good guns.\n\nYes, for hunting 28 inch barrel is enough and it is enough for casual skeet / trap. If priamry purpose is skeet / trap, go for longer barrels e.g. 31 inch. Sporting version has loger barrels which also help you in waterfowling.', ''),

On the other hand if you want to use scope in low light, a scope that gives you higher relative brightness would be valuable. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the magnification markings on the scopes may not be accurate in all instances. Actual magnifications of each scope at low and high power appear in the table below. Following are the relative brightness level computations at the actual low and high power magnifications. \r\n\r\nLeupold at low power - 28/2.4 = 11.67; at high power 28/6.7 = 4.12\r\nNikon at low power 32/2 = 16; at high power 32/7 = 4.57\r\nRedfield at low power 42/3 = 14; at high power 42/8.6 = 4.88\r\n\r\nAll three scopes offer more than adequate relative brightness at low power. At high power, the Redfield has an advantage. Under the criteria I mentioned earlier, let us compute the maximum magnification of each to achieve relative brightness level of 7. \r\n\r\nLeupold, 28/7 = 4X. Nikon, 32/7 = 4.6X. Redfield, 42/7 = 6. For a less string criteria - relative brightness of 5, Leupold computes as 28/5 = 5.6X; Nikon as 32/5 =6.4X and Redfield as 42/5 as 8.4X.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of your post was on above theory but when you made your final selection you ignored it all the way.', ''),

(541536, 'CZ Rami - Sight Adjustment and 14 Round Mag Woes! Please advise. I just bought myself a CZ Rami a few days ago as I was in need of a sub compact and this felt the best way to go. \n\nTook it to the Gun Club on Saturday, loaded it with chinese red box and wanted to shoot from 10 or 15 yards. The range master disagreed and told me I could only shoot from 25 yards. My argument was that new gun, 3" barrel, sub compact and myself being only a recreational shooter will not be able to do much at 25 yards. \n\nAnyway, I took the gun and let the first shot rip. The recoil was quite smooth and much less then expected. Another 4 shots and I walked to the target to see the result. Lo and behold - a 2.5" group from 25 yards with a brand new gun. I was shocked to say the least. And mightily impressed by the Rami. \n\nWent back and shot another 5 - another 2.5" group. More amazement. And internal screams of joy. :)\n\nAnyway, all bullets were hitting about 5-6 inches left of the center mass - at 25 yards. If I aimed 5-6 inches right I was dead center. Can any of the seniors guide me as to how to adjust the sights and how much should I move it? Mine came with the TruGlo sights and I believe the rear should be adjustable for windage. Please help.\n\nSecondly - as in previous Rami posts - the 14 round mag does have an issue. If the mag is fully loaded the 3rd of the 4th round FTE''s. If only 10 or 11 rounds are put in the mag works well. Any senior members know what I can do to correct this issue?\n\n- Usman\np.s.

And then the big importers of these specific weapons (people in real power - not the puppet governments - usually etc) come in play and they take a big chunk of their margin because people are willing to pay a premium to own such weapons.\n\nTurkish, CZ and Brazilian weapons are on import quota and come through normal channels where customs clearance charges (taxes and duties) AND bribes are added and usually a few importers take orders from normal dealers to place one large order. 1 order can be placed from one country at a time only so sometimes you see shortage of Turk guns or Taurus or CZ etc. Then the importer(s) delivers to dealers their orders. A normal dealer shop makes up to 8k max for a sub 100k pistol/shotgun. Dealers all claim to be importers but handful are actual but with low quantity, even in this channel the big guns are controlling and they don''t sell direct to public (unless you are a best buddy of one).\n\nSome or many of you know this already and I won''t post the link of the site ... from there you can source any (and I mean ANY) type of weapon and ammo and it is delivered to your doorstep without you doing anything other than paying and opening your door to collect the package, and to any part of the world.

(541606, 'House Robbery This happened a few months back, just getting around to posting it now.\r\n\r\nI live in DHA, Lahore and was out of city over a weekend with family. When I came back, around 11 pm in the night, I noticed the main door had been broken, the wood slab that has the handle had been smashed to unhinge the locks. I called DHA security, since I dont have much faith in our police. I waited outside the house for them, not knowing if someone was still in.\r\n\r\nThey came fairly quickly, although the armed old timer had the longest double barrel I have ever seen. Looking at that gun, I was afraid more so for him than the robbers since it provided no maneuver room for him in a closed area like a house. Anyway, I led the way into the house and we found that no one was there. The main bedroom had all the wardrobe belongings thrown down and searched through. The rest of the house was clean ie didnt look as if someone paid much attention there.\r\n\r\nShortly after, a few policemen arrived. They looked as if they had just woken up, no pun intended. I gave them a guided tour of my house as well. They told me to come to the police station next day and have an FIR registered and left.\r\n\r\nThe worst part was that my CZ-999 and about 30 rounds of bullets were stolen. I didnt care much for the usual cash and jewelry, although they were significant in terms of monetary amount. The only reason I had left the gun at home was that my computerized license had expired and didnt want to have a weapon with me in that situation.\r\n\r\nLong story short, we suspected it was someone from the house workers or one from the neighbors (the ones that always love to sit outside and observe other houses). However I didnt name anyone suspect in the FIR and the person assigned to inspect it questioned our maids and then wanted to throw our poor gardener in jail along with the neighbors servants.\r\n \r\nI felt if the police did their usual activity we could get to the culprit but the whole process revolved around punishing our workers without first determining guilt, some of whom had been with us for some time and I feel are honest people. I also heard from others about how their gardeners are now on the ''maskook list'' ie everytime something happens in the city, the poor souls get thrown into jail to show progress. So I decided to stop cooperating and just ignore their requests for further interrogation of our workers. The policeman was pissed at me and in the end said, dont open an FIR if you''re not willing to go through with the investigation.\r\n\r\nI now have a alarm system installed with a local security firm and think its a decent investment to stop at least the entry level thieves.', ''),

(541644, '.22lr training pistols ! [COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande][COLOR=#000080][B].22 Training Pistols: Pros & Cons[/B]\n[I]by Todd Louis Green[/I][/COLOR]\n\nUsing a .22lr pistol as a training aid is nothing new. Conversion kits for 1911-pattern guns have been around for a very long time. In the revolver world, rimfire equivalents to full size duty guns go back even further. A major resurgence of .22 training has come about in response to the 2009 ammunition shortage. SIG-Sauer and other companies now offer factory OEM conversion kits for their most popular pistols. Other companies opt for a dedicated training gun like the upcoming S&W M&P pistol in .22lr or the well established Ruger 22/45.\n\nThe twenty-two can certainly be a beneficial tool. A .22 pistol eliminates most of the recoil and blast that can be so intimidating to beginners. For more experienced shooters, the substantially lower price of .22lr ammunition often provides the means for more live fire practice than one might be able to afford with centerfire 9mm, .45 Auto, etc. There are also times and places where a .22 — especially a suppressed .22 — can be used but larger, more powerful, louder pistols might not.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind when practicing with a .22-cal equivalent to your normal pistol is that the .22 has essentially no recoil. Ten year old children can easily tame the kick and muzzle rise of most .22lr pistols. From a training perspective, what this means is that the .22 is not suitable for any training that focuses on the speed of firing multiple shots at a single target. Do not trick yourself into believing otherwise.\n\nFar too many people sacrifice grip and proper sight tracking while simply going spasmodic on the trigger of a twenty-two. Then they falsely believe they can shoot a serious duty or carry gun faster, as well. Instead, that person has started to form bad habits that will actually diminish his speed when handling a centerfire pistol.\n\nSkills you can work on effectively with a .22 equivalent to your normal pistol:\n\nmarksmanship\nstrong- and weak-hand only shooting\ndraw stroke\nreloads\ntransitions\njudgmental shooting\nshooting on the move… With SOM, the line between good .22 training and bad .22 training is definitely easy to cross. But like transition drills, SOM training can benefit from a .22 in terms of learning how to move your feet and position your body for a stable shooting platform on the move.\nSkills you should not practice with a .22lr handgun:\n\nrecoil management\nsight tracking\nrapid multiple shots on a single target\nfailure drills\nAlso, the more similarity between your .22 trainer and your standard pistol the more beneficial certain drills will be. While you can get marksmanship benefit from shooting almost anything, having the same trigger system and sights (or better yet, the same identical trigger and sights) will obviously translate into more direct skill building. A heel magazine release and single stack magazine is not giving you 1:1 benefit for your button release double stack pistol reloads. Malfunction clearances with an Advantage Arms .22 conversion kit will be more helpful than doing similar drills with a Ruger 22/45. And so on.\n\nA .22lr training pistol can be an effective and economical way to practice many handgun fundamentals, but misused it can also lead to a very false sense of proficiency. By keeping in mind what a .22 can and cannot mimic, both the beginner and the dedicated shooter can wring real benefits from a sub-caliber practice pistol.\n\n\n[I]Source pistol-training[/I][/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#323D4F][FONT=Lucida Grande][/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

Once you got the permit, you need to contact an arms dealer who will arrange import for you. They charge good money for this service. Now there is another complication which is trade embargo on export of weapon imposed by European Union (Germany and Spain are part of EU). And as I told you earlier, your friend cannot send you the weapon. In this situation, it is up to dealer that from which source the dealer arrange gun for you. Once the gun is imported, you will have to pay all the taxes and duties levied by government. In the end, you will save few bucks but you will have to go through lot of hassle. So, it is economical to buy gun from market unless you are after some very special thing which is not normally available in market e.g. Custom Made shotgun or rifle or pistol.\n\nIf you belong to LEA and are going on official foreign visit, you can get import permit and then contact the dealer in country you are visiting or somebody in ebassey who will arrange export permit on your behalf  then you can bring the gun with you on your way back home.', ''),

In other cases, the vendor owns everything, and you just provide shelving.\n\n Fourth, contact your tax authorities and find out if there are any special or supplementary taxes that apply to your business, and how often you have to file.  \n\n Fifth, find out if you''re required to have insurance, and how much it will cost, and how often it must be paid.\n\n Sixth, find out if what you''re selling has special regulations concerning who you can sell to, and what kinds of records, if any, must be kept.\n\n\n You might also scout around and see if there''s a similar business already in Karachi, that might be interested in a partner or investor.  Buying a piece of an already-functioning business will let you see how things operate without (hopefully) surprises from the authorities, and let you assess the local market.  After a year or so you could decide whether you wanted to open a store of your own.[/QUOTE]\nThank you brother', ''),

Breakdown of first 300 is as follows:\n \nThe first 200 round were fired alongside brand new never fired 4 Sig P226s by current and ex-army personnel who bought these Sigs together. Targets were upper half human size. First 50 were just to get to ''know and feel'' the guns and next 150 shots were rapid fires and up to 75 meters, my Stoeger won hands down on target hit counts against every Sig in 25m, 50m & 75m - we started with 25m and moved longer in distance to 50m to 75m and finally to 100m. At 100m 5 rapid fire was last test (single handed only, no second hand support under the mag), 1 sig and my stoeger hit the target with 1 bullet each. I don''t claim to be a sharp shooter but against seasoned shooters with brand new Sigs, if Stoeger performed that well from new then I don''t consider it to be a risk. \n\nAt a private 8 kanal remote ''range'' to train my other half on Stoeger, PT99 and MKA1919 shotgun, it was all 100 shots rapid fire at 2 head size empty metal paint cans (filled with bricks and rocks to keep them in place and stable) with A4 paper glued/taped to it for hit counts after every 30 rounds and paper replaced, at 75m distance and 6ft height and it had shattered the bricks. In that test, PT99 was used too (100 rapid rounds again each) but site adjustments were not getting right so lots of off target (hence replaced with PT92 within 2 weeks after that).. This test was filmed with video cam on tripod with just the cans in focus. My mrs loves the Stoeger as she found it way more accurate and hated the PT99 even though it has a lot less recoil.\n\nIn my humble opinion, my SC is now a hard run from new break-in completed pistol with 250 rapid shots. If something was to give, 150 rapids in first day of use would have shown something or weakness signs at full strip and clean after both target tests. As for target shooting, the circular 0-9 target paper is a very good benchmark but for a layman as long as his/her pistol''s fired bullet can hit a head (a normal paint can size) from a good distance (75m is quite an SD distance) by not one but 2 (me and mrs), then this Stoeger is good enough and minimal/reduced risk to CC.', ''),

You may want to check if this has the inner auto switch, as this could be trouble being caught with the gun if you plan to CC it.\n\nAs for cutting an original AK47 barrel, that is usually dishonest dealer sales pitch, utter nonsense and BS I have heard enough times. Honest dealers will tell you straight up that there are no line production guns with AK47 cut barrels.

On top of that, AK47 is for .30cal, not 9mm so even if the manufacturer is stupid enough to make losses )as per the calculations above), he would need to drill and rifle the barrel for 9mm use.', ''),

And then the big importers of these specific weapons (people in real power - not the puppet governments - usually etc) come in play and they take a big chunk of their margin because people are willing to pay a premium to own such weapons.\nTurkish, CZ and Brazilian weapons are on import quota and come through normal channels where customs clearance charges (taxes and duties) AND bribes are added and usually a few importers take orders from normal dealers to place one large order. 1 order can be placed from one country at a time only so sometimes you see shortage of Turk guns or Taurus or CZ etc. Then the importer(s) delivers to dealers their orders. A normal dealer shop makes up to 8k max for a sub 100k pistol/shotgun. Dealers all claim to be importers but handful are actual but with low quantity, even in this channel the big guns are controlling and they don''t sell direct to public (unless you are a best buddy of one).\nSome or many of you know this already and I won''t post the link of the site ... from there you can source any (and I mean ANY) type of weapon and ammo and it is delivered to your doorstep without you doing anything other than paying and opening your door to collect the package, and to any part of the world. But price is minimum 3 times or more (than it would cost in their native manufacturing countries) and these guys only deal in gold as money!!!! And they use state of the art encrypted portal for quotations, orders and payments system.[/QUOTE]\n\nAli Bro, I think after Verve''s explanation now I understand that other countries are responsible for that price hike.

(541957, ' Naseer bro, I''ve worked for a few blue-chip technology companies and there are export bans of their high end hardware and software products to Pakistan, Iran and so on. For lower tech hardware & software, they need permissions too. Another company''s revolutionary software is not allowed to be sold to Pakistani owned companies. Obviously I can''t put names of these companies here as every forum is tracked by the powers who control the likes of google and so on. Heard of google being banned for a while in China and reasons? Heard of how much private data was stolen in europe by google vans that provide google map down to 360 street level images - and EU reacts with a gentle slap on the hand. And youtube ban in PK is benefiting who really - PK media owners and anchors are ecstatic because of youtube ban and so is the establishment along with many others. I digress.\n\nHowever a lot of banned hardware and goods do get in through indirect channels, especially routing through various ports (container changes etc etc) and countries around the globe hence making it very difficult for such goods to be tracked. This pushes the prices up a lot as there are a lot of cash-in-hand payments made in the process. There are serious players who do all this channelling work.\n\nBack to topic .... PX4: by professionals the range, accuracy and endurance/torture testing required (as a genuine 92FS has been through hence it is a highly respected pistol warranting a very high price due to very low supply). Until then, in my view, it''s just a fancy version of Stoeger with Beretta logo on it and a show off price tag of 350k+. Galaxy S4 and S3 are much better phones than iPhone5 in every department yet iPhone is 25%+ more expensive. Samsung 10.1 Note Tablet is better than current iPad and people continue to buy iPhone5 and iPad even when they are infested with issues that make them inferior products for the price tags, why .... status symbol! Same status syndrome applies to PX4 until it is really tried and tested - even then it wouldn''t be worth it''s current price tag. No offence to those who own PX4. Zigana T (LEA) is a way sexier pistol, and it is LEA designed to operate full auto and PX4 is not even LEA grade. Price difference ....', ''),

(541985, ' Interestingly enough, the mobile crime scene van did come to my house for fingerprinting. They attempted to take off fingerprints from a number of items, but I felt it was flawed for a number of reasons:\n\n1. The original policeman I dealt with said I can use the house as i wish. I asked about fingerprints and they were like naaa, not going to be taken or something\n2. The assigned investigator however did bring in the fingerprinting guys, but by that time some of the items had already been handled by me\n3. They took a lot of fingerprints of items that can retain prints, ie glossy flat surface items etc. No idea what happened to those as they never came back with names of individuals and if I knew them or not. My follow up questions on the fingerprints leads me to believe its more of a formality, possibly helpful in a court case where someone is being prosecuted rather than in pulling up the identity from NADRA\n\nIf I were to venture into a guess, the theft wasnt committed by the worker themself, but by someone whom they provided detailed information about the house etc. We were going out of town, so it was obvious to 4-5 workers that we wont be around for a few days. The act of breaking a door is not something a normal houseworker is capable of doing, they dont have the nerves to do this without fear of a neighbor catching them from the noise wood breaking makes \n\nThis was a professional. He scaled a wall, then uses a crowbar to break open the door by first chipping into the middle part of the door to dislodge the first lock and then inserting the crowbar in the lower part of the door to act as a lever against the remaining door lock. I''m betting he was in within 10 minutes of scaling over the wall. And he scaled the wall back to leave since I had locked the gate and it was still locked when I came back.

(542044, ' [SIZE=3]Dear all,\nI maybe a newbie here but my career has seen "actually using" quite a bit of 9mm handguns (most of them purchased out of my own pocket). PX4 is lovely weapon. Like a singer whose every song is not an ultimate hit, same goes for virtually every brand in every category possible out there. Every product has its own pros and cons. Most of the cons are re-worked after post trial usage at the hands of actual real world users. Hand guns are no exception. \n\nBefore I proceed further, please check out the following link:\n[/SIZE][URL]http://www.berettausa.com/products/stoeger-cougar-8000f/[/URL]\n\nOkay, now, as far as comparison goes, while working "mostly" on the same principals, PX4 and Stoeger Cougar are both different guns aimed at different markets. The Cougar has evolved. Quality control is also dictated by the brand or company responsible for overseeing their original product produced at the hands of a [SIZE=3]subsidiary company. In this case Beretta (Parent Company) and Stoeger (Subsidiary). Metallurgy DOES matter here (Italian vs Turkish) and while I fully support the fact that Stoeger Cougar passes and meets the stringent quality control tests laid down by Beretta while reducing the price tag just for marketing and sale purpose (blah blah) I can''t guarantee if both companies cut few corners in the manufacturing process. Still, in this case, the Cougar must be meeting the standards of Beretta if not exceeding like the PX4. Either way, its your budget and "want vs need" that matters while choosing both which are equally capable guns. Testimony needed? I''ve owned a PX4 and three S/Cougars. Never, ever encountered a single problem with either. Consistency wise (Not Accuracy which is debatable) both give you best bang for the buck. But one "has to be" slightly better than the other in any category, may it be finishing, mag capacity, accessories, customizable etc. Having said that, the PX4 has been intentionally priced higher to S/Cougar due to advanced design and few improvements. You may also consider this marketing tactics. Like a BMW 7 Series has to outperform BMW 5 Series. Both get the job done but you mostly get what you pay for.[/SIZE]', ''),

(542092, 'CZ 75 TS (Tactical Sports) - Project LiteSpeed Salam All,\n\nIts been a while since I posted a new project.  I have been up to stuff, some of no importance but am always fiddling with guns, my guns specifically.  Sometimes I laugh about it as those few who know me have decided to label me as a thinker tinker; and that I can''t leave well enough alone.  I am of the firm belief that only God is perfect and everyone/thing else could use some sort of modification(s). \n \nI have always wanted to have this this way or that that way when it comes to firearms.  Once done, I get bored and since I am not rich, I have to dispose of that unique item and move to the new idea.  Take for example my previous project: convert the CZ 75 TS into a CzechMate BUT with the option of being able to use a compensator with a front sight. \n [URL]http://www.czforum.com/index.php?topic=1116.msg6666#msg6666[/URL]\n[URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?8698-Evolution-Cz-75-ts&highlight=[/URL]\nHaving done that project, I again went back to the basics by purchasing another Tactical Sports.  I had just been shooting the TS and thinking about what is next.  Then one day, a friend was visiting from abroad, he has a bunch of AWESOME weapons; he bought them over to the Gun & Country Club for shooting.  In our region we do our range shooting mainly at 25 meters (27 yards) at ISSF targets - single handed in events.  Sounds easy right?  Ha!  I don''t care if one can lift 50 lbs dumbbells 50 times for shoulder presses... try to simply hold 1.5 KG dumbbell straight out like you are going to shoot for 1 minute and then see how bad your hand shakes.  At least mine does.  I shot the Sig Mastershop X6, 9mm, 25 rounds and not bad but the group could have been better.  It should be noted that prior to shooting this gun I had been shooting Air pistol for about two hours.  Having said that I then shot with my CZ TS, 9mm, 25 rounds, and I still shot a better group than the X6.  I also tried the same thing with a HK USP ELITE, 9mm, 25 rounds and wow an even better group.  Why?  Because the gun was lighter, trigger was crap compared to the X6 or TS but the gun was still manageable due to lighter weight.  There at that moment a new project came into being.\n\nLike all my projects, I tend to think of names to call that pistol.  I was suggested/adopted  ''Anubis'' for the previous project.  For this project the name suggested to me was ''StripTease''... lolz.  I can just hear the laughter everywhere.  I finally decided on ''LiteSpeed''.  So how to lighten?  Two options: A.  Build a new Slide & Frame in either (Titanium or 7075 T6 Alloy) - a slightly expensive option (maybe a surprise later in the year).  B.  Start shaving, slotting, and cutting everywhere.  For now, option B was the flavor.  So, how much do I shave and where?  How big and long do I mill the slots?  What portions are not needed; hence cut them off?  Lastly and MOST importantly who has done this before and would they be kind enough to help me?  The answer to the last question was YES... Yippee! \n \nI would like to thank the following for their help in assessing my thoughts and giving me the ''ok'':\nCZ CUSTOM - Rob Bagnato \nCajun Gun Works - David Milam\nCheely Custom Gunworks - Matt Cheely\n\nOff I went and bought Carbide and TiN coated 8mm (ball end), 5mm (ball end), 3mm (ball end), and other cutters (end mills) with the same dias..  Mind you - I never knew these things are EXPENSIVE.  We started off cautiously as I never really knew how much metal is hidden where.  So initially I shaved the slide by only .5mm.  Then put a bevel in it with the ball end going in by another 1mm.  I then proceeded to slot the guide rod housing with the 8mm end mill.  The first end mill broke and had to use the second one which also finally did give way but got the job done.  Whoa!  there is TOO much metal on this thing... its everywhere... this is a very MEATY gun.  I proceeded to chop the front end off as I had see on the CZ Custom CTS.  After that I removed the BS checkering and slotted the grip.  I went back to the slide more aggressively and slotted out the bevels.  Then I realized that I had changed the balance of this thing due to excessive lightening in the front.  Well why not the rear where there is at least 4mms worth of metal around the firing pin.  I started to shave the slide there and also bevel more aggressively.  Whilst at it, I decided that to further reduce the recoil, I will port it... and did so with 3mm ports.  I have a set of variable power recoil springs coming from Wolf.\nTo make a long story short I have reduced the weight by about 190 grams - take off another 60+ grams if you revert the following parts back to OEM: grips back to stock wood, plastic guide rod, plastic guide rod plug, plastic magwell, stock windage only adjustable sights.  I like it just fine like this so it also looks good.  Btw, did you all know that all the internals including the custom grips and stuff amounted to .5 KG?\n\nSo, why not a CZ SP01 Shadow?  It literally weighs the same and logically is less accurate due to a smaller barrel.\n\nOk, so why not a CZ P01 Phantom, its only 800 grams?!  It is an ideal gun again for carry because of the lesser length barrel; however, this thing still attracted me to where I wanted to do a marriage of the TS with Phantom till I saw that its frame has small rail sections rather than full rail.  So much for love.\n \nWhats next?  The firing report/result.  I am awaiting recoil springs; should be here in a few days.  What do I expect?  I am expecting a more tighter snappier recoil which feels less when shooting due to low reciprocating mass.  The subject of lighter verses heavier guns is debatable; but having already experienced excellent results from my Glock 34 I know this should be the same.  Here is something below I found on the internet and have copy/pasted below.\n \n[B]Effects of a lighter spring:[/B]\n- Recoil is transferred to the shooter in a shorter duration of time because the slide is moving at a higher velocity.  This is often perceived as less recoil and reduced muzzle flip.\n- With a lighter spring the shooter also has less force to counteract, or you don’t have to work as hard.  This usually reduces muzzle flip.\n- Less force to counteract reduces the odds of producing a limp wrist style jam.\n- A lighter spring will result is reduced muzzle dip when the slide closes keeping sights steadier and on target for a faster follow-up shot.\n- Light springs are particularly helpful to smaller shooters like children, women or anyone else having trouble keeping their wrists locked. \n \n[B]Effects of a Heavier spring:[/B]\n- Recoil is transferred to the shooter over a longer duration of time due to lower slide velocities.\n- Slower slides equal a longer recovery time for the shooter.\n- The shooter does more work, as there is more force to counteract.

(542313, ' My thoughts on the Caracal C/F with the following experience: I have handled, repeatedly fired the relatively new weapon. Have exchanged ideas with other Caracal owners and dealers. Have read reviews extensively but NEVER BOUGHT ONE TO BE OWNED AND TRUSTED!!\nThe gun is a relatively newcomer to the world of old dogs. It will take its time to evolve and re-evolve before it can be safely trusted. It has been designed positively but lacks quality control and most importantly extensive R&D. Anyone buying a Caracal now or IMHO 3-5 years down the road is to be considered an early adopter. You see, a gun takes much much more than just "fancy specs" like computer manufacturers who get everything (researched and tested) from Intel, AMD, WD, Seagate, Foxconn, Asus, Gigabyte etc etc etc.\nGun making involves a host of factors from the team of designers/engineers to the machinery/tools used in the process, from Research and Development as per todays standards/tomorrow''s requirements to metallurgy involved. So and so forth.\nNames like Glock, HK, Sig, Colt, Walther and Browning etc etc didn''t become instant hits overnight (though some were lucky right from the first step they took). So its no fault of Caracal itself but I personally feel they got hasty in targeting the market. Anyways time will tell.', ''),

(542351, ' PakistanFirst,\r\n\r\nAlright, I give you some pointers. Not only regarding scope selection but also with that particular post of yours.\r\n\r\nYou answered because Leon bro asked you about scope selection for his CZ-455 standard. Leon needed it for the purpose of hunting. He also mentioned some scopes which he came across while searching and was not fully aware of their advantages and disadvantages for the purpose he intend to use it.\r\n\r\nYou took some time, contacted manufacturers and inquired them about those particular products. And then came out your advise for Leon. You gave some information mainly about their light transmission factor along with field of view and also compared those products in these catagories. In the end you simply went for better brand among them.\r\n\r\nMy concernes are,\r\n\r\n1-        Why didn''t you came out with some extra meaningful answer as Leon only required some hunting scope for his .22lr. You definitely narrowed Leon''s options for just sticking in only those three specific scopes. Although you knew for sure that Leon can get much better scope than those three.\r\n\r\n2-        You only went for specifications and points which are written in their brouchers and not touch those issues which company would not want to write like their disadvantages in the field. If brouchers are every thing then it is an easy job for everbody to obtain it and why ask experties.\r\n\r\n3-        Your post is written in formal way. I am sure there is plenty of material available on the internet on any issue. Purpose of this forum dies if we don''t share our personal views and experiences informally.  \r\n\r\nI know for sure in the field Leon would definitly experience lack of magnification. For example when he will be in a situation like this, He would want to take a shot on duck at 120yards landing just farther to the decoys and in this situation only about 30% of the body will be visible in the rivers of Pakistan. And at this point he would want a head shot but his scope magnification will prevent him from doing it.\r\n\r\nI also think that range adjustable scope with easy turret control would take him to the new heights of sport shooting with .22 Long Rifle. In doing that he would also need a Rangefinder along with .22lr, good scope and proper ammunition.\r\n\r\nI thing my post is also getting long and I don''t want to getting you bored more. So I will be in touch.\r\nMay be I am not right with my observations but tell you that I am always in the phase of learning.', ''),

Took a while so went and bought a dremmel with polishers etc. Now the bullet moves very smooth into the barrel, even the HPs. And it fires the federal & American Eagle HP crap ammo too without any FTF & FTE. Will strip it again and completely remove the gap between slider and barrel (all with dremmel this time for precise and balanced finish) so it will be polished all the way as most barrels are. That should completely eliminate any future FTF(feed) due to this shortcoming on feed and barrel mouth design by German engineering. I am very surprised that they released a product with such issues - Germans, along with Japanese are best in engineering top quality products. They did, however, fix many things the older model required fixing (from P22 bible) though so left them as is.\n\nMade some other modifications too, specific ones being the trigger slider mechanism''s rectangular frame that has sharp edges and scratches the polymer (as it did within first 7 rounds), and rounding the hammer edges. One left to do is polishing the striker pin as .22lr is mostly black powder and a filthy round that clogs the striker pin slider over time, causing FT fire. Will do the pin polishing later to take very very fine layer off both flat sides.\n\nI''m assuming you''ve not done any internal mods?\n\nAnd why not a SS or hard chromed nut for the barrel as more and more bluing is coming off when removing it :tsk:\n\nOriginal laser to purchase now. Lahore buksh elahi have them but they are asking 4k than my local dealer can source - original is made in China. Peshawar dealers, I wonder, if any stock them. Also need barrel inserted laser ''bullet'' to align the rail laser, both for .22lr and 9mm sizes.', ''),
(542377, 'Hard Chrome the Cougar or not? Salam All\n\nI love my SC but the bluing finish is not good and bubling in some places so I''m looking for options. Barrel bluing has already been removed, a long while back. So that will definitely need to be hard chromed to stop rust. Hard chroming is the best solution for scratch & permanent rust resistance, polishes to mirror shine and it will out last the life of the gun.\n\nDealer says not to as serial number markings will disappear and it will reduce the value. Value I''m not bothered about but legality I am, especially as its a daily CCW. Is it legal to change serial number placing on a gun in PK as I''d prefer to hide these numbers out of site for them not to be copied and used on another pistol for illegal purposes. Friends and sometimes their friends target fire in private ranges together and I''d rather hide the serial number than allow it to be copied - I prefer extreme caution when it comes to guns And then there''s the issue of hard chroming filling the very fine serial numbers on rail and frame.\n\nWant it engraved too but not all over and in few places only, to give it a bit of originality and a personal touch.\n\nHard Chroming I can get done from Pindi in front of me and to the specifications for it to not mess up the tolerances and hence the functionality of the pistol.\n\nYour thoughts?

Handguns in particular are very, very restricted and difficult to own.\n\nThe laws over here are complex, but for rifles, we are allowed most calibers, but no automatics or semi automatics except .22LR and .22WMR. \n\nWe can also reload our own ammunition, again with some restrictions..\n\nWhen not in use, all firearms and ammunition must be stored in steel security cabinet.\n\nFor deer hunting (we call it stalking), we mostly use bolt action rifles in calibres like .243win, 6.5x55mm, .308win and .270win. \n\nThere are no additional licenses needed to hunt deer, you just need permission off the landowner who''s land the deer are on. There is commercial hunting, but many hunters form a small group and try to lease the hunting rights on a forest or farm ect as it works out cheaper that way.\n\nWe also have a small number of feral goats in the mountains and a small but growing population of Wild Boar..\n\nThere is also a lot of bird shooting using shotguns ie pheasants, grouse, pigeons ect but I do not do that.\n\nFinally we can hunt small game such as rabbits fox and hares. These are hunted with either rifles or shotguns, while some people hunt rabbits with airguns, by ferreting, or with dogs..\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter', ''),
(542440, ' [QUOTE=Verve;380355]Jawad bro, I had FTF (within first 8 rounds fired - was expecting it after all the reviews) due to the sharp barrel edge and larger than usual gap between slider and barrel so out came the 200, 320, 400 grit papers and a polisher. Took a while so went and bought a dremmel with polishers etc. Now the bullet moves very smooth into the barrel, even the HPs. And it fires the federal & American Eagle HP crap ammo too without any FTF & FTE. Will strip it again and completely remove the gap between slider and barrel (all with dremmel this time for precise and balanced finish) so it will be polished all the way as most barrels are. That should completely eliminate any future FTF(feed) due to this shortcoming on feed and barrel mouth design by German engineering. I am very surprised that they released a product with such issues - Germans, along with Japanese are best in engineering top quality products. They did, however, fix many things the older model required fixing (from P22 bible) though so left them as is.\n\nMade some other modifications too, specific ones being the trigger slider mechanism''s rectangular frame that has sharp edges and scratches the polymer (as it did within first 7 rounds), and rounding the hammer edges. One left to do is polishing the striker pin as .22lr is mostly black powder and a filthy round that clogs the striker pin slider over time, causing FT fire. Will do the pin polishing later to take very very fine layer off both flat sides.\n\nI''m assuming you''ve not done any internal mods?\n\nAnd why not a SS or hard chromed nut for the barrel as more and more bluing is coming off when removing it :tsk:\n\nOriginal laser to purchase now.

(542508, '22LR - You Have One Ammo Type - How Can You Improve Performance? Many in the 22LR kingdom have one rifle and use only one type of ammunition. Can performance be improved with this combination?  The answer - yes . Assumption here is that your shooting skill does not vary from one shot to the next.  You ask - how ? Read on.\n \nWeight of 22LR ammunition can vary from one cartridge to the next cartridge coming out of the same box. This is due to manufacturing tolerances.  Inconsistency of weight may be due to the bullet, propellant (powder), brass cartridge, primer coating or combination of these parts. These variations can change the velocity from one cartridge to the next cartridge.  This velocity variation is the culprit of inconstant results from one shot to the next shot.\n \nTarget ammunition manufacturing processes customarily are held to closer tolerances than the ordinary garden-variety 22LR ammunition. Buying expensive target ammunition is no assurance that such ammunition will provide better accuracy over common variety of ammunition. See my prior post on this topic that is referenced below.\n \nSince bullet weight the heaviest part in a 22LR cartridge, it lends itself to biggest weight variation of all components that make up a cartridge. The design of the 22LR cartridge is such that we can not take out bullets from the cartridges in order to determine their weights and in turn sort them by weight. The next best thing is to weigh the cartridges and sort them by weight. Cartridges of same weight will tend to give similar and more consistent results.     \n                                                                                  \nSmall Chinese-made digital scales are ideal for sorting 22LR ammo. They are small enough to put in shirt pockets. At this end they cost about $10. They are readily available on eBay from sources in China and Taiwan. You can share the purchase with friend to cut down your out-pocket outlay.  \n \nRelated posts:\n#7 22LR - Sorting Ammo by Weight\n#19 22LR - Which 22LR Ammo is Best?\n#27 22LR - You Discovered Best 22LR Ammo - Really?\n#226 22LR - Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands\n#233 22LR - Minimizing &#8220;Flyer&#8221; Shots\n#274 22LR - Ammunition Variability\n#294 22LR - Accuracy Really Elusive?\n#448 22LR - Exchanging Gifts & 22 Long Rifle Ammo\n#499 22LR - Improve Your Ammunition\n#525 22LR - Higher Price Ammo Assure Higher Accuracy?', ''),

I used S&B magnum 12x76 (54 grams) in VEPR but for HD as  I used to load/unload quite often (sometimes not with very quick and hard bolting) thus after few times the round would get jammed during first loading; due to twisted front end of round (see pic right side 3 rounds). My experience suggests NOT to reload round say more than 2 to three times. One reason for bad front of round is due to the fact that S&B round does not has perfect circle shape and has relatively softer edges thus higher chances of causing it to jam while bolting thus causing the front end to become sort of damaged!\nI read somewhere (trying to find again the webpage) that use perfect circular shape round for VEPR and not like that of S&B! The S&B 12x7 (54grms) round to me has a shape of octagon and not a perfect circular shape! Today I bought LG/SG (extreme left white) of Shaheen, SG of UK (mid) and slug (turkish) at top most white.

(542823, ' Dear all - some updates after my last post. I tried (loading & unloading operation without any fire) for the first time in my VEPR-12 Turkish Slug and SG (Shaheen and UK made). No jams encountered so far! Summary:\n1. In past I had jams during loading the first round into barrel (was using S&B, 12x76, 54 grms, Magnum). Slow loading (bolting) seems one reason that caused jam. One has to be cruel in loading :) i.e. load with great speed and force - Dr_Gilani do not forget it is the VEPR the beast - NO mercy! :)\n\n2. As discussed in previous post the shape of S&B Vs (Slug and SG). My honest opinion is that you can live without a perfect circular shape (like S&B) BUT probability of failure to jam during first loading would increase, especially if the same round is loaded for 2nd, 3rd or more time. However, the perfect round shapes like I showed for Slug and SG/LG are MUCH more better and very low probability of failure.\n\n3. \n(a) I first loaded one Mag with all 8 Turkish slug - did loading/unloading operation of ALL 8 without any issue at all - it was indeed like a breeze!\n(b) Then I loaded 2nd Mag with all 8 Shaheen LG/SG rounds- did loading/unloading operation of ALL 8 without any issue at all - it was indeed smooth!\n(c) Then I loaded empty Mag with all 8 UK SG rounds- did loading/unloading operation of ALL 8. There came an issue of JAM BUT ALL my fault as I again became soft hearted by not pulling all the way with great force!!! Apologies! re-did with 8 rounds at speed - it was indeed smooth!\n(d) Then I put mix of rounds with loading into Mag in following manner:\n 1st Slug, 2nd LG/SG, 3rd Slug, 4th SG, 5th Slug, 6th LG/SG, 7th Slug, 8th SG.\n8th is the top most round that will first go into chamber\n\nSlug = Turkish slug\nLG/SG = Shaheen LG/SG\nSG = UK SG\n\nAll of them in this mixed form were loaded and ejected without any issue at all.\n\n4.

Yesterday I met up with Umair bhai and he opened up my 54, turned out it was already repaired at the point where the rod goes into the piston.\r\n\r\n3 holes had been drilled in the indents in the piston where the rod is fixed, and screws were hammered into the holes to hold the rod. maybe because of mis-handling on my part, one of the screws had loosened and caused the rod to jump out. thankfully the screw stayed inside the hole otherwise the cylinder would have been ''screwed''.\r\n\r\nthis was a major failure and I was looking at the prospect of ordering a new piston from USA and waiting for a month or so for it to arrive.\r\n\r\njust so happened that Umair bhai had a friend''s diana 54 piston with him, as he had replace it with a vortek kit. he put the almost new piston in my gun and viola............. I was in business just 2 hours after meeting a complete stranger. I got a new piston, lube/tune, and trigger setting, all from a few calls using this forum.\r\n\r\nMy only regret is that the seller should have informed that the gun had been thru a major failure and repaired. the repair work was really really bad. small marks all over the piston head, piston seal was  ''cooked'' because of improper lubing, breech seal needs replacing, and there was a small mark outside the cylinder which had caused a small raised portion inside the cylinder. Umair bhai polished it and says it will not cause any performance issue, but it speaks volumes about how the gun was mis-handled during repair work.\r\n\r\nBut alhamdulillah, alls well that ends well. I am deeply indebted to Umair, don''t have words to thank him. now i will have to learn to shoot it......................\r\n\r\nFinally some pics.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThis is my hobby. Keep shooting for at least 100 pellets and then give me the feedback. The trigger of your gun has been adjusted just as its a match trigger with very predictable and crisp break of 2nd stage and the 2nd stage breaks very light to keep on the target.\r\nI just advise not to give this keeper gun to anyone for use. Also arrange spare spring, breech seal and piston seal as replacement parts so that if any such part goes south ever, you will have replacement part at hand.\r\nNever apply any oil or grease. Never fire without pellet.\r\nI am quite sure that the area of the chamber which I polished will not create any problem but if it created any problem, we can get it honed and the chamber will become just like its new.\r\nIt was a very nice meeting you Faraz Bhai.\r\nIt was just your luck that the replacement part was already with me and hence your gun came back to life in just a couple of hours. It''s been properly lube tuned, sled adjusted and trigger adjusted and the cocking rod adjusted.\r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy and love this gun.\r\n\r\nHappy shooting.', ''),

A few weeks ago an elderly farmer asked me to come over and sort his rabbit problem..It seems his wife  has been complaining about rabbit damage around their garden as most of her bedding plants have been eaten this year.\n\nLast night I made my third visit, and after the usual cup of tea and chat, and giving the farmer a hand with a few chores (no visitor gets away without doing some chores!  :grin:)) I took a walk with the CZ around the farm buildings and in the small fields immediately next to them..\n\nAlthough I''ve shot about 20 odd on two previous visits, there was still a fair few about. \n\nRather than stick to one spot, I tend to take a rabbit or two from one area, then switch to the other side of the farm buildings and do the same. By doing this, by the time I get back to my starting point, the rabbits are usually back out..\n\nI stayed a little bit after dark and tried out a new lamp; one of the new high lumen LED tactical torches. This has a green LED and the advertising states it has a 300m beam that is allows shooting out to 200m to 250m. \n\nIn reality, I found out to 40m, it was about perfect, but between 40m and 75m, I found it "questionable" on rabbits at least. Beyond 100m, I don''t think it would be useable at all on anything as small as a rabbit. \n\nAs I want this for shooting rabbits with .22LR subsonics, its touch and go whether I will keep it. \n\nI like the green LED as it seems to work well and the mount to attach it to the scope is well thought out and fully adjustable...The main plus point for me is that the stock mounted switch is a proper "click on/click off" type, not a momentary switch which requires constant pressure to keep it on, which what you usually get on these type of torches over here.\n\nBelow is a few of last nights haul. I lost a couple in the darkness and the farmer kept a couple more back to bait his fox traps..All in all an enjoyable walk around...\n\n[IMG]http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l237/PeteUK24/22lrrabbitting_zps3a3d926d.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(542925, ' [QUOTE=380ACP;380871]Pete on a lighter side, please wish to be born 200 years ago as just 100 years ago Sahibs were destroying the wildlife of a slave country, haha just kidding dont take it on heart, I hope you understand the sahib which was used fof english people in that time.[/QUOTE]\n\nHi 380auto,\n\nI understand what you are saying and no offense taken.\n\nBut I would say that when hunting was regulated by the sahibs, was  there not always plenty of game? Of course, the hunting was largely restricted to the sahibs and the upper class/wealth locals, and I agree that was not fair.\n\nHowever, if you knew what it was like in the UK at the time, the system was exactly the same. \n\nHunting and shooting were largely confined to the weathly and was not really available to working people like myself.\n\nI would venture that most of the wildlife in India and Pakistan that has became very scarce has done so in recent years, long after the British left, and that is because there was too much uncontrolled hunting and poaching.\n\nSo what is a fair system? \n\nPerhaps it is like the Americans have where game populations are conserved and monitored, and then each local State makes available a number of "tags"  at reasonable cost to hunt the surplus. \n\nFor a hunter to be able to hunt, he must pay a small fee and go in a "drawing" for a tag. If he is lucky, his name will be drawn and he can hunt for a deer or a bear or what have you. \n\nIf you wish to hunt a common game animal such as deer, these tags are often available to be bought at local sporting good stores, but the hunter is severely restricted how many he can buy so that lots of people get a chance to hunt.\n\nThe money from the tags goes back towards conserving the game animals and their habitat..\n\nTo me this seems a very fair system was it matters not whether you are rich or poor, or whether you are black or white, everybody has the same chance to hunt, but game populations are kept healthy..\n\nI hope this post does not offend, as it is not meant to, and I hope the moderators see this as a discussion on "game conservation" not politics..:):)\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter', ''),

(542939, ' Denovo87,\n\nI am not a huge fan of eating rabbits. I have tried to cook them several times and they never came out tasting very nice. I have had roast rabbit cooked by somebody else though and it was excellent! I truly don''t know why mine tasted so terrible! If I cook venison from deer, or other game, it usually comes out very good, bu I just have no luck cooking rabbits!\n\nThe rifle I have already mentioned. As from the picture it is a bolt action and it is in rimfire in  .22LR caliber..I assume you guys are familiar with .22LR? We are allowed to have semi-auto .22LR, but I just happen to prefer bolt actions.\n\nThe ammo is Winchester Super X and it is a common .22LR ammo for small game hunting over here. It is "subsonic" meaning its velocity is just below 1000 foot per second, so you don''t get the noisy "crack" when its fired.\n\nThe scope is a 4-14 x44mm with an illuminated reticule. Its a medium priced scope so is not super high quality, but it is more than ok for what I need.  You don''t really need a scope like this on a rimfire, but I picked it because it has similar features to the scope on my .308win so it makes good practice..\n\nThe sticks are extending and I use them them to steady the rifle when taking standing or sitting shots. We use them over here when we hunt deer, so again it is good practice to use them when shooting rabbits. If I can hit a rabbit at 80m, hitting a deer at 150m then becomes quite easy..', ''),

(542958, 'The Sowing Season and the breach This is the season of sowing the paddy crop. This season comes in the  time when the people of this agrarian society mostly are out of their  savings. They exhaust their savings they earn from the previous / last  year’s paddy crop up to this time and mostly they subsist on either  loans the take from their landlords or the merchants they know usually  from decades and in some cases, from generations. The traders /  merchants also know the tradition and lend them food articles, clothes  and even money in case of emergency as they get it back with interest,  when these poor farmers market the fresh crop of paddy in the end of  this year or in the start of New Year. The farmers used to transplant  their crop nearly 60 days earlier in good days (nearly 15 years ago) but  the acute and intensifying shortage of agricultural water has compelled  them to change their sowing timings. This radical change in sowing  schedule had profound effects on choices of the breeds of the seeds they  use to sow. The local / traditional, and low yield breeds of Rice,  which still remain un-surpassed in fragrance and taste could not compete  the genetically engineered hybrid breeds of rice and nearly have gone  extinct. My late grandfather often mentioned    local breeds of rice  called “ Kangro” and “Sugdasi” which are  nowhere to be seen now.   “Sugdasi” rice were phenomenal with regard to their taste and fragrance.  Many of the old timers tell that if only one house had ever cooked  “Sugdasi” Rice in their home, the fragrance was enough to tell entire  village that they are going to have Sugdasi in their meal today. The  qualities of proverbial/ legendry taste and fragrance were not enough to  keeps “Sugdasi” in the list of alive, vibrant and thriving breeds  in  the teeth of cruel competition of survival . Their slow growth and low  per acre yield average was over come by new and genetically engineered  breeds which possess the capability of rapid growth and high yield to  feed the increasing number mouths of growing population and their  fragrance lost the attraction of farmers before smell of fresh currency  notes. Resultantly they are now found only in the memories of old and  infirm people and the pages of history.   Sugdasi rice were succeeded by  famous “Basmati” rice , but those who ate “ Sugdasi” do not consider  “Basmati” to even near to them in any aspect\nThe new Hybrid breeds of rice need less time in getting ready to be  harvested, they also yield more and thus bring more money home but they  can not be used as seeds because they are genetically encoded not to  germinate again. In this way, farmers have to look at the seed supplying  agencies for growing new crop. By this way, the farmers are gradually  loosing their autonomy on their livelihood. It is a very dangerous  situation because there is no proper mechanism to ensure proper  procurement and provision of the seeds to farmers if something should go  wrong. I am one of very few  landlords who make a less beneficial  decision to allocate a considerable area to be sown by non-hybrid seeds  just to retain some of the traditional breeds and my ability to seed my  lands at my own will. But some times, the increasing pressure from the  tenants, owning to their needs and increasing inflation, tumbles my  stance for few moments too. Shall my son continue my legacy of  preservation of local breeds after my eyes are closed?. Who knows?.\nIn this season, the non perennial canals flow to provide water to the  fields. This is termed as the ideal season to take long due “Revenge”  also. The flowing canals solve the problem of disposing off the dead  body of slain enemy. The water also hastens the decomposition process  and identification marks are quickly lost with the additional help of  scavengers living in wet and dry atmosphere. Many featureless bodies  found their eternal abodes under the status of un-identified bodies  where no body comes to say prayers or shed tears ever. But some times to  kill is not the only way to vent the enmity. Some more cunning persons  choose the method of drying up the sources of earning of their opponents  and cause breaches of canals to let the water flow in the fields, farms  and houses of their adversaries to cause them damage they can’t recover  at least till the next crop. Such a mischief is usually followed by an  armed assault on financially broken enemy after few months on a suitable  time. Since my present assignment also include the rescue and relief  work, thus , few days back I was phoned by the locals of my jurisdiction  informing me about a breach in canal which they alleged to be caused by  their opponents. They also complained about the non-responsive attitude  from local irrigation authorities when they were requested to fill up  the breach to avert further loss. \nI immediately talked to higher irrigation authorities to reduce the  discharge to drop the water level and then contacted local the  irrigation authorities and they were reluctant to go to area being  volatile and residents having a history of assaulting the authorities,  yet I managed to get a contingent of Police to escort them to the scene  but they only dared to venture only when I accompanied them to the site   \n\n\nThe team of Irrigation used the traditional and time tested method to  fill up the breach. They advanced in the breach while making up a  structure of wood/ bamboos with ropes. This structure was subsequently  supported by sand / earth bags and in last the tractors were used to  fill-up the embankments.  \n\nThe width of breach\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img829/6565/0kpn.jpg[/IMG]\n \nThe evacuation \n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img7/7589/l5xm.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe damage to the transplanted crop\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img10/2893/fyu5.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe work in progress\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img534/972/h9tx.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img547/9678/1gyh.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img11/7373/z1yr.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img11/7373/z1yr.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nI was fasting during this exercise and temperature was above 45 degree centigrade .', ''),

Good for me because I am a really bad shooter.\n\nWeapon isheavy ( empty about 40 oz) but it feels really good in hand and grip is amazing, personally I was very comfortable with it.\n\nRecoil was not that much perhaps due to heavy weapon itself or I expected too much from .45\n\nIt is a pure HD weapon and a really good one & I thank God that I made the right decision of Sarsilmaz over Taurus 1911 (money by the grace of God was not an issue but there was a difference of 28K between two ) I have handled both but the feel of Sarsilmaz is amazing.\n\nIt is all steel both body and frame but is not in 1911 design. Resembles very much to CZ75 with a slide moving inside the frame perhaps contributing to the good accuracy of the gun.\nAgin it is not for concealed carry/Daily carry . \nNow I took no pictures of the target because 6'''' grouping at 20 yards is something not worth sharing when fellow pakgun members are doing much much better felt really ashamed looking at the target.\n\nThis is my first review of any gun and i believe a very poor one so if you guys have any thing to ask plz feel free I will answer what i know \n\nRegards', ''),

Yesterday I met up with Umair bhai and he opened up my 54, turned out it was already repaired at the point where the rod goes into the piston.\r\n\r\n3 holes had been drilled in the indents in the piston where the rod is fixed, and screws were hammered into the holes to hold the rod. maybe because of mis-handling on my part, one of the screws had loosened and caused the rod to jump out. thankfully the screw stayed inside the hole otherwise the cylinder would have been ''screwed''.\r\n\r\nthis was a major failure and I was looking at the prospect of ordering a new piston from USA and waiting for a month or so for it to arrive.\r\n\r\njust so happened that Umair bhai had a friend''s diana 54 piston with him, as he had replace it with a vortek kit. he put the almost new piston in my gun and viola............. I was in business just 2 hours after meeting a complete stranger. I got a new piston, lube/tune, and trigger setting, all from a few calls using this forum.\r\n\r\nMy only regret is that the seller should have informed that the gun had been thru a major failure and repaired. the repair work was really really bad. small marks all over the piston head, piston seal was  ''cooked'' because of improper lubing, breech seal needs replacing, and there was a small mark outside the cylinder which had caused a small raised portion inside the cylinder. Umair bhai polished it and says it will not cause any performance issue, but it speaks volumes about how the gun was mis-handled during repair work.\r\n\r\nBut alhamdulillah, alls well that ends well. I am deeply indebted to Umair, don''t have words to thank him. now i will have to learn to shoot it......................\r\n\r\nFinally some pics.', ''),

I could clearly see that this type of setup would definately cause some sort of resistance to HP rounds as they are not fully rounded from the tip. any edged bullet would definately get some sort of resistance as the bullet has to ride up the feed ramp and hop over the empty space then into the seperate barrel. if the feed ramp would be integrated it would definately be a one smooth (fluid) motion. but then again, in a rotating lock mechanism u just cant have an integrated feed ramp. so I took the gun apart and placed a HP bullet (courtesy of Dr. Zakir) on the feed ramp (mimicking a round feed) and slowly started pushing it towards the barrel. guess what? I clearly felt resistance as the sharp angle of the HP round would get sorta stuck in the space between the feed ramp and barrel.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]went to a friend of mine who also own a CF98 and same thing happened in his gun as well. I guess that settles the argument that only my CF98 is incompatible with HP rounds.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]now, after all this I thought of stoeger and upon seeing its pictures on internet I believe that a stoeger would also be incompatible with HP rounds as it also has a very similar design and feed ramp is also not integrated into the barrel. its feed ramp is also built into the rotating lock. the images clearly showed same space between the feed ramp and the barrel. I''m assuming that since everything from the design point looks the same I guess it would also pose similar reliability issues with HP. however stoeger owners/users can confirm on that.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]now comming to the main point. what can we do to solve this issue. i''m thinking highly polishing the feed ramp to improve feeding. i''ll get back with results as soon as I get that donw. but i''m also thinking that there is nothing I can do with the two piece feed ramp and barrel design"[/COLOR][/I][/FONT][/SIZE]', ''),

Looking for the small survival knife, the type British SAS use or button press out, and button press in knife) and .22LR CCI rounds, if they are around 25rs each otherwise Lahore CCI order would do.\n\nAs for the P22Q original laser, Buksh Elahi in Lahore are selling genuine for 18K so 30K seems a very high price in Peshawar. and yes, the 1.5k to 2.5k chinese rail fitment ones are not worth. In USA, the delivered price of a genuine P22Q laser is $120 (with Walther logo on it etc), but it looks like a chinese packaged laser, as Walther has outsourced the genuine laser manufacturing to China.\n\nAny idea when the arms shop in Peshawar will re-open? Gul Arms units open on Tuesday/Wednesday, I am not sure how many days the dealers there are closing for.\n\nThanks brother.[/QUOTE]\n\nBrother you''re always welcome i think the shops will be open till now.\nREGARDS', ''),

So if a Tiger kills in one village, by studying its movements and making notes where else it has killed, Corbett and others would know roughly when it was due to return and would wait in ambush.\n\n  Men such as Corbet could identify individual tigers from their foot prints, and if it had been seen, it may also have certain recognisable features. One I recall reading that one was missing an ear which has been shot off by an errant hunter.while another had a crooked or stumpy tail which had been damaged in a fight.\n\nAlso ordinary tigers, tended to be less bold. So when Corbett or others came across a tiger that appeared to be very brave or determined to attack them, it was likely to be the maneater. \n\nCorbett and others often found that Maneaters would not take baits such as cows which had been tied out and down often walk right by the baits prefering to look for a human. \n\nSo all these things, and many more, were clues that allowed Corbett to work out which tiger he should be after..\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter', ''),

(544025, ' If a rifled barrel is available from the manufacturer or aftermarket, it might be simpler and cheaper in the end to just go through the import hassle and buy one.\n\n If the shotgun has a screw-in choke, there may be a rifled choke available for it.  Back in the 1800s, this configuration was called a "Paradox gun."  The Wikipedia entry says it was invented by Holland & Holland for dangerous game riles, though I believe it predates that be a couple of decades.\n\n Also, note that ordinary smoothbore shotgun barrels can often give useful accuracy when shooting slugs.  There are many configurations of slugs, most of them of the "chunk of lead going down the barrel" type; others with elaborate plastic cups to center the slug and keep it straight while it goes down the barrel.\n\n Various vendors sell brass 12ga shells, but if there are no legal restrictions for you, you can use fireformed .50 BMG brass.  Many shotguns have enough extractor travel to grab the BMG case and pull it out of the chamber.  Some people turn the head of the BMG case down and glue or solder a brass shotgun shell rim on.\n\n The BMG brass is long enough you can use a proper bullet, depending on your chamber and barrel diameter.  For a century or so there were no real standards for shotgun shells and chambers.  Now there are standards, but nobody pays much attention to them, and nobody cares, as long as all shells will fit and fire in all shotguns.  But sometimes that winds up being a very sloppy fit. \n\n Shotgun shells get longer after they''re fired, so the breech is long enough for the fired shells to eject properly.  If you''re loading cast bullets into brass cases, you have to be careful not go get the overall length of the cartridge (once it''s a brass case with a bullet, it''s a "cartridge" to me...) get so long that it won''t feed up from the magazine.

(544153, 'My First Handgun - How, When, Where; My First Handgun - How, When, Where; [SIZE=4][FONT=Helvetica Neue Light][FONT=microsoft sans serif]I am not entirely new to handguns but am not veteran either. I mean, it was my friend’s old rusted Walther 9mm that I shot for the first time in 1996. Thereafter, came across few opportunities like catching up with friends for some gun time get togethers. Firing any handgun (readied by someone else of course) used to be like a big deal back then, something to brag about in school/college. All handguns felt the same, fired the same, heck, even looked the same. It was in 2003, when I was encouraged by an elder to keep a handgun for SD keeping in view, our traveling to the village and etc. Didn’t quite pay any heed to the advice to be honest. Many friends and family members would brandish their TTs, 12 bore rifles and AKs endorsing their manhood but I never quite got past the point of keeping a handgun or for that matter anything else that fires a bullet. In other words, guns never impressed me. I was more into computers, gadgets and stuff. Yeah people did call me a freaky, burger-type geek. Back in those days, there weren’t shiny iPhones, iPads and other iStuff to show off and grab attention with.[/FONT][/FONT][FONT=Helvetica Neue Light][FONT=microsoft sans serif]As I correctly recall, on a cool and beautiful overcast day in 2006, having some tea in the lawn when my gun crazy cousin showed up at my doorstep and asked me to accompany him. Well, not having a girlfriend or even a car to take her out on a long drive, going out with this nut was my best bet. We drove to his favourite dealer, Mazhar Alam at Fakhr-e-Alam Arms in Peshawar. An entirely unimpressive cramped shop in the city. I was being tested for my patience at the store as people from all walks of life would come in and go. The terminologies spoken seemed like greek to me. Somehow, I sensed slightly higher degree of respect exhibited by Mazhar Alam towards my cousin. “Oh well, probably they are good buddies” is what I thought. We had two cups of Qahva (Green Tea) before my friend’s handgun was put in front of us. A black plastic box with a handle and a weird logo I couldn’t make out initially. The box was snapped open and that was the time that I experienced love at first sight. It was a Glock 19. Even despite the fact that I was not even aware of what a Glock was, that gun caught my attention amidst numerous shiny and fancy-to-weird-looking pieces including Taurus and Beretta that were being checked out by other customers.[/FONT][/FONT][FONT=Helvetica Neue Light][FONT=microsoft sans serif]We hopped into his car and I immediately grabbed the box from him and started examining the Glock as if a caveman would do with a Zippo lighter. My cousin jokingly warned me “Careful, thats not for kids AND NERDS to play with”. I don’t even remember lifting my head for the rest of our drive back home. The price my cousin revealed was, well, something I thought he was insanely exaggerating. He literally begged me not to tell the price of the handgun to his wife or family. Well, that was something I was good at, “keeping secrets”. Few days into the purchase, at home, my computers started catching up dust, the keyboard started getting banged by my kids all over the house and the mouse became a fun toy at my neighbor''s kids room. I started to “turn”, bitten by a vampire named [FONT=tahoma][I][B]Glock-ula[/B][/I][/FONT]. And trust me, I was not in love the Glock due to its reputation or brand name. Hell, I had never even heard of it before. Its simplicity, straight lines and different design started to pound my head for many hours during the day before I couldn’t take it any more. So I decided to go and get a Glock and get over with it. Little did I understand that I’ll wind up getting a gun rather than getting a Glock (budget woes). Well, it was fine to scratch that itch so long as it was a gun. But my hopes were shattered when the CF-98 was opened up in front of me NIB for a whopping Rupees 24,000/-. Damn, whats all that grease, slush and oil? Mazhar Alam, with his one eye brow raised gave me that look and asked his helper to get it cleaned up and ready. I could even hear him swearing at me in his heart. After many minutes of wait and only one Qahva (no complaint, I was a CF-98 customer and its natural), the CF-98 was brought in cleaned and I quickly got over the dejection of not being able to afford a Glock. And before any customer walked in asking for a Glock, I thought it was best to get the hell outa there. But I was happy, after all, this was my very own gun, Norinco CF-98. It stayed with me for a year before that itch came up again and I traded it in for a Stoeger Cougar. And so the itch continues till this very day. By the Grace of Almighty Allah, I have a Glock 17 Gen 4 now. I consider it another blessing from Allah during this month of Ramazan.\n[FONT=tahoma][B][I]I strongly believe Allah grants you what you honestly wish for from the depth of your heart, its just a matter of time.[/I][/B][/FONT] [/FONT][/FONT][/SIZE]', 'My First Handgun - How, When, Where'),

(544474, ' To WD-40 or not to WD-40?  That is the  question.  It seems that as long as there have been firearms, the debate  on proper maintenance techniques has raged on.  Staunch believers on  both sides of the fence have strong opinions about which products are  the best to protect their investment and keep their guns in perfect  working condition.\n\n[URL="http://wd40.com/news/in-the-news/Brands/wd40.cfm"]WD-40[/URL]  has been used in the gun industry for many years.  It is not only safe  to use on your gun, but comes highly recommended by many experts in the  industry due to its cleaning, rust preventing, moisture displacing,  penetrating and lubricating properties.\n\nJoe Singleton, owner of Singleton’s Gun Shop in Dix, Neb., is a 20-year  veteran of the industry.  Singleton has been recommending WD-40 for as long as he can remember.  "I use WD-40  as a cleaner.  Its penetrating qualities help break down powder  residues and clean out the build-up that inevitably forms in a firearm  after use.  This build-up could lead to jamming or misfiring, so I use  the multi-purpose product to remove all traces."\n\nOther professionals swear by the product for use in firearms  restoration, cleaning and preventive maintenance.  Brodie Gratiot,  manager of Sievert’s Enterprises Ltd., in Pueblo, Co., the largest  stocking gun dealer in the eight Rocky Mountain states, finds many uses  for the product in restoring guns that come into his gun shop.\n\n"When faced with a rusted gun, we spray it down with WD-40,  let it sit for 24 hours, spray it again, and wipe off the rust  deposits," said Gratiot.  "This also works with deep pitted rust, we use  a toothbrush and WD-40 to remove the deep-set rust  deposits from the pitting without marring the finish."  After gun  handling and restoration, all surfaces are wiped with a rag sprayed with  WD-40 to prevent rust caused by skin oil and salt.\n\nDuring late elk and deer season, Gratiot recommends applying a light coating of WD-40 to the bolt, firing pin and trigger mechanism to displace moisture and prevent freezing in sub-zero temperatures.\n\nMaster gunsmith Jose Somarriba of Miami, Fla., uses WD-40  both on the equipment in his shop and to maintain firearms.  Somarriba  uses the product after the bluing process and on shop milling and  grinding machines.  After using a bore solvent agent to remove fouling  he applies WD-40 to prevent rust and to lubricate the barrel.\n\nIn addition to the professionals, avid outdoorsmen like Tim Karpf of Killingsworth, Conn., uses WD-40  to protect recreational equipment from the elements: salt water spray,  rain and snow.  Karpf uses the multi-purpose product to protect exposed  metal parts and to protect the bluing.\n\nAs for the weekend sportsman, everyone knows that the proper care and  upkeep of your expensive equipment makes all the difference in its  longevity and performance.  "After using a solvent to clean the barrel, I  always make a final pass with WD-40 to protect and preserve both the interior and exterior of the barrel," declared Karpf.\n\nIf you would like to share your professional tip for using WD-40 for gun maintenance, please write to:\n \n[LIST] The WD-40 Company \n    P.O. Box 80607 \n    San Diego, CA 92138-0607 \n[/LIST]\n     [url]http://wd40.com/news/in-the-news/wd-40andreg-can-be-an-effective-maintenance-tool-for-gun-owners/[/url]', ''),

(544498, ' Its taken me quite some time time going through this thread and researching the internet for all sorts of reviews. I''ve reached a few conclusions which are purely my personal opinions about the Caracal (the company and weapon itself). While these points may not be the turning points for most of you, but I hope it will bear some effect in your decision making. Please bear with me.\n\n1. The gun owning and loving community has rapidly grown after 2001 specially after rise in crimes and disturbance in security situation in the country. But the the hot trend of reading reviews and researching over the internet for hours has sped up after 2005. As a result of which the average customer is now more aware of pros and cons of a product and in most of the cases is knowledgeable enough to decide himself. \n\n2. Customers who own a single piece have multiplied and so have the enthusiasts with reasonably large collections. More Security Companies have evolved and grown in size. By the way, the same has happened to computers in the IT field. The gun making industry which is booming since the beginning of time and will continue to do so is now aggressively battling for market shares. China too, has expanded beyond the good old TT to modern and yet affordable CF series, NP series reaching out to the masses. By the way, I remember CF-98 being sold for 24K in 2008. \n\n3. Now, please try to understand that as a whole gun market of Turkey and China has helped a lot in bringing down prices but particular models with a lesser price tag does not necessarily mean that the product is cheap because of labour and shipment and less bells and whistles and blah blah blah. No sir! The first corner the manufacturer will cut is with the Research & Development. Doing away with this department is almost reducing your overall costs into half. The S/Cougar is a perfect example. Produce a handgun where the labour is cheap, metallurgical process is cheap, own a subsidiary company, no R&D involved. So are the Chinese: Copy Paste and Photoshop.\n\nOkay with all the bulls**t I just posted above giving you a fair recapitulation lets move onto the Caracal in the next post.', ''),

I always used ARMSCOR while I had the CF-98 and Stoeger Cougar. Never gave me a problem. Caracal should have tested the weapon with all sorts of ammo. If it did, then we are to blame for inconsistent standard of ammo.\n\n2. [B][U]Accessories[/U][/B]: Caracal should have jumped into the market with some options of factory night sights, extended magazines and stuff. Or at least contracted few companies to do so simultaneously as the pistol rolled out.\n\n3. [U][B]Finish[/B][/U]: Why would a finish wear off from the gun so easily? Being extremely careful with the cosmetics of the gun is not the intended way. It should sustain holster wear. What is so difficult in that considering the technology behind the gun in this modern era. \n\nThe few instances of the pistol failures shown above happen to every manufacturer. It happened to Caracal. So whats the big deal? Well, again, we tend to expect very high of whatever we have not realizing the lack of proper maintenance and sub standard ammo we feed it.

(544570, ' [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nAs a former user/owner of MP446 and a current user/owern of CZ-999 Scorpion (ancestor of EZ-9) Kindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject:\r\n\r\n[B]Baikal MP446 Viking:[/B]\r\n\r\nFrom metallurgy standpoint, I do not see a reason not to call it a tank. everything about this handgun just oozes ruggedness/robustness. someone once mentioned the shape of the guide rod. I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. Baikal''s slim guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\r\n\r\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\r\n\r\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary. infact, if you compare wall thicknesses of various 9mm handguns, you''ll find Baikal MP446s barrel to be quiet thin compared to others.\r\n\r\n[B]CZ 999 Scorpion:[/B]\r\n\r\na time proven design that has faced the most "hard to impress" consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\r\n\r\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\r\n\r\nThe hammer forged barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chrome-lined from inside and outside whereas Baikal''s barrel is chromed lined from inside only.\r\n\r\nThe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deeper and more profound compared to Viking. I do not know what it means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to handguns, barrel isn''t everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel insert. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. not the strongest of setup as Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\r\n\r\nNow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class but it ends here. there are other controls too. CZ-999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are a major turn-off.\r\n\r\n[B]Bottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):[/B]\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort matters a lot. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when we go to a store to buy a pair of boots, we buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t we all go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip out feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different.? \r\n\r\nAny tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\r\n\r\nHowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day of the week (no credible evidence, just popular view). however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers a lot more than just durability so do look into it.\r\n\r\nin my humble and personal opinion you can do a lot more with CZ 999 than what you can do with Baikal from customization/accessory/repair standpoint.\r\n\r\nyou can make your own guide rods, similarly you can replace all major springs with commonly available spring in the market (slight modification may be necessary). you can also get quality Kydex holsters that fit a CZ 999 whereas with a baikal you are limited to cheap nylon holsters. did I mention that you can easily convert inexpensive beretta/sig magazines to CZ 999 Scorpion compatible magazines?\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(544596, '22LR - Bullet Spin Rate Barrel rifling revolutionized the manufacture of the gun. A bullet fired from such a barrel forces the projectile a twist motion, similar to that of a gyroscope.  This motion stabilizes the bullet, which in turn leads to better accuracy.\n \nGun enthusiasts often talk about velocities of ammunition. Hardly anyone discusses bullet spin rate. This is primarily due to lack of knowledge how bullet spin rate is computed.  Two factors determine the rate - bullet velocity and the rifling twist ratio. The twist ratio is a factor derived from the number of inches a bullet travels in barrel to complete one revolution. Modern day 22LR rifle manufacturers have adapted the 1:16 ratio. That is to say, a bullet will travel 16 inches in the barrel in order to complete one revolution. In the 22LR arena, twist ratios of 1:9, 1:12 and 1:14 are rare but not unheard of.  Faster twist rate are necessary to stabilize heavier bullets.\n \nAguila 22LR 30-grain Super Magnum has muzzle velocity of 1,750 feet per second. Due to manufacturing methods, manufacturing tolerances and the length of the barrels, we may or may not attain this velocity. For this discussion we will assume that the rated velocity is attained at the muzzle. A velocity of 1,750 feet per second equates to [1,750X12] 21,000 inches per second. At this distance the bullet makes [21,000/16] 1,312.5 revolutions in one second. In one minute the bullet completes [1,312.5X60]78,750 rpm or revolutions per minute. \n \nBear in mind that the spin rate will change as the bullet travels down range with ever decreasing velocity. In dry air [temp 20C] the speed of sound is 1,125 feet per second or [1,125*12] or 13,5000 inches per second . At a distance of 120 yards the Aguila bullet still retain the speed of sound. At this distance the bullet makes [13,500/16] 843.75 revolutions in one second or [843.75*60] 50,625 rpm or revolutions per minute.\n \nStill father downrange, at a distance of 135 yards Aguila&#8217;s bullet velocity is reduced to 1,080 feet per second or [1,080*12] 12,960 inches per second - the same velocity that a standard velocity 22LR cartridge delivers at the muzzle. At this distance the bullet makes [12,960/16]810 revolutions in one second. In one minute the bullet completes [810*60] 48,600 rpm or revolutions per minute.\n   \n \nRelated Post: \n#15 You & Your Friend Have Two Different Rifles', ''),

(544607, ' I had a chance to compare both weapons again the other day. The Baikal belonged to a friend and the EZ9 was mine. Granted the Baikal was a bit older, and hence more used, but the difference in fit and finish is SIGNIFICANT. The Baikal just seems like an inferior product - in terms of appearances and finishing. The blocky design of the Viking does have its appeal though, and the polymer does make it lighter, but as Denovo mentioned the EZ9 is much much more comfortable in my view. The Baikal has an immensely over-built barrel, but I assure you that the EZ9 is no wimp in this regard. There are reports of a CZ999 (essentially the same gun) to have had close to 100,000 rounds through it, with no deterioration in quality and accuracy. Not sure how accurate this is, but this has been cited several times on several different forums. The sights on the EZ9 are also much better, the action is smoother, and the grip more ergonomic. \n\nBut, at the end of the buy what suits you and what appeals to you.

Since he has already bought the CF-98 and is satisfied (I assume no malfunctions, good ergonomics), just because the other handgun is a slightly updated model (please note that I said updated not necessarily better), there no need to hop up. In fact he can save the amount he''ll be flushing down for "trade-in" for ammo and stuff. That way he can enjoy the heck out of it and still be able to sell at a reasonable price later.\n\nI strongly suggest buyers to do their research first, search the Pak Guns site forums for what they are looking for, ask questions here and when satisfied should go and purchase a weapon. But once purchased, I''d request the buyer not to look back unless he meets persistent malfunction(s) / issues AND other members not to comment like "You should have bought that, That one is better than this one and blah blah". Guys please don''t hate me for this, I know, its a public forum open to views (of course within the guidelines of the site) but trust me a lot of us go back, trade-in a recently purchased weapon with the one that''s touted about and in the process lose quite some $$$$$ (please note the number of $). This helps in encouraging and bringing satisfaction to the owner.\n\nBut if the trade-in amount is in the budget of the buyer and he feels that he has been corrected by fellow members, he should get it done.', ''),

If the tow trolley is to remain standing for days in field or in garage, then I would suggest adding two jacks say 1-ton each which are very cheap so that you can lift up the trolley say an inch above ground to save tyres. Tyres will get weak quickly if they remain idle.\n2. Any thoughts to all removable canopy of inexpensive cloth?\n3. Will you paint to protect against rust? I will suggest if no plans.\n4.  I strongly suggest to put brake lights in syn with you Jeep''s brake light, this will be great for your and others safety.\n5. Using tubeless tyres (may be old but not too old) can be good options as they to do not get deflated if punctured.\n6. Put illumination for safety at night that can be hid once in field.\n7. Welds at axle end with wheels must be properly welded. We call it to have it STRUCTURAL WELD not ordinary spot type weld that I see right now in your picture.\n8. A bit of very strong advice!! PLEASE travel very, very slow when towing this trolley at the back of your vehicle. WHY? because it is custom built using least engineering design calculations therefore reliability would be questioned (at least by me :)). It may topple on higher speed, it might loose axle joint under dynamic loading, it may get loose from the connection where it is towed with your jeep, it might slip on turns, it might go out of main direction in transverse direction on bend of roads, it might jump on bumps. Dear bro with no offence at all, these issues that I am hi-lighting only for yours and others safety and NOT for just one or few trips but say over next 10 years or more!

But we can''t make excuses for that because tell me how many of us travel over 300 KM for one tour in one year. We cannot get into double figures so we have to give some tolerence because this problem can be minimized if not get fully solved. In long drives we can take pauses after every 60km for cup of tea or water. By doing this we can get familiar with new areas and people little more by spending some time. This is the beauty of outdoors that make us get into different variety of atmospheres and situations. So by doing this we can make this deficiency into efficiency by only spending couple of extra hours.\r\n\r\nSecond thing is that on long trips we mostly travel in 3-6 people groups.

If the tow trolley is to remain standing for days in field or in garage, then I would suggest adding two jacks say 1-ton each which are very cheap so that you can lift up the trolley say an inch above ground to save tyres. Tyres will get weak quickly if they remain idle.\r\n2. Any thoughts to all removable canopy of inexpensive cloth?\r\n3. Will you paint to protect against rust? I will suggest if no plans.\r\n4.  I strongly suggest to put brake lights in syn with you Jeep''s brake light, this will be great for your and others safety.\r\n5. Using tubeless tyres (may be old but not too old) can be good options as they to do not get deflated if punctured.\r\n6. Put illumination for safety at night that can be hid once in field.\r\n7. Welds at axle end with wheels must be properly welded. We call it to have it STRUCTURAL WELD not ordinary spot type weld that I see right now in your picture.\r\n8. A bit of very strong advice!! PLEASE travel very, very slow when towing this trolley at the back of your vehicle. WHY? because it is custom built using least engineering design calculations therefore reliability would be questioned (at least by me :)). It may topple on higher speed, it might loose axle joint under dynamic loading, it may get loose from the connection where it is towed with your jeep, it might slip on turns, it might go out of main direction in transverse direction on bend of roads, it might jump on bumps. Dear bro with no offence at all, these issues that I am hi-lighting only for yours and others safety and NOT for just one or few trips but say over next 10 years or more! Forgive me for being too critical, I hope you will not mind!\r\n9. Can you post connection details between jeep and this trolley. Please also send some more pics of ther joints such as axle to wheel, body to axle and springs etc.\r\nHappy hunting and safe hunting!\r\nRegards[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nDear Dr Sb.\r\n\r\nThanks for suggestions\r\n\r\ni will follow all suggestions mentioned above, which are realy helpful....tomorrow i will share more picture clear one...\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nKeep in touch..\r\n\r\nOmer', ''),

(545082, ' [COLOR=#3e3e3e]If Stoeger Cougar was named Beretta Cougar (as it was originally), then it would be costing 3 or 4 times the price of Taurus PT92/99 in PK and usual chimes will be ''It is a Beretta afterall with a longer heritage and quality than Taurus anyday so Beretta Cougar would be the weapon of choice'' (for example, let''s compare PX4 to PT92!) .... If one is going to compare PT92/99, then compare it with Beretta 92FS that it is a clone of and make the bold statement that it is a better gun than Beretta M9 (military version) or 92FS for that matter. Stoeger is a wholly owned subsidiary of Beretta with Cougar manufacturing unit itself moved from Italy to Turkey whereas Beretta sold the rights, the blueprint and manufacturing equipment of it''s 92FS to Taurus hence PT92/99 were born. Stoeger''s magazines are still manufactured in Italy .... Steoger IS Beretta, and I doubt that Beretta would cut more corners than they do in their parent label guns so metallurgy of SC should be as good as any Beretta out there. Stoeger had blueing finishing issues but 2013 model is brushed blueing and looks very nice indeed so where manual labour is concerned, Turkish employees are improving. [/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#3E3E3E]I owned PT99, didn''t like it due to adjustable sites so swapped it for PT92. Before owing PT99, my very first purchase was SC, and I absolutely love this pistol (I have 2 now, thanks to a friend). Yes, SC has more recoil than PT92/99 but I prefer it over both 99/92. It is my daily CC too, and with a belt holster from Shams Saddlers, I have no issues driving with it on and walked in to many places wearing a t-shirt without guards etc noticing or even stopping for a check so I don''t consider it to be a non-CC for me at least (whereas PT92 is non-CC for me, unless it is tucked in the middle back of the jeans on the inside - [/COLOR][I]odd [/I][I]place for that long frame to be). Yes, SC is on the heavier side compared to any TT for example but it doesn''t take long to get used to CC it.\n\nAs mentioned above about PT92 being a HD (and range) gun, I totally agree hence in the process of replacing it with a 1911 or a .45 as that would be a better HD weapon than a PT92, heck a 30 Cal would be more lethal HD round than a 9mm. As for range, that''s for me to improve on faster draw, faster aim and rapid firing skills for SD purposes only. The PT92 has been in the box since new (test fired a few rounds when purchasing, cleaned and boxed) and I don''t see any reason keeping it anymore especially as I am not into friendly competition range shootings. Yes, it is indeed a very charming and beautiful gun in SS but that charm wears off against practicality when it is locked up.

(545095, ' Assalam o Alaykum\n\nLooks like my thread has been overtaken.  \n\nI don''t know if anyone remembers, but a few months ago I mentioned that I was going to Pakistan and was interested in purchasing a handgun upon getting my 9mm license. \n\nThe license never came and is still going through the process.  My family are originally from Kashmir and so upon a visit there I met with a relative who has a gun shop.  \n\nWhen discussing the issue with him he informed me that it was possible to get me a license in Kashmir for a 9mm. \n\nI paid him 3500 PKR and within about a week and a half I had my license.\n\nI then started looking for a gun I really wanted the CZ P07 Duty in OD Green from Lahore (that was offered here on [url]www.pakguns.com[/url]) but due to time constraints and not having the legal paperwork as I was only on a visit for exactly 1 month this was no longer an option.\n\nSo off I went to visit another dealer through a friend to find a potential gun.  \n\nHe showed me a gun that I had never paid attention to and informed me that if I really had my heart on the CZ then he could not do anything to change my mind.  But, if I was willing to try something else, then maybe he could help!  \n\nSo out came a [B]2012 Baikal MP-446[/B] [B]9mm with two original magazines [/B]that come in the box.  Being new to handguns I noticed that the serial number of the guns was visible on the slide of and on the underside of the gun below the trigger and on each of the two magazine.\n\nWe took it out to a desolate piece of land and the dealer asked me how many bullets I wanted to test through the gun.  \n\nMy friend made it clear to the dealer (his friend) that if we had any problems with the gun over the next year we would being it back to him.  He assured us that if we took care of the gun and maintained it properly, if the gun didn''t function correctly.  He would replace it with another gun (can''t get better than that)\n\nI didn''t have a clue about how many bullets to use as I had never fired anything other than double barrel shotgun.  So I said 10.\n\nHe loaded the bullets in the magazine.  The spring of the magazine was very tough as it had not been fired previously.  \n\nI wanted an CZ and he was convincing me that due to the time that I had left being limited he would not be able to get me the gun of my dreams.\n\nSo here we go.  In to the valley.  We load upon the magazine.  It has a manual safety which can be switched to either side and is has a magazine release which can be switched to either side.  \n\nThe magazines both of them hold 18 bullet in a double stack formation and a raised  raised red loaded chamber indicator.\n\nI let off the first bullet was very surprised at the almost non-existent recoil.  I let off the other 8 bullets slowly and was very suprised at the feel of the gun.\n\nI bought the gun, it cost me 80,000 PKR.  Some may say a little pricey but I really think it is worth it.  Had I been in Pashawar or Lahore or even Karachi I may have paid less.\n\nI will post some photos soon in shaa Allaah.\n\nI the 1 week that I had the gun.  I put no less than 500 bullets through it with not one single misfire.\n\nWhat I did first before taking the gun home was to understand how it was to be cleaned (thoroughly).  And I guess in my very, very limited knowledge this has a lot to do with the gun performing so well.\n\nI only wish my stay had been longer and I could have spent time with my second love (my wife being the first, of course).\n\nBut I look forward to us meeting up again very soon.\n\nP.S.  What did I learn:  "Guns are not a toy so always treat it as if it is loaded and do no point it at anything that you are not prepared to kill!!"\n\nP.P.S. How am I doing with the fun terminology.

(545278, 'Problem with HATSAN ESCORT BARRELS  ( Cracked Barrels ) . Plz read &amp; comment AOA.\n\nFew days back I was just checking out my Hatsan Escort MPA Semiauto and I was shocked to see about 2-3 mm wide crack /groove encircling about 30-40% of diameter of barrel. The portion of barrel which has an attached ring for assembly with rest of the gun.\n\nEven with my very limited knowledge about firearms it was impossible for me to digest that barrel of shotgun has an ill defined crack. I contacted the dealer and he showed me many other semiautos of Hatsan and everyone of them has this fault more or less.\n\nEven the dealer admitted that barrels are faulty & it was due to strongly attached external metalic ring to the barrel. And they have reported this issue but Hatsan do not care as long as their shotguns are on good sale.\n\nNow gentlemen lets see from this angle, if something external attached to outside of the barrel is causing such a crack on the inside!!!\nwhat does that mean BARREL IS VERY WEAK AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT. plain and simple.\n\nI never gave a second thought and sold the shotgun at 60% price ( just fired 25 shells and bought about one and a half month back ) & purchased Hatsan Aimguard Pump Action. I thoroughly examined the barrels of at least 3 PA Aimguard and they had crystal clear barrels ( as it should be ).\n\nPlz I request you all gentlemen to check the barrels of Hatsan Semiautos particularly if you own one or if you are planning to get one to make sure you do not have a faulty / cracked barrel.\nIn my humble opinion it is not safe to shot even a birdshot from such shotguns.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts and give your valueable expert opinion\nSeniors are requested to address the issue.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(545330, '22LR - Why This? Do you know what a 22LR is? if yes, do you have one? If so, read some more and your love for same will grow.  If you don’t know what a 22LR is, please join the discussion and get in the grove. I have written more than 50 thousand words on this topic on this web site. \n\nThe 22LR [22 Long Rifle] is a rim-fire brass cartridge designed for use in small arms - pistols, revolvers and rifles.  It was invented well over a century ago - in 1887. The utility of the 22LR has stood the test of time. It is the most popular cartridge on earth. More 22LR cartridges are manufactured than all other combined. Best of all, it is the cheapest brass cartridge on the markets everywhere.  Don’t worry about the recoil of the 22LR - it will not kick you like a mule. It is milder than an air rifle. You will be pleasantly surprised to learn that the recoil is barely noticeable.  It is the ideal cartridge for beginners - men women and young adults. I joined the 22LR hobby over sixty years ago. I am still intrigued by this marvel. In this hobby there are two polite words for everyone, including me - safety first. \n\nIf you are interested in target shooting - this cartridge is for you.  You can shoot all day long and not worry about going broke. The 22LR is very popular cartridge on the range. Go to your local gun range and have a practice session.  Rangemasters are friendly folks. Feel free to ask for pointers and guidance. With practice your scores will improve. Don’t be surprised if one day you find yourself entering and winning in shooting competitions.  \n\nIf you are interested in small game hunting, there is no better way than to start with the 22LR. Games like rabbits are not out of reach for distances of 75 yards or more. Get to know the ballistics of this cartridge and you can get an even longer reach. Bear this in mind - shoot only if you are confident to kill the game humanely. It is your ethical duty to track an injured animal, find it and kill it. One final word - for beginners, experts and others in-between; please share your 22LR experiences by posting here. We will look forward to reading your words.', ''),

I even had a 24/7 Pro Titanium, had upgraded from a Stoeger Cougar, shot just about 50 rounds before I went back and replaced it with a Stoeger Cougar (again).\nIts got all the bells and whistles, amalgamated technological ideas from every manufacturer, got their designs beautiful, but I''m not sure if they have tested their guns with reloaded and cheap ammo. People like me may sell an arm and sacrifice few salaries to purchase a gun but would eventually end up buying cheap ammo. So I''d like my Taurus to be able to chew on everything.

(545395, ' just replied to the article, lets see if it gets posted \n\nThe Mob psyche of following the band wagon can be seen clearly in the article and most of the reader comments (no offenses). Everyone just seems to be hell bent on defaming the guns, i would humbly disagree with the common opinion. Most of us have grown up playing with toy guns as kids playing the same chor police game (at least all my friends, cousins etc etc) none of us ended up as a gun brandishing  terrorist or psycho killer or target killer, but some of them did end up in the armed forces. So i think its all about the perspective with which you look at a thing, i would say it was a good game. The writer has also referred to the NGO which believes that guns are the reason of terrorism in the region, believe me its not true. Its the lack of control by the government and involvement of different foreign intelligence agencies in our dear Country. As far is the naming of this particular gun as "Osama Gun" is concerned, the reason is that this gun was seen in Osama''s hands or with him in various pictures and videos. Weapons have been declared as a jewelry for Muslims, its the west which is polluting our minds against it, all we need is proper grooming of our children and that''s about it. We as a nation don''t want to take responsibility of our children''s grooming, we just want to shift the blame on guns. The USA has the most liberal gun laws of the world, why is there no actual terrorism over there ? Why the Pakistani Armed Forces are under attack and why not the US Forces in America?

In your case you replaced the rear sight''s plate with a peep hole which is not correct.I suggest you to continue using Diana''s original open sights and these sights will give you less than 1" group at 20 yards.You should achieve this much accuracy before moving any further.I appreciate your effort to make peep. But in order to use peep it should be installed on the scope rail and the original Diana rear sight should be removed by unscrewing the two screws which hold the rear sight otherwise this rear sight will come in between the peep sight and front sight.So conceptually your effort is appreciable but is in the wrong direction.Just forget using the peep sight for the time being and practice with open sights.Your gun is well broken in that means that more than 1500 pellets have passed through it and thus it has settled and I don''t think it will settle much more.When you last visited me, neither of us had that much time which was due.I suggest you to come to my place once more so that I myself could use your gun and judge its accuracy with open sights.Also some other things may need some time.

(545585, ' Wow - what a long and informative read ...\n\nFirstly, Allah ka shukar hai ke our brother survived the failure that could have been fatal.\n\nSecond, hats off to all the senior members in stepping in, taking action in fully supporting brothers and ultimately forcing Caracal to cave in.\n\nAs for Caracal, it is something I considered (it was 55K when I first saw it) but decided against it purely because it is a new kid on the block and besides the whatnot certifications, it is not time tested yet like other long established foreign brands (yes, they had problems too but a 188 to 220 = 38 batches x 100 guns per batch = 3,800 guns being faulty is definitely a major QC failure). It is kind of (well not really but just as an example) like buying iPhone5, I personally would never buy any product upon it''s release, wait for all the bugs to be fixed first (although I would never buy an iPhone5 or iPad for that matter as Samsung is better, imho of course), read as many reviews and then only make the purchase if I am satisfied and sure. But in case of guns, especially a new entrant in the market, the wait needs to be longer for it to become a long established company known for quality and safety, for owner to be totally comfortable carrying and using, otherwise it''s guns could kill &/or seriously harm one. This is not an iPhone or S4, it is a gun that''s primary purpose is SD, to kill or seriously injure.\n\nCaracal''s initial responses (or customer service ''per se'') by ''I am so and so'' on this forum was abysmal and darn right rude to say the least (and that could be due to various reasons, arrogance, political, to bury the matter before it reaches the HQ and WW audience etc etc) flamed the anti-Caracal customer service and products sentiment and responses from members (rightly so!) but their later responses from HQ have been mixed bag but polite at least. Gut feeling is that they are going to take a very looooooooong time for replacements to reach PK customers of faulty production batches or drag it for so long that they will ultimately stop the supply to PK. \n\nAs for muslim brotherhood another member mentioned, we all know how well PK labour class and our Green Passport holders are treated in UAE by locals and what they think of us, so don''t expect a red carpet treatment from them when it comes to PK. Pakistan is a tiny market for them (locally made guns far exceed foreign imports) that they could stop supply to, as it won''t make much different to their Bottom Line Profits. It is all about making PROFITS and no-brainer  closing operations/supply to countries that can hurt their reputation in their major profit markets, especially where 1 incident (in a very low margin country) prompts a major recall. And they won''t even name Pakistan in their recall announcement on their site, where the incident actually took place. That says a lot!\n\nAs for Customer Service and how it should be, it reminds me of Johnson''s & Johnson''s recall of one their products. The moment the CEO found out of the QC/manufacturing issue with one of the creams, he sent an immediate announcement WW and pulled the product off the shelves within days, bearing company millions of dollars in losses but he saved the company. Caracal owners should not be expecting such a treatment, especially as reports are already in this thread that dealers are either oblivious of the recall or are simply ignoring it and selling to buyers who don''t know of the recall. Caracal could put an immediate full stop of faulty C''s and recall every pistol shipped to Pakistan in a very short time frame but they won''t, it''s just like dealing with a bad dealer who sold you a faulty gun, will ignore your calls, make excuses and not be at shop when you visit. \n\nAnd ALL Product Recalls have a timeline .... so less customers know, less products to replace in the timeframe. Correct me if I am wrong in saying that Caracal do not offer lifetime warranty of their guns.', ''),

You have quite the story to tell to your grand kids later on in life :)\n\nSince such pertinent topics have been discussed in this post, I have a few questions that I''d really appreciate some advice (or insight) on:\n\n1. What if no CCTV footage, or witnesses, were there at the time of the shooting i.e no way to validate whether you had "indeed" been mugged. How does law enforcement tackle such issues. \n\n2. A friend mentioned that (and this makes absolutely no sense to me) it may be illegal to shoot someone if their intention is to steal (not kill or seriously injure you). Is the use of lethal force justified if...say...muggers attempt to steal my cellphone at gunpoint?[/QUOTE]\n\nVery valid points.....I''m no legal expert but owing to the post-incident experience that I had, I can just tell you that:\n1. Eye witnesses (the guards in this case), the Police already know gangs operating in the areas if not exactly when, my credentials, cellphone in his pocket (nothing removed from the scene) and his own weapon. Rest, you know if someone wants to implicate you, its very easy to do so if you are just a commoner.\n2. If a bad guy wants to steal something from me with no intent to kill, he could bring along his friends, forcibly pull me out of the car, slap and punch me, not use any weapon and run away with all my valuables. But the gun obviously means something and in a number of incidents, BGs have used weapons against non-cooperating brave men.', ''),

I know everywhere it was reported that he was using glock 17 but what about those empties shown on tv? Fudgepacker is right since the new smith&wesson 40 round was introduced no agency carry 10mm, but again he was a private contractor and a private contractor can carry anything he likes.

In fact while using peep sight, the user has to forget the peep hole and only concentrate on the front sight and the target. Its the human brain that always keeps your eye 100% at the center of the peep hole unintentionally. This is the basic principle of using peep. I mean that when the peep hole will be only a couple of inches away from your eye, you will feel that you are seeing through a big hole. Then you will have to ignore the peep hole (dont try to see through the centre of the hole) while peeping through the peep hole. You will be automatically seeing through the centre of the hole unintentionaly.\n\nBut when you put the peep hole on the original rear sight, you voilate the whole priciple of working of peep sight and hence you cannot get good results.\n\nIf you can come to my home before leaving for KPK, we can finalize your 54.', ''),

If you do get Chinese, load her up with Prvi hollow points for self defence purposes - do see whether its safe to use Prvi hollow points from a Chinese Tokarev since these are some seriously nasty and "hot" rounds. \n\nIn my humble opinion, the Tokarev is a great CC gun, but it does have 2 glaring faults:\n\n1. Limited mag capacity: This is somewhat offset by the potent caliber itself and the ability to easily carry extra slim, single stack mags.\n\n2. Lack of safety: There are only two ways to effectively carry a TT - Condition 3 carry and half cock. Condition 3 carry involves chambering a round before the gun can be fired. Or....you could chamber a round and gently bring the hammer down to half cock. This will seize the slide and the trigger.

Will it be possible to get this conversion kit from the market?. And will it be legal? The reason is that we have given up using .22 long time ago as these were considered toys and the market is now fully occupied by 9mm due to its versatility. But at the same time 22 has its vide use for sporting purpose and variety of ammo (it is perhaps cost effective). We often love to shoot targets but the practice annoys the neighbors.

(545703, ' [B][COLOR=#ff0000]NITA THUMB-BREAK PADDLE HOLSTER:[/COLOR][/B]  This is the NITA (Thailand) holster that I bought for the Glock 17. My choice of holsters is based mostly on nylon (military grade if available). Second choice and perhaps the last is Kydex ones. I for some reasons DO NOT like or prefer the leather. Sure the leather one looks cool. The strange choice in selecting holsters with regards to the material will be covered later. Just a quick review of this one which I loved and instantly picked up.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]23787[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]23788[/ATTACH]\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]MAIN CONSIDERATIONS:[/B][/COLOR] This is a OC holster for pants etc and can be used in CC mode while in Shalwar Qameez. By and large the shape remains like the rest of the ones out there. Its not large in size but covers my Glock very adequately including the trigger guard and pretty much everything else except for the grip. A holster does NOT necessarily have to be too expensive or carrying a premium brand name with all the bells and whistles to perform as you want. My prime concerns are that [B]a holster should be able to [COLOR=#ff0000]cover the gun[/COLOR] from all the dirt and debris, have soft inner lining/padding to almost [COLOR=#ff0000]nullify the chances of wear[/COLOR] for many years, [COLOR=#ff0000]comfortable[/COLOR] and above all [COLOR=#ff0000]fast to draw[/COLOR][/B] a weapon from. Yes, I know, I''ve asked everything from one poor holster. But there are still few points I left out. Go figure them out.\n\n[FONT=arial][B]This is a fixed paddle holster for the right hand. The holster offers a thumb-break system (the way I like it) for securing the Glock and from being unsuspectedly drawn by someone else. In the following picture you can see the thumb-break and the soft padded lining that runs all along the inside to protect from holster wear.[/B][/FONT]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]23793[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]23794[/ATTACH]\nSo far, I''ve worn the holster for a few days for almost 5-6 hours continuously per day. Its comfortable. The holster itself does not weigh anything but obviously with a G17 with two magazines housing 16 rounds each, is bound to keep reminding you of the bad boy on you. So I figured out a way. I had an old cellphone pouch of generally same material and colour, which I have on the left side of the waist. It can take the second magazine (total capacity of three magazines). This distributes the weight to a great degree. \nSo this is how it fits and looks. Comfortable and secure.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]23730[/ATTACH]', ''),

(545888, ' [QUOTE=Glock17;383570]^^ Verve bhai, after reading your post, my reaction came in like:\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]23703[/ATTACH] Don''t known how Caracal missed out the opportunity of offering the Caracal pistols to the Pakistan Army when the induction of a new 9mm was already underway couple of years back. Maybe the Caracal pistol was not ready by then and the Army had already signed an agreement with Sarsilmaz. Or perhaps, the Turkish metallurgy was more reliable if not superior to Caracal (UAE). Could it be the lack of external safety as a standard requirement? There must be something that made the army opt for Sarsilmaz.[/QUOTE]\n\nGlock bro, I have had first hand experience of dealing directly with Turkish manufacturers including Stoeger and XNARMS. Very friendly and fast response times, they answer the calls on their website advertised number and put you through to the right person immediately. I wanted some extra mags ordered as a friend was visiting Istanbul, and these guys emailed me a list of all their stockists near his hotel (along with expected retail price to pay per mag, US$25 for a Stoeger mag), but at the same time both advised to get permit to export the mags. Sourcing the mags was not an issue (contacts there know a few LEA officers) but cancelled the purchase to avoid any complications at the airports. \n\nCustomer service matters a lot, both Stoeger and XNARMS went out of their way to assist, after just one phone call conversation and exchange of few emails. And I don''t think our brothers here have had any major issues with Turkish made guns so far either. Knowing all too well that I was calling from PK, they treated me well, and Turks have a soft spot for Pakistanis in general as well. They are educated and very well mannered nation and proud of their heritage, and do not forget who supported them in difficult times. When an airport Taxi driver finds out that you are from Pakistan, they genuinely treat you with respect and are very friendly indeed and that''s not just to get a tip etc. \n\nPerhaps this is why the Pak Army went with Sarsilmaz instead of Caracal and Turks have multiple manufacturers of reliable weapons compared to the only one Caracal of UAE. If Turks treat an over the phone Pakistani customer that well (as far as my personal experience goes), they would surely be treating the Pak Army even better in customer services.', ''),

His second name wasn''t mentioned throughout by any channel almost like they''re protecting his identity or fabricating the name. Theres much detail to this but to keep things simple in the first glance the guns look suspiciously fake, even if they are real they''re local made. Id urge PG members to not believe what the media says these days, only take it as information not to be trusted. If police was not political and was free to do whatever they felt right as a proper LEA should be, this Sikander (fake name) would''ve been given a 10 minute ultimatum after which he would be shot so many times that he would''ve been unidentifiable.

In this instance, the tough and solid structure of a tank is being implied to the gun. Also, it is Russian, and Russians being known for their heavy military machinery (think army parades in the Red Square), is another reason why the Baikal is called/described as, a "tank".\n\nAnother example is like saying a shotgun firing 3.5" magnum 12gauge slugs, kicks like a "horse" or, recoils like a "canon".\n\nBTW, congrats on the gun, it''s a great first piece!

I think we have gotten so caught up in foreign breeds and the status they give us, we have completely neglected our beautiful local breeds. We bred Cheena with a Quetta Gaddhi Kutta (desi sheepdog). We got a very good litter, now that litter is fully grown and even more majestic than the sire and dam. Cheena is an excellent guard dog, another hurdle for BG who tries to come to my house unwanted/uninvited. \n[/QUOTE]\nVery nice dog! \n\nComing towards local breeds, my take on the issue is, foreign breeds is a very vague statement; there are 1000s of breeds and most are good! However most popular ones here are Labradors, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, American Pitbull Terriers. They excel in what they''re meant for, and are going by fixed standards to keep up to the mark. \nPakistanis don''t take care of animals, they just want money. They interbreed good breeds with mutts and ruin the breeds.\nThey grow the trait of dog aggression in BULLY KUTTA to earn HARAM bucks, they make the dogs fight for what they lack themselves (manhood). Therefore I believe it would take long before a breed standard is created. The dogs is mostly sleepy apart from fights, and eats a lot and requires vigorous exercise which is a task in city area.\n\nI wouldn''t mind keeping a true GAME BULLY KUTTA (which is muscular and quite frisky, alert) unlike the ones we have today which are only good for sh*t (dog fighting); a ''sport'' of the losers.\n\nA well bred, true standard bully kutta is a very nice dog, one of my favorites. The breed is not very intelligent or active and yet has to prove itself in personal protection! No mastiff does guarding better than a Presa Canario.', ''),

(546199, ' Tell you the truth Dr, I haven''t shot the 10mm yet... \nI''ve always been a 1911 guy and never liked the G17 too much because the grip felt large and blocky in comparison. First impression when I got the G20 (same frame as G21) was that it is noticably larger and heavier than a 17, and that''s with the SF frame. But despite the larger size, it''s more comfortable in my small hands, because my finger joints just meet up more naturally with the edges of the grip. Also, since this is just a range gun, I chose the Gen3 because I like the smoother texturing more. Again, it just feels more comfortable in my hands. But for a defence gun, the more aggressive polymid checkering on Gen4''s would definitely be advantageous. I''ll give a shooting report after I get a chance to visit the range.', ''),
(546200, ' You are right Birdshooter007 bro, 90% of people owning bully kuttas today are of the sort you have just mentioned. I am just an enthusiast and enjoy the breed and my family has kept them for years now. I can safely say that I have quite some experience with owning this breed and yes if they are kept as fighters they will become lazy and useless otherwise. But if they are trained to guard your house and kept as companion dogs, believe me in a climate such as that of Pakistan they do their job perfectly. My dogs are awake and alert 24/7 and are great companions. I believe it is a misunderstood breed and many losers keep this breed for dog fighting. But if you happen to have an experience with one as a pet and raise them as your companion  dog believe me they are the most suited for the environment in terms of their endurance and immunity they can withstand the harshest of climates. They are fearless, they will not be afraid to attack an intruder, they are extremely loyal and I have never had an unpredictable bully kutta in my life. There was only one exception and he had been beaten by his previous owner and had no home since he had been exchanged between 10 to 12 owners. I think it is a largely misunderstood breed and we should work more on it and appreciate its beauty.', ''),

(546334, ' After seeing all the footage and various commentaries on TV, my 2p ... it seems the guy was perhaps well connected or thought he was (some speculation around him mentioning hosting high profile politicians and ISI seniors to the SSP) and this was likely an act of desperation to get some personal or business matters resolved by getting certain politicians''/agencies attentions, hence he was not allowed to be taken down. 6 hours +, the law ministry showed total incompetence ..... police was ready to take him down in a very short time (without killing him) but even that was stopped by powers above.\n\n- Media was at fault for letting the guy talk on TV - just plain stupid. A guy breaking the law in the heart of the Capital city and they are on phone with him.\n- LEA/Police were at fault for not cordoning off at least the full length of the sector and not allowed media and public to get as close as they did. Closing the length of a sector on Jinnah Avenue should have been sufficient, with only LEA/Police and the assailant there. They are great at putting containers to block Jinnah Avenue on a short notice but couldn''t contain this situation!!!\n- General public ... how stupid can one be in trying to get as close as possible to watch and put their own lives in danger!\n- And Mr Hero or Mr Zero, well .... If you don''t know how to tackle such a situation, have no offensive & defensive martial arts training to high standards and are way above your BMI (body mass index) to move fast enough, then don''t involved. Darn right stupid move, but one that left LEA no choice but to neutralise the guy.\n\nAnd yes, agreed with other members that the licence restrictions will become tougher now and it is going to hurt those who genuinely want to get licences for SD & HD with the law situation getting not improving.\n\nPersonally, if I was in that area and was stranded (stuck in traffic etc) and within even the range the media got to (and that was more than close enough), I would have taken him down when he was strolling around outside the car alone (family in car) firing in the air as long as no-one was behind him. And then face the Judge(s) without any hesitation.\n\nIf this was USA or UK or even country like Malaysia for that matter, he would have been taken down by snipers or pistol sharp shooters by the third warning issued within first 10 minutes on such a wide open road without any hostages.\n\nOverall, the whole incident stinks and politicians are in it for sure.', ''),

And I can''t sleep ... it''s a wife free weekend :rockon:\n\n1 - Are you trained in any martial arts?\n2 - If not trained in any, which interests you the most?\n\n\nI started training at 13 in school and stopped after completing 2nd Dan in WTF Taekwondo. Then much later a friend, master in Jiu-Jitsu, taught a group of us close friends the Jiu-Jitsu and Krav Maga fusion version - specifically for very close range (clubbing and group fights). \n\nTaekwondo is not a soft art/sport but more on defensive and long range offensive side and requires space (for example, a 1-1 fight on the street etc), but the Jiu-Jitsu and Krav-Maga fusion is lethal. My friend, about 5ft 4" and slim, took on 5 large body builder type British African guys and in less than a minute all 5 were out cold on the dance floor. The brute speed of fists and elbows with head and neck being the targets, I find it frightening the damage a trained person can do in such a very very short timeframe. \n\nI personally avoid and dislike starting or getting involved in fights and always give warning to others to ''let''s cool down and we all walk away unhurt before someone ends up in hospital with permanent damages'' and it diffused many fights. A few where it didn''t work, I won''t divulge into details as to what happened to them. I don''t drink so muting an intoxicated person is easier as they think they are moving fast but infact they are slower.\n\n\n\nBut it is different here in PK, too many illegal gun carriers so for SD a gun is a necessity where a warning shot or more can diffuse a situation. I don''t look forward to such a situation hence avoid travelling late in known ''dakoo'' areas. Last year Ramzan, on the way to ISB, M2 was blocked by protesters so had to get off before Sial services to rejoin the M2 at Bhera Toll - asked directions from a farmer and his son came up and said ''aap ne bus rukna nahi hai, tayz garri'' and I was '':doh:, this is dakoo territory'' and called my brother to confirm and received the bollocking :rant: ''why the **** did you get off the motorway, did you not know that majority of the areas around the motorway are dangerous for night travel? leave the phone call running, and get the **** out of there before sunset*. I killed the suspension of my car that day, unknown roads and area, so it was pedal to metal - window down, Cougar chambered sitting in the lap and shotgun chambered on passenger floor pan & seat. Thanks Allah I got to Bhera Toll just around sunset, as a day later shootings were reported with some cars looted on the same roads after sunset. And a suspension check and complete overhaul the next day, with everything replaced from track-rods, track rod ends, anti-roll bar links, every bushing, engine mounts and full set of new shocks and springs - 2 bent shocks!! :mad2: ... never driven a stock vti (and that too a SOHC one instead of DOHC) that hard other than only track prepared cars on race tracks before. Roads were screaming ''i''m going to kill your car and you'' and treating your car as well as your wife (or better - hope she doesn''t read this) :violin: paid off that day as she didn''t go off the road considering over 100km/h speeds on potholes infested and broken single lane bendy roads through farms.', ''),
(546340, ' Returned from Madinah Al Munawarah in early morning to Makkah Al Mukarmah after spending a couple of days there, I was tired but couldn''t sleep so start checking morning newspaper online. Saw this sad incident reporting and YouTube clips. Feeling sad and bad for whatever happening due to incompetence, negligence and continuous stupidity of persons responsible for administration and security in homeland. It is result of decades of institutional malpractices & deterioration in discipline, training, brainstorming, research, merit as well as brain drain of capable and intelligence capital from country.\r\n\r\nFollowing are my two cents on situation and recommendations.\r\n\r\nHandling of an incident such like this (God forbid, he would be a real terrorist with some hostages in a lorry or wagon??? or wearing explosive belt?) requires special handlings. There should be an agency or teams deployed in every region with members consisting very well trained management, administration, legal, commandos, negotiators, doctors, psychiatrists, intelligence (humint & cyber) as well as resources including lethal (Sniper Systems with coordination interfaces, Target Pistols, SMGs) as well as less than \r\nlethal (Tasers & stuns - our ASF Martials/commandos have these, Pepper Spray, Stun Batons, Rubber Bullets, Stun Grenades, Water Canons, Focused energy weapons, tranquilizer guns), Enabling Technologies like coordinated camera systems and thermal/IR imagers and spotting scopes for situational awareness and decision support. \r\n\r\nALso they should have proper trainings, use cases & scenarios exercised and well planned/sorted out to tackle most of such situations.\r\n\r\nThis incident is evident of at least following shortcomings;\r\n\r\n1. Police Check posts :- Usually their main job is deterrence and avoidance. They are not proper planned and manned. Due to rush or improper handing a lot of vehicles gather there and increase potentially causalities chances God forbid if any blast occur.\r\n2. There must be explosive and drug scanners available at all check posts. Only suspicious vehicle should be removed from column to a designed secure area for further investigation. Proper manning will help check further vehicles after one is removed from lane.\r\n3. Remote observation cameras must be installed to check incident in anticipation and also for performance checks.\r\n4. A rapid action SWAT team should be ready with ground and areal \r\nsupport for quick deployment/follow-up.\r\n5. Arial monitoring drones should be acquired and every team should have one. At least in large cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta & Multan.\r\n6. An emergency advisory board with members from Management, Administration, Forces, Intelligence, Academia & Civil with adequate Knowledge, trainings and interest should be formed for policy, guidelines & standards reforms as well as should be available at zero time notice to meet and advise on any emergency situation.   special \r\ninterest groups must be formed for research and advice on policy & law making. Suggestions and expert advice must be sought after from armed civilians community-civil society and retired LEA personnel with excellent track record. (This will avoid a firearms law formation mentioning allowed caliber of 45 inches or less, ridiculously large enough that no canon in world or even in fiction can compare.\r\n\r\nComing to incident, any civilian should not be allowed to go to suspect for negations. Proper planning and simulation could result in coordinated negotiation cum stunning/temp disorientation cum commando action could result in a less than 15 second operation with least risk involved for LEA, Family, Suspect & spectators. Also media should show responsibility, educated and learned reporting and avoid bizarre aimless bubbling ending no where.', ''),

First impression when I got the G20 (same frame as G21) was that it is noticably larger and heavier than a 17, and that''s with the SF frame.

Believe me, real case scenarios are way different then that.  Deploying drones in such circumstances looks thrilling but this phenomenon is in very early stages in worlds most developed and rich nations. Yes, police sharp shooter''s should have shot him on his hand, but they couldn''t even shot him accurately on his legs, frankly, i doubt their ability to shoot his arm.

In simple words the man was armed with pistols not smg or assault rifles, the ammo and firearms were prone to malfunction and they did the very last moment his one gun jammed and police shot him after that now this is sad actually police shot sikandar when he was unarmed, interior minister himself said that his guns jammed luckily, i have seen a video here on pakguns where a LEA officer takes a shot at some object over the head of his fellow member, where were these guys ?', ''),

But do you guys really believe that he should have been taken down in front of his kids, just because he blocked main Jinnah Avenue in Islamabad. If that is so, then all long march organizers and leaders should face the same fate. It is very easy to sit in front of TV and do gossip about the situation that who is doing write and who is doing wrong and what should be done. Believe me, real case scenarios are way different then that.  Deploying drones in such circumstances looks thrilling but this phenomenon is in very early stages in worlds most developed and rich nations. Yes, police sharp shooter''s should have shot him on his hand, but they couldn''t even shot him accurately on his legs, frankly, i doubt their ability to shoot his arm.

But unfortunately, our law enforcements lacks both.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nSubzero bro, the guy was firing in the air in Blue Area with roads, buildings and houses around and the bullets coming down could have killed anyone, . He was terrorising and putting innocent lives at risk, so whether his kids, wife or 18 million people were watching, he should have been neutralised there and then. There are absolutely no excuses for his behaviour of blocking Jinnah Avenue and walking around like a badmaash with 2 weapons firing in the air, no matter who he is. He is lucky that this is Pakistan, if he was in Europe, he would have been put down with a headshot while sat in the driver seat with his family in the car, after just having exposed the weapons let alone allowed to do havai firing. But they would have issued him with a warning or 2 at least to get out the car.\n\nHe put his own family at risk, not LEA or anyone else.

My licenses from DC east, despite being backdated were finally computerized.\n\nRegarding the auth. letter we have had discussed this topic with him before... On his explanation previously he was making licenses on HS quota and not on DC quota... for HS quota, the DC weapon branch receives a letter with names of people who should be issued with licenses, now since its the DC himself he said there is no need of letter. One of our member here said even before when DC east guy made his DC quota license he gave him a letter in which DC himself advised DC''s weapon branch to issue license...

Located specifically to the point where the external ring  ataches to the barrel ( for assembling it with the rest of the shotgun ),\n\nUnfortunately, In Semiautos due to design considerations they provide a very solid big and hard ring and here comes the problem while machining/attaching this thing to the barrel with high pressure, it creates a rent, a crack, a depression or groove to the inside of barrel from  the  force exerted outside.\n\nAnd I have seen more than 20 Semiautos in last 10 days all have those crcacks some less & some more but nobody was without defect.\n\nAnd most important of all, they all have cracks at exactly the same anticipated site.\n\nBelieve me barrels of such type are no better than Desi shotguns, even local made dont have cracks like it.\n\nHope this thing does not behave like Caracal because in Shotgun Kaboom danger is much more even if it did not cause other catridges to explode the barrel  explosion is sufficient to amputate your left hand or even worse because left will be the hand holding the magazine tube,\n\nGod save us all', ''),

Sig Sauer P239 (9mm) ------ Asking 2,35,000/- NIB\n\n2. Taurus PT145 (.45 ACP) ----- No idea (NIB)\n\n3. CZ Rami (9mm) ------------- Asking 1,18,000/-\n\nIf there is any other option for a secondary sub compact, please share your thoughts. Remember, this is going to be a secondary weapon and will be used / carried in conjunction with the primary weapon that is G17 G4.[/QUOTE]\n\nPersonally my favorite is the 145 only because it packs a bigger punch plus you have a different calibre with you to enjoy at the range but the Rami is a great choice as well.', ''),

(547002, ' 1st of all, a warm welcome to the forum mate :) To be honest I''d rather have the mod 135 due to its beautiful walnut wood stock (but that''s a personal choice :) ) also, of what I''ve read the 135 is just a tad bit faster than the 125, not a huge difference though. \n\nHowever, velocity becomes secondary without accuracy, and these guns won''t disappoint you there, but, the choice of caliber is critical. These guns perform BEST and to their potential in .22 and .25 cal! The .177 cal in these guns, in my opinion, will only disappoint you. The reason being that this will shoot even the 10 grain pellet (which is considered heavy in this cal) at over 1000 fps and due to the lower pellet weight and high velocity, the accuracy is most likely to suffer, especially over longer distances.\n\nIf only cal you can shoot is .177, I''d strongly suggest you look for a Diana (Mod 31, 34,35 etc) or a Weihrauch airgun which shoots in the range of 15-18 fpe at the muzzle. Those should serve you a lot better esp as far a the accuracy is concerned. There is no point in having whopping velocities when you''re not able to hit what you aim at, it''ll only frustrate you :).', ''),

Could you clear it up for us?[/B][/QUOTE]\nRegarding magazine cocktails and Dutch loads, there are many reasons why modern tactitions recommend against them. First, consistency. Consistency of the firearm as it pertains to reliable functioning and consistency of the shooter as it pertains to accuracy. Every different brand of bullet will have different points of impact, and different recoil signatures, let alone different types. That is also why you should train with with the gun and the ammo you carry. Second, analysis data collected from LEA''s, shows that in confrontations involving deadly force, only 1/3 of the bullets they fire hit their target. With civilians that ratio diminishes. Also, in civilian self defense shootings the average number of shots fired is 3 within three to seven feet. Which means its most likely that only one of those shots will find its target. Therefore, that totally negates the theoretical advantage of having alternating types of bullets. Furthermore, with the 2 missed shots, at least one of them will be an FMJ if coming from a Dutch loaded magazine, and that greatly increases the risk to innocents. Remember, President Ronald Regan was almost assassinated by the ricochet from a 22lr! Third, modern JHP rounds have enough penetration performance for just about any self defense situation. For example, they have more than enough power to go through layered heavy winter clothing, shooting through windshields will take several shots from any hand gun caliber regardless of bullet type, and if you find your target behind a car door or a wall, you probably should cease fire anyways since most likely he no longer poses a threat to your life at that point, or is already retreating but that gets into legal and moral issues which are whole other issues. \n\nThere is further reasoning based on statistal analysis of angles, distances, and ballistics, but the above mentioned are the most important and most relevant. To summarize, based on what Ive been taught, I believe the best solution is a magazine full of high quality modern self defense rounds because they have good barrier penetration, excellent expansion performance, and highly reduces instances of over penetration and ricochet, and to ensure accuracy. That''s my opinion at this point in time, but that''s subject to change as equipment and ammo evolves. But most importantly, you have to be confident in your gear choices for your individual situation, so just beware of false confidence, and do what you are comfortable with.', ''),

Prices vary between cities, just like the Mini-Mag is 25rs to 27rs in Lahore and 23rs in Peshawar, and 35rs for Winchester Super X in ISB and 20rs in Peshawar - huge differences. I would assume the starting price would be 80K upwards NIB at least.

(547549, ' The Glock vs Sig debate is the same as the Polymer vs steel, the striker vs hammer, or the 1911 vs everything else :p debate. Its all a matter of personal preference. \n\nI, personally, prefer Sigs because they (in my opinion) look better, feel better, have a decocker, and are (mostly) made of metal and have an external hammer. This is not to say that a Glock (especially the Glock 17) is a bad gun, far from it actually. The Glock is reliable, dependable, and an extremely serviceable firearm. \n\nNow, coming to the Sig P250 vs Glock 17 debate. No, just...no. The Glock that you have is a far superior weapon in almost every aspect (not including fit and feel, which is completely subjective anyway). If it were a P226 or something along those lines, I''m afraid I''d have to side with your friend. :p O, and regarding accuracy, Glocks often outshoot their owners - nothing wrong with them if the shooter does his/her part. \n\n@Glock 17: Since you''ve already searched the market for Sigs, what kind of variety are we looking at over here? Apart from the ubiquitous P226 and its variants. Specifically, I''m interested in whether you''ve been able to find the Sig P938 or the P238 models. Lemme know and thanks!', ''),
