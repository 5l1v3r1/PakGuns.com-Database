(I couldn''t suggest anything new, EVERYTHING is covered, already)\n\n2) [I]Anti-card [/I]writ, demanding retention of copy system.\n\n3) A re-validation [I]pro[/I] writ, but with comprehensive suggestions for the correct modus operandi, i.e, bar coding of licenses/sticker adhesion, etc, and with longer time period for record compilation than the short periods being given now, as to offset working load at Nadra and ease dealing with license holders.\n\n4) Claiming [I]non-responsibility[/I] upon the re-validation seeking license holders of any irregularities at the MOI and banks with respect to compilation of records, instead concerned officials should rather be held responsible, as license holders cannot interfere with the official workings of govt. offices, but in good faith and belief applied for the docs, met all criteria and deposited dues to government accounts, and consequently did all the required entries of their weapons at concerned authorities, i.e DCO offices, etc. \n\nHence, re-validation process by itself is o.k, but with retention of copy license system and with a more reasonable, practical modus operandi.\n\nI thanked petitioner on behalf of sincere, law respecting gun enthusiasts of PakGuns.Com, and it would be interesting to see the progress of the proceedings, starting from Oct.5.\n\nPetitioner is a true gentleman and with a vast knowledge into both guns and laws on guns, as well as constitutional issues. \n\nBear in mind, the ongoing revalidation process and follow up license cancellations if not done before given time limits, is no "gazetted" movement also, so let''s see, pray for the best and expect anything.\n\nTop of the line lawyer is handling the writ.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(380522, ' @Taha, Hussain Ali, Guns4me, Bilal, Airsoft, S.Cheema, Ameer, Achilles, WasifAli89, Ka_Khan Thank you.  Here is the shooting review.\n\n[B]Shooting the Knight Hawk:\n[/B]\nSince I plan to play around with these guns for a few weeks I bought 3 packs of 4000 BB''s each and 3 cans of gas. Each gas can should last around 2500 shots. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4594[/ATTACH]\n\nFilling the mag up with gas:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4593[/ATTACH]\n\nFirst target shot on Rapid at 10 Meters. Once you start shooting it''s so much fun you empty the entire clip. I also tried to see how fast I could fire it and shot 4 bb''s per second. The entire clip was done in around 4 seconds.  (Target below). Shooting the gun was a lot of fun although filling the mag was bit of a pain in the backside. 3 times out of 5 it would not fill properly and I would run out of power after 8/10 shots. Having to shake the can before each refill is absolutely essential. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4596[/ATTACH]\n\nAfter a bit of fun at 10 Meters I moved back to 15 meters and tried to shoot with a bit of concentration. The group was decent enough.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4592[/ATTACH]\n\nSince it was shooting around 6 inch groups at 15 M I thought why not test it at 25 M and see what happens. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4599[/ATTACH]\n\nAt 25 M I had to aim at the 7 digit at 12 o clock. The bb drop at this range was very noticeable as I could clearly see the BB dropping in an arc like trajectory before hitting the target. The drop was almost 12 inches at 25 M''s and the shots were not consistent at all. \n\nThe fps (feet per second / speed) drop was very noticeable. The manufacturer claims this gun shoots at 300 fps when it leaves the barrel but at 25 M the fps drops to less than 125 or perhaps even 100 fps. Of course this is not meant to be fired from this distance.\n\nAs the fps decreases so does the hitting power. This below target was shot from all three distances. 10, 15 and 25. You can see the results below:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4601[/ATTACH]\n\nA energy saver was pissing me off so ;) (Shot at 15 M''s)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4595[/ATTACH]\n\nRapid fire from 6 Meters:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4598[/ATTACH]\n\nSome friends asked about recoil, noise etc. Well, compared to an airgun it has even lesser recoil (infact non at all) and less sound than an air gun as well. I tried hunting a few lizards around my house yesterday with it for good fun and after I emptied a clip or two most of them looked like they wanted to say "are you kidding me?". Did shoot one but for your Lizard hunting needs, most Airguns would kick Airsoft''s behind. It might however be a little unfair to compare an air rifle with an air pistol so next week when Airsoft''s rifle battery''s and chargers are delivered I plan to unleash hell on the local lizard populace with my fully auto M4 shape Air soft. \n\n[B]Conclusion:[/B] These guns priced at Rs. 15,000 with around Rs. 2,500 more for gas and BB''s are fun. I can''t really say I would prefer them over Airguns because the single shot Airgun teaches you to value and weigh each and every shot because in the time it takes you to reload your gun your target would have gotten away. That patience learned to take the perfect shot also teaches other aspects of real shooting like trigger control and concentration on sight alignment. A good airgun shooter when he graduates to firearms will be a good hunter and a good shooter. \n\nAirsoft items also teach important things like gun safety and firearms responsibility (bb''s at short ranges really hurt) but  they are more of a fun item with the mantra of spray and pray kind of shooting. \n\nI recommend getting one to play around with specially if it''s a rifle but remember, while somewhat dangerous these are just toys.', ''),

[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]For the petitioners, Barrister Ali Zafar argued that the process for issuance of arms licenses, ownership of the firearms, their sale and purchase and exchange as well as issuance of ammunition all have been prescribed under Pakistan Arms Ordinance 1965 and Arms Rules of 1924. Mr Ali said that only way to amend the said rules to bring the same in line government scheme of computerization of the licenses, is through the gazetted notification which has not been pursued by the government. The government, he contended, has instead, issued directions in the form of publications in the newspapers requiring all the arms license holders, who were issued licences prior to January 1, 2011, to surrender their arms licenses to Nadra and that they should move application for securing the new licenses. The counsel assailed this direction describing the same illegal and without lawful in as much as that no notification has been issued for this purpose and that directions in question also do not contain any rules for transfer of the firearms or issuance of the ammunition. The counsel appreciated the step of computerization of the licenses however he stressed that the process should be contained in the said Rules as they deal with all aspects of the matter including possession, transport, sale etc. He said without this being in place the entire scheme of the Ministry of Interior to for computerisation of the licenses will be futile and will amount to violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioners. [/FONT][/SIZE]\n[SIZE=3][FONT=Calibri]After hearing the petitioner counsel at the preliminary stage, the Court issued notice to the federal government to seek appearance of the law office on the next date of hearing.[/FONT][/SIZE]', ''),

Pictures and directions below: \n\nPicture quality is not that great because had to take the pictures while walking, the firearms dealers there (like every where I suppose) don''t want pictures taken of their shops or display windows.\n\nOld Siam Plaza on the left (White building). The shops you see on the center and right are all firearms shops.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4491[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4494[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4490[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4489[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4492[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4493[/ATTACH]\n\nIn Old Siam Plaza itself you''ll only find one shop on the third floor called Advantage Arms I think. They have some nice BlackHawk accessories. The rest of the stuff you''ll find in the 25 or so shops surrounding the plaza. \n\nThe firearms shops close at 5 SHARP. Some dealers who mostly deal in guns and less in accessories will not deal with foreigners. Don''t insist, you''ll find another shop close by willing to sell you what you want.\n\nHow to get there: Take the MRT to the last stop which is called Hua Lampong. Outside the station just get into a cab, tell them to turn the meter on and take you to Old Siam. Some drivers will not understand Old Siam so I suggest asking the Concierge at your hotel to write Old Siam Plaza in Thai for you on a piece of paper and Hua Lampong on another. This way just show the note to the driver, sit back, it''s a 15 min drive there from the MRT. Should cost around 60 THB (Rs. 180).', ''),

(379569, ' Brother: Kindly correct me if i am wrong but is this to be a bug-out bag? which is more or less a portable kit containing items you would require to survive during an evacuation for a set period of time in case of  an actual or imminent disaster (earthquake? possible Tsunami?).   If this is the purpose, then i would not refer it to as an ''intruder bag''. If you want things handy to protect yourself from an intruder then instead of a bag, just keep appropriate weapon(s) with flashlight (preferably integrated) in handy/secure locations where you can access them quickly (having it on person , or in the case of an office maybe  under your desk, or in your bedroom at your side).\n\nfor  a bug out bag, i wouldnt want the bag to be too heavy in case roads are compromised (gridlocked/ damaged) but other than the things you have mentioned, i would also add the following:\n1- some sort of a fire starter (a lighter? matches?)\n2- Map of the area / city\n3- Compass\n4- cash and change (banks / atms would not be running in a possible disaster).\n5-  plastic sheeting ( can be used for a temp shelter or to lay on the ground).\netc.\n6- dry food / biscuits/ chocolates etc.\n7- some water and maybe water purification tablets maybe? \n8- a small portable radio? to listen to emergency broadcasts/ news etc?\n9- plastic coated copies of your identification like CNIC.\n\nbefore making such a bag i would first analyze for how long i would need the supplies to last me for?  if you are in a jungle than a SURVIVAL bag is what would be needed which would need more supplies. \n\nIf you really want to make such a bag, first order of business would be to clearly figure out  for how long you would need to survive and how far would you think you would need to go in order to survive.\n\nIf you dont want to evacuate , then just keep supplies in your home in a secure place for an emergency like situation.\n\na lot of survivalists are into these things and live by their BOBs (bug out bags) on the other hand  a lot of people are against such elaborate bags  as fruitless spending. i would suggest you best choose for yourself the option based on what your requirements are.', ''),

(379580, 'New T 06 guns come with 1 washer in rear slide [QUOTE=AzamAgha44;217959]My deliverance came through an unexpected source. Out of sheer desperation I dismantled the gun and suddenly I saw that one of the steel washers was missing from (two steel washer rubber sandwich)  on one end of the floating mechanism. This caused the gun to slide back on a slant during its recoil phase, instead of regular parallel slide back. this was causing shifting of aim as the rubber washer kept on getting compressed on one side instead of being securely sandwiched between two washers. I simply replaced the missing washer and bingo. now I am getting 1/2 to 3/4 inch groups at 40 yards, and one hollers at 15. Thank you all very much for your help and concern.....[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nDear,\r\n\r\nIts good that you have achieved good results by putting a metallic washer to make the rubber sandwich. In fact in T06 54 and 56TH, only one washer comes in the rear slide. In T06, the length of sliding rails is a bit more than T05. The angle of rails is also different, hence the washer is not given.\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"]Mine works accurately without additional washer.[/COLOR]\r\nSo I assume that this did not help you. Rather the reassembling of the gun helped you.\r\nThe other thing which could help you is adjusting the tightness of float of the slide mechanism. If you remove the rear stock screw, you can insert an L-key to tight or loose the  sliding mechanism of 56TH.\r\n\r\nGood luck', ''),

Each time they are shot, they lose a life. Therefore, a person with 3 lives is out of the game after being shot on 3 separate occasions. When shot, the player returns to the designated respawn point before rejoining the game. Each player can be give three ''chips'' and must give one to a marshal each time they are hit.\n \n[B]One Life Rule[/B]: One hit, and you are out of the game. You must wait for a new game to start before rejoining. \n \n[B]Medic Rule[/B]: Each team is given a Medic who can ''''resurrect'''' dead players. Players who have been hit must call out for the Medic, keep their hand(s) raised, lower their gun and not move position. When the Medic touches them, they rejoin the game instantly. If the medic is hit, he/she can rejoin the game in their current position after 30 seconds. They must count out this 30 seconds aloud.\n \nIn games with a large number of players, it is inevitable that some of those players will be ''taken out'' early in the game. These ''dead'' player would then have to stand around for 10-20 minutes waiting for the next game to begin. Therefore, for games with a large number of players it is preferably to used the Infinite Regen rule, Medic rule or the Multiple lives rule. Conversely, games with a small number of players work best with the One Life rule.\n \n[SIZE=3][B]***Game types***[/B][/SIZE]\n \n[B]Base Capture[/B]\nPlayers : A minimum of 4 people per team. No maximum.\nStarting points: Two Teams, starting at two predefined bases.\nObjective: To physically touch the opposing teams base structure.\nTime Limit : No time limit.\nRegen : Can be played with regen or single-life only. For games with large number of players, regen is preferably. \nComments: Works best with a medium number of players (about 20-30).\n \n[B]Last Team Standing[/B]\nPlayers : A minimum of 12 people. 4 people per team. \nStarting points: Teams should be evenly spaced among the playfield with an effort to provide equal cover for each team.\nObjective: Each team plays against all of the other teams. It''s a simple matter of wiping out every other team before they wipe out your team. The last team to remain is declared the winner.\nTime Limit : None\nRegen : No regen. Single lives only.\nComments: Fast and chaotic where the enemy is everywhere. More fun with large number of players (30+)\n \n[B]Traitor[/B]\nPlayers: Any number.\nStarting points: Two or more bases with equal teams.\nObjective: Prior to the game starting, the Marshals shall place a traitor or several traitors in each team. The teams play against each other, trying to eliminate the opposing team(s). At any point during the game, the traitors may attack the team that they have been assigned to. They can also signal to the opposing team that they are a traitor (and therefore not to be shot at). They can also deliberately miss when shooting at the opposing team. \nTime Limit : None. A signal however can be given at any time by the marshals to inform the traitors that they should ''attack now''.\nRegen : None. Single lives only\nComments : This game creates paranoia as players do not know who the traitor is on their team. Players need to keep an eye on their own team mates as well as the opposing team. The winner is determined by the last team standing.\n \n[B]Hostage[/B]\nPlayers: 15 or more suggested. Teams are split at a ratio of 2:1 (e.g.10 Bandits for every 5 Special forces), with one additional person as a hostage.\nStarting points: Bandits start at a base. Special Forces start at an Insertion/Pickup point.\nObjective: The Bandits team have a hostage who must be rescued by the Special Forces Team. The Special Forces must find and touch the Hostage before leading them safely back to the designated Insertion/pickup point. The Bandits must guard the hostage. The hostage can try to escape at any time. The hostage cannot be shot unless they try to escape. If the hostage is shot while escaping then the bandits win. The bandits also win if they eliminate all Special Forces. If the hostage reaches the pickup point alive, then the Special Forces team & the hostage wins.\nTime Limit : None\nRegen : None\nComments : Quite a hard game for the Special Forces. Success is possible with good teamwork, tactics and good aiming. A chance for teams to show off their skill.\n \n[B]Black Hawk Down[/B]\nPlayers: 25 or more suggested. There are 3 teams. Bandits, Pilots & Special Forces, at a ratio of 3:1:1 (e.g. teams of 15, 5 & 5 respectively)\nStarting points: Bandits start at a base central to the playing field. Pilots start in a random area fairly close to the Bandit Base but behind them. Special Forces start at an insertion point in front of the bandits (so they have to go through or around the Bandit base.\nObjective: The Special Forces need to get to the Pilots, and bring them safely back to their insertion point. The Special Forces and the Pilots win if any member of the Pilots team reach the insertion point. The Bandits win by eliminating all of the Pilots. It is not necessary for them to eliminate the Special Forces.\nTime Limit : This is usually a timed game with a 20-25 minute time limit for the suggested number of players. Failure to rescue the hostage within that time is a loss for the Special forces.\nRegen : Can be played with Medic Rule or the One Life Rule.\nComments: A popular game that requires speed and tactics to win.\n \n[B]Kaboom![/B]\nPlayers: Any number. Two teams of equal players.\nStarting points: The two teams should start at predefined bases. \nObjective: A ''bomb'' is place midway between the two bases. Each team must retrieve the bomb. Team A must bring it to their starting base and hold it for three minutes to diffuse it. Team B must bring the bomb to a designated bomb site where a three minute detonation countdown begins. The team that successfully holds the bomb at their designated area for three minutes wins. Team B must not be within 20 feet of the bomb when it detonates.\nTime Limit : None\nRegen : Infinite regen Rule applies.\nComments: Fast paced game usually accompanied by heroic efforts as the clock is ticking....\n \n[B]Base Control[/B]\nPlayers: Any number.\nStarting points: Two bases at opposite ends of the play field.\nObjective: An uneven number sub-bases should be marked on the playfield.. A chess clock/stopwatch is required at each sub-base. The two teams must get to the sub-bases and activate their respective chess clock/stopwatch & deactivate the opposing teams clock/stopwatch. At the end of the time limit, the total time that each base was controlled by each team is calculated to determine who ''won'' that base. The team that ''won'' the most bases is declared the overall winner.\nTime Limit : 10 mins per 10 players\nRegen : Any, although with larger groups the Infinite Regen, Multiple Lives and Medic rules are preferred.\nComments: An easy game to play if Chess Timer Clocks are used as they start your own clock and stop the enemies clock at the press of a button. Speed and a balance of offence/defence is required to win.\n \n[B]Capture the flag[/B]\nPlayers: Any number:\nStarting points: Two or more bases.\nObjective: Capture a flag which has been deployed central to all bases, and return it to your base. When the flag is returned to a base, that team scores 1 point and the flag/teams are reset. Play continues until the time limit has been reached and the team with the most points is declared the winner. Players who are shot while carrying the flag must drop in on the ground and proceed to the regen point. They cannot tell their team where the flag is until after they have regen''ed.\nTime Limit : 10 minutes per 10 players.\nRegen : Infinite regen rule applies or Medic Rule.\nComments: This one is all about speed and protecting the flag carrier. \n \n[B]Team Juggernaut[/B]\nPlayers: Any number. 1 Juggernaut for every 10 Assassin players.\nStarting points: The Juggernaut(s) should start central to the play area. Assassins start at random bases throughout the play area. \nObjective: Specially marked anti-Juggernaut Pistols should be placed at random areas on the playfield. The Juggernauts will know the location, but cannot touch the pistols. Assassins need to find these pistols. Juggernauts can be shot with assassins AEG''s but cannot be killed by them. Only the special Anti-Juggernaut pistols can be used to kill a Juggernaut. Assassin players can be shot be the Juggernauts but are allowed to regen. Juggernauts are allowed 500 rounds of ammunition only. Assasins must find and use the Anti-Juggernaut pistols to eliminate all the Juggernauts before the time limit expires.\nTime Limit : 5-10 minutes per Juggernaut.\nRegen : Juggernauts are immune to regular AEG fire but have one life when shot with an Anti-Juggernaut pistol. Assassins have infinite Regen.\nComment: The infamous Juggernaut game from the original HRTA site, revamped for the large number of players that attend regularly. Juggernauts need a high pain threshold or lots of body armour and a good awareness of what is happening around them. Assasins require speed and stealth to find the pistol and avoid the Juggernauts. Full Face Masks, gloves and sheemagh/scarf are highly recommended for Juggernauts.\n \n[B]Scavenger Hunt[/B]\nPlayers: Any number. Two equal teams.\nStarting points: Random bases, preferably on opposite ends of the play field\nObjective: Special and unique items are placed on the playfield. Each item is given a value depending on it''s size and location. Items near player bases have a lower value whereas items in central locations have higher values. Smaller hard to see items & larger hard to move items have higher values. The values should be marked on each item. Players carrying items who are shot must drop the item to the ground before regen''ing. At the end of the time limit, the total value of the items acquired by each team is calculated and the team with the highest score wins.\nTime Limit : 10 minutes\nRegen : Infinite Regen.\nComments: A fast and furious game where players do not necessarily need their AEG''s or may be best using pistols. Speed, some luck and matrix style bb''s dodging ability is the key to success.. Items can be as small as a matchbox or large enough that 2-3 players are required safely move it without risk of injury.\n \n[B]Shortage!![/B]\nPlayers: Any number.\nStarting points: Any number of bases.\nObjective: Each player starts off with 100 bb''s for every 10 opposing players and no more. Additional magazines and refills are not allowed. Bang kills are only allowed whist you still have ammunition. When all players are out of ammo, the number of players left alive on each team is calculated. The team with the most players alive wins. Players with no ammo remaining MUST stay in the play zone.\nTime Limit : None.\nRegen : None\nComments: Every shot counts. Staying alive is important, and yet the enemy must be taken out if your team is to win. Some preparation is required to count bb''s, though a weighing scales can be used or everyone can be allowed a ''money bags'' worth of bb''s.', ''),

(380444, 'Review: Airsoft KnightHawk 1911 Salams, \n\nIn my childhood I used to do a lot of airgun shooting and  hunting. When I turned 18, well ;)\n\nRecently Airsoft products have started to trickle into Pakistan and I went and bought a few yesterday. Since Airsoft guns are relatively new here in Pakistan before I go on I should also say a few words on Airsoft itself. \n\nGenerally most replica weapons shooting plastic BB''s using either compressed gas, batteries or springs as propellant are known as Airsoft guns. There are over 50 different manufacturer''s who produce Airsoft guns. The one I''m reviewing today is the [B]KnightHawk 1911[/B] by WEI-E Tech of Taiwan which sells and makes medium budget Airsoft guns.\n\nThe KnightHawk is a compressed gas 1911 replica. Holding the gun for the first time I was impressed with the attention to detail. The gun looks, feels and weighs just like a normal 1911. In the U.S Airsoft guns generally sold with an colored tip like orange, green etc to help onlookers differentiate them from real guns. The ones sold here are plain. Pictures below:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4585[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4590[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4587[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4588[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4589[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4586[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4584[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4583[/ATTACH]\n\nThe gun comes with a basic how to use manual and a single magazine. The magazine has a dual function, it holds the BB''s (about 15 of them) and also the gas. One fill of compressed gas gets you about 30 shots or two mags worth of shooting.', ''),

I hope it may helpful for some of you.\n\nTarbela Lake is a vast waterfowl, though ducks are not coming as much as few years back, but still a very good qty is migrating there. The place is not far away from Pindi/Isb (one and half hour drive). If one travelling GT road, has to turn left from Hassan Abdal and continue driving on KKH. While reaching Haripur City take left and about 6 km you will be at the waterfowl of Tarbela Lake.\nBut one has to have the KPK valid shooting license. For obtaining KPK license Please contact [B]Mr. Fazl-e-Ahla WL Range Officer[/B] OR [B]Mr. Shoukat (0346-5615137)[/B]. The annual fee of KPK license is 1000 Rs. By submitting them the copy of NIC and a photograph + 1000 Rs.

Probably it means that after using Tibet products, one will become twice as lovely as compared to their current degree of loveliness.

Then the license will be processed and there is always a long Que of applied license. DCO has a certain quota/month of issuance of the license. All other ways including through dealers are illegal and discouraged by the Govt authorities. There are certain cases in which big rackets were captured who were involved in making license. \r\nAlthough, the license made by dealers are not always fake. But the thing is that the route, which is adopted to make the license, is fake. How’s this is possible, that a person give 2 photographs and a ID card copy to the dealer and after 1 or 2 months get the license (Although the license is ok according to the record) but this all practice is done by the clerks and other agents of arms branches. \r\nThere is a fees of making arms license, that was 5200 or 5300Rs 3-4 months back. If someone''s application get allowed for making a license then that person is required to purchase Pakistan Post Tickets and paste it on the back of the form and then resubmit it to the arms branch.

Mangla is under army control and not an incouraging spot as far as duck hunting is concerned until and unless you acquire a military boat to reach a confirm spot.\n \nDuck hunting is not an easy task. You are never confirm the ducks will come in the morning despite having a good shoot previous night. Its time and experience which will led u slowly to the time when things will get easier to some extent but one cannot confirm whats going to happen after dawn.\n \nTry small marshes and small ponds / creeks first and get some fruit out of it. If someone instigating you that you will get a 100 bag he is fooling you certainly. If you are alone try whatever i have said because proper duck hunting needs at least a team of 3-4 person.\n \nOne thing is however available and rampantly working everywhere now, there are numerious people started paid hunting for almost all species. Duck hunting is also at menu e.g. Baloki area is now fully under control of people how earn money by such means. Rs. 5000 per morning shoot approx. Ducks, mojo, hideout everything set for daily hunting under full cover by pwld.\n \nThis is the most easiest task and a good number of duck hunters are hero''s due to this very area.

Don''t know the rest, but this was the feed-back I got.\r\n\r\nI drew it that a different volume of recoiling gasses from a shorter barrel of same design perhaps would cause some cycling issues with respect to timing of the action, or something!!!!!

Will appreciate if someone can guide about good locations near Islamabad and the right time. thanks[/QUOTE]\n\nBro,\n\nYou will be lucky if you find some.Barring a few days of migration in early season and in March.The pollution in the water and urbanization has taken its toll.River Soan used to be a Paradise for ducks and I have many fond memories of duck shoots spanning over four decades.Now this river has turned in to a big sewer.Only place you can hunt is ahead of Chakri down stream or upstream for a few kilometers, where the river still maintains its semblance of being somewhat clean.And that too in early and late season.The locals here are also well equipped and you will find them lurking behind every bush, ready to fire at any thing that flies.They are also past masters in shooting at night where the ducks alight for resting.\n\nTo my knowledge you cant hunt in the Federal capital areas because of security reasons.Shahpur dam well you can try but it is dicey.No harm in trying.You can shoot ducks around the peripheries of Mangla dam which extend into AJK.But local help is required.\n\nAll said and done, as a hunter during the season I cant resist the temptation before dawn of gathering all the duck hunting gear, dumping them into the pick up/ jeep and heading out for the river. If Luck favors we get to fire at a few flights.Get a couple of ducks or none at all. Break fast on the banks in the blind, talk about stuff with your buddies.

You are never confirm the ducks will come in the morning despite having a good shoot previous night. Its time and experience which will led u slowly to the time when things will get easier to some extent but one cannot confirm whats going to happen after dawn.\n \nTry small marshes and small ponds / creeks first and get some fruit out of it. If someone instigating you that you will get a 100 bag he is fooling you certainly. If you are alone try whatever i have said because proper duck hunting needs at least a team of 3-4 person.\n \nOne thing is however available and rampantly working everywhere now, there are numerious people started paid hunting for almost all species. Duck hunting is also at menu e.g. Baloki area is now fully under control of people how earn money by such means. Rs. 5000 per morning shoot approx. Ducks, mojo, hideout everything set for daily hunting under full cover by pwld.\n \nThis is the most easiest task and a good number of duck hunters are hero''s due to this very area.

Me being a humble and less informed user told him NOT to spray this much amount in the barrel and mechanism, so I held the SAME gun, cleaned it with a cloth (the barrel and the mechanism) and fired 10 rounds without an Issue. Verdict: Never spray this much amount of oil in an imported weapon, it is only meant for DESI weapons.. \nSo for all you know, I might be questioning his abilities and information about imported weapons..

(381743, ' having both revolvers and semi auto pistols, i think it boils down to personal preference coupled with PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE with whatever platform one selects.\n\nMy personal experience is as under:\n \nWith a snub nosed .357 magnum revolver, i find it next to impossible to take quick , accurate double-tap type shots with its enormous recoil , muzzle blast and double action trigger.  I keep this as a backup weapon for potential situations that are very up-close-and-personal.\n\nA full load .357 magnum (which actually is a 9mm diameter bullet with loads EXTRA propellant behind it) is a difficult round to master anyway due to its strong kick and large muzzle blast. Also, much as i have practiced, i find accomplishing a smooth/quick ''tactical reload'' nearly an impossibility with it despite having speedloaders.  Interestingly, using single action well aimed shots , i have achieved more accurate shooting with this snubbie than my full sized pistols despite its small barrel.  I attribute this to the very smooth single action trigger.\n\non the other hand my trusty glock 26 is a pleasure to shoot in a small package with additional rounds and easy reload capability. Any other sub-compact should impart the same experience to the user. Much less recoil (due to slide action absorbing some recoil and also the overall more manageable recoil of a 9x19 round).\n\nYou will also find strong proponents on the internet who state that using a .357 magnum round in a 2inch revolver barrel actually defeats the entire purpose of this round as any pistol with a 9x19mm high power round and a  3 inch barrel  would come very close to match the muzzle energy of the .357 mag round fired from a 2 inch barrel.  ( bullets fired from  a longer barrel , upto a limit, would result in higher velocity and higher muzzle energy being delivered by the bullet)\n\nIf you want to use a .357 magnum, then it is advisable to use a longer barrel revolver to benefit from the full potential of a .357 mag.  a .357 magnum fired from  a 4inch+ barrel truly becomes a beast on its own (albeit still with its phenomenal and difficult to control kick and large muzzle blast)\n\nI would strongly recommend beginners to go with a 9mm semi auto pistol rather than a snubbie revolver any day of the week.', ''),

(381752, ' To the already well described description here, i would add that the effectiveness of any bullet is not solely dependent on how quickly it stops and transfers all its kinetic energy into the ''target'' but that is combined with  how big of a hole the bullet makes and how far it travels within the target to cause permanent damage to vitals. \n\nAs an example, if a person is wearing bullet resistant vest with a hard armour plate and is shot with a handgun round. This person would keep standing and would be able to take the full force of the bullet impact fairly well. Even taking a handgun bullet while wearing an appropriate soft vest alone would also not cause grievous damage and most people would walk away with bruising. In both cases the bullet transferred all its energy in an instant to the wearer. So just the bullet energy from a handgun being transferred quickly alone does not cause all the damage.\n\nIt is widely accepted that an effective bullet should be able to consistently penetrate at least 12 inches of flesh. Good quality hollowpoint bullets offer 2x advantage in that they create a WIDER wound channel (as they expand) and they also avoid over-penetration. \nHowever, manufacturers go to lengths to ensure that their bullets DO also penetrate significantly to reach vital organs (so they create deeper and wider wounds).', ''),

(381871, 'Hunting Ethics and the Ethical Hunter  - Article [B][U][CENTER]Hunting Ethics and the Ethical Hunter[/CENTER][/U][/B]\r\n\r\nHunting has two kinds of laws.\r\n\r\nOne is the written law that is enforced by the game warden. The other is unwritten. It is an ethical code or code of honor that the true sportsman places on himself or herself.\r\n\r\nMost hunters obey the game laws, but that alone is not enough.  Without ethics, man or woman can be a licensed, law abiding hunter and still be a poor sportsman. \r\n\r\nThere is nothing illegal about shooting at a running whitetail deer over 600 yards away (with a rifle) or trying to down a bird flying over 100 yards high or shooting an arrow at an animal that is out of his or her effective shooting range.   It is certainly unethical and only a poor sportsman would try it.\r\n\r\nThe ethical hunter knows both the limits of his or her equipment and their shooting ability and always tries for a clean quick kill.  In addition, the ethical hunter obeys all laws when hunting. The hunter acts as a goodwill ambassador for the sport and for all other hunters.\r\n\r\nHe or She knows that the town, where road signs are used for target practice, quickly removes the welcome mat for hunters. And the farmer whose property or livestock are abused will post his land and forbid further hunting.\r\n\r\nA real sportsman does all they can to grow in hunting skills.  If he or she is not a good shot, they will work hard at it and practice all they can. A real sportsman learns all about their quarry. He or she learns all about the range that they hunt.  In other words he/she has respect for their quarry and hunts it in only fair and sporting ways.  As an ethical hunter, a real hunter believes in "fair chase", and never takes unfair advantage of the game being hunted.  This principle of   "fair chase" is often part of the law.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it may not be against the law to shoot a bird on the ground or a duck swimming in the water or a rabbit in hiding, but the ethical hunter will never do that.  \r\n\r\nA person who takes pride in hunting and in themselves being hunters always hunts in such a way that neither he / she nor the game they hunt is ever shamed. The ethical hunter treats game with respect both before and after the shot.\r\n\r\nThat is why the ethical bird hunter, if they can afford to keep one, uses a trained bird dog.  The dog is used not to just find the birds, but to recover them when they are downed.\r\n\r\nThe big game hunter makes every possible effort to avoid wounding game, and if that is the case, all further hunting is stopped until the game is found.  He or She will even abandon hunting to help another hunter find wounded game.\r\n\r\nThe ethical hunter never takes more than the legal limit of game.  But more important, he/she never takes more than they can use.  Game is cleaned quickly and skillfully and brought to the kitchen in prime condition.  It is never wasted and real pride is taken in this because it is a sure sign of the hunter''s skill and knowledge.   It also shows that respect for game is a part of his or her self respect as a seasoned hunter.\r\n\r\nThere are two main kinds of people in this world, the givers and the takers. The ethical hunter is a giver.  The unethical hunter - the poacher, the man or woman who breaks the game laws and sets no standard for his or her conduct as a hunter is a taker.\r\n\r\nIt is the ethical hunter who gives a friend the advantage for getting a good shot and who likes the odds in his hunting slanted in favor of the game hunted.  The ethical hunter takes pleasure in sharing the game that is taken with those whose land was hunted.\r\n\r\nIt is the ethical hunter who is willing to take the time to introduce a youngster to the enjoyment of the hunting experience.\r\n\r\nThe unethical hunter, the taker, never gives anyone an even break.  They are people who brag about their success when a limit is filled or makes excuses when it is not.  They will hunt private property without permission and show no respect for the land on which they trespassed.  The driving force is never the thrill of the hunt, but how much game can be shot.\r\n\r\nWhile even the ethical hunter may never enjoy the full approval of the non-hunting public, the public may at least tolerate them.  And as public awareness of the hunter''s significant role in conservation increases, anti-hunting sentiment may recede.\r\n\r\nWhat type of hunter are you?\r\n\r\n(courtesy:[url]http://home.comcast.net/~gefferts/hunting_ethics.htm[/url])', ''),

There are empty pages in computerized licences for these endorsements.  It is not like Card licence where everytime u purchase or change weapon u need a new card.

There are thus five laser dots and corresponding shots. I need forum expert opinion on my aim, recoil handling, sight adjustment, laser adjustment. Should I be happy with my group?[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks for a nice share.\n\nI think your laser needs either no more adjustment, [I]or at the most[/I], a click or two upwards on the elevation scale.\n\nReason why I''m saying there may be no need for further adjustment is due to shot No. 1. Excellent.\n\nYour shots are generally an inch or or 2 to the lower of the POA. Hence, could be due to a slight jerk downwards at trigger release, or what''s also called flinching/anticipation. \n\nI''m not an expert with shooting diagnosis, so let''s see what the seniors have to say.\n\nYet, just an idea, if you can''t get past this low shooting tendency, how about adjusting the laser elevation an inch higher, so that you''d be pointing an inch higher but still getting the bull??\n\nOverall, I must say, this is pretty impressive. Further efficiency of the laser would be  clear, if you do a group of 5 consecutive shots in rapid. Just shoot again as soon as you find the beam back on the bull, would be pretty interesting to see that sequence.\n\nAlso, kindly share your stance with these shots, were you still aiming naturally, means, checking the beam through the iron sights, or was it purely[I] point shooting [/I]? That''s a new habit one has to adjust to, since checking it through the iron sights kind of offsets the very need of the laser as a whole, lolz!\n\n\nLet''s see more, and the vid above is not working, for your info!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

After reading the threads i decided to buy the cf 98 pistol, as Abbas sir wrote that its best choice for new guners. I visited the market and saw many things but my budget bounded me to hp 77, cf 98, germanica 911, stoeger etc. During my search a local dealer showed me this pistol and asked for Rs. 70k. But it is out of my range so that i ignored it. \n\nYesterday finally i went to markete and visited few dealers near Mall road, lahore. But, when i went to Hira Arms, there i met a retired col. Who had purchased daewoo dp 51 for cc. He recognized me with the reference of my legal advisor Mr. Ali Sibtain Fazli. He strongly recommended me to buy this pistol but i was reluctant due to my budget. He sensed the reson and himself told the owner of the shop to issue this pistol for me and told me, "can u pay Rs 54k for this". I was surprised to listen the price. I immediatly paid the amount and handed over my lisence.\nI have already seen this pistol and liked it.\n\nToday, in the early morning i ve fired 100 rounds.

I went on his car to check if the boars were still there, it was 11pm, and surprisingly I saw like 15 boars munching things from the ground on various spots. I came home, grabbed my RWS 350 magnum .22, took some Gamo Pro Magnum pellets and went to take down my first boar!! To check if my gun was capable of taking one down, I decided not to shoot an adult so I do not injure it, but a small boar. It was a ''teenager boar'', height was a little lesser than till my knees. I shot it from the range of about 7-8 meters, aimed for the head but at the last moment forgot that I didn''t have a torch with me :( . Still shot aiming for the head, pellet went somewhere near the joint of it''s head with neck. As soon as I shot the pellet, the boar screamed and slowly walked further. I knew it was going to die. After some time, found it dead at the roadside with other boars observing the sight. I came home, overcome with joy !!!!!! What a shot!!!

(382456, ' @Junaid 86\n\nIt happens with everyone.There are days when you cant touch a feather.Due to various reasons.Like francolino has very rightly pointed out that swing is of utmost importance and follow through, like in Golf you must follow through smoothly.Your head should not move make it a point to keep it straight and always feel the collar against your neck it will ensure that you are not bending your head forward.That also in some way brings the question of gun fit and design of the gun stock. \n\nThen if your are cramped for space because of wrong  stance, you cant follow through,your feet will be in tangles and result will be a miss,left foot should be slightly ahead of your right foot pointing roughly in the direction of the Partridge to start with.And the opposite for  southpaws. Start the swing from  your waist your weight on your forward foot.Lean into the shot.Aim with your left hand I mean it should be following the partridge roughly.Making it easier for you to bring the gun on the bird.Observe the flight of the bird and move the gun accordingly.Your left hand does the aiming while the right merely brings the gun up to the shoulder.Mostly you will be presented with simple  going away shots, but a crosser is quite a difficult bird to shoot you have to lead  the bird and swing smoothly.  \n\nFor ducks you will have lot of time unlike the partridges, for incoming ducks choose one bird, and try to gather it over  the gun barrel swing past it, I mean the barrel should be a little ahead of the bird. When you feel the distance is right keep the barrel slightly ahead and shoot maintaining the lead and swing through.For crossing ducks left to right or right to left swing with them maintaining lead and shoot don''t forget to follow through.Every one has a different idea of how much lead so you can adopt the one which is giving you good results.\n\nFor Quail same as partridge but you can easily shoot over them and miss above as they tend to fly low skimming the crops or ground, so lean into the shot cover them up completely with your barrel,use a fairly open choke or non at all, no more than improved cylinder and notice the game bag swell.Use # 8 or 9 skeet.\n\n\n\nClays do speed up your reflexes but here you are dealing with something which is constantly loosing velocity, for me it spoils my style of partridge and duck shooting.Face the right direction, Point your feet accordingly, lean into them and shoot maintaining the swing. Even before the clay is released you barrel should be pointing roughly in the right direction, pick them up over the barrel, swing through them and shoot maintaining their line of flight  with your barrel.', ''),

(382460, 'Improving The Performance of Your Airgun [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nA few days ago I noticed that my Airgun''s receiver kinda moves (slight play) inside its polymer furniture. the movement wasn''t enough to be concerned about but as always if moves and it shouldn''t (or if it doesn''t move and it should) I just have to investigate and kill some time and a few million brain cells in the process.\r\n\r\nSo..... after doing some research I came to a conclusion that I should do something about it and eliminating this play might improve the accuracy potential of the airgun. one must understand that those who cant shoot usually satisfy themselves (and their egos) by looking for answers to such problems. ;) Lols! at least I''m honest enough to admit, right?\r\n\r\nAnyways, the research led me to believe that a stiff action inside a rifle stock is highly desired due to the increased accuracy that comes with the lack of play (tight tolerances). however the traditional accurazing techniques of a rifle do not work with airguns. its a totally different animal altogether. then it hit me, how about using something totally simple as a cable tie available at most hardware/automotive stores?\r\n\r\n[B]Something to get out of the way (as always):[/B]\r\n\r\n[B][I]The following content is for informational purposes only.

However I think that RAMI is more suitable for a CC Gun compared to Duty. Even RAMI(not polymer version) is priced @ $585 and Duty @ $467 (difference of $117).\nAnother difference is in Frame: RAMI has light alloy frame and Duty has Polymer.\nIt has been reported that sometime two problems in DUTY found are "Magazine Jam" and "Bulging in Frame" due to polymer fault which sometimes seen in NIB and sometime shown up until the weapon has had a few rounds put through it. I think Duty is the only Gun which subjected to so much controversies since it launch in 2009 and is a way far than other CZs in design.\n\n (refer  [URL]http://www.defensivecarry.com/forum/defensive-carry-guns/121798-cz-p07-duty-xdm-compact.html[/URL] ).

The trick is to make sure that there is minimum play in the components of an Airgun. after that, just float the gun and let it recoil freely. do not let it touch your shoulder while aiming and do not grip the stock with your left hand. just let it float on the palm on your left hand or pillow or a rifle rest. also, lightly (feather light) hold the pistol grip while squeezing the trigger.\r\n\r\nI figure that since these airguns are mostly springers the vibrations play a big part in determining the true accuracy potential. therefore to get max accuracy one must reduce the vibrations as much as possible and those vibrations that cannot be controlled must be left totally free and uninfluenced.\r\n\r\n@Denovo87\r\n\r\nThanks for the heads up bro. after talking to you I did not even think of touching the screws for the fear of breaking the stock. therefore had to resort to alternate means of stiffening the action.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(382617, ' Agree with Ak47.\n\nHowever I do not believe that steel is better than polymer by default. Infact I think that''s nonsense, it''s all about the design of the gun. Some guns are better suited for polymer frames like Glocks for example. The Rami P although not a bad gun turns into a fantastic gun in the Steel/Alloy frame while in Polymer it''s just average. Also CZ gave the P another disadvantage by giving the D Trijicon sights and P regular ones.  \n\nI''ve had both guns for a year and carry the Duty every day and the Rami perhaps a dozen times. It all comes down to your preference. I took some pictures just now to show and tell you why.\n\nHere are both the guns next to each other. The Duty a compact and the Rami a sub compact. I have a Houge on the Duty in this picture.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4934[/ATTACH]\nNext up, notice the Grip width. The Rami with it''s Rubber grips is about half a cm thicker than the Duty.\n\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]4935[/ATTACH]This is the Rami with 14 shot magazine. Isn''t it strange that the Rami grip length is more than the Duty. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4936[/ATTACH]\nThe Rami and the Duty placed side by side to make length comparison easy for you guys. The Duty is about 2 cm longer. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4937[/ATTACH]\n\nFrom the pictures above it should be clear that the Rami ceases to be a sub compact with the 14 shot magazine and is almost into compact territory. Barrel length is not the sole consideration for being a sub compact, frame width, low sights, low weight is very important for a gun that is meant to be primarily carried concealed. \n\nI prefer the Duty to carry over the Rami because:\n\n1). The Duty fits my hand better.\n2). The Duty is as easily carried as the Rami.\n3). The Duty offers me two more rounds for slightly lesser mag size (16 vs 14).\n4). The Duty has a better balance because of the longer frame/barrel.\n5). The Duty has a better trigger. (Rami''s is good, Omega is excellent).\n6). The Duty has a Safety and an option to install a Decocker if I need one. The Rami comes with a decocker. I prefer safeties.\n7). The Duty is easier to shoot on Range days at distances beyond 20m.\n8). The Duty has a much better trigger guard for support hand adding to gun balance.\n9). The Duty has rails for mounting a light or a laser.\n10). The Duty has Ambidextrous controls (i.e the Safety/Decocker is on both sides of the gun)\n\nI have both and really love the little Rami because it is a gun that over delivers on your expectation for a subcompact, to do that though it''s ended up somewhere in between a compact and a sub compact.', ''),

You''re welcome. I truly appreciate such original projects, even did one for a shooting stand recently and I''ve found it of great utility. Hence my deeper interaction with you, so kindly proceed to the next suggestions/questions:\n\n1) Do you use any rubber packing between the cam and the  alu mount??\n \nI trust so. Otherwise that would be suggested, both for better stability as well as for protection of camera body from scratches, etc.\n\n2) Do you feel the mount could get "universalized" for adoption by any sort of digital, handy cameras? If not, then this would be the next thing to work on.\n\n\n3) Does the camera mount have elevation levels, as to adjust to different kinds of scopes, ocular dia''s, angles, or is it custom specific to your scope only, so far?\n\nThis is a unique creation bro and you''d do a great service if these modalities could be worked on as well, if any of these are not already covered.\n\nFinally, I understand your suggestion for adjusting the screen brightness of the camera if need be.\n\nI was just asking how you feel about the camera being too close to the eyes, any visual issues? Coz I trust, there may be hardly some 6 inches from the camera to your eyes.\n\nJust wait till we have a bluetooth camera in the market, lots of possibilities, lolz!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

You can easily achieve 1 inch groups at 40 yards, effective range for pigeons and rabbits is up to 100 yards and recoil is very manageable. Once the rifle is broken in, accuracy is further aided and loudness also decreases to some extent. It is a springer which is an ''air cannon'' and able to take down coyotes, jackals, porcupines, etc in one shot. I myself have shot a large baby wild boar with mine. About scopes, Diana 4-16X42AO and Diana 6-24X42 AO scopes work perfectly alright on this gun and stay zeroed if you use a single-piece lock-down mount. Other scopes which are effective on this gun are Bushnell, Leopold, etc RECOIL AND SHOCK PROOF SCOPES. And if one wants a cheaper method than scopes, he can buy peep sights, just like open sights, very very accurate (about as much as a 4Xmagnification scope).', ''),

It was strange to read a post such as the one below from someone such as yourself. \n\nThere was perhaps some miscommunication, this forum is not Punjab, KPK or any other province specific nor does it follow the hunting or firearms rules of any of province. We have our own set of rules and are clear about what is allowed and what is not. For example automatic weapons in Pakistan are allowed for those who have licenses for them, however our forum rules don''t allow them so don''t discuss them. Similarly bolt action rifles were prohibited in Punjab but allowed in Sindh. Regardless of what the provincial policy in Punjab was we allowed them from the very beginning. This is one thing our hunter brothers fail to understand, we don''t care what the hunting rules are in Punjab, KPK, Sind or Baluchistan, we have our own and act accordingly. \n\nIt is useless to start arguing with a moderator about "why" a rule is what it is.

Hence, could be due to a slight jerk downwards at trigger release, or what''s also called flinching/anticipation. \nI''m not an expert with shooting diagnosis, so let''s see what the seniors have to say.\nYet, just an idea, if you can''t get past this low shooting tendency, how about adjusting the laser elevation an inch higher, so that you''d be pointing an inch higher but still getting the bull??\nOverall, I must say, this is pretty impressive. Further efficiency of the laser would be  clear, if you do a group of 5 consecutive shots in rapid. Just shoot again as soon as you find the beam back on the bull, would be pretty interesting to see that sequence.\nAlso, kindly share your stance with these shots, were you still aiming naturally, means, checking the beam through the iron sights, or was it purely[I] point shooting [/I]? That''s a new habit one has to adjust to, since checking it through the iron sights kind of offsets the very need of the laser as a whole, lolz!\nLet''s see more, and the vid above is not working, for your info!\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\nThanks bro, I really appreciate your advice and time. I solely depended upon the laser for aiming my pistol. I''ll try to adjust laser with sight (I may use a light through barrel for zeroing). Do you think the laser shakes due to the recoil and needs adjustment after every shot? I guess I need another range visit to check if I improve flinching/anticipation (jerk downwards at trigger release).\nWith best wishes\nNaseer', ''),

You''re welcome.\n\nNo, I do not think so, since you''ve a relatively class laser attached to your gun and this would render it useless as such.\n\nI think you should not make any changes to it so far, just visit the range again and try to control your own would-be faults first, like flinching, etc. \n\nIf you still find it out of zero, then change upon anything.\n \nActually, I remember when a fellow bro came over to me to check out his sight-adjustable 608 revolver. It was shooting perfectly fine but he wanted more from it and adjusted a few clicks up/down/left/right only to find it worsening out and we never got it back to stock settings again.\n \nPersonal errors should be corrected first before correction on the gadgets, [COLOR=#ff8c00][I]especially since your laser is already very close to perfect zero[/I].[/COLOR] \n\nAs for the laser boresighter, well, I think it may have been useful for the beginning to get you onto the paper, yet experiment with the adjustment only after another good session.\n\nThis make of laser should be able to hold zero retention, yet i agree, you do have to adjust every time, had it been a Chinese one!!\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Once the rifle is broken in, accuracy is further aided and loudness also decreases to some extent.

(383087, ' Dear mujtabakhan,\n\nAirsoft is used mostly for recreational purposes; there are airsoft clubs, teams and even sports associations devoted to airsoft events around the world.\n\nHowever on a serious note airsoft guns are frequently used to train soldiers and officers in the army and in law enforcement. Airsoft guns are very similar to real guns used by these personnel, and in many cases, the size ratio and even weight ratio is 1:1. Also the devices function very closely to how real guns operate.\n\nOne of the main reasons airsoft guns are so attractive in militaristic simulations is, besides the realism, the simple fact that you can actually use them to fight. All you can do with a real gun is target shoot or at most fire blanks but nothing that comes close to real. Personnel can actually engage in realistic military operations with airsoft guns, and perform maneuvers that they may well do in actual combat. The training is very efficient because of the size and weight ratios and the fact that with the use of the appropriate airsoft guns, the training feels like a real battle.\n\nHope this makes the concept of airsoft guns clearer to you.', ''),

Use some vinegar for better cooking.\n\n\n[B]Now please come forward to share the recipies :-\n[/B][/QUOTE]\nThanks Prince for the good tips. My grandma use to apply lemon,vinigar,garlic crush etc, for the big game meat. Flour (ATTA) is a new recipe. This is normally used on low dense fish meat after lemon application to absorb its water. Since duck meat is very thick, dry and high dense it does not release the water contents so easily.\nIn Japan i have seen the traditional duck cooking where they use smoke of wood fire on the raw duck meat to eliminate its smell. Somewhat similar method is also applied in Pakistan which is locally  called "Luu Kai Pakana". In this process removes the feathers of the duck while leaving the skin and feather filaments intact. Clean the duck thoroughly and burn the feather filaments with wood fire until the skin becomes brownish. Now remove the chest bone and cut the duck into pieces. Tender these pieces in Garlic paste, Oil, Little yogurt, a small cube of cheese, salt, pepper and spices according to the taste. (No onion ). Once it properly cooked remove the skin while eating and enjoy a great taste of duck.\nHowever I enjoyed Steak of my hunting birds and animals. Marinade the completely clean and washed 1/2 kg meat with 2 table spoon of oil, 2 table spoon of water. 1 table spoon of red wine vinegar and 2 table spoon of Steak seasoning. Put marinade meat in refrigerator for 1 hour. Discard marinade. You may grill the stuff or wrap a foil paper and put it in oven for 30 minutes. Try it and enjoy. Last Sunday I did the same with Spotbill.', ''),

I have heard of the .30 bore (7.62x25mm) rounds achieve between 1300 -1450 fps but with a 85 grain bullet. The .357 magnum round (7.62x33mm) has almost the same diameter as the .30 bore bullet, but has a longer cartridge (more powder) behind it resulting it far higher velocities from heavier bullets. For example the .357 mag bullet having 158grain bullet achieves 1485 fps. Hence the .357 can weigh almost twice as much and still have the same velocity as  the TT bullet, which should impart considerably more damage to the target.\n\nI am learning new things everyday and would appreciate the reference? thanks', ''),

(383235, 'Arabic Inscription on Bosnian Rifle Buttstock - Translation? Hi guys.  I figured of all my forums that I subscribe to, this is the one that has the best chance of having someone who can read Arabic, so here it is.\n\nOne of the UN conditions that the former-Yugoslavian countries (Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia) signed up for in their peace agreements was that they would disarm their militias and paramilitaries, and reduce the number of weapons in their national armories.  These weapons were stored for awhile, and now they are being destroyed by cutting the receiver in half.  The parts from these destroyed guns go onto the world market, many of which come to the USA.  \n\nSome of these parts have been modified and personalized by individuals who used them.  I assume this was probably done by militia/paramilitaries and civilians, as it is hard to imagine the officers of a regular military force permitting this.   In any case, it was very common to carve the buttstocks and grips in ways ranging from crude graffiti to elaborate national crests and slogans or nice portraits of wives and girlfriends, etc.  Pretty much whatever a bored soldier without good supervision would want to do.\n\nSo here is what I have, presumably made by a Muslim militiaman fighting for Bosnia (either a native Bosnian or foreign volunteer).

I have heard of the .30 bore (7.62x25mm) rounds achieve between 1300 -1450 fps but with a 85 grain bullet. The .357 magnum round (7.62x33mm) has almost the same diameter as the .30 bore bullet, but has a longer cartridge (more powder) behind it resulting it far higher velocities from heavier bullets. For example the .357 mag bullet having 158grain bullet achieves 1485 fps. Hence the .357 can weigh almost twice as much and still have the same velocity as  the TT bullet, which should impact considerably more damage to the target.\n\nI am learning new things everyday and would appreciate the reference? thanks[/QUOTE] Defining power of a cartridge is very difficult. Some judge by the  bullets diameter, others bullet  velocity,still others by  energy derived for bullet diameter  and velocity factors combined. For myself, I have compromised on all these factors. I use the 9mm, not because it is the most powerful, but because it has sufficent bullet diameter, velocity, and energy to stop an opponent with muliple hits.I chose it  because I wish to reduce the chance of killing an innocent bystander, reduce the change of over penetration(and again killing an innocent),and because hanguns are available in sizes ease to conceal.I will close the a quote from and older wise man."The only use for a handgun is to fight your way to a rifle"', ''),

(383321, 'Battle of Handgun bullets/cartridges-Muzzle energy comparision of various calibers Here is a very interesting and informative compilation of graphs documenting muzzle energies of various handgun calibers  / bullets/ cartridges and comparing them with barrel length from which they are fired. An excellent  compendium of various handgun caliber bullets'' performances. For example a  9mm luger delivers more energy when fired from a 3 inch barrel than a .38 special bullet out of a 2inch snubbie (so a CZ RAMI with its 3 inch barrel may be a more effective man stopper with less recoil, more shots and less muzzle blast than with a 2 inch  barreled S&W J frame revolver firing .38 special cartridges/bullets) ).  This also shows that using a .357 magnum in a 2inch revolver may deliver as much punch as when using a 9mm luger from a 3-4 inch barrel [but with the 9mm luger you also get a lot more control-ability and more shots].  .357 magnums start shining when fired from 3inch+ barrels. I certainly learnt a lot from this and MAY be switching from my .357 mag snubbie to a CZ RAMI as a backup handgun. Hope you all enjoy it as much as i did.

While a smaller diameter barrel COULD be made into a larger diameter , such as when you converted it to 8mm which is 0.31 inches ,  you cannot go back to a 30.06 (0.306 inches) from  8mm (0.31 inches - 0.33 inches) [you cannot make a hole less small). Hence , unfortunately i doubt that  you can make a the barrel diameter smaller to accept 30.06 bullets. \n\nAlso, since you did not mention WHICH 8mm caliber the rifle was converted to, the gunsmith doing the conversion would have also changed the dimensions of the rifle chamber.\n\nYou COULD technically use 30.06 bullets in your 8mm rifle but this would require quite a complex technique and hand loading the 30.06 bullets in a cartridge designed for  your 8mm bullets and using SABOTS.

I would have thought the muzzle energy is equal or perhaps slight higher for heavier grains and not less as is shown in the graph (since energy is a measure of force that is independent of weight).[/QUOTE]\n\n@ Alisyed: Bro, a very valid and interesting observation which i shall answer in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1: Muzzle energy is actually the Kinetic energy of the bullet as calculated right when the bullet exits the muzzle. Kinetic energy: E=Mass x velocity x velocity. \nSo muzzle energy  calculations DO  take into account   the mass of the bullet and its velocity.  Since we are measuring energy in ft - pounds the formula is as under:\n\n[TABLE="width: 700"]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]         [CENTER][B]muzzle energy:[/B]\n[/CENTER]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         [CENTER][B][U]Velocity * Velocity (ft/sec) * Bullet Mass (grains)[/U] =           ft. lbs.\n 450,240 [/B]                    \n                       \n        (velocity in feet per second, weight in grains.)\n\nThe number 450,240 is a constant needed to convert the units. If someone is curious as to why this number is used, i have put in the calculation at the bottom. We are using grains and velocity in ft/sec as these figures are easier to come by. We are using pounds since the cited graphs have their energies measured in ft-pounds.\n[/CENTER]\n[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (Velocity squared. I can''t figure out how to put up a ''squared'' in here so i put in velocity  * velocity )\n\nPlease[FONT=Arial] note that it is obvious from the above formula that in developing muzzle energy, muzzle velocity is much more important than projectile weight. Doubling the muzzle velocity of a  projectile quadruples its energy, whereas doubling the projectile weight only doubles its energy.[/FONT] If the  mass of the bullet being shot is increased and its velocity is not kept the same or is decreased there will a bigger drop in the muzzle energy in proportion to the drop in velocity. \n\nIdeally, if when the bullet mass increases and the velocity could be kept constant or the velocity drop is kept at a minimum, it would result in far more muzzle energy delivered by the bullet compared to that delivered by  a lighter bullet with the same velocity.\n\nExample:  \n a .357 magnum bullet of 125 grains mass and achieving a muzzle velocity of 1000 ft/s from a 2 inch barrel  would generate around 277 ft.pound of muzzle energy\n[B][U]1000 * 1000 * 125[/U]  = 277.62        ft. lbs.\n 450,240 [/B]                    \n\na .357 magnum bullet of 158 grains mass and achieving a muzzle velocity  of 1000 ft/s from a 2 inch barrel  would generate around 350 ft.pound of  muzzle energy\n[B][U]1000 * 1000 * 158[/U]  =   350.92        ft. lbs.\n 450,240 [/B]                    \n\nIn this case the heavier bullet DOES impart phenomenally more muzzle energy than its lighter counterpart (velocity remained constant) and your observation holds completely true.\n\n\nPart 2: How to explain the phenomenon that you noticed wherein  a heavier bullet in 9mm luger is showing considerably less muzzle energy than a lighter bullet (example Corbon 90 grain  JHP +P  vs Federal  135 gr Hydra Shok JHP Low recoil).\n\nThe answer lies in their muzzle velocities. The 90 grain bullet is rated +P which means that bullet''s  cartridge is loaded HOTTER to achieve higher velocities than normal for the bullet. Fired from a 2 inch barrel it achieved a velocity of 1215 ft/sec.  The  135 gr Bullet is marked "LOW RECOIL" indicating that it is loaded for lower recoil and hence would achieve lesser velocities (since the mass of the bullet is fixed and is larger than the 90 grain bullet, it would mean that the powder used was of such quality or quantity that it imparts lower velocity to the bullet- hence lower recoil felt by the shooter). This bullet achieves a velocity of 909 ft/second only. Difference in velocities= 306 ft/sec. ( the 90 grain bullet is faster by 33% than the 135 grain bullet).\n\nThe large difference in velocities of these two rounds tilt the scale of muzzle energy in favour of the  the lighter bullet, as reflected in the graph for 9mm below.\n\nHowever, when you compare the Corbon 115 grain +P, the muzzle energy delivered is far higher than those delivered by the the 90 grain +p bullet. \n\nThis is because the 115 grain +P bullet (being ALSO loaded hot) achieves a velocity of 1134 ft/second. Now the difference in velocities is  narrower between the two bullets (1215-1134= 81 ft/second) but it is enough to give the heavier bullet a slightly more muzzle velocity (The difference in mass between the two bullets is far more than the difference in velocities .  The 115 grain bullet is 27.7% heavier than the 90 grain bullet but the 90 grain bullet is only 7% faster than the heavier 115 gr bullet). \n\nIf you look at the graph for the 9mm luger closely you would see that in fact all heavier bullets that are rated ''+P'' (faster) achieve a higher muzzle energy for their given weight when compared to their ''non +P'' rated (slower) equal weighing counterparts. The +P rated heavier bullets are delivering more muzzle energy than slightly faster but lighter bullets as the mass gain in all of them are much higher and the loss in velocities is quite low. \n\nI hope this issue is a little bit more clear. \n\nBut please do bear in mind that calculation of muzzle energies is just ONE variable in measuring the bullet''s effectiveness in self defence situations and the bullet''s performance/effectiveness also largely depends on its structure/shape, its effectiveness at expansion, its ability not to break up or not to break up prematurely, and on its ability to  achieve consistent deep enough penetration to reach and damage vital organs.\n\nNotes: Part 1: velocities of bullets used in Part 1 are hypothetical for  use as an illustration\n          Part 2 : Velocities of 9mm luger stated are actual recorded and correspond to the graph below.\n\n (Source for velocities : BBTI    [URL]http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/9mmluger.html[/URL])\n\nThat constant  number 450240 is a constant created by  multiplying two times the acceleration of gravity by 7,000 - the number  of grains in a pound. The number I am using for the acceleration of  gravity is 32.16 f.p.s. Apologies for using non-metric figures, but converting them all to metric would require re-doing the graphs units manually and would take too much time to make)', ''),

(383460, ' [QUOTE=AirSoft;221598]Dear mujtabakhan,\r\n\r\nAirsoft is used mostly for recreational purposes; there are airsoft clubs, teams and even sports associations devoted to airsoft events around the world.\r\n\r\nHowever on a serious note airsoft guns are frequently used to train soldiers and officers in the army and in law enforcement. Airsoft guns are very similar to real guns used by these personnel, and in many cases, the size ratio and even weight ratio is 1:1. Also the devices function very closely to how real guns operate.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons airsoft guns are so attractive in militaristic simulations is, besides the realism, the simple fact that you can actually use them to fight. All you can do with a real gun is target shoot or at most fire blanks but nothing that comes close to real. Personnel can actually engage in realistic military operations with airsoft guns, and perform maneuvers that they may well do in actual combat. The training is very efficient because of the size and weight ratios and the fact that with the use of the appropriate airsoft guns, the training feels like a real battle.\r\n\r\nHope this makes the concept of airsoft guns clearer to you.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThank you very much for this detailed explanation. :)\r\nI have one more question, Can Airsoft Gun be used in Bird hunting ???', ''),

(383538, 'FYI: Hunting Section Might be Closing Soon. Salams, \n\nThe Hunting section is a small part of PakGuns which we have for our Hunter brothers. It is a FREE of COST platform for Hunters all over Pakistan and the world to gather to share their stories, pictures and experiences.\n\n We here at PakGuns have provided unparalleled freedom of discussion with easy to follow rules and polite and mild warnings in case of offenses. However some friends have started to think of this facility as a [B]Right [/B]by arguing with moderators, posting content which is against our rules, trying to bend the rules and thinking themselves VIP''s. Moderators start receiving calls, SMS''s and emails soon after a post or a thread which is deemed inappropriate is deleted. I find this behavior very strange, this is an online forum and concerns should be shared via email not by calling people''s personal/work phones. Also not everything everyone shares or posts is something which we would want to keep on fourms. If moderators delete any post or content then that is solely their choice and decision and I stand by it [B]100 %[/B]. No one has the right to question them except Admin.\n\nThe Hunting forum and PakGuns in general is a [B]Privilege [/B]that we provide without any compensation or expectations of return as a goodwill gesture to our Pakistani brothers. We run it the way we deem appropriate, this forum is not a democracy nor do we vote on who gets to be a moderator or not. Admin chooses the best person for the job and then supports and stands by his actions. If Admin over the long run thinks a moderator is not upto the job then it is a matter of personal discussion between the Mod and Admin who are often close friends. I was surprised to learn that people from the Hunting section were calling moderators over the phone and asking for explanations as to why their threads/posts/content were deleted. \n\nAlso to our amusement, two members would both have a quibble in the forums, both would report each other posts saying mean things about the other and demanding that he be banned. If a moderator thought someone was at fault and banned one of them, the other would start asking in the open forum as to why the other was banned and he should be unbanned and brought back to the forum. This reminds me of a John Travolta / Nicolas Cage movie but translated into Urdu the word would be ''Munafkat''. \n\nIn short, some friends from this section have caused us more headaches in a month then the entire forum put together in 6 months. We are strongly considering closing the Hunting section altogether and withdrawing this free platform we provide to hunters. The only reason we haven''t done it already is that there are quite a few genuine hunting members that would lose this facility because of a few''s childish behavior.', ''),

So decided to get myself a .22lr rifle and i am enjoying it as hell. The ammo is cheap, the bang is low, and with using RWS subsonic bullets its no more than a spring airgun and there isn''t any recoil at all. In result that adds the benefit of even installing the most menial scope with menial mounts and still you will be getting great results at 100yds. As the rains struck sindh this monsoon, water-fowling has become very difficult if not impossible. But again if one has a .22lr at hand one can always go for water fowling without even stepping in the water. Though i have been searching myself for a decent riflescope but haven''t succeeded yet. I have CZ 452 standard, and installed a BSA Sweet rifle scope 3-9x40mm. I shot a stray dog from about 50 yards under its ear and the dog fell in its tracks. We have already discussed alot about .22lr''s lethality but as I have used the caliber i have learned that the prime thing is the shot placement without which one will never be able to drop any game in its track. I have more to share as well regarding this beautiful rifle and the caliber that i will share later, for the time being it would be an honor to read about the experience of fellow members with this caliber and rifle.', ''),

(383576, 'Airsoft G36c Short Review. Aoa, \r\ni have always been fascinated by air-soft for one reason or the other. Most mid-high end Air-soft weapons are carefully crafted replicas of the original gun. Like paintball they have a significant potential for fun game play which a little more added realism. So when i heard of air-soft guns being imported , it got be excited, and i ended up buying a G36c Asia electric AEG ( automatic electric gun ).\r\n\r\nFirst Impression :\r\nHaving never held a proper G36c i cant comment on how realistic the feel may or may not be , but the textured abs plastic body is very impressive, compared to the polymer frames of some handguns my family owns. The only thing I''m not a huge fan of is the very ''plastic'' grip.It came with the manual which is pretty much just like Tokyo Marui''s. It even talks about the TM tracer unit. Also included is an 8.4v battery, more on that later a trickle type wall charger, cleaning rod, magazine, and the gun.\r\nStarting with the back of the gun , A decent strength butt-stock, Foldable with a removable rubber butt plate. \r\nThe following are all metal on the G36C: Front sling post, hand guard rail, flash hider, hop-up cover, trigger, selector switch, front and rear sights, all the body and stock pins, and the gearbox. The gun is flat black but when held up to the light it has an amber-ish glow. Metal rear sight, adjustable, and two sights for cqb/field targets. Ambidextrous selector switch. After reaching home i popped bb''s into the mag, and stepped outside,then quickly took aim at my favorite target and let off a quick burst. The rounds took flight and went straight into orbit. After adjusting the hop-up, which is stiff at first, I was consistently hitting a 3 foot tall tree stump at 150 feet. Not bad for a gun that is only 28 and a quarter inches long.\r\n\r\nManual:\r\nThe manual actually surprised me. It didn''t have many spelling mistakes and was easy to read, almost no engrish. It had a lot of diagrams for the breakdown of the gun, cleaning the barrel, even trouble shooting. A good manual is a plus in my book.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\nThis thing shoots quite far, I am consistently hitting a tree trunk from 150 feet. I did a poor mans chrono test with a Diet Coke (with Lime) and it went straight through both sides. I also shot the bottom and it pierced it (didn''t go in). But that is quite impressive. \r\n\r\nInternals:\r\nI haven''t cracked open the gearbox mainly because I just got it and I wont jack with it till it breaks or I want to upgrade it. The hop-up is very responsive and is adjusted via the G36 dial.\r\nJudging by the sound of the gun, there isn''t any gear grind or weird sounds so I think this thing will last, time will tell. I haven''t had any semi auto lock ups, where you have to switch into auto to be able to fire.The battery that comes with the gun is very nice and fits solidly into the hand guard.\r\n\r\nDurability:\r\nCant say yet, but trust me this gun is going to have the crap beat out of it and we''ll see how long it lasts. Judging by how smooth the GB is running I think it will last, but only time will tell. I have shot about 1500 rounds through this gun, with not 1 miss-feed, jam, or lock up. Its done its job so far, not only internally, but externally as well.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nIn the limited time I''ve owned this gun , it''s managed to bring a smile to my face each time . Watching a cardboard box getting shred to pieces on full auto is just plainly put ....Satisfying :P  \r\nAir-soft guns aren''t meant to be compared to Airguns, their primary application is for fun and sport\r\nI would like to thank Imran bhai for being a super host/salesperson/tech-help all rolled in one .\r\nThis is airsoft !

If anyone asks what happened to their post without any comment just post a link to this thread: ( [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?7457-New-Hunting-Section-Rules.-Please-follow-to-avoid-Inconvenience.&p=222704#post222704[/url] )\n\n2). [B]Moderators should avoid posting comments in the Hunting threads[/B]. If you appreciate them they will think you are their best buddy and they can get away with stuff, if you object to them they will start to think they are being victimized. \n\n3). [B]Completely Avoid communication with Hunters over the phone/sms[/B] or in person except GTG''s. They can never be friends with Mods.\n\n4). [B]Warnings are sent over email only[/B] to Hunters and not in the main forum. Any warning in the main forum is like a head shot to their ego''s. \n\n5). [B]Never, ever, Never NEVER get personal[/B] with Hunters or ask them about laws and regulations and to explain their viewpoint. They will always tell you an interpretation of the law with suits them. It is pointless arguing. Any warning should be [B]soft[/B], [B]professional [/B]and [B]business [/B]like. \n\n6). If someone is rude to you, do not get angry, the man responsible is not worth spoiling your mood over. If the rude comment is mild then you can ignore it by deleting his post and pretending you never read it.

I want to share some of the draw backs of Diana 54 airking.  Its a costly gun and I feel that all should know the negative points of this gun before going into purchase it.  \n\nPlease note that I mention these points with complete confidence and surety.\n\n1.  Its heavy for some one who wants to shoot it from standing position.\n\n2.  Its very accurate but to find all the potential accuracy you would have to scope it.  And this is the most difficult thing to do. This gun is hardest on scopes.  Even most of the airgun rated scopes do not last long on it. Many Leupolds fail.  It is recoil less to the shooter but has the heaviest recoil on scope.\n\n3.  The recoil on scope is even greater than Webley Patriot.\n\n4.  Even costly scopes fail after a few hundred or few thousand shots.\n\n5.  This gun and 48/52/56TH have the shortest spring lives among all Diana airguns.  The average spring life is 4000 shots.  Some last for just 1000 and some last for 7000 thousand.  So when you buy this gun, be ready to acquire an extra spring.\n\n6.  The best accuracy with this gun is in bench rest position. When you take a sharp angle, you would have to adjust the power of recoil less system.\n\n7.  There is a sleeve of metal on the barrel. This sleeve needs to be kept tight. But some times it becomes loose which creates problem with accuracy.\n\n8.  Peep Sight is the only best option for longer range targets.  Sadly most of us in Pakistan dont use Peeps.\n\nI hope this much will help.  I am always here to give as much information to all as I can.\n\nRegards,', ''),

That is not the case with a snap cap, and hence your logic of ''geometrically and mechanically disturbed'' is disturbing.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a snap cap is to safe guard the firing pin, period! A firing ping is forced to stay within its operational specs when a bullet is present since its motion is stopped by the primer. In a dry fire without a snap cap, the firing pin may come to a stop because of opposing forces on the firing pin spring or by exerting pressure on other areas not designed for it. That said, modern semi''s typically do not need it but precaution is always good. Rimfires and older guns should always be used with snapcap for firing.\r\n\r\n@trajan - PLEASE PLEASE do something about the color - use a marker if need be to make red. It might save someones life one day. Even a small source of confusion of live vs dummy round ammo is too great a risk. \r\n\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Wolf Hunter;219707]When we talk of dry firing we must keep this in mind that we are not doing justice to our weapons.Well I ''ll define it for my brothers that while dry firing when triggers is pressed then only the hammer works and only trigger mechanisim functions where as slides does not move.Now you see you deprive your gun ( by a dry fire) from its natural mechanical move and only trigger, hammer, firing pin and firing pin spring start getting worn out leaving the slide , slide spring and ejector untouched/un moved so the proportion of weapon is physicaly, geometrically and mechanically disturbed.So dry firing if not avoided should be kept least minimum.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Read my original post and it will answer your queries about democrazy. \n\nI personally would not like to close the Hunting section but at the same time I will not let one section spoil the friendly, sincere and brotherly atmosphere of the forum that we''ve worked so hard to build. If the Hunting section is to continue then we''ll have have to redefine our rules and to have extremely strict enforcement in this section. \n\nQuite a few members can understand the delicate situation of the Hunting forums, why don''t friends put yourself in my shoes for a moment and send me your suggestions on if we were to continue with the Hunting section what new Rules should we have ? Any suggestions must meet the following criteria:\n\n1). They should not be controversial. i.e Benefit friends from one province and cripple another.  \n2). They should be sport and conservation promoting.\n3). Posting pictures of hunts of which species should be banned at PakGuns ?\n4). They should be written keeping in mind not to clash with the ''big sins'' of WLD. \n5). They should encourage hunting as a sport and not as a meat collecting exercise.\n6).

Before announcing serious "conseqences" to be met by the license holders, how about the minister announces some "consequences" for his staff at MOI for any flaws, if any incompetency found???!!!!\n\nPeople who would visit Nadra for a re-validation course would do this in the best of beliefs of holding genuine docs, with duly paid revenues to the govt. accounts and having followed/obeyed all respective rules with respect to the acquisition of the weapon and it''s consequent registration.\n\n Hence, even if some unlucky soul should find his docs tempered with or not duly record kept at the MOI, yet holding photocopies of receipts of paid govt. fees, demand notes, etc and duly followed consequent registration of his arms at the concerned quarters, DCO, Police station, etc, one could have expected from the minister a bit more lenient tones towards the license holders who acted and would still act in the best of faith and beliefs when consulting the Nadra offices for re-validations.\n\n [COLOR=#0000cd]In fact, there should have been a "[/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000]grace period[/COLOR][COLOR=#0000CD]" announced for those voluntarily coming to present their believed original docs.[/COLOR]\n\nI truly hope the lawyers highlight these things and manage putting the responsibility of any such record keeping misconducts at the MOI onto those who mismanaged their public office status, rather than victimizing the civilian , who cannot by any way interfere with the internal working of the MOI.\n\nI can see quite a heavy percentage chance for the writs to enforce upon the Nadra and the MOI a [I]re-structered revaildation process[/I].\n\nTwo thumbs up for the writ above, and thanks Umer1976 bro for the brief up.\n\n\nBest of luck.\n\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(383817, 'Review and Field Test: Saiga 12C Exp-01 And Martin Luther King said "I have a dream" and then he took out his Saiga 12 and said "This is it". ;)\n\nThe Saiga 12 is one of the most fun, practical and reliable shotguns I have ever come across. It is the be all and end all of  your Home and Self defense needs and the sheer firepower it puts out is enough to put the fear of God into any opponent. The version I was looking for was the 12C (K) Exp-01 with the year of manufacture of 2010. My specific demands were met when a dealer friend sent me an email saying he had one and I picked it up instantly. \n\nThe Exp-01 comes with a side folding stock and my version is the Model 16 which comes with a windage adjustable leaf sight. There are over 25 variations of the Saiga 12 which are mostly the same thing with minor differences. i.e some will have a full length fixed stock, some will have rifle sights, some with wood furniture etc. \n\nThe build quality of the gun is exceptional. This gun is built to last and to be used in all weather conditions. The weight is very reasonable at around 7.7 pounds (3.5 kg) and the barrel length is 17 inches. My gun came with two magazines, one with a mag cap of 8 cartridges and the other of 5. The fore-end (front grip) is made out of hard plastic and quite comfortable to hold, the pistol grip is also more comfortable to hold and shoot than your normal AK grip. \n\nMake no mistake about it, this is not your run of the mill shotgun. It is a high quality Russian made semi auto AK-47 chambered in 12guage. It is also probably the most powerful mass market NPB weapon that you can buy in Pakistan. \n\nSome pictures:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5112[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5113[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5114[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5115[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5116[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5117[/ATTACH]\n\nRange Report and more to follow tonight.

The droop in every Diana gun is of different degree. RWS has developed the one piece mount with a thumb rule that certain models of Diana guns will have certain barrel droop but it is not the perfect rule for Diana guns.  The mount which I have suggested is also well praised in USA.  I think Beeman company sells this mount under their name.  The quality of Sportsmatch AOP 55 mount is that it is adjustable.  What ever be the barrel droop, it will adjust. In some of the guns there are problem of misaligned scope rail, but this mount also adjusts it.\n\nI think this much will help you decide.', ''),

(383886, ' @PakiPower, Denovo, Ak47, Dr. Farhan, S.Cheema, Abbas Durrani, Wolf  Hunter, Trajan, Zeeshan Malik, Mohammad, Crazy Shooter, WasifAli89, Ameer  Thank you. Review continues below.\n\nThe gun came packed in moisture absorbing paper in a cardboard box. The picture below shows what was included with the gun. An English language manual and a certificate of fitness was also there.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5119[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5120[/ATTACH]\n\nDisassembling the gun, I found it to be bone dry. There was not even a single drop of oil or grease even on the springs or rails. The gun has a gas tube setting, 1 for heavy/magnum loads and 2 for light skeet loads. By default my gun was at the 2 setting. So if I had fired it out of the box (without greasing/oiling and resetting the gas tube to 1) it probably would have destroyed the gun in under two boxes of ammo. Also if the boxes I was shooting were heavy loads, the gun would have given me quite a few cycling issues and much heavier recoil. So I oiled the springs and greased the rails, I also set the gas tube to setting 1 with the help of an included tool (which btw I forgot to add to the picture above).  \n\nAs the gun is an AK, I thought you guys would find it more interesting if I posted the pictures of the internals after shooting a couple of boxes though it. Ak''s have much looser tolerances and are meant to foul up less hence never jam on account of fouling. The following pictures were taken with an 18 megapixel DSLR to really try and catch the grime. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5127[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5126[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5125[/ATTACH]\nThe Gas Tube Setting:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5124[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5128[/ATTACH]\nAfter light / quick cleaning:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5129[/ATTACH]\nAmazing right ? Atleast 7 boxes of ammo were shot though it of various different loads and the fouling was next to nothing. The little bit that you see in the second picture was mostly the grease I had applied to the rails. Also as you can see from the pictures above, the internals are the exact same desgin as the Ak47. \n\nComing up: Field Testing and Video''s.', ''),

(383926, ' On to the range review !\n\nDenovo and Avais had invited us over to Sialkot and we thought what can be a better opportunity to field test the Saiga. 7 different shooters, 5 different kinds of ammo and the Mercedes of Combat shotguns the Bellini M4 to compare with. \n\nI was a bit hesitant before shooting the Saiga for the first time, the 17 inch barrel with no recoil pad didn''t sound like a pleasant shooting situation to me. I fired off the first round and was surprised, the recoil was much lesser than on shotguns with fancy recoil pads. The gun also has natural point-ability and the SG shot was a ho hum affair for it. It wanted more, [I]lots more[/I]. We started off with shooting Shaheen SG/LG''s at 15 meters. After one mag, the target was toast. The below target picture was taken after two mags and a couple of 12G''s home made slugs though it. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5133[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5136[/ATTACH]\nShooting the Saiga is pure unadulterated [B]100 %[/B] Prime entertainment and fun. It is just so addictive and easy to shoot that once you start shooting it''s hard to stop. In less than a minute we had shot our first box of SG''s though it without a thought. The sights are simple and easy since this is a point and shoot weapon. The trigger is crisp and precise, the bolt action flawless and the muzzle flip/recoil extremely manageable. \n\nThe rate of fire of this gun is just jaw dropping, after putting just one box of ammo though it, I was able to shoot an incredible 6 rounds of SG/LG''s in [B]one[/B] second !! The fully automatic and fearsome USAS 12/AA-12''s shoot 5/6 rounds per second !!\n\nWe moved back to 50 meters and started shooting the homemade slugs, our sights were off but at 50 meters the grouping was quite decent. We did have some trouble getting loaded magazines inserted and locking the bolt back but I did a tutorial video about it today and after watching it no one should have any problems. A few more pictures.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5134[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5135[/ATTACH]\nLooking at this picture, does it look like 12g wants one ?? ;)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5137[/ATTACH]\nWe shot a total of around 150 rounds though the gun of various types like home made slugs, Shaheen #4, Shaheen #6, Shaheen #7, Shaheen SG/LG, Federal hollow point Slugs. All shot flawless. At no point did I readjust the gas port setting back to light loads. All shot reliably without malfunction of any kind on setting #1. I tried my best to make the gun FTE but no matter how loose I kept my grip, how loosely I kept the butt stock on my shoulder it worked every time. I also threw the gun around a bit and planned to do a mud/water test but the horrified expressions I saw on 12g''s, Stigma and Starfish''s faces I thought better not to. ;)\n\n[B][U]The Firepower of the Saiga 12.[/U][/B]\n\nAlthough we don''t allow any automatic / P.B weapon discussion here at PakGuns, since this design is so similar to the most successful combat firearm ever made I have to say a few words on the firepower comparison between the two. \n\nOne magazine of the Ak47 holds 30 rounds compared to the Saiga''s 8 cartridges. The 30 bullets mean 30 independent projectiles available for shooting, with the Saiga''s 8 cartridges of SG/LG, you have 9 projectiles per round times 8, making 72 projectiles at your disposal. The Ak47 has a rate of fire of approximately [B]10[/B] rounds per second. I was able to shoot [B]6 SG/LG''s[/B] in the same time. 6 SG/LG''s mean an incredible [B]54[/B] projectiles per second !!\n\nAlso the Ak is a combat rifle and the long range and automatic fire is useless and even dangerous for civilians who at the most require firearms for self / home defense. The Saiga in my opinion is a much more powerful weapon for self/home defense which under extreme circumstances is still always less than 50 meters. The added versatility of the 12guage rounds and the variety of cartridges available make it much more practical. For example I would load a #4 as a first round in my magazine followed by 2 SG/LG''s followed by another #4. If I hear a noise outside my home, in my lawn for example, I would see which general direction the noise is coming from and if I deem it a threat, I would point in that direction and shoot. The #4 pellets would spread to cover a larger area and have a higher probability of hitting anything there. Even if I score a direct hit the damage would not be enough to kill a human being and give him an opportunity to escape. If he attacks instead then the 2 SG/LG''s would take care of any unfinished business. \n\n[U][B]Conclusion[/B][/U]: If you have self/home defense needs and are looking for a reliable auto loading shotgun, you cannot do better than the Saiga in Pakistan.

(384005, ' @Afzaal\nFlinching occurs because we either unconsciously flinch when anticipating the gun''s recoil, or pull the trigger using a knuckle instead of the pad of the finger (normally the the last digit or the finger).\n\nTo see if you''re flinching or not, do the following dry fire exercise:-\n1)  Make sure your gun is empty (check mag well & chamber)\n2)  Place and balance an empty round casing on the front sight\n3)  Take aim at a point on front of you\n4)  Now pull the trigger\n\nIf you flinch even a little, the casing will topple and fall down. If it does, that means you flinch, so continue practicing like this till you get it right. A VERY simple exercise to fix flinching (if any).\n\nSecond, you mentioned that pull to the left when you break your shot. That happens because your finger isn''t sitting properly on the trigger. You should use the pad of the last digit of your trigger finger (the center part of the finger between the last joint and the finger tip). You should NEVER use your knuckle or joint to pull the trigger. The reason for this is that our hands actually don''t have any muscles; in order to move our fingers we actually use muscles in our wrist and forearm. Therefore the idea is to minimize the number of muscles involved when pulling the trigger so as not to cause what is known as a "muscle stagger" (when more than one muscle is involved in doing a particular task, their collective strength is added and the applied force gets multiplied). So, in order to use as few muscles as possible in order to avoid the muscle stagger (and keep the gun as steady as possible), use the pad of your finger; that way you use only the tip of your finger (and therefore only one muscle in the forearm instead of multiple muscles if you use a joint of the finger).\n\nThird important thing in controlled breathing. It''s VERY important that your breathing be as calm and "normal" as possible. Since the human body "heaves" slightly when we inhale or exhale, the best time to break the trigger is during what is known as a "respiratory pause"; that''s the point when we naturally pause between drawing in or exhaling out our breath. At that point, the human body is completely static so it''s the best time to take your shot.\n\nHope I made sense! :-)', ''),

While I really appreciate your efforts to allow us to  get into this sport, can I ask how come the prices are at such higher  rate on your web site (1200 PKR and 1500 PKR respectively)?\n\nRegards...[/QUOTE]\n\nDear taha, I am glad you have asked this question I will be happy to explain:\n\nA bag of 0.25g WE Precision BBs weighs 1Kg, let’s suppose you find a website on the internet which is offering this bag for $10, first thing you will have to check is whether that site will ship to Pakistan as 95% of the internet sites do not ship Airsoft products to Pakistan. In this scenario we assume that it does then the next thing will be the mode of payment; again most of the sites only accept Paypal. Third and most important aspect you will have to consider will be the Shipping Cost, the cheapest Airmail from Hong Kong (largest Airsoft goods market in Asia and may be in the world) will not be less than $20.\n\nLet’s suppose you have managed all of the above and your bag of BBs has finally reached Pakistan, now comes the Pakistan Customs in picture. I am assuming that the Custom’s Officer inspecting your Parcel is in a very good mood so he will impose the minimum possible duty on the package which will be around Rs. 500 including the ST and resealing.\n\nFingers crossed everything is going smoothly so far so we take it that the parcel has finally reached your doorstep after around a week to 10 days of waiting, now after paying “Eidi” to the postman your bag of BBs will cost you around [B]Rs. 3500[/B].\n\nTaha, I have personally been through the above scenario a couple of times so I would request you to order a bag from the site you have located on the internet and please let me know the actual price you end up paying.\n\nBelieve me even after a total monopoly in this field the prices I have calculated for these products do not leave me with more than 5% to 7% profit. After such a huge investment only an injudicious person like me would be selling at this margin.\n\n [B]Airsoft is more of a hobby to me than business.[/B]\n\nHave you ever wondered why a Glock or Beretta cost what it costs in USA and why does it cost what it costs here in Pakistan?', ''),

Whatever whenever anyone has hunted, in which ever country, province, legal or illegal it is solely at his own discretion and responsibility and we have no power to control or stop it. As a forum all we can do is request members not to hunt illegal species or indulge in poaching. There is no way for us to verify anything, it is the job of Wildlife departments to keep a check on illegal hunting and not ours.  \n\n[B]The PakGuns forum has it''s own rules of which content is allowed on it''s website and what is not[/B]. These rules are [B]not [/B]open for debate and are [B]not [/B]dependent on any provincial or national hunting policies of Pakistan or any other country. \n\n[B]The new rules are below. No pictures or information exchange of Hunts (legal or illegal) are allowed for the following species: \n[/B]\n1). All kinds of Markhors\n2). All kinds of Ibex\n3). All kinds of Urial\n4). All kinds of Deer\n5). Blue Sheep\n6). Marco polo\n7). Brown and Black Bears\n8). Leopard\n9). Chinkara\n10).

Pictures of the animals/birds themselves are welcome.\n\n2). Any content already posted prior to these rules were published will remain and not be deleted. Those threads will be closed. \n\n3). Although we don''t impose any bag limit on hunting pictures, before hunting and posting pictures please act like [B]sportsmen [/B]and not meat collectors.

Do not be rude. \n3). Do not indulge in foolish forum politics. \n4). If you have any suggestions email them to [EMAIL="Abbas@PakGuns.com"]Abbas@PakGuns.com[/EMAIL]\n5).

Kindly allow me to clarify that the bruised shoulder was not Saiga''s fault but it was mine. we were all firing the Russian Beast as if we are warding off a hoard of human flesh craving zombies. we fired slugs in such a manner that at such speed, other shotguns normally see spring and sprockets flying all over the place.\r\n\r\nI can talk for hours and hours about the superb balance, exceptional reliability, bomb-proof durability and quality trigger of Saiga but I would rather say that this shotgun simply boosts the testosterone levels in who ever fires it. with every shot fired you can feel the family jewels weight more and more. I would suggest if one is having hard time making babies, kindly consult SAIGA M.D.\r\n\r\nin my humble opinion, most shotguns cycle. some flawless whereas some less than flawless but a Saiga cycles like this:\r\n\r\nBoom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-Boom-Come get some-\r\n\r\nThe only kinda firearm that probably makes you wish for a zombie invasion. lols!\r\n\r\nNow to the things that I did not like:\r\n\r\n1. The buttstock for a little short for me. I really had to tuck my whole body just to sight in the target. which was pretty uncomfortable\r\n\r\n2. the sights on this particular saiga were of typical rib type. commonly found on hunting shotguns. this setup is good for speed shooting as it promotes instinctive shooting but they put the user at severe disadvantage whenever accurate shooting is required. in shooting slugs for example.\r\n\r\n3. lack of bolt-hold-open feature. this feature is found on most firearms these day however in Saiga it is not present (may be some other variations/model have it). therefore it was very difficult to know if the mag is empty or it has still some ammo in it. similarly, loading the shotgun was difficult because one has to hold the bolt open (by hand) and force the magazine in at the same time. in high stress situation, this can prove to be a real problem.\r\n\r\n4. Finish: if you feel that Baikal MP-153 is badly finished, wait till you see a Saiga. lets put it this way: you''ll know in an instant what kinda finishing you get out of a vodka influenced worker. lols!\r\n\r\nEnding Note:\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion a Saiga is what a shotgun was eventually destined to be evolved into. in the evolutionary ladder of shotguns, a SAIGA will always be on top.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like this opportunity to thank Denovo87 Bhai for their "as always" superb hospitality and awesome company along with my "all time" favorite food and the highly enlightening company of Avais Bhai who always openly shares his experiences without holding anything back.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Another way to do it is to get the bolt open - Lock it - (there is a button next to the trigger on the right side which when depressed will hold the  bolt in the open position) , load  the magazine and then release the bolt . It gets much easier that way. Unfortunately, the bolt does not remain open automatically at ejecting the last round.

I could see the joy on your face while shooting the gun. Btw you''re right the gun does not stay bolt open on the last shot but there is a way to load the mags and lock the bolt back. When you asked me the other day at the range, I was so eager to shoot the gun that I didn''t care if it locks back or not or if the mags load with the bolt closed, I just wanted to shoot the damn thing ! :nod:\n\nAlso I completely disagree about poor finish on the Saiga. It is infact excellently finished for a combat shotgun. The sort of usage this gun is meant for one cannot compare it''s finish with anything but the Ak47. I would not give a second thought to dipping my Saiga in a mud puddle, or throwing it around. When I picked up my Saiga and threw it a couple of feet away to the ground, what were all of your instinctive reactions when you guys thought I was going to do the same to the Benelli ? ;)\n\n This is what this gun is made and finished for, a Tank does not need Lexus suspension, if it does have one, it''s going to break down.', ''),

In this case i would recommend the CZ75B. If weight is that much of an issue then i would recommend a P07 Duty. you can find a review on the P07 in the Handgun Section, for the CZ75B you dont really need a review, its proven its worth already :D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Asif Ali;223596]If you like large frame they mainly can be used for HD, SD requires good Conceal Carry attributes which large frame cannot provide.

(384439, ' These days I''m defending the Saiga 12 fiercely and disagreeing with anyone who thinks this gun has any faults. ;) It is such a beautiful piece of engineering that in my opinion is as important as when Glocks revolutionized handguns with no nonsense Reliability and Polymer. To have a magazine fed relatively low recoil shotgun, with such a simple design which is extremely reliable, offering a rate of fire exceeding that of automatic shotguns 5 times it''s price in such a light weight and rugged package. Simply outstanding! The amount of lead you can send down range with a 30 round drum magazine is mind boggling. 30 SG/LG cartridges x 9 means sending 270 projectiles at your target in under 5 seconds !!! heh ;)\n\nBtw if anyone has shot them, auto shotguns like the AA12 or the USAS 12 are ammo sensitive.

The safety needs to be a little tighter so it doesn''t give way regardless of how many times and how hard I try to rack the bolt.', ''),

(384423, ' Hummmm,,,,Nice topic especialy for new or junior hunters. Clay shooting is totaly different from wing shooting, First of all consider it, what type of lead (forward allowance) do you use when shooting ducks? \n\n1. Swing-through: let the bird pass your barrel, then swing through it and shoot right at it as you pass through, or... \n\n2. Sustained lead: point at the appropriate distance in front of the bird while moving the barrel with it, then fire. \n\nFriends are asking and sharing about lead and I went straight to swing through but when people talk about lead they mean a sustained lead. \nAlso a very effective method and it also takes lots of practice to judge distance and speed to come up with your lead. \nI have used sustained leads that were probably near 20-30 feet shooting at fast moving divers at 40 yards. But  when ducks there over your decoys and slowed down pointing right at their head or just in front of it is all you need. \n\nThe longer I take to pull the trigger when leading a duck the more often I miss. When I just pull up and swing ahead of it and shoot in one smooth motion I''m more consistant. \nProbably half your battle will be to just get consistant with your gun. \n\nI said there is differance in clay and wing shooting but at the same time clay shooting can improve your swing study for lead. That''s where the clays come in. Don''t go out with just a box or two of shells and call it good.  Get to the point where after you shoot you don''t remember seeing the bead on your barrel or much of anything else but the target exploding. Don''t aim your shotgun. \nIf you''re aiming you''re concentrating on the bead and not the bird. When you don''t have to "think" about what your gun is doing you''re getting somewhere.\nAnother thing to consider is that your shot is probably leaving the barrel between 1200 & 1500 feet per second depending on what you''re shooting (Skeeter60 already defined very well).\n\n If those pellets stayed at 1500 fps for one second they would go 500 yards in that time. They get to 30 or 40 yards pretty quick but a duck can move right out of the way in that amount of time too.', ''),

(384449, ' @Crazy Shooter I agree with Hamid and Arslan_tareen brothers. Person using a classic side by side often encountered problems with semi autos in the begining. The most valid reason is the alignment of rear sight, rib and and the fore sight. Do a lot of swinging practice to be familiar with the gun alignment and bring the rear sight and fore sight in one straight line . When shooting on the target your alignment of the gun is almost straight and perfect but taking the bird on flying shots it entirely different. In this case normally you align the gun from 30-90 degrees and the most valid error is to point the flying object only with the fore sight. Hope once you overcome this problem with swinging practice you will start to achieve the desired results.\nAs far as chokes are concerned modified is central and ideal. However for doves you may start your practice with IC and go far cartridge no.8.', ''),
(384450, ' AoA\r\n\r\nNothing to be alarmed about Bro. most break open shotgun users find it hard when adjusting to semi autos. as to why? well.....semi auto shotguns have an entirely different feel, weight and balance. as a result they mount and swing differently. give it some time and you''ll be dropping birds in no time. you should dry practice the gun mount and swing in your home [B]after ensuring that the gun is absolutely safe ofcourse[/B]. practice mounting and follow the line where the walls meet the ceiling (swing practice) at least 20 times a day for a week. do it real slow. literally like a slow motion video cause it builds your muscle memory.\r\n\r\nin the mean time you can always check your shotgun''s point of aim by firing at a target from 16 yards with the tightest possible choke. for every inch your point of aim is off, you''ll have to adjust you shot gun by 1/16 inch.\r\n\r\nHere is something that might interest you: [B](taken from Pattern for perfection by Pete Blakeley)[/B]\r\n\r\n[I]When using a pattern board, shots should be fired from a distance of 16 yards, using a tight choke. An area should emerge, after five or six shots, where the bulk of the shot is concentrated and for every inch that the pattern is &#8220;off&#8221; target, the stock will need to be adjusted by a 1/16 th of an inch. So, by the same rule, that ¼ inch head lift converts into the shot going 4 inches high at 16 yards, twice that at 30 yards. At 40 yards a ½ inch head lift (and believe it or not, some shooters will come off the gun even more than this!)\r\nwhen we also factor the shot-drop in at this greater distance, may mean that well over ½ the original payload will miss the target. And here&#8217;s a word of caution. I see many clients, when using a pattern board under my supervision, concentrate hard on their gun mount and consciously align their eye with the rib every time. The result is a flawless point of impact printout on the board. &#8220;Ah hah&#8221;! Mr. Good mount says triumphantly. &#8220;Told you so. Nothing wrong with my gun mount is there?&#8221; Then this same guy gets to\r\nthe sporting clay course and under real situations, with a report pair for example, the second target a rapidly dropping chandelle, he lifts his head so far off the stock on the second target, that he might as well be shooting from the hip![/I]\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Anyhow, if experts have overlooked your query I would like to share whatever i know about it. \n\nSwing always mean to move barrel in the line of the flight of the object matching its trajectory and velocity. Better you catch the both, better you will hit. You missed any of them your chances squeezed. Practice and time will bring improvement automatically. Persistently following this practice you will be a good shooter one day. However natural instinct is an additional feature. I have experienced many new shooters quickly reached the satisfactory stage. Concept should remain unchanged rest will improve by practice.\n\nI would second the champion (Skeeter60) that sometimes you need to change your shooting style at once. For example, for long crossing birds I always swing an additional second to pull the trigger, it covers the leading concept to some extent but I did it in my routine. Similarly there are several more to know which one learn automatically like shifting of weight for high incoming bird to back foot or leaning forward for dropping bird etc. \n\nIn beginning I was being taught for two technics for overhead crossing bird and dropping ahead from rare bird. \n\nFor overhead crossing upward swing the barrel, cross the bird and hide full bird behind your barrels then pull the trigger and continue swing. For dropping downwards bird swing down the barrel, cross the bird and take the full bird over the barrel &#8230;. Bang with Swing &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. Both worked well throughout my life. Interesting thing is here to perform it all in a row without looking at barrels; otherwise, one will miss in both cases by feet behind the bird. \n\nWhatever, I have said is solely my own experience and I am not advocating to follow, however, if my practice needs some more improvement please feel free to advise me.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nSpeechless.

(384527, ' @ Faisji: Bro: excellent thread. I do not profess to know the ''magic solution'' for break in , but for all my semi-auto pistols that i get NIB, after initial cleaning/ de-greasing, i  run at least  a 100 rounds in quick succession &#65288;15 rounds per mag and 1 minute between each mag till i hit the 100 round mark). This would make the gun very hot but not hot enough to do damage.  Then another round of 100 rounds another day using the same procedure. My thought process behind this is that most  important factor to check in my handguns is reliability and this is to ensure that any TIGHT  clearances (that  are so close that as the gun heats up and the metal expands, the components will  rub enough to slow down the slide) would be smoothed out.   The objective of breaking in a gun is to wear enough off of these tight-fit  surfaces so there is sufficient clearance to enable them to slide smoothly over  one another even when the gun is hot, while not adversely affecting accuracy.\n\nAll my pistols are tactical use type pistols which have fairly loose tolerances when compared with customs-tightly fit pistols.The criteria I use  for determining whether a gun is broken in or needs more testing is how it  ejects.  A properly broken in gun will eject consistently, and the ejection will  be the same whether the gun is hot or cold.\n\nThe number of rounds needed to break-in a gun will vary  greatly depending on the type of gun, who built it , type of finish (blued or chromed), loads, and even springs.', ''),

Its now that I fiddle with the knobs a little bit and for elevation, first resort to shimming and only then to very slight knob adjustment , if required.\n\nI never aim into the sun, and always keep my cross hair on the bird,s legs as that gives a clear , more defineable aiming point then the rest of the body. \n\nwith air king its really a tall order to shoot without a rest, so I have devised an effective technique of shooting from the car,s window. If my bird is on the left side, I just park the car at a distance with a tilted angle and have the bird in my sight with out much ado.\n\nwhile zeroing at the range, make sure your body is relaxed .( I prefer the lying position). its good to use a couple of sand bags under the rifle as it settles well into the sand and after a while is motionless.take extra time to be precise when aiming as most of us dont "aim through" which is a common cause of poor grouping.\n\ntake a good clear view, utilizing the maximum veiwing field of your scope, dont shoot with the viewing circle constricted or shifted.(eye relief)\n\ngive very slight pulls of the trigger, infact the best shooters master ignoring the trigger and always have their attention on the target.', ''),

The speed of sound is about 1100fps. At this speed, your accuracy will suffer and there are more chances of your prey being scared away. Shooters select heavy pellets for such types of airguns so they keep the velocity under the speed of sound barrier, they have to give away a bit of personal choice.. You won''t find many different varieties in heavier pellets. .22 cal also delivers more energy thus gives cleaner kills at longer ranges. I PERSONALLY DON''T KNOW ABOUT GAMO SOCOM. You have choices like Gamo Raptor, Shadow 1000, Whisper and another one or two models available in Pak don''t remember the names. It will be good if you find any of these in .177 other than Shadow 1000. RWS34 is available in .177 cal in Classic and Panther variants, fps on chronographs are 15-20 fps higher than Gamo Shadow 1000 in .177, why not give it a try if you can handle the WEIGHT, though the Panther variant has lesser weight.

(384614, ' [QUOTE=Trajan;223113]@ Avais: Bro. Thank you for sharing. What is the best steel for such a knife and what is Damascus steel? thanks[/QUOTE]\nStainless steel''s quality is measured by its hardness. The more harder is the steel the more life of its sharp edge. In knives manufacturing 440 hardness of stainless steel is considered the best and it comes from Japan. On the other hand damascus is totally different technology. They make the ordinary steel more harder than any other steel. They take a steel sheet melt it, fold it and press in such a way that both the parts penetrate in each other. They repeat the same process in one sheet for 450 times, melting, folding and pressing.......(This is what they claims) and the ultimate product achieves extreme and optimum hardness. It is to be said that this technology was introduced in 12th century by a blacksmith in damascus and there in after Japanese refined the process. The swords of most of the Muslim conqurers and Japanese warriors were made of damascus steel. Only problem with this steel is that it is not stainless and gets rust quickly so it required proper anti rust oiling and care.', ''),

The front sight bead was again put back by the gun smith.The  transformation was excellent, it always brought down partridges quail, and ducks with consistency and to our greatest satisfaction.No 7 and 8  cartridges was the medicine for all kind of upland wing shooting and even for ducks on decoys.On high flying ducks of course No 4. It was named by my sons as our Holland and Holland.\n\nIf you are about to buy a gun  for your self always go for improved cylinder in the right barrel and modified choke in the left barrel for a fixed choke gun side by side.Of course in a gun with interchangeable chokes there is no problem.  \n\nSince you have already bought your gun, for flushed partridges you have to wait them out for the pattern to spread considerably and also to minimize the chances of spoiling the bird for the table.', ''),

I bought it a couple of months back. When you choose to buy a weapon you have to see a lot of things, like its availability in the local market, its caliber, size, suitability for which you are choosing it, potency and finally the price. Its not the best weapon out there in CC category but considering its price it is good, roughly around 55k. Other options might be Rami or a Glock 26, but if you have more money. Its biggest advantage is its very small size. In my opinion A Baikal MP-442 or Makarov is also a very good choice for a CCW. Mak has less mag capacity whereas MP-442 has more. But in this price range the Slim beats them all. The only thing which I have found difficult to master in this gun is the trigger, and hence accuracy.

I really cant explain what it feels like but Single set trigger just breaks you don''t feel anything else than BOOM here goes bullet down range, shooter trying it out first time (like I did today ;) ) surely get surprised by 2 or 3 unintentional  discharges ;)\n\nCZ-527 has free floating barrel which normally is flaunted in photos with 100 dollar note between barrel & stock fore end ;) to show barrel is not sitting on or in contact with stock. A free floating barrel is one of the traits a match rifle has to increase & maintain the accuracy.\n\n   \n  Fired total of 30 rounds today (mixed) without any issue of any sort. One thing noticed though not sure if its because rifle being new or characteristic of .223''s lean bolt or detachable magazine but found bolt bit hard or unstable to push (than my Parker Hale 7mm Mauser), had to apply more force to push it to chamber.\n   \n  Now to the bullet weight vs rifling twist; what ever I read was CORRECT..... 55 grn was the most accurate at 65 meters and NATO 5.56x45  is far better than Norinco FMJ among both 55grainer I tried.  75grn HP BT Armscor behaved worst, bullets dropped at target like an SG/LG balls would from 30 meters, that made me repenting on my greed which caused me buying 100 rounds; these have no use now, will try replacing these with NATO 55grn.\n\n  NATO 62grn (steel core; green tipped ones) were not that accurate but lot better than 75grn ones, I can try on boars after a little practice with these.\n   \n  Now the issue of 5.56 rounds in .223 chamber, main reason for buying this particular rifle was the CZ''s assurance that this rifle can be used with 5.56 as a regular fodder. I was trying to get a .22 mag for range rifling but as soon as got to know that CZ had one .223 rifle in their range that can eat cheaper 5.56 ammo I just dropped the idea of .22mag, although had to drop 200k more along with the idea but a center fire rifle is lot more RIFLE than a rim fired ;) specially when you can get the center fire ammo at the same price you would get rim fired.\n   \n  Now; little bit of porn at range ;)  (hope you like the gun rest)       \n      \n\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/001.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/002.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/003.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/004.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/005.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/006.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/007.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/CZ-527 day out 29-10-11/008.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

And frankly speaking, the small one was dead when I got to know in the morning, and I didn''t dare to search hectares and hectares of jungle for the larger one, that''s a mistake to shoot a larger one when your gun isn''t shooting properly, but the thrill to do something made me shoot at it, couldn''t do anything. BTW, thanks for your concern and I''ll watch out in the future.... But I know many elder hunters who still do stupid things and poaching.', ''),

I know its hardy noted in shooting but i guess it matters. I hope u get my question.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, the mid bead serves no purpose whatsoever. its there to ensure only that you have a correct mount. in sporting disciplines where shooters are allowed to pre-mount before calling in the bird, this setup comes in handy. the shooter just mounts the gun. adjusts his head, neck and shoulder in a way that the front bead just sits on the mid bead. at this point, any error in your mount has been corrected.\r\n\r\nhowever in skeet (Olympic) where you cannot pre-mount and must shoulder after calling in the bird, the two bead setup is of no practical use.\r\n\r\nthere is another advantage of two bead system. dry practice at home. you can always dry practice (after ensuring that the gun is safe ofcourse). slowly mount the gun standing in front of a wall and making sure that your mount always result in a perfect figure 8 (front bead sitting on top of mid bead).\r\n\r\nin wing shooting or skeet, a shooter should only concentrate on the leading edge of the target. the barrel should not be more than a blurry image in your peripheral vision.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Anyone should not go for it without having the consent of some people, or should read reviews first. If the Turkish ones were Hatsan airguns, well those are good as far as I know. If not, I don''t think they should be so expensive. Better get a trust-able Gamo in this price range. AND A CHINESE AIRGUN SHOULD NOT BE THIS EXPENSIVE, the claimed fps is always too much exaggerated and you can never depend on the performance as the variation per piece is too much. I recently got an under-lever Chinese airgun which even after 800 shots, could not be zeroed with iron sights, and a component broke off. And people were bragging that their B3 airguns had 750fps, I was to confused. When I got my B3-2, it said 600fps and after the 800 shots, I think the airgun was delivering 400-450 fps.', ''),

If the time span between range sessions is great then depending upon the weather conditions of your city spray some gun oil all over the external body of the pistol (without field stripping it), leave it to rest for 15 mins and dry it off to drive away rust and moisture. Have to be extra careful if the barrel is exposed like the ones with Pt 92 / 99. In case of an exposed barrel a very slight film of gun oil coating is recommended', ''),

Do not misinterpret my words, i dont mean that one should not clean the weapon, but i DO MEAN THAT DONT EXTRA CLEAN IT and save your money, you will need it...[/QUOTE]\n\nI beg to differ. Companies manufacturing cleaning materials are charging for convenience with products like bore snake. The bore / barrel can also be cleaned by swabs but bore snake is very quick. I personally use the traditional metal rod. Secondly one spends thousands of rupees in acquiring a good firearm but is stingy when it comes to buying high quality gun cleaning material and ammo. In the long run these things pay off.\n\nReplacing a weapon within the 60k range is easy when the gun starts to catch rust and not perform to its fullest but the same scenario in 100k plus pistols will incur heavy losses in the second hand market.  The more you maintain your firearm the higher chances are that it won''t fail you when the time comes. In SD / HD situations such a failure due to non maintenance can be life threatening.\n\nPeople also use sewing machine oil rather than gun oil but gun oil has greater viscosity and stays in place rather than the thin sewing machine oil which will just trickle down.', ''),

Does that mean that for JHps to be effectice to achieve a speed of 1,000 fps plus a minimum distance has to be kept beyond which they will loose their effectiveness ?[/QUOTE]\n\n@ Furrukh:  bro, first of all, ALL bullets, if placed properly on the target, can and will do some serious damage.  JHP''s are better as they expand and cause a wider wound channel , transfer almost all their energy into the target ( as they don''t over penetrate and hence dont'' usually exit the target).  for 9mm''s some schools of thought put in a velocity in excess of 1250 fps for proper/ consistent/repeated expansion at all self defense distances  for most bullets. Some very premium bullets would also consistently expand at velocities below the above mentioned figure, but they would be for specialized used such as for use with silencers (being subsonic @ velocities less than 1100 fps- speed of sound being around 1150 fps around sea-level).\nIf you can find 10 rounds of JHP''s i would suggest finding some +P rated bullets which are meant for higher velocities that would ensure more effective penetration.     You can check out  \n[URL]http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/9mmluger.html[/URL]   for a list of popular handgun 9mm parabellum bullets here which are listed with their velocities.    It is to be noted that the bullet velocity is also LARGELY dependent on the size of the barrel you are shooting them out of. For all  practical purposes  a bullet fired from a longer barrel would have a higher velocity (and hence increased effectiveness). i could not find PROPER statistics on the ARMSCOR 9mm in 124 grain JHP, but apparently their 124 grain FMJ''s are rated at 1090 fps  as per [URL]http://www.fivesevenammo.com/shop/page10.html[/URL] \n\nI would really not worry too much about this stuff. Just practice on your shot placement under stressful conditions (quick draw from cc position). If you can quickly tap the target 1x plus  in the proper area (more is always better) under stress and with decent JHP''s, these things pretty much become secondary.', ''),

Anyone should not go for it without having the consent of some people, or should read reviews first. If the Turkish ones were Hatsan airguns, well those are good as far as I know. If not, I don''t think they should be so expensive. Better get a trust-able Gamo in this price range. AND A CHINESE AIRGUN SHOULD NOT BE THIS EXPENSIVE, the claimed fps is always too much exaggerated and you can never depend on the performance as the variation per piece is too much. I recently got an under-lever Chinese airgun which even after 800 shots, could not be zeroed with iron sights, and a component broke off. And people were bragging that their B3 airguns had 750fps, I was to confused. When I got my B3-2, it said 600fps and after the 800 shots, I think the airgun was delivering 400-450 fps.[/QUOTE]\nThank you brother for your valuable feedback- I really appreciate it.\n\np.s.

I have shot them with No 6 and even 8 over decoys.\n\nUsing a duck call will also help in luring them near your hide, but use it sparingly, you can use decoys to your advantage too but don''t spread them too far apart.When they come in you can recognise them by the heavy swishing wing noise, and hear the splash when they alight near the decoys.\n\nHope this will help. \n\nGood luck.', ''),

(384990, ' [QUOTE=Furrukh;223326]I beg to differ. Companies manufacturing cleaning materials are charging for convenience with products like bore snake. The bore / barrel can also be cleaned by swabs but bore snake is very quick. I personally use the traditional metal rod. Secondly one spends thousands of rupees in acquiring a good firearm but is stingy when it comes to buying high quality gun cleaning material and ammo. In the long run these things pay off.\n\nReplacing a weapon within the 60k range is easy when the gun starts to catch rust and not perform to its fullest but the same scenario in 100k plus pistols will incur heavy losses in the second hand market.  The more you maintain your firearm the higher chances are that it won''t fail you when the time comes. In SD / HD situations such a failure due to non maintenance can be life threatening.\n\nPeople also use sewing machine oil rather than gun oil but gun oil has greater viscosity and stays in place rather than the thin sewing machine oil which will just trickle down.[/QUOTE]\nAgree with you.', ''),

I have shot them with No 6 and even 8 over decoys.\r\n\r\nUsing a duck call will also help in luring them near your hide, but use it sparingly, you can use decoys to your advantage too but don''t spread them too far apart.When they come in you can recognise them by the heavy swishing wing noise, and hear the splash when they alight near the decoys.\r\n\r\nHope this will help. \r\n\r\nGood luck.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nVery Informative,\r\nDuck Hunting at a new level for me, sounds quite fun too...

The ammo is cheap, the bang is low, and with using RWS subsonic bullets its no more than a spring airgun and there isn''t any recoil at all. In result that adds the benefit of even installing the most menial scope with menial mounts and still you will be getting great results at 100yds. As the rains struck sindh this monsoon, water-fowling has become very difficult if not impossible. But again if one has a .22lr at hand one can always go for water fowling without even stepping in the water. Though i have been searching myself for a decent riflescope but haven''t succeeded yet. I have CZ 452 standard, and installed a BSA Sweet rifle scope 3-9x40mm. I shot a stray dog from about 50 yards under its ear and the dog fell in its tracks. We have already discussed alot about .22lr''s lethality but as I have used the caliber i have learned that the prime thing is the shot placement without which one will never be able to drop any game in its track. I have seen doves flying off shot with 40 grain FMJs due to poor shot placement, as the bullet passed clean through the dove flew and fell after some distance, result of which was the bird couldn''t be retrieved or tracked. I have more to share as well regarding this beautiful rifle and the caliber that i will share later, for the time being it would be an honor to read about the experience of fellow members with this caliber and rifle.[/FONT][/COLOR][/URL]\n[/QUOTE]\n     \n[COLOR=#ff0000]P:S Edited the thread title & Post , regarding dove banned specie .

An arms manufacturer in Sargodha is making good air guns. You can read the  Air Guns Thread.

(385199, 'A Day Out With My Mistress - The FN 5.7 Salam All,\nI have noticed that on this forum there have been quite a few threads on the FiveseveN pistol.  Sooooo, today I got a much anticipated call from a brother of mine to come over to the Isb Gun Club and to bring the FN 5.7 as well.\nTwo variants were fired at approx. 25meters or 27yards at paper targets.  I shot only five rounds at paper and had fun putting dents in the quarter inch steel plates.  There is a video of all this I am trying to get edited which I will also post later on this thread... maybe by Saturday along with many more pics.\nGetting back to the guns, there was a adjustable sight model and a fixed night sight model to fire at the range.  Each fired about fifty rounds through the respective weapons - aside from the sights the only other variation was that on the fixed sight model a hogue finger groove sleeve was added for support and comfort.  My personal preference has always been aggressive checkering/design for grip on the grip which the FN has.  Both guns have the following: ambi safety placed in front/top of trigger guard, ambi mag housing allowing you to switch mag rel sides, a loaded indicator, the top of the slide is also housed in plastic (going a little overboard if you ask me) to give it a more appealing look.\nI picked up my FN and we danced.  Bang!  Wow!  I couldn''t believe it, exactly as stated by many owners, literally no felt recoil or atleast 30% less than 9mm.  AMAZING, the video will show my ear to ear grin as I was firing this doll.  The grip is very ergonomic and slim considering the magazine capacity is 20 rounds.  The sight picture was clean and clear.  The only thing I felt needed work was the trigger.  Although, very stiff, it was still very crisp and very smooth, there was no trigger lag.  Another amazing thing we discovered about both pistols - the ejected rounds all landed three feet to the front/right of the shooter AND all the spent casings were no more than a foot apart on the ground in one location.  Most guns'' casings end up everywhere.\nHere are the pics:\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/photo2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/DSC03599.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/DSC03596.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-2.jpg[/IMG]\nThe target above is mine - 25 METERS firing first time.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-1.jpg[/IMG]\nThe target above is my brother Baluch''s (PG member) also firing for the first time at 25 METERS.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/IMG_0038.jpg[/IMG]\n\nMe and our new member Baluch (forum name).\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/IMG_0056.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(385291, 'My Carry Permit -- Loaded firearm In continuation of my previous post.[B] I think this best defines a loaded firearm.[/B] I got it from an US attorney''s website. Basically even with the Section 144 exemption I cannot carry the firearm with a round chambered or the magazine isnserted in the firearm if the magazine has rounds.\n\nThere are three separate and potentially conflicting definitions of a "loaded" firearm which are applicable depending upon the circumstances. 1) Under Penal Code Section 12031 (g) a firearm is considered loaded when there is a live round of ammunition "...in, or attached in any manner to, the firearm, including, but not limited to, in the firing chamber, magazine, or clip thereof attached to the firearm...". For example, a semi-automatic gun with an empty firing chamber and a loaded magazine inserted in the magazine well is considered loaded. Further, under the "attached in any manner to" language, using certain accessories which attach to the firearm and are designed to store additional ammunition may cause the firearm to be considered loaded. A charged muzzle-loader is not loaded if it is not capped or primed. This definition applies while on any public street or in any public place in an incorporated city, or on any public street or in any public place where it is unlawful to discharge a firearm in unincorporated territory. If a person is in the process of committing or attempting to commit a felony, a firearm is considered loaded if ammunition is in the person''s "immediate possession."', ''),

But finally when i got hold of it, i saw that its lower part of the neck was ripped apart due to the sheer impact of 1435 FPS winchester HP and the other former 2 bullets had also hit it and it was still breathing until i had cut off its jugular vain. \nIt''s obviously not the value of the dove that made me spend 3 bullets and a good 30 min time for all this exercise but it was a responsibility of sports not to let an injured game be in more pain and to retrieve it. Again i learned it the hard way how important is shot placement when it comes to rifles.[/QUOTE]\nThat''s the spirit... and maybe you should use some other bullets, JHP''s over penetrate, why not hollow points? They may waste a lot of meat though. Nice to hear about your experience. We had the same issue hunting doves with a HW80 .22cal once. The magnum pellets used to over-penetrate, and would create huge wounds, but the doves still managed to glide until they died...... that was like 2-3 fields away. We tried our best to retrieve them.', ''),

(385345, ' Salam All,\nTHANK YOU ALL for your comments.\nI paid a little more than what our Dear Abbas bhai has mentioned due to that ammo.  Yes, most in Karachi were and still are being sold for 750k without ammo.  The ammo is very scarce I was able to collect some here and there AND still am always looking for more.... Ammo price of this thing varies so no SET rate as I have picked up rounds for as low as 50/rs as well as up to 2000/rs a ridiculous round!\n\nThis gun in my opinion, had there not been an issue with ammo, makes for a great hip-carry-gun.  I won''t wear it on the ankle.  Then again mine is not for carry; I wanna slowly make it a range gun.  Its lighter than a G19 loaded atleast it definately felt like that.  I don''t have a trigger pull measuring gauge but I felt it to be around 5 or 6 lbs.  I opened it up to see if this problem could be remedied but the trigger and other springs were coil (non compression) springs meaning cutting a coil or two will only render this pistol workless.  Still I too don''t give up that easy... other springs are on the way along with a threaded barrel ;-).  I am thinking a compensator, smooth trigger, and some other stuff... \n\n@Abbas - bhai, wait, I meant what I said, big n sexy wearing only ammo, coming soon.', ''),

Needless to say the MOON role in migration process but it doesn''t means the ducks wears a "Sulemani Topi" in low moon days. Its a seprate myth though.\n\nOnce this last inward migration period ends with this rising moon ducks will complete their first phase of migration. In secong phase these flocks will further migrate to sindh and costal areas but a huge number of ducks will still stay here. These will be considered settled ducks. \n\nRangpur and adjecent areas are the one of the places where ducks resides and miniscules impact of moon position can be observed after this moon. \n\nThe reason you return home empty is understandable becasue ducks migration spell yet not started and yet to reach this area, however, not too far away. Previously migrated ducks have left this area and migrated ahead to avoid the heat weave presistantly hitting till last week.\n\nGood flocks are being reported at chashma these da. Anyhow, as soon as this migration took place the ponds will have adequate birds everywhere and everyone will get his share everywhere.\n\nI am expecting a good spell of big ducks in upcoming fortnight but everything is possible due unpredictable change in weathers but big ducks are still awaited and they will certainly hit our grounds in days to come. Lets hope for good.\n\nPartridges season is expected to be opened from 15th Nov. this year. This will again make necessary changes in plans for waterfowlers and preferences goes with partridges always. Many have already started though.\n\nHunting is a game a passion we should make ourself prepare for any such happenings and forget about number of birds in bag but always keep a close eye over their behaviours.', ''),

Unfortunately the red tape, government interference and corruption is not worth it. Everyone can be making guns left right and center and no one will be asked a question, only the largest and properly setup, tax paying factory will get frequent visits from all kinds of ground level bureaucrats/officials like law enforcement, taxation, health and safety etc etc whose sole concern in life is just to make life miserable for the person doing business in a legal way.\n\nOn the same topic, I was seriously considering setting up a large, mechanized ammunition factory in Pakistan targeting the domestic market solving our problems of quality decently priced ammunition in all commercial calibers. But as I started to work on my project I found out that I had to go through about 20 + Government bodies and the ''costs'' for making them all work were just not economically viable.

(385425, 'The Shooting Error Chart: Find your problem ! Salams, although this has been posted time and again at PakGuns I can''t stress how important this little chart is. Even though I''ve shot quite a bit, I always keep a print out of this chart with me at the Range. A quick glance at it instantly corrects one''s errors.\n\n\n\n[B]The Wheel of Misfortune[/B]\nEvery day of the shooter''s life brings a new lesson. Identifying errors are crucial in order that these lessons be learned. The following chart can help pinpoint such basic flaws in a shooter''s technique by analyzing group locations. As printed, it is for a right-handed shooter. (A left-hander''s chart would be mirrored horizontally.)\n\n[IMG]http://www.adjunct.diodon349.com/attack_on_usa/pistol_and_revolver_error_analysis_and_correction_files/image002.gif[/IMG]\n\n [B]Top Eleven Bad Habits of Shooters[/B]\n[B]1.         Not Looking at the Sights. [/B]This quite frequently is listed as "looking at the target." A shooter may be focusing his eye on neither the sights nor the target, but since he does not see the target in clear focus he assumes he is looking at the sights. You must concentrate on sight alignment. \n2.         [B]Holding Too Long. [/B]Any adverse conditions that interrupt a shooter''s ability to "hold" will cause him to delay his squeeze, waiting for conditions to better. The disturbing factor about this is that you will do it unconsciously; therefore, you must continuously ask yourself, am I being too particular? \n[B]3.         Improper Grip or Position. [/B] Suffice to say that you cannot fire a decent score with any gun at any range if you continually change your grip or position. \n4.         [B]Jerk or Heel. [/B]The application of pressure either with the trigger finger alone or in case of the heel, pushing with the heel of the hand at the same time. Apply pressure to the trigger straight to the rear and wait for the shot to break. \n5.         [B] Anticipation. [/B] Anticipation can cause muscular reflexes of an instant nature that so closely coincide with recoil that extreme difficulty is experienced in making an accurate call. Anticipation is also the sire to flinching. \n6.         [B]Loss of Concentration.[/B] If the shooter fails in his determination to apply positive pressure on the trigger while concentrating on the front sight his prior determination needs renewal and he should rest and start over. \n7.         [B]Anxiety. [/B]You work and work on a shot, meanwhile building up in your mind doubt about the shot being good. Finally you shoot just to get rid of that particular round so you may work on the others. \n8.         [B]Vacillation (Plain Laziness). [/B] This is a mental fault more than a physical one, which results in your accepting minor imperfections in your performance which you could correct if you worked a little harder. The end result being you hope you get a good shot. Just like you hope you will get a gratis tax refund, and you will get one just about as frequently as you get the other. \n9.         [B]Lack of Follow Through. [/B] Follow through is the subconscious attempt to keep everything just as it was at the time the shot broke. In other words you are continuing to fire the shot even after it is gone. Follow through is not to be confused with recovery. Merely recovering and holding on the target after the shot is no indication that you are following through. \n10.     [B]Lack of Rhythm. [/B]Hesitancy on the first shot or any subsequent shot in timed or rapid fire. Develop a good rhythm and then have the fortitude to employ it every case. Frequently many shooters will have fine rhythm until the last shot of a string and then hesitate, doctoring up that last shot. \n11.     [B]Match Pressure. [/B]If there are 200 competitors in a match, rest assured that there are 200 shooters suffering from match pressure. So what makes you think you are so different? If you are exerting all your mental energy toward executing the correct fundamentals rather than the arithmetic evaluation, your shooting match pressure will be what you feel when people congratulate you on a fine performance.', ''),

(385453, 'Astra 200 &quot;Firecat&quot; (6.35mm) AA & greetings all! My father, this very evening, unveiled a sterling piece of family history: an Astra 200 "Firecat" which belonged to my paternal grandmother. This gun was manufactured in Spain by "Astra Unceta y Cía". My grandmother bought it in 1966 as a CC weapon from Majeed & Sons here in Lahore. It''s a 6.35mm (.25) caliber semi-auto, carries 5 rounds in the mag, comes with 3 safeties (grip safety, magazine disconnecter & thumb safety). It''s an all-metal gun (frame, slide, grip, etc) with a chromed barrel and feels quite solid. The slide rides smoothly and trigger pull is crisp with very little creep (I dry fired it a few times, don''t know if that gives me an exact representation of trigger pull with a round in the chamber). The magazine release is actually a little latch on the heel of the grip which needs to be pulled back to release the mag, therefore switching mags is a real pain. Other than that, it''s quite a little pocket rocket! Only thing left is to take it down to the range and let it rip! :-)\n\nMy grandmother bought a box of 25 rounds with the gun and, till date, this gun has fired only [B]FIVE[/B] rounds; so it''s basically in near-mint condition. Don''t know much else about the gun, except that it fit quite well in my hand (and I have big, beefy hands!) and was pretty comfortable. Despite being all-metal, it''s light enough to carry around in your pocket without any discomfort.\n\nHere are a couple of pics I took (please excuse the poor results, I was way too excited to run & get my camera, so used my cellphone instead!)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5460[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5461[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5462[/ATTACH]\n\nI had a couple of questions:-\n1)  The ammo is almost 40 years old (bought in 1966), so is it still safe to shoot?\n2)  Is the ammo for this gun (6.35mm) available in Lahore/Islamabad?', ''),

I''m hoping they''re there for more than mere eye candy! :-p\n\n@Faisji\nYes the mag capacity is 6, not 5. It was a recursive typo on my part. I did some reading on the .25 ACP and apparently the S&B ammo is the best, so will go hunting for some soon. Crazy Shooter bro mentioned that they cost around Rs. 80-90/round which is pretty steep though, but I''ll definitely get a 50-round box and burn through it in a single day! :-)', ''),

I could hear him, [I]vaguely only[/I], but definitely not as loud as he was being heard from the "shareef people" around, hahahaha!\n\nYou probably will have to take Ayaan along with you, lolzzzzzzzzzzzz!\n\nAnyhow, the point is, at Rs. 275, they for for sure seem to be promising. There was another pair also at Rs. 375, but I found these fitting tighter to the ears. May I just add, these are probably the things used by the road-side labor using  pressure hammers or the like, so as long as a cal.45 shot could sound to me as a cal.22, well, that''ll be good for the go. Will test them out on Eid, Inshallah ( earlier, if my night guards should happen to [I]doze off[/I], lol).\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(385556, ' [QUOTE=Prince;223988]I second Avais, a proper fit of gun never need such practice. The length of pull is troublesome in this case.[/QUOTE]\nAbsolutely correct. \nThe length of pull is short, or in simple words the butt is short for you;  install a thicker recoil pad, thus increasing the length of the butt by about 1/4 inches and the problem will be cured. \nThis is a common problem when the length of pull is short for the shooter. You could also have wooden shim placed between the recoil pad and the butt. A nice armourer can do a very neat job.\nAnother remedy is to wear a Jacket with a shoulder pad ,this you will in any case, with cold weather approaching and you will not have to increase the length of pull.

Didn''t really get a chance to play with it till today.\n\nIt''s a fun toy, looks and weighs very much like the Glock 17 except it doesn''t have any markings. Airsoft was telling me he''s getting new ones in stock with markings but this one looks original enough. The only thing included in the box is the gun itself and a mag. Not much else to say about it except the build quality is average. I would be quite careful while disassembling it, the dis assembly lug is just a piece of plastic and will break quite easily. The sights have a glow in the dark kinda paint on them, a few minutes in the sun and they will start to glow a bit. The mag holds around 25 BB''s and the mag on full gas will fire almost all of them. The gas nossel is found under the magazine butt plate. The amusing thing is the ''safe action'' trigger almost works like the original.\n\nOut of curiosity I tried to see how far the BB would go on a full magazine before it hits the ground.

In the past then years, I have only had two people approach me regarding the purchase of spares and even then it was only the recoil rod and the front/rear sight.\nIts nice to see you prepared for such a day; however, my suggestion would have been to buy the custom stuff and what you take off your OEM would be spares.', ''),

The 22-250 loses its accurate life after a couple thousand rds.\nFor example a .308 Win will have nearly 3 to 4 times the barrel life of a .300 Weatherby Magnum.\nBoth use the same bullet but the  large case volume and the large amount of propellant  passing through the same bore size takes its toll. The .308 Win is propelled by generally 40 grains or so, where as the .300 Weatherby will be propelled by nearly 80 grains or so of the same powder ( I am just giving a general idea not load data please ) the bore dia bieng the same .308; there fore \n the bore wear and the wear of the throat of the barrel is very high in case of the big magnum. \nThe .308 Win if of Match /Sniper grade will have an accurate life of about 3000 rds depending on various factors like propellant, bullet weight and methods and frequency of cleaning etc. A normal military grade or hunting rifle would be usefull till 5000 rds or more.\nThe big Magnum will be shot out well before it can shoot even a 1000 rds but then these big Berthas are only shot for zeroing and then 2 or 3 rds on game once or twice a year at extreme long range and heavy animals so it makes sense.', ''),

After taking the leopard and lion on a South African hunt with Ingogo Safaris in 2006, he returned to Africa in 2008 to harvest a Cape buffalo. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQKhx2TyzbUsvIsGPglduRrin9sHpV5QSrDZWNHSZoMvx1wCl1boA[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThat same year, he also brought down a rhino on a green hunt, during which he used a tranquilizer dart as ammunition and the animal was released unharmed after being examined by a South African wildlife and conservation biologist. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://c362.r62.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/articles/Butch_display.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOn all of Meilinger''s hunts, his weapon of choice was a Horton Archery crossbow. During the first three successful trips -- the leopard, lion and Cape buffalo -- he used a Legend 175 but after speaking with Horton''s pro staff head Riley Foster, he opted for a Team Realtree 175 for the last trip because of its accuracy and the fact that it''s lightweight and easy to transport. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://c362.r62.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/articles/legend_175_display.jpg [/IMG]\r\n\r\nIn order to give him the best chance of effectively penetrating an elephant''s thick skin, Meilinger also had Danny Miller of Sardis, Ohio, custom craft six heavy-duty carbon bolts for the hunt. \r\n\r\nHunting with Helgard Beukes of Somerby Safaris, the same outfitter he had used for the rhino trip, Meilinger began his pursuit of an elephant along the Matetsi River, adjacent to a forestry reserve that was closed to hunting and served as a refuge for the animals. \r\n\r\n"What we did was we would ride around all through the day trying to find something we could approach, specifically a lone bull because it''s less difficult than approaching a herd," Meilinger said. "After six days, I had seen 60 or 70 in herds but they were always in the protected forestry area where we were not allowed to go." \r\n\r\nAt night, Meilinger, Beukes and crew would set up in a blind at a watering hole between the refuge and some agricultural areas the elephants were visiting to feed. While they were hoping to ambush their prey, they were also hoping they wouldn''t become dinner for another hunter patrolling the area. \r\n\r\n"There was a lion hunting that water hole, too. We saw him a couple times. He was there five or six nights," Meilinger said. "It was quite unnerving to have him roaring for two or three minutes nonstop every 20 minutes to two hours." \r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of the hunt, Meilinger finally got his chance at an elephant after the hunting party saw two large bulls traveling in a group of about 15 or 16 animals. \r\n\r\n"We actually saw these two bulls cross just before dark as we were heading back (to the watering hole), so we scrambled because when they got down to the bottom of this ridge, if they turned right they were going to that conservation area, and if they turned left they were going to that water hole," he said. \r\n\r\nFortunately for Meilinger, the animals made a left. After carefully but quickly making their way toward the watering hole, the hunting party caught up with the herd. \r\n\r\nWith the wind in his favor, Meilinger stalked to within 16 yards of one of the bulls and was able to make a perfect shot that put the animal down. \r\n\r\n"As photos were being taken, I can remember feeling like a huge burden was lifted," he said. "When I first took the leopard, I had no idea if it was even possible to take Africa''s Big 5 with a crossbow. I guess what made this so special was that no one had ever done this before." \r\n\r\nAccording to Meilinger, the elephant''s left tusk was 53 inches long and weighed 31.5 pounds while the right one was 54 inches long and weighed 32.5 pounds. The animal is the pending No. 2 crossbow harvest in the Safari Club International record books and Meilinger has had replicas of the ivory made for his home. \r\n\r\nThe elephant itself, however, was given to a nearby village, which put the entire animal to good use. \r\n\r\n"The next morning, 15 or 20 people came from the village with their children and with baskets on their backs," Meilinger said. "They get all the meat from that animal, every piece. They worked on it, they skinned it out. \r\n\r\n"The ivory goes to the government, which then turns it over to wildlife artists and craftspeople who then sell it and generate revenue for their villages. There were 42 to 46 people in that village. They were going to be in supply of meat for 70 to 90 days." \r\n\r\nWhile Meilinger is indeed proud of harvesting the elephant, he says the most memorable and challenging of the hunts was his pursuit of a leopard. Not only was it an incredibly difficult animal to locate and get close to, he also had a too-close-for-comfort encounter with the big cat when he finally caught up with one. \r\n\r\nAfter unsuccessfully pursuing leopards on two previous hunts, Meilinger was finally able to get close to one on his third hunt after a pack of hounds cornered the animal. During the encounter, however, the cat turned and charged Meilinger''s vehicle, ultimately leaping at another jeep that had pulled into the oncoming animal''s path. \r\nAlthough he eventually killed the leopard, Meilinger called it "four minutes of hell." \r\n\r\n"He slammed into the wheel well on the driver''s side, dented it, went underneath (the jeep) and bit the valve stem on the left front tire, which went flat," he said. "He came back out on the driver''s side, jumped up and hooked the rain guard, and literally the only thing separating his face from the driver''s face was the window. He slapped and cracked the window twice and took off." \r\n\r\nWhile Meilinger is now busy planning for a trip to the Arctic to pursue musk ox, he says taking Africa''s Big 5 is an accomplishment he will never forget, especially considering he did it with a crossbow. \r\n\r\n"It takes a lot of effort to accomplish some of the things I have done. Without a doubt, the trackers and professional hunters are the most important," he said.', ''),

That scared the hell out of me. Then I wait 5 minutes and after wrestling with a few times it opened. It was very dirty inside, so I disassembled and cleaned it completely and it fixed the issue until again it happened after firing 20 rounds. I repeated the process and put the gun away and decided it wasn''t for me and waited until for another option. As soon as Kevin came out I was all over it.

(385865, ' We discussed it at length an year or so earlier.\nTo put it in simple lay mans terms, the Ballistic coefient is the co eficient of form or shape. It means how well a bullet will overcome air resistance. The higher the BC number the better it would resist air. Air resistance is the biggest enemy of bullet velocity. It increases with the increase in velocity and it depends heavily on the following;\n\nCaliber and Weight ratio\nLet us say we are using a rifle, we should know that the heavier bullets of any given caliber will be more likely to resist air depending on the factors mentioned below.\n\nSHAPE\nA pointed bullet or a Spitzer bullet will have a higher Ballistic co-effecient than a Round nose or Flat nose bullet or a Semi Spitzer Bullet\n\nBASE\nThe bullet base plays an important role in reducing Air resisitance, a Boat Tail Bullet will have a higher BC or better ability to resist air than a flat base. \n\nNow that we are aware of the factors we can say that the heavier bullets of a given caliber with Spitzer points and boat tails will have a higher ability to retain velocity and resist air and there fore will have flatter trajectory and higher terminal energy.\n\nIngall made the tables for BC in the US by using a 1000 grain bullet of .50 cal with different shapes and bases and the Ingalls tables were used as a reference for a long time.\nThe science of aero dynamics has progressed so much that the trajectory of a bullet can be predicted extremely well over a long range when barometeric pressure, humidity and temperature are known.\nAlso it has been discovered that the BC changes with very high velocities, and yet again as the velocity of the projectile begins to drop due to air resistance. The Dopler Radars have been used to completely profile the trajectory of each type of bullet with varying BC and velocity and the complete trajectory can be predicted to the entire length of flight of the bullet. \nFor our basic hunting knowledge and purposes I think we have a fair understanding and we can discuss it further in Q&A  form', ''),

Ackley Improved which removed the case taper and also the shoulder angle was increased like modern cartridges and thus the case capacity  increased allowing heavier powder charges.\n RCBS made dies and Clymer made reamers to ream the chambers of the 7 X 57 to accomodate the Ackley Improved cartridge with an enhanced performance, which was in some cases better or at par with the .280 Remington. \nThe 7mm 08 was concieved to put the 7mm bullet in a .308 case so that Short Actions could be made use of with this fine cartridge. \nAlso the military surplus .308 cases could be necked down and used.\nThe following cartridges pay tribute to the  7X57;\nThe 7mm Po Ackley Improved\nThe 280 Remington\nThe  284 Winchester\nThe  280 Ross\nThe 7 X63 Sharp & Hart\nThe 7x61 Brenneke\nThe 7mm Rem Mag\nThe 7mm Mashburn\nThe 7mm Westerner\nThe 7mm Super Magnum\nThe 7mm Weatherby magnum\nThe 7mm 08\nThere are another half a dozen 7mms which are spinoffs of Paul Mausers 7mm a great bullet and Cartridge which combines the highest BC and Sectional Densities in a medium bore cartridge.\nIn my humble opinion  this is a great cartridge which spawned all modern cartridges, including the 30-06 and the 270, and yet remains the most modern by itself, and copied all over.\nThe 270 bullet is .277 where as the 7mm bullet is .284 a difference of . 007. Yet it means bullets from 130 to 175 grains can be used effectively in the 7mm, where as the 270 is only at its best with 130 gr bullets the 140 and 150 gr bullets leave it handicapped.\nA Modern 7mm Rifle with good ammo is anytime more versatile and desirable than a 270.\nThe 270 can never come close to the killing potential of the 175 gr 7mm bullet for Neel Gai.\nThe 30-06 is positively more powerful and gives flatter trajectory and allows the choice of a large range of bullet weights and types.\nMore later', ''),

Are you going to make DC /DCO entry in LHR ? & LHR PS entry to follow............. or\n\nAre you going to risk yourself and travel all the way to KHI with your weapon for to make legal entries ???\n\nOr leave your weapon after purchase and only bring receipt along with lic to make relevant entries ....... \nAnd again go back to get weapon ???\n\nAnd I think purchase receipt from LHR will make problem to have "Smooth Weapon Entry" in KHI as the respective dealer is not on their list ...........(Its from different province)................\n\nThese same issues are also faced when you have MOI lic also (On Second Purchase, but fresh Lic can be parked anywhere in country)...........But again if I park my MOI lic in LHR for first time,,,,,,,,, will I always travel from KHI to LHR for weapon change, DC /DCO entry and Where will be my local PS entry will be ??\n\nSo this is why we stick to "Home Town" until we are a frequent traveler or a second home in that city ....where we may park our local address to over come later issues .................\n\nRegards....', ''),

I have seen Neel Gai taken with a .243 at 250 yds a fluke as the bullet passed between the ribs and was stopped after passing through  the heart;\n and have also known of a so called shikari who took one with a .22-250 at 30 yds with a neck shot; this was a  "Khan sama " shot with a search light in the poor animals eyes.\n In real day light hunting first of all a Neel Gai will never be visible except in the rut season and that also at least 300 to 400 yds away. If animals are to be murdered sitting in a jeep with a search light in their eyes then this is a futile discussion. Any caliber will kill at 30 yds. \nIf we are to take fair day light shots on Neel Gai then 30-06 or 7mm mag or a 7mm Mauser with heavy 160 to 175 grain bullets is the answer. \nA 7mm Mauser is now almost 125 years old and still popular for good reasons it fires long heavy bullets at almost the same velocity as a 270 and these are so lethal that Major W.D.

(386562, ' The ballistics of the 7×57mm became popular with deer and plains game hunters. The relatively flat trajectory and manageable recoil ensured its place as a sportsman''s cartridge. The 7×57mm can offer very good penetrating ability due to a fast twist rate that enables it to fire long, heavy bullets with a high sectional density. This made it popular in Africa, where it was used on animals up to and including elephants, for which it was particularly favoured by noted ivory hunter W. D. M. Bell, who shot 1,011 elephants using a 7×57mm rifle, when most ivory hunters were using larger-caliber rifles. Bell selected the cartridge for moderate recoil, and used 11-gram military full metal jacket bullets for reliable penetration. Bell sectioned an elephant skull to determine the size and location of the brain, and used careful aim to ensure bullet placement in the brain.', ''),

(386564, ' .308 vs. 7x57?\r\n\r\nFrom a trajectory stand point they are almost identical with factory loads like Hornaday. The Mauser should have a slight advantage if handloaded in a modern rifle.\r\n\r\nFor point blank shooting ~300 yards and inside the .308 should carry more energy in factory loads. Way, way out there the 7mm''s better BC means it might have more energy (I haven''t broken out the carts to check).\r\n\r\n.308 is easier to find and last I checked it was a fair amount cheaper to buy factory loads.\r\n\r\nThe Mauser has less recoil/muzzle blast and is more pleasant to shoot given all things equal. The .308 isn''t a bear in the recoil department, but it is above the 15 lb recommendation for new shooters (weight can tame it below).\r\n\r\nThe Mauser really shines when handloaded, but it''s really more than adequate for almost all medium game in almost all situations in factory form.\r\n\r\nThe .308 is a genuine short action round, the 7x57 is inbetween long and short and called intermediate length (but is usually put into a long action). This is not an issue if you are looking at a single shot like the Ruger #1.\r\n\r\nI consider anything beyond 300 yards out of normal hunting ranges. Out to 400 yards the both maintain more than a 1000 ft-lbs of energy. There is only on average 2" of difference between the trajectories as well at 400 yards. This is comparing 140 grain 7X57 to the 150 grain .308 using Nosler Partition bullets at Federals web site.\r\n\r\nCourtesy: [url]http://thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?p=2635907[/url]', ''),

In USA and Europe there are wide choices regarding the stock length of the guns but since in Pakistan we have very limited choice and we are bound to buy whatever is available with the dealer. My arms are small and I am feeling the problem of length of pull with the installed stock of the gun. It is difficult to reduce the length of stock because of K.O. system.', '');

Reduce Quality of Manufactured Goods to remain price competitive\n2. Pass on the increase in costs to the end user.\n3. Benefit from Economies of scale through Mass Production (distribute fixed component of overheads over a large number of units produced so as to manage unit costs) - CHINA is the classic example.\n\n[B]I would like Pakistani Manufacturers to improve quality or atleast maintain it, to ensure long run sustainability of business. \n[/B]\nBTW Moawia, perhaps you may also manufacture Air King or Magnum range airguns through reverse engineering.', ''),

(387012, 'An idiotic experiment Salams all,\r\nI know that the account of my experiment that i am to share would be enough for the gurus on the forum to cease my rights of possessing ammunition but still i would like to share the experiment though not a big feat but still it matters as i achieved what i wanted.\r\n\r\nSo what I had on my mind was actually to try and reduce the powder amount in a .22lr ammo and following were the reasons why I wanted to do it:\r\n\r\n1) I couldn''t use cheap FMJ ammo on birds, as the the FMJ ammo due to high velocity passed through the bird and as a result the bird always after being shot flew a little and eventually fell some place it was impossible to retrieve.\r\n\r\n2) I also wanted to reduce the power because I am not a big fan of "BANG" and my hunting of birds with a .22lr was already producing enough Bang to cause fear in the birds and scare them away using a standard high velocity ammo like Armscor.\r\n\r\n3) Subsonic ammo is available at a ridiculous price at around rs45 each, so idea of turning a standard armscor bullet that costs me rs16 each to a subsonic bullet always had fascinated me.\r\n\r\n4) I have an open space of 23 yards in my home, and due to the fear of ricochet I couldn''t plink around with FMJ ammo.\r\n\r\n5) Knowing the lethality of the .22lr ammo and the distance it covers i wanted to reduce the power.\r\n\r\nSo those were the few reasons due to which i wanted to undertake this experiment of converting standard ammo into subsonic ammo. I know that the rimfire is a nasty creature when it comes to the sensitivity of its rim. I did observed all the possible safety measures i could, and trust me no one likes me more than myself:).\r\nI removed the tip of the bullet from the case took out all the powder out of it and then divided it into three parts and then put back that 1/3 of the powder back. Though i am still struggling to find a correct and better way of taking the tip out without damaging the case. I don''t have any tools that would assist in the reloading process but the fact is my reloading is for the sole purpose of less risky plinking and not to undertake some big game in the wilds. here''s the video watch impact and listen to reduced bang of the .22lr. there is another video using a standard bullet watch, compare and comment.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpKDex85H9k[/url]   (Homemade Subsonic)\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVd4OVW9aq8[/url]  (Standard armscor ammo)\r\n\r\nP.S: As stated in the thread topic this is just an idiotic experiment. Kindly be advised that this share is only for the sole purpose of education, and do not try it yourself.', ''),

If it was not for this inventor, designer, and manufacturer, we can picture the fun missing from our lives. The Stevens company’s history goes back to 1864. In 1920 Savage Arms bought Stevens Arms. Some guns were identified until 1936 as Savage-Stevens. Savage used the Stevens brand name until 1950. During the life of the Stevens brand, it manufactured several types of firearms in several calibers, including the now world famous 22LR. Just one company alone in the world - CCI manufactures 4,000,000 LR cartridges every day. There are dozens of other companies that also manufacture the 22LRs. You can pretty much imagine the quantity of 22LRs manufactured, sold and expended every day of the year.\n \nPrior to starting his own firearms business, Stevens worked for Samuel Colt - the inventor of the 45 Colt pistol; Eli Whitney - the inventor of the cotton gin; Cyrus Allen - manufacturer of the turret repeaters; and Massachusetts Arms Company - now known as Smith & Wesson.\n \nAgain, let us give full credit to Joshua Stevens for bringing out a cartridge that makes many millions happy - including me. Stevens died at age 92 in 1907 - the year my father was born', ''),

(387168, ' Skeeter60,\n\nSorry for the late response as I was busy with couple of projects I am working on to help students in BWP. Members on the site have already taken notice of my absence for a while.\n\nUnless someone is willing to expend oodles of money on custom guns, working around the variables that can be controlled is the way to go for accuracy. I hope we both agree that two rifles coming from the assembly lines in sequence will behave differently using the same ammo in both guns. If there is agreement on this point, then we can discuss the variable that we can control. \n\nMost gunners use commercial ammo for their needs. The ones that are into competition shooting are more demanding than the casual shooter.  The 22LR caliber is a breed into itself that can be discussed at another time. As to the center-fire commercial ammo, many of the variables can be tested without firing the cartridge. I have weighed cartridges and taken measurements of neck diameter and bullet depth dept from the ogive point. I have taken apart these cartridges to weigh the projectile, propellant and the case capacity. Finding changes in all these elements introduces comulitive degrees  of error when the weapon is fired. At this point in time we are not considering the variables that of the weapon itself. With a commercial cartridge, the least we can do it is to sort it by weight and test those on the range that weigh the same. Of course the more makes and types of ammo you test, the better the chance of finding the ideal fodder. A cartridge that is good on the range may not be suitable in the field. Where I am, hunt is allowed only with sold point bullets.  \n\nNow we turn attention to hand loading. Here we have ample opportunity to control many of the variables. Other than the variation of the propellant within a given batch, we can precisely weight the power, weigh the the bullet and its dimensions,  and adjust the seater die for a consistent depth. Having "precision" die   helps in controlling the depth to a precise point. Once the cartridge is ready we test it at the firing range. Now we can vary adjust and monitor our two main variables - namely the propellant weight and the seating depth. We go back to the range and test again. The starting point of this exercise of reloading is to rely on well established reloading handbooks with a caution - for safety sake, not to exceed the maximums given in those handbooks. The key to accuracy repeatability - each time, each element of the cartridge to be the same.\n \nAs to what can be done to the weapon itself to improve  accuracy,  that is a topic for another day.', ''),

O M G it had tons of Grease on it.. :) Cleaned it to see the actual airgun.. bai wah it is pretty good.. lovely bluing and stock finish... Couldnt wait to fire a few shots with it at say 30 metres range.... the first shot actually pierced a pieca of wood (irani pellet 5.5 mm pointed tip).. hmm. power seems to be good. aimed and shot say 15 pellets at the same range.. it is off target.. say about 3 inches to the right and 2 inches above. but pellets landed consistently in the same area.. about an inch apart (i was not using a rest)... left kaisay kerooon? errr errr errrr.. Moawia bhai sight has up down setting but no left right.. Jaldee bunayain left right adjustable wala. Kidding :mod:. I''ll be mounting a scope on it once ive shot atleast 300 shots with it. Ppl attempting to zero in a scope before properly breaking in wont be able to zero or perhaps setting may change after 50 odd initial shots. \n\n2 Questions for Moawia.\n\n1. Does it have a leather piston seal? I have two spare synthetic piston seals for my other Diana 45..If the diameter is same will it fit? Synthetic seal is known for faster piston speed and also seals better (more compression). Leather seal is kinda more forgiving if airgun is shot accidentally empty and overall it is more reliable in the long run but needs some silicone oil say 2 drops a yr of USE to avoid leather hardening. Airgun should never be fired empty as it results in seal/ piston and or compression tube damage... Heard even loose pellets (pakistani) deteriorate seal quality but thats more gradual.\n\n\n2. The Spare spring has 34 coils, the same as my original Diana 45 spring also 34 coils which i have in spare. But wire diameter of original Diana seems to be more than the Rainbow Spare spring provided. Both springs have same length? Do u recommend a spring change now or should i break it in on its original spring n when it starts showing loss of power i shuld get it changed? \n\nAs for barrel lube Ive tested and regularly used [B]Slick 50 One Lube[/B] spray once a year, it contains PTFE (teflon). THe same non stick material used on non-stick pans and household steam iron. Clean the barrel, 2 small bursts down the barrel, keep the airgun upright to let it sink into the compression tube. It reduces Lead Dust in the barrel which causes inaccuracy and also lubes seal and cylinder wall with teflon, maintains piston speed. Fire 10 dry pellets and u r good for a year.

(387331, ' [QUOTE=AsimKhan;225348]What would be the current price of  1. Westley Richards - SxS 12g (English, old/new) 2. Webley &amp; Scott - SxS 12g (English, old/new)  and Where can I find one in Peshawar or Rawalpindi?[/QUOTE]\n\nThe English Shotguns are divided in two basic categories, the Side lock and the Box lock. The Side locks are about 4 times or more expansive than a Box lock of the same make.\n\n Then there are a number of Box lock Models specially by Westley Richards which have varying quality and hence price. A Westley Richards Box lock with Drop Locks is actually just as expansive as its Sidelock and in fact more sought out. \n\nOver here the main thing is to see if the lugs have been repaired and what is the condition of the shotgun,  these days people buy beat up guns have barrels made in Darra and after filling the lugs fill up with metal or by Argon welding  then file it to shape  to tighten the gun which was rattling badly due to use and abuse.\n \nThe original mid rib with the writing is used and a new stock with beautiful walnut is made is made for it.\n \nThere are a few mechanics in Darra specialising in it and have very senior and educated fraudsters who help them and then sell these guns. \n\nTo catch a re built shotgun see the following; If the gun is original and in very good condition it will speak for itself. How ever if the gun is an old one with shiny barrel , the barrels are desi.\n\n English guns show corrosion due to mercuric primers of the 60s. The Proof marks when viewed with a magnifying glass will be obviously forged and larger than these should be.\n \nWhen you dis assemble the gun and view the lugs or lumps you will see a half moon from the sides. This is where the gun was repaired and will start to rattle again within a 100 shots.\n \nThe Firing pins, hammers and inetrnal parts are all desi and some times abbreviations are stamped on these to give an authentic look. \nSome times  they even use cheap Spanish makes like Kestrel and Spanish Churchill side locks and write English makers names; but some how an experienced person can always catch these by observing keenly. \n\nThe stocks are more beautiful than most English guns  have as we have the best and most beautiful walnut. \n\nThe engraving is nothing but a repitition of commas; I am told the engraver Umer Gul has improved, Jameel is the stock maker and Repairer. \n\nMistry Akram at Baksh Illahi Lahore is a very nice and honourable person; always show him a gun and he can tell you all about the gun you want to buy. \n\nThere are experienced persons  who can help you buy a used  English gun. There are still some virtually brand new English shotguns available but these command a lot of well deserved price. I have seen some brand new Webley&Scotts for about 250,000/- and also fakes which the seller always claims was presented to his father by Liaqat Ali Khan or the Viceroy which is all bullshit. \n\nA Westley Richards gun in new condition is worth buying at any price. Like from 8 lacs to 10 a Holland with self opener and a Royal Deluxe would be cheap at around two million and can be worth  4 million if in new condition with high grade engraving.\n\n The guns are there and show up for sale now and then  always with a sad story; A widow of some gentleman or a spoilt son of some gentleman who wants a "Panj Satti " an auto 5 shot and some money by selling his late father''s soul and dream gun.', ''),

In this regard we both are on the same track - learning and teaching. \n\nI am student first and a teacher a distance second. My formal education and experience is the the filed of finance. I am equally at ease in talking to an illiterate who makes a living by farming as I have also framed. I learned to drive a big Caterpillar tractor before I leaned to drive a car. I teach farmers in BWP how to determine the output of their tube wells without any fancy equipment. One farmer told me that the monument (stone marker) of one of his kila (acre) corner was missing. On that visit I had a GPS with me.  I set out to solve the farmer''s problem. Working three days and two night I had a solution. Now one can take me out blindfolded anywhere in Bahawalpur District. With the GPS in hand and my pre-calculations, I can tell you the block number, sub-block number, kila number and the distance to all four corners of that kila from that spot where I stand. All this knowledge came about when that illiterate farmer told of his missing kila marker. \n\nI am the son of a one-time patwari who wrote "Atalik Patwar" which was first published in 1941 in Lahore. For many decades it became the standard textbook for those who wanted to become patwaris.

In the teaching setting, I learned from students and they learned from me. \n \nBeing from the old country, I am proud to learn that you were a part of the Pakistan Shooting Team.

(387409, '22LR Affinity Common dictionary meaning of the word &#8220;affinity&#8221; is &#8220;natural attraction, liking or feeling of kinship.&#8221; Many millions upon millions of us in this world have affinity for the 22LR. Why do so many people like this diminutive cartridge? Perhaps it for the same reason that common human instinct calls for backing up the underdog - the little guy.  Psychologist may be able to shed some light on such behavior. For those of us that have had this 22LR kinship, it was love at first sight with the first experience.\n \nTo be Number One in anything, it has to be exceptional. And, the 22LR is exceptional. Unlike the center-fire cartridge the 22LR can let you enjoy shooting for a longer period without worrying about your pocketbook. You can hone your shooting skills with the 22LR and deploy that confidence when you take out your big caliber rifle. Here is my often-repeated suggestion. If you have multiple guns and a 22LR is not in your collection, unload (meaning sell) one and with the proceeds buy a 22LR and still have money left over to buy lots of 22LR ammo. You don&#8217;t have to get a new rifle. Get a &#8220;clean&#8221; used one. Some that don&#8217;t look cosmetically clean can turn out to be excellent performers and excellent buys. If the 22LR is going to your first and only firearm acquisition - take along a gun nut friend with you when you are ready to buy one. He can lead you away from the ones that look nice and fancy but perform poorly.\n \nCome and join us.  When you get your 22LR, you will become our kinfolk - part of the family.', ''),

Joking Sir, love teasing my seniors, do not mind, plz!\n\nAnyhow, I was wondering - since we''re already discussing the history of the .22 here - if you could elaborate kindly a bit on the "going off" of a rim-fire bullet, what actually happens inside the shell at the time of fire, what specific thing is it that makes the fire go off as in comparison to the center-fire, is it the "compression" of the powder charge against the rim, or what, that makes this caliber so damn reliable, I mean in terms of going bang every time?? I trust the[I] proofing[/I] of a .22 shell is better also than the center-fire, right?\n\nAlso, kindly suggest me a good .22 rifle, because I have no doubts contracted your "virus" over here and may take one any time in the nearest future. Skeeter Sir availed a German make called Krico lately, and at very reasonable price also. What''s your experience on this make/type, though I''d have appreciated more details from Skeeter Sir  on the model.

It reduces Lead Dust in the barrel which causes inaccuracy and also lubes seal and cylinder wall with teflon, maintains piston speed. Fire 10 dry pellets and u r good for a year. Mineral oil is a no no for compression tube as it causes dieselling and sticking which slows down piston speed and reduced FPS.

When an air gun is fired air temp inside the cylinder may rise upto 2,000 degrees but only for a fraction of second.. therefore any oil residue is burnt up. but when u have the spring changed u may want to clean the entire compression tube using a cloth tied to a long brush or plastic rod.. break a plastic hangar or use a piece of wood. long screw driver should be avoided as it may scratch the cylinder walls. nothing abrasive should touch the cylinder wall. recommended lube for piston is Moly Grease also called MOS2 (molybdenum di sulphide). Clean piston and apply light Moly to the seal.. anything else will quickly burn up and is useless. \n\nDue to our dusty and moist environment before storing ur airgun always lube the barrel and cover its exposed/open end with a plastic bag to avoid moisture and or dust creeping in. Care will keep ur gun going for yrs.', ''),

Many modern manufacturers limit the iron sight radius in order to have reasonable space on top of the receiver and portion of the rear end of barrel to accommodate a telescopic sight so as to clear the rear iron sight from the objective lens of a riflescope, if one is to be installed.\n \nHere a way to visualize how the length of the barrel and sight radius impacts the &#8220;sighting&#8221; of the target in the horizontal plane. Let us say that the rifle is mounted at a point where the chamber and the rear end of the barrel meet. The mounting is on fixed plate that can only be rotated in horizontal plane. The radius of the plate is as large as the length of the barrel. The longer the barrel - the larger is the radius of the plate. The outer edge of the smaller plate may only be able to accommodate markings perhaps at just one- degree intervals. Larger plate may be able to perhaps accommodate one-degree minute markings. With an even larger plate resolution of the markings may be in degree, minute and second markings or even more refined.\n \nThe subject is very simple - larger sight gives better angular resolution in the vertical plane than a shorter sight radius. The same holds true for rear iron sight that adjusts the elevation. The larger the sight radius, the better the resolution of the rear sight markings. With a larger sight radius and larger number of rear markings, each vertical rear sight mark will make the target adjustment in the vertical plane more refined.\n \nThe above discussion is applicable to all rifles and pistols of any caliber with iron sights.', ''),

(387643, ' [B]AoA Hamid Sb.[/B]\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things that need to be sorted out before pursuing a solution for the LOP problem.\r\n\r\n1. the standard length of pull on Baikal MP-153 synthetic shotgun is 14.5 inches whereas your measuring tape is showing 14 inches. the LOP is a straight line from the center of the trigger to the center of the butt pad. try using a retractable tape measure, you''ll find that its 14.5 inches.\r\n\r\n2. the desired LOP of 15 inches to me seems a lot. remember whatever you calculate as [B]IDEAL[/B] doesn''t mean that its going to be practical as well. they say: calculate your ideal LOP then use a shotgun 0.25 to 0.5 inch shorter as it allows you to compensate for thick/heavy clothes in winters and light clothes in summer. you don''t want your face to seasonally migrate up and down the sloped stock. lols! one more thing, shotguns with longer LOP are slow to mount. they might be more comfortable but they slow you down, make the gun more muzzle heavy and significantly increase the chances of snagging (from clothes and stuff) during the mounting process.\r\n\r\n[B]Here is an ideal (Ideal, not practical) LOP chart:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/LOP-Chart-Height-10-72-Grid.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n3. Increasing the LOP on a synthetic hollow stock (of any shotgun) is a real b^^ch. some creative problem solving is required because the recoil pad fits into the hollow cavity of the stock. so a stock spacer will have to be designed in such as way that it partially fits inside the hollow cavity (one side) and the recoil pad has to in the hollow cavity (other side). the spacer will also have a collar machined around its edges to prevent it from going all way inside the stock under recoil.\r\n\r\n[B]Slip-on Recoil Pad:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.chuckhawks.com/sims_limbsaver_slip-on.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nthe easiest that I can think so far is a slip-on recoil pad. it might not be a perfect solution but it will save you from the trouble of designing a stock spacer. plus if things don''t work out, you can always take it off. the downside is a slight chance shifting of the slip-on recoil pad during recoil. the stock spacer is geared towards a person with a long term fix in mind.\r\n\r\n[B]Stock Spacer:[/B]\r\n\r\nThe stock spacer was made for a Baikal MP-153. It was later taken off as I realized that Ideal measurements are not always practical. :)\r\n\r\nThe spacer is made out of polypropylene. very soft (to touch) and durable polymer material. it is spray painted (matt-black) to match synthetic Baikal MP-153''s furniture.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011197.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011198.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011200.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011202.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011203.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/LOP/17112011204.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

There are very few hunting pics in my records but since couple of years Children are on face book though i did not have my face book account yet. Now a days cyber events and our hunting stories instigate the young generation for posting hunting pics and stories because with every coming day good hunts are becoming dream. New generation even could not imagine the hunts of our age which we have enjoyed. Their instigation added little encouragements particularly for me to have pics and discuss everything hunt related openly. I agreed it is not a good part and we are forgetting lot of things. Thank you very much for refreshing my responsibilities towards my passion and I will try possible care while discussing the hunting matters. However grant me little margin for the errors.

The 32 was giving me trouble, I can''t recall what it was. The NZ75 was beauty, but again Chinese metallurgy has never been something to write home about! Then you''d argue "But what about the Norc now?" Well the metallurgy is crass, to say the least. But the NP44 is GREAT weapon besides that weight issue! It is accurate (no matter what anyone says); and there''s nothing to beat a hi-cap 1911 in 45acp! Nope, NOT even a Glock. You see, comparing Glocks and 1911s is like comparing apples and oranges.

The river basin measures 67515 km\r\nThe source of Chenab is at 77°- 30° E and 32°-50° N and lays in Lahul and Spite district in Himachal Pradesh India. \r\n\r\nThe river forms at the confluence of the two streams called “Bhaga” \r\nand “Chandara” which flow along the Baralcha pass at an elevation of 5,000 M and join at a place called Tandi in Jammu and Kashmir State (India). \r\nBesides Bhaga and Chandra, Bhut nullah and Manu also enter the river from right above Salal Dam. \r\n\r\nChenab is joined near the boarder by two major tributaries, the Munwar Tawi and Jammu Tawi both draining some 2,800 Km of land on both side of the two rivers.\r\nChenab enters Pakistan just upstream of rim station Marala (32°- 40N and 76°-29E). The total catchment area upstream of Marala is nearly \r\n28,000 Km\r\n\r\n  The distance from Marala Barrage to confluence point with Indus river at Mithankot is 598 Km. The river slopes from the source to the mouth vary strongly, with the steepest part, about 25 m/Km upstream of Tandi. \r\n\r\nFrom Tandi to Akhnoor the slop is 5m/Km and it drops to \r\nabout 0.4 m/km when the river flows out into the plains. Below Akhnoor it becomes wider and the flood plain is enormous. \r\n\r\nDownstream of Marala the river width varies from 700 to 1400 m whereas the flood plain is about ten times as wide as the river.', ''),

Once magwell is on the body of the plug, then use a pointed non-marring punch to push the nub down hard, and slide the magwell over it.\r\n\r\nYou will need a non-marring conical punch, or a will have to use the handle of your hammer smartly to push the nub/plug back in.\r\n\r\nThe job would have been easier if I had a vise, as without the vise, there was a strong need for a third hand!\r\nThanks again \r\n\r\nInstalled is a 13# main spring, extended firing pin and reduced power firing pin spring  Although in due honesty, the difference in trigger feel is negligible, and almost not noticeable for most shooters.', '');

A university professor of physics can explain authoritatively that rifling twist direction is related to the gyroscopic effect which dictates drift of the projectile. The professor can also explain in scientific terms that firing location on earth and direction of fire is related to Coriolis effect. Cumulatively, gyroscopic effect and Coriolis effect determine the overall drift of the projectile.   \n\nI only know university professors there at IUB in Bahawalpur.  On the next visit I will be more than happy have them introduced to anyone that may be interest in receiving a formal scientific answer to question posed.\n\nAfter one or more professors give lecture on the topic, we will have some tea.[/QUOTE]\n\nYou are right , the long range artillery shooting at targets 30 km away do take into account the Coriolis effect ,rotation of the earth, and atmospheric pressure temperature etc but shooting a .22 at a max 100m concentration on the sight picture and trigger control is  all we need.', ''),

Also, I noticed that it is much easier to rack the slide with these lighter springs, so when competing in stages where one has to load a weapon, this is a definite must.

The river basin measures 67515 km\nThe source of Chenab is at 77°- 30° E and 32°-50° N and lays in Lahul and Spite district in Himachal Pradesh India. \n\nThe river forms at the confluence of the two streams called “Bhaga” \nand “Chandara” which flow along the Baralcha pass at an elevation of 5,000 M and join at a place called Tandi in Jammu and Kashmir State (India). \nBesides Bhaga and Chandra, Bhut nullah and Manu also enter the river from right above Salal Dam. \n\nChenab is joined near the boarder by two major tributaries, the Munwar Tawi and Jammu Tawi both draining some 2,800 Km of land on both side of the two rivers.\nChenab enters Pakistan just upstream of rim station Marala (32°- 40N and 76°-29E). The total catchment area upstream of Marala is nearly \n28,000 Km\n\nThe distance from Marala Barrage to confluence point with Indus river at Mithankot is 598 Km. The river slopes from the source to the mouth vary strongly, with the steepest part, about 25 m/Km upstream of Tandi. \n\nFrom Tandi to Akhnoor the slop is 5m/Km and it drops to \nabout 0.4 m/km when the river flows out into the plains. Below Akhnoor it becomes wider and the flood plain is enormous. \n\nDownstream of Marala the river width varies from 700 to 1400 m whereas the flood plain is about ten times as wide as the river.[/QUOTE]\n@ TR\n\nMan, do u want to say that the mighty INDUS is inferior to Chenab river by any means? \n\nNO NO NO … Sir, please.  \nDoubtlessly, the Indus flyway (Green Route) is something mammoth comparing the rest of the rivers, by all manners. Yes, we can say PG hunting section paramount by the Gujrat hunting since this season starter but please be fair in facts and figures always.', ''),

Karachi market has never been stable with prices of guns, big variation from retailer to retailer. I''d suggest you look up the numbers of some of the popular dealers like Daad, Tayabeli, Guns & Accessories, Pioneer Arms, etc, and get a telephonic impression first.\n \nGuns & Accessories at Zamzama should have most variations available, yet have a tendency to over-price his stuff. Compare with other''s prices first and then talk to him.\n \nBasically a 50-55K item like the Stoeger, with large scale sales, cannot have too much of fluctuation, maximum 2-3K''s from one shop to the other, unless you appear totally new to guns and some smart one tries to make his day!\n \nAppear with confidence and as if you know the entire market situation, then bargain down. Also, avoid the cheap Pathan dealers, as to avert a second hand purchase, and they might even have a lower price for it, as to lure. Purchase from the more established ones as I''ve mentioned above, and preferably from a guy who can put forth some 3-4 boxes before you as to choose, and never show interest in any specific one, ask for the prices of all first ( There may be different tags for older version/railed version/black/two-tone, etc).

Meat does''nt count but friends always. I enjoyed the trip and togetherness. \n\n\nThanks for remembering and sorry for delays ........ matchless hosting.\n\n\nDuck hunting is a serious subject when its limited and settled, it needs patience and dedication always. Those who are not much in it always act similar beasue they got impatience when ducks flow stops and starts doing those practices in hide which even a blind ducks can sense. This is the reason I hv limited my hunting to my team specifically. It takes time to understand that what leading caller has requested to the partners and who much they trust their talks with flocks, so poeple who are rare together do what we seen last day ................. Hahhahaaha ..... \n\nOne good flight is adequate sometime to bag upto your desires all u need is a sense relates to hide nothing more nothing less. We were at fun and i enjoyed few shoots despites errected wings, forget about the meat we lost but the trusting ur barrels. I will never allow someone to take risk of life without a life-vest just for the birds. we can get more but not lives.\n\n\nExcellent place scouted and good too good approach, hopefully, this will get fruitish during reverse migration. \n\n\n@ TR\n\nwe all are equally good to lead as life has spent in hide, anyhow, thanks for the compliments sir. This is hardluck we were shoot of movement otherwise i could pay the price of leading from front ................. hahhahahahaha\n\nNice day-out really. i love it[/QUOTE]\n\n@Prince brother, Humm, but...I will not consider any invitation by hunters,,, because I am hunting with friends but not with hunters only. Hunting with every one, or with anyone is not my priority but I am hunting only and only with my friends. No thanks for hosting, brother hosting is our tradition. \nNo doubt yesterday was a good day with friends at field.\n\nYou are a master duck caller with rich hunting experience. I am enjoying my scouted spots with permanent hides and I am satisfied even in poor movement days, because I spent time and men power to draw and select the field spots for whole season with good and bad movement aspects.', ''),

(388289, ' The "stuck bullet" problem is 1911-specific, and not related to the .45 ACP. The 1911 of any manufacturer will fire all kinds of ball ammo without any hitches. It''s the specialty ammo (like JHP''s) which gives the 1911 problems. The issue lies with the 1911''s extractor. Custom 1911''s, like Taurus or Kimber or Dan Wesson, have modified extractors to facilitate specialty ammo and so function without any problems most of the time. It''s usually advised not to use a full-loaded mag with a 1911 before it''s been broken in. Other .45 ACP pistols, like the Taurus 845, do not have such stoppage problems like the 1911. I''m sure the seniors and 1911-owners here will be able to better elaborate and clarify.\n\nThe 1911 is, IMHO despite being a 100-year old design, a flawless pistol that continues to do what it was designed to do: Fire military-grade ball ammo. Under most circumstances, a broken-in 1911 packing ball ammo is enough to cope with any SD/HD situations.', ''),

(388540, ' Masroor Bhai,\nAs u are seasoned campaigner and know about pros and cons of game why don&#8217;t you agree that hunter are themselves responsible for tarnishing the inland species. We all are indulged in this menace and never let the opportunity to go way whether its closed tehsil, close period or by any other unfair means. We have to think about it otherwise upland game will be in stories only. Anyhow, it&#8217;s a arduous topic and ends with bad mood no more please.\n\n\nThe most devastating element which has resulted in our postulations about ducks migrations and movement is now very much clear to me. Hunting is a every days game for people now. Doubtlessly, people are heading towards hides without any breaks now. \n\nThe majority of them are not particularly seasoned hunters they wants birds & meat by one mean or another. Excessive daily hunting since few years is the core reason that regular migration patterns badly disturbed. Birds didn&#8217;t allow staying any place just entering our homeland. They just cover the distance till coastal areas with a warm welcome everywhere every time.\n\n\nHow can u find ducks in particular days like ever, now way. Yes, find some places far away where still people couldn&#8217;t have reaches and excess one can find adequate birds rather more than ever before because birds too need to stay calm somewhere.\n\n\nThis is so common that we cannot raise finger to anyone in particular. Be part of it or just enjoy wilderness. Which is within itself a blessing in blessing these days.\nWhat we can conclude is that let the others do whatever they like to do and we will at least follow the game day&#8217;s rules. \n\n\nI am not much ethical or conservator but applied some particular rules to satisfy within myself. There no need to dictate people to go on with my or any others wishlist but lets have some game norms within ourselves to save future hunting otherwise ...............\n\nAt least our moral obligation is not to encourage and appreciate openly disclosed off days game by any means without giving any negative perception we must not reply to their misdeeds. This is the best reply to their cruelness. Let them wait till official days to come or cross to put their bag under legal frame then we cannot do anything anymore.', ''),

This scope i heard comes standard on Gamo Bigcat 1200 n 1250 airguns. With around 300 shots fired before scope mount, ive managed to zero in. The technique tht works for me is tht I set the windage (left right) before setting the elevation (up and down). Minor adjustment if required, set only on an average of 05 shots.. Do not screw in our out if it is an inch or half an inch off on every shot.. With this trigger. thts bound to happen. Also when shooting remember you need to PRESS on the trigger not PUSH it with a jerk and also maintain aim till pellet hits the target. This works for me every time.

It''s the specialty ammo (like JHP''s) which gives the 1911 problems. The issue lies with the 1911''s extractor. Custom 1911''s, like Taurus or Kimber or Dan Wesson, have modified extractors to facilitate specialty ammo and so function without any problems most of the time. It''s usually advised not to use a full-loaded mag with a 1911 before it''s been broken in. Other .45 ACP pistols, like the Taurus 845, do not have such stoppage problems like the 1911. I''m sure the seniors and 1911-owners here will be able to better elaborate and clarify.\n\nThe 1911 is, IMHO despite being a 100-year old design, a flawless pistol that continues to do what it was designed to do: Fire military-grade ball ammo. Under most circumstances, a broken-in 1911 packing ball ammo is enough to cope with any SD/HD situations.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nDear friends, I''d like to interject, if I may. I use an NP44 for SD/HD and CC (:p however much of that''s possible) and I went into a cold sweat my gun FTEd the very first round!!! One of the main reasons is that the gun doesn''t have a feed ramp - polished or otherwise - so the very first round (now listen to this.....!) was a Serbian SJHP ! So, to add to the misery of not having a feed ramp, a SOFT-NOSED round was bein fed into the chamber ! This was but to be expected, one of the range gurus Raza Tareen informed me! \n\nThat REALLY got me into action and I subsequently fired 200 rounds through the iniquitous weapon and lo and behold! I can fire shrapnel through it now without a hitch! But let me qualify that. These Serbian .45acp rounds have pathetic casing. they dent at the drop of a hat. Probably, therefore, they loosen at the seat and sometimes the round will easily come out of the casing. No other round that I know of does this, but a 185-grain .45acp SJHP is VERY bad news for ANY bad guy! \n\nThirdly, the NP44''s magazines are nothing to write home about unless you are one very lucky individual and good mags with your gun. \n\nI hope i''ve helped.', '');

(388434, '22LR - Right or Left Twist Rifling? A firearm with right twist rifling is fired. From the moment the trigger is pulled and the bullet enter the rifle bore it starts to spin. Initially the bullet is in line with the bore. As soon as it leaves the barrel, gravity takes over and the bullet is no longer traveling in a straight line; it starts to head down range toward the ground. The bullet is being twisted or torqued to the right. This rotation gives the bullet a push in a 90 degrees direction from the rotation. In physics this twist or torque called the gyroscopic effect or drift. This drift for a typical 7.62 mm projectile is about 10 inches (9.5-10 inches) at 1,000 yards. This drift equates to about one minute of angle (MOA) at the given distance. One MOA is close to 10.47 inches at 1,000 yards. For a right hand twist the drift is to the right. For left hand twist the drift is the same but to the left. Long-range shooters understand this drift.\n \nThe earth’s spin causes acceleration which in physics is called the Coriolis effect or drift. The Coriolis drift has two parts - one in the horizontal plane and another in the vertical plane. The amount of horizontal drift is dependant on the firing distance above or below the equator. This effect is zero at the equator and approaches maximum toward the poles. A conventional 7.62 mm projectile fired from Aquitaine, France (location - exactly 45 degrees above the equator) will drift about 2.5-3.0 inches to the right at 1,000 yards.\n \nThe Coriolis vertical drift depends on two factors - the direction of fire and the location of fire on the earth. Maximum vertical drift is at the equator. Firing eastward will result in projectile hitting high. Firing westward will result in projectile hitting low. A 7.62 mm projectile fired eastward from, Acquitaine, France, will have vertical drift resulting in impact 2.5-3 inches high at 1,000 yards. Shooting westward, the projectile will hit 2.5-3 inches low at the same distance. Firing north or south will have no vertical drift.\n \nGyroscopic drift and Coriolis drift are not related to each other but act independent of each other. Combining the two drifts determines the overall effect. In practice the shooter makes sight adjustments to compensate for the mentioned drifts. For the northern hemisphere shooter, left twist rifling can compensate for the gyroscopic drift. From long ingrained old habits, manufacturers keep churning out right twist barrels. For scientific reasons the need is for left hand twist rifling as majority shooters live north of the equator.\n \nNot everyone in this hobby is a long range shooter. All the same, an avid shooter want to know how the rifling twist direction effects a projectile. He also wants to know how his direction of fire and the distance from the equator influences the fired projectile. Such knowledge in our hobby need not be held like a family secret. The sole purpose of this site is to share such knowledge with each other.', ''),

(388447, ' As Skeeter60 mentioned, you created a dangerous situation. \n\nIn essence your projectile/propellant ratio became such that it created higher than normal pressure in the chamber and the barrel. Such practices are limited to those that are in the business of testing and proofing firearms. Such testing laboratories have very stringent safety measures and safety devices for such tests.\n\nIn testing and proofing firearms, one method to increase pressure in the chamber and barrel is by increasing the amount of the propellant in the cartridge. Another method to do the same is by increasing the weight of the projectile. In your case, what you did was in essence increase the weight of the projectile without realizing it. The actual weight of your projectile was the same but by reducing the amount of the propellant, the projectile/propellant ratio increased thus creating higher than normal pressure. Recommended maximum pressure standards for firearms are set by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute (SAAMI).\n\nWhen the cartridge with reduced propellant was fired, the projectile moved slower from the chamber and into the barrel.

(388469, '22LR - True Love My fascination and love of 22LR goes back a long time - very likely longer than most member have been alive, back into the very early 1950&#8217;s.\n \nIt came about by way of an experience that I would rather forget. At our farm near Liaquatpur, my father saw some doves on an acacia tree. He motioned to me to grab his double barrel 12 gauge Holland & Holland shotgun and have try at the birds. Not by design but buy accident, I pulled both triggers of the gun. To this day I remember the mule kick I received in the shoulder. I wanted something that did not kick as hard as even a single barrel 12 gauge shotgun, I wanted something that was more tame.\n \nAt that time my own guns were two .177 Webleys - air rifle and air pistol. I liked both air guns. One of my cousins at that time had a bolt action 22LR. I tried his rifle and like it. As time passed, both of my air guns wore out from very heavy use. At that time they could not be repaired in Bahawalpur. When the time came for replacement, I was given a bolt action 22LR. I can recall the brand name of my air guns but for the life of me I can not recall the brand name of the 22LR rifle. I do remember that it was made in Czechoslovakia. Perhaps it was a BRNO.\n \nOver lifetime I have had many different center fire caliber rifles. My interest in those calibers peaked and waned. But, the fascination and love of the 222LR never left me. To this day it is still in me and with me.', ''),

He was quiet, slightly aloof, dedicated to flying and sincerely loved his brother. Although he wasn''t the loud-mouth spoiled brat as shown in the film, he was more pragmatic than his brother and knew full well that war not a romantic, chivalrous affair. The scene in the film where he shoots down a damaged Sopwith Camel over the airfield "in cold blood" never happened, and as in fact a nod to a similar scene in "The Blue Max". But the scene where the Baron is lecturing his men on "being sportsmen, not butchers" is actually true; throughout his career he tried his best to spare the enemy pilot and would shoot only to disable the aircraft and bring it down relatively intact.\n\nThe brotherly love is quite apparent if you read the Baron''s autobiography, "Der Rote Kampfflieger".

At our farm near Liaquatpur, my father saw some doves on an acacia tree. He motioned to me to grab his double barrel 12 gauge Holland & Holland shotgun and have try at the birds. Not by design but buy accident, I pulled both triggers of the gun. To this day I remember the mule kick I received in the shoulder. I wanted something that did not kick as hard as even a single barrel 12 gauge shotgun, I wanted something that was more tame.\n \nAt that time my own guns were two .177 Webleys - air rifle and air pistol. I liked both air guns. One of my cousins at that time had a bolt action 22LR. I tried his rifle and like it. As time passed, both of my air guns wore out from very heavy use. At that time they could not be repaired in Bahawalpur. When the time came for replacement, I was given a bolt action 22LR. I can recall the brand name of my air guns but for the life of me I can not recall the brand name of the 22LR rifle. I do remember that it was made in Czechoslovakia. Perhaps it was a BRNO.\n \nOver lifetime I have had many different center fire caliber rifles. My interest in those calibers peaked and waned. But, the fascination and love of the 222LR never left me. To this day it is still in me and with me.[/QUOTE]\nI love the way you have described your youth... and the area sounds familiar.', ''),

May I suggest a 22 long rifle (22LR) cartridge rifle. The 22LR is the world’s most popular cartridge. There are reasons why it is known as the Number One. \n \nIt is the cheapest brass cartridge available. It delivers almost no recoil to the shoulder. With reasonable marksmanship, it is effect up to 100 yards on small game. If later you acquire big caliber rifle, the 22LR will still serve you well. When big game season is over and you have to wait for following big game season - you can keep honing your shooting skills with the 22LR at minimal cost. The 22LR will be like your best buddy - always ready for you. Don’t forget, with a 22LR rifle your immediate and extended family members can enjoy this sport with you .\n \nYou need not spend a ton of money to get a decent 22LR rifle. You don''t have to buy a new one. There are many fine used 22LR rifles available at reasonable prices. If you have relatives or friends in this hobby, ask their assistance in keeping an eye open for a “good buy” for your need. If no one around you is in this hobby, ask member here for help. As a newcomer, members will go out of their way to assist you.\n \nNo doubt you will be excited when you get your 22LR rifle. I will be just as excited to hear from you that you acquired one.

Up until 1915-1916 there was an overwhelming sense of civility in the conduct of war. All that changed as the war became more & more bloody and as battles lasted for months with massive casualties on both sides (the Battle of Somme, 1916, lasted for almost 6 months and led to a million dead soldiers). By 1917, all semblance of civility, chivalry and honor had evaporated as all sides tried to inflict as many casualties on the enemy as possible. That led to a more & more "mechanized" form of warfare, where the tank made it appearance and machinegun began to replace the rifle as the dominant weapon of the battlefield. War stopped being a matter of martial pride, and instead inevitably turned into a human meat-grinder.\n\nIt was in this changed scenario that the Red Baron found himself. Where in 1915 combatant pilots would first openly face one another like jousting knights of old, by 1917 shooting down your opponent by sneaking up on him became the norm. Where in 1915 opponents in the air referred to themselves as "knights of the air", by 1917 air combat had been reduced to a mad dash to shoot down, and preferably kill, as many enemy pilots as possible. Where in 1915 the Red Baron was a firm believer in the spirit of martial honor, by 1917 he too had sunk to ambushing and shooting down opponents ("like a filthy jackal", as he says in his autobiography).\n\nThis transition is very vividly portrayed in "The Blue Max", where the old clique of German airmen try to adhere to the rules of class & chivalry while the newcomer (Bruno Stackel, played brilliantly by the late George Peppard) is only concerned about shooting down enough enemy aircraft to earn the prestigious "Pour l'' Merit".', ''),

All that changed as the war became more & more bloody and as battles lasted for months with massive casualties on both sides (the Battle of Somme, 1916, lasted for almost 6 months and led to a million dead soldiers). By 1917, all semblance of civility, chivalry and honor had evaporated as all sides tried to inflict as many casualties on the enemy as possible. That led to a more & more "mechanized" form of warfare, where the tank made it appearance and machinegun began to replace the rifle as the dominant weapon of the battlefield. War stopped being a matter of martial pride, and instead inevitably turned into a human meat-grinder.\n\nIt was in this changed scenario that the Red Baron found himself. Where in 1915 combatant pilots would first openly face one another like jousting knights of old, by 1917 shooting down your opponent by sneaking up on him became the norm. Where in 1915 opponents in the air referred to themselves as "knights of the air", by 1917 air combat had been reduced to a mad dash to shoot down, and preferably kill, as many enemy pilots as possible. Where in 1915 the Red Baron was a firm believer in the spirit of martial honor, by 1917 he too had sunk to ambushing and shooting down opponents ("like a filthy jackal", as he says in his autobiography).\n\nThis transition is very vividly portrayed in "The Blue Max", where the old clique of German airmen try to adhere to the rules of class & chivalry while the newcomer (Bruno Stackel, played brilliantly by the late George Peppard) is only concerned about shooting down enough enemy aircraft to earn the prestigious "Pour l'' Merit".[/QUOTE]\n\nAlas thats how war makes all men.Though war is the worst thing mankind inflicts on itself and the planet,yet all great inventions and medicine have been developed and become affordable due to war.Its the worst,most horrible and yet most beautiful thing we do and revel in.', ''),

All this, whilst saving Rs. 125K''s( Glock, 350K''s), which you again could invest in getting some accessories imported, if need be. You''ll never forget the "feel" of holding a Steyr in your hands.\n\nI''m placing the Glock in third position, because it is severely over-priced and because I personally do not feel ease of controlling it, due to the aggressive grip texture.\n\nFinally, I''m placing the Caracal at the bottom, coz it''s still a new item, with lots to establish yet.

(396520, '6.5mm Remington Magnum The 6.5mm is a Remington innovation introduced in 1966 for their Model 600 carbine. The 6.5mm Remington Magnum is based on the 350 Remington Magnum case, the only difference being in the caliber reduction. The Remington Model 600 carbine had an 18 1/2-inch barrel and the later 660 carbine a 20-inch barrel. Neither of these carbines allowed the cartridge to develop its full velocity potential and both were discontinued. By 1971, only the Remington Model 700 and 40-XB target rifle with 24-inch barrels were cataloged as available in 6.5mm Magnum caliber. for a short time, the Ruger Model 77 was offered in this caliber. At the present time, no one offers rifles chambered for the 6.5mm Remington Magnum, although Remington still loads the ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe 6.5mm Remington Magnum has greater case capacity and develops higher velocity than any of the European 6.5s. It is actually an excellent cartridge for North American big game hunting and can also double as a varmint cartridge by handloading the lighter bullets of 87 to 100 grains. Probably one reason it never achieved great popularity was because of the rifles it was offered in, which were not very appealing designs, and their short magazines required deep seating of the heavier bullets with a consequent loss in powder capacity and performance. Combined with the short barrels of the Remington Model 600 and 660 carbines, this added up to ballistics well below the 30-06 class of cartridges. In a standard action that will allow seating the heavier bullets farther out, one can nearly approach the performance of the 270 Winchester. With the proper bullet, the 6.5mm Magnum is adequate for almost any North American big game at moderate to long ranges under normal hunting conditions. Unfortunately, this is another case of a basically good cartridge that didn''t catch on. At one time, Remington offered two bullet weights, a 100-grain bullet at an advertised muzzle velocity of 3450 fps and a 120-grain bullet at 3220 fps. The older 6.5mm cartridges gained their reputation as good killers with the heavier bullets of 140 to 160 grains, and the lack of such a factory load is very likely another reason for the demise of the Remington version. Maximum performance is delivered by 4350, 4831 and H450 powders, in this cartridge, particularly with heavy bullets.', ''),

As far as I remember  I used to look for mallards towards later part of December in Nakasoo area.During this ongoing period other varieties were in abundance.Always had glorious shoots on 25th of Dec and onwards. We would stand in the boggy areas of the canal and the beaters would pull a long rope across the saroots  walking towards the guns.This would present  in coming mallards not very high  As Mallard tend to hide in the thick saroots in the day time.But beware of Boars as they are also flushed out by the rope and noise.Do carry SG/LG for them.A word of advice don''t shoot at a boar unless it is coming straight for you if you are in the bog.It is better to be on hard bank of the canal.Remember it is a Mallard Shoot and not driven Boars.

(388840, '22LR - Repeatability In all shooting situations we want repeatability. In other words we want our results on target to be same again and again. This factor of repeatability is the one that gives us accuracy. Let us look at our shooting process and see how some of the variations can show up on the target.\n \nThe rifle - You had test fired the rifle some time back and have proof on paper showing excellent results. Since then how much have you used that rifle? If you have used it a lot, can you say in all honesty that the current condition of the rifle is the same when you tested it on paper target? Perhaps, not.  Since then you may have propellant residue build-up in the chamber and the barrel. What assurance you have that that the rifle sight (iron or optical) has not been disturbed by mishandling since you did your testing?\n \nThe ammunition - Are you using the same ammunition that you used when you test fired the rifle? Is the ammunition from the same box? If not from the box, but another box, is the batch number on the ammunition box you are using now the same as the one that was imprinted on the test fire ammunition box? If the ammo is from the same box or from the same batch, has ammo you are using now been stored properly? Proper storage calls for low humidity and in mild temperature swings. If bought your ammunition one or more years ago, have you stored the ammunition where large swings of humidity and/or temperature took place? If the answer is yes, your ammunition may not behave the same as it did when you tested it sometime back. In an area like Punjab, seasonal temperature swings of about 40-45 centigrade are not uncommon. In the monsoon season, high humidity and high temperature conditions are also not uncommon.\n \nLet us assume the condition of the rifle and the ammunition is the same. What was the season and the weather condition when your rifle was tested? Is the current season and weather condition for shooting the same as when you test fired the rifle? If not, your “test bed” - the rifle-ammo-season-weather” combination is not he same. In such case, the act of repeatability may not be within reach.', ''),

(388861, 'Custom Shotgun Stock Adjustment (using shims); Custom Shotgun Stock Adjustment (using shims); AOA,\n\nWell, you might be thinking how important can a shim adjustment be, well let me tell you that a 1/2” drop in stock can change the direction your bullets/pellets by 20 inches at 40 yards.\n\nThere are two Basic reasons why you would need this adjustment:\n\n[IMG]http://archives.gunsandammo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/article_slideshow/CRW_2317.jpg[/IMG]\n\n1.       Your shotgun is looking elsewhere when you are pointing it at your target i.e. your missing because of your gun.\n2.       When you place your shotgun on your shoulder to aim and yet you need to adjust the gun once again to a line the front sight (bead). (Assuming your posture is accurate).\n\nHowever, I strongly recommend that you consult an expert marksman to point out the exact flaw in your shots and choose the right shim for you.\n\nSo here we go:\n\n[B]Disclaimer: [/B]This tutorial is for education purpose only. Any outcome resulted in practicing this will not be responsibility of the writer or platform. and you know the rest .\n\n[B]GUN USED[/B]: Hatsan escort AS (semi auto)\n[B]\nTOOLS required:[/B]\n1.       Screw driver\n2.       T type nut driver (usually a size 13mm)\n3.       Adjustable Wrench\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5964[/ATTACH][IMG]http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQEDWvSC976UKFSHaCFkDTEfaQrm_83tdAc7MDZKHw3T9ig9tiMHQ[/IMG][IMG]http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTLy_nGZQTyaQCl6okEroqUfe-nAW_OgP5aIYHWgtYPu7vHoNVIRw[/IMG]\n\n[B]\n[SIZE=4]\nSTEPS:[/SIZE][/B]\n[I]\nPlease ignore the flowery bed sheet believe me it’s not my choice :P[/I]\n\n1.       Unscrew the screws in the Buttplate (cushion) with the screw driver (as shown below)\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]5961[/ATTACH]\n\n2.       Remove the Buttplate and an [B]inside nut[/B] will appear (deep inside the stock as show below). \n [ATTACH=CONFIG]5962[/ATTACH]\n\n3.       Use the T type nut driver to unscrew it.\na.       TIP: remember the order of screws and washer being removed, also keep a note the strength with which the nuts and screws were tightened in the frist place i.e. factory default.\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]5963[/ATTACH]\n\n4.       Choosing the right Shim: This is the complicated part because it will decide whether you will improve the positioning or make it worse. Here is a little guide to choose the right shim.\na.       -5mm (-1/5”) this is raise the stock\nb.      +5mm (+1/5”) this is to lower/drop stock\nc.       Cast :  this is used to move the stock left or right.\nd.      Spacer: This is used to elongate the stock eventually lengthening the gun. This is used for many reasons e.g. you may like a longer gun… Hey I don’t know all the answers :D\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]5966[/ATTACH]\n\n5.       Place the shim between the Stock and the receiver and assemble the gun.\na.       TIP: Make sure that the stock connection rod is tightly screwed with the receiver of the gun.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5965[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]5967[/ATTACH]\n\nWell, I hope this helps you improving accuracy. Just don’t live with the Factory Stock setting in your shotgun, if you need it than get it done!\n \nBr,\nAdeel', 'Custom Shotgun Stock Adjustment (using shims)'),

Accordingly, you adjust the rear sight downward by one notch, one step or one mark.\n \nAfter adjusting the rear sight, you test fire several shots. You discover that now the impact points are too low. Your intended target point is in-between the highs and lows. What could be the reason? The answer may be in the rear sight adjustment steps or markings.\n \nMy thread &#8220;Rifle Shoots High/Low - No More Sight Adjustment Available&#8221; of April 25, 2011 under the Rifles Forum explains how you can determine the impact point change in raising or lowering the rear sight adjustment by one notch, one step or one mark.', ''),

(389013, ' Bro. it is an antique piece(if it is Original), as it seems from below information of wikipedia, should be a good choice of collectors. Antique piece are priceless...\n\n"The [B]MAB model D[/B] is a [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol"]pistol[/URL]  produced by MAB (Manufacture d''Armes de Bayonne) from 1933 to 1963 (.32  ACP) and 1982 (.380 ACP); it was inspired by the Belgian Browning [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_model_1910"]FN pistol 1910/22[/URL].  It was developed with the smaller "MAB C," also made in .32 and .380  ACP, and with which it has many parts in common. Some later examples  marked "MAB C" are actually a combination of a MAB C "slide" and barrel  with a MAB D frame; these are officially an "extended grip" MAB C but  usually called a "MAB C/D," although are not so marked. The MAB C was  primarily a civilian "pocket pistol," while the larger MAB D was  intended for police and military use.\n\n The MAB D was used by the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"]French[/URL] Army and [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_police"]military police[/URL] before and after World War II. After German forces occupied France, the MAB D was adopted for use by the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht"]Wehrmacht[/URL] (German army) during [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"]World War II[/URL];  these pistols typically have German acceptance marks stamped into the  metal. (As with other weapons, it is not uncommon to find forged German  acceptance marks on MAB Ds being sold, including incorrect acceptance  marks, incorrect placement, and marks on Type II MABs not manufactured  until after World War II.)\n Following World War II, the MAB D was used by the French military in  Indochina. In France, it was used by various French governmental  agencies, including the French local police, the "Gendarmerie" (national  police), the customs department, the "National Forest Office" and by  the "Banque de France". MAB Ds are now only used as surplus pistols for  the [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Police"]French Police[/URL],  who primarily used revolvers before 2000. As with other French  firearms, MAB Ds were also used by the military and police of the  Kingdom of Morocco, a French protectorate. In the years after World War  II, German police forces also used the MAB D.\n\n There were two MAD D versions, usually called the Type I and Type II.  The Type I MAB D was made 1933-1945 and used an external muzzle bushing  release latch in front of the trigger guard; the Type II used an  internal "bayonet" type release requiring pushing in and turning the  muzzle bushing. The MAB factory changed from the Type I to Type II  production in June 1945."\n\nAnother informative link for your consideration and Serial number checking.\n\n[url]http://forums.gunboards.com/showthread.php?60762-MAB-model-D-serial-number[/url]', ''),

Excellent share above.\n\nMay I just say, this is the way to boom one''s potential up for the gross benefit of the GDP, the way the Turk government promoted the skills of their technical faculty available, in setting up kind of small firearms industries all around the country and gave them the kind of "vendor" status of supplying parts and components to the main manufacturers - or may I say "assemblers" - who then assemble the quality manufactured items - [I]made according to individually specified requirements [/I]- and then move on to export these delights to us for the further joy.\n\nI feel this is an example that should long ago have been followed over here, if our government could have utilized the skills of our Darra region and helped those people in setting up small manufacturing units with the state of the art equipment.[COLOR=#0000cd] This would also have ridden illegal firearms to a great extent[/COLOR].\n\nI think, what you missed discussing with the Turks, or perhaps just forgot to include in your post above, that all firearms for export are then passed on to another authority like MKEK, which does the final passing of the quality standards before export permission is giving and items [I]serialized[/I]. It''s an absolutely unique set up.\n\nFinally, I feel we should discuss with some of the more popular importers over here, to get us some of the more desired Turkish items, that they somehow still haven''t pondered on to import. An example is the Sarsilmaz Rifled barrel slug autoloader, a couple of great handguns by Sarsilmaz, like the 14 shots K-45, probably also the SC model in Stoeger Cougar, which also could fill a major gap over here in reliable CC.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

The three men are charged with using single import licences of civil officials and members of sensitive agencies to execute the scheme.\nThese charges are contained in a letter sent to federal interior and commerce secretaries, chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), DG ISI, DG FIA and IG Police Punjab by one who called himself &#8216;well-wisher of Pakistan&#8217;. The Lahore customs collector is also alleged to have used his subordinate staff to harass the business rivals of Diyal in order to extract bribes running into millions of rupees.\n\nThe letter says Abbasi also used his influence to shield from prosecution his brother implicated in the smuggling case of 28kg of gold.  It goes on to allege that Abbasi, acting in tandem with his unannounced business partners, used the single import licences issued by the commerce ministry to officials of sensitive agencies for semi-automatic weapons to import lethal automatic weapons and then sell them in the open market.\n\nWhen Abbasi was contacted to get his version of the story, he called the allegations baseless and requested that these not be publicised.  Ex-MNA Ejaz Diyal pleaded ignorance about any such letter or weapons import. However, he acknowledged that he did know Abbasi.\n \n[B]Published in The Express Tribune, November 25th, 2011.\n[/B][SIZE=4][FONT="Calibri"][/FONT][/SIZE]', ''),

(389313, ' malik160,\n\nYes comparison can be made. The first question to ask: what is the intended use and distance invloved? If you want to punch holes in papers, the 22 magnum can go to 100-125-150 yards and 22 the Hornet to 200-250-275 yards. \n \nIf you want to hunt, then you need to state the intended game. Sure, 22 Hornet can outdo the 22 magnum on paper and in the field. Say, you want to hunt rabbits at a reasonable distance. The 22 magnum may kill at that distance but 22 Hornet may damage a good part of the rabbit meat. It may be ok for small boars, but bigger ones may require more "horsepower" from the barrel than the 22 Hornet can deliver.\n \nThe &#8220;22 Hornet&#8221; thread in the Ammunition Forum that Abbas started on October 31, 2011 is very informative. You will find many posts in that thread outlining features and comparisons. There, beside the 22 magnum and 22 Hornet, many other calibers are mentioned. In post #11 of that thread, Abbas gives cost comparisons.  The 22 magnum is cheaper to shoot. But, if you are thinking of 22Hornet, why not also consider 223 as the shooting cost is essentially the same. But 223 can do a lot more than the 22 Hornet.\n\nIf mind to buy is already set on the rifle make/model you mentioned and it is only available in 22LR and 22 Hornet, then you need to answer the initial question for yourself - the intended use and the distance in mind. You may want do some more thinking before pulling the money out of your pocket and handing it to the gun dealer. Whatever you decision, I would like to know the caliber you finally do select.', ''),

(389364, 'Rainbow 35 Tuning [FONT=arial black][B]Rainbow 35 Tuning. \n[/B][/FONT]\nSkill Required - PRO LEVEL i-e if you have experience with mechanical work. I am a DIY car enthusiast so it was just a walk in the park for me.\nTime required - 6 hours Approx. (would have be quicker if I did not have to go to a Lathe Shop).\n\nAfter say 800 shots, was not happy with the spring and the twang it makes when cocking and phanch sound when it fires, so i thought about replacing it myself. Though I won''t complain on power, it still was firing quite nice. I had a spare Diana 45 Spring that i got from air rifle headquarters. h[URL="http://www.airrifleheadquarters.com/catalog/item/251488/8070882.htm"]ttp://www.airrifleheadquarters.com/catalog/item/251488/8070882.htm[/URL] for 17$. Had chat with Moawia before buying Rainbow and he said it will fit. The spring is 34 coils with heavier 3.25mm wire. Already using another one in my Diana 45 for some years and it shoots consistently.\n\n[B]1st Step.[/B] Building the spring compression rig cuz main spring is under compression and there is no way you can compress it with bare hands. Got hold of 36" x 5" x 2" piece of wood. Cut two 03 inch sections using my electric jig saw to be used for ends. 36 inch minus 06 inch (2 end sections) gave me total length of 30 inches of wood. With the end sections mounted on base, effective internal length comes to 24 inches. Iron nails do not have the strength to hold these sections in place when under spring tension so I used Gimsa Adhesive (Rs. 50 bottle kinda elfy but bottle is bigger) before nailing in the end pieces. Oh i need a screwable compressing tool... So i used Honda Scissor Jack !! Clever Idea huh. If you are my type, do it yourself kinda guy, be very careful, [B]any slips may injure you[/B]. Holes on the rig are for 02 pins. \n\n2. Unscrew stock screws. Two on the sides and one thicker minus screw on the bottom (trigger guard front screw). Also remove rear sights.\n\n3. Remove the barrel lock screw then the barrel screw to remove the barrel and the cocking arm. Surprised to see cocking arm is a single unit unlike diana 45 where cocking arm goes into the cocking shoe. Holy cow there are no washers on the sides of barrel, seems like the manufacturer forgot to add those during assembly. Went to a lathe shop to have these made from metal washers. After reassembly barrel movement has become so much smoother than before. \n\n4. Place the compression tube on the rig and screw in the scissor jack till u achieve some tension. U may need a few big washers (big enough in diameter but should go inside the compression tube rather than the tube edges - may also use a piece of plastic pipe) on jack face. Exerting some pressure eases removal of pins. Gently tap 2nd last pin on the compression tube with rubber hammer and a flat faced iron nail (filed a 5 inch iron nail to get rid of its pointed tip). This will free the trigger.. remove it with care as u do not want to lose the trigger spring.\n\n5. Now remove the last pin. Be careful u r abt to experience spring tension. Holes on the rig that I had made prior to pin removal made it easier to collect pins in the pocket.\n\n6. Inspected piston and its leather seal. Hmmm. Requires some tuning. The seal is held in place with a screw (minus head) with plastic washer in the front and the rear of the piston. \n\n[B]Preparing the front piston seal washer for a tighter piston seal:[/B]\nI noticed the front plastic washer is responsible for how closely the leather seal grips on the cylinder wall and there was some space between the leather and the front plastic washer. Front seal washer sits inside the leather seal and its walls restrict leather seal pressing on the piston.  hmmm. Loose seal. Washed the front washer with petrol to remove any grease on it. Wrapped the edges with abro 1 inch paper tape (around 10 wraps) to achieve roughly 2 mm increase in diameter. Used scissor to cut of excesss tape. Applied elfy on the paper tape. Paper tape absorbs elfy and makes it as hard as plastic. With this i increased diameter of the front seal washer so as to ensure leather seal will grip tighter on the cylinder walls. Applied thin layer of depoxy on the front and rear let it dry. Filed off excess depoxy to give it a nice smooth finish. Depoxy can withstand heat much better than elfy so this light coating will help durability. \n\nCleaned the entire barrel using rolled piece of cloth. Goodness, it had metal filings inside the compression tube. The piston although very sturdy in construction but had a few rough edges. Filed those off, perhaps these metal filings in the compression tube had caused it. \n\nHad run out of spring tar so i used 3M White Grease (Lithium) on the spring and the piston behind the seal. 3M White lithium grease comes in a spray can and forms a pretty heavy slippery layer when it dries up. Ideal for lubricating metal to metal contact.\n\nApplied some silicone oil (also available at Tread Mill Shops) on the piston seal. With increase in piston seal diameter it was a bit difficult to get it inside the compression tube but it made me smile :) cuz i know it will improve compression. Once piston was in, sprayed more 3M Lithium grease inside the compression tube on the walls.  \n\nReassembled the entire gun in reverse order with a few shots of 3M White Grease on barrel washers and screw. Fired a few shots, it is a much refined airgun now but initially experienced loss in power due to tighter piston seal :). After say 30 shots it is as smooth as butter. No spring twang on cocking nor a phanch on firing, smoother barrel movement and greater cocking effort required with this new spring. [I]You may measure cocking effort by placing barrel on a house hold weighing scale (that you use for weighing yourself) and pressing the stock in an attempt to cock the airgun. This is not extremely accurate but gives a general idea of cocking effort. With previous spring i measured around 26 Lbs cocking effort. With new spring it is around 35 lbs. Let me also add that barrel now has washers therefore there is less resistance on barrel movement. This simple test with new spring and repeating it after several thousands shots shows you what condition is your mainspring. Reduced cocking effort = reduced power. [/I]\n\n[I][B]Love the heavier sound of a powerful airgun with a greater recoil ofcourse !!. \n[/B][/I]\nRecoil reminds me that I have also drilled a small hole just 2mm on the dove tail to restrict scope movement. \n\nSorry guyz I know I should have taken pictures of the entire process but greasy hands restricted my access to a camera !!\n\n[B]Disclaimer: If you want to tune your Rainbow 35 , [U]DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. There is a great risk of injury and or damaging the gun if you do not know what you are doing. Above Average Mechanical Expertise Required. [/U][/B]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6025[/ATTACH]', ''),

I personally own the Piranha-F, and believe me when I say this, you fall in love with it the moment you lay eyes on it, and start obsessing over it the moment you hold it. I bought mine almost 3 days back and haven''t been able to put it down! There''s just something about it that makes you want to pick it up, and you''ll be amazed just how instinctive it is to line up your shots. But if the Piranha-F seems a bit large for you, then go for the Canik Stingray (full frame); it''s a bit smaller than the Piranha (almost the same size as the Cougar), and works just as perfectly out-of-the-box as any other Canik. :)', ''),

(389498, ' [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nGreat thread. I too have been following (through various forums) the development of this New Russian Beauty. Interesting features and development however I would advise against trading in your MP-153s in favor of MP-155s. At least for now. Here is why:\r\n\r\n[B]Certain features really tickle my fancy:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. No more adjustable gas system (self regulating only)\r\nno more fiddling around with a very moody (and times quiet frustrating) feature of the MP-153. the system will automatically adjust to any load it is being subjected to. Kinda Cool.\r\n\r\n2. Ability to use shims to change cast and length of comb\r\nNow this is certainly interesting. a good gun fit makes one hell of a difference in the way you shoot.\r\n\r\n3. Dovetail milled on the receiver (to install a variety of sighting systems)\r\ncool feature for somebody who want to shoot slugs. a definite plus.\r\n\r\n4. Improved controls (better shaped trigger guard, mag cut-off)\r\nI kinda liked the shape of the trigger guard. mag cut-off is pretty nice as well. at times you really dont want to cycle through every cartridge just to empty the magazine. plus it gives you the option of sudden load change given the situation (hunting).\r\n\r\n5. Reduced weight\r\na big time plus\r\n\r\n[B]Things that concern me:[/B]\r\n\r\n1. New design with no history or track record\r\nwith every new product , there are bugs and issues. some of them are caught during designing, some during prototyping phase and some during serial production phase however others (the really nasty ones) reveal themselves only after years of continuous use. in short, you need some time before you can conclusively say that all kinks have been worked out. in other words: it takes a few years before a manufacturer gets everything right in a product.\r\n\r\n2. Probable design flaws that might need tweaking\r\nif you recall the history of Baikal MP-153, uptil 2005, it was plagued with a variety of issues ranging from durability to reliability and pattern performance. infact, if you compare your 2006 (or later) Baikal to a 2005 (or earlier) Baikal you will find striking differences in the shape of the barrel thread (choke system), cartridge elevator (design and shape) and bolt handle(more likely a cosmetic change only).\r\n\r\n3. No more adjustable gas system (self regulating only)\r\nThis is either a good thing or a bad thing. however given the quality and inconsistency of locally manufactured cartridges I am more comfortable with a system which I can fiddle with or adjust.\r\n\r\n[B]To Summarize:[/B]\r\n\r\nI would say that you hold on to your Baikal MP-153s for now. why? cause this new MP-155 still has a long way to go before it proves itself worthy to be called a Baikal shotgun. Something synonymous with hell and back reliability and tank like durability.\r\n\r\nRegards', ''),

I was not able to shoot the partridges in the proper way so my dad said you should get a GWARCH and hunt in a close range or monitor how the partridges move so you can see how to hunt them. I mostly used to monitor there movement and enjoy rather then hunting them. I saw the GWARCH making in front of me. Its very Simple. Take a Good piece of cloth which you think you can hide your front from it. Take Skins of the Wild Bushes, ( Chegird or Chish in balochi). The skins of this Wild bushes give a AKHROAT type color when u put them in water. Put the Cloth and these Bush Skins together to Color the Cloth.

Take a Good piece of cloth which you think you can hide your front from it. Take Skins of the Wild Bushes, ( Chegird or Chish in balochi).

(389673, 'CZ75 D Compact Competition hammer install The decocker models in CZ family are one of the most difficult pistols to handle in gun-smithing. The sear cage and decocker assemble pops open, and requires a lot of patience, skill, and patience again, to re-assemble.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the weapon I was modifying was NIB, had very tight springs and pin-holes. This meant I had to go the conventional way, let everything pop open instead of pushing longer sear pin out with a shorter slave pin. For those not aware of CZ P01 design, the sear cage pin holds the sear cage in the frame, as well as 3 different springs, sear, firing pin lifting block lever, and decocker assembly. One single pin goes through all these parts, and in the frame. A shorter slave pin will retain all the parts, while remove the sear cage from the frame to get to the hammer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U]SEQUENCE[/U]\r\n-Field strip\r\n-Remove grips\r\n-Remove main spring retaining plug and mag brake. This will lead to main spring popping out. This part can also be done after removing sear cage.\r\n-Lift sear spring and remove decocking lever\r\n-Remove washer which retains the sear cage pin.\r\n-Push out the sear cage pin. The springs and other parts will literally fly out. Make sure you have them secured. If a slave pin were used, properly, you could have an intact sear cage coming out, no fuss.\r\n-Remove the hammer pin retaining pin, and then the hammer pin (yes, a lot of pins)\r\n-Hammer and disconnector are all yours to have now! The pins attaching the hammer and disconnector to the strut do take a lot, a lot, of beating to come out. They are very well staked. They will have to be replaced, so have them in spare beforehand.\r\n-Re-assemble in reverse order.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U]TOOLS[/U]\r\n-Punch (roll pin) 1/16", 3/32" , 1/8" \r\n\r\n-Polymer hammer for smacking in the sear cage pin\r\n\r\n-Starter punch kit\r\n\r\n-The handle of the hammers for pressing down the plug, or any thing that does not damage finish, and can be used to hold/push the plug inside.\r\n\r\n-Nose pliers\r\n\r\n-Spring hook kit (to fiddle with sear spring, decocker spring, hammer retaining pin, and decocker/sear-cage pin retaining washer)\r\n\r\n-Polymer pistol block\r\n\r\n-Slave pin for decocker assembly (almost impossible to reassemble without this)\r\n\r\n-No Third Hand this time, had to use both arms and both legs during the process.\r\n\r\n-Those looking for pictures, can have a look at the youtube videos, it was more or less what I did, although it looks pretty simple in the videos, is more difficult in real life...or was it just me! I did not touch the trigger group..\r\n\r\n\r\n[video=youtube;mSOY9OvLrBg]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSOY9OvLrBg[/video]\r\n\r\n[video=youtube;IOsojk4fJss]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOsojk4fJss[/video]\r\n\r\n[U]RESULT[/U]\r\nThe trigger break was 4.5 lbs after the modification, reduced from 5 lbs prior. I expect this to go down to 4 lbs in time, as the weapon was NIB still. There was no creep after the change in hammer. Absolutely no creep. Competition level SA break, very smooth.

All through without any sort of malfunction.\r\n\r\n[U]TOTAL MODIFICATIONS ON PISTOL[/U]\r\n-Competition hammer (looks exactly standard, but has a different hook profile, to give crisp, smooth and instant break. A matching disconnector was also installed.\r\n-Reduced power springs: main spring for DA pull (13 lbs, also helps in racking slide!), firing pin spring to ensure reliable ignition with weaker main spring, and firing pin lifting block (fplb) spring to reduce creep in pre-travel, as well as trigger weight. Can almost not feel the fplb.\r\n-Night Sights by Meprolight (good news is they were spot on in the first install, did not need to readjust at all by tapping them after shooting!)\r\n-Cocobolo full checkered wood grips by CZ.\r\n\r\nFresh and clear pics later, for the time being, below should suffice (to some extent)..\r\n\r\n[U]CAUTION[/U]\r\n-I did repeated function checks. One after reassembling the sear cage with slave pin. Then again after installing the sear cage in the frame. Both times with decocking lever installed. Repeatedly. Finally, function test after complete assembly of weapon. Slide racking, trigger reset, decocking function etc. I only loaded two rounds in first magazine at the range, just in case. They went fine. Next mag was five rounds.\r\n-I do not intend to do any decocking type weapon again.

Air Rifle Headquarters\n2. Vortek\n\nAs per my understanding Vortek products are superior. \n\nI am also going to find one complete tuning kit for my new Diana 54. \n\nI shall post you my experience.

(389900, ' Depends, if the gunsmith is willing to put in time and effort in carefully dismantling, tuning and reassembling. For spring, i was compelled to order imported spring cuz the ones available in our country are unfortunately not up to the mark. \n\nMainspring is most critical for the power plant. Mettalurgy of wire is important and the wire needs to be cold rolled or else it loses its tension very quickly. When selecting air gun spring whether in pakistan or outside please give extra attention to the spring edges. Most springs show signs of heat (oxy aceytelene torch commonly called gas welding) on the edges. A coil even if it is cold rolled but any heat even on the edges (oxy aceytelene torch) destroys its ability to maintain its shape and tension after a few strokes (case with local springs). Closely inspect color changes on the spring coils especially on the ends to see signs of TORCH / Heat. Good luck with spring buying dude. \n\nIt is my habit and strongly advise to wait for the right parts before attempting any upgrade to avoid frequent dismantling. Plan, wait and do it right the very first time. Would have postponed assembly if i was stuck anywhere upto my satisfaction be it proper spring, piston seal or barrel side washers. The lathe shop did well and manufactured just the right washers for the barrel in terms of diameter and thickness, i personally measured with my digital vernier callipers.\n\nThe answer is yes, it will be upgraded if it is done right!\n\n[QUOTE=taha;228111]Thanks for this valuable upgrade info - while reading this, I''m sure I cannot try this myself, but it does spark a spark plug somewhere...\n\nWhat if I take my gun to a gun smith and ask him to put a better Diana 45 spring, and put washers anywhere needed, of course I''m going to miss all the fun but my gun will be upgraded...?\n\nThis statement is quite short but I reckon I will not be able to convey more to a gunsmith in the first place.

Dear Pak Gunners,\r\n\r\nMost of us are using SxS shotguns since ages, and there are some like me who are not too much familier with the inner mechanisms of these guns.\r\n\r\nI have two shotguns (probably both are boxlock), one is an Old German (GECADO) and the other one is English (Brimingham proofhouse). Storing the English gun full assembled is pretty easy, just open the barrel, release safety, pull both triggers, and while pulling, close the barrel, The firing pins get unloaded. \r\n\r\nThis system does not work with my GECADO, so I have to use blanks (with non-metal head to avoid rusting). \r\n\r\nIf I want to store the guns in taken down position (eg stock & barrel separate),I have no clue how to release the firing pins, so that the springs do not remain pressed while the gun is stored. It is my experience that if the firing pins are not unloaded prior to storing, and the gun is stored for a long period  of time, some guns start having troubles with their firing pins.\r\n\r\nCan someone help me out with this...\r\n\r\nLooking forward to expert''s advise....\r\n\r\n-', ''),

(390089, ' Few Questions Regarding CZ999 Usage.\n\nThere is Pistol and Revolver Selector button at the top of the Slide I saw in the pics from website of CZ. It must be to select the DA/SA mode. Question is, * When Pistol mode (SA) is selected and then the hammer is decocked using the decocker. How do the pistol behave. The first shot with a heavy trigger pull like DA and subsequent shots are in SA ? \n\n* If revolver mode (DA) is selected then when we chamber the round, does the hammer remain cocked unless we decock it manually or it gets in decock position itself ?\n\nI am asking these questions because I dont have this pistol yet. Further my concern is about the magazine.\n\n*How much an original Zastava Extra Magazine cost ( or even its available or not) ?\n\n* The NIB is supplied with how many magazines ?\n\n* How much an altered magazine cost me as brother 12Gauge in a separate thread mentioned that we can alter easily an original/desi Beretta/SIG magazine for CZ999.\n\n* There are higher capacity magazines available for original SIG P226, Like 20 rounds. Can they also be used with some alteration in this Pistol ? Or any other method of higher capacity magazines for this.\n\nBecause the primary attraction for me from Mp-446 towards CZ-999 for my first personal handgun (i am using only my dad''s Remington''s 1911,TT and Makarov and now thinking to buy one from my pocket money) is the extra magazines. I am a addicted of carrying as much as possible ammunition with my gun so in any kind of situation I should not be left with a gun with no food. Its Heavy I know but I want at least 5-6 Extra Magazines somewhere close to me. \n\n\nRegards,', ''),

(390260, 'Rainbow 35 Barrel Re Crown - Fine tuning Accuracy [B]Should have shared this before my post on tuning the airgun but better late than never.[COLOR=#ff0000]\n\nWhat is a crown?[/COLOR]\n[/B]The crown is the end of the barrel, or the place at the muzzle that has the final influence upon the bullet as it transitions to ballistic flight. One popular belief is that if the crown is not perfectly symmetrical, then one side of the pellet or bullet can exit before the other and allow escaping gas to impart a destabilizing effect on the bullet/pellet at the beginning of its path to the target. So, crowns have to be perfect.\n\nThe idea behind barrel re-crowning is to improve upon most air guns quick/cheap mass-produced production techniques which often results in a poor crown. A poor crown generally results in a gun that shoots off-center as the pellet gets hung-up on the barrel tip as it exits, pulling it to one side or another.  Perfect crowns improve accuracy.\n\n[URL]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OorpZlG28fI[/URL]\n\nI used Turtle Chrome Polish that has polishing agents. Household tootpaste can also be used. Make sure the airgun is not loaded and you use the right brass screws for it. Rounded edged ones (pictures below) not the ordinary admajee wood screws with flat heads. Screw should be just a little bigger than the muzzle. It needs to spin on the muzzle edge not inside the barrel to make a 1 to 1.5mm perfectly polished edge called the crown. Make sure ur drill machine does not have too much wobble or else u will acheive an oval crown instead of a round crown. \n\nView the video above and the pictures to see how it is done. \n\nSharing the best picture of i could get of the perfect CROWN on my Rainbow 35..with screws, and drill used. \n\n[B][I]Good Luck if you attempt to DIY !![/I][/B]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]6125[/ATTACH]', ''),

It''s just that the Kilinc 2000 has a more solid feel and is probably the closest to a CZ-75 that a handgun can be..\n\n\nIf the K2-C is a compact version of this one, certainly take it.\n\nI think it will be a little different platform than the Kilinc 2000L above, but something on the lines. I suppose it is 13 shots and a barrel length of 3.89 inches.\n\nSarsilmaz handguns are my favourite Turks, and it''s an established brand since 1880.

He never wanted to sell the pistol in the market and was truly happy to make me the new owner. I would greatly appreciate if the value of this weapon is not inquired and gauged in monetary terms, as it would spoil the timeless aroma of the comradeship which I share with my colleagues. For this I would be, and am immensely grateful in advance. \n\n   The pistol is a real pleasure to shoot, the accuracy is phenomenal. Only about 15 rounds have been fired through it by the previous owner out of a box of 50 Winchester Super Max Hollow Point .22 LR Ammo. The unfired bullets and a spare Magazine also came with it.

(390482, ' Greetings.\n \nParker-Hale and their rifles is one of my passions and a great amount of incorrect information seems to be circulating. The original company was brought out by a British company called Modular Industries and operated under the name :-\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4][B]Bremmer Arms Company[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\nwho were using the Parker-Hale factory to re-manufacture the American Springfield M1903A3 and the M1903NM rifles. In 1992 it seems they did a deal with the Gibbs Rifle Company of America to make the Parker-Hale line of bolt action rifles but this venture was a disaster and it lasted about two years. Meanwhile the Bremmer Arms Company ran into legal troubles over the import of some of their re-manufactured M1903''s into the US and as a result they shut down the company pretty damned quick to get out of the bother they had gotten themselves into.  This last bit is hear-say as so far no proof has come to light but when seeking more information about the Parker-Hale history I located a couple of ex-workers who claim to have witnessed Bremmer Arms bosses burning the records in a skip in the yard of the factory. Now the barrel making plant and tooling from Parker-Hale is still in England as the company[B] Armalon[/B] purchased it and moved it south to their own factory. \n\nWhat happened to&nbsp;the rest of the tooling from Parker-Hale I do not know but large quantities of finished parts and unfinished parts were sold off at auction to the trade some of which may have found overseas buyers. Proper UK made Parker-Hale rifles will bear the correct Birmingham proof marks. Sorry to say the stock must be removed to see them as for some reason P-H always had the applied at the bottom of the barrel with only the calibre marking on top visible. Part of your problem may stem from the fact that there were a fair number of finished rifles that were also sold off and some are still surfacing NIB still and in some not catalogued calibres. \n\nNow I cannot help about local Pakistan made copies but with the aid of the Birmingham proof marks it is often possible to date the Parker-Hale rifles. To further confuse matters Parker-Hale also did different types of finishes to their rifles depending on it''s intended market. I have seen P-H 1200''s with a matt blue finish instead of the usual high gloss blacking that Parker-Hale we noted for. The bolts could be blacked, left polished in the white of have just the rear of the bolt and handle blacked. I have not heard of nor seen any mention of Parker-Hale using chrome lined barrels. The outside of a lot of Parker-Hales rifles might be seen as of being black chromed due to the depth and gloss of the blacking but it''s just that hot dip blacking. \n\nWhile not about Parker-Hale I have a letter from BSA that tells me that they sold the centre fire production machinery and tooling to a company in Lahore in the mid 1980''s but I have never heard of it being used to make any of the rifles.', ''),

(390517, ' Bro, In my humble opinion. The Winchester SXP Defender P/A shotgun is highly overpriced for a Shotgun or Turkish origin. I am sure the dealers are charging premium from the unsuspecting customers for the Winchester name here.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that is it not a good shotgun. it could very well be a very durable and a reliable shotgun but all I am saying that it is highly overpriced. for a 50K worth shotgun there are plenty of options out there. you really should consider mossberg 500 (original or maverick). really hard guns to beat. built on a true combat platform. or.... you can always look into the Hatsan P/A line. they too are built pretty solid with all the bells and whistles.\r\n\r\nOne more thing. The Winchester SXP Defender P/A shotgun doesn''t offer much. 18 inch barrel with only bead sights only and no rifle sights. even some of the low quality Turkish Shotgun Manufacturers are offering HD shotgun with rifle sights.\r\n\r\nI always recommend: if you fancy a short barrel shotgun then make sure that it comes equipped with a rifle sight. Try hitting a man-sized target at 10 yards with a bead sight short barrel shotgun and you''ll quickly learn how easily one can miss the broad side of a barn with this kinda setup.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Barrels of an O/U or SxS converge at a known distance thus the point of impact of a slug becomes a guestimation at best. making it extremely difficult to fire slugs with any reasonable accuracy.\r\n\r\n2. the front sight is of a bead type. a setup intended for rapid aiming. as it promotes speed but at the cost of accuracy. specially the rifle like accuracy required for firing a single projectile such as a shotgun slug.\r\n\r\n3. the two barrels in an O/U or a SxS are held together by a side rib joined together by a solder (mostly cold). the recoil and vibrations caused by a slug can easily work the rib loose.\r\n\r\nwith the reasons above, an O/U can handle slugs but it is not recommended.', ''),

(629330, ' [B]Leading the Target[/B]\n \n     There are two main methods of leading the target: you either swing the shotgun to point ahead of the target by a constant “distance” or you swing it from behind the target through the target and slap the trigger just as the master eye sees the barrel go ahead of the target (hit the beak of the bird).  The first method can be called constant or sustained leading and the second is then swing-through leading. \n     Each method has its advocates.  I’ve used both and I suppose I prefer the constant lead method, perhaps because I think I understand it.  In all candor, I do not understand how or why swing leading works.  I can tell you that, for me, in some situations it has been the only way to start hitting targets.  Not understanding it doesn’t keep me from using it.\n     There is a third method.  In pull-away leading the gun is first pointed at and then pull forward of the target as the trigger is pulled.  This is another method I don’t fully understand but I have used it, once, by accident.  I was on the skeet range and messed up my timing.  The clay was getting well around me so I quickly point at it and jerked the gun forward.  As luck would have it, I powdered it!\n     Notice that, whatever method you use, the shotgun is always swung to track the target.  In fact, you must continue the swing even after you have fired in order to be sure the swing doesn’t stop before the shot load leaves the muzzle.  There is, after all, a time delay between when you form the intent to pull the trigger and when the load leaves the barrel.  Stop too early and you’ll be behind when the shot leaves the muzzle.  Keep the barrel swinging!  Stationary gunning is rifle shooting, not shotgunning.  You seldom get a shot at a bird going straight away from you.  Actually, grouse always seem to fly straight away from me but they also always manage to first put a tree in the way.  Thus, as I said, you seldom get a shot at a bird going straight away from you.\n      If you prefer to lead by a constant amount, look at the lead distance, d, in the table and think of it in terms of bird body length.  A quail is about 8” long so you would need to give it a constant lead of about two body lengths.  A grouse is about 1.15’ long so lead it by a body length and pheasants should be led by about 2/3 of a body length.  Of course, if the bird is flying faster than 25 fps you must increase the lead proportionally.  Gauging speed is best learned through much practice.\n     What if the bird is flying a path closer to you or further away than the 20 yards of the example?  The answer is that if, for example, the closest approach is 30 yards, then d in the table increase by the factor 30/20 = 1.5 but, and here’s the surprise, &#916;&#952; does not change!  Thus, leading by a constant angle rather than a constant distance should always get the job done.  If we only had a mental protractor in our heads to reference, leading a target would be pretty easy.\n     Of course, real shooting is not a simple as the example.  You never know the exact distance of closest approach; the speed of the bird and even its direction of flight are all apt to change abruptly and without notice.  Shot never travels at a constant speed and tends to slow down significantly over a 40 or 50 yard flight.  The fight path may not be level or it may pass directly over you.  All of these differences matter to some degree or other.  Fortunately, the shot string is there to hide our ignorance and errors of judgment. [SIZE=1][I]"Written by Ghalib"[/I][/SIZE]', ''),

Hamza like Faisal is also an avid RC flyer.Observe the Kite eying the plane which has encroached upon their domain.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5671[/ATTACH] [ATTACH=CONFIG]5672[/ATTACH] [ATTACH=CONFIG]5673[/ATTACH]\n\n\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]5678[/ATTACH][/QUOTE]\n\nhahaha Mr.Mehdi when I tried accessing your video this is the emssage that showed up instead lol\n\n\n[h=1]500 Internal Server Error[/h]Sorry, something went wrong.\n\nA team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched to deal with this situation.\nIf you see them, show them this information:\n\nqMY6gXmINv5qrWVeUHW7fV9d2cGyAd-PM3rohz_QymP_yw-tzkZlV0POF-Z0vnxGdeNHF-Fpxf_robkR72xNcILBJarp1jK4I5BWIL1g1uXLDxtyCrb69ir20TY-iOnRAzYBdhvNBjzyshnmQVBxZ3ucyrVFwScJ2rhpr7jhFDg69Djbihr_QfI6N1itZDVUj3xATwDBZHkAxZboxXN6GoHTxAZ7ps-5_j1S0F-2m9n1ZCas3oIPa1LWn08X_dAod5CFybKwu2nywCCA9HgLH0S5lhEY2saWEHSVBJCkrd72vGU1jwgJHCvxHdP2UncfSI73qpJaYuagtNeOTNt4rxZaxl0u1xjCKJefos48VNCCfXQdE8rZ3pTh8UTnhURmKX5FITyxp3ZRihvEWDyC_-9oiGlvZYz8dLYbbcISClaZ7vXlPkQ2fJohW0jdtbsqjI8qWVnQDbVkmCMWx9sDPaK5VVh2Ga45DPSNnpENJVa91xPYPrP-EEzaK0HY_IlBwRCChmc4B-1coHT_35rQG414fhct2qPZtFu5eESuUpDD4PQfauKp2iqvu61xJUc-ahy09nPIhjOu-ES4QvM0cAMd_iHrP4KO5KNQqq2OX6XD-wYSIt8svcFtjKOGj4TITeCjlNxDVR5piT20AAV3_XNOsmDXjDqLj9qKyahqtW_8SO7TdMRwZV4iKX5wYS7FbHEPOu363OpsrNE-sNO7BUmgm5HplOl4M0106h0tGFMcbaJUnkd7Aa_EJC8TcazeeuT5dAUSQRhJ1XY4w10_f_HSaDKjhLMxKbU_ggx-eckYhQFzQZAjug_RGceYrHAoHrhyVEhtcKqrGAPUMHPOJFrE7aCxPh_dTVIXCsVfrD45EKw5KBHY21Cl1_SN2bYzpM9WhLneJ7LSnlpm1cnMjZuXBkqz-Z2cy2zTj5f573f4je6KTed_PGWbCsE1xLdF-MIRJHTxO0ZtGxYRDnxcCqykFl_5vjO5JUWebdHt6O1UtjQKe9SgzpGsmJWTpCsRHO3D5b9uMNuyDA8qWuZROFNvXIcmZomLN7sLqms3uZxsPVyl5prLw96nCMkIoVxwMHxUTNpmQkWHJ1lm10L7BaiGroE7bcEIgYZbljwQeLFuha0Atkeau49M0fsGH-OipYTSf3GD5JMjbCEmXRbtWTzBk0-iT4OPvsR_txy2otRfaT0bMeJ7K0bWo-7DowPH7fe9co7uDcnQ_z1_6rkwoEJID21a_lNG3nH1udxQqJT2CeZsha9OPcECG1uAFTomBHjPU_YOARyyiLeGORVEN4DoXjYYd7e462eMmd9nfNwMTJstow9ThTUJ_wnZJkz5Y8MiYwvsVrHT6bHF1vTC-oc0AnnMVtg3jjDiCFPzhq5ghbw2B3R900CC1vmxVCoV-LvZvinXcKbAYOSJ9LuYbOc6tLaQhgY4qb-PiAwgmRgBJAhievFEcAZPtVk9TvYZzRRQnzoc-BZf4u59B6LpOfTQsYO4yFJB3PicabOEsNahyOa-IucNrNm4xmHmNRB-uaOGdIb_-zrpGSHufHvkL7sG8h7KEBx512dxQNu4eABRNC-IhwNQnZKf04iZP-Y0XSmyt2BW8LKeHumPbAQnW0atymMiNZHPlUwKyjEqJ_Kd97ePq3t2Z0uRwpDPORrBiTZVZD5yGswfwYJBrqdgIzJab4pHEhlAf8QZRwd484W-xlOLM0MKDlUG8ERVmKxtofWtfS4L2Xqio4px2kpowl2owIuZPrxmrX3t6eJtXQ1gB0NENPot8JjH_EkBL9-McBeCYcHdZdyKI5xRxNBmmNQugEiMA9J8yU9doc0E_J3RvINOzMQsqNRe2YAPbeoJgOzcRRhIN0dxLx-Qvv6oaXSM52j3_RkzduBnoQ3FE6t3kBaFDOee0P9V1DttJzN9sTR8wITYbEWUr0sLIRyfV9IRwnJdIttLJYvZUG7d-cqNvKUmHKtsq1YPsREXFwypDeBpFOe4peOzz5dDS6MZdfMlrfJXkOgSvzxDdSPseCCVOsWZ_Ql4QJzUougiBEkL05t9s8Pb5SBONxFXAaV4nKiTFBBxumQpc-ouVpOwyazuLoofyAKx0uPAlgo-qJjqUFSkNotDjxVnWbWkT8U_NWD1Fv_I83kOJC-Rblp4HjrTiqTHvMXFlgRUaFmmzrvj5TJ5-uaLBnB43a5SNpsnuHoZr8aR2wDVs-K7wrVY_A66R8kyVUnM2dpL2Z3o9LEgQLeQ9kXDImYL0HJVoeROxkUWqIZfsxwj53EwXbOrz7HJoFz6EEsJDkn1uwUfy-R7lxL_769dK-p2M71JNyyGQhz9iEqktYzf_mSMuiMlp3gAOzE58LhO2GdwkXOO13IiQF7e665btz8dmAydtZP6KKHV6krLxK4rrNVUzTsoAvLc7AChNtw2TAIhrXpijahrWaOTCkhHyQ-PBjFcqPiXJPJNaJZDQHd2iSoxw4J4epX-AOT7UVTzeFcQsrd0snynzKQUKVCoifxrO1hP9jDQUGOa_pjMx77_JRkHGnsnW7zWFF9vxChZh5yv8kV7eI6emHkGiaavDQYMrXe2tZDZ6lqAba9wM1XBdxzKO0UYdP4A9K4qbfjURkhLN6Il37_0bcrMFI2C96y69gBU0Hvu92aAYflWnCsmg-LCR352cZgRSiD06c_7Eehx4tJrVXDi7MTLdH53pK8Oqbdewv5mmyurfVoeSQeVq-haWq0zn1bAMAU4iIRAh8VezPl_a5Bx4mrNV3nx57ujBkghHaVTztHddU0q7-B_ivXG1TY9SGKCcjN767W8EC_BVh2i_yASSSfGAsO61MgZjTaYxoPetBOu1wdllHICD4bDLAWvMbXNn2G9ZexH7N1hc3hMhyNeGT8J_IBoyd8jwQjALOW0g5ft9dhwyOY98A7Jno5WhEs04oNhvlkZbag-XGXYwFCupWBrYYDl0gXhnlgpRY8BXmK_NkKQtW6cpTk6DDQ6Pw-ovpxFZaDY1CbHfiOLWhzqaFv5K-KW5HUdpyi1pEH8yK51xJWyKzNza8xO_2uZoVaFB4jKXAlaLQaXFLFtQ_Egh_WcU3iHtjpyPMWMv6IKZtCBopcaXV4hMhJ2-Fcj0xp-nvrIkqcD6ihu9QAW8viNBMinWtdm522isXgGeqxvXHNPOn-843VIr4xTsyzUkWliZ0QZizV7GG5ngo8PHso5iEsOwErDpjU_RQKVnyfoihbStnV8BPDe1FsXGQFQOo3pUtBUDg6fnZZf9I4dzspSX8HtKhBwFn16kaF78fYcLF4uQJoxZILV8BwSZvOMHU5haKme6a7Q6PHYc7_y6JoYoRjk7l5mtO8rtnA5J0tP0iY9vd3xV0heabqHIkjfhkNvF1Wo1aTOq9CvL1f8AvQOcssOTlQOIPUbVI-VN08WJCICbrs7c7c9S-DCJQMQFd6WQU8zUwBUdlAC_xURUek_GpTHZsQzPtaAQlmrYShAfSs7S3Z_kU03yZU8XQ0CJaslmD8zBGVeFm2KAIFZQV6f8_Ggil4N5LybwSIP2rZ1OWJPU0xVQ7jmjnUD8fhjkPuR8N0dauNPo96_ziCcNtO_hzq9X7DnwVeM0cKLBPMXaqFzVadNAKGk-QS8Id4JPKOxwcvrACbbuOtcVZPSbV4qY8QsLfY_rd_4JhgCs3lsUxcK7dKgecu1JaHHJj_RAsBmjth9NT2JzoA1IuthImrDsjluKwJWecXHoLxj-0BD37m_VlmXSoevsePPfk7qR1f0jPlw5A8Bm7_P80qMJBR2SAaUyQDfmvadbDFpe1ySH3zJk0-igb4nkf3F7d39CJGu2t1HVDOiWQ==hilarious isnt it.', ''),

(390913, 'Dry Firing, a different perspective I will start with saying that one should use snap caps, and that I am discussing the cz75b type weapons, that have a firing pin block. (please note that most weapons have copied this design, so just compare pictures with cz75b or it compact or decocker versions, including p07 duty).\r\n\r\nTheir design incorporates a cross pin to retain the firing pin in its position. This cross pin gets badly damaged by dry firing, as it is hollow in design. I was lucky I had (and have) in spare, so changed just in time. The cross pin runs across the slide, left to right, in the rear serration area (from where we hold and rack the slide), visible as a small hole in below picture. \r\n\r\nAn easy method to avoid damage while dry firing is to make a thick ball of tissue paper, place it at the base of hammer, between hammer and slide area. The cushioning should be think enough to avoid the hammer striking or contacting the firing pin. This can be ensured by using a pencil. Place the pencil in the barrel, flat side facing the firing pin. If the hammer ''strike'' makes the pencil move or fly out, the cushioning is not enough, and a thicker ball of tissue paper will be required. I have made this SOP for all my dry-firing sessions involving handguns, be it with firing pin block or without. For those wondering what is different in weapons without firing pin block, the are retained by a block at the end of the slide, instead of a cross pin, so there is no cross pin to get damaged, and snap caps alone should be enough.\r\n\r\nThe parts that do get stressed are:\r\n1. The firing pin, as it is constantly struck by the hammer during dry firing session\r\n2. Firing pin spring, which absorbs the forward motion of firing pin, and brings the firing pin back in position\r\n3. Hammer surface contacting the firing pin, usually a small dent is created, which is normal so far as no light strikes on live primers are observed\r\n4. Hammer or main spring\r\n5. Trigger return spring. Do not expect this to last over 10,000 rounds of dry firing in CZ75 models, that is the rated life, beyond that is bonus..\r\n\r\n\r\nFor glocks and wanna-be glocks, I have no idea what damage can be caused, but use a snap cap to minimize the damage.', ''),

Here in RWP, these handguns were available at one particular dealer and he himself claimed to have sold quite a few dozens of these over a couple of years. Kilinc 2000 L is available, and I personally held one in hands, in all steel also and I must say, it looked even better than mine in two-tone.\n\nYou''ll find absolutely no issues with the grips. It''s [I]pre-hogued [/I]also and it''s just about the best feel you could have of holding a handgun in your hands.\n\nBest of luck, seems more like a "hunt" over there in KCI.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

Since the manufacturing of guns sear is a part which has seen very less changes and modifications.The edges of step over sear,  when worn out, loses its strength of holding back the trigger and it is very dangerous scenario and it can fire a bullet without consent.Now in your this case ( putting tissue) is likely to wear sear prematurely and risking the life of firer.', ''),

This is Turkey''s way to gain markets, offering same stuff with slight changes and different names, ultimately, whether one or the other, the item sold is Turkish.\n\nWe know of this with Turkish shotguns also, many of those being basically Hatsan products, you find different labels for essentially the same shotgun.\n\nSame is the case with Germanica Handguns.

So why u feel that there Size number id wrong. if u wear them with thin socks. i hope there shoes sizes will be correct.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBro, as per my humble opinion and a little experience with combat boots:\r\n\r\nCombat Boots are always made a little larger (roomier, spacious) for their sizes. therefore you might be able to fit a size 8 foot in a size 7 boot.\r\n\r\nThe main reasons are (for slightly roomier shoe size):\r\n\r\n1. Soldiers are always advised to wear thick Cotton/Wool socks to minimize boot biting during long walks and fungal infection as a result of the bite. they are also advised to change their socks as often they can.\r\n\r\n2. Feet expand considerably when subjected to long walks.\r\n\r\n3. with slightly roomier boots, you can put in extra insoles such as Dr. Scholl''s, Sorbothane, spanco or Viscolas. these insoles make walking in hard boots similar to super soft joggers.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(391236, ' Bro, with your condition, my first recommendation would have been a 28 gauge but since you have already bought yourself a 12 gauge what you can do is:\r\n\r\n1. get quality recoil pad. this is extremely important. a quality recoil pad literally makes one hell of a difference. limbsaver or a kickeez.\r\n\r\n2. get a shooting vest with a pad pocket. then insert a sorbothane sheet in there to get extra recoil protection.\r\n\r\n3. shoot low recoil shotgun loads.\r\n\r\n4. get sub-gauge chamber inserts or tubes and use 28 gauge shells but that would kill the purpose of buying a 12 gauge and sub-gauge chamber inserts or tubes are expensive. it would have been a lot cheaper to buy to sub-gauge shotgun in the first place.\r\n\r\nOne of my relatives had a severe accident back in the 90s. after multiple surgeries he made full recovery however had to gave up shotguns as he simply could not fire a single shot due to recoil and pain that he used to experience (followed by numbness) in his right shoulder. he requested me to find a solution.\r\n\r\nSince low recoil loads are not available here in Pakistan so \r\n\r\n1. Bought a Kickeez recoil pad online. kickeez pads are alot heavier compared to limbsaver. heavy is good. reduces felt recoil exceptionally well.\r\n\r\n2. Bought a sheet of shoulder eez from the same website. its only a sheet of sorbothane. this sheet was then placed on the inside of this shooting vest where the recoil pad makes contact with the shoulder.\r\n\r\n3. length of pull of measure carefully and buttstock was lengthened by 2/8 inches by adding a self made spacer. I know its not much to make any real difference but a proper length of pull reduces the felt recoil considerably but at the cost of slowing the shotgun mount a little.\r\n\r\n4. increased the pitch a little after carefully viewing the pad where it made contact with the shoulder. this ensured maximum contact surface area. this also reduces felt recoil.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nhe shoots all day long now without any discomfort (associated with recoil) and the only complain that I get to hear is that the shotgun is a bit heavy. :)\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

Barrels of an O/U or SxS converge at a known distance thus the point of impact of a slug becomes a guestimation at best. making it extremely difficult to fire slugs with any reasonable accuracy.\n\n2. the front sight is of a bead type. a setup intended for rapid aiming. as it promotes speed but at the cost of accuracy. specially the rifle like accuracy required for firing a single projectile such as a shotgun slug.\n\n3. the two barrels in an O/U or a SxS are held together by a side rib joined together by a solder (mostly cold). the recoil and vibrations caused by a slug can easily work the rib loose.\n\nwith the reasons above, an O/U can handle slugs but it is not recommended.[/QUOTE]\n12gauge sir thank you vary much for your brief answer of course it is vary knowledge able for me and for other members too,', ''),
