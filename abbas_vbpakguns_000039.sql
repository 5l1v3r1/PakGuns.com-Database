As for the numbers mentioned for muzzle velocity are [b]claims[/b] by the manufacturers themselves and not an assessment by any independent 3rd party.\n\nDecision is all yours and I''ll not try to influence it in anyway but share my experience here. Among others, I have owned three Diana airguns so far, Mod. 48, 54 & 35 and still have two of them in use. Meanwhile I have used various brands available here and different types of mechanisms and pellets from plastic to solid copper & steel balls.\n\nMy limited exposure to these types have made PCPs to be my favorite for pure shooting pleasure without noise & vibration and with quickest repeating shots. The downside is their reliability and availability of seals & technical expertise. These rifles are not designed to be rugged & need extra special care while in use. These are priced among the best spring loading air rifles. Its great fun if someone owns it and you get a chance to shoot it ;-)\n\nThe reasons why I ended up always buying Diana springers even though I like PCPs are their reliability, quality & performance that are second to none.\n\nI have used 2 Shadow 1000s. One purchased from Al Sayad & other from Neela Gumbad but found it to be almost half in effective range as compared to the three Dianas I have used. Dropping a kite in its feet from 50 yrds is a dream for Shadow 1000.[/quote]\n\n\nDear TAREEN Sb, \n\nI am much obliged by your another detailed reply which sounds positive and support your views for Diana Air Rifles, I would also check and would consider your suggested models as good/batter options (if easily available) when ever i will go for shop. btw I have started searching net for possiblities/reviews of these diana 27 and 31. \n\nThanks Again for the Good Concern\n\nregards,', 0, 1, '58.65.160.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1968, 113584),

The 25th death anniversary of Waheed Murad that fell on the same day was celebrated with fanfare. They say nations which do not honour their great men cease to produce them.\n\nPakistan, for sure, has produced no scientist of Salam’s stature nor perhaps an actor of Waheed’s popularity. Whether it is serious research or playful acting, the national scene remains barren.\n\nForgotten or celebrated, Pakistan’s few great men were born of accident. In the case of Abdus Salam it was not just one but a series of accidents. More strikingly, in converting accidents into opportunities, help to Salam came not from friends but from strangers. Ironically, when the people who should have been helping him created hurdles even that opened the door to new opportunity.\n\nHaving earned every degree that he could, setting new records before he was 19, Salam’s urge to go for research abroad would have remained unfulfilled had Sir Chhotu Ram, Punjab’s revenue minister and a benefactor of the rural poor, not arranged a scholarship for him at Cambridge. That was the first accident with help coming from an unexpected quarter.\n\nAs a Cambridge wrangler (first class of the mathematical tripos) and PhD in theoretical physics, Salam came back to teach at his alma mater. He thus seemed set on a course which, with luck, would have some day made him principal of Government College unless he was persuaded to join the ICS. Then came a second accident. He had gone to Bombay to attend an international scientific conference with the permission of the principal. He defied an order to return, leaving the conference halfway, because the education minister had not approved of his participation.\n\nHe resigned rather than face the charge and went back to teach at Cambridge. Three years later he became the youngest ever professor at London’s Imperial College and fellow of the Royal Society. There he freely debated with atheist Bertrand Russell the existence of God and with Albert Einstein the Islamic view of the unity of forces.\n\nIn 1959, there was to be yet another accident. India’s high commissioner in London brought to him an invitation from Pundit Nehru to visit India. There Nehru offered him a minister’s rank at a salary he would himself name with no questions asked about money spent or wasted on particle research. Taken unawares, Salam sought time to think it over, came back and reported to President Ayub what had transpired. He declined a similar offer from Ayub, but agreed to act as his scientific adviser while remaining at Imperial College. That was the period when the foundations of Pakistan’s atomic energy commission and nuclear power plants were laid.\n\nHe also advised the president to establish an international research centre in Pakistan where scientists from across the world would meet to exchange ideas and knowledge. The finance minister opposed the plan because he felt it was tantamount to setting up a five-star hotel for Salam and his friends. Again declining an Indian offer to host the centre, whatever the cost, he founded the centre at Trieste with a major contribution coming from the Italian government. Thousands of scientists have since passed through Trieste — no less than 500 from Pakistan. The centre is now named after Abdus Salam. Surely, by now Pakistan would have been a hub of scientific research had Ayub’s finance minister not ridiculed Salam’s plan.\n\nAfter winning the Nobel Prize in 1979, Salam was not invited to his own college. He did not even figure in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s count of distinguished old Ravians. It was Pakistan’s darkest period of prejudice and intellectual sterility. By contrast when he went to Aligarh Muslim University to receive an honorary doctorate, the whole city turned up to greet him and students pushed his car for a mile to the campus. The scene at Guru Nanak University was no less exhilarating.\n\nSalam’s repeated pleas to Islamic countries to contribute just one per cent of their export earnings to a research fund went unheeded. No wonder that Salam is the only one from the Islamic world ever to have won the Nobel Prize in the physical sciences.\n\nScientists who benefited from Salam’s Trieste centre — Mujahid Kamran, Ghulam Murtaza and Pervez Hoodbhoy among them — now struggle to make up for the lost time and opportunities. A school of mathematics named after him is fast gaining recognition. LUMS too has established an Abdus Salam chair.\n\nEven the people at large are fast shedding the prejudices fostered by politicians. The scientists and citizens of today alike would go along with what Prof Ahmad Ali of Aligarh had to say in 1979: ‘Abdus Salam is not the name of a person but of a movement that seeks to wipe out poverty and ignorance. It is a movement for knowledge and wisdom, action and endurance, to restore pride in our own culture and to wage jihad against prejudice, tyranny and exploitation’.\n\nWhen Salam came to deliver the Faiz Memorial Lecture at Lahore, people wondered what a hard-nosed scientist and a romantic poet had in common. ‘We both are persona non grata in our own country,’ Salam explained. Then he showed to the audience the couplet Faiz once wrote in his own hand in Salam’s diary when they met at a foreign airport: Nisar mein teri galiyon pe ai watan keh jahan chali hai rasm key koi na sar utha ke chaley (My life is dedicated to the streets of the motherland where custom demands that no one should walk with head held high). It is a sad thought that Pakistan’s most brilliant scientist and most popular poet should have been the prime victims of that custom.\n\nFinally, here is an example of Salam’s humour and humility thrown into one. Asked whether Jhang, the village of Heer, would henceforth be known as the village of Salam, he replied: ‘Remember there is only one Heer, Nobel laureates are many.’ Indeed there are but only one came from Pakistan. When we can walk the streets with our heads held high will be the day to remember Salam and Faiz. It would not be possible without them.', 0, 1, '124.29.242.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3530, 113714),

If the one is not giving you respect then in return don’t give respect to them “simple rule, simple philosophy”[/quote]\n\nI have met most of the dealers and I have almost never been given any attitude. I window shop a lot, and have then chosen to give business to people I think rise above the rest. Most people are nice to me because I am nice to them.\n\nOnce a friend and fellow PakGunner showed surprise that the dealer let me pull the slide of the pistol...there is no surprise, I just asked nicely if they were okay with me testing it...\n\nThe "attitude problem" is sometimes both ways. I am sure a lot of times the attitude felt is only a reflection of the attitude one is carrying or showing to the dealer, and it is difficult for most people to see their own issues.\n\nI think that there is no set formula. Any relationships are built over time, and since the dealers are businessmen, they would be nicer to you if you don''t just waste their time.\n\nSo, be nice, professional and cordial, slightly reserved and also with a smile on YOUR face to find everyone only reflecting your attitude back onto you.\n\nJust my 5 cents.', 0, 1, '59.103.204.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 55, 113819),

Filled with diversity, dynamism, experience, humor and spirit of brotherhood. Here one gets to experience what pursuit of honest friendship is all about. \n\nWhile we had several senior members attending last night, we also had the pleasure of personally meeting some new members for the first time, and what a pleasure it was to get to know (though a little bit) about our brother Mangloo Ramzani - a guy with immense knowledge, energy and spirit of patriotism. An expert in his field and a true gentlemen. Sirjee, the ''amuds'' which you and BloodBath were experiencing during our session, were for us like a dive in a pool of knowledge and rich info. Sessions like those always rekindle that patriotism which we all Alhamdolillah have in our DNA. \n\nLikewise, it was a pleasure meeting and knowing brother BulletHog, Rizshu, Bilz111, the ''roaring'' Kakar, ''towering'' Gatlingun, ''mighty and magnanimous'' AbuAlHawl, MAK786, ARJ and EfKay. Though I''d earlier met Kakar and Gatlingun individually, but it was a treat to have them in our GTG and I''m sure everyone enjoyed their company as did they. Abbas'' sublime presence was like icing on the cake. His introduction during the GTG was enjoyed by all.\n\nSpecial congratulations to our brother BloodBath for being awarded the Tamgha-e-Imtiaz this week by the Chief of Army Staff himself. Sir, you''re lucky you didn''t get it during March 23rd ceremony. Would have spoilt all the pleasure and honor of getting the award. :) I salute you and brother ManglooRamzani for your dedication, commitment and patriotism. \n\nReasons for choosing Lal-Qila again included its central location, easy accessibility, food variety and suitable setting for our GTG.\n\nOne of the highlights of the evening was a ''telephonic khitaab'' by brother Denovo from Sialkot.

I am now more interested in testing most of the low end guns that most of us can afford to buy, like Turkish, Chinese and Taurus guns. That is where most members can benefit. You see many of us can not afford to buy a Glock, S&W, Colt, Kimber, H&K, Sig Sauer, CZ etc. Top quality pistols like these will mostly perform well in my opinion but in most cases are out of our reach. :)\n\n@All\nHere I must again clarify that this thread deals with the accuracy of a pistol only, worked out on absolute basis (not on comparative basis) by conducting a standard test. A very accurate pistol therefore would not always mean that it is the best gun for all purposes and a relatively less accurate pistol (I said relatively less accurate, not in-accurate) would also not mean that it is no good. One can compromise a little on accuracy for want of a conceal carry gun but having a very concealable gun with no accuracy would not be of much use. What I mean to say is that there has to be a bottom limit for accuracy and one should understand that below this standard, it would not be of much practical use to carry a handgun. \n\nAlso, when we say a [b]CC gun[/b] than it sould be a CC gun like Glock 26, H&K sk2000, Sig P239, Taurus PT111 Millennium Pro, Taurus 609, Taurus 709, Walther PPK/S, Ruger SR9 compact, CZ2025 Rami, S&W M&P9 Compact, CZ83, Beretta Bobcat etc etc. For such small guns which are obviously meant to be hidden in ones clothing, one may compromise a little on accuracy. In my personal view, if we take the standards set in this thread as a guideline, even these guns [b]should not be below 60 % or AVERAGE rating.[/b]   \n\nThan we have [b]compact size guns[/b] like Glock 19, CZ75 C, USP Compact, Beretta PX4 Storm, Stoeger Cougar, Walther P99, S&W M&P9, Canik Piranha Compact, Tanfoglio Force Compact etc. These guns are small enough to be carried on person (also called duty guns or officer models etc) but have sufficient range also to fire with fair degree of accuracy at a medium distance (like 15-20 M). Most of these guns, however, can not be properly hidden in summer clothing. In my personal view, taking the same tests as guideline, they [b]should preferably fall in minimum 70% or FAIRLY ACCURATE category. [/b]\n\nThan we have the [b]full size (Large Frame) models[/b], like Glock 17, Beretta 92fs, CZ75B, 1911 frame pistol (in large frame) of various companies, Sig P210, P226, H&K USP, Browning High Power, Baikal 446 Viking, CZ999 Scorpion, Taurus PT92/99, Canik Piranha, Kanuni S, Zigana, Tanfoglio Force and there is a large no of full size pistols. These pistols must be able to perform all types of combat tasks hence [b]should be accurate (Minimum 80%)[/b]. \n\nThan we have competition or target pistols. These pistols have just one purpose; to fire accurately. This category can be further subdivided into two. One is Precision shooting and the other is Practical / Tactical Shooting (IPSC type). [b]For precision shooting[/b], size, shape and other things are not important and every thing is homed on attaining one capability; more and more accuracy. Such pistols are carried in the box to the range and brought back in the box; no holster carry. Pistols used for precision shooting include Pardini, Hammerli, Walther GSP Expert, Ruger MkIII Competition, Browning Buckmark etc. [b]For practical / tactical shooting[/b], we need a gun which is very very accurate but at the same time can be carried in the holster also for use during range tests. Pistols include Sig P226 X6 and X5, STI Target Master and many other STI double stack 1911 models, H&K Mk 23, H&K USP Expert, Kimber Gold Match, CZ75 TS, S&W Performance Center 1911 models, Glock 34, etc etc. Some of the practical shooting pistols like Sig P226 X6, H&K Mk 23, STI Target Master, S&W I911 (6 inch barrel) are good enough for precision shooting as well. Bottom line is that [b]all competition pistols need to be exceptionally accurate[/b] and there is no compromise on high accuracy. \n\nIMHO, when we are buying a pistol, we must keep the purpose in mind for which that pistol is being bought and accordingly select an appropriate pistol. [b]Every pistol cant be good in every thing (cant be very concealable and most accurate at the same time)[/b]. Accordingly, we should also have a rough understanding that what accuracy standards do we expect from the pistol that we buy. [b]In any case, a pistol must not fall below the bare minimum accuracy level otherwise it is of little practical use.[/b] Just my two cents on the issue. :)\n\nregards', 0, 1, '203.99.174.71', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 114258),

I adopted this nick as SURVIVALISM is one of the topics I am researching now a days. I came across this term when I was looking for how to survive if things go wrong. These days we are facing alot of such issues like "The War Within", war in neighbour country, shortfall of everyday consumables and price hike like Rice, Patrol, Electricity, Atta etc. People have enough education and experience but unable to HUNT jobs. People have money but unable to start good business. So if this situation lingers on, survivalism awareness trainings will be of much benifit.\n\nABOUT ME! I am an IT and Project Management expert. I liek photography and travel a lot. Fond of "machines of excellence" including weapons, gadgets, 4x4 vehicles and Cameras. I like mountains, meadows and nature in general. Reads poetry and fiction, admires art movies, writre articles on IT, Management and Information Security and have a good collection of Sniping, Shooting movies and some excellect Training videos. \n\nThe best of my days are those which I spend with nature in mountains with my camera (missing Sony R1 that I sold last year) and backpack.\n\nCONTRIBUTION! I can and am intended to contribute as much information as I have on following topics and to learn from Seniors at this forum alot.\n\n1. Survivalism\n2. Gadgets\n3. Everyday Carry\n4.

[/quote]\n12guage Sir, thanks for the comments and support. :)\n\nNow coming to this important and interesting aspect that [b]how much accurate a CC weapon should be[/b]. General belief is that since a CC weapon is to be shot at a very close range in self defence and not for precision shooting in a competition; therefore not much of accuracy is required of a CC weapon. Agreed, that a CC weapon is neither designed to hit all bullets in the bull from 25 meter nor it is capable of doing so and only a fool would select a CC weapon for target shooting. However, how much is the accuracy that we need for a self defence fire on short ranges, is the question?\n\nThere is no mathematical answer to this question. However, one can analyse likely environment under which one will have to undertake this type of fire. It is likely to be characterised by following:-\n\n-  [b]Quick reaction[/b]; which implies a quick draw, simultaneous cocking of the gun / removal of safety, quick aiming and finally, an accurate shot. Mind you, this all is happening in a state of panic / fear which means that a firer will have very less time to aim while his heart is pounding at a speed of zillion miles per hour and still he has to be dead accurate otherwise he would not be there to curse his firing skills or inaccuracy of the gun. A firer therefore has to be well trained. But what about the gun? Can even a well trained firer with steel reflexes like to have a gun which is not accurate? Lets now see the gun part :)  \n\n-  For a while, just compare the above environment to the environment in which I carry out the tests. Absolutely relaxed, I sit on a chair, put my elbows on a table and take all the time to aim on a target which is a static target, does not move and has no capability to fire back at me. [b]During these ideal conditions, if a gun is firing 7 or 8 inches away from the point of aim from just 10 M, would you like to trust this gun during actual situation[/b] when one might be firing with a pounding heart and trembling hands. At least I would not like to have such a gun. \n\nI wish I had filmed one of the SD firing practices that Skeeter60 sahib demonstrated once we were testing different weapons. We had three targets placed at 3 ft away from each other and Skeeter60 sahib stood at 7 M with his back towards the targets. On word go, he turned around, while turning he drew his gun from holster (CZ75 in first practice and G19 in second), racked the slide, aimed and fired 2 bullets on 1st, 2 on 2nd and 2 on 3rd target. He was clocked 4.26 and 4.60 seconds for completing this complete drill (and all bullets were within 6-8 inches from the bull). That was a brilliant skill which any firer could be proud of (mind you Skeeter sahib is 63). \n\nAfter the fire I asked Skeeter60 sahib that how important is accuracy in this type of fire from short range? Can we afford to have a gun which is less accurate? He said that the weapon has to be dead accurate for this type of engagement. I would request Skeeter60 sahib to elaborate further on this..........\n\n[b]My final deduction was that even for CC, we need to have a weapon which is dead accurate in the tests from 10 M and reasonably accurate from 20 M.[/b] Mind you most of us do not have the skills that Skeeter60 sahib possess and a normal firer may expect at least double the amount of inaccuracy what has been established during the tests conducted under ideal environment.    \n\nAny views...........', 0, 1, '119.153.155.240', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 114624),

Additionally, I''d appreciate if the [b]thread[/b] used for the sewing could be in "[b]white[/b]" color.\n\nThe holster itself will be [b]plain[/b] and the belt plain as well as you describe above, bullet belt not necessary, coz it''s been my experience that after some time of usage the loops do get loose and bullets drop out. Done at 3500. If satisfied, a black one may follow.\n\nYet, one important thing, I''d still appreciate if the [b]inner[/b] could be double coated with some laminated stuff, i.e [b]artificial leather [/b] in same color as the exterior or some coudra/canvas, even "parachute" material, as to completely exclude risk of [b]leather acid[/b] during hot and humid months. That can damage the finishing of the gun.\n\nYou lined my last holster''s inner with a layer of suede, and I believe it may be protecting, for sure, but it doesn''t look quite "finished" and gives a "rough" appearance where visible even with the gun holstered. So plz see, if any of above suggestions for the inner is workable.\n\nOnce above details done and agreed, I''ll present myself at your shop, for sure, so the size of the mag could be recorded as well.

I feel bad in simple words and a bit surprised too as lighter primer indentations were heard in case of 24/7 series and never for the hammer fired 800 series. Although they were 2/72 rounds fired but still it should not happen ideally. Sir please do your pistol a favor. You will require a degreaser here in a can spray configuration. Thoroughly clear the firing pin channel with it. Let it dry out and do not oil in the firing pin channel after it. Do it before the next firing session you may have. I would not advise you to disassemble the firing pin channel altogether right now, but later if the results are not satisfactory you''ll need that too. We can then look for a bent firing pin spring, any possible obstruction such as a metal shaving or some nasty piece of sticky gunk that didnt help out with ordinary spraying of degreaser. I hope for you the ordinary spraying works out.\n\n[quote=Maximus]\nabout the double strike feature he rightly said..." Why would a gun company make such a feature??" and later answered jokingly "......unless they already know its not gonna fire right the first time! "  :D. Whatever the case 93% chances of the round going off on the second strike so its all good according to the technical brochure and practical experience.[/quote]\nThis double strike is a true feature or rather an innovation on all Taurus "DS" (double strike) models in 24/7 line of pistols. Once firing pin is released on trigger pull, it can be recocked and then released by a subsequent trigger pull which works similarly to DA pull in traditional DA hammer pistols. Instead of a hammer a striker fired system is found in all 24/7s therefore they are named as Double Strike "DS" capable. Very few handguns are able to do this. Now coming to 800 series they are hammer fired traditional Double Action/Single Action Pistols. All DA/SA pistols have ability to fire DA if the hammer is un-cocked. So in case of 800 series it nothing new it is only hyped by Taurus U.S marketing in their brochures and web sites. 800 pistol is a common DA/SA pistol indeed and it is not justified to call it a double striker. 24/7 DS models are double true strikers.', 0, 1, '119.152.24.43', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4254, 115010),

I would just like to add that in IMHO, in an effort to execute faster double taps / other rapid fire techniques, we must never overlook lessons of deliberate precision shooting which is the basic shooting skill. All rapid fire techniques are nothing but a fast execution of precision shooting (the same has been amply explained by the shooting instructor in the movie referred to by Faisji sahib).  If one is good at precision shooting, its just a matter of time that he would be a master in rapid fire as well. \n\nSeeing it from another angle, an accurate single shot is likely to produce better results than two inaccurate double taps (its better to hit one instead of missing four :) ). I don''t at all mean to say that double taps are useless and should not be resorted to. But since most of us are still in the learning stage and a double tap / other rapid fire techniques certainly appear more fascinating / devastating than a single shot, there might be a danger of overlooking the basics like focusing on front site, trigger and breathing control.

Please do join me for an angling trip during your next visit to Pakistan. I always fancy fishing in UK, lot of trouts and salmons and pikes and breams you know. Excellent place for fly fishing. Pakistan, however, is different. What I have learnt during my time spent in this hobby is that you are only a master when you know the area and waters well. In a new area, one is just like a novice, despite all his angling experience. So its better to ask from the locals and they always have something unique to tell you (this is what I always do). You see, same fish in different areas will have different eating preferences. Same bait and style don''t therefore work everywhere. Boilies and other such baits do work very well in UK for carp fishing because fish are used to them. In Pakistan, carps are more used to wheat, corn and rice oriented baits because this is what is mostly grown around the waters overhere. \nIt would be a pleasure to accompany you on a fishing trip :)', 0, 1, '119.153.58.85', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1739, 115088),

I would just like to add that in IMHO, in an effort to execute faster double taps / other rapid fire techniques, we must never overlook lessons of deliberate precision shooting which is the basic shooting skill. All rapid fire techniques are nothing but a fast execution of precision shooting (the same has been amply explained by the shooting instructor in the movie referred to by Faisji sahib).  If one is good at precision shooting, its just a matter of time that he would be a master in rapid fire as well. \n\nSeeing it from another angle, an accurate single shot is likely to produce better results than two inaccurate double taps (its better to hit one instead of missing four :) ). I don''t at all mean to say that double taps are useless and should not be resorted to. But since most of us are still in the learning stage and a double tap / other rapid fire techniques certainly appear more fascinating / devastating than a single shot, there might be a danger of overlooking the basics like focusing on front site, trigger and breathing control. In rapid fire, we do the same thing but faster. Just my two cents on the subject :)[/quote]\nAgreed. Basic bull''s eye training is important. It is like get to know session of the handgun. \nBut focussing on front site and breathing control will all be forgotten during confrontation with an intruder(s).\nThe only thing remembered will be point and shoot.', 0, 1, '115.186.66.112', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 115095),

A 9mm delivers from 300 to 460 ft lbs depending on different loadings, and barrels from 3 to 5 inches.\nPistols like the .22 deliver from about 70 to 120 ft lbs depending again on barrel lengths from 1 1/2 inch to 4 inches.\nActually multiple hits and the shot placement is more important than the muzzle energy of one bullet.\nA.22 in the head will drop any one and there are recorded cases of people having escaped and survived hits from .357 magnums in the torso.\nThere is need to align sights if one wants to deliver aimed hits in the vital areas. Please try to shoot in a timed practice at a range of only 6 yds and there will be a realisation that aiming is required and can be done in as short a time as about one second or a bit more depending on practice.\nI hope I am able to answer your question as I tried to cover all types of calibers and hand guns without going into specifics. \nA 2 inch barrel is sufficient for aiming at 10 yds but the Muzzle energy will suffer badly as there will be a big muzzle flash and blast but the bullet will have comparatively less energy. One of these days I will post  a chart giving various barrel lengths, bullet wts/ Calibers and Muzzle Energy/Velocity figures', 0, 1, '119.154.65.90', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4429, 115125),

Is it a well-known and commonly practiced shooting style?\n\nAlso, IMHO, the first step in training for CQ encounters would be to practice a smooth and fast draw with the carry weapon, loaded with DUMMY (snap caps?) bullets or of course, unloaded. Start slowly in front of a mirror, identify any possible problem spots during the draw, rectify them and then practice faster and faster draws. Then move on to practicing quick aiming combined with the draw and so on. Can this be a proper/valid approach to preparing for CS encounters?\n\nThanks.[/quote]\n\nSir you are on the ball, there is nothing like practicing in front of the mirror with the magazine removed and chamber cleared.\nHow ever for some reason I will not shoot a pistol from the hip. I am against using any weapon from the hip unless the range is like UNDER 3 yds and that also when there is no option. I have tried it and unless one practices with live ammo regularly it will result in iffy shot placement.\nCow boy shootists who earn their living shooting in circuses etc often have fine lead shot with which they blow the balloons etc shooting from the hip.

With your discussion, you hit the point right home of your weapon being only reliable and ''interesting'', if it is accurate.\n\nWhile on accuracy, I wanted to ask your opinion/experience with rotating barrels vs. browning type tilt barrels. With rotating barrels staying in the same plane while the action cycles, do they ''potentially'' promote accuracy, or at least enable the shooter to be quicker back on target after the recoil? Theoretically this makes sense, but one feels that if that were necessarily the case, there would be overwhelmingly more weapons designed with axially rotating barrels than otherwise. Your thoughts, sir?[/quote]\n\nBoth are capable of good accuracy depending on the quality of workmanship on both type of barrels.\nYou will be surprised most barrels are not straight, they have a slight bend or favour one side so although a barrel rotating on its axis appears to be more accurate it will be out of alignment with the slightest difference in barrel lock up which is sensitive to cartridge case rim thickness or head space.\nIf all barrels were straight and true all factory pistols would be perfectly zeroed on a given ammo.

I would just like to add that in IMHO, in an effort to execute faster double taps / other rapid fire techniques, we must never overlook lessons of deliberate precision shooting which is the basic shooting skill. All rapid fire techniques are nothing but a fast execution of precision shooting (the same has been amply explained by the shooting instructor in the movie referred to by Faisji sahib).  If one is good at precision shooting, its just a matter of time that he would be a master in rapid fire as well. \n\nSeeing it from another angle, an accurate single shot is likely to produce better results than two inaccurate double taps (its better to hit one instead of missing four :) ). I don''t at all mean to say that double taps are useless and should not be resorted to. But since most of us are still in the learning stage and a double tap / other rapid fire techniques certainly appear more fascinating / devastating than a single shot, there might be a danger of overlooking the basics like focusing on front site, trigger and breathing control. In rapid fire, we do the same thing but faster. Just my two cents on the subject :)[/quote]\nAgreed. Basic bull''s eye training is important. It is like get to know session of the handgun. \n[b]But focus sing on front site and breathing control will all be forgotten during confrontation with an intruder(s).\nThe only thing remembered will be point and shoot.[/b][/quote]\nIt is quite likely that one forgets about the shooting basics when the real situation comes. That is why it is said that there is no substitute to hard and continuous training. Once a drill is repeated thousands and thousands of time, it becomes one''s reflex action and that person just performs the act without even thinking about it. Hard training also helps in overcoming fear and nervousness. This is how professional soldiers are trained.

We must never overlook the basics :)\n\nEducative input from everyone. I would just like to add that in IMHO, in an effort to execute faster double taps / other rapid fire techniques, we must never overlook lessons of deliberate precision shooting which is the basic shooting skill. All rapid fire techniques are nothing but a fast execution of precision shooting (the same has been amply explained by the shooting instructor in the movie referred to by Faisji sahib).  If one is good at precision shooting, its just a matter of time that he would be a master in rapid fire as well. \n\nSeeing it from another angle, an accurate single shot is likely to produce better results than two inaccurate double taps (its better to hit one instead of missing four :) ). I don''t at all mean to say that double taps are useless and should not be resorted to. But since most of us are still in the learning stage and a double tap / other rapid fire techniques certainly appear more fascinating / devastating than a single shot, there might be a danger of overlooking the basics like focusing on front site, trigger and breathing control. In rapid fire, we do the same thing but faster. Just my two cents on the subject :)[/quote]\nAgreed. Basic bull''s eye training is important. It is like get to know session of the handgun. \n[b]But focus sing on front site and breathing control will all be forgotten during confrontation with an intruder(s).\nThe only thing remembered will be point and shoot.[/b][/quote]\nIt is quite likely that one forgets about the shooting basics when the real situation comes. That is why it is said that there is no substitute to hard and continuous training. Once a drill is repeated thousands and thousands of time, it becomes one''s reflex action and that person just performs the act without even thinking about it. Hard training also helps in overcoming fear and nervousness. This is how professional soldiers are trained.

I can''t think of any design purpose it might serve, especially on rotary barrels.[/quote]\n\nThe bending or slight favouring to one side is not by design, it is because when a barrel is made from stock steel bars these are lifted by fork trucks dumped and thrown and then these are cut into barrel size, then holes are drilled, and then the rifling is hook cut, button rifled or forged. All these steps cause a lot of stress on the barrel, although the barrels are annealed and re hardened in between all these steps cause the barrels to be slightly bent.\nMetal also has a memory, if it were bent to one side and later straightened it will favour its original angle when heated.

With use, a fairly tough spring lessens in tension significantly. I''m thinking, with a round setting off in the chamber, the bullet''s motion forward and the slide''s motion rearward start simultaneously, so how does a tighter or looser spring affect matters here, if at all?[/quote]\n\nThe main purpose of a counter recoil spring is to keep the slide locked forward and to feed and chamber and lock the slide.\nThe recoil does start once the round is fired but the slide only moves back after the bullet has exited the barrel.\nMost pistols are recoil operated, it means that as the bullet leaves the barrel the barrel and the slide move back togather  which cause un locking of the slide and then on the slide moves back alone with the remaining gas pressure extracting and ejecting the fired case and then rebounds with the power of the recoil spring to feed ,chamber and lock the slide with the barrel.\nJust take your 9mm ( make sure it is un loaded) and press its muzzle against a table and you will see that the barrel and slide move back togather a certain distance. The slightest back ward movement disconnects the trigger and the recoil operated 9mms will not fire when pressed against any thing.\nNow take a steel cleaning rod and press the breach or the slide after inserting the rod into the barrel you will see that the barrel/slide will not move back.\n Also a lose/weak  spring will result in damaging the pistol frame in the long run as the slide impact velocity will be higher. Both steel and alloy frames do crack under such circumstances.\nA tight spring can make the feeding out of time as it will make the slide return before the magazine spring can present a round at a proper angle for feeding specially when the magazine is loaded to capacity.\nI hope I have done justice to your question.', 0, 1, '119.154.74.223', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4429, 115553),

[/quote]\nThis is a very important aspect described by Skeeter sahib and it simply means that by the time we feel recoil and see the muzzle flipping up and slide moving back, the bullet has already left the muzzle. This highlights the importance of correct aim and smooth trigger control with regards to accuracy. Sometimes we un-necessarily stress on gripping a hand gun and adopting a perfect bookish stance etc. IMHO, a shot fired with even a slightly weaker grip and less ideal stance can produce better results if the aim was correct and trigger control was good. Conversely, a shot fired even with the strongest of grips and best of stances would not normally produce a good shot if the aim (focusing on front sight) was not right and trigger squeeze was not smooth. I don''t at all mean to say that one should be absolutely casual about grip and stance and that it''s not important. What I mean to say is that while shooting, those aspects that matter more should consume maximum of our attention and focus. \n\nSkeeter sahib has very elaborately covered various aspects related to mechanics of a handgun that enhance accuracy or otherwise. Just thought that discussion was getting too gun mechanics oriented so let''s discuss the subject from a slightly different angle. IMHO, generally speaking, inaccuracy in handgun fire is more because of the firer''s faults than the faulty construction of gun parts. Precision comes when we do the basics right :)\n\nWhy I am harping upon the same thing again and again. The only reason is that I know many of us do not get sufficient opportunity to improve our shooting skill. Mainly due to paucity of shooting ranges and partly due to price of ammo, we end up firing far less than what is required to become an accurate shot. In this environment, we must try to gain maximum benefit from our limited shooting practices and therefore, beginners or mediocre shooters are advised to concentrate on improving their basic shooting skills if they do not shoot very often. Advanced shooting drills, rapid fire drills etc look very fascinating / thrilling but mostly consume lot of ammo and their practice would be counter productive anyway if someone is weak in basic skills like say trigger control. Experienced shooters, however, may concentrate on any kind of drills they deem appropriate. \nThanks and regards', 0, 1, '119.153.64.179', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4429, 115649),

Precision comes one we do the basics right :)  [/quote]\n\nBro Gilani Sahab, I completely agree with you that one''s technique, more often than the mechanics of the gun are responsible for good or poor shooting. This thread is leaning heavily towards the mechanics/design/construction of handguns and I feel that is a relevant excellent resource on its own. Comments on shooting technique are missing here, true. Most respectfully, I feel that it will be beneficial (especially to a newbie like me) if there is an entirely separate thread dedicated to marksmanship and shooting techniques and best practices. It deserves a topic on it own which is not limited to handguns only. Very humbly, the way I see it, three threads might be useful to capture relevant info per thread:\n\n1- One dealing with handgun construction and mechanics (ie the current one. Brothers'' insights, experience and QA on just this will make it a hefty enough specialized topic)\n2- Marksmanship, techniques, best practices (which is not limited to handguns, but includes rifles, shotguns)\n3- Actual shooting data and comments on accuracy of specific handguns (and riles, SG separately), on which you already have a most excellent thread going\n\n[quote=Gilani]Why I am harping upon the same thing again and again.

In this environment, we must try to gain maximum benefit from our limited shooting practices and therefore, beginners or mediocre shooters are advised to concentrate on improving their basic shooting skills if they do not shoot very often.

What I am saying is that if a firer has command over the basics of handgun shooting, learning this or that or so & so drill is no problem and will take very less time, provided a shooter practices regularly.

As i said before my disagreement with Mr. Antharax''s method was just my own opinion. I have met people who in a SD situation have neither double tapped nor shot precisely, instead they bombarded their openent emptying their the whole mag in a matter of seconds. with similar results..NG victorious..BG dead. I have had the oppurtunity to practice firing with Maj Badar on his own range, and i did that keeping in mind that if ur cornered in a city like karachi, there are more than one assailent. in such a situation if u start double tapping, your actually focusing your attention on on oppenent. For that Maj Badar taught me the method (dont know what it is called) using a single shot, focusing on where to shoot, without actually aligning the sights. In the start i had a great deal of diffculity...but as i progressed, it was much easier and more practical. but ofcouse for that you have to be very focused and you have to be very well aquainted with the weapon you are using. At that time it was a .32 CZ 83 for me.

Lots of amazing information, and great to see people share their opinions. \n\nThe point and purpose of this thread was to initiate something other than stationary shooting to score points.\nThe purpose was to initiate a thread to learn and gain knowledge about an exercise in which one''s rapid response in a stressful situation, both mental and physical, comes into play. The "Mozambique Drill" (What I''ve tried to replicate here) is taught by LEA''s all over the world. Discarding it completely is a bit ridiculous. \n\nFor example, a person who is used to shooting at a competition target, is leaning more towards competitive shooting. But how does that practice and usage of ammo helps that person in a SD situation? How does that effect their mental alertness and drawing skills, if his/her life is threatened? No matter how many times a person goes through a certain amount of SD training, at the end of the day, they are at the mercy of circumstances and luck. But that doesn''t mean that one shouldn''t fully prepare themselves, does it? \n\nWhat''s the definition of double tap? " a shooting technique where two well-aimed shots are fired at the same target with very little time in between shots. " That doesn''t necessarily means that one can''t make use of double taps from waist height. WHY waist height? Because as I said in my first post, the double tap is to stun your enemy from a VERY close range, not more than 5-10 meters, which also ensures (After a little practice) that you don''t end up firing everywhere like a maniac. Controlled pair of shots to stun the enemy at a close distance is effective, and that''s where your third shot comes into play. The "Mozambique Drill" is a very useful tactic if used properly. People have been saying that "I''d rather take one well aimed shot than three shots" .... \n\nWell, if that''s the case, then I suppose that person draws his weapon, aligns his arms, looks down his sights, acquires the target, and then pulls the trigger, ALL in the heat of the moment when his life depends on it. On the other hand, when controlling your shots from waist height, one can effectively make use of their two shots in a split second in very less time, and after successfully wounding/stunning your enemy, you''ll have all the time you need to take the last and final decisive shot. (Only if the threat is not more than 5 to 10 meters away from you)\n\nAbout the points raised about going backwards, well, I have a question: [b]If a guy pulls a gun at you in a confined space or alley at 5-10 feet, are you going to move TOWARDS Him?[/b] Unless you''re planning to feel how cold his gun barrel feels against your chest, moving towards him is a BIG NO! Or if you could magically walk through walls, at that point in time, one can definitely go RIGHT through the wall by moving to the left. Basically, Hope for the best but DON''T forget to prepare for the worst. \n\nAnyway, we''ve got a LOT of theories here along with SD methods and techniques. I''d definitely love to see some of them in "Action" for the benefit of all of us. Any volunteers? :)', 0, 1, '115.167.25.87', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 115921),

As i said before my disagreement with Mr. Antharax''s method was just my own opinion. I have met people who in a SD situation have neither double tapped nor shot precisely, instead they bombarded their openent emptying their the whole mag in a matter of seconds. with similar results..NG victorious..BG dead. I have had the oppurtunity to practice firing with Maj Badar on his own range, and i did that keeping in mind that if ur cornered in a city like karachi, there are more than one assailent. in such a situation if u start double tapping, your actually focusing your attention on on oppenent. For that Maj Badar taught me the method (dont know what it is called) using a single shot, focusing on where to shoot, without actually aligning the sights. In the start i had a great deal of diffculity...but as i progressed, it was much easier and more practical. but ofcouse for that you have to be very focused and you have to be very well aquainted with the weapon you are using. At that time it was a .32 CZ 83 for me. So double tapping when you are in a situation like when you are being mugged on the streets of karachi or if you have a couple of intruders in your house, is a big NO NO.[/quote]\n\n\n\nFahadKahlid Sahab\n\nVery interesting discussion.

Lots of amazing information, and great to see people share their opinions. \n\nThe point and purpose of this thread was to initiate something other than stationary shooting to score points.\nThe purpose was to initiate a thread to learn and gain knowledge about an exercise in which one''s rapid response in a stressful situation, both mental and physical, comes into play. The "Mozambique Drill" (What I''ve tried to replicate here) is taught by LEA''s all over the world. Discarding it completely is a bit ridiculous. \n\nFor example, a person who is used to shooting at a competition target, is leaning more towards competitive shooting. But how does that practice and usage of ammo helps that person in a SD situation? How does that effect their mental alertness and drawing skills, if his/her life is threatened? No matter how many times a person goes through a certain amount of SD training, at the end of the day, they are at the mercy of circumstances and luck. But that doesn''t mean that one shouldn''t fully prepare themselves, does it? \n\nWhat''s the definition of double tap? " a shooting technique where two well-aimed shots are fired at the same target with very little time in between shots. " That doesn''t necessarily means that one can''t make use of double taps from waist height. WHY waist height? Because as I said in my first post, the double tap is to stun your enemy from a VERY close range, not more than 5-10 meters, which also ensures (After a little practice) that you don''t end up firing everywhere like a maniac. Controlled pair of shots to stun the enemy at a close distance is effective, and that''s where your third shot comes into play. The "Mozambique Drill" is a very useful tactic if used properly. People have been saying that "I''d rather take one well aimed shot than three shots" .... \n\nWell, if that''s the case, then I suppose that person draws his weapon, aligns his arms, looks down his sights, acquires the target, and then pulls the trigger, ALL in the heat of the moment when his life depends on it. On the other hand, when controlling your shots from waist height, one can effectively make use of their two shots in a split second in very less time, and after successfully wounding/stunning your enemy, you''ll have all the time you need to take the last and final decisive shot. (Only if the threat is not more than 5 to 10 meters away from you)\n\nAbout the points raised about going backwards, well, I have a question: [b]If a guy pulls a gun at you in a confined space or alley at 5-10 feet, are you going to move TOWARDS Him?[/b] Unless you''re planning to feel how cold his gun barrel feels against your chest, moving towards him is a BIG NO! Or if you could magically walk through walls, at that point in time, one can definitely go RIGHT through the wall by moving to the left. Basically, Hope for the best but DON''T forget to prepare for the worst. \n\nAnyway, we''ve got a LOT of theories here along with SD methods and techniques. I''d definitely love to see some of them in "Action" for the benefit of all of us. Any volunteers? :)[/quote]\n\n\nGood point raised by Mr Antharax regarding the faceoff in a confined space. If you are in a confined space or an alley, at 5-7 feet, in such a case i normally have my hand on my gun, the holestor top open, and in my mind, i am ready to shoot as soon as my weapon is out and facing the BG. meaning next time you are on the range try this. Stand in front of a target at 5-7 feet, draw ur weapon and as quickly as possible shoot the first round in the torso, keep ur hands steady, dont roll ur wrist, as the gun recoils fire anther round, and then using the recoil of the 2nd round fire a third one. Wen i tried this on a manequinn, my first shot hit the lady (i got it from a ladies boutique ;) ) on the lower ribs, the second was in the in the lower part of her (please excuse this word) right breast and the third hit her in the neck. do not let the gun come back to the orginal place. in the start its nerve racking bur i am those of you who try this will be amazed with the results.', 0, 1, '115.186.66.187', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 115949),

I think Laser for self defense is just one of the Hollywood fantasy, if and only if I have to use some accessory in dark then I will only use red dot (non reflective) which won''t disclose my position. But again my all time preference will be night sights. IN dark encounter keep yourself invisible or not to be located by the offender is a big plus. As the offender will also try to hide him and attack when he gets the clear shot. And attaching a laser or tactical light doesn’t give you an immediate night vision capability but it gives away your position and if the offender is hiding he will take advantage and will shoot you from a hiding position with his simple gun even before you point your laser or light to him for getting a proper shot.\n\nIncase the offender and the defender both are visible to each other in dark or low light then the good placement and quick reaction is all you need. \n\n \n[b]Laser and Tactical Light for Law Enforcement Agencies:[/b]\n\nThe Tactical Light and Lasers are mostly used by the [b]LEs or MOSTLY by SWAT teams[/b].

Most of the government or police officers [b](MOSTLY)[/b] they do not use tactical light or lasers.

As i said before my disagreement with Mr. Antharax''s method was just my own opinion. I have met people who in a SD situation have neither double tapped nor shot precisely, instead they bombarded their openent emptying their the whole mag in a matter of seconds. with similar results..NG victorious..BG dead. I have had the oppurtunity to practice firing with Maj Badar on his own range, and i did that keeping in mind that if ur cornered in a city like karachi, there are more than one assailent. in such a situation if u start double tapping, your actually focusing your attention on on oppenent. For that Maj Badar taught me the method (dont know what it is called) using a single shot, focusing on where to shoot, without actually aligning the sights. In the start i had a great deal of diffculity...but as i progressed, it was much easier and more practical. but ofcouse for that you have to be very focused and you have to be very well aquainted with the weapon you are using. At that time it was a .32 CZ 83 for me. So double tapping when you are in a situation like when you are being mugged on the streets of karachi or if you have a couple of intruders in your house, is a big NO NO.[/quote]\n\n\n\nFahadKahlid Sahab\n\nVery interesting discussion.

I disclose this for the sake of any one having curiosity to know it. :)\n\n[b]Comments:[/b]\nIt was good to feel this gun shooting in my hands for the very first time. I was surprised of the feel of it firing and cycling in my hands as it is so very much different from other pistols I have shot. This is true with every gun indeed. Evey pistol has its own character and way of behaving. It took me a while to understand how she kicked and how to grip her to get the results. I must say I''ll need a 100 round session to learn this new pistol. I had the chance to fire total 22 rounds myself and rest were fired by two of my friends. My bad, the session could not extend as I mentioned we had to move out early due to reasons.\n\nFeeding firing and ejection was flawless and without any sort of malfunctions. Firing pin intendations on primers were centered and consistent. Ejection of spent casings was very consistent that it later occured to me all the casing were lying on the ground piled in the same spot. Upon firing the 809 muzzle flip is greater than 92 clone due to lesser wait but felt recoil was surprisingly minute. I think it is due to polymer frame and grip that pistol seems to kick a lot lesser in hands. \n\nI was firing after a long period of a little more than 3 months now and more over pistol is new to me out of the box so couldnt stoke it to max but it has the potential no doubt. The consistency in accuracy (all my fault btw) story would change drastically once I get through another 100 rounds.\nPistol shot 10 O'' clock 1" higher and 2" off to left of the bulls eye. My current grip and trigger technique favors the idea to move my rear sight(drift adjustment) a bit to right few micro mm''s and point of impact will be minus 2" right on the line crossing bullseye. I was currently using Hold Over technique in sight picture. Considering the shots impact bit higher I have decided to use 6 O'' clock hold for the next time to bring POI down by 1". I hope to print on the bulls eye next time. :)\n\n[b]Target Pics:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsKfN1A][img]http://s2.postimage.org/KfN1A.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 8 rounds, 6 rounds in under 3" group @ 15 meters with 2 fliers due to variation in my technique.

And i presume 75% of us bought them for SD. But do keep in mind that unless the gun is handled by human it does not become a weapon. The greatest weapon in the world is the human being himself. i would suggest that people also go through a bit of close range hand to hand combat training also. At close range the biggest element of surprise to a BG is when to try to disarm him barehanded. i had the privilige of having a bit of this training and have put it to use a couple of times, though the oponents carried knives rather than guns, but it proved very effective. I am sure Mr Vik would be able to shed some more light on the subject since he has a military background.

The greatest weapon in the world is the human being himself. i would suggest that people also go through a bit of close range hand to hand combat training also. At close range the biggest element of surprise to a BG is when to try to disarm him barehanded. i had the privilige of having a bit of this training and have put it to use a couple of times, though the oponents carried knives rather than guns, but it proved very effective.

It''s only in Precision or Bullseye shooting where shooter has a table in front of him where he can rest / place his gun before firing a string and in between the shots. In all tactical shooting competitions, gun is in the holster and not on the table and shooter has little time to aim, shoot and move on to the next target. \nIf you have personal knowledge of some bulls eye shooter who was good at scoring points all day while standing infront of a paper target but was not proficient at drawing his gun from the holster and releasing a reasonably accurate aimed shot in quick time, than this is a different matter and akin to that shooter only. However, if the above remarks are meant to be generalised remarks for all competitive shooters than I would say that they are based on an assumption as well as gross underestimation of the capabilities of competitive shooters. How has this been assumed that competitive shooters don''t practice such basic things as drawing the gun from the holster and shooting in quick time?\n       \n\n[quote=Anthrax] Now if only they made tables for conceal and carry, we''d eliminate every threat infront of us in a second. :lol: [/quote]\n:rolleyes: Don''t understand what it means and on whom it is aimed?   \n\n\n[quote=Anthrax] Except for getting familiar with his Handgun and his weapon''s line of sight and fire, how does he manage to pull of a quick draw while moving, taking aim of a moving target, and doing all that in a situation where one''s rapid action techniques can save a persons life? One can''t learn all this by standing infront of a target all day scoring points. [/quote]\nAgain, it has been assumed that a competitive shooter would somehow overlook these important aspects.   \n\n\n\n[quote=Anthrax] Extra measures should be taken to ensure that if in a life or death situation, one''s prepared for the worst.

[/quote]\nIf it is written in any competitive shooting manual that a competitive shooter should just do competitive shooting practice and should not try to learn or practice new techniques, specially with regard to SD; then I strongly disagree with it. However, I haven''t seen such an advise anywhere. \n\nIn the end, I would say that [b]no one is saying this thing that instead of learning various handgun SD drills, one should resort to competition bulls eye shooting drills for self defence in a tight situation.[/b] These are two absolutely different things. One is for meant for SD, the other is for fun. However, I have a conviction that to become proficient in either of them, one must learn the basics shooting aspects first. If a shooter''s basic skills are strong, it''s not difficult for him to excel in any type of shooting skills / drills, may it be SD oriented tactical drills or bulls eye precision shooting. :) \n\nThanks and regards', 0, 1, '119.153.142.152', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 116203),

I dont see a reason why glock would use real copper grease unless they are expecting the thing to seize. thats the true purpose of a copper grease. its not for lubrication. it is designed to prevent seizure of nuts and bolts.\n\nsince Glock recommends that a user should break-in the gun with this grease on. I''m guessing it must be a metallic soap grease, could be aluminum oxide or could be plain lithium with some kind of additive added to it that makes it look copperish.\n\nanother way to look at it that copper grease is never recommended for steel-on-steel contact. its pointless in my opinion even to try. copper is a much softer metal to be of any use when hard surfaces are involved.\n\nanyways, the best thing about this copper colored grease is that it looked as if applied with some sort of a precision applicator and it wasn''t even smudged which shows that even the slide wasn''t racked after application. another point that tells that this truly was a virgin piece.\n\nanyways, enjoy long and safe shooting with your KK. :)\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.152.174', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4395, 116218),

It''s only in Precision or Bullseye shooting where shooter has a table in front of him where he can rest / place his gun before firing a string and in between the shots. In all tactical shooting competitions, gun is in the holster and not on the table and shooter has little time to aim, shoot and move on to the next target. [/quote]\n\nBefore discussing this further, first let me establish that I''m talking about the shooting practiced in Pakistan, not anywhere else in the world. So basically we have to keep that view in mind. Moving on to your point, Yes, I agree that there are different kinds of competitive shootings practiced in Pakistan. But even then, Tactical shooting is never a part of it. I must have been missing something so you can enlighten me on that but from what I''ve observed, in our society, the sport of shooting when it comes to handguns is quite limited. All the Gun Ranges in Pakistan have strict rules and since I''ve witnessed stories about the Lahore one, one can''t even shoot in a rapid mode. How can a person adopt the "Tactical" approach while being at a range in Pakistan? And I''m not talking about private lands because not all the people are privileged to practice shooting, privately. \n\n[quote]If you have personal knowledge of some bulls eye shooter who was good at scoring points all day while standing infront of a paper target but was not proficient at drawing his gun from the holster and releasing a reasonably accurate aimed shot in quick time, than this is a different matter and akin to that shooter only. However, if the above remarks are meant to be generalised remarks for all competitive shooters than I would say that they are based on an assumption as well as gross underestimation of the capabilities of competitive shooters. How has this been assumed that competitive shooters don''t practice such basic things as drawing the gun from the holster and shooting in quick time?[/quote]\n\nWhen we talk about competitive shooting, it''s not just limited to the people who participate in National tournaments. We have another class of people as well who''re also part of this genre simply because anyone who practices his shooting skill by firing at a numerical target, is basically aiming to shoot like a competitor. When scoring is involved, it automatically converts into a sport. But since we''re talking about Pakistan, please tell me how many threads related to tactical shooting have been opened since the conception of this forum? None. Reason? Because it doesn''t exist. We''re used to the competition side of this hobby, not survival and tactical shooting. What''s worse is that there aren''t any institutes who''re willing to share these life saving techniques with the common man. And that''s my point: When such an ideology doesn''t even exist in the first place, how can you argue that the average joe from the range is well trained to counter life threatening events? \n       \n\n[quote=Gilani]\n:rolleyes: Don''t understand what it means and on whom it is aimed? [/quote]\n\nThat was suppose to be a joke. :lol:\n\n\n[quote=Gilani] \nAgain, it has been assumed that a competitive shooter would somehow overlook these important aspects. [/quote]\n\nIt HAS been assumed because the Army is capable of providing you with a electronic CQC target room, but not to the average Joe. Exactly why almost no one here has shared any personal experience with us related to moving shooting at moving targets. \n\n\n\n[quote=Gilani]\nSure, no one stops us from doing this and  I fully appreciate your efforts in this regard. At least I stand more educated on the subject after going through this thread. [/quote]\n\nThat''s why we''re here. To take this hobby to a newer level where it doesn''t become just a Sunday afternoon entertainment.\n\n[quote=Gilani] \nIf it is written in any competitive shooting manual that a competitive shooter should just do competitive shooting practice and should not try to learn or practice new techniques, specially with regard to SD; then I strongly disagree with it. However, I haven''t seen such an advise anywhere. [/quote]\n\nI strongly disagree with that approach as well. But sadly, that''s all the majority has limited themselves to. \n\n[quote]In the end, I would say that [b]no one is saying this thing that instead of learning various handgun SD drills, one should resort to competition bulls eye shooting drills for self defence in a tight situation.[/b] These are two absolutely different things. One is for meant for SD, the other is for fun. However, I have a conviction that to become proficient in either of them, one must learn the basics shooting aspects first. If a shooter''s basic skills are strong, it''s not difficult for him to excel in any type of shooting skills / drills, may it be SD oriented tactical drills or bulls eye precision shooting. :) \n\nThanks and regards[/quote]\n\nYou''re right about that. One should definitely first learn the very basics of handgun shooting before moving on to such drills and exercises. But at the end of the day, if one''s keeping a weapon for SD, his focus should be more on the "Survival" trainings and Tactical shooting instead of scoring points. \n\nOur people buy new weapons and with their very first weapon, they prefer to keep on shooting for fun when in reality, the reason why they bought the weapon in the first place was for SD. I have a strong disagreement with such ideology and that''s why I''m a vocal supporter of practicing tactical drills (Only if they''re well aware of their weapon''s potential) which may one day save somebody''s life. Even if somebody is well experienced with their weapon, they continue to stick to one side of shooting which isn''t genuinely supposed to train one''s mind and body for stressful and life threatening situations. \n\nRegards', 0, 1, '115.167.45.217', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 116249),

Aimed fire is the mother of all type of shooting and without being able to hit where required any effort where personal/home defense is involved is fruitless.\n\n2. next follows speed and ability to deliver as many shots as possible in as little time as possible.\n\n3. many studies have been conducted over the years by different armies around the globe (kindly google and confirm) and the single most important variable that determined which side won was the number of rounds fired against the constraint "time". the side which fired the maximum number of rounds in as little time frame as possible ended up victorious.\n\n4. another interesting aspect of the those studies was that accuracy had a much lower "coeficient" as compared to the "coeficient" of number of rounds fired. which clearly suggests that accuracy is less of a determining factor than number of rounds fired or higher rate of fire if you must maximize the equation with time as a constraint.\n\n5. if you look at the behavior patterns of armies around the world you''ll see after second world war, after conducting extensive testing, armies opted/employed less accurate assault rifles instead of more accurate full size battle rifles for the sake of higher rate of fire and ability to carry more ammunition. following the same variables that popped up during testing in US, Russia and Britain.\n\n6. so with that we have established two very important variables (in the order of preference), higher rate of fire and accuracy. the preference established after extensive testing.\n\n7. during FBI studies of criminal encounters, the maximum handgun encounters occurred within 15 yards and the results clearly suggested that handgun operator should be well versed in the usage at 15 yards. I dont exactly remember the number but it was something like 95% or more.\n\n8. so with that established, now our variables are higher rate of fire, accuracy and 15 yards distance.\n\nso keeping all above points in mind, I feel that one must start off by practicing slow aimed fire at stationary targets placed at multiple distances at 15 yards or less. once mastered, the user should move on to rapid fire keeping the accuracy maintained and the shedding the time second by second while maintaining the accuracy. with this approach, the user/operator is taking into consideration all the variables established through well known studies.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. or you can ignore what i''ve written all together, get your pump action out, load it up with with your favorite [b]00 buckshot[/b] and [b]BOOM SHAKALAKA![/b] :D', 0, 1, '115.186.152.46', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 116328),

After firing a couple of magazines on target from my 9mm Norinko CF98 I returned to skeet site. Meanwhile, a guy came with KRAL repeater (Made in Turkey), collected a box and started skeet shooting. He was very good at hitting disks but his gun failed to fire every second and subsequent cartridges. When he come back, I conducted a brief chit chat and inspected his weapon. His gun was borrowed and was no properly lublicated. After first fire, bolt was held 1 cm aback and did not cock properly. I highlighted this issue. The guy was son of president of club and director of WIL. Meanwhile, his father arrived and after introduction,  revealed that [b]POF is going to launch its 9mm pistol in August 2010. Khalid Pervez was of the openion that this pistol is better than Glock & Beretta, weights around 1 kg, steel, and shall be launched in three flavours including regular, silver slide and third one engraved in gold. Launch price will be nearly PKR 80K[/b]. I argued alot on design, price and models. I told him that any price above 50k will be unacceptable to most of buyers. Reliability will be time tested after launch and you can not say anything right now. Weight is on the heavier side. I also suggested that an adjustible site version for target, laser railing, hi cap magazine and concealable layout/design is what market is seeking for in addition to reliability, accuracy and warrenty. I feel that their R & D is based upon misleading input from dealers trying to get distributorship and this is one reason of high pricing. POF/WIL is already known for its high pricing as compared to other markets and this is one cause of other organizations established their own production facilities. On pricing issue, he passed unacceptabel remarks that if people are buying beretta and glock why they will not buy POF. I think their major market focus is on security forces especially police purchases who have no issues wth price as it is from our precious tax money.

Missing any of these important aspects would result in insufficient skill level and incomplete knowledge of the subject. For example, shooting skills of a bulls eye shooter who does not practice self defence drills despite having the opportunity would always remain incomplete and would not be of great practical use. Similarly, a new shooter resorting to advanced shooting skills right at the start without having achieve sufficient mastery over basic bulls eye shooting skills would also not gain much and would end up wasting lot of ammo. Both techniques are important and both must be practiced.   \n\n\nBrother 12guage has given few very interesting observations which have added to the dimensions of the discussion and have made it more educative. While I fully agree with most part of his argument, I would like to give my views on one issue, ie, Importance of Accuracy vs Volume of Fire in quick time. Skeeter60 sahib has already given his very valuable input on the issue but I would also like to comment from a different angle ................... the purpose is to share our knowledge and learn from each other and certainly not to prove other person wrong. :)\n\n[quote=12gauge]\n3. many studies have been conducted over the years by different armies around the globe (kindly google and confirm) and the single most important variable that determined which side won was the number of rounds fired against the constraint "time". the side which fired the maximum number of rounds in as little time frame as possible ended up victorious. \n\n4. another interesting aspect of the those studies was that accuracy had a much lower "coeficient" as compared to the "coeficient" of number of rounds fired. which clearly suggests that accuracy is less of a determining factor than number of rounds fired or higher rate of fire if you must maximize the equation with time as a constraint.\n[/quote]\nSir, I would approach this argument from another angle. In my humble view the reference here is of artillery fire and not small arms fire. With artillery, rocket fire or other such area weapons, which are mostly indirect firing weapons (means the target is not visible from the weapon at the time of firing), armies used to aim at causing devastation of the area and to harass  the enemy, resulting in demoralization and destruction of enemy troops. In such an engagement, firing more rounds in less time brought better results because even if the round would land 100 M away from the intended target, it would explode and would cause some damage or destruction to enemy in the battlefield. More number of rounds in less time would not only cover the area occupied by the enemy but would give him little chance to react. Hence the army which fired more generally ended up winning a battle, but not always. I have used past tense in the above argument because we don''t see this trend exactly in the same form in the recent wars like Gulf War, US invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. [b]Nowadays, even with indirect firing weapons, the emphasis is on greater accuracy, more lethality and destruction of target with minimum possible number of hits [/b](simply because modern precision munitions are very very expensive and secondly when a weapon platform fires, it also reveals its position to opposing weapon systems and electronic instruments thereby giving them a chance to engage it, if it misses the target).  Therefore, in modern warfare, its SHOOT TO KILL OR GET KILLED YOURSELF. \n\n[b]Aimed fire or small arms fire or infantry fire, however, has always been different.[/b] Here, a soldier would only achieve results if he hits a target. If he misses a target, he misses it and the bullet hitting the ground behind the target would not explode like an artillery round. In few instances, a ricochet bullet might hit some other target but in most cases, it would be a waste. So firing a large number of bullets would not guarantee desired results if those bullets were not fired with accuracy. Skeeter sahib has given a very relevant example of Vietcong to illustrate this point. [b]In aimed fire therefore, all armies emphasise on accuracy which is demonstrated by commonly known army idioms like ''Shoot to kill'' or ''First Shot Kill'' etc etc. All army drills therefore aim at achieving perfection in first shot kill [/b] \n\nThe modern trends in weapon development, therefore, have all the emphasis on achieving more and more accuracy and the ability to cause maximum destruction to the target (lethality) with minimum possible engagements. May it be missiles, artillery guns, rockets, mortars, air platforms, machine guns, assault rifles or handguns, achieving sure first hit capability and destruction / neutralisation of the target is the aim.  \n\nI would terminate the argument here because the purpose of this thread is SD / CQC drills and not military warfare which is altogether a different and a very wast subject. [b] I would however submit that IMHO, dynamics of a SD combat between two or more individuals and a war between two armies on a battlefield are absolutely different and can not be compared. Lessons of one are generally not applicable to the other. [/b]\n\nLastly, I would say that despite my difference of opinion on certain issues with brother Anthrax, I give him full credit for starting an excellent thread which has added immensely to my understanding of the subject. Such a thread was badly needed I believe. Soon, we would see some tangible CQC input in this thread from some of our most experienced members :)\n\nThanks are regards', 0, 1, '119.153.146.134', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 116394),

Aimed fire is the mother of all type of shooting and without being able to hit where required any effort where personal/home defense is involved is fruitless.\n\n2. next follows speed and ability to deliver as many shots as possible in as little time as possible.\n\n3. many studies have been conducted over the years by different armies around the globe (kindly google and confirm) and the single most important variable that determined which side won was the number of rounds fired against the constraint "time". the side which fired the maximum number of rounds in as little time frame as possible ended up victorious.\n\n4. another interesting aspect of the those studies was that accuracy had a much lower "coeficient" as compared to the "coeficient" of number of rounds fired. which clearly suggests that accuracy is less of a determining factor than number of rounds fired or higher rate of fire if you must maximize the equation with time as a constraint.\n\n5. if you look at the behavior patterns of armies around the world you''ll see after second world war, after conducting extensive testing, armies opted/employed less accurate assault rifles instead of more accurate full size battle rifles for the sake of higher rate of fire and ability to carry more ammunition. following the same variables that popped up during testing in US, Russia and Britain.\n\n6. so with that we have established two very important variables (in the order of preference), higher rate of fire and accuracy. the preference established after extensive testing.\n\n7. during FBI studies of criminal encounters, the maximum handgun encounters occurred within 15 yards and the results clearly suggested that handgun operator should be well versed in the usage at 15 yards. I dont exactly remember the number but it was something like 95% or more.\n\n8. so with that established, now our variables are higher rate of fire, accuracy and 15 yards distance.\n\nso keeping all above points in mind, I feel that one must start off by practicing slow aimed fire at stationary targets placed at multiple distances at 15 yards or less. once mastered, the user should move on to rapid fire keeping the accuracy maintained and the shedding the time second by second while maintaining the accuracy. with this approach, the user/operator is taking into consideration all the variables established through well known studies.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. or you can ignore what i''ve written all together, get your pump action out, load it up with with your favorite [b]00 buckshot[/b] and [b]BOOM SHAKALAKA![/b] :D[/quote]\n\nAoa\nI don''t know much about shotguns.

However, the nearest modest range to Peshawar is the Islamabad Gun Club, which also happens to be one of the most expensive as far as membership is concerned. It is sad to see that with so many gun lovers and with such a large market in Peshawar and the Khyber Pukhtunkhwa in general, we still don''t have a good shooting club where members from Peshawar and neighbouring cities can practice in a decent, friendly, resourceful and safe environment. It is very difficult to maintain regular practice without such a facility. Practicing at one private pseudo range or the other doesn''t make anyone''s life any easier. It''s time we made some efforts to establish a commercial Peshawar Gun Club too, which is open to all responsible and enthusiastic gun lovers and shooters, not just the armed and security forces... [b]The purpose of initiating this topic[/b] is therefore to:\n\n(1) Discuss and share ideas on how this can be made possible\n(2) Identify potential sponsers\n(3) Identify individuals who will help and support the establishment of the club\n(4) Provide an opportunity to all those who have wanted such a facility in Peshawar to come forth and contribute in making this a reality. \n\nI have been discussing this topic with several gun lovers in Peshawar and in other cities and have always received a very positive response. I also know some people who actually want to develop a sound national shooting team... so the interest is surely there. I hope we can all collaborate in at least sharing some concrete ideas in the best interest of the sport itself and all those who want affordable and professional shooting facilities to become more common in Pakistan!\n\nI look forward to contributions on this subject from all of you...\n\nSincerely,\n\nMuhammad Kamran Khan Durrani', 0, 1, '119.153.4.73', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4480, 117001),

I have been urging others to post the results of the handguns that they possess but so far no one else has posted his results. Please ensure you follow the same standards that have been mentioned in post # 1 of this thread. It is not to say that the procedure mentioned there is the best procedure, it can be surely improved. However, we will have to redo all tests again because to see a standard performance, we must use a standard procedure every time with every handgun (with the difference of shooting from the handrest and shooting from elbows resting on a table off course, that you intend testing).\n\nFew things that you may consider. I did use the handrest also but the fire was more accurate without handrest simply because the table and chair that i use is a normal folding one. The table is around 1.5 ft higher than the chair but that is not enough. If i place the hand rest on this table than I have to bend down to aim which puts extra strain on my neck muscles which spoils the firing results. If one can manage a proper shooting bench in which the height of the rest and sitting place can be varied as per firers comfort, than it would be ok. But in the absence of a proper firing bench, I have experienced that its better to fire with elbows resting on the table and gun aligned to the eyes on a comfortable angle, not putting any extra strain on neck and shoulder muscles. Mind you, whatever you use or improvise, is to be placed at 10M first, than taken to 20M and than to 30M. :)\n\nHaving said that, as per my experience, the proportionate results of PT99 and MP446 would not change though there may be some difference in points scored by each gun everytime. ie, PT99 will fire more accurately than MP446 everytime (this is my experienced based on firing more than 2000 rounds with these two handguns).\n\nWaiting to see the results of your tests :)\nregards', 0, 1, '119.153.55.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 117026),

The gun with which you shoot bulls eye should be kept in the box with care after shooting and not in the holster. The handling of bulls eye shooting gun that would be used in competition and of a normal combat gun that you carry for SD is entirely different. Still, you will have to make slight adjustments every now and then. These adjustments are usually minor (just one odd click) but even such minor adjustments matter a lot when you are trying to place your shots withing 1 inch radius from 25M. \n\nSo don''t be bothered.

(104148, 3289, 104043, 'Sonnenkind', 2096, '', 1271935583, 'The website for Isl Gun Club doesn''t provide much insight into membership requirements/procedure. I''d like to post some of that information here which I acquired from my visit there. \n\nFirst, my newbie impression of the club is that it offers excellent, separate ranges/facilities for the following:\n1- A 10m range for air pistol and air rifle which is partially indoors\n2- A 25m pistol range with moving (turning) targets\n3- A 50m range for .22LR\n4- An excellent skeet range with two machines opposite each other ejecting skeets\n5- A trap range and finally\n6- What they call a big bore range (25m) for all gauge handguns, with paper targets as well as one set of 5 plates, where recently our brothers Dr. Zakir sahab and Moeen sahab competed and made us proud. The plates are side by side and I believe 6" diameter, though plz check me on that\n\nMembers can bring their own licensed weapons and ammo. If they don''t have such, they can rent good quality weapons (all types: hg, sg, rifle)  from the club and pay for ammo as much as shot. Generally a widish variety of local, chinese, US ammo is available for each weapon type, with prices comparable to slightly higher to those in the market. Clay skeets are available for expected price. It is a beautiful club. THE club to join in Isl/Pindi, IF it can be afforded! which brings me to:\n\n- The membership is for life @ Rs. 600,000 with a minimum monthly bill of Rs. 4,000 plus additional charges for facilities availed\n- At least two existing members should endorse you\n- There is a waiting period of a month or two where your application is considered/reviewed\n- You''re called for an interview with the top management who ultimately grant membership\n\nAs a member, you can go any day at anytime during day hours (>10 am and <5pm) to avail the facilities, and you are charged for range time used, weapon rental if availed, ammo shot if not your own, clay skeets etc. They send you a monthly bill for these that you clear at appropriate timelines.\n\nI feel that it is prohibitively expensive. Purely my own average middle class working-man impression, but I can''t join Isl Gun Club. So another option they have is that one can go as a guest of an existing member. In that capacity:\n\n- The member informs the range personnel that xyz will attend as guest\n- The guest pays for range time, Rs 4,000 per hour, even if you utilize the range for less time than that\n- Guest pays for weapon rented, ammo, skeets used, which if i recall correctly, is the same rate as members (check me on that)\n- During rush hours or days, members are given preference to guests, as fairly expected\n- Guest pays on the spot, no alignment with member''s monthly bill\n\nThis might enable one to go for at least one or two sessions in a month IF you know a willing member. But I''m not sure if this is a long term feasibility, in order to put in a reasonable amount of practice time, without there being too many variables involved.\n\nI hope this info is helpful for general documentative and comparative purposes. Members/guests of the club, please correct me on any info i might''ve gotten wrong. AND, if you don''t mind, please say who you are, and whether Isl/Pindi members could at some time accompany you to the range', 0, 1, '58.65.167.98', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4481, 117122),

I have a strong feeling we have something going here. Our efforts for the Peshawar Gun Club will not end in Peshawar, that I assure you... We will make similar efforts throughout Pakistan inshaAllah. Let''s take this as a pilot project.\n\nWith regard to hurdles, allow me to present a slightly different approach... why don''t we first discuss what the requirements for initiating such a club are and then see what ingredients we lack at present. I believe you had something similar in mind?\n\nHere goes nothing!!\n\n(1) Well to begin with, we need a strong and dedicated team (rich or not doesn''t matter ;)), it''s the effort that counts and will bring about results. For this we will need to maintain a list of Pakgun members who will volunteer to support. I shall maintain that list and keep others posted regularly.

They will need to be screened by the x-ray machine.  \n\n  \n\nAdditionally, baseball bats, bows and arrows, cricket bats, golf clubs, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks, pool cues, ski poles and spear guns are not allowed as carry-on items.  While these items are prohibited from your carry-on baggage, they may be transported to your destination in your checked baggage.  Any sharp objects in checked baggage should be sheathed or securely wrapped to prevent injury to baggage handlers and Transportation Security Officers (TSOs). \n\n  \n\nRegardless of whether an item is on the prohibited or permitted items list, TSOs have discretion to prohibit an individual from carrying an item through the screening checkpoint or onboard an aircraft if the item poses a security threat.  Therefore, TSA security screening personnel make the final decision on whether to permit items into the sterile area of the airport.  If you have any doubts, we recommend that you place your sporting equipment in your checked baggage. \n\n  \n\nFor more information on permitted and prohibited items, please our website at [url=http://www.tsa.gov]www.tsa.gov[/url]. \n\n  \n\nWe hope this information is helpful. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTSA Contact Center \n\n"\n\n\n\nany comments guys?:)', 0, 1, '119.154.119.72', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4487, 117492),

Well to cut short the discussion in between, I kept on saying that I will not pay a single penny and will take my stuff along and on the other hand she came down to 100 pounds. I clearly said that I am willing to miss the flight but then the airline would have to arrange bed and food for me as I don''t have any money\n\nIt was like 25 minutes to the flight time when the stupid lady gave up and allowed me to proceed with an angry looking face.\n\nSo with my 3 to 4 times experience at the airports, I have come to a conclusion that there are no set rules for such items and it is up to you how to talk, negotiate, explain and fight as the last resort to make things go in your favor.', 0, 1, '116.71.58.79', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4487, 117536),

First the smaller rifle which is suitable for para drops. Next is the standard rifle with a long barrel, which came to me brand new. My shooting with the scope gave me a lot of pleasure. I mounted a Weaver 3-9X 40mm scope on it and had some classic shots, including a wait for two wild boars to get in line, and dropping both in one shot stone dead. The bullet went through the chest of the first, entered the chest of the second boar, and ricocheted against the backbone, going up with the pinn…gggg familiarly heard after ricochet.  The heavy recoil tempted me to flinch. So I ultimately decided to go for a lighter rifle with low recoil, and moved over to 7 x 57.\n	I had accumulated a lot of ammunition for 303.

I am on this will share something soon inshaAllah.[/quote]\n\nWith due respect to MKKD, I dont think it will be a fruitful exercise. (if the aim is to compare results already in this thread)\n\nThe tests conducted by Gilani Sb cannot be compared by tests conducted by someone else. What I want to say is that if MKKD bro wants to test ''a'' gun using the method given by Gilani Sb, it will never hold good for comparing results which have already been published here. \n\nThere are a lot of tangibles here, like steady hands, trigger control, blinking, flinching etc. The set of variables in which Gilani Sb conducts the tests will be different than the ones in which MKKD will be doing.\n\nIf MKKD conducts the tests on a couple of guns and compare the results of his own tests, only then we can gain something good from it! \n\nThe results in this thread, in my opinion are not [b]absolute[/b], they are [b]relative[/b] (in a given set of variables) \n\nThats what I think, I would like to know what other members think, specially Gilani Sb and MKKD.\n\nRegards[/quote]\n\nDear Ramzani sahib,\n\nThank you for your feedback. You''re basically saying that the tests that Gilani sb introduced will vary from shooter to shooter (which is partly correct). You''re also stating that I should perhaps come up with my own tests since that''s the only way other members will gain more insight?\n\nI agree to some of the issues you''ve raised but also disagree with some. Here''s why... \n\nFirst, Gilani sb''s tests are for people who are familiar with guns and regularly practice shooting on paper targets. They''re not for people who''ve never held a gun in their lives before. So let me assure you, that anyone who is reasonably familiar with target shooting can conduct these tests You can shoot in the air without following the basics of handgun shooting but you definitely will miss your target by a few feet at 25 meters if you don''t follow these basics in target shooting :lol:. The method doesn''t require a professional stance of shooting such as the weaver, modified weaver or one hand stances. The factors you''ve mentioned make a much bigger difference when you''re shooting with your arms stretched out, not when you''re using solid support for your arms. The most accurate shooting position is a supported position, such as firing from a benchrest with the firearm well supported by a shooting rest or sandbags; this eliminates much of the shooter''s potential for error and will generally result in much smaller groups than firing from an unsupported position. Even for a firearm that is going to be shot offhand, accuracy testing from a machine rest will provide an idea of the ultimate attainable accuracy from a handgun. But we neither have the need or resources to go that far...\n\nSecondly, the only way we can base our decisions on these tests is if at least a few shooters with basic training try these tests on the SAME gun type and model but different firearms and locations, RANDOMLY selected. Statistically speaking, we will require at least a sample of 50 five-shot groups fired from one TYPE of weapon but different randomly selected guns of that same type, at the same distance in order to generalise accuracy results of a particular firearm type. So the science of probability and statistics demands that there be more tests of the same kind, not fewer tests of different types.\n\nThird, I have already submitted my request that the tests should be conducted using a very simple (even home-made) handgun shooting rest. We will have to change the test methodology ultimately if we want more reliable results. The sooner we incorporate this change the better...\n\nFinally, I don''t believe in ''re-inventing the wheel'', which is why I will be using the same method as Gilani sahib for now. But having said that and as mentioned before... I will also try the same tests, with the same gun using a hangun shooting rest to check the difference in results.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '119.153.3.19', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 117741),

Here, with the internal firing mechanism that''s not possible coz the moment you rack the gun to feed your chamber with the live round you intend to keep there for days/weeks/months the physical "potential energy" behind the firing mechanism stands "activated" from that moment onwards, and I fear, during a longer period of time this may to some extent or another be detrimental to the firing mechanism. :rolleyes:\n\nThe DA modes on the these Taurus guns is principally only for a [b]second strike necessity[/b] and unworkable for a first DA shot, and I have seriously contemplated for the next time around that I field-strip my gun, to try loading the ''live" round inside the barrel [b]BEFORE[/b] I reassemble it, wonder if this trick would undo my problem of the constant "tension" in the firing mechanism, or if it''s possible at all, practically, over to you! :rolleyes:', 0, 1, '119.154.129.97', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4494, 117833),

(104829, 3140, 96877, 'Mangloo Ramzani', 1827, '', 1272189288, '[quote=MKKD]\nDear Ramzani sahib,\n\nThank you for your feedback. You''re basically saying that the tests that Gilani sb introduced will vary from shooter to shooter (which is partly correct). You''re also stating that I should perhaps come up with my own tests since that''s the only way other members will gain more insight?[/quote]\n\nYou are right on the first one but totally wrong on the second. I never meant to say that you should come up with your own test (or methods). I said that if we need to gain something out of the results of your test, they have to compared with each other (or with the same brand of Gilani Sbs results), they cannot be used for comparison with other types of brands tested by Gilani Sb. I hope that this time I was clear enough to convey my concern. \n\nYes, the best thing would be if you tested all the weapons already tested, and then we compare the results, there would''nt be anything nicer than that. !\n\n[quote=MKKD]\nFirst, Gilani sb''s tests are for people who are familiar with guns and regularly practice shooting on paper targets. They''re not for people who''ve never held a gun in their lives before. So let me assure you, that anyone who is reasonably familiar with target shooting can conduct these tests You can shoot in the air without following the basics of handgun shooting but you definitely will miss your target by a few feet at 25 meters if you don''t follow these basics in target shooting :lol:. [b]The method doesn''t require a professional stance of shooting such as the weaver, modified weaver or one hand stances[/b]. The factors you''ve mentioned make a much bigger difference when you''re shooting with your arms stretched out, not when you''re using solid support for your arms. [b]The most accurate shooting position is a supported position, such as firing from a benchrest with the firearm well supported by a shooting rest or sandbags; this eliminates much of the shooter''s potential for error and will generally result in much smaller groups than firing from an unsupported position.[/b] Even for a firearm that is going to be shot offhand, accuracy testing from a machine rest will provide an idea of the ultimate attainable accuracy from a handgun. But we neither have the need or resources to go that far...[/quote]\n\nOK, here I think my post has been taken in the negative sense.\n\nI never meant to say that you are any less of a shooter than Gilani Sb. In even the fancy shooting styles you''ve mentioned above, plus the one with the shooting rest you can never eliminate two things, [b]Trigger Control[/b] and [b]Anticipation[/b], which, by the way, play their part even in arms rested mode and deffer from firer to firer. Please dont take it again in the negative sense, I''m not saying that you are a first time shooter or dont know about these things, I''m just saying that there will be a difference (the defference can be in the positive :) )\n\nTo elaborate my point further, please see post 180 above. You see Gilani Sbs tests and then Skeeter Sbs shooting result.\nWhat if skeeter sb had conducted [b]the test[/b] in the first place (as per procedure of Gilani Sb). There are no other test of CZ 75 on this thread. So if, lets say Skeeter Sb conducted the test (and I''m sure if he uses the elbow rested position the results would not detiorate) and concludes the CZ 75 as the most Accurate amongst the guns on this thread (surpassing PT92, CZ999 etc) would that be the correct judgement? Or would all the PG members gain from it or be misinformed? (I think misinformed is a strong word, but cant think of any other at this time!)\n\n[quote=MKKD]\nSecondly, the only way we can base our decisions on these tests is if at least a few shooters with basic training try these tests on the [b]SAME gun type and model but different firearms and locations[/b], RANDOMLY selected. Statistically speaking, we will require at least a sample of 50 five-shot groups fired from one TYPE of weapon but different randomly selected guns of that same type, at the same distance in order to generalise accuracy results of a particular firearm type. So the science of probability and statistics demands that there be more tests of the same kind, not fewer tests of different types.[/quote]\n\nI really couldnt catch what you''re trying to say here. Almost all of the tests have been on 9mm, less the one at post 181 on a .22. But I do agree the same tests have to be repeated by more members to reach some [b]"statistical"[/b] conclusion.\n\n[quote=MKKD]\nThird, I have already submitted my request that the tests should be conducted using a very simple (even home-made) handgun shooting rest. We will have to change the test methodology ultimately if we want more reliable results. The sooner we incorporate this change the better... [/quote]\n\n+1 :D\n\n[quote=MKKD]\nFinally, I don''t believe in ''re-inventing the wheel'', which is why I will be using the same method as Gilani sahib for now. But having said that and as mentioned before... I will also try the same tests, with the same gun using a hangun shooting rest to check the difference in results.[/quote]\n\nWaiting for the results, anxiosly.

However if u load up with 8 - 9 rounds i think that would do the trick for you but it would be in vicinity of 55k to 62k depending upon your bargaining skills. But if you fancy a 9mm I would suggest you go for either a stoeger or yavuz compact mc or yavuz bora light. All of them are reliable weapons.

He and the members who go with him there should repeatedly make that dealer aware of the community which PakGuns represent and make sure that any member who visits this particular dealer gets the same (or even better) rates when he introduces himself as PG member.\n\nWe should ensure that dealers know who we are and that we are INFORMED and know when we are being taken for a ride.

Those who can not sleep for them it is a torture. \n               Sleep is a physiological state. It is a complex biological phenomenon; which is after thousends of years of research\nyet, it remains a mystery. First mentioned  by Hypocretes  2500 hunderds yeras ago in his writting and prescribed hypnotics and prayer to God of sleep "Hypnosis", the father of modern medicine.  Indian Yervadec medicne described it as a curse to man kind, inducing sleep by meditation and  sleep medications asuch as Banhg and opium. nothing is full proff.\n                        What causes insomania, well several reasons  that we now understand and several reasons are still uncovered. Sleep is a rhythm  cycle called circadian rhythm which is controled by a"Master Clock" located somewhere in our barin. It has 25 hours rather than 24 hours/day.  Sleep is divided into 4 stages: Haalf awake and hale sleep, secondly,light sleep, thendeep sleep, last stage is deepest sleep; difficult to awaken. The last stage mimic total paralysis of major muscles. This happens 90 minutes after the initial stage. Put to gatgher these 4 stages called Non Rapid eye movement.\n                          Those who has sleep problem they do not go through these stages or just sleep for 9 or ten minutes and then wide awake. So what cause this disease? There are are two major reasons. Either it is Psychlogical such as obsessve compelsive, schizophernia, depression, mania, generalized anxiety (nervousness), hyper activness, unreasonable excessive worries, over stressed. The treatment is various medications given by the expert doctor, meditation such as Namaz, exercise 6 hours before going to bed, nicotine and caffine restriction, no alcohol, if can not sleep within the 15 minutes, get up and go to other room, lastly objective therapy to replace dysfunctional attitude about sleep,adaptive substituties and correct unrealistic expactations.\n               For biological problems such as cancer, angina, asthma,chronic pain, which causes insomania the treatment is availble but i`s  beyond the scope of this artical.[/quote]\n\nAoa \nBro, you are discussing medical issues.

However, I would like to comment on few concerns that you have raised. \n\n-  [b]Safety[/b]. Well, its a personal preference in my view (means standards of safety differ from person to person). But are you always going to room around with a round in the chamber and safety on? Personally speaking, I only do this when there is a likely danger. In most cases, its not required and therefore, I just keep a loaded magazine in because it just takes a second to rack the slide and get your pistol ready to fire. Yes, while traveling in a car, you might like to keep a round in the chamber and than put the safety / decocker on and keep the gun handy in an IWB holster clipped with the car door pocket. In that position, I would personally prefer a decocker so that I just push the hammer back with my thumb while I am straightening my hand and get ready to fire. So please analyse the likely use with regard to safety before you select or discard a pistol due to improper safety mechanism. If you always live in a state of danger, a Glock like pistol with no manual safety is a better option. \n\n-  [b]Bluing getting off / Scratches[/b]. Every bluing will go off sooner or later and every pistol will get few scratches also if it used regularly. So do not bother too much about it. If you intend keeping your handgun locked in a box always, the finish would last for a longer duration and vice versa. SS finish in my view has longer life. It also has great advantage during cleaning because all dirt particles / residues are clearly visible and its easy to clean that way. \n\n-  Fahad sahib has mentioned that CZ999 is a sure weapon and Taurus weapons have mixed reviews. Well, we are talking about PT92/99 and not Taurus pistols in general. There is lot of difference in Taurus striker fired pistol (9 mm) and Taurus hammer fired pistols. I am yet to hear a negative thing about PT99 or PT92. I have personal experience of firing more than 2000 rounds with PT92 and 99. [b]Not even once, I experienced any FTF or FTE issues.[/b] Same goes for CZ999, never any stoppages. With Stoeger, I have experienced occasional failures to feed, but not often or on a alarrming rate. In accuracy, PT92/99 is the best and in ease of carriage, CZ999 and Stoeger are almost the same (CZ999 is slightly longer but relatively lighter and thinner. Stoeger is slightly shorter but wider and heavier than CZ999. Conclusion, one cant hide both :) ) \n\nPlease keep one important thing in mind. If one is proficient at gun handling and is a reliable shot, even a lesser pistol  will deliver during the time of need. If one is not good at these two things, even the best pistol in the world does not have the capability to automatically aim and fire. This means one has to practice a lot and for practice one needs ammo and lots of it. Here, i would support SA sahib that whatever you buy, please ensure that you buy enough ammo for practice, at least 250-300 rounds.\n\nAnother thing is feel and balance. Please go to the market and have a feel of these weapons. Than make your own decision :) \nregards and happy buying.', 0, 1, '119.153.56.84', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4498, 118379);

Barring follow through/trigger reset, for which there would actually need to be a proper discharge to cycle the weapon, one can practice all of these without the need to actually be on a firing range. Live fire, whether for sport, competition, hunting or hd/sd of course is the real thing for which dry fire is but one practice regimen of many. You can see the importance of dry fire if you can practice sight alignment, sight picture, breathing and trigger control without disrupting sight alignment in your own home at no expense at a time of your choosing. Also with the help of a partner you can identify and work at some of the flaws in your technique safely, flinching for instance, which might otherwise not become apparent if the weapon actually recoils off a real discharge. I don''t suppose i need to mention that safety while doing dry practice at home is paramount. Lock real ammo elsewhere. Verbally tell yourself ''dry practice'' starts now. Follow a planned practice session. When done, tell yourself ''dry practice has ended now'' and not a single trigger pull for practice after that.\n\nCompetitive shooters frequently practice dry firing drills and there are manuals dedicated to doing it right from credible and bona fide instructors and schools\n\n2- Detriments, first to your shooting skill, are of course that this isn''t the complete picture. You will never develop the feel of the proper gripping strength and shooting rhythm unless your body becomes aware of what it needs to do to manage recoil, re-acquire target, reset trigger and be ready for follow up shots. So don''t develop muscle memory or practices that don''t include real live fire dynamics\n\nDetriment to your weapon is possible damage to the firing pin mechanism. Now there has been a lot of argument on this matter and as far as i have been able to gather, it isn''t completely conclusive one way or the other. I''m afraid i haven''t read much about rifles and shotguns in this regard so i''ll limit the following to handguns. The general sentiment seems to be that most modern center fire pistols should be safe to dry fire, because the firing pin doesn''t hit anything on an empty chamber. Some say that this should especially be true because some pistols, Glocks for a prime example, are ''required'' to fire dry as a part of field stripping them so it should be safe. Others say that they have dry fired their guns 1000s of times and never broken the firing pin or damaged the firing mechanism etc and I believe there is merit on all these accounts.\n\nThe argument from the other side is that it is actually the part of the firing pin that hits the inside of the breach block to stop it going beyond a certain point on an empty chamber that is susceptible to damage. ie not the end of the firing pin that strikes the primer (which in dry fire will really not hit anything). Some have reported that this part over time starts to wedge into the opening through which the firing pin extends for strike and as a result the pin doesn''t retract. They would then need to physically push the pin back to dislodge it from behind the breach face. Some people say the firing pin weakens at this place of repeated strike and the weapon becomes unreliable, causing many FTFs. Rarely, but surely people also say that the firing pin breaks at this point. Some manufactures insist and state in manuals for their guns that dry firing will damage it, use snap caps (Stoeger cougar manual, for instance, which i''ve read myself). I''d be inclined to follow the manual! I''m not sure about spring based snap caps but i''m inclined to think that just strike-stoppage at the required place should do the trick, based on the physics that seems to be involved here. Afterall, the 9mm snap cap is the same dimensions as a regular 9mm round and that has no spring padding, only strike stoppage and retraction by design.\n\nIn the end, wherever i''ve read on this matter, there isn''t a conclusion whether dry fire is safe for ALL handguns or unsafe for ALL handguns. I''m sure individual designs will to a greater or lesser degree or perhaps not at all be affected by this. Try to understand the firing mechanism of your own gun to reason out whether it should be detrimental or not\n\n3- Countermeasure for shooting technique, be aware of exactly where dry fire is beneficial and what part of your overall technique it develops and especially that it DOES NOT develop. ie put it in its proper perspective as part of a much larger whole\n\nCountermeasure for avoiding undue damage to your weapon - simply, use snap caps! Even IF damaging one''s weapon is a myth, or this doesn''t apply to all guns/ manufacturers, I''d come to this conclusion for myself and my weapon for sure, because the added advantages of snap caps are:\n- Practicing administratively loading/unloading your gun safely in your home (safety always paramount)\n- Simulating all types of malfunctions and practicing clearing them safely\n- (Dont kill me.. yet) Mixing live rounds with snap caps on the range so some1 watching can trick you into firing a dud and seeing whether you flinch.

That is to say when a person wants to carry a gun for self defence yet does not want anyone to know that he is carrying a gun (unless he is physically searched or closely inspected), would carry a gun which is small enough to be concealed. If this statement is true than IMHO, it implies that in CC, size of foremost importance. Equally important is the reliability, accuracy (up to 7-10 m only) and potency. \n\nLets take them one by one. \n\n[b]Size[/b]. What should be the ideal size for CC. Well, that might differ from man to man. Obviously, a gun which would be too large to be concealed by a 5''6" man of skinny built might be a very concealable gun for a man of say 6''5" height and a heavy built. Also, during winters, even a large gun can be concealed but during summers in warm areas, it may be difficult to conceal a much smaller gun. However, in our part of the world where the weather is mostly warm rather hot and average built is not very large, we would need a comparatively smaller gun for CC. IMHO, a gun of less than 6.5 inches length (163 mm) and 1.2 inches width (30 mm) is bare minimum for conceal carry. Any thing smaller would be a bonus. Moreover, the gun should not be too heavy also. Max of 750 gm weight may be taken as standard, lesser the better. \n[b]\nReliability[/b]. A CC gun, which would mostly be used at closer ranges under life threatening environment, has to be absolutely reliable. No compromise on this. Any gun that is ammo sensitive is strongly not recommended, no matter how small it may be. \n\n[b]Accuracy[/b]. General understanding is that since a CC gun is to be used in self defence at very short ranges, it does not need to be a very accurate one and even a less accurate gun would do. I disagree with this line of thinking. IMHO, a CC gun is to be used for a very very serious business, ie, saving ones life. It has to be dead accurate at 7-10 M at least. That is why we see that all good CC guns like Sig P239, Glock 26, Kahr K9, Kahr MK9, HK 2000sk, Ruger SR9, Walther PPK etc are dead accurate at 7m, capable of making a 2-3 inches group from this distance. If a gun makes say 7-8 inches group away from the bull from 7-10 m distance, it cant be trusted at a time when the heartbeat is likely to be 120 and hands might be trembling. In such conditions, most normal human beings would not be able to fire as accurately as they do during routine range practices. So one can''t relegate accuracy at any cost. IMHO, the only difference in the accuracy expected of a range gun and of a CC gun is of distance. A good range gun makes a 2-3 inch group at 25-30 M, a good CC gun does the same up to say 10 M, that''s it. With an inaccurate range gun, one is likely to loose a match. With an inaccurate CC gun, one may end up losing his life :(\n\n[b]Potency[/b]. A CC gun must have good stopping power. It is said that shot placement is what matters. Agreed. However, preferably one should be using such ammo that even if he misses the vitals, the target is neautralised to a great extent. I would therefore not recommend a caliber smaller than .380 ACP or 9x18mm Makarov for CC. 9x19 parabellum would be better. .45 ACP would have a very potent stopping power but would also increase the overall weight and decrease the overall capacity.

The American Eagle brand name is the low cost line of ammunition manufactured by Federal, one of the largest U.S. ammo companies. American Eagle ammo generally gives good performance for value priced "shooter grade" ammunition.\nThis commercial load has several advantages over the original military loading. The original military load used corrosive Berdan primers. Not only did that make the round non-reloadable, it also required that the pistol be cleaned promptly after use to keep the corrosive primers from damaging the barrel.\nThe American Eagle load, in contrast, uses U.S. standard Boxer primers and brass cases. This allows the emtpy cases to be reloaded economically for reuse. The Boxer primers are also non-corrosive so prompt cleaning, while always a good idea, is no longer absolutely required.\nThe American Eagle 9x18mm Makarov load does differ from the original military load in bullet weight. While the original specification was for a 95 gr bullet, this load uses a 90 gr bullet instead.\nIn practical use I have tried both the original military loads and the 90 gr American Eagle loads side by side and can not detect any real difference. The point of aim for both loads seems to be within an inch or so of each other at 15 yards and, if anything, the American Eagle load seems to have slightly softer recoil.\nI have used the American Eagle load in an East German Makarov and in a Bulgarian Makarov and it has worked well in both. That is more then I can say for another popular 9x18 Makarov commerical load currently imported from Russia.\n"', 0, 1, '119.154.5.211', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4507, 118563),

It can prevent the development of a flinch, or cure an existing one. It is more convenient than going to the range and allows you to practice basic gun manipulations without burning ammo unnecessarily. It allows you to build up thousands of repetitions of attaining perfect sight alignment, a perfect trigger squeeze and a complete follow through, without the expense of firing thousands of rounds while doing it. \n\nDry firing is a convenient way to marry the trigger finger with the rest of the body. It is better than actual shooting in one respect -- it allows you to see exactly the sight picture and sight alignment without the interference of recoil or muzzle blast.\n\n[b]To do or not to do > Damage aspect[/b]\n\nMost modern centerfire handguns are not going to be damaged by dryfire. If in doubt about yours, inquire the manufacturer. For Taurus manufactured firearms, I found the answer right from their own website [url]http://www.taurususa.com/faq-results.cfm?faqID=24[/url] > Qs. Can I dry fire my Taurus? Ans. Yes, except for the .22 caliber pistols which includes models 94 and 941. .22 caliber revolvers such as models 94 and 941 also should not be dry fired.\n\n[b]Countermeasures > SnapCaps[/b]\n\nStill doubtful / confused about dry-firing related damage myth ?

Most other handguns available in Pakistani market come with manual safeties. \n\nHowever, this statement does not give a complete picture and does not prove that CZ999 is an unsafe pistol to carry. As I have already mentioned in some other thread, the notion of safety in my personal view is more on mental than physical plane. It means different to different people. One person may feel the need of fool proof safety while another person might say that safeties are just an irritant and may delay / jeopardize the reaction of firer when he needs to act fast.  After all, Glock does not have a manual safety and Sig P226, one of the best pistols ever manufactured, also does not have a manual safety rather just a decocker. And mind you, these two are amongst the most widely used firearms with LEAs but we don''t very often hear of accidents that so and so fired the gun because there was no manual safety feature on it. So I think opinions will differ on this subject and to me, it''s really a matter of personal choice.\n\nPersonally speaking, I consider CZ999 a safe pistol to be carried. But this is my personal opinion which has got something to do with my carrying habits that I have developed over the years. I normally don''t carry a round in the chamber unless the danger is very imminent. I feel that in normal circumstances, there is always enough time to rack the slide and shoot (it takes slightly more than a second). But someone else may have a very different carrying habit and accordingly, a different requirement for safety in the handgun he is carrying. :)', 0, 1, '119.153.56.155', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3091, 118746),

I myself am engaged in Renewable Energy generation research since a couple of years. Our non profitable research plateform is named "Brains for Innovative Research Development & Strategic Studies". We developed a number of solutions and working on some innovations. I would like to share some innovative things with PGians. There are several sources of renewable energy including wind, solar, thermal and geo etc. About 15 Million Mega Watts electricity can be produced in Pakistan from Solar Power per hour!!!! This is enough power for whole world needs. There is no lack of sources but only ignorance, corruption and personal agenda seeking minority that is our biggest drawback. I will be very happy to provide information, technological help and guidance in this field if any of PGian friend asks. Please see following.\n\n\n\n\n[quote]Stirling Engine Solar System can help meet energy crisis \n\n\nBy Manzoor Qadir \nLAHORE: The Renewable Energy Research Division of BIRDS (Brains for Innovative Research Development and Strategic studies - a Pakistan based think tank) is developing a technology using modified Stirling engine and sun tracking solar reflectors to produce electricity at no re-occurring cost. \n\nOnce, developed this technology will be available for mass production of in-house power generation units with zero carbon emission from 5 to 25 kw/h capacity at very low manufacturing cost. A proposal is submitted to the Chief Minister Punjab for the promotion and capacity building of research & development of project and to safe guard the intellectual property rights of the idea, Noman Shah, Chief Coordinator BIRDS, and former Project Director Electronic Government Directorate, Ministry of Information and Technology, Pakistan told The Post \n\nHe said the solar stirling dish engine technology had been developed over nearly three decades by some of the world''s top engineers and scientists in ford advanced development operations, Mcdonnell-Douglas Aerospace & Defense And Boeing Aerospace & Defense and further other advanced countries became involved relevant research and development and currently many companies including Sun Solar, Sandia Laboratories, Stirling Engine Systems, Tessera Solar are producing such dish solar power systems. He said once developed this technology will make load shedding and energy crises a forgotten dream. Pakistani engineers and scientists has enormous capability and ability to accept any challenge and if they can develop indigenous nuclear technology why they can not make the country self sufficient through unleashing the tremendous powers of solar energy and develop solar reflector based stirling power generation systems. BIRDS chief informed that they are also working on several innovative ideas like parabolic trough solar thermal power generation and energy storage methods as well. The world largest and first commercial parabolic trough 50 mw solar power plant is constructed near Guadix In Andalusia, Granada Province (Spain), one of the sunniest regions in Spain costing 300 million euros. The solar energy in the deserts of Thal is sufficient to produce enough electricity to fulfill all the current and future requirements of the country and can be constructed at economical cost compared to the international examples. \n\nShah further said BIRDS is also working to bring foreign investors from all around the world to Punjab and one of the delegate in this regard from Spain is currently on visit to Lahore is looking for investment opportunities in renewable energy and low cost housing sectors.\n[/quote]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq997IJ][img]http://s3.postimage.org/997IJ.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '119.153.33.20', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4520, 118815),

According to him, dreams are wishes unfulfilled, desires to control self (Ego) repeating of past day joy and fears. Essentially, dreams are part of early stage of sleep (half sleep and half awake). Four stages of sleep, in 8 hours repeat automatically. Dreams are self defense mechanism and suppressed emotions of child hood. Dreams analysis was done first by Freud in 1900. He divided the dreams in four categories: 1) Anxiety ,2) Punitive, 3) fear, 4) Suppress sexual dreams.\n	 All mammals, cats and dogs dreams. Person dreams in the first stage of sleep (REM) but as gradually a person goes into deep sleep, the dreams stops and person almost anesthetized. But about 90 minutes later the brain clock feed backs to in reverse order from 4th stage to first, person dreams again then the cycle is repeated. A person dreams 12-20 dreams during sleep. Most of the dreams are forgotten by morning and fragmented dreams are remembered, Why? I do n’t know.\n	From the dawn of history, dreams are associated with myths, and  mysticism. Who knows, that interpretation is true or false or Devine intervention. Mystic believes in them and science is puzzled just can not answer. I have my sister and very mystic whose dreams sometimes hit on the head of  the nail. For me, they are just dreams. Try thinking something pleasant before you go to sleep, you will be surprised that it is repeated in your dreams……………but not always. \n	Most of the dreams occurs early in sleep cycle and just before dawn, when person is refreshed and reenergized in the morning. Human are night sleepers by nature. The cats, lions, and snakes are day sleepers. While we human work during the day, cats take naps all day and awake most of the night. If you have dog, observe him when he is dreaming. Twitching, and screaming is most often observed in dogs when dreaming (fear, anxiety or punishment dream).

I wanted to have input from someone who has fired extensively with a Makarov over the years :)\n\nAK47 Sir, now, I am quite interested in Makarov too. So its now between PT145 and Baikal MP442 :). Both seem to have their own peculiar advantages. Makarov has steel frame which has always been my preference. Its mechanism is very simple and time tested for its reliability, however, difficult availability and potency of ammo is the downside. PT145 has the advantage of a potent caliber but somehow, I dont feel very comfortable with a polymer frame, that too with a .45 ACP round. Something like Kahr K9 or MK9 or T9 would be very interesting. The search and research goes on........... :)\n\nAs for ballistics, for FMJ cartridge, it goes like.................... (data taken from internet)\n\n[b]9x17 Short / .380 ACP / 9mm Browning Short / 9mm Kurz / 9mm Corto[/b]\nBullet weight.......... 6.16 grams (95 grains) \nMuzzle velocity.......290 meter / sec (951 ft/sec) \nMuzzle energy........260 Joules\n  \n[b]9x18 Makarov[/b]\nBullet weight.......... 6.1 grams (95 grains)\nMuzzle velocity.......310 meter / sec (1017 ft/sec) \nMuzzle energy........302 Joules\nNote; 9x18 Makarov is a different cartridge from 9x18 Ultra / 9x18 Police. Both are not interchangeable. \n\n[b]9x19 Luger / Parabellum [/b]\nBullet weight.......... 7.45 grams (115 grains)\nMuzzle velocity.......352 meter / sec (1155 ft/sec) \nMuzzle energy........461 Joules\nNote: These are specs for normal commercial FMJ round. There is a huge variety of ammo available in 9x19 with much higher muzzle velocities and muzzle energies in a variety of bullet types. \n\n[b].45 ACP / 11.43x25 mm[/b]\nBullet weight.......... 14.9 grams (230 grains) \nMuzzle velocity.......255 meter / sec (837 ft/sec) \nMuzzle energy........484 Joules\nNote; Above specs are for commercial FMJ loads. Like 9x19, many hotter loads are also available in .45 ACP which have higher muzzle velocities and muzzle energies. \n\nI wanted to get chamber pressure data also for the above cartridges but could not. \n\nFrom above specs, one may conclude that 9x17 or .380 ACP does not seem to have enough stopping power that one would need for SD. 9x18 Makarov is just ok. 9x19 para and .45ACP, both are potent rounds with enough stopping power. Variety of hotter loads available in these cartridges makes them much more versatile and lethal.  However, this must be remembered that ammo is fired from a gun and if the gun is not reliable and accurate, ammo wont make much of difference anyway. :)', 0, 1, '203.99.183.197', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4494, 119071),

Always try to not get involved in such matters but if the condition is serious then first you had to call the police and informed them about the situation alongwith with your weapon information and after then if you had killed any BG inside your house it will be much easier for you to convince them.

All movement should help you survive if done correctly.  There is the sudden, fast, explosive movement to be done as you draw and force the attacker to deal with your movement from where he was attacking, then:\n\n- distance favors the trained shooter.  (this assumes you are better trained than the attacker)\n- rearward movement is smoother; the toe to heel roll produces much less movement in the gun than the forward or side step.\n- it shows retreat, "even though I was retreating, he kept attacking, that is why I shot."\n\nAlso submitted for your consideration:\n\nThe failure to stop drill (2 shots to center mass, an evaluation, and then a shot to the head, was submitted as a solution to one of a few problems, these being:\n\n- a criminal attacker high on drugs (crack, cocaine, meth) who may not immediate cease an attack simply because he was shot.\n- a criminal attacker wearing body-armor/ballistic vests so that the shots to the chest did not stop the attack\n\nLately the failure to stop drill has fallen a bit out of favor in the US law enforcement circles.  When officer''s shot twice (and maybe missed twice) then paused the attackers were still attacking and some were hurt or killed.  \n\nSome LEOs are training to continue the rapid shots to the center mass.

He became fed up with being ambushed crossign rice fields and expending entire basic loads and not having a body to show for all that shooting.\n\nSo, during training one day he took a squad to the edge of a rice field and said, "Imagine you are Charlie, and you are ambushing a group of American''s on that rice patty, set up to ambush them."  The soldiers did what soldiers do- they went prone, usually next to a large tree for protection.  My father-in-law placed C-ration cans in front of their heads and had them move away.  \n\nHe then brought another squad into the same rice field and said, "You are crossing this rice field when Charlie begins shooting at you from that tree line." (where the C-ration cans were). "Shoot back."  They did what soldiers with the new M-16 did- switched them to full-auto and sprayed out all of their ammo on the tree line.  \n\nHe took the second squad to where the first squad had been and told them what the C-ration cans meant and showed them that NONE of the C-ration cans had a hole in them.  None of their attackers had been killed.\n\nBack out to the field he took them.  "Now, keep the rifle on semi-auto, fire two or three AIMED shots to the left of the tree where they meet the ground and then two the right of the tree just in case he is a lefty or he moved at the first shot to the left."\n\nThey did so, and back to tree line they went.

It''s a decent looking pistol although as soon as you hold it you notice that it weighs quite a bit more than other pistols at around 1000 grams compared to the Glock 17''s 625g and the Canik''s 850g. The Barrel length is around 5.1 inches compared to the Glock 17''s 4.5 inches and the Canik''s 4.7 inches. The trigger pull is nice weighing in around 4.5 lb''s. In comparison the Canik also has the SA pull at 4.5 and the Glock at 5 lb''s. The slide / frame is ported to reduce recoil and make for a more accurate subsequent shot. Here is some eye candy.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/zig2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zig1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\nSo since it looks the part and acts the part, is the Zigana really a competition gun ? Well yes and no, it certainly has all the things required from a range gun but here''s something which I often say, no matter how good you are, human error will ensure that there will be the occasional bad shot and to counter this your gun has to be ''forgiving''. By that I mean if you mess up, your shot should still land in black (7) somewhere not go directly to 2 or 3. The Zigana''s trigger is very rigid and ''different''. You mean to squeeze it but it ends up getting jerked. In theory it should work better than the Glock and the Canik but it doesn''t.\n\nThe sights are Novak like and easy to acquire but the shot does not always land up where you expect, infact quite beyond your expectations. In my case I was aiming at dead center and hitting 4''s and 5''s. For myself and the owner, we had to compensate and aim at 12 o clock 7 to hit close to center.  Weird. Below are the two targets I shot with it at 15M. \n\nThe Zigana is a good pistol and is capable of really good groups but if I had an option of choosing between it and the Canik Piranha I would pick the Canik without thinking. It is also important to mention that the sport is just a range gun, it''s too big and weighty to carry around for self defense, while the Canik also doubles as a very good combat gun. \n\nThanks to the Owner Mr. Omer Butt for lending me his pistol. Wish you great shooting with it.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigt1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigt2_resize.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '119.154.42.100', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2324, 119429),

Very bright and sunny day it was and hot too. \n\nI had adjusted the sights after my first range test but found out on this range test that I had some how over adjusted. Average POI which was left of the bull had now completely moved to right of the bull. :) My mistake anyway and I have planned to take the key which works the adjustment screw along with me to get live feedback. \n\nPistol still shot on the average about 2" higher than POA even that I used 6 O'' clock hold, as decided after what had resulted in the first range test. For the next test I will modify my grip backstraps because I have a feeling that when ''Tightly'' gripped, the more protruding back strap buldge of the Largest one that I have installed, kind of over lightens the muzzle and I felt it quite jumpy and free floating. More practice will also resolve this issue as it will eventually change my former gripping habbit in the persuit of results.\n\nI choose 15/18/20M distances from the target this time with 10 and 7M for rapid shoot. POF 2Z ammo was the worst in performance from this pistol in this range experience. Chinese was a lot better. UCW Russian was the best so far. But as always, more power to practice as it continues. I have a feeling that POF FMJ vs. 809''s 4.2" barrel did not mate along well provided the gripping technique I am currently using. I have not disregarded POF ammo on this one experience rather I am 99% sure of shooter''s errors on a different ammo which may not be the top accurate load for this pistol. But I do expect it to shoot in a bit modest manner next time than what it did perform on this range test.\n\nFired total of 115 rounds out of which 25 were Chinese, 50 POFs and 40 UCWs. 100% reliability in these 115 shots with no Feed/Extract/Eject or Fire failure. Gun has done with zero malfunctions so far with 165 rounds of its total life, let us see what more we can get in the reliability department.\n\nAs a side note I would like to share that I have been carying this piece off and on these days and it serves well for IWB conceal carry for me. \n\n[b]Target Pics:[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsKYu9r][img]http://s2.postimage.org/KYu9r.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 8 rounds of UCW ammo from 15M, target size 6" dia, group size under 4" between two farthest holes.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxPEHji][img]http://s1.postimage.org/PEHji.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 8 rounds of Chinese White Box from 15M, group size 5" between two farthest holes.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVaZqpi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/aZqpi.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 9 rounds of POF from 15M, there was no relevant group size with these.

Any law which carries heavy punishment for small offense.also called Athenian scribe laws.\n There was a king of Hungry, Croatia and Serbia named Vlad the III. His Grand Father “Tepes” created the order of the Knight called Dragoon, means Dragons. These were the Knights who battled against the Muslim in 15th century. Dragons did win some of the battles against Muslim Turks. But, eventually lost and Turks occupied the Eastern Europe for a century or two.\n	 Vlad III,  the grand child of Tepes, was very inhuman, and cruel. He made many laws which were almost impossible to follow. Many Eastern European people were converted to Islam by the Turks around 1431 and these are the Muslims of Croatia ,Hungry and Serbia. \n	Vlad made the laws that anyone who would convert or collaborate with Muslims will be impaled, his favorite method to kill people slowly. He also made several harsh laws concerning everyday crime. For example, a thieve  will be crucified up side down, common criminal were thrown to hungry wolves.  Any criticism of the king was forbidden, and their tongues would be pulled out from their throat. People were not allowed to marry without his personal approval and the punishment was to tie the man and women who did not have permission to be gutted out alive\n	Vlad  was so horrible that he made his sister who disagreed with Vlad, thrown from the palace which he built on the top of the mountain right on to the spears. His atrocities were uncountable, even the Muslim Caliph Omar the first was horrified when he saw the dead bodies decaying on the crosses and spears . The story has that Caliph could not sleep many nights after and returned to Turkey. Muslim called Vlad Draco from the word Dragon and then the famous name Dracula by the other Europeans His laws were called Draconian laws.\nFinally, Vlad III was defeated by the Muslims and killed. His palace on the mountain was made into historical site and now a tourist attraction . Dracula’s palace still exists in present day Romania.

Good and Accurate piece with some beauty. A very Rough and Tough piece though i had dropped it few times from my hands but no serious issue with that.\n\n2) .33 calibre Chinese pistol with black barrel full metal, distributor are WINAMAX. very powerfull thing but not very much accurate due to its high velocity calibre.\n\n3) Zigana Sports Black and Silver colour with exhaust barrell, Turkish made good accurate due to its long barell, .9mm Calibre but a bit heavy and big size to carry in a concealed manner.\n\n4) Zigana-F Semi Automatic Black Colour the most favourite of mine due to it fine finishing with quite a compact size along with some muscles to fire rapidly due to its built and technology which is similar to Zigana-F Automatic its other version. Turkish made and very accurate also. \n\n5) Stoeger, presently producing in Turkey on Berreta''s dye machinery with Full metal body and revolving barell which reduces the chance of jamming or ejecting a bullet from and inside the chamber. A very much Comapact piece and easy to carry in a conceal manner.\n\n6) American Mossberg Shotgun, Pump action Full metal body, black colour and Plastic body torch below its barell. 12 Guage a very much reliable piece. Less jurk as compare to the other pump action Shout guns. \n\nHope that will provide ease to your questions now. Will post the range reports of the above mentioned weapons inshallah! alongwith the others from my collection and will explain that why i love the ZIGANA-F among all of them with some proves.\n\nThanks again', 0, 1, '125.209.124.227', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4579, 120437),

In my view, this is the basic purpose of this site; we share our experiences of the available weapons thereby enhancing our knowledge and understanding. I personally appreciate the fact that brother TT33 has shared with us his firing experience of Taurus 909. This is his experience and certainly not a final verdict but its an important one and must be given due consideration because it is based on firing results. \n\nOn the theoretical side, IMHO, the difference between a good weapon manufacturer and a mediocre one is the consistency in producing quality weapons. Research tells us that even the best companies come out with occasional lemons and even a very mediocre company sometimes produces a weapon which becomes a bestseller. The reputation of Colt or Sig or H&K or Glock or Beretta or Steyer or Kimber etc is good because they normally come out with good / innovative designs and than ensure quality control on consistent basis. In case of a mediocre weapon manufacturer, one model is very good, the other is just average, third one may be a failure and fourth may again be a good one. Within good / popular models, mediocre or average companies have occasional or in certain cases, frequent quality control issues.   \nJust my two cents on the subject..........    :)', 0, 1, '119.153.217.89', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3021, 120689),

Could you please define it in some tangible terms like the distance from which you fired and the group that you achieved (in inches). Was the group formed close to POA and if it was away from POA, how much? \n\nPlease don''t mind this barrage of questions. Actually i am quite inquisitive to know the details because it is the second report which describes ghost TR2 as a very accurate handgun. :)\n\nRegarding ammo, IMHO, if a handgun does not fire well with POF, Russian and Chinese ammo, which are the cheapest and most commonly available ammo in Pakistani markets, than this is a very serious limitation and must be kept in mind unless one has some arrangement for free supply of ammo from Federal, Armscor etc :)  \n\nThanks and regards', 0, 1, '119.153.136.117', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3987, 121049),

After the advertisement hunters can apply for the trophy permit. Sometimes permits are issues through draw and for some species on first come first server bases. \n\nThere are different species of big game in different provinces that are being offered for trophy hunting. Like Sindh ibex, Himalayan Ibex, Urial, Blue Sheep, Kashmir Markhor, Sulemiani Markhor, etc. But most of these species are only allowed to foreigners. Pakistanies can only hunt sindh ibex and might be urial through legal permits. Rest all black buck, hong deer, spoted deer, bule bull, barking deer, chinkara, etc. all are ban to hunt legally\n\nFor sind ibex the permits cost around Rs. 60,000/- to those hunter who are resident for Sind and for hunters of other provinces the same trophy cost around Rs. 100,000/- \n\nAfter getting a Trophy hunting permits the hunter will harvest his trophy in the presence of wildlife officials. The selection of animal i.e. trophy for hunting is being carried out in consultation with wildlife officials.\n\nThe trophy hunting is being carried out in wildlife game reserves and national parks. In Punjab there are there are types of wildlife game territories for all species. One is Sanctuaries, second is Game reserves and third is National parks. According to Punjab wildlife ordinance no human being is allowed to even visit a sanctuary because they are for game protection and conservation, even at a distance of 1 km from the border of sanctuary hunting is not allowed like Domeli is sanctuary for partridges. Game reserves are those areas where one needs special permits to hunt. Like Rasool is game reserve for waterfowl. National parks are those area where sometimes one can hunt but on special permits and usually national parks are used to see wild animals and sightseeing for common public like Tarkai is a national parts for Urial and some other species.\n\nFurther there is no thrill in trophy hunting for most of the hunter except bring an animal at home the thrill is only for those who claim their trophies in terms of horn lengths and have established trophy rooms in their houses and have lust to collect different species. As one fix time with wildlife official get on jeep reach the game reserve and there are abandon of animals in the game reserve you select one take on shot and bring the animal home. Except a few species but they are in northern area and their trophies are not allowed to Pakistanis and even not affordable.\n\nNow you can well image that how many hunters who show pictures of different trophies on internet hunt legally???????????? But don’t ask…………..!\n\nThe other way of trophy hunting is illegal for this either you need connections at high level or good relations with locals both work well…………..\n\nAnd one more this personal jungle or private land is nothing. if you have a land say measuring 100 acers are there are partridges on you land under law the land the your but partridges are not unless and until you have a declaration and approval of wildlife department to declare your land as a private game reserve. This involves hell of legalities and there are only a few legally approved private game reserves in Punjab. But after the government approval the owner of private game reserve have equal rights on his land.\n\nIf you need any further information feel free to [i][cell number deleted as per forum policy][/i] e-mail at [email]zarar@phsadc.org[/email]\n\nMy dear a common hunter with normal resources can only dream of trophy hunting', 0, 1, '115.186.13.244', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4389, 121191),

Coupled with good quality ammo (Serbian Prvi Partizan hollowpoints or Chinese ball); never experienced a single problem. Have shot 3 Taurus handguns, the PT57 (.32ACP), the PT609 and the PT917.\n\nIt would probably be incorrect to say that the Taurus is not very popular outside, specifically the US. Despite the fact that there is a smaller price difference between Taurus and the other "higher" brands, people still choose Taurus, as it often gives them more features for less, compared to the competition. The Taurus 24/7 has (in most magazine reviews I have come across) received quite favorable reviews, which leads me to believe that in Pakistan, the gun is more plagued by ammo quality troubles than any other.\n\nA simple comparison, both Taurus pistols, the PT111 and the PT145, 9x19mm and .45ACP respectively may bring to light some observations. The former (and its variants) have received flak, now and then, for ammo troubles, while the latter is deeply lauded for its performance (as seen from the recent rush to buy PT145s for CC). From my limited knowledge, the .45ACP rounds available here are mostly limited to the high quality, high priced kinds, while the 9x19mm has a host of options, including, but not limited to, Darra-made, POF and Chinese, ranging from premium ammo to substandard bullets. What I glean from this information is that the PT111 may be suffering from the fact that most of us (I believe) use either POF or Chinese for general use, in other words, cheap, affordable ammo.\n\nProfessional reviewers in gun magazines understand that a particular gun cannot equally perform equally with all sorts and brands of ammo, although there are some pistols which are notorious for gobbling up whatever is fed. Each review, usually, advises the potential user to test out his particular gun with a variety of ammo, and reach their own conclusions about the reliability of each brand.\n\nNo, Taurus does not pay me to defend them :D (though I wish they did!), but the fact that my only experience has been with Taurus pistols somewhat contributes to my bias towards Taurus.', 0, 1, '110.37.16.43', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4273, 121405),

You gun works perfect with both Brand A and B, but even if my gun does not perform reliably with Brand B, it doesn''t bother me because Brand A is the one which works for me, and Brand A is the one I carry.

No doubt the Glock is more ammo reliable that the Taurus''s polymer/striker-fired pistols. Sir, you are absolutely right when you say that Glock made their pistols that way, which is why they became popular, and which is why they sold well. They were reliable. Absolutely.\n\nBack to why Taurus works. They give the features, particularly the safety lever (which I insist upon) at a [i]fraction[/i] of the price. Compared to the Glock which can fire [i]all[/i] that you can feed it, it will reliably cycle [i]most[/i]. However safe the Glock may be, the Taurus is safer.\n\nMaybe the Glock wins for you. Maybe the Taurus wins for me, simply because it gives me what I need, at a drastically lower price.\n\nThe question is not whether the Taurus is better or worse compared to other brands.

This will differ from person to person and accordingly, the importance of the same thing may not be same for two different persons. Also important are the habits and preferences that a shooter develops over the years. \n\nI can''t comment on other''s perspective and preferences but in my manner of thinking, I would never buy a gun that is ammo sensitive. And by ammo sensitive I mean sensitive to standard patent ammo which includes Norinco, POF and Russian ammos and not local made darra ammo. I fire a lot and just can not afford to have a handgun which is sensitive to Chinese or POF or Russian ammo. I have seen that these three ammos are not only the cheapest but at least two of them have always remained available, no matter what the circumstances. Therefore, how can I buy a gun which is sensitive to these ammos? (I am talking of my perspective). And during last 25 years, I have fired tens of thousands of rounds of these three ammos from dozens of handguns to know that there is nothing wrong with these ammos and if there is a problem, it is mostly with the gun and not with the ammo because the same ammo fires well with so many other guns. Also, in my personal manner of thinking, I would prefer to carry only that ammo in my handgun with which I practice in routine and about which I exactly know that how will it perform. I would seriously refrain from carrying such ammo in my handgun with which I have not extensively practiced, even if it happens to be the best available and most expensive ammo in the world. And I also know that I just can not afford to practice that much with Federal Premium JHPs as I can with say POF or Russian ammo. Hence my avoidance of ammo sensitive handguns :)    \n\nNow a few words about number of features that a particular handgun offers. My take on this is that lesser the features, more simple and reliable the handgun. So I would personally prefer a reliable, accurate and rugged gun with minimum of extra features and would try to avoid handguns which offer so many complicated features which do not contribute much towards enhancing the reliability, accuracy or ruggedness of that handgun. And if you see best handguns ever produced like Sig P226, Browning High Power, CZ75, Glock 17 & 19, Beretta 92fs, Makarov etc, they are all very simple handguns with only essential extra features. Armies and LEAs all over the world preferred them and still prefer them because they are all reliable, accurate and rugged. Will deliver when required with all types of ammos even during worst of circumstances. That what we need from a handgun, IMHO. \n\nThis is my personal perspective. I understand others may have a different perspective on the subject and may feel equally assured about the correctness of their perspective as I do about mine.

It''s purpose is to meet the weapon and ordnance requirements of Armed Forces of Pakistan which it is doing with fair degree of efficiency since the last six decades. It produces what Armed Forces want it to produce and not something which is selling well in the market. It has a long time affiliation with H&K only because a long time back, Army decided to adopt weapons manufactured by H&K. Should Army decide to change its weapons, POF will also accordingly develop the expertise to develop those weapons, regardless of their commercial value / status. \n\nAs for the low efficiency and foresight as an organisation,  this ill is peculiar to most state owned organizations; POF being no exception is certainly not the most efficient organization around.  Off course there are many areas where POF can and should improve, most important being modernising itself as per the requirements of time. However, with all said and done, it''s not that kind of a junk and crap organization as it has been portrayed to be, IMHO. [b]Similarly, an open internet forum may not be an appropriate forum to discuss inside working flaws of POF, which some of the members seem to know, perhaps in their official capacities.

Sigma pistols bear so much similirality to Glocks, that the lawsuit was rised against the S&W, so Smith & Wesson finally paid undisclosed sum (some millions of $$$) to Glock for violation of their patents, and then S&W received the rights to continue the production of Sigma line. \n\ntechnically, Sigma pistols are recoil operated, locked breech semi-auto pistols, built on modified Browning-style linkless locking principle. All Sigmas feature Glock-type single action-type trigger with automatical half-cock and manual striker cocking during trigger pull. Sigma pistols had no external (manual) safeties. Gun frame is made from polymer, the slide and the barrel can be manufactured from the stainless steel or from the carbon steel (in so called "Value" models). \n\nIn 1999 S&W improved the Sigma series. Main change was shortening the barrel and the slide by .5 inch (12.7 mm). Other improvements included more comfortable grip checkering, slightly enlarged ejection port and addition of the acessory rail at the front of the frame (under the barrel). \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsfwPMr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/fwPMr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsfwZL0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/fwZL0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsfx3Ki][img]http://s2.postimage.org/fx3Ki.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '119.154.45.239', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 340, 121624),

That is why we see that in the quest for more precision and consistency, top shooter finally end up reloading ammo as per their or their handgun''s liking and do not normally use market ammo. \n\n [b]However, the same philosophy can not be applied to the reliability of a handgun, IMHO.[/b] Say if a gun, if tested with 10 different types of ammos, fires well with 7 types but has stoppages with remaining three, we must first check if other reliable handguns also develop stoppages with these three ammos. If they do, the ammo is faulty. If they fire those three ammos well than there is no problem with the ammo. The problem lies with the gun. We just cant get away by saying that ok, don''t fire these three types of ammo and you own a very reliable handgun. I see it this way that there must have been some design or manufacturing flaw in this particular handgun which caused these stoppages . With the same ammo, the stoppages did not occur in the other guns. \n\nTalking of my personal experience, I have fired thousands of rounds of POF, Chinese and Russian ammos with Taurus PT99, CZ999, Baikal MP446, NP22, Beretta 92fs, Llama M82, Walther P38, HP77B, Glock 17 & 19 and many others handguns and never faced any problems, except may be one odd occasional stoppage out of 1000 or even more. Firing the same ammos with Taurus 24/7 pro, Akdal Ghost (both TR1 and TR2) and few local made clones, I encountered frequent stoppages, both failures to fire and failures to feed. With CF98 and Stoeger Cougar, I encountered very occasional stoppages (may be one out of 150 or 200 or even more). [b]So what should be my final conclusion; \n[/b]\n1.  I should stop using Chinese, POF or Russian ammo because it does not go well with few handguns. \n\n2.  I should stay away from these few handguns and keep using Chinese / POF / Russian ammo because it is cheap and I can practice more with cheap ammo. \n\n3.  Buy Federal or Armscor ammo for these few handgun and compromise on less practice due to the higher cost and fire Chinese / POF / Russian ammo with all other handguns because they have no problems with these ammos? \n\n [b]I leave it up to the readers to see where the life is easier and accordingly make their own decision[/b] :)', 0, 1, '119.153.140.40', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4273, 121876),

Propellant charge, used is of low quality and has higher concentration of errosive compounds that tend to foul the bore with excessive residue. Cleaning such barrels immediately with a proper procudure becomes mendatory or they form rust in no time.\n-Propellant charge is not carefully measured, peak pressure levels vary per shot and can be felt and heard in that way. Chances of failure to function slide properly (retarded slide) followed by stove pipes/failure to extract and eject. And chances for squibs(under powered round not able to exit rifling and stuck inside barrel) which could result in kabooms.\n-Bullets are not made from guilding metal in the core and proper copper alloy jacket. Differences in bullet seating depths per round and over all lengths. Differences in bullet weights. These bullet will not snuggly fit the bore diameter resulting in varied pressure peaks inside barrel which will result in un-timed cycling of slide or retarded slide cycling. This will result in inaccuracy, diminished range and stability of the bullet during flight. Also due to lack of proper copper alloy jacket which is made of other harder materials that is closer to scrap iron, these bullets tend to slip through the rifling lands without clinging onto them.

Other times it will be by someone who has been lead to believe that guns are bad and the people who carry them are, but they''re not really sure and are genuinely curious.\n\nThere are lots of reasons why someone would decide to carry a gun. For some, it is because of their job, like a police officer or bank guard. It could also be a person who regularly carries large sums of money for bank deposits. Those are obvious, of course, and not the ones that usually get questioned.\n\nSo why would an ordinary citizen want to carry a gun? The anti-gun crowd will tell you it is because of paranoia or that they want to feel big and powerful. I''ve never found either to be the case. For most, it is because they want to feel safe. But I''m not really talking about just the fact that a person who carries a gun thinks they can win any fight. Most of us know that criminals rarely strike with warning and the best you can hope for is a fighting chance. Though, that''s a fighting chance you don''t have if you''re not armed.\n\nThe feeling safe argument does come into play, though, and is particularly relevant to outdoorsmen. It can be very comforting while fishing in bear country to be carrying a firearm. Similarly, a woman riding the bus alone at night is going to feel much safer with a .38 in her purse than a rape whistle.\n\nMore than that, though, it is a feeling of safety that is born out of confidence. Think about it this way. If a person doesn''t know how to swim, they''re likely to be more afraid of being out on a boat than a person who knows that if the boat does sink, they have the skills to survive. It''s the same thing with a gun owner. They know that if something did happen, they have a tool and skill set available to them to up the odds for survival.\n\nFor others, it is a sense of responsibility. Here''s another example. Let''s say you''re having dinner in a restaurant and the person at the table next to you starts choking. A skill like the Heimlich maneuver would save that person''s life. Some folks feel they have a responsibility to their fellow man to learn lifesaving skills like that. For some gun owners, they do feel a responsibility to protect others, but for most it is more of a responsibility to protect themselves and their families. Taking accountable for your own safety and well being is something that used to be expected in this country. Now, it is more common for that obligation to be passed along to someone else, whether the police, the government, or a higher power. However, there are still plenty of people who still choose to be responsible for protecting themselves and their loved ones themselves.\n\nWe all know that, for most of us, the odds really are low that we''ll have some violent criminal try to break down the front door at two o''clock in the morning. But if it does happen, wouldn''t you feel safer if you had a tool and a skill that could stop the intruder from killing your, your spouse, or your children? I don''t think it is paranoia to want to be prepared just in case. After all, isn''t that what they teach Boy Scouts, to be prepared?\n\nGetting back to the misconception about gun owners being paranoid, I think it is actually more likely that a non-gun owner is going to be paranoid. A person who legally carries a gun has the confidence that he or she can handle themselves and doesn''t usually even think much about a criminal attack. They know that if it comes, they''ll be ready. However, a person who has had half of the "fight or flight" responses taken away is much more likely to be distrustful and afraid of people they meet on the streets or jump at every bump in the night.\n\nThose are just a couple of the reasons some people choose to carry a gun, but there are many more. I do know a few carry simply because they can. The Constitution says they have the right, Ohio law makes a concealed handgun license available, so they do it. There''s nothing wrong with that. Rights are like muscles, if they''re not regularly exercised they tend to atrophy.\n"', 0, 1, '119.154.22.209', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4651, 122488),

What good is a locked up gun when a prowler wakes you up in the middle of the night? What are you supposed to do? Say “Wait Mr. crook while I find my keys to unlock my gun cabinet to get my gun and load it.”\n\nOne time, many years ago, soon after I moved into my current home, I was awakened by the sound of a prowler on my porch. This prowler found himself eating dirt while a volley of AK-47 rounds tore up the trees just above his head. In the 18 years since that night I have not had one single prowler on my property while all my neighbors around me have been robbed numerous times. By the way I reported the incident to the local sheriff who came down and took a report and thanked me for the report and admired my AK-47, it was the only on in the area at the time. (It is a semi auto version and perfectly legal to own where I live.) What are people thinking when they own a gun for self-protection and then keep it locked up?\n\nMy guns stay loaded and ready at all times, by the bed, on top of a cabinet, under the sofa, beside the phone, on top of the computer, in my pocket, and other miscellaneous places around the house. And yes I have children in the house. I have raised many children, my own as well as others and they all know what a gun is and how it works and could, at anytime shoot any gun in the house of their choosing. The only requirement is that notify an adult before taking a gun outside to shoot, and it has always been a standing requirement in our house that we are available to supervise kids shooting at any time, anything else can wait.\n\nIt is the most awe inspiring thing in the world to watch a 10 year old rip off 30 rounds from an AK-47 that is almost as large is he is, or watch him load cock and shoot a pistol hitting a target dead-center without any help.\n\nThe common misconception is that a gun lying around a house will result in a kid dieing. This is not true! What results in a kid dieing is fear, mystery, curiosity, and ignorance in that order.\n\nLet me explain this way. For example let’s look at a scenario that has played out many times.\n\nKid finds his dad’s gun hidden in the closet and kills his best friend with it while playing “Cops and Robbers”.\n\nThe gun didn’t kill that kid; the four items below are what killed him.\n\n1 Fear; We are afraid our kid might turn out bad or get hurt so we must hide this gun in the closet.\n\n2 Mystery; why do mom and dad tell me to never get in their closet.\n\n3 Curiosity; Mom and dad are gone to the store, lets see what’s hidden in that closet.\n\n4 Ignorance; Wow a gun just like on TV let’s play with it.\n\nBANG dead kid!\n\nAs you notice the root cause is the fear of the parents,\n\nIn my house this could never happen, here’s why.\n\n1 Fear; we do not fear guns, they are nether evil, or good, they are tools, nothing more. Tools are not hidden in dark mysterious places!\n\n2 Mystery; since there is no hiding there is no mystery in our house, (well maybe a little but what’s hidden in the chest beside the bed won’t kill anyone:).\n\n3 Curiosity is seeking the unknown. Since guns in our house are out in the open and not a mystery there is no unknown and no reason to be curious abut them.\n\n4 Ignorance; This, is the GREATEST killer. EVERYONE in our house has seen what a gun can do and understand that a gun will BLOW you apart!\n\nOne of the first lessons I taught my kids when they were old enough to understand is the following; I set up a couple if melons in the yard and explain that the melon is just like a human head with brains in it, I then load a semiautomatic handgun with hollow point bullets in front of them and shoot on of the melons. Viewing the “brains” of that melon scattered on the ground, they very quickly grasp that you don’t want to be on the receiving end of a bullet. I then remove the clip and hand the clip to them so they can see that I took the bullets out of the gun. I then ask them if now that the gun I have is unloaded can it still kill you or is it safe? Invariably the answer was it is safe. I then, without another word turn and shoot a second melon with the “unloaded” gun, blowing it apart. The expression on their face shows me that they will never forget that even an “unloaded” gun can and will kill.\n\nThis system has worked for me for 24 years and I have no worries. So who is the Jerk, the person who by encouraging ignorance denies his child the ability to protect himself from the dangers in this world that he will sooner or later face, or the man who imparts to his children knowledge and understanding, and the power to protect himself, as well as the understanding that this world is a dangerous place? \n"', 0, 1, '119.154.22.209', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4651, 122490),

Aside of carrying weapons, lets get to one''s needs/places where one should consider himself safe, and I mean when one does NOT have known enemies. \n\nGenerally speaking, if I go to the busiest, largest market in Allama Iqbal town, lhr where noone but families and normal good folk are going about their business, unsuspecting of any outcome that would make it the last day of their lives, would you say thats a safe place? Recall Moon Market lhr. A restaurant where good folk just go to relax with friends and family. Safe? plz recall the Marriott and Luna Caprice. With the current situation of Pakistan, where I live, and hence take to be my framework of input for making my decisions, I can recount literally hundreds of incidents in all kinds of places where one might NOT consider carrying thinking they''re safe, but they''re not safe, are they? By the same token, even Law Enforcement personnel who carry weapons for a living aren''t safe. Recall countless attacks on police stations, military check posts, FIA offices and so forth, all over Pakistan. I feel i can say, anywhere from my own home to the Military General Headquarters isn''t a safe place in Pakistan, based on real incidents that took place. \n\nThis establishes two things: \n1- My need or threat assessment process concludes that I am safe absolutely nowhere. How can I then create a list of places where I shouldn''t carry? How can i create a list of places where I can or cannot go? Again, I have no known enemies and don''t think am a ''gainful'' target for kidnapping. btw, +1 bros Faisji sahab and KageFox sahab for explaining it far better than i ever can\n\n2- Bringing a concealed weapon into the equation. I agree that in some situations, a tool, such as a gun or knife may not save you, but in these situations, not having these tools also won''t. Additionally, by not carrying, any chance or advantage you might have had, you deliberately forgo! I won''t make that decision. So, in a fight for my life, (which is no remote possibility) having a weapon MAY save my life. Not having it will DEFINITELY not!  +2 Faisji and KageFox bros\n\nIn conclusion, when anyone from the head of state (jhanda chichi blast, pindi) to high ranking military and government officials (countless accounts) to a commoner such as me (Nov 28, 2009 house break in, theft) isn''t safe, I will consider always carrying concealed UNLESS the law of where i am expressly forbids me. Only there I will either surrender my sidearm or leave is secured in my car. And this pretty much is what the purpose of this topic has been :) I agree with you that pulling a gun on a street phone-jacker will in most circumstances be wrong, according to the LAW (not necessarily according to what I think). If i shoot such a person to kill, then as far as my understanding of our "uncomplicated" law, that would be murder because i didn''t satisfy the stated pre-conditions of the constitution where use of lethal force would be justified. But this is a question of sensibility, right? Not one of carrying or not. I hope I''ve been able to clarify my position. I''m sure i speak on behalf of many, if not all my country-folk.', 0, 1, '58.65.167.98', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4190, 122492),

I agree that during the incidents in Marriott etc, someone being armed (assuming Marriott even allows it, which i doubt) wouldn''t have made a difference, but would it have been a better choice to not be armed?

Nor have we observed any common "firing pin breakage" history anywhere.\n\n5) Different .45 ammo gives same imprint, thus it''s not even ammo related as such, yet a "character".\n\n[b]We agree with you however[/b], that there [b]IS[/b] an "undue" friction somewhere between the firing pin and the shell during ejection process, but this got to do something with the [b]FAST AND SHORT movement of the slide[/b] during which the firing pin obviously does not manage retracting to the canal fully, not due to any spring weakness.\n\n But then, bearing in mind, that the firing pin itself is perhaps the "hardest" of components within a handgun, this minor "timing issue" has not given any negative/detrimental issue anywhere with the PT 145 whatsoever, hence we are of the conclusion that it could rightly be called a "character". \n\nThanks anyhow, for bringing this notion to lights and the opportunity to invite a discussion on this "trait".

I''ll try to answer your queries to the best of my knowledge, but I''d like more knowledgable members of our forum to correct me without hesitation wherever I am wrong.\n\n[b]1) Regarding acquiring a license without having permanent address:[/b]\n\nYou do have a CNIC and on it you must be having a permanent address. So, apply through a dealer located in the area in which you permanent address is located as per your CNIC. Get an MOI license because these are all-Pakistan and you''re not confined to keep this weapon within any specific province.\n\nThe MOIs are currently closed, but the rumour is that they will reopen soon (within a month or so). For more information about how to get an MOI license, read our MOI thread in detail in our Club House section.\n\n[b]2) Security of your family members:[/b]\n\nWhile you wait for the MOIs to open and get a license, secure your rented home and make sure that security measures such as intercom at the front door (maybe one with a camera), good quality locks and bolts for the main doors, iron grills for windows, etc. are in place. Also consider installing an alarm / siren system at your home which can be activated on the push of a button. The blasting sound of the alarm / siren helps in alerting neighbours that there is robbery / dacoity in progress and enabling them to alert the police plus it also helps is disorienting the robbers / dacoits and forcing them to consider leaving the house immediately.\n\nIf you still can''t wait for the MOI licenses to open up, check whether it is possible to change the permanent address on your CNIC and then apply for a Provincial License, which are still open in Sindh and take about two weeks to one month to process ''normally''.\n\n\nIf you do not mind my asking, just for my information, which locality of Karachi have you shifted to ?  No need for full address, just the Area and Block (For eg., N.Nazimabad Block C or Gulshan Iqbal Block 9 or PECHS Block 2, etc) would be fine.

Now that''s the kind of fire where problems like locking blocks etc come up and one needs to replace certain parts. Not in Pakistan, I reckon.

This is one of the best .22 pistols out there and my personal favorite. It comes with a 6 7/8 inch bull barrel and weighs slightly more than 2.6 pounds. The balance is great, the rear sights are adjustable and it also comes with a loaded chamber indicator which is quite rare in a .22 pistol. This is the kind of pistol that you want to get if you''re into light competition shooting or using at the range. The Walther P22 series and Sig Mosquito are more of a conceal carry light backup pistols. \n\nThis pistol sells for around 125 - 130 K that is if you can find it which is next to impossible. I also have a houge grip for it. Perhaps will put a scope on it in the future.

Females are only legally shot where there is an over population issue and even then they are permitted to be shot either as baits or as part of management and not as trophies. \n\nThe main aim of trophy hunting program is conservation of the very specie that is being hunted and this is achieved by taking old males that have past their breeding prime as they would already have passed their genes and they don''t have much further to contribute.

Also, the funds that are generated by trophy hunting fees goes into the conservation efforts thus providing benefit to the wildlife.  \n\nHowever, there are rules for trophy hunting and they are notified to hunters when they obtain their hunting permit, these rules are there so that wildlife is not exploited and to insure that there is no negative impact of trophy hunting on the game population. Under the Trophy hunting notification a Trophy Urial is considered to be a male with 24 inches or above horns and trophy below 24” if shot has to be confiscated by the game department and penalty being imposed on hunter.

Since I do all my purchasing here in Lahore I also sometimes need to carry weapons for my security staff in other cities. Most people I meet are quite surprised to find that I am able to carry weapons so casually in this day and age with so many airport security checks. I''m surprised at the fact, how can you not ??  If your weapon is legal and you are the license holder it''s TOTALLY LEGAL to transport your weapon to other cities (provided you have a all Pakistan license).\n\nHere the procedure. When you enter the airport (not the drive in/parking, the main door)  before you put bag with the weapon in the scanning machine, tell the security person there that you are transporting your weapon is in that bag. He''ll ask you to show your license. Show your license and a copy of your ID card. You''ll have to show him your gun, he''ll compare the gun number with the license, enter it in a register, enter your ID card info along with your flight information and ask you for your signature. Once that''s done lock the bag and he''ll come with you to plastic wrap machine, get your bag sealed (free of cost) and then accompany you and the bag to the flight check in desk and oversee you check in the locked bag with the gun. That''s it, just pick up your bag normally from the baggage line when you reach and you''re done!\n\nI''ve even gone so far as to transport gun boxes without bags and pick them up from the baggage lines although it''s fun to see people''s expressions at the baggage line seeing guns next to their bags lol\n\nPart 2:\nI would like to update that I carry routinely from all major airports of Lahore, Karachi, Isb. Just remember not to carry more bullets/cartridges then the allowed limited on your license, that can cause some issues.\n\nUn Quote\n\n[b]Another Valuable Procedure by Blood Bath:[/b]\n1. Go to ASF control room which is located at the departure of every airport ..do this to avoid confusion cause at times the alertness level is red-alert and you might end up in a mess..so got to the ASF contol room and tell the duty officer that you wanna carry your licensed weapon in "hold baggage".\n2. He will depute a person with you and if things are normal will tell you to go to the "Hold Baggage search counter" or the first search counter...remember you have to declare your weapon if you forget... the x-ray baggage screening machine will.. and the operator will ask you to show the license for the weapon.\n3.  They will take you to one side and will tell you to open the bag and show them the weapon,,they will telly the license with the small arm and will make the following entries in the "arms register"\n     a.     Caliber of the weapon\n     b.     Make and type\n     c.      License number\n     d.     Number of magazines and rounds.\n     e.     your all personal details\n     f .     flight details and all\nthen he will call a guy from "PIA Security" this guy is responsible for inspecting and verifying the weapon for safe custody he is also responsible for locking the bag in which the weapon is kept the bag must be locked and strapped and there should be no round in the magazines and also there should be no magazine in the gun. The PIA Security guy will then book the baggage on your ticket and will give you a baggage tag. One copy of the baggage tag will be pasted infront of the arms entry in the arms register by the ASF guy. now the PIA guy will personally escort you bag till the baggage make-up area and then to the aircraft and will personally out it in the top priority pellet in the plane.\nNow once the plane lands you have the weapon bag amongst the first few cause of the accorded priority. You give the PIA people your tag and off you go.\nPlease remember that do declare your weapons if your weapon is accidentally not detected by the big x-ray machine (hold baggage) and is subsequently detected at the hand baggage search counter you will be declared a high jacker and its damn serious,,,,\n\n[b]Valuable Input by Skeeter60[/b]\n\nTraveling by air with weapons.\n\nTake a paper and write down the following details;\nName,\nAddress, Mobile number\nLicence number. Date and Place of issue\nFlight Number\nWeapon number and make\nNumber of cartridges/bullets\nWhen you reach the scanner declare there are arms /ammo in your box. and hand over the paper to the ASF person on duty.\nIt will be a great convenience for him to have all information ready. Show him the Licence.\nAsk him to call the security person on duty, immediately.\nThis guy is usually roaming somewhere and takes time to show up.\nThe security person ( he is other than ASF ) will check the weapon and ask you a silly question that is this a bara bore when it may be a rifle ) he will then put a steel wire around the lock and the box containing your  weapon and ammo.\nYou proceed to the counter where the luggage and weapon containing box is deposited by the security person in your presence and the tag numbers  and your seat number are passed on to the ASF.\nMake sure you arrive at least 30 minutes earlier then the regular arrival time\nCarry the weapon and ammo in a hard box or leather/canvas case which is lockable and has a lock with keys ready in your pocket.', 0, 1, '59.103.210.244', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4669, 123020),

You are not going to get this over night.\n\nThe VHF radios, of 5W, hand held type, are also not allowed. All frequencies are allocated, and you cannot transmit. You can only receive, so scanners are allowed, and we have grown up having fun with them especially when mobile phones in Pakistan were AMPS. For VHF, one also has to go through FAB.\n\nAll comms frequencies in Pakistan belong to Ministry of Defence, who chair the FAB. Then specific frequencies are de-allocated from MoD and licensed to a specific user. There are strict punitive actions against people violating the airspace. Its monitored, and people are caught and their radios broken.\n\nI would suggest, if you want to have a personal communicator, go to Circuit City or Best Buy, and pick up these Moto Comms sets that work in civil open use FM band.

Hope it is clear now :)[/quote]\n\n\nActually, Lionheart is quite right. There are/were 3 models of the Gamo commonly seen in the market. In increasing order of power: The Delta, the Shadow 640, and the Shadow 1000. The Delta is the compact one, with a polymer outer on the barrel, the Shadow 640 has a sort of a gray-colored polymer body with black inserts at the forearm and the Shadow 1000 is the full-size, black-polymer bodied one, which incidentally, many members of this forum, including yours truly, own.\n\nA fourth Gamo, the Hunter 440 was available a couple of years ago, which was essentially, a Shadow 1000 with better micrometric sights, a wooden stock and a better aluminum dovetail/rail.\n\nMr JuGno, you would best be served by a Delta or a Shadow 640, as brother Lionheart wrote above. I myself have little experience with Chinese B2/B3, but apparently, it is held in high regard by the esteemed members of this forum.\n\nAs for a scope, well my suggestion, if you are a first time air gun shooter, is to get acquainted with the iron sights, and then move on to a scope.\n\nI believe these links will help somewhat:\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1968[/url] \n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3608[/url]\n\n[i]Note: Apparently, other members replied while I was typing my post, so I deeply apologize for repetition of information[/i]', 0, 1, '110.37.27.146', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4674, 123219),

My reasons are as following. \n\nAccuracy, as a factor, is quite tangible and can be measured with fair degree of correctness if the parameters are kept standard. eg, This test should be able to show that Handgun A is capable of making a 2 inch group at 10 M, Handgun B is capable of making a 3 inch group at 20 M and Handgun C is making a miserable 5 inch group from 10 M. So this factor is tangible and can be measured. After the test we have the data, worked out on standard parameters. Now this data can be used by the user in the manner that fulfills his requirement.\n\nNow comes the question that a subcompact gun will generally not be as accurate as a long barrel full size gun hence it is not fair to conduct same test for both. My take on this is that the accuracy test should remain standard for both. Now it is up to the user to decided that what is his requirement. \n\nIf he is looking for a CC handgun than he should be more interested in 10 M test and maximum 20 M test. The gun should be making 2-3 inch group from 10 M and may be 5-7 inches from 20 M. \n\nIf one is looking for a full size pistol than it should be accurate at 20 and 30 M. And if he is looking for a match or competition pistol than it should be dead accurate even at 30 M. \n\nWhat we should not do is that lower down accuracy standard for a CC gun. Means we should not accept a 6-8 inches group from 10 M in any case on the pretext that I am going to shoot this handgun at a very short distance so I don''t really need an accurate gun. \n\nNow as we have seen in the previous tests, certain sub compact handguns like Makarov and compact handgun like Glock 19 and CZ75 have performed far better than much larger handguns like Beretta clones, Akdal Ghost, CF98, NP22, Kanuni S, Chinese TT, Taurus PT809 E etc. [b]So size of the barrel has not really made much of difference.[/b] [b]The overall quality of construction, which included so many aspects like slide to frame fitting, quality of the barrel, quality of the trigger, quality of sights etc etc contribute more to the accuracy of handgun than merely its overall size.[/b] Therefore, a well manufacture 3.5 inch barrel handgun may perform far better than a 5 inch barrel pistol with mediocre construction.  \n\nI hope I have been able to convey my point :)', 0, 1, '119.153.142.191', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 123618),

(109941, 3140, 96877, 'MIdreesTaj', 867, '', 1273932489, 'Zeroing a handgun is matching the Point of Impact with Point of Aim.\nOR\nTechnically, zeroing is your line of sight should intersect your bullet''s trajectory well at the point of Aim\n\nThere are two factors which are not constant throughout the process (keeping in mind that same firearm is used), one is Distance and the other is Bullet (you might be shooting at varied distances also you might be using different bullets)\n\nDistance for an instance, lets say affects the whole matter. Your bullet while on its flight has different positions on its way with respect to its flight path as the distance increases. The greater the distance, lower the bullet will fall. Bullet fired straight in line towards a target will never hit the point of Aim rather it will hit lower due to pull of gravity. The barrel has to be risen from the straight line of aim a little bit to land your bullet on desired point which is your Aim.\n\nBullet is the other major factor, which can have different characteristics depending upon its ballistics/terminal performance. In simple words, the bullet weight, bullet shape and ballistics of the specific rounds being fired translates into bullets having different flight paths yet fired from same firearm.\n\nPlease Note: In a typical combat handgun which most of us are likely to use, distance might not matter that much as typical range of engaging a threat might not exceed 20-25 meters and will mostly stay inside 15 meters. A 9mm bullet has enough of a flat shooting character with in these ranges. \n\nOn ther other hand, bullets having different (weights/shapes/material) matter more than distance (SD scenario) as these will drastically change your point of impact. Same is in the case of rounds of same caliber having different internal ballistics e.g moderate/hot/hotter loads. Also heavier bullet spend more time inside barrel having lower velocity than lighter bullets if the round''s internal ballistics are kept constant. They resultingly impact higher than point of aim due to muzzle flip at the time of recoil upon firing. Lighter bullet will shoot to the point of aim or will shoot lower if the sights are zeroed for heavier loads.\n\nNow the complete zeroing consists of lateral and vertical adjustment of sights to confirm Point of Impact with Point of Aim. In fully adjustable sights both kind of movements are possible hence zeroing can be done real time with some perfection. However on most service/combat type handguns sights are fixed type, i.e not fully adjustable. They are partially adjustable. That is, the sight can be adjusted only with lateral movements. Some sights have screws on them which let them loose in the dovetail (the channel in the slide where the sight is plunged in) and they can then be adjusted. However most sights dont have screws rather they are only plunged in the dovetail. These sights require manual work for adjustment. Slide is fixed in a catch and the sight is punched using a sight pusher.\n\nLater method is how a CF98 can be zeroed as it is a fixed sight pistol and only allows for lateral sight movement using a sight pusher. Note that, this will allow you to adjust your point of Impact horizontally only.

The purpose was to discuss with him the approach and possibilities for establishing the club. Since, one of my probable sources has been unsuccessful, I intend to contact him through other sources now. Will start working on this from Monday inshaAllah. If anyone here can get a meeting arranged with Dr. Inam, that would be great.\n\nWith regard to the thought process, I have been thinking about the following:\n\n1. Start off with a virtual club. The purpose of this club would be to mobilize some basic funds (with a nominal donation per member, say 1,000/- or so) to arrange a couple of workshops on the subject and collect some basic information on enthusiasts from Peshawar. If we want to move ahead on this subject we will need a good number of people that are willing to pitch-in in terms of their efforts, finances, contacts, sources etc. A meeting of some reliable enthusiasts from Peshawar or surrounding areas is a must.\n\n2. Talk to the concerned government authorities (including FC, DCO office - Arms Section etc.) in Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa (KPK) about the necessary procedure required and the possibilities that can be explored (including providing some facilities for private citizens at the FC club).\n\n3. Meet with senior representatives of the National Rifle Association (such as Dr. Inamullah) for getting thier guidance and views about how to proceed.\n\n4. Identify a suitable place for the club. Any space in the vacinity of Peshawar that can provide a rifle range and space for skeet/trap shooting would be appropriate. The handgun and air gun ranges can be accomodated within the same space.\n\n5. Once the procedure and plans are more clear, we can start contacting bigger corporate sponsors to help us gain leverage in the government and of course provide the basic start up funds.\n\nPlease share your views on the above... and any other ideas that you might have...', 0, 1, '221.132.117.17', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4480, 123809),

Frankly, I was expecting a harder recoil from such a small frame gun firing .45 ACP. But the recoil was very manageable and one hardly feels that he is firing a .45. Sights are good and allow quick aiming. There were no stoppages whatsoever and at the end of the day, I inspected the strikes on all the primers. It was a solid strike every time. The trigger of PT145, however, is not really very smooth and there is room for improvement. As for the ergonomics, like most Taurus guns, they are top class indeed. \n  \nOn Denovo sahib''s special request for a sub-compact handgun, PT145Pro was tested from 7M as well but the results have not been included in the final aggregate because I want to keep the testing method uniform. \n \nNow apparently, this final result is not mathematically very impressive. But since I am using a standard procedure for all tests, hence I wont change the procedure.

The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence.

The misplaced 30 M shots in the second target, however, are clearly my fault but the light was not good and I was tired too. The gun has a very nice trigger and one is always achieving a surprise break. Wonderful balance, it has the feel of an old classic gun with which old fashioned gun enthusiast like me are quite familiar. The racking sound of steel slide and frame are real nice. [b]In the end, it does what a top handgun must always and everytime do; it fires very very accurate...............

I have therefore summarized the performance of all handguns tested so far in this post. I have also categorized them as per their size / use. The purpose of doing this is that though all handguns are being tested using the same procedure, their accuracy results do not carry equal values in my view. For example, a score of 65% by a sub-compact gun may be far better than a score of 70% by a large frame gun. Mathematical values are good as they describe the results in tangible form but in the end, members should carry out their own analysis keeping in mind their own peculiar requirements for a handgun.

However, seeing its final form now, I realise that it has somewhat become a result card kind of thing which speaks good of certain handgun guns and also bad of certain handguns. Please keep in mind following aspects while going through this summary...................\n\n1.  This by no means is a final result of some kind of ACCURACY COMPETITION held between these guns. [b]Neither these tests are the perfect / most scientific tests for judging the accuracy nor this should be taken as the final performance of a particular brand of handgun.[/b] \n\n2.  I realise that the results of those handguns which I have been firing more over the years or I own are better than few other guns. This is natural. So please don''t get carried away too much with the mathematics. If Handgun A is scoring 77.11 and handgun B is scoring 74.34 than it does not necessarily mean that handgun A is better. Perhaps both are of same category . If PT99 and CZ999 are on top of the list than it does not mean that these are two most accurate pistols around and are better than say Glock 17 or few other because these have scored better percentage.  However, it does mean that both of them are accurate handguns and can be trusted for accuracy :) \n\n3.  Few handguns have performed really bad. This again does not mean that all specimens of this brand would perform the same way. May be the one I tested was a lemon or its sights were way out. [b]But one thing is for sure; there is some serious problem somewhere.[/b] So please keep that handgun on your watch list and check it thoroughly before making a decision to buy it. \n\n4.  [b]Please do understand my limitations as a human being as well.[/b] I will never be able to give a standard performance everytime because it is humanly not possible, only machines can do it. Accordingly, the results may slightly vary for different handguns but not too much. \n\n5.  [b]This, by no means is a marketing campaign for a few handguns and a dumping campaign for the others.[/b] You may consult this as a reference but finally make your own decision while you are buying a handgun, keeping in mind your requirements and pocket. \n\n6.  Therefore, [b]these tests are not a most scientifically conducted final verdict on a particular handgun, however, they do provide a tangible basis for judging one of the most important characteristic of any handgun; its accuracy.[/b]  \n\n\n\nThanks and regards :)', 0, 1, '119.153.134.37', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 123992),

The DAO only model''s trigger pull is measured at 6lbs 15ounces but smoothens up to 5.5lbs after a few hundred rounds.\n\n[/quote]\nSA sahib, thanks for your comments. \nTechnically speaking, DA or SA trigger does not effect the accuracy of a gun. However, practically speaking it does, for those who are not very well used to it. Longer trigger pull cause shaking / flinching etc which finally results in a misplaced shot. IMHO, those of us which are more familiar to a DA/SA trigger (which most of us are), will find it quite difficult to fire accurately with DA trigger unless they practice a lot with it. \n\nMoreover, if you notice, most competition or match pistols have SA triggers, generally ranging from 2-3 lbs, depending on the liking of the shooter. It ensures better trigger control and allows the firer to completely focus on the front site, which is so very important for accurate shooting. Conversely, many people prefer DA only triggers for SD. That perhaps is the reasons that Kahr (which specialises in manufacturing high quality CC handguns), has DA only trigger on all its handguns but that is a smooth and high quality trigger. \n\nYou will have to practice more to get fully accustomed to a DA only trigger :)', 0, 1, '119.153.133.24', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 124111),

Ruger underperformed because the sights were not zeroed as per my liking (zeroing differs from person to person). On the other hand PT99 sights were zeroed to my requirements hence it performed well. But I am convinced about one thing; while Ruger can score better if I carry out another test after properly zeroing it, PT99 is no ordinary handgun.

Price-wise also reasonable at 50-52K. :)\n\nAs for more detailed impression, you know, it''s hard to say anything about a gun that has not been fired by yourself, but from what appears on the surface, it''s a considerable item indeed, and as of maker history, you know Sarsilmaz is one established Turkish maker in the quality department.\n\nThe gun is widely in use by Turkish LEA''s, has an ALL STEEL/ALU frame and slide, a reasonably tight slide/frame connection, very unique finishing. Label it with any European/U.S name, you cannot tell it''s a Turk!\n\nLength is [b]210mm[/b], which should be slightly above 8 inches, barrel is [b]118mm[/b], which I believe is +4 inches, weight is [b]990[/b] Grms [b]WITHOUT[/b] mag! It''s a heavy item as such, basically due to the ALL STEEL composition, a Beretta 92 I believe is something like 940 grms. It''s a 15+1 Shots model.\n\n12 Gauge bro yesterday had reservations for it due to the weight, yet I tried a "hand feel" impression of both, the CZ 999 in one hand, the Kilinc in the other, and I personally did not feel any SUBSTANTIAL difference, deeming also the bit of "extra" weight somehow "beneficial" in the recoil segment. He however was of the opinion that it would give "wrist pains" on excessive use, I cannot say anything here. :) \n\nPersonally I''m of the opinion, it''s a nice solid item, a substitute for the PT 99/92fs, if one should want something out of the "tradition", yet i must say, it looks better than the PT 99.\n\nMay I add, it''s a CZ-75 off-spring, perhaps with a similar " natural point-ability" construction, and once again, what even 12 Gauge bro couldn''t dispute on, it''s wonderful "feel" in the hands.\n\nSome weeks back, while talking to Chief over the phone, I felt somewhat a "discrete" approval by him for this model.\n\nP.S...........Having written all above, a bit of "thorn in the side", heck there''s no "decocker", but a manual safety. You''ve to lower the hammer manually, yet it''s SA/DA both. :)', 0, 1, '119.154.109.233', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1297, 124188),

If i were to guestimate, I would say, he gun weighed atleast 1.5 to 2KG. leaving the weight issue aside, the best thing about the gun was the trigger which made it qualify in flying colors as an absolute POS. :)\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.152.124', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1297, 124190),

May I add, Fakre-Alam indeed has ONE GREAT VARIETY of weapons, ask for anything, a box of that will quickly be tabled before you! I''ve posted some items from there in the "Window shopping" thread.\n\n Aquarius bro met us here, and I must say, he''s one nice, soft-spoken gentleman we really enjoyed lots with. He has an immense knowledge into weapons, and to "some" extent, I could feel yesterday a PT 145 "crave" in him, when he time over and again would take mine and place it in his "dubaa" beneath his shirt, to feel how really it does conceal well there! :lol:\n\nI believe we''ll soon have another PT-145 entrant soon, Aquarius Sir! ;)\n\nAnyhow, the trip continued towards Hayatabad, where Ilyas bro was waiting to join in, and we went quickly through the famous Sitara Market, where I did manage to find a few "stars", in the form of a unique "Grip" for my rifle and some "rail covers" I had been looking for since long.\n\nThe rifle "Grip",may need some "modification, but 12 Gauge bro has promised some "work-shop" help.\n \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVQY0fr][img]http://s4.postimage.org/QY0fr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe Rail Covers (for Picatinny rail fittings):\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVQY7JS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/QY7JS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nHunger was "striking", especially "mini AK" who just wanted a "dumbaa" served for him right away, dead/cooked/alive, so Ilyas and Aquarius bro quickly arranged for the lunch over the phone, which was ready when we reached the spot on the Ring Road, and on our way, course, managed to have 12 Gauge bro''s "Pulau" packed from Baba Wali to be consumed at the "Dumbaa" spot! \n\nBoth guys, 12 Gauge and my son, if we''d delayed their lunch for another say 15 min or so, would simply have shot us with the CZ  999, they even liked to move around for themselves on the streets of Jamrud, cursing the other 3 of us for "waste" of time with weapons and ammo, heck it was the "food" they both travelled 350 Kms for!: lol: \n\nAnyhow, Ilyas really knew a very good spot, I''d never before considered on my frequent Peshawar visits, and indeed it should be tried by any of you if you''re around in Peshawar, it''s unique  in taste, and from the outer "facade" of the spot, you wouldn''t guess what tasty delicacies they really do serve in there! :P\n\nSome pictures: \n\nMy son picturing 12 Gauge bro''s "impatience" for the "Pulau"!\nAquarius bro in the background, discussing with Ilyas bro and me.

I had to requal with my duty gun and shotgun for in-service so there I was all day long shooting in dim light, flashlight courses, duty qual and shotgun course when after long last, lots of waiting and enough shooting to turn me off to the sport for about a week when the range session was finally finished for "official department business" and I could play.\n\n\nNow I say all this to lay the ground work that I didn''t want to be at the range and I was just turned off to guns in general when I shot the AR-24 but when I did It was actually pleasurable. My shooting hand was sore, I didn''t have enough sleep the night before, I hadn''t eaten any breakfast or lunch and I needed to pee by the time I got my AR-24 out and still it was so much fun I just kept loading the magazine again and again. \n\nI shot about 80 rounds or so through it and there was no hick-up. \n\nThe gun has no recoil. That is to say shooting it is like knocking on a door. There''s just nothing unpleasant there in the grip at all. When you shoot it there is just so much slide mass that there is no muzzle flip to speak of and the 9mm is a pussy cat round in a gun this heavy.\n\nThe sights were lacking and will have to be replaced. There''s just nothing nice I can say about the sights, they don''t belong on a gun. I shot low at 7 yards by 2" but the groups were so tight that the target I had was almost useless. \n\nThe gun was so accurate that I had to shoot an index shot, and then just put my other bullets as close to that first hole as I could. Folks, this gun can make a ragged hole. Even at rapid fire, IDPA speed, I was still fitting all shots in a group the size of a girls fist at 7 yards and I''m not a competition shooter. I put the gun in the hands of a IDPA competitive shooter, Rick Simes, (semi pro competitive shooter and range hustler) He seemed to like it but the trigger out of the box we agreed could use a gunsmiths touch though for a new gun, the trigger was mighty fine. It was probably around 12 pounds double and about 6 pounds single with a noticeable hump as you stage the trigger. \n\nAdvance Plating and Weaponry will fix the sight issue by fitting a new set of sights to the gun. It is a manufacturers defect in my opinion but that''s why they make adjustable sights. \n\nRick encouraged me to sell it to him when the "new" wore off. I was quick to tell him this gun will be buried with me. He just blew me off saying it would be a safe queen.\n\n\nHe''s right. I''ll be buried with my GP100. GOD after all prefers revolvers. \n__________________\nMAXIMUM ANNIALATIONIFICATION \n\n2nd review\n\nArmaLite wanted to update the gun a little cosmetically and bring it back to the US market, so they worked with Sarsilmaz to develop the pistol you see here. The final product''s slide might be familiar to fans of the Sig P210. One feature lots of people loved was the fact it could be carried "cocked and locked" like the 1911 although I always wondered why someone would buy a double-action and then not take advantage of the system. One advantage it does have over the 1911 is with the hammer cocked and the safety engaged it is still possible to retract the slide and unload without disengaging the safety. When the hammer is down, engaging the safety effectively secures the action since it prevents the hammer from moving, thus locking the slide. There is also a passive firing pin safety, but it is missing the magazine disconnect or mechanical lock everyone seems to love to hate. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator.\n\nThe three main components of the AR-24, barrel, flame and slide, are all machined on modern CNC equipment from solid forgings rather than castings as were used on some clones. ArmaLite reports the raw forging for the flame weighs over 3 1/2 pounds before it is machined. The finished frame, complete with guts and grips, weighs only a tad over a pound. A generous beaver-tail spreads recoil nicely and both front and backstraps have 20 lpi checkering. Some variations will have serrations instead of checkering. Grips on this test gun are wood with cut checkering, but later versions will have plastic grips The grip has a pronounced-and very comfortable palm swell on both sides and they extend outside the frame a little, which provides a great place for your thumb.\n\nMechanically there does not seem to be any differences from other CZs and fieldstripping is exactly the same. It is worth mentioning because it is a bit different from more common designs. On the left side of both frame and slide are a pair of witness marks just forward of the hammer. To fieldstrip the unloaded pistol, all you have to do is draw the slide back about 1/4" to align the two witness marks and then push the slide stop pm out from the right. The recoil spring and guide are not a captive unit so a bit of care is needed when removing it.\n\nShooting the AR-24 was properly uneventful and it shot without protest a wide variety of 9mm ammo including some less than stellar handloads I found in the junk box. The CZ-75 has a great reputation for reliability and the AR-24 does nothing to sully that. At around 500 rounds through the test gun there have been no stoppages or malfunctions of any kind.\n\nIn fact. I shot the ArmaLite for fun over and above the obligatory function and accuracy test because of the combination of good sights and nice trigger. The test gun has adjustable sights with the typical three dot pattern. but fixed and tritium illuminated sights are also available. My custom is to weigh triggers when I first get a gun and the initial 5 1/2 pound reading for the single-action was about what you''d hope for in a service pistol, but it was quite smooth and was no detriment to accuracy. Neither the single-action nor double-action pull weight changed with use.\n\nAccuracy was impressive, too. In my experience, stock 9ram service pistols average 3" to 4" 25-yard groups, but as you can see from the table the worst single group was only 3.04" and the average considerably better. Most of us are going to plink with guns like this, too, and good accuracy never hurts.\n\ni hope u find these reviews useful .', 0, 1, '137.101.194.36', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1297, 124331),

The weight and solidity is extremely satisfying. This has a smoothly engaging liner lock. The lock on the Benchmade is the proprietary frame lock of benchmade which they call a mono-lock.\n\nOf course, I being a thorough self respecting geek, took apart both knives. Cleaned and lubed the mechs and now they deploy like the breeze. The Boker is now my everyday carry tool\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/20-tacs.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/21-tacs.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/22-tacs.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/23-tacs.jpg[/img]\n\nThe blades on both are in excellent condition barring just a wee bit of chipping.

This is what has happened in our Thar desert, where 95% of Chinkara population is lost because of indiscreet shooting.\n\nHarvesting of an old male like the above has a good effect on the population as this allows younger and sexually stronger males to breed with females resulting in larger number of offsprings from a herd. However, if you kill a female then you have not only killed her but also effectively killed all the offsprings that she might have in her life time, which in a Chinkara and Urial’s case is one or two every year and also the offsprings of the offspring. \n\nAlso, if you start killing young and immature males before they have a chance to pass their genes then that gene pool is lost forever.\n\nWe as hunters have a responsibility that we make sure that the very animal that we love to hunt has a chance to survive. This will not only allow us but our future generations to continue hunt these magnificent trophies. \n \nFurther, a hunter with the help of a good binocular can judge an animal up to 400 yards to an accuracy that shouldn’t be off by a couple of inches that is not a problem. If an animal needs to be judged further then that, a spotting scope should be used. A good spotting scope will allow you to accurately judge an animal up to 1000 yards, no problem here. \n\nI hope that the next time our fellow Pak gunners go hunting, the success of their hunt should not depend on the killing of an animal, rather they should enjoy the experience and only shoot if they find a trophy even half as good as the above one.\n\nThis is just my two cent of advise.', 0, 1, '59.103.211.56', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4640, 124727),

I''ll elaborate on your point after a few updates as they are relevant to your question:\n\nUpdate: I had a meeting with one of the Managing Committee members of the Islamabad Gun Club today Lt. Col (Retd.) Raza (who has served as the President of the Army Rifle Association for over 20 years) with reference to our subject; he is also the administrator at the club. He was very happy to learn about our endeavour but was at the same time dissappointed in the role that the Peshawar shooters and enthusiasts were playing in the sport at the national level in terms of their participation. He shared some good points and made some calls here and there to facilitate me including an MNA and former activists in the shooting field Arbab Zahir, who confirmed that not much was going on in Khyper Pakhtoonkhwa (KPK) with regard to shooting. He shared that the government had alotted land through the Army for one shooting range (to be used for general public) in each of the four Provincial capitals, under the authority of the respective provincial rifle associations. As such, the Frontier Rifle Association was allotted a piece of land near the Peshawar airport runway (which we now generally know as the FC range). I shared with him that the general perception about this range in Peshawar is that it is not open to general public and private citizens, which he negated. He said that due to political differences, the club was not functioning as it was initially envisaged to service. And the FC has been given mainly an administrative role, which means that the range is not only meant for the FC! It is not closed to public. \n\nI also shared with him our plan to meet Dr. Inam, which he supported as he could not only play the role of a mentor, but also a facilitator in the capacity of the Frontier Rifle Association General Secretary. Lt. Col Raza further shared the following course of action:\n\n1. Supported the meeting with Dr. Inam;\n2. Meeting with the IG or DIG FC regarding the FC range services for private citizens;\n3. Meeting with the provincial minister for sports Mr. Aqil Shah\n\nTowards the end of the meeting we agreed that we should first determine the status of the FC range and its services. If for whatever reason (political or security etc.) this plan fails, then we will identify a private range. In a response to one of my questions he also shared that for the later option, we will need to have permission of the provincial home department. As you can see, Col Raza''s suggestions are inline with our thought process so I''m glad to know that we are on the right track.\n\n... Now coming back to your question Sonnenkind: Allow us to meet Dr. Inam and a high up in the FC first. If things don''t work, we shall arrange a meeting of enthusiasts in Peshawar to develop a work plan for establishing a private range. Thats when we will discuss initial donations, if at all required.\n\nIn the meantime, I request all members to bring onboard other enthusiasts and shooters to this forum so that they are also aware of the developments and can be informed for future events in time. In addition: Please provide the following information either on this forum (if comfortable) or email it to me privately on [email]mkkdurrani@gmail.com[/email]:\n\n1. Your full name and location (city or town would be enough)\n2. Occupation\n3. Email address\n4. Phone number (preferably a cell number that you mostly use)\n5. Interested to be trained/compete in which dicipline of shooting? Choose from [Air pistol / Air rifle / Rifle / Skeet / Trap / Double Trap/ Big Bore Handgun / Pistol]\n6.

Regarding my contribution, which is long over due, I got the time and opportunity yesterday to test the Baikal MP 446, however, unfortunately the Islamabad Gun Club range didn''t allow shooting a big bore handgun from 10 meters. So the tests couldn''t be conducted according to your procedure. Nevertheless, just for reference, I''ll post the pictures later today, alongwith some learning that I personally observed.\n\nFor now I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. Regarding the target, you''re measurements suggest that you''re using a standard NRA B-17 target (standard pistol precision/slow fire target for 25/50 m; with each ring being exactly 1 inch apart in radius)? If yes, then it also seems that you print your own targets and take only up to ring no. 5 and not all the way to ring no. 1? If not, then are you using the NRA B-37 target (standard pistol rapid fire target for 25 m), which has more distance between the rings and only goes up to ring no. 5.\n\n2. Your method also prescribes that the point of aim should always be the bull... Well, when I was testing the Baikal, aiming at the 6 o'' clock of the bull just didn''t work at all. I believe this is because the Baikal MP446 is a training and sporting model and therefore has a higher front sight. I was only able to hit the bull or near it when I was aiming at 12 o'' clock of ring no. 5 or 6 of the NRA B-17 target! I experimented this through a much more senior shooter, who came to the same conclusion...

In this phase pulling the trigger irrespective of the animal or bird in front is the most desired and enjoyable thing to do.\n\nThen comes the second phase wherein bags of nearby available species of games counts most. In this phase a hunter not only acquire required equipment but also learn different techniques like guns, calibers, cartridges, decoying, calling, blinds etc. just to harvest maximum bag. At the end of this phase a hunter is well aware of different game species, respective hunting spots and various hunting techniques and methodologies.\n\nThen start the third phase. Here a hunter change its hunting priorities like he /she become selective in game species like going for partridges shoot or going only in those areas where he might have more chances for grey partridge or black partridges or going for chukar or see-see………. Similarly in duck shoot more likes to shoot geese or ruddyshell duck or mallards depends upon a particular hunter’s choice. During this phase a hunter discover new hunting avenues and refine its hunting techniques and equipment according to desired game species at optimal perfection. Till the end of this phase a hunter has fulfilled its maximum desires of huge bags, has also harvested maximum of the available game species and have hunting opportunities at most desired destinations.\n\nDuring the second and third phase a hunter used all means and resources for hunting\n\nThen start the fourth phase where a hunter start talking about conservation, vanishing of game, hunting ethics, rules, regulation, etc. etc. here he / she become more selective and only hunt a few species. In this phase most of the hunters are found preaching Like “I only like to be in the field” I like the company of friends then pulling trigger” “I only shoot mallards” etc. etc. etc. and used to narrate stories of great hunting expeditions with some exaggeration. (Although story telling is a hunter’s particular hobby for life time)\n\nThen comes the fifth phase this phase starts when a hunter become physically week to go in the field. In this phase a hunter more like to talk about hunting than going out in the field\n\nCurrently with this global communication access through internet on different forums most of us are used to start talking about ethics and law in the second and third phase but ultimately practicing ethics starts in the fourth phase because unless and until a hunter has fulfilled its desires of having huge bags and harvesting verity of game species the curiosity usually not let a hunter to practice ethics (Exceptions are always there but don’t tell me that everyone here is an exception)\n\nAll members are requested to kindly correct if I am wrong otherwise tell us that in which phase you are ????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nHappy hunting to all', 0, 1, '119.153.13.73', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4736, 125059),

The triangles represent shots fired from an old Colt 1911 so that may be disregarded altogether. All shots were fired at 25 meters and the target used was a standard NRA B17 target. \n\nI won''t go into the scoring details as the method used had to be different. But I''ll share some things that I learnt through this test and will share other tests as soon as I can conduct these tests according to Gilani sb''s method at some private range:\n\n1. I realised that even if one does use a benchrest, it still won''t eliminate shooter''s error significantly because as mentioned in some posts above by other members, the grip, trigger squeeze etc. still play an important role; I thought so differently before. This is evident from the minor difference in my scores for benchrest as well as free hand. In fact, I''ve hit a few better shots without using the benchrest.\n\n2. This also means that the benchrest itself has to be prepared with great attention to minor details (as suggested by experts). Normally, one would have to prepare sand bags or other material suiting the shooters comfort. That is more custom work than I imagined.\n\n3. This further implies that either the tests should be conducted by an expert shooter who has immaculate hand control (which is a finding again opposing what I imagined earlier) or through some sort of a machine rest in which the handgun can be fixed.\n\nWith my findings above, I''m not sure how this whole testing business can be made more reliable except that the shooter should be an expert, which is the cheapest solution but in fact a difficult one as we''ll have to wait around for the experts to share their test results... But even in that case, there would be a considerable margin of error and the results might not be considered absolute. By saying this I''m implying that although these tests will definitely give valuable information about a handgun''s accuracy, I don''t think we should do injustice to the guns by ranking them strictly. Any handguns falling in the very accurate/extremely accurate categories should be given preferance. I''m sure the expert shooter will be able to perform well with these handguns...\n\nOpen for comments!\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqjU_b9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/jU_b9.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '116.71.216.29', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 125100),

Trigger is operated by a lever which gives a smooth and consistent pull regardless of how many times you fire it. They also have base pads which enables them to adjust lateral or vertical movement of your bore line just like you will do with pistol sights to move your POI. \nA machine rest evens out all criterions which are to be kept for precise shooting and it does it very well.

The other two catagories of headache are called secondary headaches and caused by frontal Lobe tumor, CVA, meningitis. and Temporal Arteries pain.  Secondary headaches require hospitalization  and extensive imaging to diagnose and most likely brain surgery.\n	 The treatment for primacy headaches- is to abort the headache, It is much easier when the migraine start and become difficult after it takes full swing. Primary can be acute or chronic and with or without aurora. An aura is flashing light, double vision, blind spot and begins 20 30 minutes before the onset of headache and subsides by the beginning of headache. Migrane headache gradually worsen from mild to severe. Migrane is caused among females more than males.  Children gets them too\nFor primary headaches the latest medication are Traptans catagories. Theses are serotonin agonist medications: here are some good migraine medications.   Sumatriptan 6 mg inject sub Q can be repeated in one hour later not to exceed two shots in 24 hours Sumatriptan also available in Nasal spray.\n          Next is Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg to 5 mg  PO not to exceed 10 mg/ 24 hours. \n	Dihydrergtoamine (DHE), a powerful venoconstritor The dose of 1-2 mg  IM usualy terminate migrane hadache. If the headache climaxed, in that case 5-10 mg Prochlorperazine IV is given first and then 2 mg Dihydrergtoamine IV should be  slowly given. This usualy will stop the headache.

Regarding the target, you''re measurements suggest that you''re using a standard NRA B-17 target (standard pistol precision/slow fire target for 25/50 m; with each ring being exactly 1 inch apart in radius)? If yes, then it also seems that you print your own targets and take only up to ring no. 5 and not all the way to ring no. 1? If not, then are you using the NRA B-37 target (standard pistol rapid fire target for 25 m), which has more distance between the rings and only goes up to ring no. 5.[/quote]\nIn all tests, I have used Standard 25M precision shooting target (B-17). Since my printer can only print up to a limited width, I take out the printouts up to 5 points. However, you would have seen in many places that I have included points less than 5. Those bullets which go a little outside the target but are still up to pt 1, I measure their distance from ring 5 and accordingly award the score.  \n\n[quote=MKKD]2. Your method also prescribes that the point of aim should always be the bull... Well, when I was testing the Baikal, aiming at the 6 o'' clock of the bull just didn''t work at all. I believe this is because the Baikal MP446 is a training and sporting model and therefore has a higher front sight. I was only able to hit the bull or near it when I was aiming at 12 o'' clock of ring no. 5 or 6 of the NRA B-17 target! I experimented this through a much more senior shooter, who came to the same conclusion... Could you please share what you POA was with the Baikal tests...?[/quote]\n[b]In all the tests I have aimed at the same place, ie, center of the bull.[/b] I am not sure about the Baikal that you fired, I have fired three Vikings and all of them were generally hitting in the center, ie, bull. I am strongly of this view (and I have already mentioned it more than once in this thread) that in order to determine the accuracy of the handgun, [b]the shooter must aim in the bull and let the gun fire wherever it does.  No effort should be made to adjust the fire by bringing it towards the bull even if one can clearly see the bullets going away.[/b]Now what is my rationale for this argument? I would like to explain it in some detail here :)\n\n[b]Technically speaking, the accuracy of a gun is indicated by the group that it forms. Smaller the group, more accurate the gun.[/b] However, if a small group is formed away from POA than it means an accurate gun with unadjusted / improperly aligned sites. Practically speaking, this aspect affects the final outcome of a firer effort, ie, his ability to engage a target accurately, hence an important factor to consider for fixed site guns (which most of the guns are). And as I have already mentioned in this thread, [b]it is very difficult for a common person or even a gunsimith to get the fixed sights zeroed.[/b] It is the job of a real expert like Skeeter60 or Dr Gundapur sahib who have spent their lives in this arena. It cant even be done by a good gunsmith unless he is using proper machines (sight mover etc) and has accurate idea of the extent of inaccuracy. Now, most guns from good manufacturers have their sights aligned with guns natural point of impact (the group) hence they produce good results out of the box. This however is not the case with an average manufacturer. [b]So as far as a common person is concerned, he must buy a pistol which fires accurate out of the box because adjustment of fix sights is normally a very difficult exercise.[/b] \n\n[b]During the test therefore, we must aim at the bull and let it fire wherever it does naturally. We would see that if a small group is formed but away from POA than the gun is accurate but not adjusted (which again is serious as I have already explained). If the group is large and also away from POA, the gun is no good and nothing can be done about it. [/b] Adjustment of fire with the purpose of bringing the bullets  close to the bull would, IMHO, defeat the very purpose of carrying out the accuracy test. In this case, it might become a firer''s test / performance whereas it is supposed to remain a handgun''s test :) \n\nAs for the rating in the tests, as you can see half the marks are for group and half are for precision shooting. Ruger Mk III test is a classic example of a accurate but non adjusted gun. But in the end, it came up because it scored very well in the group area. I would say that though the individual result of Ruger surely would have been better had it been properly zeroed, the test achieved what it was supposed to, ie, established Ruger Mk III as an extremely accurate gun. But Ruger had adjustable sights. In fixed sight pistol it cant be done hence my point of buying a gun which is accurate with well adjusted sights, out of the box.   \n\n\n\n\n[quote=MKKD] With my findings above, I''m not sure how this whole testing business can be made more reliable except that the shooter should be an expert, which is the cheapest solution but in fact a difficult one as we''ll have to wait around for the experts to share their test results... But even in that case, there would be a considerable margin of error and the results might not be considered absolute. By saying this I''m implying that although these tests will definitely give valuable information about a handgun''s accuracy, I don''t think we should do injustice to the guns by ranking them strictly. Any handguns falling in the very accurate/extremely accurate categories should be given preferance. I''m sure the expert shooter will be able to perform well with these handguns... [/quote]\nThough you have already read the disclaimer where I clearly wrote that neither these tests are most scientifically conducted tests to determine accuracy nor I am the best firer around, one may argue that if this is not a scientifically conducted accurate test which gives trustworthy results than why is Gilani sahib not only wasting everyone''s time but also his own time and ammo? The reason is that this is a voluntary effort where I have endeavoured to give some kind of tangible idea about the accuracy of a particular handgun which is not at all perfect but is better than nothing(becasue neither I am an expert firer nor I have ideal facilities available for conducting scientific tests) . For example, if a gun scores 68% in a test conducted by me than I am quite positive that if the test is conducted with a machine rest using handload ammo under controlled environment, the result might go to 75% or so but would neither go to 90% nor to 45% in my view. We would therefore have fairly nice idea of the accuracy of a handgun, though not an absolutely accurate one. \n\nAs for posting of results by experts, I absolutely agree with this and have been requesting that since the time I started this thread. It is very important to have diverse results / opinions because that will reduce chances of error / misjudgement. \n\n\n[quote=MKKD]Open for comments!\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqjU_b9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/jU_b9.jpg[/img][/url][/quote]\nI fully appreciate your effort here. However, my request / suggestion for the next test would be that even if the range guys do not allow a test from 10 M, do conduct them from 20 and 30 M. Reason is that with around 25 tests from 10, 20 and 30 M already posted, it has become a standard now. A result from any other distance would not be comparable and would find it difficult to draw the right conclusions. Secondly, please fire a group of 5 bullets only from one distance. With five bullets, one can have a fairly clear idea of MPI (mean point of impact). Firing more bullets may be counter productive. Save this ammo and use it for the second round with the same handgun.\n\nOnce again, thanks for your time and effort :)', 0, 1, '203.99.181.152', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 125464),

Better is to use the sight pusher instead of a hammer. [b]But it is easier said than done and to do it accurately with minimum of strikes is the job of a real expert lest one might end up damaging the sights of the handgun.[/b] And if you have noticed, it is done on the range, not in a workshop (unless workshop has its own firing range). One fires and adjusts.

[b]In fact this aspect has been the very source of motivation to start this thread. [/b]In Pakistan, we hardly have a dealer who would allow testing of the weapon by firing, one therefore cant test fire a weapon while buying. So a dealer would not allow firing of the weapon and even if he somehow allows firing of one weapon he will not allow a customer to test fire say three weapons and select the most accurate out of them. \nOne reasonably workable method is to compile a data base of firing results of different handguns. Through such data, one can draw a picture in his mind that for example hadgun A is in most cases very accurate out of the box whereas handgun B is average and handgun C is generally not very accurate out of the box. Still, there is no guarantee that the specific handgun  that one purchases would comply with the results of the tests, however, one would have a better idea based on some tangible results. :)', 0, 1, '203.99.181.152', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 125551),

Thumbs up to PsiFactor for arranging the meeting at such short notice. It was a very pleasant meeting as I found Dr saab extremely welcoming and helpful. Well first off, I am very glad to share with you that we have full support of Dr saab in our endeavour. He has welcomed all [b]responsible[/b] shooters to use his range HOWEVER, we still need to work out some details with him regarding the rules and regulations that will have to be observed at his range. The best incentive for all of us is that we will have the opportunity to learn the art of marksmanship from Dr saab himself! One consideration is that the range is around 30-40 mins drive from Peshawar city. He has also suggested to arrange a meeting of all interested shooters from Peshawar and surrounding areas at his range where we can discuss things at a later stage. We also discussed the option of us (as in the members/shooters) pooling in some money to fund a couple of supervisors at the range (preferably ex-army men who are well acquainted with target shooting); these supervisors will have the responsibility to maintain discipline and range safety regulations etc. I am very confident that this will ultimately lead to part of the solution especially until a full-fleged range/club is established. He also offered his help in contacting the provincial minister of sports Mr. Aqil Shah with regard to establishing a more equipped range in Peshawar city.\n\nWith regard to the FC range, we still intend to meet the IGFC...\n\nBesides this good news, PsiFactor and I had a go at some metal plates with PsiFactor''s CF98 :) so that added a little more spice to the meeting. In fact, that was the start of the meeting! Dr saab took us straight to the shooting point and we had our Bismillah there...\n\nSo here we go guys! after 49 posts I thing we are much closer to our goal than my first post! I''m very happy for all the fellow shooters with this very positive development. Of course this is not the end and we will continue our efforts until we reach a more plausible, practical and permanent solution. The future course of action in a sequential order:\n\n1. I''ll be meeting some other senior PG members tomorrow hopefully to further discuss this topic and get introduced rather informally;\n2. We will be meeting Dr saab again, perhaps more than once, to discuss the exact rules and regulations for using his range until a more permanent solution is reached;\n3. We will arrange a meeting of all Peshawar and surrounding areas PG members and other interested shooters at Dr saab''s range for a detailed breifing inshaAllah\n4. In parallel to the above, we will explore options for the meeting with the IGFC and the provincial minister of sports...\n\nFor now, as requested earlier, please send me your info (see post no. 45 above). This information is cruicial for our objective as it might help A LOT in making our case with the IGFC or the provincial minister of sports for a better range facility.

There are various logical reasons and justifications for doing so, that I complete agree with\n\nOne the other hand there is no shortcut to experience and if a mature and professional hunter will not transfer and share his experience to younger then every novice hunter will repeat the same mistakes and will only learn with the passage of time.\n\nI believe that this is a moral obligation on seniors to train juniors and this is only possible when seniors spend time with juniors in the field.

I wonder why most LEAs and Armies don''t read these reviews and select a better gun for them which is cheap, accurate, reliable and offers numerous extra features? Aquarius brother and his friend, both found PT845 quite inaccurate, but may be they got the lemons and now Taurus has improved? [b]The review gives the accuracy of PT845 at 2.68 inches and 2.75 inches group from 25 yards which is simply awesome and worthy of being a match / competition pistol.[/b] \n\n[b]Was just wondering about the authenticity of many such reviews.[/b] If one goes through the reviews of 24/7 Pro on the web, many reviews rate it extremely high though there are a few negative ones as well. My personal shooting experience with 24/7 (at least four of them) has always been awful. [b]One wonders how come there is so much of difference in the performance stated in reviews and the actual performance on ground.[/b] One actually starts thinking that am I an absolute dumb who has no idea what a handgun is? Or may be the one that I got was a lemon and others would be good? (These comments do not apply to Taurus 1911 and PT92/99 series pistols, who have proved themselves well in the arena)\n\n[b]I think Taurus have well appreciated the impact of internet on a common user and are exploiting it to its fullest.[/b] After having failed most trials for induction of their handguns in armies and LEAs, they are now focusing on individual buyers. They have known it well enough that most civilian buyers have average knowledge of the handguns, do not fire much and keep the guns well preserved for SD purpose only.  Therefore, those aspects that are revealed to the trial people of LEAs when they rough out their pistols would mostly not be exposed to a common civilian buyer. Hence the importance of good finish, impressive looks and extra features. Web reviews will take care of rest of the things :) \n\nYesterday, an acquaintance of mine was heard saying that he would buy a PT 809E, come what may. Someone (who is an old gun enthusiast and senior member of PG) advised him that Taurus handguns had mixed reviews and he might like to consider other options as well.

However, another fact to mention here is that all weapon companies who have prospered in this business have been able to get contracts from LEAs and armies. That is where the bulk order lies and more importantly, it does not finish with one order. It''s a continuous supply over the years. Just for example, Browning High Power has been used by around 30 different armies and even a bigger number of LEAs which over the years has resulted in production of millions of handguns. FN Herstal and Browning would have never been that successful had they targeted the individual customer. Just another angle to the same thing :) \n\n[quote=AK47]I''ll tell you [b]ONE[/b] thing guyz, if ever in the foreseeable future, Taurus DOES come over these quality issues, matching FUNCTIONALITY and AESTHETICS to come at par,  their guns will be the most popular ones in the world with respect to price and beauty. [/quote]\nAgain fully agreed. But to do this, in my personal view, Taurus has to remain focused on what they want to do. Now Taurus is in habit of releasing too many models (with minor changes off course) every year. Have a look at the top companies like Colt, H&K, Beretta, Sig Sauer, Browning etc. They have worked on very few models but have brought those models to perfection. One can just compare the data that how many models H&K or Beretta has released in the past ten years and how many Taurus has released during the same time. Perfection can''t be achieved with so many handguns around because the effort gets diluted as each handgun takes some investment in R&D etc. I think Taurus should select few of their best models and than focus on improving them more and more, bringing them at par with other top models.  \n\n\n\n[quote=KageFox]As you stated, if you look up reviews of the 24/7 and its brethren, you''ll notice much positive feedback, at times much to the surprise of the reviewer.

[/quote]\nSir, at same time one would also find many comments in independent forums in USA where the individual users were fed up with the ammo sensitivity of Taurus guns and they were also firing high end ammo brands available in USA. \nThat is where I get doubtful about these apparently very scientifically written reviews which seems to be very different from the opinion of common users. \n\nI am a shooter and I know very well that making a 2.68 inches or 2.75 inches group consistently with a 4 inch barrel handgun from 25M is not easy and can only be done with a very high quality handgun with match components fitted in it. A normal combat handgun usually does not perform to this standard. Frankly, I would like to see the video of the reviewer who made 2.68 and 2.75 inches groups using a Taurus PT845 :)   \n\n\n[quote=KageFox]Anyone on this forum who has (dared to :D) shoot the 24/7 with only non-POF ammo?

I agree with you that Viking is better than Glock in two aspects, one the ability of firing very hot loads and secondly, the quality of trigger (I am talking about off the market Glocks and not customised Glocks). Though 7N21 is not available to civilian users (at least not in Pakistan) and we would never know what difference it makes practically, nevertheless, this capability of Viking makes it very reliable and durable with all types of ammo that we get in Pakistan. On the other hand, Glock has never been known as the best gun for firing hotter loads. \n\nThe other advantage of Viking is its price which is four to six times less than the price of Glock. \n\n[b]However, in my personal reckoning, Glock 17 is more accurate than Viking and is excellent for combat shooting / fast engagement of multiple targets.[/b] Baikal also has natural pointability which helps in quick engagement of multiple targets however, Glock is comparatively more accurate. \n\nMoreover, cheap availability of after market parts is a great advantage, though not in Pakistan but in other parts of the world. :) Even in Pakistan, it is easier to get Glock accessories as compared to most other high end handguns. \n\nWhere Viking can not beat Glock in Pakistan is the reputation / psychological ascendancy that Glock enjoys and Viking so far does not. When a user is using Glock, he is very confident that he is using a very reliable and top class handgun. Viking, though reputed very well, has not been able to attain this level of confidence with the user. I know its nothing practical rather something psychological, nevertheless, it matters in Pakistan because Glock has become kind of a status symbol. \n\nGlock is certainly better in finish which I feel Baikal guys really need to improve in case of Viking.\n\nCZ999 Scorpion, I agree, is a great pistol which is very accurate, solid and reliable. We are lucky to get it cheap in Pakistan. :) \n\nJust my two cents on the subject :)', 0, 1, '119.153.65.35', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3091, 126321),

The holster fits perfectly, and lies flat against the body but tends to slide on the belt while worn, due to softness of the material used. We figured that if that design were replicated in a harder material like leather, this issue would be solved. Unfortunately, Abba cannot easily make a leather holster due to lack of proper equipment.\n\nWe did try to get a leather version made through dealer friend of his, but the company approached refused... apparently they wanted a larger order than just a single piece.\n\nCan it be done?[/quote]\n\nBro if u provide he sample it can be done. And i have somthing to share with all of u guys and especially the ones who ask for a holster in a softer material. Bros if softer material is used the holster and the belt hangs and has a short useful life as a metal handgun is carried in it. The standard way of holster is using a stronger and harder material which can withstand the weight of the handgun.

[b]My answer would be a big no.[/b] However, people in Pakistan (including me) not only have confidence in Glock, it has become sort of a status symbol. This is an important factor when it comes to buying a handgun, specially for those who can afford. Viking and CZ999 on the other hand are considered cheap guns which offer good quality in less price. Ironically, Glock enjoys the same status in US. :lol: Logically, it may not be a strong argument but it matters here :)\n\nOn accuracy part however, I would say that Glock and CZ999 are comparable and better than Viking\n\n\n[quote=Luger]so  for  less  money  you  can  have  golden  cz  99  than  black  sig  226\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PquOYjS][img]http://s3.postimage.org/uOYjS.jpg[/img][/url][/quote]\nWow, I would love to have this beauty, anytime, everytime. :P I wonder why this gun is not exported to Pakistan :rolleyes:\n\n\n[quote=Luger]polymer  is  not  and  hardly  ever  will  be  strong  as  steel,  also  aluminum.[/quote]\nAbsolutely agreed.

[/b]\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5880.jpg[/img] \nThe bull is 1 inch radius, each subsequent ring is 1 inch apart. From the center of the bull to the outer line of 1 ring (outermost ring) is 10 inches and total diameter of the target is 20 inches. For better aiming, colour of bull and upto ring 7 is black with white line. From 6 ring to 1 ring, colour is white with black lines. \nThis is target is used for deliberate fire or precision shooting or bulls eye shooting from 25 M. \n\n\n[b]This is NRA 25 M Pistol Rapid Fire Target[/b]\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5947.jpg[/img]\nBull is 2 inch(5 cm) radius. Each circle is 1.6 (4 cm) apart and goes upto No 5 circle. Radius from center of the bull to the end of 5 ring is 10 inches and total width of the target is 20 inches. This target is used for rapid fire from 25 M.\n\n\nThe targets shown above are standard NRA targets. The paper is quite thick. However, these are quite expensive. One can use them in the matches but for daily practice, one may like to shoot on cheaper targets. \n\nFor routine practice,one may get targets printed on computer. If you look at the target below, its a precision target but up to No 5 circle only.  A normal printer can not print more than this. Even in this target, three papers have been joined to make one target. The dimensions are same but up to No 5 circle only.\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5943.jpg[/img]\n\nSame target but this is an economy pack where i order to save printer ink, the coloured circles are up to No 8 circle only. :)\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5979.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\nIf one does not have a large size printer, it''s quite a hassle to take printout on 2 pages and than join them. One may get targets printed like the ones shown below. It would cost around Rs 6 per target.

I have this option in mind. however the problem with rifled chokes is that there is no such thing as "one size fits all". therefore their availability in the market is next to impossible if not totally impossible. on the other hand, desi shotgun are rarely provided with threads to be used with chokes. so I guess rifled choke option goes out the window for desi shotguns.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.152.202', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1209, 126663),

However, [b]they have one grave drawback[/b] because of which, despite its inherent inclination towards accuracy, rotating barrel design has not been adopted by most top weapon manufacturers (you can count that how many rotating barrel pistols have been manufactured so far?). [b]That drawback is the alignment of feed ramp with the chamber.[/b] Feed ramp is not located on the barrel in a rotating barrel mechanism. Due to this, even if there is a slight mis-alignment of feed ramp with the barrel, the feeding of the bullet may not take place correctly. This affects the reliability of the pistol. I have experienced  this problem both in CF98 and in Stoeger Cougar (more in CF98) but its not to an alarming extent. It''s occasional, say one out of 100 or 200 bullets. Depends how clean the weapon is, quality of ammo etc. [b]Even in today''s test, there was one failure to feed.[/b] IMHO, CF98 and Stoeger Cougar, though excellent guns otherwise, will always have these occasional feeding problems because of the location of feed ramp on the connector. Perhaps that is the reason that Sig, Colt, H&K, Glock, S&W, CZ, Walther and many other top brands do not have any model with rotating barrel. In fact as per my knowledge, there are only three pistols with rotating barrel being manufactured nowadays; PX4 Storm, Stoeger Cougar and CF98.\n \nNevertheless, rotating barrel pistols are more accurate but are not the most accurate. The most accurate design in my view is the fixed barrel mechanism that you find in Makarov, Walther PPK, Steyer GB etc. Fixed barrel also has its own problems in other areas and is not suitable for powerful ammos like 9x19 parabellum and upwards :). That is why you find this design in low potency ammos like .22, .32 ACP, .380 ACP, 9x18 Makarov etc (less Steyer GB which is in 9x19 para).

These are spring mounted snap caps, so the incremental wear may be less and less. I''ll report again when we feel one is dead. \n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Snap%20Caps/DSC_0121.jpg[/img]\n\nAnother thing illustrated below is wear because of repeatedly sliding the most used cap into the magazine vs the unused one\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Snap%20Caps/DSC_0122.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '124.109.59.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4783, 127178),

In each, the four safety rules were observed as follows:\n1- The weapon was double checked for clearance by each of us. The live rounds were counted, put back in their box and stored in a different location in the house\n2- Dry firer''s and observer''s postions were selected such that there was never an arc of motion that covered either person\n3- The only time the fingers were on the trigger were when the weapon was indexed on the target with an acquired sight picture\n4- The back stop was a concrete wall. No possibility of accidental penetration. If that!\n\n[b]Practicing marksmanship. Building the case for dry fire practice:[/b]\n1. Aligning sights and putting them over the target to acquire sight picture, acheiving minimum arc of motion and exercising breath control. Just this, repeated over and over is a great great practice tool. You start getting ready on the target sooner and more predictably\n2. Achieving surprise trigger break from both a double action and a single action pull without flinching or disrupting sight alignment. Since the weapon doesn''t cycle, you can''t do a string of uninterrupted SA shots. DA, you can but that isn''t useful or even valid practice espcially for DA/SA guns. Certainly not for the Cougar\n3. Follow through. Deliberately keeping the trigger pressed all the way to the rear while mentally ''reacquiring'' the target (although the gun stays on target. You just simulate this)\n4. Trigger reset. Again, the trigger always resets to DA mode and we have to be wary of ingraining this too deeply. Actual range time with live fire is paramount\n\nIt can be rightly said that all this can be achieved without snap caps. However, the marginal benefit here is that you administratively load your weapon before getting ready to fire which simulates your range preparation for fire better than an empty weapon. When done, the drill is, you clear the weapon much the same way as you would on the range\n\nThe real benefits of snap caps will be covered in a subsequent post to follow soon, hopefully', 0, 1, '124.109.59.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4783, 127180),
