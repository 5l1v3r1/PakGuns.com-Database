If anyone wishes to share his contact information with others I believe it should be his own prerogative and not a necessity. We are not a government or controlling body, we are a group of friends who are striving to promote our great sport and watch the interests of our brothers in the community. \n\nI always try to have the best interests of my friends here at heart and for that reason have always requested members for their own safety and to avoid any awkward situation not share their contact details unless they have met the other member in person at a GTG. We must all realize that we are into a very serious sport which unfortunately does attract some negative elements as well so proceeding with caution is a must. \n\nOn another note as we have seen with so many things in our country that because of one miscreant, millions others face daily inconveniences and loss of freedom of expression and privacy, I don''t want that on our forum.

There are many used guns available in .32ACP and .22LR but they, in my view, are not potent man stoppers. In 9x18 we have Makarov, in 9x19 we have Taurus Millennium Pro and in .45 ACP we have PT145 and that''s about it. There may be few more available here and there but one would have to search. I went for a Mak because its a time tested weapon which would challenge any limits of reliability and robustness. Is very accurate too. PT145 is also good if you feel comfortable with .45 ACP ammo with such a small gun. I didn''t but that was my personal experience. I would not really recommend Millennium Pro, the earlier models had many issues. But I can''t say anything about the latest models of Millennium Pro.

There is also another brand called BSA England which is the same case as Parker Hale, locally assembled but it is around 2-4k higher in price then Parker Hale.[/quote]\n\nI totally agree with ur comments regarding Brno, Taimur i would suggest u to go for Brno ZKK 600 as it will give u 100% satisfaction what u can have in a price range of 60 - 70K Rs. Accurate & Reliable but the Bolt is not as smooth as the Winchester etc etc. In BSA u will face the mount problem as the mount for BSA 7mm are not easily available here. i am using Brno''s above said model from last 4 years and i am totally satisfy with its accuracy.', 0, 1, '115.167.98.227', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5166, 141720),

Reference ([url]http://www.sksboards.com/smf/index.php?topic=36794.0[/url]).\n\nSince its seems a common topic I am going to make this a general rundown and put in the FAQ section. \n\nChrome lined barrels are generally thought of as trading accuracy for longevity, and that would be correct generally, but not specifically.  In other words just because its chrome lined doesn''t mean it wont shoot well, or that if its not chromed it won''t last.  \n_\n1st off,  a primer on how barrels are made. More indepth explanation can be found here - [url]http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/barrel_making/making_rifle_barrel.htm[/url]\n\nA barrel starts out as a chunk of specifically heat treated round bar stock of chrome moly steel. To get the required hardness of 4140 or 4150 they add harder (and denser) elements of Chromium and Molybdenum within the steel as its smelted.  410 or more commonly 416 stainless  is also used on a lot of barrels, being relatively the same hardness as 4140 chrome moly steel. From the forging company, usually about 1" in diameter for small arms, but varies depending on what the purpose is.  These are purchased in bulk lengths by barrel makers, cut to length and bored under size to whatever spec the caliber is.  This is done on a deep bore drill, basically a specialized mill.  Then the blank is rifled.  To get the bore to the correct diameter, they use reaming, to improve consistency of the bore and produce a smoother finish than the higher speed drill leaves.  Its the reaming process that has impact on accuracy on most barrels, some barrels are not reamed at all, just inspected for minimum tolerance and sent out.  Some are reamed once, and others are reamed several times depending on the specs they are building to.\n\nNext comes rifling.  The oldest method was to actually cut the rifling one groove at a time into a barrel. The most common  rifling now is called button rifling. Its made by pushing a football shaped plug with the grooves on it through the bore which pushes the metal of the barrel to form the rifling.    Another way is called  hammer forging, where they insert a full length plug with the grooves and hammer the outside of the barrel so it forms around the plug.  (Read more on it here - Hammer forging)  All of these produce a traditional flat groove style rifling.  There is another style that is a non edged type instead of the square edged type called polygonal rifling, it produces a smoother bore with flat "lands" that induce the bullet to spin.  Glock is one maker who uses this type.\n\nAfter rifling, some barrel makers will lap the barrel at this point. Armalite claims to lap their barrels before going to chroming to improve consistency of the rifling and bore.  \n\nAfter rifling the chrome layer process is completed. It basically puts a layer of chrome down on the interior of the barrel and welds it to the steel, chrome is roughly twice as hard as 4150 steel.   If done correctly it should never separate like chrome does on  bumper, its not a separate layer but bonded.  They do have to accommodate the extra thickness of the chrome layer, so they slightly oversize bores for barrels intended for chroming.  \n\n_\n\nThis is why chrome lined barrels tend to not be as accurate.  Any time you put a layer of something over an contour, it magnifies it, so any imperfection in the barrel surface is made more so with the extra layer that adds to the surface.  There was in the early days of chrome lining process problems keeping the lining thickness uniform as well, though the process has become much more automated and a lot of that has ceased to be an issue. \n\nFor normal shooters, chrome lining is not an accuracy killer. The barrel quality control underneath the lining is far more critical than the lining itself.  In many cases the lining being an accuracy issue is only one to those like match shooters trying to shave 1/4 MOA off groups. \n  \nThe main advantage of Chrome is being much harder and impervious than 4150 steel, will hold up to wear a lot longer giving a much longer effective lifespan of a barrel.  Its also much easier to clean as powder residue and lead will not work into the pores, like it does in bare steel.  \n\nHowever a chrome lined barrel can still wear and reduce accuracy quickly depending on the use its subjected to.   Most wear occurs in the throat, where the most heat and contact friction is, if the wear is sufficient it can cause the bullet be less stable as it  travels down the barrel, even chrome lined rifles will have reduced practical accuracy life in full auto use. \nChrome lining also does not protect the crown, which can have a major impact of accuracy of a barrel.  \n\nThe bottom line is, for any utility or defense rifle there is no reason to not opt for chrome lining where offered.  But its not necessary either.

Its also much easier to clean as powder residue and lead will not work into the pores, like it does in bare steel.  [/b]\n\n[b]However a chrome lined barrel can still wear and reduce accuracy quickly depending on the use its subjected to.   Most wear occurs in the throat, where the most heat and contact friction is, if the wear is sufficient it can cause the bullet be less stable as it  travels down the barrel, even chrome lined rifles will have reduced practical accuracy life in full auto use. \nChrome lining also does not protect the crown, which can have a major impact of accuracy of a barrel.  [/b]\n\n[b]The bottom line is, for any utility or defense rifle there is no reason to not opt for chrome lining where offered.  But its not necessary either.

I use carbide so I forget about the lubrication.\n\nAlso, you must periodically inspect the dies for damage and clean them.  Also, every 50 - 100 rounds or so you will want to check everything:  measure overall length, weigh the powder charge, meaure the crimp, inspect the primer seating.\n\nAnd, if you find something out of specification, stop, remove all possible suspect bulelts, break them down and start over after correcting the problem.

Baikal got some complaints regarding bursting or KABOOM ? these are all my doubts I don''t have any information regarding all this because I am completely satisfied with my Viking MP 446 after firing 1800 rounds so far in less then 3 months , Baikal don''t allow the importers from any other country to import the pistols unless the demand is 500 handguns so what happens here is that one dealer imports these guns and distributes among others according to their demand , I am also scared of clones but so far I didn''t come across any in market it took almost 4 years of hard work to copy Glock lets see how much our brothers in darra take now to copy MP 446 , so far I am 95% sure there is no clone of MP 446 in market ,', 0, 1, '119.154.131.34', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4983, 142168),

In combination with suitable weapons, the 6.5x25 CBJ covers the full range of applications traditionally covered by everything from pistols up to and in most cases including short assault rifles, and offers high firepower and superior penetration and wounding power at full combat ranges in any combat situation.\n\nAccording to the criteria for weapon effectiveness stated above, the following applies for the 6.5x25 CBJ cartridge system:\n\nHit probability is increased because of the low recoil generated, allowing rapid firing at high precision, and in the case of fully automatic weapons, the ability to fire accurate bursts. Also, at longer ranges and at moving targets the high retained velocity of the bullet with resulting flat trajectory and short time of flight to the target reduces the need of compensation, which greatly simplifies aiming.\n\nThe required penetration depends on the situation. For instance, the combat soldier generally needs more penetration than the average police officer. Within the 6.5x25 CBJ cartridge family, the entire spectrum of penetration is covered, from maximum penetration against tough targets to minimum penetration against unprotected targets in sensitive environments.\nThe different variants of the 6.5x25 CBJ have high energy and effective means to transfer it to soft tissue, resulting in a high wounding effect. \n\nThe 6.5x25 CBJ cartridge is of course primarily intended to be used in weapons designed and optimized for this caliber. However it is also designed to be used in 9x19 Parabellum weapons, converted by barrel change to the 6.5x25 CBJ. The cartridge generates the same level of impulse as the 9x19 Parabellum, which assures functioning of the weapons. The bolt face, groove and cartridge case up to the shoulder of the 6.5x25 CBJ are identical to the 9x19 Parabellum, as is the total length of the cartridge, 29.7mm.\n\nThis makes the transition to the new caliber easy. Another benefit is that existing stocks of 9x19 Parabellum ammunition can still be used for training instead of being scrapped.\n\nThere are many different potential users for the 6.5x25 CBJ, primarily within the military and law enforcement sector, with accordingly different demands. This includes personnel armed with pistol or PDW for personal defense and regular police units, as well as units with offensive tasks, like SWAT, Special Forces, units specialized in urban warfare, Security Forces etc.\n\nIn order to be highly effective in all situations, the 6.5x25 CBJ has several cartridge alternatives, none of which contains any toxic material.\n\nFor training, there are cost effective alternatives. For combat, there are different cartridge alternatives depending on the situation and desired performance.\n\nThe development of the combat ammunition has followed a number of criteria, mainly:\n\n[list=*]\n[*]The bullet shall be effective within the entire desired combat range \nIt must be able to penetrate any reasonable barrier typical for the application without breaking apart \nAfter penetrating such barriers it has to be able to penetrate at least 30cm of soft tissue to cause reliable ncapacitation from any angle of impact \nAfter achieving the above, it shall have as high energy transfer to the target as possible.[/*]\n[/list]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq9Ki_9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/9Ki_9.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '119.154.56.171', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5195, 142513),

Everyone Thought to share my review about the beautiful masterpiece and the world''s top ten pistol Sig Sauer P226 its the famous model of Sig and what i would say about Sig is they make guns which are built to last. I am a Sig lover the balance of Sig pistol is excellent i drove it up a few days back and i found this pistol a perfect one it can be used as a match pistol SD or HD as well one thing i want to add here clearly is most of this model we have in Pakistan is without SRT (Short Reset Trigger) The one i drove is with SRT. The old models where having normal trigger and excellent trigger too ..But the technology change by the company to SRT is advanced and much better than the previous one (SRT). This pistol can fit most hands. If i will be getting Glock and Sig for the same prices i would go for SIG\n\nWell Couldn''t bring the chart along but surely will show up the range review very very soon.\nLets Start the features of this weapon\n[b]Accuracy :- Its a very accurate pistol and it has very nice grouping  I would rate its accuracy as 9/10\nReliability :- No doubt for the reliability an no need to ask in Sig pistols it goes 10/10[/b]\n\n[b]Trigger:- I would rate it higher because mostly in triggers we see a lot of pull in many pistol but in this pistol its perfect ya it weighs 5.5 lbs but i felt it 4 - 4.5 lbs and i would rate it 9/10[/b]\n\n[b]Recoil:- Recoil is good it has a normal recoil not low felt recoil just fine and i would rate it 8/10[/b]\n\n[b]Assembly/Disassemble :- It is very easy to operate its assembling disassembling and i would rate it 10/10[/b]\n\n[b]Design:- Now that''s where is the important part the Design of this pistol is excellent and perfect i would say i love the design of this pistol its built like a tough tank and wear and tear is awesome..This pistol design is in aluminum and steel with a very fine finish.. I love this pistol because of the wear and tear and that''s what makes me thing to go on it for..I would give it 9/10 just one reason not that beautiful that''s all other thing and the best part of this pistol its built[/b]\n\n[b]Overall I Rate this Gun 9/10\n[/b]\nI hope there are many People holding this pistol they can add on more spice about this pistol and i want users of this pistols to kindly post also their pics as well as their suggestion and review whereas this pics were taken by me again and this pistol also belongs to our Friend and member Bloodbath and soon he is gonna gift it to me;)\n\nHere you go with the pics \nThis pistol has company fitted night sights and 20 rounds magazine along with it this was not along with the company package but was upgraded from the Company itself\n\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03454.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03463.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03462.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03461.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03460.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03459.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03458.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03457.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03455.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '110.37.9.239', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5196, 142552),

I remember when i got myself my first GSD pup i saw him at the age of 4 weeks. the parents were perfect. He was Ben''s son, and Ben was a direct desendant of Ring tin tin, easy rider must have heard of him. Well picking out the puppy was the hard part. Then this friend of mine who accompanied me, asked the owneer to feed the pups..all the pups rushed over to the feeding bowl, but this one pup, in the very end got up, walked over to the bowl..pushed and growled at every other of his sibling, had a few bites than sat on the bowl. and somehow i knew i found myself the alpha of the pack. he turned out to be a wonderful dog. big strong and healthy. yes it was a little aggressive around strangers, but a wonderful pet nonetheless.', 0, 1, '115.186.71.93', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1271, 142964),

Both of these technologies rely on the usage of large battery arrays. It would be better if the batteries used are the newer gel batteries (maintenance free, longer life) rather than the more common lead-acid batteries.\n\nAs regards to expense... the solar power project does take, IMHO, a hefty amount to start off. A supplier of cheap solar panels would get things moving more quickly. However, as stated earlier, the initial expense pays off itself in some time...\n\nRecently, I have seen a few wind turbines installed on rooftops in my area. Rumor has it that KESC does not want consumers generating their own electric power, and are acting to prevent people from becoming independent on KESC...[/quote]\n\ni read somewhere not remembering it right now is that as per policy/ rules whenever some one installs alternative energy he needs to submit it to kesc through the main power line and in returrn the kesc will adjust your monthly bill accordingly.. it means no one can use the alternative energy system by having its out put diectly at their home but instead that needs to be connected to direct kesc lines[/quote]\n\n\nHave heard the same news.

Secondly in my humble knowledge, it is nowhere in black and white mentioned that you cannot keep a dog. thirdly, how do u specify the boundaries of your home. if you keep a dog in a kennel in your lawn, i presume the lawn is a part of your home. Therefore go right a head and get yourself a dog. Dont worry about a pedigree, for starters just buy a dog. you will learn. its the same as when you buy your first handgun, you hear alot from people, you read their expiriences, but its not the same as when you fire it yourself. How you relate to your dog is solely upon your own bond with the animal. Brother EasyRider would agree with me, every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself. i have kept pedigreed & non-pedigreed GSDs, rotts, dobermen, a mastiff and i have kept and raised stray dogs also. All of my dogs including the strays have left me with lasting memories and stories that i can narrate the whole day without tiring. So please go ahead and get one, i am sure you would thank yourself one day for adopting that animal.\n\n@ExihibitionshooterHamza, Sir with all due respect, the thing pointed out by easyrider was something that i thought off also when i saw the pics. To be honest Easyriders comment was not to put you down, it was only in the best interest of the animal. So dont take comments from people so hard on yourself. I have gotten into fist fights with people over stonning of stray dogs. And one more thing, after having been around dogs since i was 3 years old, one thing error of yours i can point out with all my authority, NEVER PUT YOUR DOG ON A LEASH WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING HIM. Dogs belong to the family of wolves, they like to move around when they are eating. So give him his bowl and let him off the leash.\n\n@EasyRider, brother i like the way you handle you pet.

Secondly in my humble knowledge, it is nowhere in black and white mentioned that you cannot keep a dog. thirdly, how do u specify the boundaries of your home. if you keep a dog in a kennel in your lawn, i presume the lawn is a part of your home. Therefore go right a head and get yourself a dog. Dont worry about a pedigree, for starters just buy a dog. you will learn. its the same as when you buy your first handgun, you hear alot from people, you read their expiriences, but its not the same as when you fire it yourself. How you relate to your dog is solely upon your own bond with the animal. Brother EasyRider would agree with me, every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself. i have kept pedigreed & non-pedigreed GSDs, rotts, dobermen, a mastiff and i have kept and raised stray dogs also. All of my dogs including the strays have left me with lasting memories and stories that i can narrate the whole day without tiring. So please go ahead and get one, i am sure you would thank yourself one day for adopting that animal.\n\n@ExihibitionshooterHamza, Sir with all due respect, the thing pointed out by easyrider was something that i thought off also when i saw the pics. To be honest Easyriders comment was not to put you down, it was only in the best interest of the animal. So dont take comments from people so hard on yourself. I have gotten into fist fights with people over stonning of stray dogs. And one more thing, after having been around dogs since i was 3 years old, one thing error of yours i can point out with all my authority, NEVER PUT YOUR DOG ON A LEASH WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING HIM. Dogs belong to the family of wolves, they like to move around when they are eating. So give him his bowl and let him off the leash.\n\n@EasyRider, brother i like the way you handle you pet. If you are ever in Karachi, let me know, would love to meet up with a like minded doglover. my email address is [email]fahad_khalid101@hotmail.com[/email][/quote]\n\n+1\nvery well said bro\nAll creatures are the creation of Allah Taala and do deserve the recognition of being a creation of the Almighty. As much as Muslims detest even the sight of pigs - it is the creation of Allah Taala - and because Allah has placed life into it, we cannot inflict pain nor torture the pig.\n\nSimilarly Allah Taala created the dog from among His creation. Allah Taala the Creator of this Universe - having created the dog would surely have known that the dog requires Human affection and love to exist in this world.This does not mean that you hate dogs, Yes there are some boundaries defined like not to touch a dog when he is wet, his saliva is impure, do not mouth them like people do in western countries, as Fahad bro said, just go and get a dog :) Pedigree doesn''t matter, pedigree is just a certificate that how pure a dog is, and believe me you dont need that :) and as fahad said [b]every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself.[/b] if you keep any dog believe me its gonna change the way you live your life, So keep a dog, your routine will automatically be changed, There''ll be a time when you get busy in your life, you will have no time for your hobbies, If not now, then never :)', 0, 1, '116.71.189.81', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1271, 143559),

A hang fire also you need to know why,they can be dangerous\n\nSpent and misfired shotgun cartridge disposal\nAdvice on disposal of domestic and commercial quantities of spent shotgun cartridges and misfired shotgun cartridges.\nWhat sort of waste are spent shotgun cartridges?\nAccording to guidance from the Environment Agency (EA), spent shotgun cartridges are classed as a ‘Directive Waste’. The phrase “Directive Waste” refers to European legislation called the Waste Framework Directive. Directive wastes include nearly all household, commercial and industrial wastes. Directive wastes have to be assessed as to whether they are classed as ‘Hazardous Waste’ or ‘Non-hazardous Waste’ according to a set of criteria under the Waste Framework Directive. Even though spent shotgun cartridges contain lead (hazardous substance) residues, lead is not present in the quantities required for it to be classed as a ‘Hazardous Waste’.   Spent shotgun cartridges are therefore classed as a ‘Non-hazardous’ waste and are subject to the regulations governing non-hazardous waste.\n\nDomestic quantities:\nLocal authorities are responsible for the removal and management of domestic household waste. Based on guidance from the EA, small quantities of cartridges can be deposited in normal domestic household waste*. No official policy exists to define the limits of ‘small quantities’, however the EA suggests anything up to 100 cartridges is reasonable. Local authorities have a duty of care to remove non-hazardous, directive waste, which spent cartridges are. Any problems encountered by the removal of spent shotgun cartridges in your domestic waste needs to be addressed with the local authority responsible.\n\nCommercial quantities:\nDisposal of large quantities of spent shotgun cartridges are subject to the new agricultural waste regulations (further details on the EA website). Under these regulations disposal of large quantities of spent shotgun cartridges by burning or burial is illegal. The EA recommends contacting a local waste recycling company to arrange removal.\n\nDuty of care in relation to commercial quantities of cartridges\nDuty of care applies to everyone handling trade waste, which includes commercial shoots. If you break the duty you are liable to an unlimited fine.\n\nDuty of care means that you have to take all reasonable steps to keep the waste safe. For example safe storage of spent cartridges might be in large bins or a skip. Duty of care also means that the waste must be properly disposed of. That means contacting a company authorised to dispose of it properly.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is by entering into a contract with the local authority to take the waste away. You can also give it to a registered waste carrier. A company called Solway Recycling offers services for collection of large quantities of spent shotgun cartridges throughout the country, for further information contact [url=http://www.solwayrecycling.co.uk]www.solwayrecycling.co.uk[/url] . It is the responsibility of the waste producer to check that Solway recycling is a registered waste carrier.\n\nIn addition waste producers need to sign a waste transfer notice, saying what the waste is and how it is stored.\n\nDisposal of live/misfired shotgun cartridges:\nContact your local police firearms licensing authority who can collect live or misfired cartridges and dispose of them. The Health and Safety Executive also provides guidance on disposal of large quantities of live or misfired ammunition. DO NOT dispose of live or misfired cartridges through domestic waste, burial or burning - it is illegal and dangerous.\n\n* No guidance has been issued by the Department of Environment Northern Ireland for disposal of domestic quantities of spent cartridges. \n\nNB BASC does not accept responsibility for any misinterpretation of guidance. It is the responsibility of members to familiarise themselves with the regulations for each of the countries in the UK. For further information on waste regulations contact the Environment Agency (England and Wales), Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Scotland) or Department of Environment (Northern Ireland).

They were geniuses but also had childhood mental illness called Attention Deficient Hyperactivity disorder or ADHD. Einstein and other could not pass their grade school and according to different sources Einstein almost was expelled from the third grade because being daydreaming and not paying attention in the class. Thomas Edison could n’t sit still in the class and had no concentration and his education ended with three months schooling and kicked out from the school, yet had over 1000 patent to his name. Winston Churchill was at the bottom of his 4th grade class and changed three schools blaming the teachers were no good, yet became the savior of England at the hand of Hitler.\n	So, what was going on with these people? They had ADHD, now we know. Usualy starting at age three, ADHD child is overly hyper, fidget, fails to pay attention, make careless errors, neither follow through on instructions nor complete the tasks, trouble organizing school work or task, frequently looses pens, Pencils, tools needed for activities, easily distracted by external activities, inappropriately run around, climbs, always on the go (driven), and talks excessively, never let anyone talk and blurt out answers before question is finished.\n	Theses children are labeled as “lazy, low intelligent, incapable of learning, and rebellious”. ADHD was discovered in 1902 but not diagnosed as a mental disorder until now, and had no proper treatment. It was assumed that child with this disorder will not be anything but a common laborer and will not be able to read or write let alone will become scientist and inventor.\n	Psychiatry had come logway to understand this disorder. we now understand  ADHD and is treated successfully. Still, we have do n’t know what causes this disorder. In my professional opinion, when teacher complain about a child student is being lazy or poor learner, the parents should  consult   a capable doctor for exact reasoning why a child is performing poorly in the school.[/quote]', 0, 1, '24.156.114.9', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4764, 143639),

I cant recall the phosphorus content right now but talk to the plater he can guide you as per your requirement. some versions of electroless nickel are as hard as industrial chrome and offers superior corrosion protection. not to mention it looks way more beautiful than industrial chrome.\n\nas far as external finish is concerned, you can go for bluing. its time tested. quiet easy. any good gun smith can do it for you or you could do it by purchasing a home bluing kit. you could also do parkerizing but that I would not recommend it as its not as classy nor as soft to the hands as bluing. plus its just too much work and the juice is not worth the squeeze.\n\nstay away from chrome plating when you''re thinking about external finish of the firearm. it looks cheap and is prone to pitting (rust in the forms of pits).\n\nwhat else? what else? hmm... before your project lifts off. I would recommend take the piece to any competent gunsmith, discuss your options with him. he can guide you alot. then take the best route there is.\n\nBEST OF LUCK.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.147.239', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5228, 144048),

Not our issue, theirs, but still.\n\nLooking forward to some real facts.\n\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE] \n\nThe revalidation exercise has nothing to do with having the statistics of quota of MNA or senators consumed rightly or in excess brother. They do have the data. But let me tell u the background and every one who reads newspaper regularly  knows it as it was a well covered news story of its time . U may remember that supreme courts C.J ordered a probe in the matter of excessive issuance of licenses by MOI , and when high &#8211;ups in MOI just conducted the inquiry superficially ,  glaring fact emerged that nearly 35000 fake licenses have been issued. The method of issuance was in a manner that had  the instructions by the the court  were not issued, such fact would never have surfaced because the booklets issued were genuine and the formal signatures  put on the licenses  were genuine too. Actually these licenses were issued in  the collaboration of lower formation of concerned section and in those licenses , the most important factor, the factor that makes the licenses genuine , means the approval of Prime Minister was lacking . Pursuant to revelation of this fact, the FIRs were also registered against those who were found responsible , interestingly , the person in whose incumbency the largest number of fake licenses were issued , didn&#8217;t belong to relevant service cadre ,rather he belongs to health services, who made his way to federal bureaucracy through marrying a  high ranking federal officer .The number of fake licenses was so huge that serious doubts and reservations were shown by the deciding corners about the ability of present license issuing system to prevent any future mishap of corresponding  magnitude and it was for the first time  that NADRA was brought in to consideration . MOI  reportedly has the data of rightly issued  licenses- , but how to retrieve the fake licenses?...... naturally the revalidation process was the only way out. Now , after taking the photocopy of license, NADRA would send it back to MOI and if that license has the proper documentation and the approval of competent authority back at MOI, the owner would be issued the card license, otherwise&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;?. Here comes the question of a million dollars that what shall be the fate of  the persons whose licenses are not verified in the process . in my opinion there are 2 categories of  that kind of licensees (1) the persons who already know that their licenses will not be verified, thus , naturally they wont opt to undergo the revalidation process means they wont bring their licenses to NADRA centers. (2) the licensees who got their licenses prepared through agents/dealers and these are the persons, who , in my opinion, are on maximum risk as by submitting their licenses voluntarily , with their own hands, along with their NICs and admitting the possession of a fire arm of NPB/prohibited bore , they would  expose their selves, though innocently, not knowing about the violation of law they have committed, to the rigors of law, as the negligence of law is no excuse.

Go through a reputable dealer rather than on your own (read: Khawari) or through a friend.\n\n2). Don''t believe when someone tells you that they can get your license made when they are officially closed by the Government of Pakistan. These are either fake or made in ''Backdate'' which although an illegal activity is a bit of a grey area on license originality. Your new MOI license should have a five year expiry from the year you were given it, i.e 2010 license should be expiring in 2015 not 2013/14.\n\n3). Once you get your license go register it in the NBP (National bank of Pakistan) [u]yourself[/u]. Stamps are easy to make like pictured above.\n\nHope it helps friends avoid unnecessary hassles.

I needed advice about two things:\n1- On acquisition of sight picture, I focus squarely at the front sight to take the shot. However at this time (with my spectacle corrected vision) I see two side by side images of the target and have to index on the one on the right. Whats the error here? Talked to Gilani sb about it and he suggested a possible cylindrical sight weakness. I got that checked and thats not the case. Any other bro who faces this problem? btw I''m a right handed shooter with right dominant eye. Another suggestion is closing non-dominant eye, though that feels unnatural\n\n2- Almost all my shots are low. In this as well as first session results. All guns i''ve shot have had the 3 dot sight system. I perceive the target relative to the top edge-line of the aligned sights. Is this correct or should you square the dots on POA?[/quote]\n\nI started shooting with my non dominant eye closed. Over time I have found shooting with both eyes open works better for me. You are right in saying that it feels unnatural closing one eye, I would add that it places additional strain on your dominant eye. Shooting with both eyes open has given me more relaxed shooting and has yielded better results. I use this technique shooting both double and single handed. If I am not mistaken Dr.Inam used to compete with both eyes open method as well. As you may know he is one of Pakistan''s most renowned shooters and did quite admirably at National and International Shooting competitions.\n\nYou may be getting a double image because you are concentrating very fiercely on the front tip. I know that a lot of instructional material advocates this, but using this technique for deliberate fire over a long match means that you tire your eyes very quickly. By all means concentrate on the front tip but remember to keep it within reason.\n\nYou may also be getting a double image because your eye is fluctuating between the sights and your target. Remember that the human eye can only focus on one object at a time.\n\nIn the end you will do better after you have experimented with various techniques and found out what works best for you.

I needed advice about two things:\n1- On acquisition of sight picture, I focus squarely at the front sight to take the shot. However at this time (with my spectacle corrected vision) I see two side by side images of the target and have to index on the one on the right. Whats the error here? Talked to Gilani sb about it and he suggested a possible cylindrical sight weakness. I got that checked and thats not the case. Any other bro who faces this problem? btw I''m a right handed shooter with right dominant eye. Another suggestion is closing non-dominant eye, though that feels unnatural\n\n2- Almost all my shots are low. In this as well as first session results. All guns i''ve shot have had the 3 dot sight system. I perceive the target relative to the top edge-line of the aligned sights. Is this correct or should you square the dots on POA?[/quote]\n\nI started shooting with my non dominant eye closed. Over time I have found shooting with both eyes open works better for me. You are right in saying that it feels unnatural closing one eye, I would add that it places additional strain on your dominant eye. Shooting with both eyes open has given me more relaxed shooting and has yielded better results. I use this technique shooting both double and single handed. If I am not mistaken Dr.Inam used to compete with both eyes open method as well. As you may know he is one of Pakistan''s most renowned shooters and did quite admirably at National and International Shooting competitions.\n\nYou may be getting a double image because you are concentrating very fiercely on the front tip. I know that a lot of instructional material advocates this, but using this technique for deliberate fire over a long match means that you tire your eyes very quickly. By all means concentrate on the front tip but remember to keep it within reason.\n\nYou may also be getting a double image because your eye is fluctuating between the sights and your target. Remember that the human eye can only focus on one object at a time.\n\nIn the end you will do better after you have experimented with various techniques and found out what works best for you. Best of luck![/quote]\n\nDifferent techniques have different advantages. Those techniques, which have proved advantageous for more number of shooters are the one''s generally advocated by the instructors. However, there would always be shooters to whom some other technique may suite more. It therefore does not mean that all instructions other than those given in a text book are wrong and should not be taken. \n\nModern shooting techniques fully recognise the importance of shooter''s body comfort while shooting. A shooter would give his best with a shooting technique which is very natural with his body. Means there is nothing that puts extra strain or discomfort on shooter''s body / mind when he is shooting. Therefore, if a shooter is not comfortable with a particular technique or stance, he should never take it. However, while doing so, it should be ensured that one should not resort to such habits which technically put a shooter in a position of dis-advantage. \n\nAs for shooting with both eyes open or with non-dominant eye closed, there is no binding on that in my view. Many good shooters, specially those who are more into tactical shooting, shoot with both eyes open. It has the advantage of larger field of view which matters a lot during tactical shooting and even real situations. However, many people feel problem in focusing on front site (which is a compulsory requirement) with both eyes open. With non-dominant eye closed, it is easy to focus on an object (front site). That is why we see that in precision shooting (both with handgun and rifle), majority of shooters shoot with non-dominant eye closed. \n\nfearless brother is absolutely right in saying that no extra strain should be put on the eyes while shooting. It would tire the shooter soon and accordingly, the performance would deteriorate after a few shots. For those, who find it difficult to close one eye, there is definitely extra strain on the eyes when they try to do so. One method of avoiding that is by covering the glass lens of non-dominant eye covered with a dark cloth while shooting. This way, one can keep both the eyes open yet he is not using both the eyes hence no problem of focusing.

(126580, 3731, 0, 'Abbas', 1, '', 1279049109, 'Salams All,\n\nA few months ago I test fired an Adkal Ghost TR 02 at the range and it sparked my interest into buying one and testing it out in more detail. Some specs and first impressions. \n\nIt''s a single action, semi automatic chambered in 9mm, weighing about 750 g with a barrel length of 113mm (4.44 Inches) holding 15(+1) rounds. Although this pistol is technically very much a clone of the Glock 17 the frame seems more inspired by Walther P99.  My area of interest for this review is however, is this the ''average man''s Glock'' ? and perhaps an alternate to the highly popular CF98 ?\n\nBefore I go on, I would like to say that there can never be a fair comparison of a product priced at Rs. 250,000 ($3000) and one priced at Rs. 32,000 ($ 400). The higher priced product will always be built of better materials so look at the Adkal with an open mind.\n\nHolding the Ghost for the first time I was surprised that it did not feel cheap and plasticly at all, infact it fit snugly into my hand and felt very solid. Looks wise the gun is beautiful, aesthetically pleasing and the finish is surprisingly good. The Adkal ships with a lighter recoil spring than the Glock, much smoother slide realize and about half a pound lighter trigger pull at perhaps 4.75lb than the Glock''s 5.5 lb. Dry firing a few times the trigger pull of the Adkal is almost unpredictable compared to the Glock''s relatively deep, precise and  crisp trigger. With the Glock you know exactly at what stage of the trigger pull the gun will go off, with the Adkal every shot is a surprise. At first I thought it was a bad thing but then I realized the surprise element helps getting rid of any flinching if the trigger is being squeezed. \n\nThe loaded chamber indicator is excellently placed at the rear of the slide. A large red dot reminds one that the striker is cocked and ready for action. [u]The pistol comes with three interchangeable back straps to suit different hands and comfort levels. [/u] The polymer frame with the rubber backstraps make for a really comfortable grip. \n\nAnother interesting thing is when I first saw the Ghost it made me think it''s the size of the Glock 19 but when I put it next to my 17 it turned out to be slightly larger than even it ! The shape and ergonomics are excellent, even though it is a large frame pistol it doesn''t look it and is very handy. \n\nSince almost every internal detail resembled the Glock, in the interest of science (and stupidity) I tried to see if the barrels were interchangeable. They are not. Two wasted hours of my life, half a bottle of Hoppes lubricating oil and a rubber mallet were needed to fix things. \n\nGlock magazines also do not fit the Ghost as they are sized somewhere in between the 17''s and the 19''s mags.\n\nThere have been quite a few queries as to the differences between the TR-02, TR-03 and TR-04. Quite simply there are none except minor aesthetics. The only difference between the TR-03 and the TR-02 is the texture of the grip. The 03 has a flat and grainy grip texture like the Glock17. The 04 has a 02 like grip but the slide has finger grooves in the back only (to pull back the slide) not the barrel end as well like the 02 and 03.\n\nDisassembling the Ghost is easy and very Glock like, the barrel and spring look to be of decent quality and the internal finish of the slide is fair to good. It seems failing to replicate the Tenifer coating process of the Glock barrel Adkal tried to add durability by making it thicker and heavier. This is perhaps why it weights 100 or so g''s more than the 17.\n\nThe pistol comes with a firing pin safety and a safe action trigger like the Glock. It seems to work well, I tried to pull the trigger back but it did not budge without the center trigger depressed. \n\nI am looking forward to testing it at the range coming weekend and only after firing a few hundred rounds though it will be able to comment on it''s reliability and accuracy. For the moment, without firing it, I''m quite impressed considering what I spent.\n\nBelow are detailed pictures of the Ghost and compared to a Glock 17. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/3_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/4_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/5_resize.jpg[/img]\n \n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/6_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/7_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/8_resize.jpg[/img]\n\nA closer look at the slide finish.

How you relate to your dog is solely upon your own bond with the animal. Brother EasyRider would agree with me, every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself. i have kept pedigreed & non-pedigreed GSDs, rotts, dobermen, a mastiff and i have kept and raised stray dogs also.

To be honest Easyriders comment was not to put you down, it was only in the best interest of the animal. So dont take comments from people so hard on yourself. I have gotten into fist fights with people over stonning of stray dogs. And one more thing, after having been around dogs since i was 3 years old, one thing error of yours i can point out with all my authority, NEVER PUT YOUR DOG ON A LEASH WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING HIM. Dogs belong to the family of wolves, they like to move around when they are eating. So give him his bowl and let him off the leash.\n\n@EasyRider, brother i like the way you handle you pet.

Allah Taala the Creator of this Universe - having created the dog would surely have known that the dog requires Human affection and love to exist in this world.This does not mean that you hate dogs, Yes there are some boundaries defined like not to touch a dog when he is wet, his saliva is impure, do not mouth them like people do in western countries, as Fahad bro said, just go and get a dog :) Pedigree doesn''t matter, pedigree is just a certificate that how pure a dog is, and believe me you dont need that :) and as fahad said [b]every dog, will give you a totally different vibe, its an addicition in itself.[/b] if you keep any dog believe me its gonna change the way you live your life, So keep a dog, your routine will automatically be changed, There''ll be a time when you get busy in your life, you will have no time for your hobbies, If not now, then never :)[/quote]\n\nwhat do you mean by don''t touch the dog when HE is wet.  :D[/quote]\nAh well i dont want to put religious talk again :) Anyways bro i''v heard from elders that Touching a dog is not haram, but if you/your clothes get wet by touching a dog then you''ve to clean your clothes otherwise you can''t offer prayer. This is all I wanted to say.  Maybe its wrong but I confirmed it from a mufti sb.', 0, 1, '116.71.182.3', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1271, 144380),

It has the advantage of larger field of view which matters a lot during tactical shooting and even real situations. However, many people feel problem in focusing on front site (which is a compulsory requirement) with both eyes open. With non-dominant eye closed, it is easy to focus on an object (front site). That is why we see that in precision shooting (both with handgun and rifle), majority of shooters shoot with non-dominant eye closed. \n\n[/quote]\nExcellent discussion. Lots of very valid points raised. The one thing that is clear is that the best option for me or any beginning shooter will only be determined on the range, given some time. Both methods should be given a serious shot (pun intended) for enough time to distinguish the clearly better method for oneself.\n\nRegarding the double image problem, I see on the web that that is a common occurance and is because of keeping both eyes open. Heres my analysis: Keeping both eyes open in itself doesn''t create the problem and you can train to not see the double image. In my case, and as bro Fearless sb was 100% correctly speculating, When focussing on the front sight, I was training both eyes on it completely (as if looking squarely at it). This isn''t correct and leads to the simple constraint of the human visual system whereby the eyes can only focus on one point and anything fore or aft is prone to deteriorated visual perception. In my case the two images start to move away from each other as both eyes come to focus on the front sight. They are farthest apart, and way too much btw, when both eyes rest on the front sight.\n\nInstead of explaining more verbally, I''ve created some illustrations to show this point. I so far couldn''t find such illustrations from proper scientific resources, so had to create my own, hence.. [b]Disclaimer:[/b] I''m sure this is only part of the picture and the actual physics may not be accurate. Those with better knowledge should plz augment.\n\n[b]With one (dominant) eye open[/b], there is perception of only one image. In most cases this is the ideal situation for targetting, if not for sustaining it long enough etc as previously discussed in detail by Gilani sahab\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Double%20Image%20Illustration/01-DoubleImageIllustration.jpg[/img]\n[b]\nWith the non-dominant eye also open[/b] and focussed on the front sight, because of the axial displacement from the dominant eye, it percieves its own image of the target. It is the less dominant image as well, you see it less clearly, more opaque\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Double%20Image%20Illustration/02-DoubleImageIllustration.jpg[/img]\n\nThis error simply magnifies the greater the distance to the target, as illustrated below. That is why i didn''t notice this while dry practicing because of never more than 8-10 M distance there\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Double%20Image%20Illustration/03-DoubleImageIllustration.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '58.65.167.98', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1774, 144437),

Now... I am not so sure.\n\nThe barrel-cocking action was slightly stiffer than that on the Shadow 1000, probably because the latter has seen more use. The wooden stock, as I said earlier, being heavier, reduces the felt recoil, but the rifle consistently slipped while shooting, probably due to the smooth wood finish (I use a wooden stool, with a book as a rest). The trigger felt different, almost unpredictable, and a little heavy, unlike the two-stage trigger of the Shadow 1000. I did not change the windage/elevation of the rear sights, since they were set by Abba. However, the Shadow''s sights are much more user friendly, due their markings, and the positive clicks during adjustment. \n\nThe Match pellets I used fit in more snugly in the breech of the Hunter 440 compared to the Shadow 1000. Power-wise, both appear to seem the same (judging on the impact sound on a particular target - no differences in penetration were noticed). The sight picture, is more or less, the same.\n\nIf one tends to carry around his rifle a lot, the Shadow 1000 gets a big thumbs up... for someone used to the Shadow, the heft of the Hunter 440 can tire them out.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] If one is looking for aesthetics and favors wooden furniture, the Hunter 440 is a good choice. However, a wooden stock and a (flimsy)micrometric sight does not justify the massive price difference between the Hunter and the Shadow (35K vs 22K).\n\nI think I''ll stick to the Shadows...\n\nGentlemen, comments are valued... as always...', 0, 1, '110.37.27.146', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1968, 144539),

Now... I am not so sure.\n\nThe barrel-cocking action was slightly stiffer than that on the Shadow 1000, probably because the latter has seen more use. The wooden stock, as I said earlier, being heavier, reduces the felt recoil, but the rifle consistently slipped while shooting, probably due to the smooth wood finish (I use a wooden stool, with a book as a rest). The trigger felt different, almost unpredictable, and a little heavy, unlike the two-stage trigger of the Shadow 1000. I did not change the windage/elevation of the rear sights, since they were set by Abba. However, the Shadow''s sights are much more user friendly, due their markings, and the positive clicks during adjustment. \n\nThe Match pellets I used fit in more snugly in the breech of the Hunter 440 compared to the Shadow 1000. Power-wise, both appear to seem the same (judging on the impact sound on a particular target - no differences in penetration were noticed). The sight picture, is more or less, the same.\n\nIf one tends to carry around his rifle a lot, the Shadow 1000 gets a big thumbs up... for someone used to the Shadow, the heft of the Hunter 440 can tire them out.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] If one is looking for aesthetics and favors wooden furniture, the Hunter 440 is a good choice. However, a wooden stock and a (flimsy)micrometric sight does not justify the massive price difference between the Hunter and the Shadow (35K vs 22K).\n\nI think I''ll stick to the Shadows...\n\nGentlemen, comments are valued... as always...[/quote]\n\n\nthis is exactly what i expected\n\na really really wanted review for my self\n\nthe only gun im planning next is the WHISPER\nits all the same as the SHADOW but there is a silencer to it\nand out of pakistan, there isnt much difference between the two\n\nplus it looks much more agressive\n\nwhat do u say ?', 0, 1, '58.65.131.178', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1968, 144590),

It was crafted for both poor concealment and for poor access. \n\nThe holster was low end, though a popular brand.  It was a Fobus paddle holster. It was not worn well and I noted the lack of a belt on one test subject.\n\nThe students were trained without the protective gloves and then forced to engage the killer wearing the gloves- this created a unrealistic handicap.\n\n20/20 wasn''t interested in the truth as to whether a student with a gun could have made a difference.

(7,000 series stampings are more in line whereas almost all 8,000 series had "9mm PARA" stamping out of wack.\n\nKindly consult Gilani Sb. he was demonstrated in detail regarding the differences while we were at PARA, LHR.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\nWe inspected one gun of 7000 series and quite a few from 8000 series. The dococker of 7000 series CZ worked better than those of 8000 series (as mentioned, it worked in 2 stages while that of 8000 series was a single stage decocking function). However, I have extensively used the decocker of 8000 series and never found any problem with it. \n\nThe difference in markings was also there, and as mentioned by 12guage, those of 7000 series were better looking. However, in my view it does not make any difference in the functioning of the gun. As regards the functioning of the weapons, I can''t say for sure because I have never fired a 7000 series CZ though I have fired quite a few from 8000 series. The shooting performance of 8000 series CZ is very good, perhaps the best of all the guns that are available in <100k range. If 7000 series shoots better than 8000 series CZ than this is a significant difference. :)\n\nBTW, this thread was started because of a stainless steel guide rod in brother Starfish''s CZ which is normally not found in other CZs.

Before you commit funds to buying a Gamo Delta/Shadow 640/Shadow 1000, try and see if your Diana 35 can be cleaned, serviced and made ready for use. If there is no rust or major wear on the internal parts, I don''t see why it won''t give you another decade of service, provided it is maintained and well-cared for.

This is by far the most unreliable pistol I have ever fired or seen or heard off. In the 75 or so odd rounds I fired, truthfully without any exaggeration every single round failed to load/eject. In just one instance with Wolf ammo I fired a consecutive 5 shots and after that could not fire even two together (tried both mags). I thought worst case scenario all 7 kinds of ammo were bad and proceeded to fire only Wolf. It turned out the 5 shots were a fluke, every Wolf round FTE''d thereafter. \n\nPoint wise:\n\n1). The trigger is very tricky and for any target shooter junk. \n2). The slide release kept scraping my thumb after every shot.\n3). The GUN refused to cycle any rounds at all. Perhaps Akdal were paying homage to the concept of the single shot Musket.\n4). The gun fired even in single shot mode has average accuracy at best. \n\nIf I was forced to say anything good about it, in the 75 rounds fired the Striker performed fine. There were no FTF''s only FTE''s. \n\nFirst thing Monday I will take it back to the dealer and return it. I don''t mind if a product is bad or doesn''t suit my hand but the Akdal simply doesn''t work. Am also seriously considering writing to Akdal and asking for a refund of my ammo wasted on testing their useless product. \n\nVerdict: If any of you missed the subtle hints against the Ghost above.

One of the ranger personnel approached me while I was in the car and the following exchange took place:\n\nQ) Coming from?\nA) Home - told him the address\n\nQ) Going to?\nA) Shooting Range - told him which one\n\nQ) Want to search the car\nA) By all means - and telling him before hand that there are licensed weapons and ammo in the car''s trunk.\n\nAll guns and ammo were taken out of the trunk and taken to the ranger mobile parked nearby. I was asked for my licenses and carrying permits if I have any. I gave them my licenses and informed them that although I have permits but they stand canceled and are of no use.\n\nAll guns and magazines were empty and in hard cases. Ammo was kept separately. Guns and ammo were in the boot (i.e., locked condition).\n\nLicenses were checked. Details of it were matched with my CNIC. Serial numbers of each weapon were matched with the license. Renewal was checked. Ammo was counted and noted along with all other details about me and the guns & ammo on a piece of paper by an SI rank ranger person, who happened to be the senior most among them available there. \n\nHe then made a call to his superior, a Colonel rank officer in the 31st wing situated at Toll Plaza, Karachi and told him all my and guns&ammo details along with the fact that all documents are in order and that I was proceeding from my home to a shooting range and that all guns were empty and in locked condition. His superior asked him to wait. After about 25 mins from that phone call, the Colonel called the SI and asked him to let me proceed to my destination. He apparently cross-checked my details some database they might be having\n\nI was handed over my stuff and requested to check everything and make sure that nothing was missing. Two ranger personnel helped me pack everything back in my bag. We shook hands and I proceeded to the range.\n\nNo references were used. I played cool during the whole while and cooperated with them. I helped them match the details of CNIC with license and of license with gun/ammo. I also informed them voluntarily the ammo quantity I was carrying and the ammo limits on my licenses, which was enough to cover the quantity I was carrying.\n\nOverall, I had to wait for an hour before I was asked to go (30 mins to match the details plus around another 30 mins awaiting further orders from HQs). \n\nDuring my discussion with the ranger''s SI rank officer, I asked him what if I had my .45 in the front with me instead of locked in booth, with mags full, what then? He replied that it would not have made any difference and the procedure and end result would have been the same.\n\nTherefore, it is my firm conclusion, that if you have all your documents in order and are on the right side of law, this Section 144 does not effect you (being an honest tax paying genuine citizen) to keep a weapon in your car, even if it is loaded. \n\nHope this helps.', 0, 1, '110.37.54.123', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 73, 145146),

In the hands of a good shooter it can shoot less than 2 inch groups at 15 M and 2.5-3 inch groups at 25 M. I am confident and today after shooting it Gilani sahib agrees that this pistol is quite capable of 180/200 at 25 M''s. That''s fantastic for a 40 K pistol.\n\n@Topak Yes it is a better pistol than the Kanuni but the Kanuni itself is a great piece and decently accurate. I''m not very updated on your shooting skills but would suggest that first you bring up your shooting to the level where you are consistently hitting at least 150 out of 200 at 15 M''s which the Kanuni is very much capable of doing.

You are right about a lot of things, but at the same time, I''ve experienced that there''s a difference of opinion (interpretation) as well as ambiguities among even high ranking police officers.\n\nFor example, like I mentioned above, the rangers personnel asked me for carry permit. Although I had the permits with me, I informed him that all such permits stand cancelled and are of no use. In reply he gave me a blank (clueless) look.\n\n[quote=MianTaimur]When there is a restriction to carry a weapon, one cannot carry a weapon unless he has got a carry permit issued from Home Department, period !!! [/quote]\n\n\n[quote=MianTaimur]Strapping a weapon to yourself is prohibited, when 144 is imposed. Wherelse carrying your weapon in your movable property is a loop hole. [/quote]\n\nAgreed. There is a loop hole / ambiguity in this regard. Especially in case of transporting for example from dealership to home or for repair purposes or for range visits. The law does not cover these aspects and is open to interpretation. Even there are judgements favoring both sides.\n\n\n\n[quote=MianTaimur]Some people interprate it as allowed and permitted (But you would still need a carry permit for that) and the verdict which I got now is, that the police [b]tries to [/b]control the transportation of weapons, even in vehicles when there is a state of emergency i.e 144. [b]Hence carrying weapons should be avoided always when 144 is imposed.\n[/b][/quote]\n\nAgreed with the addition ''unless extremely necessary'' and that too not on your person, but in your car. (Carry permits are irrelevant as all stand cancelled in Sindh).\n\n\n[quote=MianTaimur]\nFurther on the letter referred above is issued by the Home Department, Government of Punjab, which is a provincial concern, But the question is weather it is implemented in Sind or not. As we know license issuing policies in both the province slightly differ, similarly the scenario for Sind regarding 144 in contest to the above letter has to be confirmed.[/quote]\n\nAgreed.\n\n \nMy take on this 144 application on carrying weapons is that, one should not carry weapon unless absolutely necessary to protect his and/or his dear ones lives. If one is not exposed to such risk, s/he should avoid carrying. Moreover, even if one does ''have'' to carry, s/he should do so preferably in the car and not on his/her person. Only in case of extreme necessity, should one carry on his/her person and we know that there are only rare occasions when one has to do that. The advice I''ve received from law enforcement personnel whom I know and have met, criminal lawyers (one of them being one of the top ones), an ex-attorney general from mushy''s tenure (close relative of mine) and a couple of Judicial Magistrates (who cover mostly criminal cases) is the same as mentioned above in this para with the addition that the benefit always goes to the genuine citizen who can prove and justify that it was necessary for him to carry his weapon, Sec 144 or no Sec 144.\n\nHowever, I agree with you 100% that the factor of ''hassle'' is there and unavoidable, which is why, I''d repeat my suggestion that carry if and only if it is absolutely necessary during imposition of section 144.', 0, 1, '116.71.30.60', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 73, 145954),

The clarity of the water comes from the multiple glaciers all around the high basin which feed the lake.

One could  only carry a weapon in his moveable property if he has aquired a carry permit. This is my understanding of the law after talking to friends in related field. The sad part is we tend to keep a blind eye on this and satisfy ourselves that we have a licsense etc, When I enquired about this the simple and straight anwer which I got was "NO" when 144 is imposed you simply cannot carry your weapon (even in your car), unless you have a carry permit\n\n[quote=Yoosha] "yar ye Pakistan hai, sab chalta hai....kuch nahee hota, ghoom tay raho le ker"....\n\nSo, even if you scratch out the last sentence, it seems OK.

God forbid is some one has to use the weapon and he doesnt have a carry permit, he could be implemented aswel, just like if some one has a car accident and he doesnt have a driving license.

It''s commonly known that the mother of all pistols is the great [b]1911 model [/b], the design itself is over a 100 years old but time hasn''t stopped its popularity. It''s considered one of the most accurate pistols ever made and has proven to be popular with pro target shooters and law enforcement, including SWAT. \n\nNow, I seem to research a lot before buying a firearm and trust me when I say that I have been obsessing over 1911s for a while, throughout my research I came across a manufacturer called KIMBER America, it came up to the ranks of ParaOrdnance, Colt, Smiths and Springfield, KIMBER even surpasses them from what I''ve read online.\n\nComing to my point, we live in a country where standard pistols like glocks and berettas are triple they''re worth here than what they are in the US, most of the people I bump into don''t have a clue about 1911s and think that a glock 19 is the hight of a firearm, so finding a KIMBER 1911 (which start from around $1000) would be almost impossible to find let alone buy. \n\nI recently came across a TAURUS 1911 .45 acp, which was going around 100,000 Rs (not bad to be honest) but I really don''t want to buy it just to sustain my crave for a good 1911, my purpose of joining PAKGUNS was to see if there were any more 1911 lover''s out there and if so, where I could get a hold of some good 1911 pistols apart from a TAURUS.\n\n[img]http://www.kimberamerica.com/images/wallpaper/pistols/800x600/royal_II.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.kimberamerica.com/images/wallpaper/pistols/800x600/eclipse_target_II_2.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '115.186.116.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5322, 146159),

Stayed at Youth Hostels all the way to Kaghan valley. \n	Balakot was very small town, few shops about ten and 3-4 small permitive restaurants. The paved small road ended at Balakot . The town had historical value ie. The battle between [i]Shah Ismail Shaheed[/i] and the Sikhs.[i]Shah Ismail[/i] was killed and buried there on the roadside over the creek. There was no moslume over [i]Shah Ismail''s[/i] grave, but one tree over shadowed his burial site and local used to tie small strips of cloth. I saw that ritual all over the graves. I do n’t know what it meant? \n	From Balakot to Naran it was dirt, primitive dangerous road, or I might say a “ Mule Trail”.  Now, its major strategic HI Way. Naran hardly had any population. But, now, North East Pakistan has rapidly changed. What I wanted to see was “K2” but never did. Inshallah, this time, I will visit “K2”.

Congratulations Abbas, MashAllah, you''re doing a great job!\n\nLets get down to business shall we? \nI consider myself a great lover of pistols and pride myself on knowing a lot about them. It''s commonly known that the mother of all pistols is the great [b]1911 model [/b], the design itself is over a 100 years old but time hasn''t stopped its popularity. It''s considered one of the most accurate pistols ever made and has proven to be popular with pro target shooters and law enforcement, including SWAT. \n\nNow, I seem to research a lot before buying a firearm and trust me when I say that I have been obsessing over 1911s for a while, throughout my research I came across a manufacturer called KIMBER America, it came up to the ranks of ParaOrdnance, Colt, Smiths and Springfield, KIMBER even surpasses them from what I''ve read online.\n\nComing to my point, we live in a country where standard pistols like glocks and berettas are triple they''re worth here than what they are in the US, most of the people I bump into don''t have a clue about 1911s and think that a glock 19 is the hight of a firearm, so finding a KIMBER 1911 (which start from around $1000) would be almost impossible to find let alone buy. \n\nI recently came across a TAURUS 1911 .45 acp, which was going around 100,000 Rs (not bad to be honest) but I really don''t want to buy it just to sustain my crave for a good 1911, my purpose of joining PAKGUNS was to see if there were any more 1911 lover''s out there and if so, where I could get a hold of some good 1911 pistols apart from a TAURUS.\n[/quote]\n\nWelcome to PakGuns, Miza/romerate!\n\nI own two Kimber 1911 pistols.  One is the base line 1911 (a Custom II), the other is their top of the line 1911 (the Supermtach II).  I greatly enjoy them.  Kimber makes a great product.  Springfield also makes a great product.  I almost bought a Springfield TGO.  I have no doubt that had I bought a TGO I''d be writing about how wonderful it is.\n\nThere are other 1911s which sometimes get overlooked.  First is STI, and also Smith & Wesson.  The Smith and Wesson SW1911 is getting good reviews.  STI makes a better 1911 than Colt, Para, Kimber, Springfield or S&W. \n\nS&W, Colt, Para, Springfield, Kimber all are mass manufacturers.  They produce a lot of guns of each model.  As such they are not fully customized.  Each gets only a certain amount of detailed attention from a gun smith.  STI spends a little more attention per gun.  Many STI guns cost as much as my Kimber Supermatch II.  The Supermatch gets the most attention at Kimber from a gun smith and costs about $1800 - $2000, US.  Many STI''s are $1500 and up over $2000, US.\n\nThen there are almost fully customized guns like Les Baer, Wilson Combat.  These get a lot of attention from a smith and the cost reflects it.  Most of them cost well over $2000, and some are over $3000, US.\n\nThe Taurus available to you is not gun crafted like these models. But, a local gun smith and do much to make the PT1911 a much better gun.  Simply polishing certain parts of the trigger mechanism would do wonders for your ability to shoot the gun accurately.  Hardcroming the slide and polishing the slid and frame fit helps too.  I am not a gun smith so I do not wish to suggest too much with too much accuracy because I am only repeating what I have heard from others.\n\nIf the Pt1911 is all you can get your hands on, get it and enjoy it. \n\nBest regards,\n\nSteve :cool:', 0, 1, '70.243.65.121', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5322, 146288),

The only porblem is that, its not available as widely as Taurus is. I am also a 1911 fan and i would love to own a Colt 1911 XSE but that does not seem to be possible right now. I bought Taurus 1911 with Rails instead and after shooting a Colt 1911 A1 and Taurus, i can easily say that Taurus wins hands down. Reason being, Colt one was very old piece. Its very difficult for us to do a comparision with other brands due to non availability of products. Your price of 100K for Taurus is a bit steep. I bought mine for 75K thanks to Moeen Bhai and then had to pull lots of strings to get 3 different sets of Grips for it from America. Currently i am waiting for Ed from Wicked Grips to make my Dragon Grip that i ordered. As you can see from the pictures below, Grip on a 1911 totally changes its appearance. My suggestion to you would be to go for the Taurus 1911 currently and then go for another brand later on with availability.\nOn a side note though, on my last shopping spree to Lahore, i talked to Ahsan about import of Colt 1911 and he said that he would import them only if there were 5 people to buy them at the spot. So if you are game enough, i take responsibility of 2 Pieces :)\nEnjoy the pictures.\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009079.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009080.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009084.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009085.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009087.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/23122009088.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/24122009089.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/24122009090.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af85/AdeelAhmad/24122009092.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '119.152.132.62', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5322, 146453),

Bear in mind that he''s talking about a "Rental" handgun.[/b]\n\n[quote]The other issue I do not like with those pistols are the movement of the ejector / sear housing and the manual safety lever. The parts I mentioned may have a little play on all kind of CZs and its clones, but it is more noticeable in the Canik pistols. I does not effect the function of the pistol, but again it may be a consideration for the shooters and enthusiats who pay so much close attention to the details.\n\nOther then that, they are pretty reliable and durable pistols, especially the all steel standard versions. In Turkey unfortunately only high pressure 124 gr NATO FMJ is available for civilians in 9x19 mm , and the pistols you see above are eating a thousand round of high pressure NATO ammo almost in every week. I have seen a standard all steel Canik 55 still going strong after 40.000 rounds of NATO ammo while a rental Beretta 92 lost its barrel at approximately 25.000 rounds of that ammo. But unfortunately the aluminum alloy frames of the Canik pistols do not exceed 30.000 rounds life with that ammo. Again this round counts are shot at most in a year.\n\nBest.

(often called the .45 "GAP") pistol cartridge was designed by Ernest Durham, an engineer with CCI/Speer, at the request of firearms manufacturer Glock to provide a cartridge that would equal the power of the .45 ACP but was shorter to fit in a more compact handgun, and with a stronger case head to reduce the possibility of case neck blowouts. G.A.P. is an acronym for "Glock Automatic Pistol", and the .45 G.A.P. is the first commercially-introduced cartridge identified with Glock.\nThe .45 GAP is the same diameter as the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, but is shorter than the .45 ACP and uses a small-pistol primer, instead of the large-pistol primer as found in most commercial loadings of the .45 ACP. Originally, the maximum weight of the .45 GAP was 200-grain (13 g), and in order to provide terminal ballistics on par with the standard 230-grain (15 g) .45 ACP "factory loads" the .45 GAP was designed to operate at a higher standard pressure—roughly equivalent to the higher pressure found in the .45 ACP "+P" rounds. The designer was only able to achieve the desired pressure and resulting velocity through powder selection since the .45 GAP has a much smaller cartridge volume than the .45 ACP. Later development concluded that the .45 GAP could in fact fire 230-grain (15 g) ammunition just as the .45 ACP.\n\nNow according to the above information it seems that both are not interchangeable.', 0, 1, '119.152.33.122', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5343, 146884),

There were 4 FTFs in 5 bullets and the accuracy was miserable too. Had no desire to fire anymore from this junk. \n\nThough the range reports of Akdal Ghost had never been positive, however, there have been comments from few members who greatly appreciated the performance, beauty and accuracy of this gun. Some of them even insisted about it''s high accuracy from 50 and 75 meters :mad: :mad: [b]I always requested them to post some range results but none were ever posted.[/b] However, the praise for Akdal continued after every short while and this triggered great interest amongst some of the new members to buy this handgun as it greatly resembled a Glock and was very cheap as well. Hope they have enough evidence now about the performance of this gun :) \n\nThe review from Abbas sahib is an eye opener which proves one focal aspect; [b]when buying a handgun, dont go for the style and finish. See the performance of the gun.[/b] If it performs reliably and accurately, its a good gun, even if the finish is not very impressive. And if the gun is not reliable and accurate, its a peice of junk, no matter how beautiful and impressive it looks. \n\nI tested a TR2 on 3rd of April this year and wrote this short review..........................  \n\n[quote=Gilani]Hi guys!  Here is Akdal Ghost TR2. A friend of mine used to talk very high of his Akdal Ghost. Today, I borrowed his pistol and carried out the test. It was an almost new pistol with only 50 rounds fired from it.  And what a disappointment. Though I have fired a lot from Akdal Ghost TR1 and was never impressed with it, this one was even worst. When my friend called me in the evening and asked about the performance of his pistol, I simply told him to change the handgun if he can and never to carry it for SD. May be this one was a lemon but I would rate a well made local clone better than this pistol. Here we go..................\n\nFirer: 		Gilani\nHandgun:	Akdal Ghost TR2\nCondition:	Excellent. 100%\nBarrel:		113 MM\nSize:		190x135x30 mm (a very convenient size BTW)\nDist:		10, 20 & 30 M\nAmmo:		POF 2Z\nSequence:	5 shots from 10 M, 5 from 20M and 5 from 30M on the same target.\nStoppages:	3 out of 30, one misfire and two failures to feed. \nScore:		73 / 300 [b](24.33 %)[/b]\n[b]Accuracy Rating:	JUNK, DONT BUY IT[/b]\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5930.jpg[/img]\nYou can see that bullets from 10 M (encircled in red) are on the right side of bull but far away from the centre. Only two bullets hitting from 20 M. And from 30 M, not even a single hit on the target. I just could not imagine that such a nice looking handgun could be so inaccurate also. :mad:\n\n[img]http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb136/sualeh/Guns/DSCN5939.jpg[/img]\nSecond test fire was worst than first. All bullets from 10 M hitting right and low. No bullet from 20 M and only 1 bullet from 30 M. This one bullet from 30 M must have been my fault because all other bullets were hitting way outside the target. So far away that my attendant was continuously saying, Sir where are you shooting :)\n\nAkdal Ghost TR2 is a nice looking pistol with a very good grip and balance. Has a very convenient size and to say the least, is impressive out of box. Barrel is very light. In comparison, CZ999 has a slightly shorter barrel but is far more heavy. I am not sure what material the barrel of TR2 is made of but its certainly a very light one. \n\n[b]Ranger performance of Ghost TR2, as you have seen above, is [/b] [b]miserable[/b]. The gun i tested was hitting way off the target and trigger is quite pathetic. There were three stoppages which does not speak good on the reliability part. It is possible that the one that I tested was a lemon and other Akdal pistols are good but I am not very positive about it. I have fired more than 100 rounds from Akdal Ghost TR1 also and that handgun was also not reliable though it was more accurate than this one, but still not very accurate. If this be the standard of average Akdal pistol, I would not recommend any to buy Ghost TR2.

In this price range, it would be extremely difficult to find a more accurate gun.

Poison it (Chemo Therapy) that only work for testicular, Lymphatic and childhood leukemia.\n	These are out dated treatments and works only in few cases about 16 % but it has its price.

So this does not necessarily has to be a good handgun from performance point of view, however, it must have some historical significance like being very old, having remained the sidearm of many armies, having beein used in some extraordinay historical event or having survived in the market for a long time etc etc. \n\nIf we consider the above, only Walther PPK and Makarov deserve to stay in the list. Sig P226, CZ75 and Beretta 92fs, though amonst the best ever pistols, are relatively newer models and do not have a historical significance per se. Cougar has never been included amongst the world best and is hardly historical. Smith & Wesson, well yes, but which model of S&W? Unless we specify the model, it would not be possible to comment. \n\nMany of the historical handguns fulfilling the above crieteria are revolvers. So any list of historical handguns would not be complete without Colt SA Army revolvers, Nagant revolvers, Webley and Scott revolvers etc. \n\nHowever, if we are talking about the pistols only, than in my view, as already pointed out by many members, Colt 1911 (not the newly manufactured 1911 clones), Browning HiPower, TT33, Luger and few others need to be included in the list. \n\nOut of the above, Browning Hipower has the honour of being the official sidearm of more than 20 armies of the world for around half a century, followed by Makarov and TT-33. Walther PP/ PPK has been one of the most popular CC handgun for 60-70 years and has been used by many celeberaties. Colt 1911, conversely, has been used mostly by US Army only, however, due to media dominance of US, has been able to get maximum publicity. It surely has the honour of being the most widely manufactured handgun in the world.  \n\nI would personally rate Browning HiPower, Walther PPK, Makarov and Colt 1911 amonst the handguns which will always have a significant place in the history of pistols. :)', 0, 1, '203.128.255.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5323, 147192),

Shooting ranges are no doubt scarce and expensive. But as per my personal information, many of us have spent far more money on buying the weapons whereas they could have easily acquired the membership of a shooting club (alongwith buying good quantity of ammo to fire) in the price of say one over 200k pistol. So in my view, its not just the non-availability or high membership fee of ranges. Our priority, in many cases, is different. We are more inclined towards buying / collecting more and more weapons and relatively less inclined towards shooting those guns on a proper firing range. :) \n\nBut now I see a lot of members showing the desire of shooting on a proper firing range. When there is a will, there is a way. I am sure people would find out the way and when this happens more frequently, many of the so called handgun giants that enjoyed a very high reputation for years will be exposed and many of the so called [b]cheap[/b] guns would come up. With more use, people would start understanding that which handgun gives more value for money. Once that knowledge would be shared on forums like PakGuns, those who do not get the opportunity to go on shooting ranges will have better idea about the real worth of a handgun, ie, which gun has high quality finish but low performance and which handgun has high quality finish with good performance but has a very high price tag too and therefore, does not provide good value for money etc etc. \n\nJust my humble opinion on the issue :)', 0, 1, '203.128.255.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5257, 147197),

We reached quiet late cause honestly it was a last moment kinda urge. anyways, It was late and every thing was done in a hurry (but properly) as the light was fading.\n\nanyways here are the main results of the test: (point wise)\n\n1. weight: a little on the heavy side but not at all uncomfortable, the gun was pretty quick to mount.\n\n2. balance: right in the middle. neutral balance. good i guess cause its mostly personal preference.\n\n3. trigger: very nice. crisp, no creep, no pre-travel. good trigger.\n\n4. LOP: perfect for rotor but a little short for me. even on the patterning board I was shooting it high.\n\n5. patterns: since the time was short so pattern testing was sorta conducted in "guestimation" mode. in my humble opinion. the patters are pretty good. nice. uniformly distributed. but a little on the tighter side. I guess, since the gun has fixed choke, the manufacturer intentionally opted to make it "modified" to cater to wide variety of hunting scenarios. modified is usually taken as "jack of all" type of choke. overall, good patterns.\n\n6. cycling: boy! the gun cycled fast. faster than most shotguns. no way of accurately measuring it but from "what I felt" standpoint, there was significant difference in cycling speed. it my opinion, its one of the most desired and highly sought after semi auto shotgun traits.\n\n7. reliability: hmmm....... absolutely flawless. some 50 rounds fired just to test the reliability of the gun with mixed loads (light/hunting and heavy/target loads). not even a single failure to feed or fire. the bolt successfully locked back each time the mag ran empty. to be honest, since the gun is desi made, I was expecting some issues but the gun practically ran and consumed everything like a high-end shotgun (a typical stereotype statement) would. in simple words, one could not ask for more.\n\n8. ejection: awesome ejection, 10 to 12 feet minimum with every kind of load.\n\n9. recoil: very mild. mostly because of the heavy weight and semi auto configuration. rotor was comfortably emptying magazine tube full of hard kicking hunting rounds in mere seconds. I could see the BOOMSHAKALAKA! grin on his face afterwards every time he did the "end of the world" drill. It was like Rotor against a hoard of charging zombies.\n\n10. performance: I missed skeet''s first shot. adjusted the aiming technique cause the gun was obviously a little short for my size and then it was like [b]WE WILL, WE WILL, ROCK YOU![/b] (in stereo sound and with two 12-inch dual-coil subs). nothing like consecutive clay busting to bring a happy grin to your face.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nI am definitely getting this gun. it will serve as a good beater gun as well as a good guest gun. way better then the POS semi auto offering of DSA. It makes semi auto DSA look like a cheap toy.

Select a fairly distant object. Should preferably be elongated in shape.  \n2.  Raise your index finger and cover the object behind you index finger while focusing on index finger with both eyes open. Dont move your index finger. \n3.  Now [b]close the left eye[/b] and see that object moves or stays covered behind your index finger. [b]If it does not move[/b] and remains covered behind your index finger as it was seen with both eyes open, [b]than your right eye is your master eye[/b]. If it moves, this is not your master eye.  \n4.  Repeat the same procedure with right eye closed. It should confirm the observation given with left eye. ie, If the object moves and does not remain covered behind index finger, than it is confirmed that your master eye is right eye and vice versa. \n\nPlease try this and than we can discuss it further.

It has to be done by you alone, though other person can guide you or supervise you while you are going through these steps. \n\nregards[/quote]\n\nGilani Sb, I have tried the above several times since our last meet, alone as well in company of others, and have come to conclusion (with confirmation from other PG members) that I am also left eye dominant!

I am not chellenging good translation by hunting master but as far as game experience is concerned, i believe in just 3 calls which one must learn and the easiest onez.\n\n1 Simple quacking of 5 to 7 series (Try it when u see them at a distance say 150-200 yard). to get their attention.\n\n2. as soon u find them comming in Stop calling, untill and unless u feel an errecting wings (mean they r changing their trajectory). here add some feeding chatter and then again simple quack for 3 to 5 quacks (Slow in sound than before) n wait. Remember distance is key, if they are in 100 yards and comming in STOP everything n wait. \n\nIf they are maintaining height add some feeding chatter or simple quack of 2 to 3 nodes only. \n\nMix both calls according to situation, but never blow when things are in favor.\n\n3rd one is most important i.e. Comeback call ........... Its really a majic call i always trusted ......... if ducks passed u over head or crossing from distance (Ensure they crossed the hideout n going) Blow comeback call now .................\n\nIts magnatic sound if one can blow properly, its quicker than common quack quack with 10 to 12 nodes (Descending sound). Blow it until duck can listen n increase laudness as far as they are going away. \n\nTip is to stop each node with word "K".\n\nNo rocket science, simple chemistry .................. I am sure if these does''nt work, review your spread, hideout, camo, body moments ot something else. Key to success is proper place, one never get closer if u r not on their preferable place.\n\nCreek Calls are fail, just waistage of money they r too low in sound and one cannot change voice instantly according to situation.\n\n\nIts the easiest and perfect tips for our regions. There''s hardly any timber game in the country so make the things as simple as u can. \n\nAs far as Rope hunting is concern SEE my video in my previous post n the broz as mentioned its very easy to get all the ducks from rope. I belive its not that easy. It needs a lot of elements always because u never know whcih bird at what distance and what direction going to approach u.

This one was shooting on the right but with adjustment of sights, it can shoot much better. The groups are not bad.

Your brain should be in constant state of "missle armed" ready to launch. Your eyes must scan the visuals wide and you must be extra stimulated to any moving body in your vision. Even a flying wrapper must draw your attention and mind capable of recording the moment of it. You must be high on adrenaline and your hair erect like a ferocious cat. Any drug use can make you a weak warrior. Even smoking a cigarette dullifies your ambition to fight as level of oxygen to brain is minimized and blood vessels constricted. Ok so NO drugs on high alert SD tasks.\n\n3- Your instinctual connection with the weapon you carry is MUST otherwise dont get involved in SD or you get shot. Requires a lot of training that we all talk about. Starts from shooting on paper and involves step wise to moving targets and then yourself moving as well while shooting. Multiple targets and those time drills make you capable of hitting as many targets effectively in minimum time serves to build confidence AND the so called "instinct" to shoot enemy. \n\n4- Weapon in hand, its reliability and fire power. Your weapon should be a confidence builder and you should like it.\n\n5- Abrupt movements like straffing, ducking, backward and angled backward movements, double tapping, center mass hits, 2 in chest 1 in head are all very much claimed by nearly all experts. They are the real expertise you wanna add to your talent to avoid getting a bullet in your flesh especially when facing a capable enemy.

My bottle of Hoppes powder solvent just finished after about 15 months of use. On average I cleaned about 3/4 guns a week which translates into 200+ guns cleaned per bottle. Less is more :)[/b]\n\n[b][img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/12_resize-1.jpg[/img][/b]\n\n[b]First impressions:\n[/b]\n\nThe Mini06 is available in two calibers in our markets, the versatile and cheaply available .22 LR and the slightly more powerful .25 ACP. I opted for the .22 LR as I already have a wide variety of .22 ammo stockpiled. \n\nBefore buying I checked out atleast 5 other pieces and all had different triggers. The one I bought had the softest so I went for it. The Mini is a really great gun to hold, fits snugly in your hand. The plastic grip and the upwards curving magazine plate secure the pistol in your hand firmly. With a normal pistol three fingers hold the weapon grip whereas with the Mini there is only space for a two finger grip, but it is secure and comfortable. The pistol is the most point able weapon I have ever held simply because it is so small that with your finger on the trigger the pistol ends 4 centimeters from it. \n\nThe build quality is decent and the gun feels quite solid at 500g. Just as a side note and to appreciate Glocks I would like to mention that the weight of the full size Glock 17 is 625g ! The Mini holds 8+1 rounds although the 8th round fits so tight in the magazine that I doubt even cocking the slide will chamber it. \n\nThe gun itself has a 2.5 inch fixed barrel, fixed iron sights which are part of the pistol and is hammer fired. There is no slide realize or decocker and the pistol dis assembly latch also serves as a manual safety to carry in ''cocked and locked'' mode :cool:\n\nAfter fiddling around and reading the manual multiple times I could [b]not[/b] disassemble the pistol. It''s not complicated infact very simple, the dis assembly lug [u]should [/u]popout like the Canik''s / CZ75''s but it does not. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/7_resize-1.jpg[/img]\n\nApart from that there''s nothing much to say about this little pistol except you can carry it around in your pocket and forget it''s there. I will test it at the range InshAllah this coming weekend. It should be interesting as most rimfire (.22) pistols are ammo sensitive.\n\nIt sells for 25 K and is available at PARA, Lahore.', 0, 1, '119.152.149.198', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5402, 148336),

First of all very nice shooting and nice videos, thanks for sharing. I would like to take this opportunity to say that in my very humble opinion, Mozambique Drill is a CQC drill, however, it was born as an offensive drill rather than defensive, but definitely can be applied into defensive as well, Jeff Copper introduced it into modern handgun fighting techniques, it is one of the favorites of the French Counter-terrorist strike teams also BTW, two bullets are fired in the in the torso region, because even if your opponent is wearing an armor, its enough to knock the wind out of them and stop them, and the third bullet is fired at the head to neutralize the threat completely. However, one should first master the technique of quick drawing and shooting before attempting this in a hostile scenario, and also one should keep in mind that if he employs this technique, his opponent won''t be surviving in all possibilities. Also in modern CQC, there are many more techniques currently being used. Also bro, a tip, if you are practicing CQC or CQB, in both of these scenarios, over 80%(that''s a really high stat btw), the engagements occur between 3''-21''. The tip is so next time you can do your drills in these distances also.\n\nNot sure why, but I thought I might add a few things to this thread. :) A very nice topic, thanks again for sharing.', 0, 1, '115.167.78.26', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 148476),

As you know we sleep 8 hours a day normally.\n\nWhat I meant is; you need to be consistently in the state of mind where your mind is ARMED as well as your body is in the highest degree of alertness and agility one can think of. To attain it even a little amount of smoking can cause disruption. Please check my post 2nd point you will know what I tried to tell and sorry for not being clear in my views.\n\nThis highest state of Alertness is difficult to attain with so much consistency and The Execution is even more difficult without the IN-BUILT instinct to shoot your enemy(ies). [check 3rd point in my post). \n\nExplaining it further I would say there is an alert state as well which is usually up when you are carrying a weapon. YOU DO NOT have to be care free and lazy like an unarmed citizen who''s left on mercy of his fate. Ofcourse you dont go around boosing and doping while you carry a weapon and I hope this will bring a picture in your mind about what I am pointing to. AND it is then when you sniff danger is around the corner, you go to high alert and your mind as well as your body is ARMED like a missile ready to launch.\n\nAfter all.. these aspects make you a true defense shield against, a threat to your dignity, posession and loved ones.\n\nAs I have always thought to train an individual as myself, into a certainly more capable threat caused to the threat itself. I have always told my friends that if an aggressor is so down right committed to rob you relentlessly off your possessions why not YOU! the owner of it who has really earned it the right way to hit him in his gutts with the force of rightfulness. \n\nSo we should stay in state of alertness while carrying a weapon on us or this weapon becomes a liability better leave it at home.', 0, 1, '119.152.85.137', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 148604),

As you know we sleep 8 hours a day normally.\n\nWhat I meant is; you need to be consistently in the state of mind where your mind is ARMED as well as your body is in the highest degree of alertness and agility one can think of. To attain it even a little amount of smoking can cause disruption. Please check my post 2nd point you will know what I tried to tell and sorry for not being clear in my views.\n\nThis highest state of Alertness is difficult to attain with so much consistency and The Execution is even more difficult without the IN-BUILT instinct to shoot your enemy(ies). [check 3rd point in my post). \n\nExplaining it further I would say there is an alert state as well which is usually up when you are carrying a weapon. YOU DO NOT have to be care free and lazy like an unarmed citizen who''s left on mercy of his fate. Ofcourse you dont go around boosing and doping while you carry a weapon and I hope this will bring a picture in your mind about what I am pointing to. AND it is then when you sniff danger is around the corner, you go to high alert and your mind as well as your body is ARMED like a missile ready to launch.\n\nAfter all.. these aspects make you a true defense shield against, a threat to your dignity, posession and loved ones.\n\nAs I have always thought to train an individual as myself, into a certainly more capable threat caused to the threat itself. I have always told my friends that if an aggressor is so down right committed to rob you relentlessly off your possessions why not YOU! the owner of it who has really earned it the right way to hit him in his gutts with the force of rightfulness. \n\nSo we should stay in state of alertness while carrying a weapon on us or this weapon becomes a liability better leave it at home.[/quote]\n\n@Mr Taj: Sir, was just pulling your leg :) \nI completely agree with you and I must say your input is very valuable and highly appreciated.', 0, 1, '202.163.71.194', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 148616),

I do not have time to read all the posts between page 1 and page 7.\n\nThis a unique and creative application of several techniques, but I gently suggest they do not mesh together in this way. \n\nLet us start with the first two shots which are fired, "from the hip."  This is also called "firing from retention" - it presumes a  situation where a threat is very close to you (or is engaged in actual CQC) and you do not want to present the gun out so that it could be grabbed.  \n\nThe technique is also used in situations of dire distress- imagine where you are already being shot at and you need to get shots started at or on the threat immediately.  So you would draw and point the gun forward and begin firing from that position.\n\nIn both of the above situations you would attempt to create distance so that you could present the gun into a proper firing position, using the sights to make more accurate and hopefully more quickly dibilitating shots.  AND, you would continually shoot at the threat as you created distance.  This brings me to the next point to consider:\n\nArtificially restricting yourself to two or three shots is largely unrealistic.  The most advanced training training incorporates getting shots on target as fast as possible and continuing to make shots on the threat as long as it is a threat.  The "two to the body, one to the head," mantra is being phased out as prime.  It is retained as a tool, one of many tools, in your self-defense tool-box.  Many law enforcement agencies and military units are training to continually shoot to the body.  "Shoot ''em ''till they drop."  Pour lead into the threat until it stops being a threat.  \n\nI do not think that any shooting skill is impractical.  All situations are possible.  With that said, we should consider the need for more pragmatic shooting skills first.  Think of this: shooting at the head of someone who does not wish to be shot in the head and can do something to prevent himself from being shot in the head, is very difficult.  It is more pragmatic to continually shoot for the larger more immobile body that the small bouncing about head.\n\nMy third observation.  It did not appear that most of the shots were actually hitting the target.  I''m not being mean or insulting.  We are evaluation both the technique and the training.  One gun trainer has a saying, "Any shot that lands on him is good for me and bad for him."  But that requires the shot hit him.  While shooting at a threat could help our situation by making the threat deal in some way with the fact he is being shot at.  Actually shooting the threat is much better for us.  The threat must deal with the fact he has actually been shot.  It may hurt, it may make attacking more difficult or impossible to a limited degree (can''t use his right arm and now only his left arm) or simply impossible.   So firing off shots fast is not as good for you and bad for him as firing off shots both fast an accurate.  There must be a balance.  \n\nShots fired which miss are usually of no benefit and largely harmful to our desired outcome.  We''ve wasted a shot we may need.  We may embolden the attacker who believes we can''t shoot (and he may be correct).  We may create doubt in out own minds that we can survive the situation.  Shots a split second slower (.05 seconds) which hit are much better than shots .05 second faster which hit.', 0, 1, '70.243.166.98', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 148955),

Because of the nature of this relief effort, we can only start from scratch, which is, by involving members from Lahore only. \n\nAbbas brother is going to be In charge of all donations as well as administration of this relief operation and under his guidance and transparent support, we will go forward with this[b] InshAllah[/b]!\n\nWe are open to suggestions and advices from our brothers who are scattered everywhere else in Pakistan. Anyone anywhere can help us, so please, bring in your suggestions as well as realistic approaches towards your input in this regard. Only Lahore members willing to volunteer will be notified about he requirements and our plan of action. \n\nRemember the 2004 Earthquake Disaster? Each and every one of us was united under one objective; Support for our brothers and sisters. Time has once again struck us with this ordeal and as always, InshAllah, we WILL get through this and we WILL not forget our people. \n\nRegards\n\n[b]Image Update;[/b]\n\n[img]http://i29.tinypic.com/1555ees.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i28.tinypic.com/eu2a9x.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i30.tinypic.com/2wlswnr.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i30.tinypic.com/1ono5u.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i26.tinypic.com/v6pzjs.jpg[/img]', 0, 1, '175.110.27.0', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5426, 149016),

The optics position on the sight plane eliminate the need for perfect left/right/ up/down head position. It has an amazing 3-1/2" to 4-1/2" of eye relief, so there is no reason to worry about your eyebrow running into the sight nor any interference with your gripping hand.

Additionally, 30-06 is an ideal choice for African Plains Game and North American game, since it can carry heavier bullets at those velocity which is effective against larger game like Eland, Waterbuck, Elk and Moose. \n\nHowever, if you do want to change your 30-06, consider 7MM Rem Mag or .300 Win Mag both these cartridges will out perform a 30-06 with a 150 gr bullet in factory ammo with a flater trajectory and a big enough punch for all the game present here in Pakistan.[/quote]\n\n\nAhmad Sahab, \n\nWhile you are spot on about the ballistics of the 7mm Rem Mag and the 300 Win Mag. I would still favour the 30-06 for the reason, that in the case of this particular shooter, Mr. Kashif Baig, he seems to be a new comer to the rifle scene. So a mild recoiling calibre such as the 30-06 or even the 7mm would be a better choice for him than any of the magnum calibres. Quite often people who start shooting heavy recoiling rifles, tend to develop the habit of flinching when squeezing the trigger, and that unless nipped in the bud, gets progressively worse with the passage of time, and ultimately becomes second nature, and that leads to consistently poor performance both at the range and in the field. \n\nSecondly, there is plenty of factory loaded military surplus ammo available for the 30-06, and in a well made bolt action such ammo is safe to shoot and cheap too. 7x57 is often loaded locally and unscrupulous dealers often palm it off as factory loaded ammo to unsuspecting buyers. With such ammo not only is there a lot of variation in muzzle velocity, and consequently down range trajectory, point of impact and energy between shots, but also the risk of getting a bullet stuck in the barrel if the powder charge is too low, or worse still the risk of a blown up rifle and grievous personal injury if the powder charge is too high. \n\nThirdly, 7mm Rem Mag and 300 Win Mag factory loads coast at least twice as much as factory loaded 30-06 rounds, and about ten times more expensive than 30-06 military surplus ammo. So practice, which makes many a man perfect, becomes that much more expensive with either of these magnum calibre or with any other magnum calibre for that matter.\n\nSo while, the 7mm Rem Mag and 300 Win Mag, are good choices for the experienced and regular rifle shooter and big game hunter, they might be too much gun for the beginner.', 0, 1, '202.70.157.165', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5435, 149357),

Its a very long debate.(Also try checking stats about people in SD and HD situations who had light on their guns and who didn''t, the results will definitely alarm you)\n\nAs for makes and models and reliability, lets start from the best and carry onwards. In my personal experience, the best lights are made by [b]Sure Fire[/b], they are very reliable, rugged and long lasting, and usually made up to military specifications, battery life is also very good, on the assault rifles I carry, both have a Surefire light mounted on them.\n\nComing towards handguns, surefire is again very good, but I personally prefer the [b]TLR-2[/b]. It has a perfectly focused blinding white light, plus it comes with a laser module, which can also come in handy in many situations. Its rugged reliable and retains perfect zero even on rifles like the AK, and its also made upto mil-spec standards. I prefer TLR-2 because of its size and the materials used in it to built, plus because of the size, it doesn''t look awkward on handguns, unlike the M6X. Looks and works really well on Glocks and HKs from my personal experience without adding a lot of weight. Plus I find TLR-2 a bit more rugged than the M6X.\n\nComing to [b]M6X[/b], its also very good and rugged and believe also built up to Mil-Spes, but I find it looks a bit awkward on pistols with medium to small frames, it sticks out a bit too much for my liking and also adds weight, more suitable for rifles, also because of the 125 Lumens output.  \n\nAll the above mentioned lights I have personally used in many different scenerios and they are still with me, and these are just my suggestions, one should definitely have atleast a light mounted on a gun for HD.', 0, 1, '115.167.78.26', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5431, 149372),

After doing a test-run, we were convinced this is the machine we were looking for. the engraving was deep (enough for my liking). it was also crisp like a high resolution printer. we were instantly sold after seeing the results of the test run (my chromed Zippo lighter).\n\nObviously, next step was choosing a theme and that was TOUGH as hell. which theme to follow? what to engraving based on that theme? to make the matters worst, creativity has never been a quality i''m known to possess. again with the help of Denovo87 bhai and Starfish, I finalized a theme and afterwards the actual engraving design was choses based on that theme.\n\n[b]Here is what it looks like now:[/b]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving3.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving4.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:[/b]\n\n[b]Denovo87 Bhai:[/b] Without Denovo bhai, This would have not been possible. he not only arranged the engraving services but also guided me through every step of the way. the design was finalized, prepped and modified for laser engraving process at Denovo bhai''s facility. besides engraving, he also hosted lunch and an exceptionally fine (Sialkot exclusive) dinner for me, Naveed and Coolbox.

I truly appreciate your kind words.\n\nThe Latin sentence that we see is "Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum" meaning "to make peace, prepare for war". \n\nThe "dragon and tiger fighting" you see is an alternative Chinese depiction of YIN YANG. The Dragon is a symbol of good/defender/right way/care and compassion of others/potent and auspicious powers whereas The tiger, an eternal rival of the dragon is taken as an attacker/assaulter/brute strength/lack of respect for others/lacking compassion. if you look at the artwork you''ll see that both are fighting (an epic battle) and the dragon has its tail over the tiger which means that the dragon is winning. I figured, a firearm can be used for both purposes (right or wrong) however its use should be governed by the choices made after evaluating the consequences of those choices in terms of morality. a "righteous use" should be the "only" use of a firearm.\n\nThe Chinese writing that you see on the top-front of slide also says "YIN YANG". it is used to describe how polar or seemingly contrary forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural world, and how they give rise to each other in turn. I figured, firearms are a sort of a tricky bunch where every action can have severe consequences. similarly a decision on a course of action is based upon its eventual consequences. its an endless cycle of equal and opposite forces.

Eley Club\nb). Federal Game Shok Hollow Points\nc). RWS Club\nd). CCI High Velocity\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/A1.jpg[/img]\n\n\nI started the test by rapid firing Eley Club and was quickly disappointed as almost every second round either failed to eject or simply did not fire. I moved on to RWS club and it performed a little better and jams and misfires decreased by half. I got pretty much got the same result firing Federal Hp''s. I was a little reluctant to use CCI as they are the most expensive of the lot and did not want to waste them on a weapon that has sketchy reliability. Still .22 LR pistols are notorious for being very selective about ammo so I thought I would try one or two mags of CCI as well to complete the test. As soon as the CCI rounds were loaded the pistol turned into another animal and fired flawlessly. Infact rapid fire on this little pistol is just fantastic and a real pleasure, sounds like something from the movies.\n\n[b]A rapid fire target:[/b] (I had not adjusted to the sights yet)\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Rapid.jpg[/img]\n\nIn all I put about 150 rounds on rapid fire though it yesterday and most of them worked fine. The ones that didn''t did not require any effort except either racking the slide to eject the offending round or recocking the hammer in case of a misfire. \nJust when I was about to close the test yesterday and give it average marks, I learnt something strange shooting this pistol, keeping a loose grip eliminated most misfires !? Did Akdal make it that way keeping the fairer sex in mind ?\n\nI thought about would could be causing the FTE''s and immediately remembered Eley and RWS club are subsonic and contain a lesser degree of gunpowder compared to CCI MiniMag and Federal GameShok which are both High Velocity. The higher charged rounds send the slide back properly to eject and load the next round while the lower charged Club''s built for target shooting don''t.\n\nAlthough dirty, I did not clean the pistol after firing 150+ rounds though it yesterday. .22''s get messy fast and I wanted to see exactly how sensitive to fouling it was. Today I took it to the range again uncleaned and had the targets placed at 7M  (33Feet) since that is the maximum distance required for a pistol this size. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/A2.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Shooting RWS Club:[/b] Quickly learnt that sights were quite out of sync.

I can however learn to compensate as the gun itself is shooting quite accurate and consistent. I was also impressed that in two days I fired a total of over 350 rounds though it without cleaning and it worked fine. \n\nIf you decide to buy this gun, keep in mind that it is a delightful little thing but ammo sensitive. Use CCI in it and you will seldom get misfires or jams and even if you do they are fixed by simply recocking the hammer for a second strike or racking the slide to eject the offending round. \n\n[b]Verdict:[/b] I like this little gun and am going to keep it.

How would it be done on SS, any pics of the "test rabbit", the Zippo lighter?\n[/quote]\n\nits not coloring. laser engraving doesn''t not add color to the metal. it basically burns the metal where it meets the surface. each metal decides its own color. the engraver can only chose the right depth according to the desired shade of that color. as a general rule, Laser Engraving on chrome gives white color, on ordinary carbon steel it gives brown to yellow color depending upon engraving depth and on stainless steel it gives light to dark gray, again depending upon depth.\n\nas far as the durability is concerned, the engraving vaporises metal from surface. so naturally, it is subsurface. you''ll have to do serious damage to the metal before you can even touch the engraving inside it. I insisted upon shallow engraving. since it is ordinary carbon steel, if I get it engraved too deep, its gonna bring out the inner metal which will rust (unlike SS) and to prevent rusting I would have to resort to blueing/browning job.\n\nif you look at the pictures again. you can see a scorpion engraved on the barrel. check the color. since the base metal is chromed, the engraved scorpion is white.\n\n[quote=AK47]\nFinally, it must have been quite a work of patience for the engraver himself, having to care for not causing any scratches to the gun during work, I mean when placing the gun between his tools, etc, or perhaps he used some sort of foam to protect it during work? :rolleyes:\n[/quote]\n\nsetting up the piece for the engraving job is the name of the game. the rest is pretty simple. the laser is precise and accurate and there is not such thing is scratches or slippages. laser only engraves where it is precisely told to engrave. the size and exact location on the piece is determined by the operator using red points. once everything is satisfactory, the operator simply fires away the laser and it does everything unassisted. no special jigs are required to hold the piece in place. it is basically laid flat on a table under the laser.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.147.17', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 3960, 149548),

After doing a test-run, we were convinced this is the machine we were looking for. the engraving was deep (enough for my liking). it was also crisp like a high resolution printer. we were instantly sold after seeing the results of the test run (my chromed Zippo lighter).\n\nObviously, next step was choosing a theme and that was TOUGH as hell. which theme to follow? what to engraving based on that theme? to make the matters worst, creativity has never been a quality i''m known to possess. again with the help of Denovo87 bhai and Starfish, I finalized a theme and afterwards the actual engraving design was choses based on that theme.\n\n[b]Here is what it looks like now:[/b]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving3.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Engraving4.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:[/b]\n\n[b]Denovo87 Bhai:[/b] Without Denovo bhai, This would have not been possible. he not only arranged the engraving services but also guided me through every step of the way. the design was finalized, prepped and modified for laser engraving process at Denovo bhai''s facility. besides engraving, he also hosted lunch and an exceptionally fine (Sialkot exclusive) dinner for me, Naveed and Coolbox. Another dish added to my "most wanted" list. Thank you Sir. I truly appreciate all your efforts in making it all possible for me. no matter how hard I try, I fear that I can never truly express my gratitude.\n\n[b]Starfish:[/b] without Starfish''s creative guidance and prompt I.T. services, it would not have been possible. he was always there on telephone and on computer to guide me how to go about my silly engraving ideas. Thanks bro.

What would you say if I told you that they are not mutually exclusive, and that anyone who tells you that they are is wrong? I was once in the “sights all the time at any distance” camp. Then the reality of a reactive gunfight showed me that there are plenty of times when you will not be prepared for the fight, and have to catch up or die. At those times, any short cut is worth all the money in the world.\n\n\nGunfights are either reactive or pro-active. In a pro-active gunfight, you have the information and justification that you need to draw your pistol and shoot. You can call it being pro-active, or even being preemptive to the bad guy''s actions. Recently one of my New Mexico students told me of a case where an estranged husband visited his wife at the deli counter of a local market and proceeded to stab her multiple times with a butcher knife. The restraining order she got against him did nothing to protect her, but a local CCW operator who saw this moved into position, drew his pistol, and reportedly using his sights, shot the gun man to death. That is a pro-active, preemptive gunfight: No startle, no catch up, no problem. The only thing needed is a pistol, marksmanship skills, and the will to use them.\nSuch gunfights, or I should say, shootings, make up the lore of sighted, marksmanship-based shooting methods. But such fights, while very supportive of certain skills, are not the norm. The norm is a gunfight where the other man, or men, has begun the attack upon a relatively unprepared victim. That would-be victim must first realize what is happening; when the information coming in reaches a tipping point that indicates he must act quickly or perish, he must react faster than the bad guy. Does it sound difficult? Does it sound dangerous? Right on both counts. \nWhat is lacking is preparation. I know all about the Color Codes, and about mental preparedness. I also know that human beings are fallible. We are over-worked, preoccupied and sometimes even physically sick. We are rushed, and we carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. Hardly conducive to living in a state of relaxed alertness. Rather than living in Condition Yellow--as my late friend Jeff Cooper described it--we often lapse into Condition Brown: Often sadly inevitable, it is the situation we may find ourselves to be in when the fight comes to us.\n\n\n\nLet''s analyze what happens in a gunfight. You may see the bad guy. He appears to be a bad guy because of his attire, his demeanor and maybe even his . Something about him isn''t right. You catch yourself “profiling”. Unless you have cleansed your mind from politically correct programming, you might chastise yourself for being judgmental. Yet you are receiving bits of information constantly. You notice his eyes and where he is looking. You begin to notice that all the customers in the store are also looking at him. You notice that they appear scared. He is about five feet away now and you notice his clothing seems big for his small frame and you begin to wonder if there is a weapon hidden. Then you begin to notice the outline of a pistol butt and his hand resting on it. It is beginning to move from the belt line and toward you. His first words don''t even register as the adrenaline begins to shoot through your veins. That is how it happens.\nNow let''s look at the rest of the story: You draw your pistol. Actually, it''s more of a grab and shove toward the bad guy than a shooting school range draw. You are looking right at him. Your hunter/predator eye is drawn to the movement of his hand and fixes on his gun. It is small and black. Your pistol is out by now, pointing at him one handed as your body screams, “MOVE!” Still transfixed by the image of him, and visually drawn to the gun moving toward you, you pull hard on the trigger once, twice, three times. Not the controlled trigger pressing you did in school, but hard trigger smashing. Your eyes have not left him as he begins to fall dead at your feet. \nThat is a reactive gunfight and the most likely scenario for the CCW folks. To tell you that it''s all about “Front Sight – Press” here is to insult your intelligence.\nSo what is the answer, point shooting or aimed fire? Are sights useless? Should we rip them off our slides and train only inside elevators? Not at all. Point Shooting and Sighted Fire are two different ends of a continuum of shooting. Shooting is a physical act that does not change. There are degrees to your visual focus (fully on threat, fully on sights or somewhere in between).\nSo, analyze your shooting system. If all you are doing is pro-active sighted fire at medium distance, you may not be totally prepared for what Life''s bad guys have in store for you', 0, 1, '115.186.65.253', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4415, 149881),

As of a tradition of PakGuns, a writeup was due but I was very much busy with some family commitments. So here it goes now:\n\n[img]http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx17/HammadArshad/Targets/Target_31_July_2010.jpg[/img]\n\nYES! I shot my first bullseye with this at 15M. And as you can see that I actually shot 2 in the 10 region. It was deliberate fire in standing position with both hands. \n\nNow I shall write some review about it:\n\n[b]Trigger:[/b]\nP99 is really a dream to shoot. As I have written previously that I liked its trigger so much, at least more than a G17. Its trigger is very crisp and very smooth.\n\n[b]Pointing:[/b]\nAbsolutely natural! very nice and easy. It is actually very balanced pistol, so when you are pointing towards target you actually don''t have to do any struggle, it is as easy as pointing your finger towards it!\n\n[b]Recoil:[/b]\nIt does have very minimal recoil, I am saying it because I have fired G17 and NP17 with the same type of ammo and felt their recoil. So far P99 has the lowest recoil.\n\n[b]Grip:[/b]\nIt came with three changeable grips I didn''t need to change them as it was very nice in my hands and my hands are not big, or shall I say rather small. Still the grip was very nice, very nice Indeed!\n\n[b]Sights:[/b]\nIt has adjustable iron sights, that too for both windage and elevation. I am not sure if they are night sights or not.\n\n[b]Ambidextrous:[/b]\nThe best thing about this pistol is being ambidextrous, very easy to handle and I liked its magazine release which is attached to the trigger guard, I can easily change its magazine without any need to put my finger away from trigger!\n\n[b]Users:[/b]\nNow this is one of the most interesting part. It is actually a service pistol. Its users are as follows (taken from wikipedia):\n[list=*]\n[*]Canada: SPVM (Montreal Police)[/*]\n[*]Finland: Used by the Finnish Defence Forces as the PIST 2003 (Pistooli 2003).[/*]\n[*]Germany: 41,000 P99DAO pistols purchased in 2005 for the North Rhine-Westphalia Police. The State police of Rhineland-Palatinate procurred approx. 10,000 units of the P99Q. The P99Q has also been ordered by the police forces of Hamburg (8,000 pistols), Bremen (2,000 pistols) and Schleswig-Holstein (8,000 pistols) with deliveries between 2009 and 2017.[/*]\n[*]Malaysia: Royal Malaysian Police.[/*]\n[*]Poland:[/*]\n[/list]\nI wish that I had a camera when we (me and @Vik) disassembled it. It is very easy to be disassembled and very few parts and very easy to clean.

Indeed its a skill that can be beneficial in case of injury to one hand/arm in a SD scenario. \n\nFor developing marksmanship though, its another matter entirely and I agree with bro Gilani sb that in the limited time/resources we can allocate to developing this skill, we should try to master it as best we can, meaning that if we can remove ANY aspect of disadvantage, we should, rather than overcoming it with overkill. We could do that, of course, but resources -ammo, ranges, time, are limited\n\nFinally, the development of the life-skill that is shooting is increasingly simplified, and hence made more effective, the lesser the pathways there are to take in order to complete the action. So, on the one hand, acknowledged that dexterity with either hand is beneficial, whereas on the other, to develop an action such that you can depend on it in autopilot, it has to be verrry finite and simple to be effective, with not many bits of information fueling a decision when called upon. Perhaps the most weightage needs to be given to developing one strong hand, AND as a consequence, one strong side. ie wearing a gun, drawing, aiming, cycling, clearning malfunctions, relaoding.\n\nJust my 2C on the matter.

I took the gun out along with a cleaning rod to manually eject the spent shells that might encounter during the breaking in. The situation worsened and I was getting every shell stuck in the chamber.

Those who receive meds should be informed to use it to their max advantage. I pray it passes early, but it is unfortunately known that the incidence of disease will take time in being eradicated and won''t happen unless there is a concentrated and smart effort made in this regard. \n\nThe reason I suggest this is that we''ve seen this before and lessons were learned. When we were trying to provide relief to the earthquake affectees of Oct, 05, many kindhearted people donated many medicines of all kinds. Of more kinds than were known to people who were sending them or ultimately receiving them. Maybe an extreme example, but these included potentially unintentionally abusable meds like systemic or corticosteroids. Where effective in resuscitating nearly lost lives, they could also be life threatening if administered incorrectly. Indeed people fed all AB tablets at once to their sick family members because they thought the condition of patient warranted that. Ji tabiat bohat kharab thi. The human body doesn''t work that way or receive this kindly. Also, injectables vs ingestables vs topically applicable meds werent clear to both sending and receiving. The NGOs i was initially volunteering with were content with gathering stuff, packaging and dispatching it to affected areas. That was only part of the solution and not entirely NOT a part of the problem itself as it turned out later. Why I left that effort. On the ground in affected areas, ONLY when teams of volunteering doctors arrived, took stock of what relief meds were available and what to do with them were we able to be effective with them.\n\nInshallah many lives will be saved. Aside of the rebuilding effort, the other most important effort will be to now protect and sustain these lives with the right medical effort and it is a HUGE effort I realize. But we have doctors and your advice is critically important. We will listen to you bros!

Normally, the social shotgun, even with magazine extension, will hold anywhere between five and seven rounds (I am not considering the relatively scarce magazine-fed shotguns like the SPAS 15 or the USAS 12). The typical battle rifle''s magazine holds anywhere from twenty to forty cartridges, depending on caliber. High capacity drums are offered for certain battle rifles.Take capacity into consideration when you are looking at long arms for home defense.\n\nLastly, the maximum effective range of rifles is typically greater than the range of any shotgun. Ken Hackathorn, in an article entitled "Combat Shotgun Shooting" in Modern Firearms magazine, opines that shotgun is best suited for ranges of 25 meters or less. Consider, however, that for interior home defense situations, you will rarely see one hundred yard shots. Unless you are using your long arm to defend a large parcel of land (e.g., farm houses etc.) then you probably won''t need the extra effective range of a battle rifle. This is not to say that having extra reach is bad (unless it causes overpenetration problems), it merely points to the fact that you should not dismiss the value of a social shotgun based upon maximum effective distance if your particular environment will not require you to reach out and smack a goblin at extended range.\n\nShotguns & handguns may be easier to obtain and so as thier license too, as opposed to your standard "battle rifle".   So for some, it may be the only realistic weapon that can be obtained without extreme hassle from government. \n\nScatterguns are also more economical than your typical battle rifle. A AR-15 type rifle will generally run around 180k-800k, AK-47 will run aroud 70k-280k, Both weapons need Prohibitied Bore license, getting that P.B license itself is a difficult task, while a typical defensive shotgun can be had for 35k-300k on the practical side. For those on especially tight budgets, used shotguns are a good choice -- if you ask me, a used repeater is preferable to a single-shot or double-barrel shotgun for defensive use.', 0, 1, '116.71.209.25', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5454, 150015),

Instead, "gauges" are used.  \n\nAs I understand it, anything larger than a 12 gauge is not recommanded. The point is, you''re limited to 12 gauge for all practical intents and purposes.\n\nThe most popular gauge in world is far and away the twelve gauge. The reason is the twelve bore''s versatility. With the new 3.5" shells, it can match the far-reaching power of the ten gauge, or loaded with 2.0" European shells, it can really be a softie. \n\nThe next most popular bore is the twenty gauge, which can also be loaded up to take 3.0" magnum shells or loaded down with gentle field loads. Less popular is the ten gauge, which is normally used for high-flying birds -- generally not for defense purposes. Rounding out the list are the sixteen and twenty eight gauges and the .410 caliber shotguns.\n\nPopularity should not affect your selection of a shotgun gauge, beyond the question of availability of ammunition and spare parts. You should find a friend who owns a gun in the particular gauge which you have selected and try it out before you go running to plunk your money down at the gunstore.\n\nIf you buy a gun in a gauge that you cannot handle, you will not enjoy shooting it. And if you don''t enjoy shooting it, you won''t practice with it. And if you don''t practice with it, you will not be in a very good position when the balloon goes up and you need to use that firearm to protect your family''s life', 0, 1, '119.153.4.201', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5454, 150320),
(132049, 3863, 131742, 'ACHILLES', 2342, '', 1280922378, 'After you got a gun that fits the you, we need to pick the proper gun for the job. A defense gun normally has several other distinctive features that separate it from your typical fowling piece. \n\n[u][i]Barrel.[/i][/u]A defense gun should normally have a short barrel,typically 18" or 20" in length. Shorter barrels allow for greater manueverability in narrow hallways and the like. , a shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18" (or an overall length less than 26") is a "short barreled shotgun", I''d stick with an 18" or 20" barrel for your defense gun. Anything longer is not my choice,realizing that a shorter barrel will allow you to move better in the tighter confines of your home or apartment.\n\nYour defense gun''s barrel should be a smoothbore. Rifled shotgun barrels are nice, but they really only have one useful purpose -- shooting slugs. We''ll get to ammunition selection later, but in general buckshot and birdshot will perform better in a smoothbore barrel. And rifled slugs are available for smoothbore barrels. So with a smoothbore barrel, you can use slugs, buckshot and birdshot without any real loss of performance. Therefore, from a versatility standpoint, your defense gun should be a smoothbore.\n\nShould your defense gun have interchangeable chokes? I don''t think such a feature is necessary. For defense purposes, if your gun does not have interchangeable chokes, you should choose a gun with an improved cylinder ("IC") or conventional "cylinder" bore (meaning no choke whatsoever). This allows the use of slugs, buckshot or birdshot. Interchangeable chokes are nice on a defense gun but since you won''t be using anything but IC.\n\n[u][i]Sights.[/i][/u] Most plain Jane shotguns will come equipped with a front bead as the front sight. The front bead works well but there are better options for a defense gun. Rifle sights are common on slug guns, and are better than the front bead system. The Beretta 1201FP is an example of a shotgun that is available with rifle sights. Even better is the ghost ring or "peep" sight, as used on the M16/AR15 rifles. These sights incorporate a rear ring and a front post sight. The idea is that your mind will unconsciously center the post inside the ring. The Benelli M1 Super 90 Tactical is an example of a shotgun which is available with ghost ring sights.\n\nTritium night sights are available for shotguns. I am unaware of tritium rifle sights for shotguns, but the Miniature Machine Corporation makes tritium ghost ring sights for shotguns. Tritium vials implanted in the front post and rear ring, allow effective use of sights to give better visibility in low-light situations. I prefer to augment the low-light capability of my defense shotgun with a Surefire Responder.\n\nI likes the ghost rings, especially with tritium inserts.\n\n[u][i]Magazine.[/i][/u] Extended magazine capacity is another desirable feature of a defense gun. While certain hunting regulations in Punjab limit the number of shells available to one''s shotgun when out in the field, there is no such limitation when it comes to defense. The larger the magazine capacity, the better. I like to add a magazine extension so that the end of the magazine tube is almost flush with the muzzle. Anything less in terms of capacity is wasted space, if you ask me. Several companies make magazine extensions for the more popular defense guns, including TacStar and Scattergun Technologies.\n\n\n\nNote to potential purchasers of Remington 870 shotguns. Late production (>1990, I think) shotguns have several nice modifications that will prevent the installation of certain defense accessories on the Remington 870. First, two dimples have been machined into the 870''s magazine tube, preventing the installation of a magazine extension. You can use a drill or Dremel-type tool to remove these dimples. Furthermore, as should you decide to add a TacStar Sidesaddle to a Remington 870 Express or Wingmaster, you will have to chop off 1.75" from your slide, use a Surefire Responder or order a special shortened slide from Remington. Remington supposedly only sells the shortened slide to owners of the Remington 870 Police model.\n\nNone of the above caveats regarding the Remington 870 apply to the 870 Police or Marine Magnum models. I don''t really like Remington shotguns for those reasons.\n\nCertain Mossberg 500 models also have problems with magazine extensions as the barrel band covers the end of the magazine tube so keep this in mind when purchasing a Mossberg 500. There are no problems with adding Sidesaddles to Mossbergs.', 0, 1, '119.153.4.201', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5454, 150323),

I am somehow impressed by the rotary barrel mechanism, and if internal machinery of CF-98 is not upto mark then another good gun with rotary mechanism is stoeger cougar. its only drawback is that its barrel is just 92mm. PT-99 that won the accuracy competition has barrel length of 125mm. you would agree that longer barrels add to the muzzle velocity (resulting in flatter trajectories) and the gun is pleasant to shoot as well. \nWas just wondering if one can get 125-130mm barrel fabricated and install that in stoeger for furthering its range and accuracy - please comment on this one and if you agree with the idea, pls inform if you are aware of a gunsmith who would do a quality job.[/quote]\n\nFalconeer brother, this thread contains accuracy tests that I carried out for different handguns. It was not a accuracy competition per se. \n\nNow coming on to your point. Length of the barrel is just one of the factors when talking about the accuracy of a handgun. More than anything, it provides a longer sighting radius which is a very important factor in accurate shooting. Superior metallurgy and precision in rifling are other important factors which directly contribute towards enhancing accuracy. Good slide to frame fitting and quality of sights are also direct contributers. Than, there are factors that indirectly contribute towards accuracy. Quality of trigger is very important so is the size and shape of grip. All these factors, collectively, contribute towards enhancing the accuracy of a handgun. \n\nYou have seen the results of PT99 which has a 127 mm barrel but have perhaps overlooked the results of Makarov which, like Stoeger Cougar, has a 92 mm barrel but is far more accurate than a Stoeger Cougar and CF98 which has a 110 mm barrel. Similarly, Styer M9, Walther PP and CZ75B Compact also have smaller barrels but are more accurate. What I mean to say is that a longer barrel alone does not guarantee higher level of accuracy.  \n\n[b]If you will get a longer Stoeger barrel manufactured locally, I am quite certain it wont work[/b] because of two major reason;\n\n-  It would be extremely difficult for a local gunsmith to manufacture a barrel with [b]high quality metallurgy and precise rifling[/b]. \n\n-  Even if a local gunsmith manufactures one somehow, [b]I am not sure it would match / work efficiently with the rotary barrel mechanism of Stoeger which has been designed for a 92 mm barrel.[/b] There will be serious feeding problems in my view. Rotary barrel systems are otherwise prone to FTFs. \n\n[b]Easier solution would be to buy a good quality pistol with longer barrel. There are so many available in the market.[/b] Rotary barrel mechanism is not the most efficient system BTW. If it were that good, lot many manufacturers in the last 100 years would have come up with pistols working on this mechanism and most competition guns would have had a rotating barrel. In reality, we see that this is not the case. There are few available options like Cougar 8000, PX4 Storm, CF98, Stoeger Cougar and one odd more. There must be a reason for this.  :)  \n\nBlow back mechanism / fixed barrel is a most accurate system.  \nregards', 0, 1, '203.128.255.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4252, 150407),

As of a tradition of PakGuns, a writeup was due but I was very much busy with some family commitments. So here it goes now:\n\n[img]http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx17/HammadArshad/Targets/Target_31_July_2010.jpg[/img]\n\nYES! I shot my first bullseye with this at 15M. And as you can see that I actually shot 2 in the 10 region. It was deliberate fire in standing position with both hands. \n\nNow I shall write some review about it:\n\n[b]Trigger:[/b]\nP99 is really a dream to shoot. As I have written previously that I liked its trigger so much, at least more than a G17. Its trigger is very crisp and very smooth.\n\n[b]Pointing:[/b]\nAbsolutely natural! very nice and easy. It is actually very balanced pistol, so when you are pointing towards target you actually don''t have to do any struggle, it is as easy as pointing your finger towards it!\n\n[b]Recoil:[/b]\nIt does have very minimal recoil, I am saying it because I have fired G17 and NP17 with the same type of ammo and felt their recoil. So far P99 has the lowest recoil.\n\n[b]Grip:[/b]\nIt came with three changeable grips I didn''t need to change them as it was very nice in my hands and my hands are not big, or shall I say rather small. Still the grip was very nice, very nice Indeed!\n\n[b]Sights:[/b]\nIt has adjustable iron sights, that too for both windage and elevation. I am not sure if they are night sights or not.\n\n[b]Ambidextrous:[/b]\nThe best thing about this pistol is being ambidextrous, very easy to handle and I liked its magazine release which is attached to the trigger guard, I can easily change its magazine without any need to put my finger away from trigger!\n\n[b]Users:[/b]\nNow this is one of the most interesting part. It is actually a service pistol. Its users are as follows (taken from wikipedia):\n[list=*]\n[*]Canada: SPVM (Montreal Police)[/*]\n[*]Finland: Used by the Finnish Defence Forces as the PIST 2003 (Pistooli 2003).[/*]\n[*]Germany: 41,000 P99DAO pistols purchased in 2005 for the North Rhine-Westphalia Police. The State police of Rhineland-Palatinate procurred approx. 10,000 units of the P99Q. The P99Q has also been ordered by the police forces of Hamburg (8,000 pistols), Bremen (2,000 pistols) and Schleswig-Holstein (8,000 pistols) with deliveries between 2009 and 2017.[/*]\n[*]Malaysia: Royal Malaysian Police.[/*]\n[*]Poland:[/*]\n[/list]\nI wish that I had a camera when we (me and @Vik) disassembled it. It is very easy to be disassembled and very few parts and very easy to clean. I will Insha Allah write a review about its internals next time to tell you guys how beautiful it is from inside too! \n\nAs for the outside is concerned, well you will find it one of the most beautiful guns :)\n\nRegards,[/quote]\n\n\ngreat report not bad for 300k', 0, 1, '119.154.125.196', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 2837, 150667),

During chemotherapy, however, one is very prone to infectiouous diseases as all cells, bad, good and ugly are targetted in general, reducing the body''s ability to fight illness etc. Extra care must be taken in this regard. since body gets very weak internally, healthy diet (not heavy on the stomach/liver/kidney) and healthy environment is definitely a must.\n\n\nThe treatments'' success depends on the nature of Cancer (there are atleast 27types of lymphoma''s  alone!).

Single-shot and double-barrel shotguns will do in a pinch for defense, but it''s always nice to have additional capacity in one''s defense gun. Which one should you choose?\n\nPump shotguns are generally more economical and reliable. Reliability, however, is determined mainly by the user. Under stress, people have been known to "short-shuck" pump-action guns, meaning they fail to retract the slide fully to the rear and therefore do not fully cycle the action. This results in a "click" where a "bang" is needed. This can be solved by realistic training -- train under stress (have people shouting at you, etc.) and you''ll be fine. Lastly, pump action guns can be more difficult to operate while in the prone position -- although this can also be solved by training.\n\nSemi-automatics are easier to work from the prone position, but are more expensive and if not kept clean, can be less reliable. However, semi-autos that are properly maintained can be very reliable -- again, it''s a matter of dedication in terms of keeping your gun clean and in good working order. \n\nIf your semi-auto is an inertia-operated gun (i.e., a Benelli or Beretta), you must take special care not to "dress up" your gun such that the additional weight of the accessories changes the inertia of your gun so much that it cannot function with your desired defense load. Adding accessories increases the mass of the gun, and therefore increases the overall inertia of the gun. Supposedly, if one installs a Surefire Responder and TacStar sidesaddle on a Benelli M1 Super 90 Tactical, it will not function reliably with light target loads or the reduced recoil buckshot or slug loads. My Benelli M1 wears only a Surefire Responder and simple sling, and so far I have had no reliability problems with that configuration, but I am unwilling to tempt fate by adding a TacStar sidesaddle.', 0, 1, '119.153.90.154', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5454, 150769),

The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor''s night-adapted vision—for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it submersible to 22 meters. The X300 Rail-Lock® system comes with adapter plates permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X300 when attached to a long gun. \n\n\nFeatures \n•Virtually indestructible LED regulated to maximize output and runtime\n•Tactical-level output with TIR lens for close- to medium-range applications\n•Quick-detach rail clamp\n•Submersible to 22 meters\n•Accepts optional pistol grip and long gun forend switches\n•Construction—High-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec anodizing; impact-resistant polymer; coated tempered window \n•Max Output                     170 .0 lumens \n•Tactical Runtime               2 .4 hours \n•Length                             3 .6 inches \n•Bezel Diameter                1 .0 inches \n•Weight w/Batteries         3 .8 ounces \n•Batteries                         2    123A', 0, 1, '119.153.19.184', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5431, 150819),

The third is of course a meer pipe.\n\nTypes of materials used for making pipes:\n\nBriar wood comes from the root of the briar plant, from Mediterranean region, extremely tough and heat resistant. A briar pipe will last for generations if taken good care of. Meerschaum is a mineral, obtained through mining, used to produce delicate but extremely beautiful pipes, as punjtani bhaee has shown.

Increased Magazines capacity of the .45 ACP handguns vs 6/8 shots of .357 Mag\n\n2). Higher velocity vs heavier projectile (185 gr vs 230 gr)\n\n3). Controllability of the .45 vs the .357 mag. The .45 has much less recoil in a semi auto pistol than a .357 Mag revolver.\n\n4). Accuracy:Due to traveling at a lower fps the .45 ACP is much more accurate, infact used often as a competition round.\n\nThere are other factors too but they don''t really apply for Pakistan.

(132735, 3863, 131742, 'ACHILLES', 2342, '', 1281105971, 'I think we had good in depth view of defence shotgun. What about ammo? Lets have a look about ammo. There are three types of shotgun ammunition: buckshot, birdshot and slugs. I will not talk about speciality rounds like Dragon''s Breath, beanbag rounds or breaching shells.\n\nBuckshot is the all-around defense load. Large lead pellets are the hallmark of a buckshot load. The most popular buckshot sizes seem to be (in descending order of diameter of each pellet): 000, 00, 0, #1 and #4. The larger the pellet, the fewer pellets per cartridge, but the more effective range of the shell. \n\nIn general, remember that the larget the shot size, the greater the effective range and penetration. the maximum effective range of buckshot, for defensive purposes, is around 25 yards. The "best" buckshot that one can use for defense purposes is unknown. It''s like the constant 9mmP versus .45 ACP debate. Just use the one that you can shoot well and that gives you adequate penetration at the desired range, without overpenetration -- you''ll be fine.\n\nThe popular loads in buckshot for defense are the "reduced recoil" loads, from Federal and Remington. These loads are not full-power loads, but are designed for fast follow-up shots. They are apparently very popular among leading law enforcement agencies around the world-- while that''s not always an indication that a product is a good idea, the reduced recoil loads may enable more recoil-sensitive individuals to handle the relatively stout recoil of a big bore shotgun. In some instances, reduced recoil rounds have the added benefit of tighter pellet patterns -- but you should always confirm this by patterning a variety of loads on paper with your particular shotgun. And as always, make sure the load fits the shooter.\n\nwell known defence shotgunners recommends against magnum loads in the defensive shotgun. \n\nSlugs are single projectiles, much like rifle bullets. They come in several varieties, the most popular being the Foster, Brenneke and sabot type slugs. Slugs are good for precise shots, at longer distances. Buckshot and birdshot will lose velocity quickly, due to their relatively non-aerodynamic shape. Realize that larger pellets will be traveling at higher speeds at a given range from the muzzle, compared to smaller pellets. However, effective range of the load may not necessarily increase, because the pellets will spread as the shot string moves downrange. Thus, the overall measure of a load''s effectiveness must take into consideration more than just the kinetic energy of the round. Slugs have the advantage of condensing all the mass into one large projectile (more momentum) and better aerodynamic design. Federal offers reduced recoil slugs for defense purposes.\n\nBirdshot is your typical field load. The load packages a multitude of very small pellets into one shell. At close contact distances (<20 feet) birdshot will behave exactly like buckshot or slugs, as the birdshot will still be locked into the shot cup -- try patterning birdshot at twenty feet and you''ll get one large ragged hole. For this reason, some apartment dwellers like to use birdshot as their defense load -- at close distances (such as those found within apartments) it still packs the punch of buckshot or slugs, but it doesn''t have as much overpenetration power once the shot string moves a decent distance from the muzzle.\n\nDefesive shotgunning recommends against the use of birdshot altogether, stating the penetration is adequate only at contact distances (within a few centimeters). Using birdshot only in strict home defense applications, when distances are short and overpenetration is a big concern.\n\nIn my opinion, buckshot and slugs can be horribly overpenetrative, depending on the distance from the muzzle. Obviously, slugs are the worst and birdshot is the best when it comes to losing energy over distance. Remember that buck and birdshot will lose energy faster over distance due to their poor aerodynamics, when compared to slugs. Choose your defense load based on your surroundings and the structure of your home. If you live out in the boondocks where it''s ten miles between you and your nearest neighbor, slugs and buckshot will do just fine. If you live in a crowded apartment building, birdshot may be more to your liking. But remember, be aware of what''s beyond your target, even if it is ten miles to your neighbor''s house -- it might be your spouse or child beyond light bariers.\n\nWith buckshot, birdshot or slugs, each gun will behave differently. So make sure you take your proposed defense load and pattern the buck or bird at typical contact distance (21 yards or less). Shoot slugs through your gun and see what kind of groupings are possible. You may find that one particular load patterns extremely well. Stick with that load and you''ll be fine.', 0, 1, '116.71.216.210', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5454, 151147),

More so in USA, Europe and SE Asia. I have been to many countries for angling and people are crazy about this hobby for sure. However, like hunting, angling also has its own rules and ethics which are more or less the same. It may not be out of place to mention them here since you are new to this sport. Like:\n\n-  Always differentiate between sport and meat collection. ie, follow the limits. \n\n-  Use such techniques in which fish must have full chance to avoid the bait if she wills so. ie, use of such techniques that make the fish helpless are not allowed. eg, use of nets, explosives, poison or foul hooking (the technique mentioned by Ilyas sahib) are considered beyond the ethics of angling. \n\n-  No fishing during breeding season. \n\n-  If someday one get a bounty catch (lucky enough to catch too many fish) than its not necessary that one would take a truck load home. After one has completed his bag limit, remaining fish should be released. Similarly, undersized fish should also be released. \n\n-  Use of such eatables that make the fish sick should not be done. (this method is very common in Rawalpindi).   \n\n[quote=Xerga]            i m in rwp. we have rawal dam, mangla dam, simli dam etc, and we have alot mahseer ( golden )  fish which is called also CHINA MAHSEER  as well. [/quote]\nBrother, Mahseer is the King of freshwaters. No freshwater fish gives such a ferocious fight as mahseer hence its a prized catch for any angler. The scientific name of the two common types is Tor putitora (golden mahseer) and Tor tor (red fin mahseer). Due to overfishing and illegal fishing, the king of freshwater is getting extinct with every passing day. Sad.........\n\nThe one that you mentioned is Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio) which is one of the most common fish in the world. In urdu, its called Gulfaam. This fish is found everywhere and is considered a pest. Due to this fish, many Pakistani local fish are getting extinct. Somehow, people from Rawalpindi call it a mahseer (China mahseer). IMHO, it''s just like nicknaming a donkey as Lion.   \n\n[quote=Xerga]         i want to have any experct advice on this, what might be the best bait for china mahseer fish? i use white wheat, chemical made with some herbs etc, we use live baits as well. \n \n         in said places, besides golden mahseer,  rohu, narain, eels ( baam machli ) are also available...  \n  \n                                    any expert advice? [/quote]\n\nThe type of bait depends on the fish that one is targeting. For carps like Rohu, Mohri (Narain), Thela, Gulfaam, Grass Carp, Kalbanse, Torki etc , (which are mostly vegetarian) grain oriented baits and worms work the best. For meat eaters like Sowl (snake head), Singhara, Malhi and Khagga, live baits (small fish, frogs, leeches etc) work the best. Earthworms can also be used. This method is called BAIT FISHING. In bait fishing for carps, ground baiting the area before fishing is important. This is done by throwing some good smell eatables in the areas where one intends fishing, in order to attract the fish in that area. A mixture of rice, pulses and different herbs is made for this purpose and is locally called Charai. Please make sure no harmful ingredients that spoil a fish''s stomach are used.  \n \nMeat eater can also be caught with artificial lures (jiggs, spinners, spoons, plugs, soft plastics etc). This method is called LURE FISHING. \n\nMeat eaters and some vegetarians can also be caught with Fly Fishing technique which is the most difficult of all the techniques and is used by expert anglers only. \n\nBest fishing timings during summers are early morning and evening. For predators (specially mahli), night fishing with live baits is the best. \n\nAll  the best in this wonderful sport.  :)', 0, 1, '203.128.255.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1865, 151149),

They are in distress nowadays as their habitat has been severely disturbed. Big fish would still stay in the main stream. However, many would be found in flooded areas also. The moment water will start receding, the fish will run for the deep waters but many would not be able to make it and would be caught in the ponds.

You know snakeheads have to come up on the water surface to breath after a while and that is the time when it can be shot. Have also done so with a 12 bore. For that, one has to climb up a tree on the water bank and keep looking at the water with lot of concentration. A sowl would come up on the surface for breathing for a fraction of a second and that is the time one has to shoot. Requires lot of alertness but quite thrilling. Could be an anti-climax also if the shooter fails to maintain his balance on the tree.  :lol:', 0, 1, '203.128.255.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1865, 151210),

The scope had weaver clamps/ jabrai that of a rifle (broad) so went to lucky star and exchange them with smaller clamps which would fit on ma gun.\n\nNow when i fitted the scope, my rear sight was coming in the view thus creating a serious distraction and secondly the scopes setting dial was touching the gun barrel and would not let me rotate the dial, not to mention that it might have caused damage to the scope while firing. Thus i went back to lucky star and got small but TALLER clamps. The view was perfect and the dial would move.\n\nHere comes the problem, with taller clamps and a relatively heavier scope after every 20 shots the front clamp would come out of its groove.

Again after 80 or so shots the rear clamp collapsed from the gun recoil.\n\nNow i am in a fix, i tried to find a RAIL for the gun but that is not available, other then the option of getting a tesco 2-6x28 scope which is lighter in weight and nothing as good as bushnell, i dont know how to hold that scope steady on the gun.

(133016, 3889, 0, 'PUNJTANI5', 146, '', 1281190974, 'i own a .32 revolver for HD and SD purpose \n\nA revolver is a wonderful weapon. It can be used for self protection or target shooting. The .32 bore revolver is best suited for use by an average person. It is neither too small in size and nor large as say a. 45. There are many makes of .32 revolvers available in the market. You can have your pick from any number of manufacturers in the market. But the prominent ones which I recommend is the Webley Scott or Smith and Wesson or colt or Arminius etc. Any gun owner knows that proper cleaning and maintenance of his equipment is not only the key in increasing the weapon''s lifespan, but is necessary to ensure its safe operation. There are many ways to clean a revolver, as there are stars in the Milky Way. When you decide to clean your revolver see that you have some free time available. Hence it will be good idea to use a Sunday or holiday for this purpose.\n\nTo start with select a small table and place it in a well lighted area of your house or the porch. It is preferable that you sit in a place where natural sun light is available. Get your revolver and examine it carefully from the outside. The next step is perhaps the most important and concerns your safety. Open the Chamber of the revolver and see that it is unloaded. In case you have bullets in the chamber take them out and keep them aside. Make doubly sure that the revolver is empty of bullets. In addition hold the opened barrel against the light to ensure that no bullet is in the barrel.\n\nSecondly get your cleaning kit and oils ready on the table. You will require the following \na) A Gun oil \nb) A solvent \nc) A wire bore brush with a small handle and rod. Ensure that it is compatible with the bore of the .32 \nd) Pieces of cleaning cloth or rags \ne) Patches.\n\nThirdly use the solvent with a hard brush on the outside of the revolver. You may if required use a tooth brush for this purpose. Clean the revolver thoroughly with the solvent to remove any rust or other marks. Continue till the revolver is absolutely clean. In case you are cleaning your weapon after a long interval then it will be good idea to remove the rust marks if any with zero number emery paper.\n\nFourthly dip your bore brush again in the solvent and run the brush through the barrel of the revolver. The barrel will have grooves and once clean will be clearly visible. After this hold the revolver against the light and use the brush to clean the bullet chambers. Remember the brushes available are of different sizes for different weapons. Ensure you use the correct size so as not to damage the barrel bore. The bore brush when it moves in the barrel will twist with the grooves.This is a good sign and allow the brush to follow its natural movement.\n\nNext clean the extractor rod and push it inwards to check its springs is in good shape. Rotate the cylinder with your hand to see that the circular motion is free.This is important as the revolver chamber is to move automatically with the release of the trigger.\n\nLastly wipe the revolver clean with a dry patch both from inside and outside. Take the gun oil and apply it to the moving parts of the revolver. With a patch lightly rub the oil all over the weapon. It should now give a clean and shiny look.\n\nHow often you clean your revolver will depend on your usage. Remember the revolver is a handy weapon and keeping it properly with regular cleaning will make your weapon last a long time. But in case there is more to the weapon and some major defect crops up then take it to a qualified gunsmith.\n\nThe final step concerns storage of your revolver. Keep it in a holster and lock it up in cupboard or almirah. See that children have no access to the weapon. Always store the revolver unloaded and the bullets in a separate case', 0, 1, '119.154.112.172', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5507, 151456),

Amongst these two, there is no match and 608 in 357 mag (in 6" barrel) is definitely a winner in my view. However, if we change the platform and have a Colt 1911 or Kimber 1911 or STI 1911 or H&K Mk23 in .45 ACP versus Taurus 608 in .357 Magnum than definitely, I would change my priority and go for the former, primarily because they are better guns. Again, if we have a Colt Python firing a .357 Mag then we may have to reconsider the priority once more, depending on our purpose for which the handgun would be needed. \n\nYou see, there cant be a precise answer to a generalised question like which one is better, .45 ACP or .357 Mag? Well, it depends on the requirement / use, on the platform from which this ammo would be fired and many other factors. However, what we need to keep in our mind is  that .357 Mag is primarily a revolver cartridge and .45 ACP is primarily a pistol cartridge; they would give their optimum performance on these platforms (in suitable make and weight).

With the left hand, all in the bull and almost the same size of group. With the right hand, the group this time is a horizontal one, with only one bullet hitting 6 o''clock in the nine ring, which is my fault. The difference in the location of the group might have occurred because shooting position was different and perhaps the point of aim was also a little different.

Unlike US and Europe where the bulk of fish are predators (hence can be caught on artificial lures), bulk of Pakistani fish are carps which are primarily vegetarian. Therefore, bait fishing is a more productive method in Pakistan. Secondly, due to over / illegal fishing, the fish stock have drastically reduced in Pakistan (like all other game). If there are few fish, trying to catch them with an artificial lures is quite an effort and usually ends in frustration for the anglers.

You just have to go to the right place. You can find a lot of sowl in the lilly ponds but your 3 lb line wont work there. It wont work with mahseer as well who will just break this line in a split second. Such is the power of mahseer. So I would advise a 10 lb line with a 8-12 lb rating rod in ponds / streams of Punjab. With a very weak line, you would loose fish and would also loose lot of lures. However, for trout fishing, 6 lb line would be good enough but again, our streams and lakes in NAs are very stony and again you would loose lot of lures due to abrasion. 10 lb line with a matching rod and # 1 to #2 Mepps spinners provide good sport for trout.  :)\n\n\n[quote=Reincarnated]Dear Gilani bro\nThats some very interesting infos you posted up there. \n\nWould you be kind to shed some more light for any new aspiring anglers on some basics? Like which fishing rod to begin with (and the availabilty of the same locally) and the best areas to go for a family fising picknicks? :) \n\nThanx[/quote]\n\nBrother, to start with, I would suggest you go for bait fishing equipment. This is the easiest and most productive technique. Lure fishing is a bit difficult for a beginner and the eqpt is also more expensive. For bait fishing, you can buy two bait fishing rods, two reel, 15-20 lb line, hooks (#3,#4 and #5 would do), a landing net, a keep net and few other small accessories which can be bought from any angling shop in Rawalpindi (there are many of them). An average standard made in China kit of the above kind would cost around 5K. For upgradation, there is no limit and one can have rods upto 300 $ and reels upto 1000 $.\n\nHappy fishing brother  :)', 0, 1, '203.128.255.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1865, 151549),

The proverb, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, does not hold good in Pakistan. Here, one may get a quality weapon very cheap and may have to pay 200k or above for an average quality thing. However, somehow many of us are fascinated by high price things and consider the cheaper things as trash. The dealers in our country exploit this psyche to the fullest. \n\nFederal ammo is a good ammo but not an outstanding ammo by any means. But since its expensive, it has to be great. Secondly it comes from USA, so it has to be great. Russian ammo has always been the cheapest, quite reliable and very accurate. As you must have seen in the tests, POF and Russian ammos perform equally good and in few cases better than the other ammos and are cheaper as well. The only problem in POF and Russian ammos is to find the original ones as there are too many fakes around.  :)', 0, 1, '203.128.255.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5238, 151577),

As early as 1986, in the NRA''s book Handloading stated that "the modern science of wound ballistics has established beyond reasonable doubt that the 9mm cartridge is highly effective."\n\n"Lethal Force expert Massad Ayoob has stated that the "Tried, Tested, and True" 115 grain +P or +P+ is the best self defense load in this caliber"\n\n"The energy of this cartridge is capable of imparting remote wounding effects known as hydrostatic shock in human-sized living targets. The existence of this phenomenon was debated in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, recent publication of human autopsy results have demonstrated brain hemorrhaging from fatal hits to the chest with 9mm bullets."\n\nIn my humble opinion, 9mm Para is the most efficient handgun cartridge ever designed. there may be more powerful and lethal handgun cartridges out there but none do it as efficiently as the 9mm Para. when I say efficiently, I mean, sufficiently lethal while keeping the recoil, controllability and cost to a minimum. another big time plus of this handgun cartridge is that besides the availability of foreign made cartridges in this caliber, it is also locally produced therefore maximizing the chances of availability in dire times. another big time plus is the variety of handguns available here in this caliber.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.152.161', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5531, 152053),

CF98 is the only foreign made decent entry level handgun in the market\n2. what it offers in its price range, no other gun offers\n3. our objective is not to gauge out entry level guns as they have their own standing in the market. our objective is to gauge the popularity of handguns available in 35K to 65K range. this is where the most variety exists in the market.\n4.

This is a question that''s been at the forefront of discussion amongst the most prestigious scholars and lawmakers of the world. Finally, after getting them all together - the question has been answered.\n\nA: Such number as may be deemed necessary to perform the stated task in a timely and efficient manner within the strictures of the following agreement. Whereas the party of the first part, also known as ''the lawyers'' and the party of the second part, also known as ''the light bulb'' do hereby agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed upon duties, i.e. the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the front (North) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just through the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties. The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:\n\n1. The party of the first part shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, step stool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part and rotate the party of the second part in a counter clockwise direction, said direction being non-negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part shall be undertaken by the party of the first part to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part, notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part to perform the customary and agreed upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case the party of the first part shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as the non-negotiable directional codicil is observed by the party of the first part throughout.\n\n2.

Spleen and lever chunks are good for malhi (should be rich in blood). Khaggas can be best caught on live minnows of 4-6 inch size. \n\nI am not aware of any good fishing tackle shop in Lahore, you will have to ask some local.

I must say it''s not only a beautiful gun, but also a good one. The trigger is just right and the "built in" hogue gives one very solid grip to the shooter.\n\nI''m not in a position to say much about the accuracy, coz only an experienced shooter like Gilani Sb would be able to speak on the gun itself, but from the pics above, you can see what an "amateur" could manage to accomplish at least. Apart from the first chart above, shooting in standing position from 40 ft, rest of the firing from 25 ft was done in a sitting position, with a pillow for support, beneath my elbow.  I chose this distance simply because I thought it would be best for me to report back on, and also coz I feel this is the most common range of SD situations.  :)   \n\nThere was some PT 145 shooting as well, but I shall post in separate thread shortly.

I twisted a single strip over the rod like a screw and sprayed with WD40, taking care not to leave any portion of the rod uncovered. I inserted it from the rear, loading (breach??) end, "screwing" it in following the rifling twist in the barrel. Went for the entire length. Repeated the process until the strips started coming out clean. Now the barrel''s inside shines like it''s made from glass.

Almost ALL, in fact ALL pipe tobacco is processed in one way or other. The only unprocessed tobacco available, may be the desi, locally grown tobacco. IMO such a tobacco will be too harsh to smoke in a pipe, could be used in huqqah since the water will filter and cool the harsh smoke. And no tobacco is free of tar because tar is not an additive. It''s a natural byproduct of burning ANY plant matter. The tar-levels vary of course from plant to plant. \n\nThe only processing [b]good-quality pipe-tobacco[/b] undergoes is fermentation. Tobacco leaves grown for pipe-tobacco are bundled and sealed under high pressure, increased humidity and temperatures (like our weather in rainy season) and is left for a specific time-period. During fermentation, the harsh alkaline chemicals in the tobacco break down into more manageable (smoke-able) aromatic compounds. Also, [b]every[/b] pipe tobacco, from Captain Black to Dunhill, have added [b]flavors[/b]. As a result, the smoke not only becomes milder but also takes acquires an aroma typical to that type of tobacco. Fermentation also alters the tar level of tobacco. The [b]cheaper[/b] tobaccos however, have more artificial, distinctly chemical and "in-your-face" type flavors while the high-quality tobaccos have subtle flavorings which bring out the natural taste of tobaccos...\n\nAdditives (in the true sense of the word) are added only to cigarette tobacco to:\ni) improve its burning speed.\nii) make it easy enough to inhale.\niii) to allow for maximum nicotine delivery.\n\nGood (even average) quality cigar/pipe tobacco is free from such additives. Flavorings are added to pipe tobacco while the flavors in cigars come [b]solely[/b] from the aging time and method.\n\n:cool:  :)', 0, 1, '119.153.105.181', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5357, 152951),

I have been meaning to ask you something for quiet some time and usually shy away however this time I''ve decided to shoot away the question that have been lurking in my mind for so long.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. your handgun doesnt seem to recoil at all even though you are shooting .45ACP which recoils alot compared to 9*19mm. is it the gun? or the grip? or some other technique that you employ to tame the recoil?[/quote]\n\nThat is a great question and you should not have waited to ask it. \n\nIt''s not really the gun or the grip.\n\nThere are a number of different things at play which keeps the recoil managed:\n\n[u][b]1- Mechanical[/b][/u]\n[b]a- I run a slightly reduced load.[/b]  I fire 230 grn bullets at 750 fps.  This about 100- 150 fps less than "full power loads."\n[b]b- Lighter recoil spring [/b](about 15.5 lbs). Mostly because of the lighter loads, but lighter recoil springs help reduce muzzle flip.  I get more recoil directly back.\n\n\n[u][b]2-Bio-mchanical/Technique[/b][/u]\n[b]a- I passively resist the recoil.[/b]  I tighten certain tendons in my wrist so that it is stiff.  \n[b]b- I don''t actively fight the recoil.[/b]  What recoil happens I allow to happen;  The slide come back, the muzzle rises, the slide moves forward and the muzzle drops back to it''s starting point (right on the target).  I let this happen.  This gives the illustion of less recoil bcause I don''t have to adjust the gun after the slide chambers the next round.  When the slide action stops I am right back where I want to be.  Again it''s a bit of an illusion, there is still recoil, I simply manage it.\n[b]c- lean forward a bit in the gun and with ever so slightly bent elbows [/b]\n[b]d-  I gently tighten the muscles in the forearms, biceps, triceps, and shoulders.[/b]  [color=red][u]This very subtle[/u][/color].  I don''t want to be floppy and loose so that the recoild bends my elbows and shoves my shoulders back.  But neither do I don''t want to be so stiff that the energy of the recoil jars me.\n\n\n[quote]2. the rear sights of your pistol seems to me that it doesn''t have white dots. is there a reason for that? omitting white dots helps?[/quote]\n\nYou are right, the rear sight is flat black.  My front sight has a fiber-optic insert that glows a nice bright red circle in the front sight.\n\nI don''t think it helps, I don''t think it hurts.\n\nI believe sights are largely a preference.  I doubt anyone can prove one sight set up is better than another, though they may believe their arguments and opinions are definitive.\n\nI and many competive shooters don''t like the three dot set up.  But, they have their place.  For close shooting- picking up white-dots and seing three white dots mostly lined up works well enough.  I get the same quick sight-picture with my fiber-optic dot in the front sight and the notch in my rear sight.  \n\nI have seen all kinds of sights, and each is working for the shooter using them.  \n\nI liked the white dot and white outline on the Glock.    \n\nTruth be told for accurate shooting one should be using the top edge of the front and rear sights.  The dots aren''t used at all.\n\n[quote]I would immensely appreciate if you could also post a few pictures of your handgun grip. if controlling recoil is some kinda posture thingy, then in that case, kindly post picture of the complete posture (head-toe). kindly also illustrate/demonstrate your trigger control.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\nHere ya go:\n\n[url]http://pakguns.com/videos1.php[/url]\nMine is the second video.\n\nAlso:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mEoYHdpuLY[/url]', 0, 1, '144.160.98.31', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5552, 153006),

How being a good shooter is related to being a good lover.\n\nStance- is mostly for show, like how a man dresses.  It may make him look good.  He needs to be comfortable.  If he feels better about himself he''ll usually perform better.\n\nGrip- it''s like how you hold a woman in a hug, or hold her hands, touch her face.  It should be firm, but not too firm.  Controlling, but not damaging.  It makes a statement about how you may perform.  It says something about your potential, but it''s not the goods.\n\nSight-Allignment/Focus/Picture- is like foreplay.  It make a huge difference in your performance.  It will affect how quickly you score a bulls-eye... put one in the X-ring.  \n\nTrigger Control- is everything.  It seperates the great lovers and great shooters.  You can''t just slam down on the trigger.  You have to be gentle, smooth.  You can ruin all the effort stance (putting on good looking clothes), grip (hugs, holding hands, caress her face), and sight-allignment/focus/picture (foreplay), by thinking you can just slam it home.\n\nThere is a time for rapid slamming the trigger (in both contexts), but most of the time your have to be a master manipulator of the trigger.\n\nAnyways, that''s initial analogy.

I would like to add a few points. \n\nUse a dropper or syringe to put solvent onto brush so as to avoid contaminating the solvent or wasting it.\n\nBarrel should always be cleaned in direction of bullet leaving it otherwise accuracy can suffer and rod can hit firing pin area at the back. So get a flexible wire rod like in otis cleaning kits and put wire rod from cylinder side and pull out.\n\nNever use holster for storage as the oils in it will eat away the steel over time. Also the storage area should not be airtight as it will cause rusting of revolver internal parts especially in blued finish. Also dont store in foam lined box as it captures moisture and can stick to gun finish.\n\nUse the best oil you can find hoppes 9 and lightly cover the outside, barrel and cylinders, shroud rod internals. Too much oil attracts dust and not good.\n\nCheck on weapon every 3 months or maximum 1 year.\n\nYou should spend money on maintenance and storage. What i use is Otis cleaning kit pouch smaller in size than a cd, hoppes 9 solvent, hoppes 9 oil, cotton patches made from old vests, clp break free from otis for internals of gun grip and screw, dropper for solvent, brass and plastic brush attachments from otis kit, soft tooth brush.\n\nI store in a plastic zipper bag open at the top  and placed in a normal hand bag with silica gel pouches.

Nice to see the discussions as active as ever. I would also like to applaud the efforts of the admin and the members in their contributions towards the flood relief fund.\n\nSome good news. My A Levels results came out yesterday. My A* and a couple of Bs are sufficient to get me into the university of my choice.\n\nHowever, that means I''ll be leaving my PG family behind...\n\nEver since I joined PakGuns back in May 2009, I found it to be an excellent discussion platform, an unlimited knowledge base, and above all, a place where I could rant on and on about guns and related stuff :D. The spirit of community and brotherhood in this forum of like-minded gun enthusiasts is astonishing; members of this family are forever willing to advise and lend a helping hand to those who have the courage to ask and a thirst to learn\n\nHonorable Chief, Respected Moderators: It was an honor serving under your command. Your strict-but-fair policies have ensured that this forum will continue to grow in a disciplined fashion. Your prompt handling of mischief-makers and your welcoming attitude towards well-meaning newcomers are a couple of things that I deeply admire.\n\nPS: Chief, you owe me fifty rounds :P  (I just can''t find the post where you said this :D)\n\nHonored PakGunners: It was a great pleasure, being part of such an enlightened forum. Initially, I believed that I would be ignored or not taken seriously due to being one the youngest members when I joined; however, such reservations were proven wrong. Your praise and applaud at my contributions strengthened my zeal and encouraged me to give more to the forum. In addition, I''ve learned something from all, be it weapon related or otherwise. It was the encouragement I received which led me to comment heavily and reach the rank of Member Extraordinaire. In the end, my only regret is that I was unable to attend any of the official PG GTGs, and therefore, unable to meet any of you in person. Hope to make up for it when I get back...\n\nTwo names must be mentioned here. I consider them my teachers in my amateur efforts at airgun shooting. My salute to Sir Skeeter and Sir Gilani. Your advice will be remembered for the rest of my life.\n\nSince I will be abroad, I will refrain (and restrain myself :P) from logging into this forum, for reasons of safety and security. Lets face it, Pakistanis abroad, students in particular, are viewed with a certain degree of suspicion. Add to that a hobby which involves weapons... and things become quite sticky...\n\nWhen I return after completing my studies, I will be glad to once again become part of this forum, and continue from where I left off. In the meantime, I request you all to pray for my success in higher education and subsequently, my career.\n\nMay Allah help our nation in these troubled times. May the Almighty give us the serenity to change the things we can change, to accept the things we cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nIf PakGuns requires my humble services, contact me via email.

They have some advantages and some dis advantages.\nThere is no BEST rifle and no BEST caliber.\nA caliber meets and suits certain requirements depending on the  game to be hunted and the terrain where you want to hunt.\n\nIf you are  going to hunt under 200 meters range and the animal is the size of a Hog deer, a Black buck etc the 243 is good.\nIf you want to take the same animals and also Urial at real long ranges the 270 and the 30-06 are hard to beat.\nIf you want Himalayan Ibex and and other mountain game than again the 270, the 30-06 and 7mm Rem Magnum are  very good. \nThe 7mm Rem Mag has more authority and better wind deviation and flatter trajectories ,  they all recoil the same to me. I have never found any difference in recoil of the three  calibers .\n\nIt is a matter of personal preference. The 243 should not be used beyond 200 meters on game the size of Urial and bigger animals.\n\nYou have a great choice of bullets in the 30-06 ( 55 grain accelerator, 130, 145, 150, 162, 165, 180 190, 200, 220 and a new 250 grainer). These are capable of taking down all game in Pakistan.\n\nIn the 270 you have only one 130 grain bullet, although the 150 grain bullet is there but it has a poor trajectory when compared with the 130 and again the 140 is a compromise bullet. How ever the 130 grain bullet performs extremely well on big game with a fairly flat trajectory at long ranges.\n\nIn the 7mm Rem Mag again you have a good choice of bullets from 130 to 175 grains ( 120, 130 139, 140, 145, 150, 154, 160 , 162, 170, 175 and even a new 190 grainer)  and is very effective and very flat as compared to the 270 and the 30-06 with bullets of comparable weights and meets  desired   requirements with much more   authority  at longer ranges.\n\nIt is a matter of choice . I have tried to explain very briefly the characteristics of these calibers but there is much more to it and it can only be discussed around a log fire in a hunting camp where each one will debate his favourite caliber is the best.\n\nAs I said earlier all  calibers  have good points .  It is a matter of your choice based on the type and size of game you want to take.\n\nI hope I have been of help AR Lover.

I am sure you know that a grain is the smallest unit of measurement for weight in British system. There are 437.5 grain in an ounce. or 1 gram = 15.43 grains  \n\nAmmo manufacturers keep experimenting with different shapes, sizes and weights of bullets in a particular caliber, in their quest for achieving optimum performance with regards to factors like accuracy, ballistic performance, range, penetration power, stopping power, weapon functioning etc. Hence bullets of different grainage in the same caliber.  \n\nStandard grainage and shape of a bullet in a particular caliber provides a balanced or compromised performance with regard to most of the above mentioned factors. For achieving outstanding performance in any of the above factor (which at the same time may result in a compromised performance in some other factor), one may have to change the bullet weight, shape and even size alongwith the quantity / quality of propellant inside the cartridge. eg, a bullet designed to achieve max range and penetration may fall comparatively short on accuracy and vice versa. Specialist shooters therefore need to have this knowledge that which cartridge in a particular caliber gives optimum performance in events like say long range hunting, long range sniping, precision shooting etc etc. For most of us, standard grainage bullets would do the job  :) \n\nThe exact details / effect would differ for different grainage ammos in different calibers and would require a comprehensive study on the subject.

Other experienced members are requested to give their input so that the effort undertaken during these tests becomes rewarding for all us with regards to capabilities of different ammos tested. \n\nLet me mention here that my Taurus PT99 was zeroed on POF2Z, the ammo that I mostly fire during my shooting practices. Throughout the test, the weather was cloudy and the wind was blowing from my right to left. \n\n[b]Now few observations:[/b]\n\n-   [b]POF2Z[/b] (four different lots), on which the gun was zeroed, [b]was shooting generally in the bull area, slightly over the bull in certain cases.[/b] S&B and Federal also generally shot in the same area which means that a gun zeroed for POF2Z would fire these two ammo in the same area. There was hardly any deviation towards any direction and this may be because these ammo were strong enough to neautralise effects of mild wind at 20M. \n\n-   Most of the 115 grain ammo like [b]POF1Z, Russian Ulaynosk, Armscor FMJ were hitting a little below and mostly left of the point of aim. [/b]Hitting low may be due to the low muzzle velocity of these rounds and hitting on the left consistently may be due to the wind direction that was from right to left (270 degree from the direction of fire). Because of less weight of the bullet and lower MV, the bullet drop was more and the wind had more pronounced effect on these ammos taking them to the left, as compared to POF2Z, Federal, S&B and JHPs.  \n\n-   [b]Both the JHPs,[/b] which were 124 grain high muzzle velocity ammos (more powerful than POF2Z, Federal and S&B) [b]were hitting above the bull[/b], ie, the point of aim. Armscor JHP, which has a more flatter nose (please see the pics for comparison) deviated more towards the left as compared to Serbian SJHP which has a comparatively pointed nose. \n\n[b]This raises few interesting questions;[/b]\n\n-   Would the lower garinage ammos with lower muzzle velocity have a higher bullet drop and would deviate more during windy conditions as compared to higher grainage bullets with high muzzle velocity?? \n\n-   Would JHPs, being higher MV ammos, always hit higher on the target as compared to other ammos? \n\n-   Would JHPs with flatter nose be more susceptible to deviation during windy conditions as compared to SJHPs or normal FMJs (which have a more pointed nose), even though they have a higher muzzle velocity as compared to standard grainage ammos of that caliber ??\n\n-   Many of us are in habit of using standard 115 grainage ammos during our shooting practices but carry high muzzle velocity JHPs in the same gun when carrying it for SD. How important it is to know the difference in point of impact of two different ammos???

You may recall the experience we had when SA was around, with the tight grouping of the 185 gr .45 Serbian SJHP vs 230 gr Armscor FMJ. The former is loaded just right in relation to its grainage (185), thus must have a higher MV also, hence the results, and for the latter one (the 230 gr FMJ), better "propellant" may be required to obtain same results, like i.e moving on to the SXT type .45 ammo with higher MV.  :)  \n\nHandloading is actually the name of the game here, for customization, yet unfortunately, not commonly possible for us.  :|  \n\nFinally, in [b]SD[/b] situations, I personally think the marginal deviations will be of minimal effect, coz for the common man,[i] in the haste of emergency retaliation[/i], it''s mainly wild "torso" shooting, nothing deliberately targetted, nor is there any time for that.\n\nYet course, being loaded with the right stuff is preferable, especially for the LEA agents, for better accuracy and consequently better stopping effect also.

Or is it purely on the basis of judgement, experience, knowing your rifle and calibre ?\nYou are correct about stalking and getting close to the trophy before shooting it. I have seen it on various hunting videos on youtube aswel. But if I may ask, isnt it more fun to take a calculated shot from a longer distance, checking the trejectory , wind pressure etc ?

Try to get close to a sitting crow by hiding yourself behind trees or peep from a window at close range and then take a shot.\n\n I personally feel that this approach makes you feel that you have really hunted something because it includes the core essentials of hunting i.e stalking and giving a chance to the animal to run away if it feels threatened.', 0, 1, '115.186.119.177', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5555, 153438),

So before shooting you need to verify that the speed of wind where you are located and next to the target is same. You can do that easily by comparing how much grass is bended in both locations. Or if its a hot weather then do it by mirage waves. :)  That only works if you are targeting long range but for 100,200, ...400 yards very little effect. You will see professional sweating if winds are around 20mph or above as mentioned by Skeeter60.\n\noptimal placement relays on sum of all winds if uni directional or subtract if different direction. \n\nand yes if wind are from you towards target then it has very little effect almost none. But for large game hunt you really dont want to have such a position as air will carry smell of yours right to the animal. \n\nSummary of all above ... \nBullet can travel zigzag under different air or you call it turbulence. \n\nI have this software where you can learn all the calculations and shoot with 3 different calibers include .308 , .338  .50 on different ranges to have something on you before you go real times.

An average of 40 people/vehicle were evacuated by putting a temporary deck to accommodate men on upper deck and women and children in the pickup tub.\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898389278_1587973227_1092485_3151664_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898349277_1587973227_1092484_6012164_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898229274_1587973227_1092481_5219552_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898189273_1587973227_1092480_2184951_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898149272_1587973227_1092479_7231310_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40175_1459958230774_1587973227_1092808_6202715_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40175_1459958070770_1587973227_1092804_7671771_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40175_1459957590758_1587973227_1092792_2927837_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40604_1459898829289_1587973227_1092496_637592_n.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss144/tareen/Floods/40175_1459957230749_1587973227_1092783_7920665_n.jpg[/img]\n\n\nMay Allah ease what is upon us.

What is your opinion of the 7x64 Brenneke?[/quote]\n\nA most wonderful German Cartridge which was popular long before the 7mm rem mag in Europe. It is slightly slower than the 7mm Rem Magnum but has a great edge over the 270.\nThe 7 x 64 Brennake  is considered to damage less meat in a game animal while dispatching it as efficiently as the 7mm Rem Mag. This is the opinion held by big game hunters in Europe. The Rem is very slightly flatter in trajectory[/quote]\n\n\nWith that said Col. Sahab, how would you compare the 30-06 to the 7x64 Brenneke, in the Pakistani context? Assuming that either was the only calibre one had to shoot with and if one could get only the 150gr. or the 165gr. bullet in the 30-06, and the 140 gr. bullet in the 7x64, and one wants to shoot wildboar, gazelle, blackbuck, hogdeer, ibex, urial, nilgai, and perhaps markhor as well. \n\nWhich calibre would you prefer and why?[/quote]\n\nAt Par. I would personnally  prefer an 30-06 because you chose the 165 bullet. If you choose the 160 for the 7x64 then I am with the 7x64.

At that time, my grandmother was just looking through her closet while my dad and I would remove an AK from the suitcase, remove the mag, make sure it was clear, and then put it in another box to clean later. My dad would check each weapon by just removing the magazine, racking the bolt and moving to the next. I would remove the mag, rack the charging handle visually and physically (with my pinky finger) inspect the chamber and then move on to the next AK-all of this while pointing the gun in a safe direction. I told my dad to do as I did but he was in a hurry and said it took too much time the way I did. He also said,[i] tum to bache ho, mujhae zaida patha hai[/i] Then on his last weapon he removed the mag, racked the bolt and pulled the trigger *BANG*!! the gun went off! the 7.62 by 39mm FMJ armour piercing round narrowly (by about 4.5 inches) missed my grandmother! My father had not looked to see whether or not the chamber was loaded.

[/quote]\n\nThat is what the point is. An average shooter would normally hit the bullets in an area of 4-8 inches from 15 M in routine range practice. In a tense situation when the heartbeat is high, this may increase to anything like 8-12 inches very easily. Now say a person has been practicing with standard 115 grain FMJ and normally shoots around the bull in a 4-8 inches area. As seen in the tests, there is a difference of 4-6 inches in the MPI formed by JHPs and  FMJs from 20 M. Now add up everything, ie, A person hitting in tense situation (8-12 inches) + 4-6 inches of difference between MPI of FMJ and JHP. It comes to something like 12-18 inches. There are chances that a person might even miss the torso. \n\nFrom this I conclude that whatever ammo one carries for self defence must be the one with which he normally practices. The habit of practicing with low velocity FMJs  on the range and carrying a high potency JHP for self defence may prove to be a dangerous habit.

Thanks everyone, specially Skeeter60 sahib  :) \n\n\nThough off the topic, I would like to mention about the bullet drop in pistols. Today, I shot my MP446 Viking at 100 M and noticed a bullet drop of little more than 2 ft approx. I fired 10 bullets on a target,  aiming on top of the head (the target resembled a human figure). All 10 bullet hit on the target in the belly area in a spread of around 18 inches.  Would measure the bullet drops at 75 and 50 Ms also. This gives me confidence that a target can be engaged at 100 M with reasonable accuracy, if one is mindful of the bullet drop at that range from his handgun. I am sure the data would drastically differ from handgun to handgun. Many handguns may not have the capability to hit a target at 100 M, come what may :)\n\nSorry again for being off the topic   :)', 0, 1, '203.128.255.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5555, 154401),

Shariq sb tried her out recently and everyone who has ever tested her, has been impressed, not only by her looks and bulid but also by her performance. I havent conducted a particular GUN ACCURACY test on it, but you check out the range performance in the marksmanship thread in the club house section. Overall its a nice weapon, is very reliable. I have also had a chance of firing the Girsan Regard, that is made like beretta 92, again a very reliable weapon, havent had any FTF or FTEs on that also.

[/quote]\n\nThat is what the point is. An average shooter would normally hit the bullets in an area of 4-8 inches from 15 M in routine range practice. In a tense situation when the heartbeat is high, this may increase to anything like 8-12 inches very easily. Now say a person has been practicing with standard 115 grain FMJ and normally shoots around the bull in a 4-8 inches area. As seen in the tests, there is a difference of 4-6 inches in the MPI formed by JHPs and  FMJs from 20 M. Now add up everything, ie, A person hitting in tense situation (8-12 inches) + 4-6 inches of difference between MPI of FMJ and JHP. It comes to something like 12-18 inches. There are chances that a person might even miss the torso. \n\n[b]From this I conclude that whatever ammo one carries for self defence must be the one with which he normally practices[/b]. The habit of practicing with low velocity FMJs  on the range and carrying a high potency JHP for self defence may prove to be a dangerous habit.

How do you store yours?[/quote]\n\nAoA\n\nthe manufacturer recommending that blued weapons should not be stored in air tight containers is right. what happens is that you run serious risk of locking moisture inside that air tight container as well which will eventually migrate to metal surfaces cause them to rust.\n\nIf u''r gonna air tight a firearm, the best way to ensure a rust free environment is that you store something to take care of that moisture too. Silica gel is a good solution. make sure to store plenty of it (activated).\n\nanother but slightly technical solution would be to vacuum seal it in a thick plastic bag. no air, no moisture, no rust. you can also throw in a couple of Silica gel pouches just to be double sure.\n\nanother solution would be to throw in a couple of VCI tablets. these is new age stuff. these invisible vapors act just like a lubricant film and cover the metal parts inside out, completely protecting the metal from any sort of rusting or discoloration. no need of vacuum sealing with this technology. you can use any air tight container.\n\nas far as lubing the firearm for extended period is concerned, i''m not a 100% on it. cause lubricants are generally bad for painted finishes and plastics (long term effects). besides, too much lubrication would necessitate a thorough cleaning at the end of the extended storage period. essentially rendering the weapon useless in the event of an emergency.\n\nthe best and easiet in my view would be to order a couple of VCI rust tabs from brownells or any Internet site and throw them in there with the firearm in an air tight container. \n\nVCI plastic bag is also a good option. just put the firearm in a VCI bag and forget it. the bag''s material is made from such a material that gives off VCI vapors.\n\nI hope it helps.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '115.186.174.67', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5598, 154684),

Since a Camry is priced three times as high a Corolla, does it offer three times as many wheels?\n2. does it offer three times as much seating capacity?\n3. does it offer three times as much horse power?\n4. does it offer three times as much?\n\nAnswer:\n\nObviously Not. but the debate doesnt end here. \n\nnow kindly answer this:\n\n1. which one is more comfortable\n2. which one is more classy\n3. which one offers more spacious compartment\n4. which one offers more horsepower\n\nAnswer: ofcourse a Camry is far better car than any Corolla at any given day.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nCorolla is a basic luxury car whereas a Camry is a more souped up version of that same basic luxury car concept. if you believe that the added luxury being offered by a Camry is worth its price then you should buy a Camry and if you believe that the added luxury is not worth it then you should stick to a Corolla.\n\nAnyways, i''m just horsing around. and to be honest, the easiest explanation would be that Baikal Shotguns offer everything that a basic shotgun should. whereas berettas and brownings offer added luxuries but for that you must pay a hefty price. it doesn''t end here as well. there are other shotgun brands out there that make berettas and brownings look like cheap knockoffs but inorder to buy those you''ll have to pay pretty large sums of money. something in the ball park of buying a house.\n\nRemember:\n\none extra unit of luxury is always expensive than the last unit of luxury. so more luxuries you add, you end up increasing the price exponentially.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\n!@ Gauge a very comprehensive answer and just the right one for those who are not into serious competitive  shooting.', 0, 1, '110.36.28.115', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 4667, 154722),

We all know that CZ is a Sig P226 clone, which is a proven design. \n\nViking has been produced after years of research by Russian engineers and is a top performer in all respects. I don''t know how you found Viking metallurgy as poor. In my view, metallurgy has always been a top point of all Russian weapons and so is the case with Viking. All metal parts in Viking are made of forged steel. The guide rod that you find poorly made is made of forged steel as well and has been designed to take very high load / pressures. The quality of guide rod spring is also top class. As regards the breach and chamber, I find them amongst the strongest build of all the handguns that I have seen so far and have been designed to take more pressure than any other known handgun in the world in 9x19 caliber. (unlike the belief of few members that the chamber and barrel of Viking is of inferior quality from Grach which has been designed to fire 7N21 and 7N31, I find no difference in the barrel of both). Perhaps you have been influenced by the poor finish on various metal parts. Well, that actually does not effect the performance and has something to do with aesthetics. Russians have always been known for saving money on final finish but not on the strength, ruggedness and durability of the weapon parts. \n\nViking has better sights than a CZ and is more convenient to shoot in rapid fire situation. This is my opinion after firing thousands of rounds from both these handguns. Viking certainly has a better trigger, no doubt about it. It''s the quality that one normally finds in match pistols. Crisp and accurate. And the magazine is also quite solidly built in my view. Even the follower is metallic (in case of CZ its made of plastic). Viking is certainly lighter and easier to carry, even with 18 rounds in the magazine. \n\nThe other day I tested Viking at 100 M. Frankly, I was not expecting to hit anything on the target (which was of the shape of a man torso) but was able to achieve accurate hits and all ten bullets were on the target in an area of around 2 feet. What more one can demand from a handgun  :) With this said, I found CZ comparatively more accurate at shorter ranges. \n\nIMHO, both CZ and Viking are top handguns and one cant go wrong with anyone of them.

I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\n\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\n\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nCZ 999 Scorpion\n\na time proven design that has faced the most critique consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\n\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\n\nthe barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside. some say it is a sign of durability, I''ll say not necessarily. but I would rather have inside out chroming instead of only inside chroming. both barrels are hammer forged by the way.\n\nthe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking. I do not what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\n\nwhen it comes to handguns, barrel isnt everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel inserts. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. I would say, that it is weak but I will say that Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\n\nnow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. but thats not the end of it. there are other controls too, CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\n\nBottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):\n\nDurability: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10 (since it incorporates a better barrel)\nReliability: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nControls: Baikal = 8/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nTrigger: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10\nComfort: Baikal = 6/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nAccuracy: Baikal = 8/10 and CZ 999 9/10 (from Gilani Sb''s tests)\nWeight: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10 (slightly heavy)\nField Stripping: Baikal 8/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nmaintenance: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 5/10 (aluminum frame is high maintenance)\nmag capacity: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 9/10 (I do not see a tactical disadvantage)\n[b][color=red]****ease of finding or making accessories/parts: Baikal 0/10 and CZ 999 10/10****[/color][/b]\nBalance and Point-ability: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nAverage Score: Baikal 8.25/10 and CZ 999 Scorpion 8.85/10 (CZ 999 wins only by a slight margin, totally negligible and inconclusive in my opinion)\n\nExplanation:\n\nin my view, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion which (possibly but not necessarily) compromises on durability takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters. I''m not saying that durability doesn''t. all I''m saying when I go to a store to buy a pair of boots, I buy the ones that are strong and comfy. why don''t I go and buy something made of all metal/steel? strong as hell but would rip my feet to shreds. so why should firearms be any different. any tool that we buy should be strong and comfortable as well. strength isn''t everything. otherwise we would all be wearing pants made of HDPE and boots made of fiber reinforced polymer or carbon steel instead of leather. a firearm is a complete package. you just cannot/should not focus on any two/three variables and forget the rest.\n\nhowever, your mileage may vary. this is just my personal opinion. if you desire durability to a point that comfort isn''t a necessary trait for you then by all means, Baikal is the way to go. there is no doubt about it. from durability standpoint, it is better than any CZ 999 at any given day. however if you desire a more complete package, CZ 999 offers alot more than just durability so do look into it.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. @Gilani Sb. I hope the change made to the red color line addresses any reservations that you might have. what I meant to say that (in my humble and personal opinion) you can do alot more with CZ 999 than what you could do with Baikal. from customization standpoint, adjustable sights can be bought (with baikal, no way possible unless one is blessed with a "Russian Connection"). with CZ 999 recoil guide rods/spring, hammer spring, spurred/target hammer and slide lock spring (actually its a wire) can be changed with standard PIG P226. therefore from repair standpoint, CZ999 offers alot more than Baikal. so, given the two, I feel CZ 999 Scorpion is a better handgun (just my humble opinion, i''m not suggesting anything with absolute certainty and with full knowledge that esteemed members are welcome to reject my sentiments.)', 0, 1, '124.109.59.216', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 5516, 154839),

I''ll say, guides rods are not designed to take enormous amounts of pressure to begin with therefore there is no need for a heavy, solid metal guide rod. on the other hand, Baikal''s guide rod is designed (IMHO) in such a way to reduce the chances of spring buckling under load during cycling, possibly increasing reliability. which is a big time plus in my books.\n\nmoving on, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. no need to discuss it any further.\n\nmoving on again, Baikal''s chamber clearly speaks that its designed to fire something NASTY. barrel on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nCZ 999 Scorpion\n\na time proven design that has faced the most critique consumers and lived to tell the tale, The U.S. consumers.\n\na design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest of any tests. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned.\n\nthe barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside. some say it is a sign of durability, I''ll say not necessarily. but I would rather have inside out chroming instead of only inside chroming. both barrels are hammer forged by the way.\n\nthe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is deep and more profound than on Viking. I do not what that means but I would rather have deep rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\n\nwhen it comes to handguns, barrel isnt everything. frames are a big variable as well. Baikal''s frame is polymer reinforced with steel inserts. so its steel on steel whereas on CZ 999 Scorpion, it is Steel slide on aluminum frame. I would say, that it is weak but I will say that Steel on Steel will always be better than Steel on Aluminum. plus Polymer is maintenance free, where Aluminum is high maintenance.\n\nnow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class. but thats not the end of it. there are other controls too, CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, slide release and magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\n\nBottom Line (just my humble opinion, I''m not insisting on anything):\n\nDurability: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10 (since it incorporates a better barrel)\nReliability: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nControls: Baikal = 8/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nTrigger: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10\nComfort: Baikal = 6/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nAccuracy: Baikal = 8/10 and CZ 999 9/10 (from Gilani Sb''s tests)\nWeight: Baikal = 10/10 and CZ 999 8/10 (slightly heavy)\nField Stripping: Baikal 8/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nmaintenance: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 5/10 (aluminum frame is high maintenance)\nmag capacity: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 9/10 (I do not see a tactical disadvantage)\nease of making more magazines yourself: Baikal 0/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nBalance and Point-ability: Baikal 10/10 and CZ 999 10/10\nAverage Score: Baikal 8.25/10 and CZ 999 Scorpion 8.85/10 (CZ 999 wins only by a slight margin, totally negligible and inconclusive in my opinion)\n\nExplanation:\n\nin my view, Baikal is all about durability whereas CZ 999 scorpion which (possibly but not necessarily) compromises on durability takes into consideration comfort as well. in my opinion, comfort and smoothness matters.
