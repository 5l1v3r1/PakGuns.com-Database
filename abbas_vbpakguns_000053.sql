Camping next to your vehicle?\nWhat is the intended duration  and purpose of camping out?\nThe answers to these questions are a must before I can be of any help. For back packing up in the northern areas a 2 or three men tent which weighs around 2.2 KG is required, it should be fire retardent and breathable ,otherwise your life would be miserable as water from your own bodies and clothing will condense on the inner roof and drip on you all night, you will be wet and cold. For temperatures lower than 5 degrees C you have to get a breath able Gore tex inner tent, these are available abroad or at the Expedition shops in Gilgit and Skardu, these are very expansive abroad but mountaineers sell or gift these to the porters and you can buy one from 10 to 20000/-.\nFor higher temperatures ordinary parachute cloth tents are ok but come wet weather the moisture inside will be too much to breath and every thing will get wet from the moisture given off by the body.\nAgain these parachute type tents must have a porous inner with (Jali ) type large patches to let moisture go away. \nAll tents are highly INFLAMMABLE and a lot of dangerous accidents take place due to negligence. In any case fires are lit around camps and some of our brothers are unfortunately suffering from the smoking habbit.\nCanvas tents are only good for camping next to the vehicle as these are heavy.\n The breathable Gore tex tents become warm with body heat as it lets out all the moisture but traps hot air and makes you comfortable. An insect proof mesh is a must and one can regulate temperature by opening or closing zippers. The floor should be sturdy but not heavy and the poles are flexible carbon fiber or kevlar re enforced, the pegs are plastic for use in snow and aluminum for soft ground.\nVango, Northface, Karrimor and numerous other companies specialise in very expansive but fantastic tents worth their weight in gold in the wilderness when it rains and snows and the temperatures get as low minus 40 degrees celsius.\nIn hot weather one requires shade, insect proof mesh and not much more.

To overcome this you need to use an aid to hold steady - such as ''shooting sticks''. Generally speaking 7-8.5 magnification covers just about most field/hunting use, unless you are out on the plains/in the mountains. An important point to remember is that you may be able to see quarry/a target a long way off but can you place your bullet on it without wounding or capable of making up ground/stalking nearer........\n\nI use Swarovski 7x42SL binos and will be getting a back-up Zeiss/Swarovski in 10x soon.\n\nAn important fact to note in any optical equipment is the quality of the glass and the coatings on the lenses - in quality optics (both scopes and binos) these will ensure that there is no ''flaring'' or optical issues when you look through them. Cheaper optics (Chinese/Phillipino/Taiwan etc) can only compromise.\n\nAs the saying goes ''buy once and cry once''.\n\nFinally, it is a good idea to match the quality of any scope with your binos - no good seeing a target through the binos and not as clear or clearer when you come into the aim.', 1, 0, '217.137.122.206', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

No dispute over any point except regarding few.\n\nIt will not cost 3.5 Million, even if imported and taxes / duties are paid.

I have already received 4 tax-free Arms'' licences by commerce Ministry issued for four privileged persons. As far as ban issue is concerned a renowned Gun-Dealer / Importer (who is importing) has told me that I have to pay 4500 US$ extra (nothing if I still get a Tax-Free .50) for importing it, by third country. The one option is that a person could also import himself directly if he//she is in the country of purchase after 3 formalities to come-up with there.

It is made out of carbon steel with plastic grips. It is fitted with a manual safety and when the last shot has been fired the slide is retained open by the empty magazine. The magazine capacity is 8 rounds. As this pistol was built for the Italian army, all parts were interchangeable, which simplified maintenance and manufacturing: a first at the time.\nThe M1935 was purpose built and designed for the Italian armed forces, however it was also sold to the civilian market and issued to the German forces in 1944 and 1945.\nFitted with the Beretta style open slide, the M1935 has a very reliable feeding and extraction cycle. It was made with few parts and is very simple to maintain. The M1935 is a very robust construction with long service life if properly maintained.\nThe Beretta M1935 was captured in huge numbers during World War II from Italian and German armed forces by allied soldiers, who liked it because of its small size, rugged design and good construction.

Bullet is inside barrel when firing pin strikes the primer. Barrels are made of steel, so far. So assuming that a steel frame may be strong enough to take the beating is invalid. However, rest of the pistol being polymer or steel does make some difference. Depending of the magnitude of explosion taking place, pieces of steel pistol will be much more deadlier than a polymer. Make no mistake, that polymer is safer, it would not. It may be somewhat less damaging due to its being more brittle than steel in this situation.\n\nReloading is not illegal, people are doing it for a very long time, in fact I learned it from my grand father long time ago.

Also MashAllah our forum has grown and is growing quite a bit with about a 1000 new posts every 3 days. \n\nOur mods are doing such a great job that I don''t have to step in at all but I have noticed one issue that I must address.\n\nIt is a matter of personal pride to me that PakGuns is said to be one of the most polite & friendly gun forums online. Our brotherly culture is so important to us that we''ve mentioned it repeatedly in our rules and at the sign up page. \n\nSome new friends and a few older ones at times forget this. I have instructed the mods to be extremely strict on rude behavior at our forum.\n\nTo avoid any inconvenience Please [U][B]DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING[/B][/U]: \n\n1). [B]Being rude to fellow members[/B], [B][U]specially the mods[/U][/B] as they take time out from their busy lives to help run this forum. Being rude to them will not be tolerated and I will personally ban anyone who does not understand this.\n\n2). [B]Not respecting others opinions[/B]. Everyone has a right to offer their opinion regardless of how smart / foolish it is. Making fun of them is foolish as everyone''s knowledge is limited and we all learn as we go along.\n\n3). [B]Constant complaining[/B]. We have some "Shikati Tatu''s" at our forum who apparently have nothing better to do with their lives than sending emails to mods/admin complaining about other members all day. Please grow up, this is not kinder garden, it is a forum for mature individuals. If you can''t get along with everyone then perhaps this is not the the place for you.\n\n4). [B]Ganging up on Members[/B]. We have noticed that some friends try to make a group and gang up on otjers. The standard way is one member makes a post and regardless of how good/bad it is and his chum goes "Wah Wah Sir, Kaya Baat hai" or "+10" or "Tusi paida hokay saday teh isaan kitay" etc. These guys then gang up and ridicule anyone that offers a different opinion. \n\nIt''s amusing as we have seen it all before in the past. People like these are eventually kicked out of our forum. \n\nAlthough these things are not wide spread and just a few individuals, I am posting this thread to nip this in the bud. InshAllah, PakGuns will always be an open and friendly forum for everyone and all have the right to ask any relevant question or offer a suggestion regardless of how basic/complicated it is.\n\nRegards,[/QUOTE]\n\n Very well, Abbas brother, I would say that you have raised the issue as a very impartial verdict by a reputable Judge / Justice.

Later, in 1770 British Indian adopted the word sniper. Kill With single shot.  The word applied to sharp shooter. Even before British rule In India, Great Emperor Jalal-udin Muhammad Akbar shot the Rajpoot commander during the siege of a fort in Panipat. Akaber could not breach the the fort. Altitude  of the fort was high and Akaber was stood below; just with single shot, Akbar won the battle. Churchill was hit by an Afradi sniper. The ball nicked his ear. Later Churchill wrote in his Biography that if that sniper bullet was half an inch to the right; their would had not been a Prime Minister called Winston Churchill of England. Then he  requested to be transferred to South Africa during the Boer War where he was arrested but escaped.. \r\n	Sniper are great marksman with the rifle . In WW1, British  used snipers. They were mostly the hunters. Later German used the snipers. German used Gwere Mauser 98. They were excellent. British were surprised how German can approach so closely and  kill their officers. British used 194 Enfield or Lee Enfield rifle. Later British used powerful rifles such as 375 and 458 because, German soldiers crawled behind a thick steel plate which Enfield could not penetrate. These rifles were loaned by Big Game British Hunter mostly from India.\r\n	In WII Russians were the best. especially the women. Russia trained 28000 women. One of the great marks women was Rosa Shinana . She used 189/30 Misn Naqgnat. Her confirmed kill were 500 Germans. When she killed a German commander at 1900 meters, she received the highest medal by the hand of Stalin himself. Russian were the first who issued rifle scopes. German used Zeiss 4x39 scopes later.\r\n	In 1975, during the Viet Nam war, I was drafted at the age of 23 years under the law called “Draft Bill” which is now abolished. Many young Americans fled to other countries not to be drafted. Americans actually against the wars. Only Congress can authorize the Commander in Chief, the president of USA; if the war is justified. But, President can authorize what is called police actions. It means only limited war and for short period of time and only limited military actions by small forces. Congress had authorized three wars: WWI, WII, and Desert storm. Iraq and Vietnam are not full fledge wars; these are called mission or police actions by the President.\r\n	I was not fit for anything but military saw in me good marksmanship with rifle. I am lousy with pistol but quiet good with rifle and shot guns. Therefore US army sent me to sniper school with promise to send me to any college free after I finish 2 years duty.  Fortunately, Viet Nam war ended in 1975 and I requested to be discharged while army keeps its promise. I went to college graduated with BA and MA then medical school. I am now Neuro Psychiatrist. I can treat neurological disorders as well as Psychiatric problem along with General medicine. It took me eleven yaers to finish and I used to study 16 hours a day. I still have to go to either seminar or school of medicine for three days every year to keep up the current knowledge. \r\n	Snipers are silent killers, they are master of hiding, wear ghille suits but their fatality rate is almost 80%. Because they are the most dangerous soldiers. Only lucky one come back alive.\r\n	Modern snipers has other mission too. Reconnaissance, signal, direct the artillery and the Air force. Usually each company has it. There are two snipers, they take turns. The other one direct his buddy, the distance, wind speed, ambient, the target and communication.

Secondly, each Member parliament and APUG officer are allowed / previlleged to import one tax-free weapon. I have made myself three times sure and have confirmed several times about .50 stands NPB.

With this order, the Hand Ejector Model 1889 became known as the .38 Military and Police model of 1899.[3] That same year, in response to reports from military sources serving in the Philippines on the relative ineffectiveness of the .38 (Long Colt) cartridge, Smith & Wesson began offering the Military & Police in a new chambering, the .38 S&W Special (aka .38 Special) &#8212; a slightly elongated version of the .38 Long Colt cartridge with increased bullet weight (158 grains) and increase in powder charge from eighteen to twenty-one grains of black powder.[3]\n \nIn 1902 the .38 Military & Police (2nd Model) was introduced, featuring substantial changes.[1] These included major modification and simplification of the internal lockwork and the addition of a locking underlug on the barrel to engage the previously free-standing ejector rod. Barrel lengths were 4, 5, 6, and 6.5 inches with a rounded butt. Serial numbers for the Military & Police ranged from number 1 in the series to 20,975. Most of the early M&P revolvers chambered in .38 Special appear to have been sold to the civilian market.[3] By 1904, S&W was offering the .38 M&P with rounded or square butt, and 4, 5, and 6.5-inch barrels.\n \nThe .38 S&W Military & Police Model of 1905 (4th Change, introduced 1915) incorporated a passive hammer block and enlarged service sights that quickly became a standard across the service revolver segment of the industry. Heat treatment of cylinders began in 1919.[4]\n\nAfter World War II, Smith and Wesson returned to manufacturing the M&P series. Along with cosmetic changes and replacement of the frame fitting grip with the Magna stocks, the spring-loaded hammer block safety gave way to a cam-actuated hammer block that rode in a channel in the side plate (Smith 1968). In 1957, Smith and Wesson adopted the convention of using numeric designations to distinguish their various models of handguns, and the M&P was renamed the Model 10.\n \nThe M&P/Model 10 has been available in both blued steel finish and nickel finish for most of its production run. The model has also been offered throughout the years with both the round butt and square butt (i.e. grip patterns). Beginning with the Model 10-5 series in the late 1960s, the tapered barrel and its trademark ''half moon'' front sight (as shown in the illustrations on this page) were replaced by a straight bull barrel and a sloped milled ramp front sight. Late model Model 10s are capable of handling any .38 Special cartridge produced today up to and including +P+ rounds. You can identify this late model by the implementation of a five screw assembly, four screws along the side and one in front of the trigger guard.\n \nAs of 2007 the Model 10 was available only in a 4" (102mm) barrel model. The Model 10''s stainless steel (Inox) counterpart, the Smith & Wesson Model 64, is available in either a 4" (102 mm) or a 3" (76 mm) barrel.', 1, 1, '175.110.72.168', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Plus after firing 50-100 rounds, we field stripped and it was a horrible sight of cheap visiable parts. Everybody seemed to agree on this aspect. The whole assembly was a scary sight.

The\r\nFollowing assets will have a "Not Penetrable" property added to them in the Unreal Editor:\r\n• Individual BSP faces\r\n• StaticMeshActor\r\n• Material\r\nBullet Penetration Rules\r\nEvery material has two attributes: Damage Reduction and Deviation. Damage Reduction reduces the\r\ndamage a bullet does per inch of material it passes through. Deviation determines how much the bullet\r\nchanges direction per inch of material it passes through. These effects are determined by the total\r\nthickness of the material.\r\nWhen a bullet impacts a material, the thickness of the material will be determined. The damage reduction\r\nbased on material thickness is applied to the bullet. If the bullet can still do damage, then it will penetrate\r\nthe material. When the bullet exits the material, the deviation is applied to the bullet’s direction to\r\ndetermine its new path. A round will not penetrate any item that is over 15 inches (20 Unreal Units) thick\r\nand will not penetrate more than three surfaces regardless of material type and thickness.\r\nExamples with 5.56mm Round:\r\n• 1 inch Dense Metal door: by default, the round will not penetrate the material.\r\n• 4 inches of concrete/brick: damage reduced by 120%, does not penetrate, no deviation\r\n• 2 inch hard wood door: damage reduced by 10%, deviates 10 - 14 degrees.\r\n• 2 inch Drywall on each side: damage reduced by 4%, deviates 2 - 6 degrees\r\nRicochet Mechanics\r\nEach individual bullet has 15% chance to ricochet off dense metal, mud brick, stone/ceramic tile, and\r\nconcrete/brick. The base ricochet angle is the opposite angle of impact. The final ricochet angle is a\r\nrandom angle anywhere within that angle of impact in both Y and Z dimensions.

The military (USA) prescribed either hammer down on an empty  chamber (Condition 3), or loaded, cocked and locked (Condition 1).  Carrying over a live round with hammer on half cock bypasses TWO  safeties, since there isn''t another hammer safety and the thumb safety  can''t be activated when the hammer is on half cock.\n\nThe ''half-cocked'' position of the hammer on the 1911(and ANY other  auto-loader) is there for ONE purpose ONLY, to catch the hammer and  prevent it from discharging the chambered cartridge in case the hammer  slips.It is not meant for extended use.', 1, 1, '182.185.10.25', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Can your gun fire from hammer down position?\n\n2.nd, if you''re not comfortable with a round in the chamber, you can always carry it the traditional way, uncocked/unchambered. But when there''s a round inside the chamber of a 1911, it''s ideal carry mode is [I]cocked n'' locked[/I].\n\nIn the absence of a decocking option, one has to be very careful with the high sprung hammer, short travel trigger of a 1911, when making the hammer come down with resistance force.\n\nI''d say, the 1911 handgun is probably the safest weapon to be carried loaded chamber, as long as the carrier is proficient with guns.

There''s nothing new here or any cause of new[I] jubilation.[/I]\n\n I personally observed this on using a CZ 999 in Haripur, belonging to brother of Syed Adeel bro and I was amazed at my own shots in rapid fire, making almost a scar like group, as if cut out with a razor.\n\nNow to barrel lengths. Course, it affects. As far as CZ Rami is concerned, it''s CZ''s unique twist rate playing the effect, as I recall some senior respectable''s comments somewhere in our threads. (Don''t hang me up on this, but there''s something on these lines deduced.)\n\nFinally, though I really enjoyed this event of yours, I''m humbly of the opinion that we''re comparing [I]apples to oranges.\n[/I]\n[B]1.st of all the trigger mechanism.[/B] [I]Results would have been more comparable if CZ 999 - in the the slow fire mode - had been fired with a half-cocked trigger (Don''t know if this is possible with a CZ 999). That would have brought it to the 1.5X action, roughly, like the Caracal''s 4 lbs trigger.[/I]\n\n[B]2.nd. The weight of the handgun[/B].[I] I believe we have a difference of at least 200 grams.[/I]\n\n[B]3.rd. As mentioned, the barrel lenghts[/B]. [COLOR=#ff0000][B][I](I hope next comparison would be vs a Baby Glock, to rule out the relevancy of barrel lenghts with respect to accuracy, lolz)[/I][/B]\n[/COLOR]\n[B]4.th. Steel vs Polymer.[/B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]5.th. Combat weapon vs CC SD weapon.[/B][/COLOR] [I]One is an adopted weapon in use by Serb forces, other is meant for concealed carry SD/Duty use.[/I]\n\nYou can''t carry a heavy, bulky, full sized forces weapon like the CZ 999 for your daily SD carry with any any ease, especially not with our national attire, so hence these guns serve completely different purposes.\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B]Therefore, as you can see, the only common thing between these two guns happens to be that they were GUNS. Just like apples and oranges are FRUITS, lolz![/B]\n[/COLOR]\nAs far as Caracal''s shots are concerned, it seems Ameer bro needs some  tuning in to the Safe Action trigger pull, as I''m sure he''s more used to DA/SA handguns. Shots are landing on the upward scale. Still, the shots  are enough to eliminate any threat from 15 mtrs with a CC weapon. The shots from the CZ 999 are outright awesome.\n\nAs regards the 2 misfires, well, with my Sarsilamaz Kilinc 2000 L, this ammo (Polytech-Chinese blue box) gave me a couple of  misfires too, but were shot out on 2.nd attempt. I agree therefore with 12G bro''s assertion that it''s an[I] isolated incident[/I], till Ameer bro reports more on the use of other ammo.\n\nThe lower bore axis is not supposed to be the solution to all the world''s problems.\n\nThanks again for a wonderful share.\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.17.2', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You know tall men are very prone to a cut from below, hahahaha!\n\nAnyhow, jokes aside, I''ll spare my crucial weapon for another occasion, so let''s wink off from here and enjoy the shots by both outclass weapons from each segment.\n\nLet me just be brief with a couple of comments, however. I agree fully with Mitho bro that with SD CC weapons, you do compromise a bit of accuracy for the better concealment, carry ease. Rest is customization to the Safe Action trigger, which Ameer bro proved well in his second shoot.\n\nI''m also of the opinion (Don''t hang me up, but it''s just my feeling) that 12G bro managed talking Ameer bro into the 15 mtrs range, knowing well the CZ''s benefit here. Call it kind of "match fixing", hahahaha! Caracal as SD weapon and for break-in should have been used from 10 mtrs, ideally.\n\nLet me also just state that economy is not all when choosing a handgun. 12G bro is gradually moving more towards being an economist than a gunner when he feels that target prints and accuracy should be directly proportional to amount invested. There are other considerations involved when selecting a handgun. Hence, I deem the mention of Sarsilmaz Kilin, etc, by 12G bro as totally irrelevant here. I was merely passing on comments with respect to the Chinese ammo.\n\nAs for the lower bore axis, well, on the overall plane, it may contribute only to 5-10% less recoil, better accuracy, and nobody ever said it was cutting edge technology.\n\nFinally, let me just use the opportunity to please respected 12G bro, that I''ve always liked the CZ 999 as a rugged, tough, durable and wonderful weapon in the budget range, but have issues with it''s carry ease and bulk grip. Maybe if he preached a bit less about it being the worlds finest handgun and took off his excessive "rowdiness" in getting it involved in every fight and on every avenue, I might one day consider one for the glove box of my car, hahahaha!\n\n\n\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.177.34.35', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

No malfunction occurred during test. We Had two same TT''s one with compensator and other without it. The reason we wanted to take a keen look at the pressure release of TT with compensator or without compensator.\n\nAccording to my seniors and national gold medalist''s Mr Billal thanks to him for joining me today and Mr Irfan Who brutally shot single hand rapid fire with tt and showed us result of compensator. \n\nI would also like to thank Abbas bhai who contributed on our request to test this invention. \n\nWell according to me the recoil reduced to 30%  as i was holding it too light but i was amazed that according to my seniors, champions and our beloved Abbas bhai recoil is reduced more than 60% wow this is amazing recoil killer machine. :P .\n\nI am so happy it didn''t let me down at the range. The kick i used to feel while shooting with TT its all resolved now. It''s very smooth and pressure has started to release from upper points of the compensator.

But NOWHERE its written we should believe these stupid things that are EXPLAINED by simple facts. I put my car in neutral in Karachi in MANY roads and they AUTOMATICALLY go to atleast 60km/s. I am sure If the road is long enough or steeper, the speed will be higher.\n\nI also don''t believe JALI peers who claim to fly etc etc. PEOPLE have seen (yeah rite) them fly etc etc. Nowhere do I say I don''t believe in miracles.. BUT NOT jaali miracles.\n\nA miracle would be IF WATER goes in ONE direction and the CAR in the OTHER!! But no, they both go in the same direction!\n\nIn muree, if there were no turns (hence braking), I could go faster than 200km/h\n\nI can give hundreds examples where people believed in stupid things WHICH were simple facts.

I''m sure that a quick look like that and you will not need any justifications.\n\n@to those who think that CARACAL should be tested at 10 yards\n\nwell... we can do that. if CARACAL can perform better at 10 yards then remember, Scorpion will decimate the Emarati cat at 10 yards. what? you only thought only the CARACAL is accurate at shorter distances. brothers, any POS handgun is accurate shorter distances, be it a desi clone even. I am literally shocked by your assumption that a gun which cost twice as much is only accurate at shorter distances\n\nand dont give me CC weapon crap. if that is indeed that case then I am sure RAMI should be the most inaccurate handgun out there. for those who do not know, RAMI is as accurate as any handgun can get.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nI am impressed yes that is true even desi clones do much better at 10m.

The extra 11k is worth it to me. And 15k less than Caracal is ok with me. \n\nRegards.  All credit to 12 Gauge thanks!!!', 1, 0, '119.160.8.9', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Even there are variations in 226. The German one and the US one, a second hand German 226 sells for nearly twice as much as a new 226 made in the US, these are two different guns from the inside. The Tac Ops is US made but being a 226 it is good.\n\nThe 250 is a DA only polymer gun and failed several trials in the US. A Rami beats the 250 and the 229 hands down.\nThe 228 is a great gun but the 229 is again a lemon.\nIt is a very lengthy discussion to discuss the how and why some are not so good or poor and some excellent.\n\nThe pride of my 9 mms is the Sig X6 made in Germany. The manufacturing process, the machining , extractors \nthe slides and magazines are all totally different; unknown to the unsuspecting. German made Sigs are hard to get and expansive; these are much more accurate, reliable and last a life time. The US made ones have slides made of sheet metal stampings where as the German ones are forged and the parts made by CNC lathes, the US ones have the parts shrunk fit and then brazed and held in place with a pin which needs to be replaced every 5000 rounds. The German Sigs extractor is hidden inside the slide and can be hand removed or adjusted (experts only please), the German Sig has a controlled feed and will never slip over a case rim.\nWell hope I gave you some of the differences.', 1, 1, '58.27.153.139', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Thanks. I was basically trying to say the same, just couldn''t figure out how to explain it: Head against shoulder, or shoulder against head, whatever, but my point was that there should be a "contact" here. You further reinforced the whole move with the "[B]locking[/B] of the[I] kisser [/I]there", lol!

I''m of the impression that this disturbs one''s line of sight and gives tendency for aberrations of placements, possibly more towards the upward scale, when the head is off and above shoulder, or shoulder is not pushed up against the head. Yet you should be the better one to analyze this.\n\nBtw, loved your tone, reminds me of my football coach long back, when he was trying to explain me the rule of "off-side" in soccer. He kept saying: "[I]You don''t lure the defenders and receive a pass behind their back, but you take the pass and [B]run[/B] past them[/I]", lolz!\n\nAnd you know what, I got a month or so left over here, before I start roaming the greener pastures.

Yes there are a lot of scopes in the market which can serve the purpose. But still it depends what is the purpose. Why some scopes are called of high quality and are costly and why some scopes do have similar functions but are a lot more cheap? When I research on it I find that the maximum cost involved in outdoor tours is of tour itself. Its not the gun nor the scope but people spend thousands of $ and off days to manage a trip for such hunts. In this scenario it becomes very critical that your scope must perform well in all kind of situations and low light conditions. To us all this does not matter as we usually do some target shooting or some hunting. We all know that most of scope making companies offer very good warranty services but still people select the best they can buy. Why is it so? Its all because they know that there scope will be taken care by the manufacturer but what about the cost of the tour? If they go to Alaska only three times in their life time, it is very critical that their scope should not deceive them. Now come to some of the known scope manufacturers. There are Leapers / UTG, Centre Point. Hawke. All these three are made in China even if they are original. There is no harm in made in China only if the QC is fine. But the scopes under these brands which go to US are also made in China. But Hawke is found to be best in them. Specially Hawke Airmax series is made for magnum springers.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#141823][FONT=Helvetica]But still many CPs and Leapers do well on springers. We normally feel that Hawke is very good scopes but still the US users find them to be 2nd rated when they compare Hawke to Leupold or Vortex Diamondback.\nThen come comes BSA scopes. These are fine scopes as long as they are used on light powder burners or on PCPs. But on magnum springers, these normally dont perform.\nWhat is the main feature of the scope which we should consider while purchasing a scope is that it should hold POI (zero) day in and day out.\nSo the most important thing in any scope is the ability to hold zero. You will find many Leupold basic scopes which are costly than high end Hawke, but Leupold will be costly. It will not have that much features but still costly.\nIts because the capability of holding zero is much better.\nThen comes the matter of first focal plain and 2nd focal plain. That is also important but not at this stage.

Slightly cheaper parts than vitz, No CNG problem (Although Vitz can also be fitted with CNG but by good/qualified ppl only due to its CVT transmission system). \nJap swifts are better in build quality than paki swifts and come with additional features (airbags, abs brakes, auto tranny, etc etc)\n\nBtw, both Vitz and Swift (unregistered japs) are usually trouble free and very good cars.

Methodology for the morning shoot was for the gunners to line up at the border of marsh and the lake, and intercept ducks flying over from the marsh after night feeding to the lake side for day''s rest. Later on everyone got dispersed to their respective favourite spots with their bunch of decoys and then serious gunning would ensue till 11 or 12. Most of the shots taken were between 15 to 25 yards, and my limited supply of 8s and 6s exacted a very heavy toll on unsuspecting birds at point blank range. We were so selective at that time to have avoided shooting Shovellers and Pochards while concentrating on Pintails, Mallards, Widgeons and the like. Later on we shifted to Islamabad and I bid farewell to the marshes around Lahore and Chunian after 10 years of duck hunting. Now came a switch to river shooting with its newer requirements and techniques, even though I keep visiting marshes of Mianwali etc for ducks driven over "Rassi" or rope. Notwithstanding the very successful shoots in this newer form of shooting for which now i am fully geared including trailers, boats, OBMs, rafts of decoys etc, but still sometime pangs of remorse on an almost forgotten art of marsh shooting over decoys surfaces and I wish to try out the form of hunting  I grew up on once again. the only regret is ......its not there anymore.

Will leave this to TH bro.\n\n Yet, in any case, if extra back straps later are added to any Caracal package, they''ll be of no essential value, but kind of garnish on the trunk of a car, looks good as part of the package, adds nothing essential to the functionality.\n\nNight sights will for sure be of great value.\n\nAnd now to the [B][COLOR=#ff0000]"red dot sights"[/COLOR][/B] ?

We used to shoot selected ducks over marshes, rotten paddy fields and saims in district Gujrat, Jehlum and Sialkot. There was no concept of shooting over river beds except few people who had a technique of "TULA". Whereby the experts floats in the river streams hiding them behind the rubber tube well cammo with marshes and grass. I witnessed an old shikari who retrieved 32 mallards in two shots from a double. But this technique never fascinated our team. I remember when we arranged mallard decoys from Germany in early eighties, lot of shooters were unaware about these devices. We started using these devices along with duck calls in the marshes and the results were unbelievable. Had we conceived the idea of duck shooting over river beds during those days? this would have been fantastic as the duck migration was at least 10 times better than the recent days.\nNow everything is gone. The main reason is the major decline of water flow in the rivers, availablity of guns to everyone and building of Nallas in the marshes and saims for the cultivation.

Each rifle needs its own  ''case''. The Government advice to Police Services stipulates which  calibres are suited for what - any departure requires a robust case.  Refusal of FAC application is appealed at the High  Court................Furthermore, any minor legal infringement is used  to take away the FAC and hence the firearms - seen as ''reducing  firearms''.\n3. Hunting so requires access to private land - either paid for or  through personal contact. Visitors can use an ''estate rifle'' but will  need to have this organised/paid for in advance. Your own rifle can be  brought in to the UK but will need additional paperwork/time/evidence of  booking from the person taking you out. You will need to demonstrate  ''competance and safety awareness'' with the firearm before anyone will  take you out (mandatory test with rifle on range).\n4. I also started many years ago with an air-rifle, before acquiring my FAC and first centrefire rifle.\n\nL', 1, 0, '217.137.122.206', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Please skip to the bottom if you want the verdict.\n\n\n[SIZE=200][COLOR=#0040FF]REVIEW – Daudsons Armory Semi Auto Shotgun[/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n\n\n[size=150]\n\n\nDaudsons Armory is known for making low cost shotguns. Their Security and Shooter brand of pump action shotguns provide OK value for money despite their shortcomings of low quality finish. Up til now semi auto shotguns were missing from their line up conspicuously. Recently they introduced a semi auto model based on Winchester design salient features of which I would present to you.\n \n\n\n[B][SIZE=150]BASIC SPECS[/SIZE][/B]\n\n\nGauge: 12 Gauge\nType: Gas Operated  Semi auto\nBarrel : 26 In\nBarrel Material: 4140 Chrome-Moly Steel\nMag Capacity: 4+1\nChokes: 3 flush screw-in type chokes (IC, M, F)\nFurniture: Wood \nSafety location: Behind the trigger guard\nFinish: Barrel  blue, Receiver Powder coated\nSights: brass front bead\nSlug firing Capability: Supposedly Yes\nPrice: PKR 27,000 with single barrel and wood furniture (without hard carry case). With extra  barrel ( 21 or 28 in ), complete fiber furniture and hard carry case factory price rises to 34,200 PKR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[B][SIZE=200][COLOR=#FF0000][I]REVIEW[/I][/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\n\n\n[B][SIZE=150][COLOR=#800000]Packing:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\n\n\nReviewed gun came in an elegant hard carry case. Its design is odd as it houses a assembled gun. Disassembled gun carry design would have reduced its size. Case is too big for easy storage. Case contained 03 chokes and its tool and a pistol grip which is not useful in my opinion with a 26 in barrel package. \n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02349.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n[B][SIZE=150][COLOR=#800000]Finish, Looks and Quality of Manufacturing:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\n\n\nGun looks good with wooden furniture, deep blued barrel and CNC machined receiver which is made  using imported bar stock aircraft grade aluminum alloy.  The bolt handle, bolt, cartridge elevator and trigger are finished in  chrome. The aluminum receiver is powder coated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02392.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[COLOR=#FF0000]Finish is good at some places but can be much better. Coating on receiver and barrel chips off very easily which is really annoying. These pics are of the specimen which is hardly 100 rounds used and boxed mostly but still coat has started to chip off. Similarly wood to metal fitting is poor at best and butt has developed a crack already  :angry-fire: [/COLOR]\n\n\nLook how coating is chipping off around trigger gaurd\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02363.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nA big chunk of coating has came off where bolt strikes receiver\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02364.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nNotice the crack in in the wood of stock.

Receiver is made of aircraft grade aluminum and CNC machined. Quality of machining is good but again coating can improve a lot. Bolt is also machined nicely with good chroming. Bolt sliding in receiver is smooth and speed is OK. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[B][SIZE=150][COLOR=#800000]Trigger:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\n\n\nIt has a reasonably good trigger with minor creep. \n\n   \n\n\n[B][COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150]Stock & Fore end:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]\n\n\nStock and fore end are of OK quality walnut  . Wood checkering is of fine detail but its deforming quickly  :angry-fire: . Fit and mount is OK. Butt pad provided good cushion but doesn''t look much durable.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02360.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02353.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n[B][COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150]Safety Mechanism:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]    \n\n\nIt has a button safety located just behind the trigger. It locks the trigger and is convenient to operate while shooting / hunting. [COLOR=#FF0000]Unfortunately my guns safety button is malfunctioning and does not slide to safe position[/COLOR]. Talk about reliability  :angry-fire: . Not expected out of a DSA offering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[B][COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150]Sights:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]    \n\n\nIt comes with routine brass bead front sights. Not good for low light conditions but adequate nonetheless.\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02372.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n[B][COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150]Magazine:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]    \n\n\nIt has a tubular magazine with a capacity of 4 shells (5 with one in the chamber). Don''t know of any extended Mag option.\n\n\n\n\n[COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150][B]Reliability:[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n\nIn first 100 or so rounds fired  no issues came up. Firing pin strikes are deep, defined and consistent. Extraction is quite strong. Malfunction of safety switch has dented my confidence quite a bit. I have not tested game loads as yet so can''t comment on this aspect. \n    \n\n\n[COLOR=#800000][SIZE=150][B]Maintenance:[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\n    \nCompared to a Baikal, its a very complicated gun to disassemble and re assemble. Mag tube screw cannot be opened without a tool. \n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02397.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n \n[SIZE=150][B][COLOR=#800000]Suitability for the Purpose[/COLOR]:[/B][/SIZE]\n\n\nIt is an OK gun for occasional hunt and clay shooting. I find it quite heavy and its not as balanced as an MP-153 IMO.  Its high weight and imbalance ( at least to me ) does not make it very suitable for hunting or clay shooting but its low price may make some to over look these factors.  \n     \n\n\n[B][COLOR=#FF0000][SIZE=150]Price and Value for Money[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]\n\n\nPiece of S***. Avoid at all cost. \n\n\n\n\n[SIZE=150]26-05-2011[/SIZE]\n\n\n[SIZE=150][COLOR=#FF0000]I am very sad to report a major problem with DSA Auto loader.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\nIts magazine tube  end which is threaded onto the receiver just broke. Now magazine tube is no more attached to the receiver. When I move the bolt with bolt release button then barrel and mag tube just fly out and whole gun just disassembles  :angry-fire: \n\n\n[SIZE=150]It broke from the place where mag tube is threaded on the receiver.[/SIZE]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/dsa/DSC02384.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nThis gun has hardly fired 100 rounds. Such a major failure this early is totally unacceptable.\nQuality of mag tube metal is poor. Looks downright flimsy. Threads on the other end are also in poor state. \nI am amazed how DSA quality control accepted such poor quality of a part which is under great stress. Mag end which failed is the only place which takes all the stress when bolt slams forward during firing.\nI am saddened when I say that this gun is not safe to fire till the time failed part is strengthened by DSA.\n\n\n[COLOR=#FF0000][SIZE=200]Update: Nov, 2011[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n\nAfter repair I shot down two kites with it and was happy with its performance. But then this happened!!!\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/Snapbucket/2011-11-29214329.jpg[/IMG]\n[SIZE=150]\n\n\nI  had to cut the barrel  by two inches and have been using it since then.\n\n\n[COLOR=#FF0000]Another issue.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\nNow I am experiencing Failure To Feed occasionally. No matter how much I bolt it, Cart refuses to leave the mag tube then inexplicably it starts to feed again.  Missed the second wild dog due to this failure.\nI am glad I did not sell this gun to my colleague. Poor work by DSA.\n\n\n[SIZE=150]\n[COLOR=#FF0000]Another issue.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\nIn the last 45 to 50 rounds fired, during which I have shot many kites / dogs, I experienced two failure to fire   \nI was using shahine LG rounds. I was chasing a dog during both occasions and I had to clear the FTF and go for another shot. Could not find the ejected shell later so not sure whether carts had proper pin strike or not. BTW I have never experienced a FTFire in a Shahine Cart with a clear pin strike in years of use.\nI have thoroughly cleaned the gun and I hope problem does not duplicate.\n\n\n[SIZE=150]\n[COLOR=#FF0000]Another issue.[/COLOR][/SIZE]\nOne more problem to report!!!\nYou can see in the picture that metal just broke and it needs to be welded back. \nWhat a POS product. It just refuses to work.\n[IMG]http://i542.photobucket.com/albums/gg405/sqnldr_shariq/DSC00832.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[SIZE=200][COLOR=#FF0000]FINAL VERDICT [/COLOR][/SIZE]\n\n\n[SIZE=150]A real bad buy and a lemon the size of a watermelon.

I have been using my DSA Autoloader shotgun to no ill effect and have fired countless homemade, Turkish and federal slugs from it. since I cast my own therefore never felt the need to keep a count.\r\n\r\nif you look at the picture carefully, you''ll find that the barrel was damaged from the muzzle which is an indication of barrel obstruction at the time of firing. the shooter has admitted that prior to firing the cartridge that brought this particular shotgun to this condition, he fired a weak cartridge. its only an educated guess that the weak cartridge''s wad got stuck in the barrel which caused over pressure inside the barrel when a fresh cartridge was fired afterwards.\r\n\r\nif the barrel was damaged from chamber/breech end, I would have agreed that it was defective manufacturing/design of the barrel that caused this mishap.\r\n\r\nas far as the magazine tube breaking off is concerned, I distinctly remember Shariq Bhai mentioning that he fiddled with it ignoring my advise on disassembling it yourself.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\np.s. would you feel any better if I show you a video of me firing slugs from a DSA autoloader shotgun in rapid fire more? :) I sincerely hope that my bruised shoulder could bring some form of respite.', 1, 1, '182.177.109.5', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Please help me select one of them to buy. My budget allows me to get the Stoeger Cougar and the CZ 999. But, I love the CZ 75D Compact and also CZ Duty. So, if you all suggest that I buy one of the latter two, I can increase my budget to buy one of them. \n\nIf the CZ 75D Compact was available easily and I did not have to go to Fakhr-e-Alam in Peshawar to buy it, then that would be the only option.\n\nThe CZ Duty is a polymer frame, and although I love its sexy looks, I would prefer to go for a metal frame weapon. It is only a personal preference. And also, it did not "completely" fit my hand when I held it at a gun shop. My last finger, or "pinky", was not comfortable with its grip.\n\nThe Stoeger Cougar is without doubt a very reliable weapon, but somehow, its rotating barrel is not very "comforting", because it is not conventional. I am one of the people who think that a weapon should be such that is based on conventional designs because they are tried and tested and have proven their worth. Stoeger Cougar has also proven its worth, but this is just a personal preference of wanting to go for conventional designs. By the way, I loved the grip of the Stoeger Cougar when I held it in my hands in a gun shop.\n\nThe CZ 999, Skorpion or not, I don''t know, is also a very trusted weapon as I read on this forum. Again, I do not like the feature on this pistol which allows me to switch from a revolver trigger mode to a semi-automatic pistol trigger mode, and vice versa, as I dont want "shashkay" in the firearm. This is because in the time of need, this option may hinder the functionality of my weapon, which is a NO NO. This again is why I like the conventional ways/designs in firearms. And clarify, if you please, what is the difference between the CZ 999 and the CZ 999 Skorpion and which one of these does NOT have the revolver to pistol or "R & P" option. I know this is not a firearm made by the company CZ based in Czech Republic, but by Zastava Arms, Sebia.\n\nPlease help me select one of these firearms based on your knowledge and expertise. And suggest a good IWB holster for the firearm you suggest, and its availability, also. My normal attire is kameez shalwar and I will be positioning my weapon at 9 o''clock, or on the left, positioned for a RIGHT-hand draw. This is the way I like it.\n\nP.S. This will be my first firearm.\n\nThanks in anticipation.\n\nAs-Salaam-O-Alaikom Wa Rehmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu!', 1, 0, '203.81.212.174', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Methodology for the morning shoot was for the gunners to line up at the border of marsh and the lake, and intercept ducks flying over from the marsh after night feeding to the lake side for day''s rest. Later on everyone got dispersed to their respective favourite spots with their bunch of decoys and then serious gunning would ensue till 11 or 12. Most of the shots taken were between 15 to 25 yards, and my limited supply of 8s and 6s exacted a very heavy toll on unsuspecting birds at point blank range. We were so selective at that time to have avoided shooting Shovellers and Pochards while concentrating on Pintails, Mallards, Widgeons and the like. Later on we shifted to Islamabad and I bid farewell to the marshes around Lahore and Chunian after 10 years of duck hunting. Now came a switch to river shooting with its newer requirements and techniques, even though I keep visiting marshes of Mianwali etc for ducks driven over "Rassi" or rope. Notwithstanding the very successful shoots in this newer form of shooting for which now i am fully geared including trailers, boats, OBMs, rafts of decoys etc, but still sometime pangs of remorse on an almost forgotten art of marsh shooting over decoys surfaces and I wish to try out the form of hunting I grew up on once again. the only regret is ......its not there anymore.

I just now came upon this thread - something that I overlook all the time until you mentioned Project.  Thats what caught my eye.\nFor starters Bravo, very very well done.  You have a knack for these types of things.\nNow, for some input I do hope you will NOT mind me stating as this project still CAN get even better.\n-Bushing comps - although very nice looking do NOT provide the full compensation recoil.  Reason being this: as the bullet enters the compensator - the gases follow.  As the bullet is crossing the compensator muzzle or EACH chamber there is a restriction baffle again to force the following gases to find another way out forcefully and that is via the vents.  In the muzzle bushing compensators there are less gasses being trapped as the muzzle hole of the comp is too large - it has to cycle over the barrel with the slide.  The recoil decrease which you are feeling is strictly the weight of the comp.. Also, had this comp been attached to the barrel - the slide would not have cycled as the lockup would have been weight biased... hence, many comps are now made from aluminum.  Furthermore, had this comp been designed to trap and divert gases properly you would have also needed a weaker set of recoil springs as required for proper cycling of slide.  See the attached pics below.\n\nThe multi chamber comp below is from Carver Comps, its aluminum for light wight, and gives very good compensation per chamber(s), hence it requires a 9lbs recoil spring as compared to the standard 16lbs recoil spring.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/9-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/8-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is my reverse engineered multi chamber comp for the TS, its all steel.  It too required me to retire the stock TS recoil spring and use something weaker.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-6.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/6-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is a multi chamber comp, this is part steel and part aluminum.  This is the only comp anomaly I have seen as it mounts to the frame and the barrel slides in upon lockup into the comp.. It does NOT require any alteration to the gun(s); hence very efficient to move it around from gun to gun specifically Beretta 92 (without rails)\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/4-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow having said all this we can move on to the grip.  There needs to be a recess cut where the trigger guard ends and the grip begins.  This is a critical area as it allows the hands to come up higher.  See how much you can shave off there.  Then let me know I will send you something to put on the front and rear grip strap which will make this gun want to stay in your hands and never slip.\n\nLast but not least - This is a GREAT Project Path you are on. Forget the Benson Dabbi - I myself have quit smoking (as you get older as a smoker your hands shake more). Plan on the khuwari. But remember the results that will await you in the end are going to be even more mindbogling.\n\nSoooo here are my "two bits" - I do hope I was clear in the concepts somewhat.

The 90/10 Principle Click to advance\n2. Author: Stephen Covey Discover the 90/10 Principle It will change your life (or at least, the way you react to situations)\n3. What is this Principle? 10% of life is made up of what happens to  you. &#8230; 90% of life is decided by how you react&#8230; & how you react is  YOUR decision\n4. What does this mean? We really have NO control over 10% of what happens to us.\n5. We cannot stop the car from breaking down. The plane will be late  arriving, which throws our whole schedule off. A driver may cut us off  in the traffic.\n6. We have NO control over this 10%. The other 90% is different. You determine the other 90%. How?... By your reaction.\n7. You cannot control a red light. However, you can control your  reaction. YOU can control and decide how you react. Let us use an  example&#8230;\n8. You are having breakfast with your family. Your daughter knocks over a  cup of coffee Onto your business shirt. You have no control over what  has just happened. What happens next will be determined by how you  react.\n9. You curse. You harshly scold your daughter for knocking the cup over.  She breaks down in tears. After scolding her, you turn to your wife and  you criticize her for placing the cup too close to the edge of the  table. A short verbal battle follows. You storm upstairs and change your  shirt. Back downstairs, you find your daughter has been too busy crying  to finish her breakfast and getting ready to go to school. She misses  the bus.\n10. Your spouse must leave immediately for work. You rush to the car and  drive your daughter to school. Because you are late, you drive 40 miles  per hour in a 30 mph speed limit zone.\n11. After a 15-minute delay and throwing $60.00 traffic fine away, you  arrive at school. Your daughter runs into the building without saying  goodbye. After arriving at the office 20 minute late, You realize you  forgot your briefcase. Your day has started terrible. As it continues,  it seems to get worse and worse. You look forward to coming home.\n12. When you arrive home, you find a small wedge in your relationship  with your wife and daughter. Why? Because of how you reacted in the  morning . Why did you have a bad day?\n13. A) Did the coffee cause it? B) Did your daughter cause it? C) Did  the policeman cause it? D) Did you cause it? The answer is &#8220;D&#8221;\n14. You had no control over what happened with the coffee. How you  reacted in those 5 seconds is what caused your bad day. Here is what  could have and should have happened.\n15. Coffe splashes over you. Your daughter is about to cry. You gently  say: &#8220; It&#8217;s okay, honey, you just need to be More careful next time.&#8221;  Grabbing a towel you go upstairs and change your shirt. You grab your  briefcase, and you come back down in time to look through the window and  see your child getting on the bus. She turns and waves. You arrive 5  minutes early a cheerfully greet the staff. Notice the difference?\n16. Two different scenarios. Both started the same. Both ended  different. Why? Because of how you reacted . You really have no control  over 10% of what happens in your life. The other 90% was determined by  your reaction.\n17. Here are some ways to apply the 90/10 Principle. If someone says  something negative about you, do not be a sponge. Let the attack roll  off like water on glass. You do not have to let the negative comments  affect you. React properly and it will not ruin your day. A wrong  reaction could result in losing a friend, being fired, or getting  stressed out.\n18. How do you react if someone cuts you off in the traffic? Do you lose  your temper? Pound on the steering wheel? (a friend of mine had the  steering wheel fall off) , Do you curse? Does your blood pressure  skyrocket? Who cares if you arrive 10 seconds later at work? Why give  someone else the power to ruin your drive?\n19. When you decide how you react, you decide whether the the issue is  worth undertaking the stress. Just the fact that you control the  situation and its not a forced situation will enhance your positive  energy exponentially Millions of people are suffering from undeserved  stress, trials, problems and headaches. We all must understand and apply  the 90/10 Principle. It can change your life! &#8230; Enjoy it... It only  takes willpower to give ourselves permission to make the experience.\n20.

I just now came upon this thread - something that I overlook all the time until you mentioned Project.  Thats what caught my eye.\nFor starters Bravo, very very well done.  You have a knack for these types of things.\nNow, for some input I do hope you will NOT mind me stating as this project still CAN get even better.\n-Bushing comps - although very nice looking do NOT provide the full compensation recoil.  Reason being this: as the bullet enters the compensator - the gases follow.  As the bullet is crossing the compensator muzzle or EACH chamber there is a restriction baffle again to force the following gases to find another way out forcefully and that is via the vents.  In the muzzle bushing compensators there are less gasses being trapped as the muzzle hole of the comp is too large - it has to cycle over the barrel with the slide.  The recoil decrease which you are feeling is strictly the weight of the comp.. Also, had this comp been attached to the barrel - the slide would not have cycled as the lockup would have been weight biased... hence, many comps are now made from aluminum.  Furthermore, had this comp been designed to trap and divert gases properly you would have also needed a weaker set of recoil springs as required for proper cycling of slide.  See the attached pics below.\n\nThe multi chamber comp below is from Carver Comps, its aluminum for light wight, and gives very good compensation per chamber(s), hence it requires a 9lbs recoil spring as compared to the standard 16lbs recoil spring.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/1-7.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/9-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/8-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is my reverse engineered multi chamber comp for the TS, its all steel.  It too required me to retire the stock TS recoil spring and use something weaker.\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/2-6.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/6-2.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThis is a multi chamber comp, this is part steel and part aluminum.  This is the only comp anomaly I have seen as it mounts to the frame and the barrel slides in upon lockup into the comp.. It does NOT require any alteration to the gun(s); hence very efficient to move it around from gun to gun specifically Beretta 92 (without rails)\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/4-2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/3-6.jpg[/IMG]\n\nNow having said all this we can move on to the grip.  There needs to be a recess cut where the trigger guard ends and the grip begins.  This is a critical area as it allows the hands to come up higher.  See how much you can shave off there.  Then let me know I will send you something to put on the front and rear grip strap which will make this gun want to stay in your hands and never slip.\n\nLast but not least - This is a GREAT Project Path you are on. Forget the Benson Dabbi - I myself have quit smoking (as you get older as a smoker your hands shake more). Plan on the khuwari. But remember the results that will await you in the end are going to be even more mindbogling.\n\nSoooo here are my "two bits" - I do hope I was clear in the concepts somewhat. Feel free to contact me if you like at [EMAIL="paradigms67@hotmail.com"]paradigms67@hotmail.com[/EMAIL].\n\nP.S.  Lolz, The TS is no longer called that anymore... Its now known as ANUBIS... All hail ANUBIS!  Lolz.[/QUOTE]\n\nAslamualikum Moeen Bro, \n\nThis is an absolutely great information you leaked from your extraordinary experience. I really appreciate you for being here in this thread. \nWell Moeen bro i was really impressed by your evolution project and wanted to conquer some place in this field. I like .30 Caliber and its magnum like power. I had a same vision in mind which you explained for trapping gasses more but i did not get tools and apparatus for the compensator you shared. As my current compensator is hand made. \n\nI have some pending things to work on. 1= 1.5 " long barrel which i can get it threaded from the front but how and where i don''t know :P. 2= Long Guide rod so it can be fitted in Compensator. 3= Recoil spring. etc etc. Then ready a new compensator like yours :). Lets see if i get lucky enough to avail these tools and accessories. I hope it would be definitely mind blowing for TT.\n\nThanks Moeen Bro please let me know if long guide rod helps to break recoil i want to make sure i am not wrong. \nAnd i will send you an email if any help needed :) thanks for your help', 1, 0, '182.177.188.253', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(268897, 8922, 0, 'Rizshu', 807, 'Cell Phone Snatching', 1337274489, 'The incidents of cell phone snatching at gunpoint are increasing day by day. An average of 70 to 80 cell phones are snatched and stolen in a day in Karachi alone. In most cases the perpetrators kill their victim on resistance. In many cases the perpetrator while snatching the cell phone also snatch cash and other valuables from their victims. News of cell phone snatching at gunpoint and killing the victim on resistance is now published in the newspapers almost daily. The main reason of cell phone snatching is that it can be sold in the black market little less than its cost in the open market, which ranges from Rs 1000 to Rs 100,000 depending upon its quality. Moreover it is such a small item that once snatched or stolen it can be carried by the snatcher or thief undetected. Therefore cellophanes have become an attractive item for the criminals.\n\nCell phone can be snatched from any person, anywhere and at any time where the snatcher is sure of his success and has a safe passage to escape. The people most vulnerable to cell phone snatching are those who travel alone in car, motorbike riders and pedestrians on the streets or in the busy markets. People generally don&#8217;t dare to resist with the cell phone snatcher for fear of being killed by him and give up easily. This goes in favour of the snatchers as such the crime of cell phone snatching is spreading rapidly. So far the police have not been able to prevent this crime, which is their primary responsibility. Similarly the government has also not paid any attention to this menace. The citizens have therefore started feeling insecure while carrying their cell phone.\n\nThese cell phone snatchers fall into three categories: Firstly the professional criminals who are either involved in illegal cell phone business for themselves or working for some terrorists/underground political organization as their paid agent. Secondly the opportunist criminals who may either be unemployed youths or students of school/colleges who have indulged in bad society and need money. Thirdly the drug addicts who are always in search for making the money by any unfair means. \n\nThough cell phone snatching has become inevitable but its impact on the victim can be reduced by taking certain precautions. \n\n1) Do not carry an expensive cell phone so that if at all it is snatched the loss of money spent on it will be less.\n\n2) Always carry your cell phone in a way that it is not visible to the people and put it on vibration instead of bell or buzzer so that it does not indicate presence of cell phone with you.\n\n3) Avoid attending calls on your cell phone if you are passing through or in an area suspected to be unsafe. You can however respond to the caller once you are out of that area.\n\n4) Avoid using your cell phone while traveling in the car and always keep the doors of your car locked and windows rolled up. You are most vulnerable to cell phone snatchers and robbers while stopped at an intersection.\n\n5)Do not carry more cash than it is necessary. Keep between Rs 500 to Rs 1000 in your purse and rest should be carried hidden with you in some other way so that if your purse is also snatched the entire money is not taken away.\n\n6) Do not carry more than one credit card in your purse. Keep remaining credit cards, ATM cards including their pin codes, your NIC and driving licence separately hidden with you in some way.\n\n7) If you are confronted with a cell phone snatcher/criminal remain calm and try to look confident. Do not quarrel or try to resist and let him take what he wants from you, but do not volunteer to give him anything.\n\n8) If your cell phone is snatched inform immediately the company which provided the connection to your cell phone to block the SIM and lodge an FIR with the nearest police station. Remember you can be caught and prosecuted if the police intercept conversation by a terrorist or criminal on your cell phone number.\n\nLastly the police in plain clothes should start the campaign of hunt down the cell phone snatchers in the guise of an ordinary citizen. A reward for the police personnel for catching a cell phone snatcher may also be announced by the police highups. This will prove as a great deterrence for cell phone snatchers as well as other street criminals.\n\nThe above precautions suggested can reduce the risks of cell phone snatching, save the life and minimize the loss.', 1, 1, '116.71.1.123', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Someone was shown a loaded gun whatever the reason is, mobile snatching or playing chor sipahee, but the time you hold a gun on someone the reason is , [color=red]Give this to me or I kill you![/color]. now what, he is challenging to kill you, how do we it is justified he just wanted to take my property (mobile) and leave be unhurt ? Do law allows me to attack first before I am shot ? I heard from people, and discussed many times in this forum as well, [b] if the bad-guy is armed and attack/tries to attack then you should first shot him on the leg.

I was searching for 70K gun and had PT92, Baikal, Stoeger in my mind and my heart with Taurus PT 809. I did window shop the market couple of times and when I was finalizing between Baikal and Stoeger I had the opportunity at one shop to check out CZ Duty. The grip fitted in my hand just perfectly and the slim compact look was awesome. The guy was demanding 110K final so it was just a dream for me at that time. I went for stoeger and started managing my funds to buy it. Finally got the chance to buy it at 85K and I sold my Stoeger for 55k (bought for 58K) and purchased CZ-75 P07 Duty from Peshawar. And this time my love materialized. :)\n \n[B]The impressions without firing[/B]\n \n[B][I] In and out of the Box[/I][/B], It came with two standard magz of 16, some manuals stuff and a CD, a cleaning brush. That&#8217;s it.\n \n[B][I]Safety/Decocker[/I][/B] Its with a safety however t there is an option to change the safety with decocker and as per manual its quite easy to do, even user can do it without needing help of gunsmith etc. I am fine with safety bcuz manual "decocking" is not that science and therefore "decocker" is not required badly. Though I do quite fine with manual decocking with my dad''s tees bore and with empty CZ but today when I decocked it manually with a live round, hammer got slipped and hit the firing pin from more than halfcocked position. Didn''t fire the round.\n \n[B][I]Hammer[/I][/B] is not hard. Its easy to cock and decock.  \n \n[B][I]Grip[/I][/B] is awesome. It fits in my hand as if it is made for it. Serrations on the grip make it perfect for sweaty hands. It just doesn''t slip even when hands are raining sweat.\n \n[B][I]Slide[/I][/B] is not polymer and its not black either. Its kinda greyish black. As the slide and barrel is metal that&#8217;s why when mag is empty, the gun in hand drops forward bcuz of the weight of barrel and slide. But when mag is loaded with around 10 bullets then its balanced. When the slide is locked back then barrel does not appear to be steady straight. Its kinda tilted upwards from front side. Donno why is that.\n \n[B][I]Magzines[/I][/B] are easy to load. Loading Stoeger''s mag was quite hard. But CZ Duty''s were fine however couldn''t load the 16[SUP]th[/SUP], tried twice on both the magz and then left it for some other time. Mag drops free easily. You guys will be surprised to know that Sig P226''s mag fit in, load the bullet in chamber and extracts it perfectly.\n \n[B][I]Disassembly[/I][/B] takes time, atleast its kinda difficult than Stoeger. It cud have been quite better. Guiding rod is plastic and spring is just pain in ass. It took me half an hour and still cudn''t put it back. I thought I am one big jerk to buy a handgun and can''t assemble it. Opened youtube and found everyone complaining about the spring, relieved tried again and did it on second attempt. I am now scared of disassembling it again just bcuz of that bloody spring.       \n \n[B]Had the opportunity today to visit my frnd''s village for some firing. So here are some range details.[/B]\n \n[B]Ammunition[/B]\n \n1. Chinese Brown box (11)\n2. Chinese Red box (15)\n3. WCC Nato (15)\n4. Armscor JHPs (10)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10541[/ATTACH]\n \nDidn&#8217;t have enough time so could only manage to fire 51 rounds. No problem whatsoever. No FTE, no FTF.\n \n[B]Cherry Popping[/B]\n \nThis time I thought not to deflower my handgun thru "flat nosed" ammo (Chinese :p) or "no nose" philpo ammo (Armscor JHP) so the only option left was WCC NATO and Chezh Republic''s beauty''s cherry was popped thru US''s WCC Nato rounds.\n \n[B]Performance at 10 meters[/B]\n \n5 WCC Nato rounds went first. Remained on 7 o clock from target, one was a flyer. There was a smell of burning gun powder after WCC rounds, never happened when i fired chinese rounds with stoeger.\n\n5 Chinese red box next. 3 bull''s-eye. 1 at 8 o clock near bullseye and one again far at 7 o clock. The slide didn&#8217;t lock back this time.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10542[/ATTACH]\n \n11 chinese brown box next. 2 were damn in the bullseye, and 3 were smelling the boundary, so I will say 5 were bullseye :p, 4 were at 6 o clock, 1 was at 3 o clock and one was flyer.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10543[/ATTACH]\n \n10 armscor JHPs next. 2 bullseeye, 1 was quite near so lemme say 3 bullseye :p, remaining seven managed to be on the chart, literally everywhere like cricket fielders, long thirdman, short thirdman, back on boundry at midwicket, long on and long off.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10544[/ATTACH]\n \n10 WCC Nato rounds next. Didn&#8217;t hit the target. :( one was again flyer :p ... Again that smell ... \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10545[/ATTACH]\n \nSo, 11 out of 41 bullseye, and it was my second time on target shooting with handgun. I am lovin'' it :p\n \nNow time for being a little controversial here :p\n \n[B]CZ Duty VS Caracal[/B]\n \nBeing a new learner and novice, I think I should be using hammer fired handguns to be familiar with guns and stuff. If hammer or no hammer is not a problem and I shud pick one based on internet reviews, I''ll go for CZ Duty with my eyes closed. Personal choice, no offence meant.\n \n[B]CZ Duty VS CZ 999[/B]\n \nWell, that&#8217;s an awkward comparison. Charade GTTI or Baleno are cheaper than VTI, could outrun vti oreal, and their consumption is quite better than VTU but still people buy VTI oreal, are they stupid or what or there are few things like brand loyalty, or ego, or lust for having good thing whether not it outperforms its cheaper competitor. Its as simple as you read it. So, if price is not the factor, CZ Duty anytime of the day. No comparison whatsoever. :p\n\nHere are pix of my queen :p\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10546[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]10548[/ATTACH]\n\nDenovo bro, Naved bro, any help for pix ...

Please be very careful in manual decocking and rehearse or pratcice with empty chambered handgun.\nYou can use many safe techniques for decocking.While decocking you can hold hammer with thumb and middle finger while keeping your index finger ahead of hammer and release it slowly.It is quite safe as if accidently hammer slips, your index finger will act as cushion or a shock absorber between hammer and firing pin.\nGood luck and safe firing.', 1, 0, '182.178.86.9', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

After the gun cost you need to keep in ming the cost of a decent scope, mounts (as most PCPs come without sights) adapter/connector, along with a reliable pump (the best in my opinion is the HILL pump as they are built to last a lifetime). The pump alone should cost you approx $300 (HILL pump) and 200$ (Benjamin, Axsor or any other pumps).\nas opposed to that a springer is good to go anytime (no pumping and extra costs) :p so im really confused right now :p BTW for your desired range and quarry why dont you go for .22 firepower :p', 1, 0, '202.61.45.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Just few days later i talked to Denovo87 bro and asked him for his expert opinion, then later talked to bbiillaall bro for his, and he advised me to buy a 1911 first. He said bro if you didn''t fire a .45ACP then you haven''t fired anything and no doubt the .45ACP is a awesome caliber. After that i was so much confused that i couldn''t decide what to buy. i made up my mind that i''ll decide what to buy at the shop after seeing and handling both guns. When i got to Lahore, I was inclining more towards the .45acp. But to my surprise the prices of Taurus 1911 had skyrocketed and i could find Taurus 1911 without rails, i didn''t like the one with rails, i think the the ugly rails of Taurus ruins the 1911 looks. Second choice was Zigana 1911, couldn''t find that too. So decided to go for the 357. Now faced another decision, either to go for sleek and better looking 627 Tracker or Big, Beefy, Hunky 608 with a extra round capacity. So again confused, but decided to go with the 608, because it had more weight, so lesser recoil expected. Extra round of 357, more the marry. The best thing was 608 was with ported barrel and the 627 wasn''t. Also like the balance of the 608. It was balanced in the middle and the 627 was bit nose heavy, and i had already decide to buy one with 6.5 inch barrel. These were big guns and i''m not a big guy so 608 seemed a logical choice. After firing the gun for the first time at Sialkot after the Caracal vs Glock Showdown, i was in love with this gun. The accuracy of this gun is mind boggling. We all were hitting everything we were aiming for, be it the Pepsi bottles or the empty Shaheen shotgun shells. It was killing targets. There is almost no muzzle rise, the felt recoil was less then the 9mm, all because of the weight and ported barrel of 608. Ah! don''t even get me started about the sonic boom the .357 mag creates and the sound is it makes. Awesome! The 608 is a so fun to shoot and acuraacy of the gun is so phenomenon that i can shoot this gun all day no problem. The trigger in SA mode is so light and crisp that you can only see it to believe it. The DA pull is long and heavy but manageable. Infact the SA pull of the trigger is so light that i still can''t get use to it, and it keep shooting the gun low.

So yes, the logic applies to firearms aswell, that the heavier the firearm is, the lesser the recoil will be. I hope this helps explain why the gun''s weight affects the recoil.

You see, when the projectile/bullet leaves the firearm with speed, that is called "action" and newton''s third law of motion says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so the force with which the bullet leaves the firearm exerts the same amount of rearward force on the firearm which gives a jerk to the firearm and consequently, the shooter''s hand. So yes, the logic applies to firearms aswell, that the heavier the firearm is, the lesser the recoil will be. I hope this helps explain why the gun''s weight affects the recoil.

The main (220V AC) is connected to UPS, what it do, it converts (220V AC) into 12V DC and supply this charge to battery. While the charge controller controls this process.

There are lots of associate who are far experienced and their expert opinion may add some knowledge to novice like me also.\n\nFor you perusal please:- \n\n4 &#8211; Ideal number of decoys varies according to situation always. For example, widespread open water may need 5 dozen or more decoys sometime. \n\nUsually 3 dozen decoys are more than enough in most situations. They may work more than 100, if properly placed. As we discussed in above simply try to set the pattern in a way that each decoy should have its own appearance while ducks approaching them. \n\nIn marshes, always place groups of decoys and open lading zone nearer 2 u. These groups some time placed at 40 yards to make them visual in dense marshes by birds passing over head. These groups should set in a ways that no adequate landing zone should left around them as an option to decoy landing birds. Landing zone should open near you and insisting birds to sit there. \n\nWind factor will be again vital here, otherwise ducks will cross you with greater speed and shooting may result in loss of many birds in the marshes or koondar. However, it inevitable, you always suffer a good number of ducks especially winger.\n\nUsually, mojo cannot be places at such places due to deep water or bogging but mojo is not that necessary in marshes where birds expected to stay. Your call will do the trick, as soon as birds crosses your spread call them with single quacks or feeding chuckle. Never call birds that are eager to enjoy your guns i.e. in marshes usually your call works at a unbelievable height and birds will respond to your call with closed wings often and reach you like a rocket. \n\nTry never shot highly declining birds, swinging down barrels never results too good. Let them encircle your trap and enjoy shooting.\n\nThese are personal experiences / judgments please, open for debate always.\n\nAs you said u r know to H1, feel free the meet sometime. It doesn&#8217;t look appropriate to reply in such a way that people start chanting slogans &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. \n\nAnyhow, what else do you want to share??? if unanswered.\n\nMallards are the cleverest birds while flying over open water. Open Hideout barring height over 2 feet will be a challenge for them, they are not gadwalls for sure&#8230;&#8230; haahahaha &#8230;&#8230; \n\nTry a low height hide always (Where mallards flight pasing over), if hunting in open water, results will be changed. \n\nMallard is the easiest birds in marshes but the most intelligent species while fly over open water especially in flocks greater than 5 birds. \n\nEnjoy game !!!!!!![/QUOTE]\n\nExcellent Detail .

The Smith and Wesson you are talking about is the Sigma, it is NOT a Glock Copy, it costs about $300 in the States, and is sold here at a ridiculous price of 110k (over $1200) because there is an embargo on weapons to Pakistan from USA. The Taurus is not a Beretta Copy, the complete manufacturing plant was purchased by Taurus from Beretta alongwith the RIGHTS to manufacture the pistol, so it is not right to call it a copy.\r\nNow coming to Daudsons, in my personal opinion the weapons made by them are of much better quality than our other local manufacturers, but still not as good in finish as imported weapons. Coming to your point, even though I dont know for a fact that shotguns are sold for 330k in the uk, but I''m sure if they are then they must be good because that translates to around 2200 GBP, and to my knowledge you can get some really good options in this price range, like various Beretta shotguns. Now, Daudsons Shotguns maybe really good, but are they better than Beretta Shotguns? Highly unlikely, simply because of almost 500 years of experience that the people at beretta have. :)\r\nNow, my point is that this handgun is cheaper than most foreign brands beacuse it lacks finish, fit and judging from the these 2, I would say functionality as well. The PB rifle you are talking about is a German design and is manufactured under license i.e the manufacturing technology/skills have been sold by H&K to POF. The beretta clone/copy on the other hand, is just a copy. What I fail to understand here is if you have to copy, why copy a design that is very sensitive to the quality of materials involved. The beretta 92fs is one of the most successful combat handgun of all time, but people who are into weapons will have to agree that the locking lug, and where it locks to the slide is the most sensitive part in this gun, it is where the gun is most prone to breakage, an issue that Beretta has ALMOST removed by using materials of the highest possible quality. Can POF ensure that such a failure will not happen in this gun? only time will tell, that too if someone takes it upon themselves to test this weapon to its fullest. I still dont understand that if a weapon was needed, why didnt POF manufacture something that used the Browning Breech Lock Principles(like the Browning Hi Power, or the CZ 75) or even a modified  Browning Breech lock(like the Sig or the Glock). They are easier to make, and much more robust. I''m not really sure where I read it, but India makes a copy of the Browning Hi-Power. \r\n\r\nAnd Brother, I have no idea about tanks, so I''d rather stick to what I know. :D\r\n\r\nPS. I hope that this handgun turns out to be reliable and robust, but they definitely need improvement in the finishing department, internal as well as external.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '119.154.46.229', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

One day, the bunny was hopping through the forest, and the snake was slithering through the forest, when the bunny tripped over the snake and fell down. This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit. ''Oh, my'', said the bunny,\n\n''I'' m terribly sorry. I didn''t mean to hurt you. I''ve been blind since birth, so, I can''t see where I '' m going. In fact, since I '' m also an orphan, I don''t even know what I am.''\n\nIt’s quite OK,'' replied the snake. ''Actually, my story is as yours. I too have been blind since birth, and also never knew my mother. Tell you what, maybe I could slither all over you , and work out what you are so at least you''ll have that going for you.''\n\n''Oh, that would be wonderful'' replied the bunny. So the snake slithered all over the bunny, and said, ''Well, you are covered with soft fur, you have really long ears, your nose twitches, and you have a soft cottony tail. I''d say that you must be a bunny rabbit.''\n\n''Oh, thank you, thank you,'' cried the bunny, in obvious excitement. The bunny suggested to the snake,'' Maybe I could feel you all over with my paw, and help you the same way that you''ve helped me.''\n\nSo the bunny felt the snake all over, and remarked, ''Well, you''re smooth and slippery, and you have a forked tongue, no backbone and no balls. \n\nI''d say you must be an executive officer, supervisor or possibly someone in senior management.''[/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 0, '182.179.127.123', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Anyway I was thankful to them for all the help, they sent a guy along me to photo studio since I needed 4 passport sized photos that I didn''t have...  I paid them 10k advance for the license. He told me that I can get license for around 14k from saddar too but they might turn out to be fake so why take risk.\n\nAnother point I was worried about that I didn''t want my license to be allocated from any political part quota, (just wondering some dealers might use their sources in parties to acquire licenses easily for their customers)... Possible? That is why I decided to pay 20k to some reputed dealer instead.\n\nNow at this point when I am already looking into the guns so I can buy one as soon as I get my license...

Its good to hear that the gun is going strong. Do keep us posted as the rounds increase. :)\r\n\r\nAsfandyar bro, you are mixing two things up.\r\nFirst let us talk of handguns. As compared to PK9, we have quite a few options.... firstly the chinese TT, it costs 22-24 k and is a time tested, battle tested handgun. It is also cheaper than the PK9. Then there is the M57, another reliable TT but a tad expensive. Other options are yet a little more expensive, like the CZ999, Canik, NP22 etc. At around 50k, these are tested platforms.\r\nComing to shotguns, POF doesn''t make any. You yourself stated that DSA shotguns are good, so why dont you go for their double barrel shotgun, which should be less than 20k? Simple, its because the Baikal is a BETTER option.\r\nI guess it all depends on the intended use of the weapon. A weapon for SD/HD is something that you dont want to take a risk on. Similarly, a serious hunter would also take his gun very seriously. If you still have some spare dough,well then I guess its perfectly fine if you decide to buy a new weapon and test it out. :)\r\n\r\nAnd.....Like I said earlier, nothing would make me happier than seeing a Pakistani Handgun selling like hot cakes in US and Europe. :D\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '119.154.121.6', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Do keep us posted as the rounds increase. :)\n\nAsfandyar bro, you are mixing two things up.\nFirst let us talk of handguns. As compared to PK9, we have quite a few options.... firstly the chinese TT, it costs 22-24 k and is a time tested, battle tested handgun. It is also cheaper than the PK9. Then there is the M57, another reliable TT but a tad expensive. Other options are yet a little more expensive, like the CZ999, Canik, NP22 etc. At around 50k, these are tested platforms.\nComing to shotguns, POF doesn''t make any. You yourself stated that DSA shotguns are good, so why dont you go for their double barrel shotgun, which should be less than 20k? Simple, its because the Baikal is a BETTER option.\nI guess it all depends on the intended use of the weapon. A weapon for SD/HD is something that you dont want to take a risk on. Similarly, a serious hunter would also take his gun very seriously. If you still have some spare dough,well then I guess its perfectly fine if you decide to buy a new weapon and test it out. :)\n\nAnd.....Like I said earlier, nothing would make me happier than seeing a Pakistani Handgun selling like hot cakes in US and Europe. :D\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nAgreed with you brother. :)', 1, 0, '119.154.17.58', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

These accidents do happen every place even in USA if your Rifle or Ammo is faulty or you are not careful enough about safety issues before discharging your rifle.\n\nI have noticed some of us are not safety minded when it comes to weapon handling and discharging their weapons.\n\n\nAs you all know, Gun Dealers have been unable to import rifles or rifle ammo for some time due to restrictions or some regulations. Some fresh import rifle ammo is available in the market but at very high price, forcing people to look for cheaper alternative.\n\nSo because of this there is all kinds of fake ammo or (dara made or modified) ammo and rifles being sold in the market as original. \n\nThis is not to offend or discourage anyone from buying old locally modified or local made rifles, but just to advice everyone to be more careful and be 100% sure of your weapon and ammo being fit before using it. \n\nBelow are some Photos from the net of rifle Accident.\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10678[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10679[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]10680[/ATTACH]\n\n\nThis accident happened because the guy discharged the rifle with laser bore sight still inside the barrel.\nAny obstruction in a gun or rifle barrel can cause the gun to explode. The gases pushing the projectile will expand at their normal rate. If they can''t escape through their normal route, the barrel will explode for sure.\nMost Common rifle accident, discharging faulty round in a rifle will lead to projectile being stuck in the barrel (this is common with Dara made ammo), many people will reload the rifle and discharge another round without realizing the obstruction in the barrel.

How many others got duped because of that misleading review?[/COLOR]\n\n\nAns (a) I contacted Mr Murad who is the manager there several times. Guy is really courteous but insisted that I handover the gun to them for repair in Peshawer that too free of cost. He did not agree to courier to me the required parts nor to hand them over to my friend in Peshawer. According to him their local dealers in Karachi can''t help me with repair. Gun was in Karachi and it was not possible for me each time to take it to Peshawer for repair. I got the gun repaired from DSA Peshawer once for replacement of Mag tube which was done free of cost. Rest of the problems were rectified by local gunsmith.\n\nAns (b) I bought the through that guy without him getting any financial gains from the deal. I bought it for a total of 23k with box so price was quite reasonable. He still thinks that this product is of good quality and I may have misused it or this particular piece was a lemon.\n\nAns (c) I don''t believe he misled anyone. He genuinely believes it is an outstanding product.

Though I mightn''t have been posting very often, my heart is definitely here! \r\n\r\nBut to begin at the beginning! I had a Mossberg 500 and a Winchester pump from my "Bad" days! The pump was to intimidate and I plead guilty to that vice till I saw the light! But I was PRETTTY good with a shotgun, if I may blow my own trumpet and one fine but fateful day, I was revelling in the euphoria of my excellent shooting on the roof of my Gulberg house when I proved to myself that I wasn''t at all as good as I made myself out to be because that euphoria made me lose my concentration and nearly cost me my foot! YES! I nearly ACTUALLY shot myself in the foot!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that day on, I never thought myself worthy enough of handling a shotgun and so put the guns away, only to soon sell them. \r\n\r\nCome about a month ago, I decided on taking a chance and dipping just my toes in the fast and deep current of shotgunning again and bought a low-budget Turkish repeater chambered for 3" shells. I particularly asked for a gun that would take slugs because I enjoying the feeling of powerful recoil, so salesmen Nabeel and Umar at my distant relative Sardar Adil Omar''s Chaudhry Arms in Gulberg passed me a Torn Silah Sanayi TS 870 Commando Magnum with a fibre optic from sight.\r\n\r\nI very promptly informed my avid shikari friend Kochi (as Henry is fondly known) that I was bringing over my new purchase for his approval, or otherwise. Kochi was visibly impressed but somewhat incredulous about the gun, not ever having heard of it. These guys were heavy duty bird-gunners whereas I was quite heavy duty the opposite! However, he decided not to take it apart because he said he might not be familiar with any new technology, if any. \r\n\r\nto cut a long story short short, Kochi and his expert son Ahsan took me shooting off Ferozepur Road near where they live and since I had just 8 cartridges, I turned down their offer to see me shoot the new gun because I wanted their expert opinion on how the gun behaved. Well, they enjoyed shooting it! Not a hitch! The quick double taps left no FTFs more FTEs. \r\n\r\nThat was their experience, I haven''t fired ONE shot from it after that.

To cut it short I completely agree with what is written by @Armughan, so much so that as if he stole words of my mouth. CZ Duty was never on the list of weapons I wanted to buy for my first ever gun. But after drilling down to the choices that I made i.e. Taurus 809, Cougar and Sarsilmaz, I just couldn''t find the perfect combination of finish, reliability, accuracy, fire power, weight and value for money until I came across the CZ duty.

If you''re used to of shooting with open sights then you won''t even notice if your airgun faces this issue; why? because your open sights are mounted on your barrel hence they are in line with the direction your barrel is pointing at. But you mount your scope on the receiver and the scope''s line of sight needs to be adjusted accordingly. The slightest inconsistency between the barrel and receiver (at the breech where the barrel meets the receiver) would mean your scope''s line of sight will mismatch the pellet''s trajectory. in most cases barrel droop causes the shots to land lower , and even relaxing the scope''s vertical adjustment to the fullest will not allow you to align the both. Here, another problem creeps in! since your vertical adjustment is relaxed, the spring holding the scope tube in place loses its control over the tube and the recoil causes the scope tube to vibrate hence yo lose your zero and need to re-adjust it after every couple of shots or so which eventually causes damage to the scope tube and you can say goodbye to your scope. there are many videos on youtube that explain barrel droop a lot better than i have :p so if you havent understood my gibberish here, refer to those videos :)', 1, 0, '202.61.45.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You simply shoulder the rifle in a ‘heads up’ position viewing the cross-hairs of your day scope on the LCD screen mounted on the top of the scope! The NiteSite system has an infra-red camera that fits to a regular day scope using a flexible sleeve. Once the camera is put in place and connected to the LCD screen and illuminator module, the image of the cross-hairs is clearly visible on the LCD screen! It is that simple!\r\n\r\nThe LCD screen and illuminator module has an infra red beam that is switched in four increments from off to full by turning the switch on top of the illuminator unit. The infra red camera module can see the infra red light very clearly. This method of night vision can give a recognisable image up to a distance of 200 yards with the NS200 model, and in excess of 50 yards for the NS50 model. This will depend on the quality of the day scope optics that are in use at the time.\r\n\r\nNiteSite is a very easy way to achieve night vision for your day scope rifle combo. There is no need to remove your day scope for this system, there is no need for re-sighting your day scope recalibrating any part of your set-up for this system, it is a very easy plug and play system that will convert your day set up into a night vision set up in just a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nSo you can shoot throughout the night coupled with the day [B]without your prey even noticing you![/B] It''s a must for HUGE HUGE bags!!\r\n\r\n[B]Cost:[/B]\r\n\r\nNiteSite - NS50         £399.00 + £10 p&p* = PKR 60,000\r\nNiteSite - NS200        £599.00 + £10 p&p* = PKR 88,500\r\n\r\n[B]Some videos for practicality:[/B]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hLWVSCP5qNc[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFM7VdafL64&feature=g-u-u[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgzwYBee9eg&feature=channel&list=UL[/url]\r\n\r\n[B]To place your order visit[/B] [url]www.nitesite.co.uk[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nites.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nitesite.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/ns.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nss.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[U]Verdict:[/U][B]A must buy if you''re a keen vibrant hunter and have the budget![/B]\r\n\r\nWoooooooooohooooooooooooooooo I need one :)', 1, 1, '119.73.4.240', 0, 1, 0, 0, 9052, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You simply shoulder the rifle in a ‘heads up’ position viewing the cross-hairs of your day scope on the LCD screen mounted on the top of the scope! The NiteSite system has an infra-red camera that fits to a regular day scope using a flexible sleeve. Once the camera is put in place and connected to the LCD screen and illuminator module, the image of the cross-hairs is clearly visible on the LCD screen! It is that simple!\r\n\r\nThe LCD screen and illuminator module has an infra red beam that is switched in four increments from off to full by turning the switch on top of the illuminator unit. The infra red camera module can see the infra red light very clearly. This method of night vision can give a recognisable image up to a distance of 200 yards with the NS200 model, and in excess of 50 yards for the NS50 model. This will depend on the quality of the day scope optics that are in use at the time.\r\n\r\nNiteSite is a very easy way to achieve night vision for your day scope rifle combo. There is no need to remove your day scope for this system, there is no need for re-sighting your day scope recalibrating any part of your set-up for this system, it is a very easy plug and play system that will convert your day set up into a night vision set up in just a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nSo you can shoot throughout the night coupled with the day [B]without your prey even noticing you![/B] It''s a must for HUGE HUGE bags!!\r\n\r\n[B]Cost:[/B]\r\n\r\nNiteSite - NS50         £399.00 + £10 p&p* = PKR 60,000\r\nNiteSite - NS200        £599.00 + £10 p&p* = PKR 88,500\r\n\r\n[B]Some videos for practicality:[/B]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hLWVSCP5qNc[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFM7VdafL64&feature=g-u-u[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgzwYBee9eg&feature=channel&list=UL[/url]\r\n\r\n[B]To place your order visit[/B] [url]www.nitesite.co.uk[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nites.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nitesite.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/ns.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nss.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[U]Verdict:[/U][B]A must buy if you''re a keen vibrant hunter and have the budget![/B]\r\n\r\nWoooooooooohooooooooooooooooo I need one :)[/quote]', 1, 0, '111.92.146.122', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is an affectionate, excitable breed with an average lifespan of twelve to fourteen years. Descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century, the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to "rage syndrome", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely with the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. They are commonly used as sniffer dogs by various nations.

Of all the airguns, I have shot, I liked BSA and Wehrauch the best. The former I liked until a few years ago, and then their quality went downhill. The latter I have yet to find complaint  with. The best Weihrauch I have ever shot was a friend''s HW80 (tuned FAC version) imported from the UK. This gun had very smooth cocking, very tame recoil, an amazingly crisp trigger and awesome accuracy (with Crosman Premier pellets). \n\nWith my own FAC version HW80 (0.22cal), I have had outstanding accuracy shooting H&N Barracuda Match pellets. While these pellsts are not cheap, they are perhaps the best one can get for the more powerful springers and PCPs.\n\nThe airgun that I find the most fun and most accurate to shoot (out of the box) is the HW30. I have two of them (both 0.177 cal), and one of them has an after market spring and spring guide. These two parts cost me around USD100 but they are well worth the expense. The most accurate pellet in this gun has been the RWS Superdome. \n\nMy first airgun was a tap-loading, underlever 1916 model BSA (0.177cal) which belonged to my grandfather. I shot my first dove with it. Sadly this gun was lost by one of my cousins about twenty years ago. My second one was a BSA Meteor (0.177cal) which I got in 1986, and this I used till 2001, (with annual change of mainspring, piston seal and breech seal). This was more powerful and more accurate (using Eley Wasps), than the underlever gun, and with it I shot several thousand birds, mostly starlings, sparrows, pigeons and doves  (to feed my hawks). Sadly, I gave this gun to an deserving friend who wrecked it within a few months and returned to me in pieces. However, by that time I had gotten myself the HW80, which I use to this day. \n\nTwo years ago, I picked up another BSA Meteor (read parts in a plastic bag), so from the ashes of two Meteors, a new one wa ressurected a few months ago, and so far it hasbeen doing well. \n\nRegarding PCPs, my sincere advice to anyone using them or desirous of using them is to use dry air (also known as diver''s air) or then compressed nitrogen, as this too is a dry gas.

It is an affectionate, excitable breed with an average lifespan of twelve to fourteen years. Descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century, the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to "rage syndrome", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely with the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. They are commonly used as sniffer dogs by various nations. The term springer comes from their historic hunting role, where the dogs would "spring" or "flush" birds into the air.\n\nand for more information plz see  \n\n[URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Springer_Spaniel[/URL]\n\nonce again thanks.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanks for the info Sarwar bro', 1, 1, '39.45.178.209', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Of all the airguns, I have shot, I liked BSA and Wehrauch the best. The former I liked until a few years ago, and then their quality went downhill. The latter I have yet to find complaint  with. The best Weihrauch I have ever shot was a friend''s HW80 (tuned FAC version) imported from the UK. This gun had very smooth cocking, very tame recoil, an amazingly crisp trigger and awesome accuracy (with Crosman Premier pellets). \n\nWith my own FAC version HW80 (0.22cal), I have had outstanding accuracy shooting H&N Barracuda Match pellets. While these pellsts are not cheap, they are perhaps the best one can get for the more powerful springers and PCPs.\n\nThe airgun that I find the most fun and most accurate to shoot (out of the box) is the HW30. I have two of them (both 0.177 cal), and one of them has an after market spring and spring guide. These two parts cost me around USD100 but they are well worth the expense. The most accurate pellet in this gun has been the RWS Superdome. \n\nMy first airgun was a tap-loading, underlever 1916 model BSA (0.177cal) which belonged to my grandfather. I shot my first dove with it. Sadly this gun was lost by one of my cousins about twenty years ago. My second one was a BSA Meteor (0.177cal) which I got in 1986, and this I used till 2001, (with annual change of mainspring, piston seal and breech seal). This was more powerful and more accurate (using Eley Wasps), than the underlever gun, and with it I shot several thousand birds, mostly starlings, sparrows, pigeons and doves  (to feed my hawks). Sadly, I gave this gun to an deserving friend who wrecked it within a few months and returned to me in pieces. However, by that time I had gotten myself the HW80, which I use to this day. \n\nTwo years ago, I picked up another BSA Meteor (read parts in a plastic bag), so from the ashes of two Meteors, a new one wa ressurected a few months ago, and so far it hasbeen doing well. \n\nRegarding PCPs, my sincere advice to anyone using them or desirous of using them is to use dry air (also known as diver''s air) or then compressed nitrogen, as this too is a dry gas. Using air from a hand pump or a scuba compressor without a moisture trap and filter will cause condensation inside the gun and make it rust.[/QUOTE]\nBsa is not known for its quality in spring airguns but one of the best pcps.weihrauch has some good ones,And using a pcp in Karachi is not a good idea.Any kind of filling works fine in Islamabad except for rain season in summers.', 1, 0, '119.154.119.121', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Daud. now we are sitting in this gigantic office with an  aged Man, told him the problem and he said, Dont worry ... our guns are known to be rugged and relible, he himself inspected the Gun and experienced the malfunction...  called Mr Murad Ali and told him to give us a new Gun to replace this one and showed his great concern for this issue ...also he wanted to have report on how this happened and how to prevent it afterwards...Mr Murad Ali left....  again me, my friend and Mr Hakim-ud-din  are sitting there... he says... whats your program... i told him... i am going to go outside to have breakfast as i left RWP too early to have one already while gun gets ready.....  he say, why would you go outside just for a breakfast?  :)and goes back to his table.... 5 mins later there comes a guy with parathas, omelettes and tea, Wow.....  now he takes us to another table where breakfast is served...  after having breakfast.... he tells us to visit his factory as we please.... we wandered here and there, every single worker present there treated me like i am the new MD, or atleast just like its my own Uncle''s business place....  Mr Murad Ali showed me workshops and kept informing me about the specific machines and items.... and indeed this was no less than COOL.\n\n            at the workshop of shotguns.... they presented all three models of shooter and i picked 5+1...  fired it..... for fist time i shoulder fired a shotgun and i honestly salute all those people who do this every now and then specially with DSA guns.... coz after 3rd shot i seriously wished to stop the shooting and massage my shoulder... lol. anyway fired 10 shots with like a crying heart and mourning shoulder.... they punched my serial numbers on barrel and by a tiny mistake the word SHOOTER  gets double Pressed....  as i am seeing the barrel with a sad look.. just for a single ( R ) letter getting double pressed...... Mr Murad Ali notices my hesitation and orders to bring a new barrel....  again its test fired ( not by me,,, No sir )  numbers are punched thru that press machine.... barrel goes for powder coating...   then in a furnace for a while....  during that visit, most importantly i would like to add that  i talked to the workers there, my main question to every one ( even to Sir Hakim-ud-din ) was,,,, what is difference between shooter and security....how shooter is better than security version and all of them replied in their own words... i wont share what they said.... but i can tell you this, after reading so much about DSA on pakguns...and after talking to the actual people of DSA.and checking every tiny detail of manufacturing both shotguns...... all i can share is...what 12GAUGE says in his reviews about DSA shotguns is cent per cent Accurate. no one on pakguns knows DSA  better than him, anyway\n\nwhile barrel is getting done.... we are asked to come back in Mr Hakim-ud-din''s office.... as i enter, he says... Boys, tell me your names..  i introduced myself and my friend... i told him that i am a Constable in Rwp Police.... and after that we chatted for quite a while.....he showed me some of the Most expensive sxs shotguns i have ever seen and he asked me to have a feel of them.... there are 20, 12, and 410 gauge guns laying on table before me and none is less than exactly 4,400 euro''s.... :) Mr Hakim-ud-din appreciates me as i discuss with him about fire arms with a 1 cent worth of  knowledge that i have.....  he again picks the fone and asks me,,, have you ever enjoyed the mutton tikka karahi of peshawar... i tell him, No sir and please do not even think about it.... we already are so greatful to you for a nice breakfast.... but he insists and says... i would love to have your company during lunch time.... ok, i agreed.  guys brought mutton tikka karahi and chiken karahi, drinks and everything...  he personaly admired my attitude as i showed no formality in lunch and enjoyed it like i would in my own home :) we talked about law and order sitiuation, business, food, hunting and travelling......  i felt like i am talking with a young man of my age, he is that much attentive to me and we had some good laughs.....   my Gun gets ready,,,,  i plan to leave, he comes out of his office, walks with me to the main gate, every worker/guard present in that compound is walking with me now to escort me ....  we embraced each other,   said Good bye and  left.', 1, 1, '39.47.109.80', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Then I became interested in getting a PCP, could only manage from Dubai easily... called Al Sayad, again NO PCP available EXCEPT Walther 1250D. Even though wanted the HW100, accepted the fact that 1250 was the only one I could get... NOW I asked them the price of the gun and pump, and then they said: We don''t have the pump... and weren''t expecting anytime soon. So NO PCP. This was a real bummer.\n\n Called some weeks later, still no 54/56. So I got interested in the HW80... have hunted alot with my cousin''s but never shot at paper targets so have no clue of it''s real accuracy... Yes it''s really accurate, but how does it compare to the 54/56?

Otherwise, their quality control lets an unacceptable number of duds get through.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana](b) In Pakistan, the markups are stupid, so the only serious guns (i.e., with an exceptional pedigree) that are not overly-overly expensive are CZs, in my opinion. The markups are still pretty steep but not as crazy as the ones from the export ban countries.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana](c) I have decided on CZ Duty rather than Rami on purely functional grounds for ''every day carry'' (EDC) - CC in IWB. Based on pure looks Rami is a clear winner, though.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana] \n(d) Caracal does not have enough track record (from my personal perspective) for me to trust it for EDC. However, I will get the F model for a spot of range shooting. Though,the C model feels better (despite the fact that I can''t get all my fingers on the grip) to shoot with, I intend to get the F simply to have (some limited) variety in terms of size. Separately, I consider QS to be of limited use. In a ''situation'', I reckon it would be instinctive point and shoot. If one has the luxury to take aim through the sights, one would probably want the longer sights (and not QS) for accuracy.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]Just as an aside, anyone have any idea how much a CZ 75 B (or BD) would cost in Karachi?[/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana]N.B.

Last time I checked (and it was almost a year ago), issuance of MOI licenses was stopped by the interior ministry of Pakistan. I acknowledge that provincial licenses have been available almost throughout the period, but due to some reasons, the licenses issued by provincial ministries were just not enough as per the conditional requirements.\n\nI recently visited the interior ministry website again... The page that used to display something like "Issuance of MOI licenses to public has been stopped until further notice" now displays a comprehensive list of requirements and procedures to obtain an MOI license! Does that mean the issuance of MOI licenses has been resumed?\n\nUnfortunately, there is no hard link to the page (I think that''s because their ASP scripts have some bugs, or maybe they have been intentionally designed this way).
