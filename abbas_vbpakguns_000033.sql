(29948, 634, 14659, 'TalalKhan', 680, '', 1244882648, 'This brief by RANDY WAKEMAN on weight of shotgun would help you guys to understand much better ;);)\nThere are trends as to what shotgun weight works best, trends that have proved their merits over time. By no means absolutes; they are good starting points in looking at a new shotgun for a specific application.\n\n [b]UPLAND[/b]\nIn upland hunting you are walking all day and your shotgun must constantly be at the ready to fire. Author John Brindle (Shotgun Shooting Techniques and Technology) has noted that six to seven pound shotguns are in the area that makes the most sense. Anything much lighter than a six pound gun is too whippy to easily maintain a smooth swing and too much over seven pounds becomes a real pain to lug around by the end of the day. A Beretta A303 20 or Browning B-80 20 gauge is about as light a shotgun as I can swing smoothly and follow through. These are guns approaching the six pound area. Browning A-5 20 Mags and Sweet Sixteens are both closer to seven pounds, depending on barrel length, year of manufacture, and wood density, yet are still pleasant to carry. As much as I really appreciate A-5''s, there is nothing truly light about a "Light Twelve." Weighing around eight and a half pounds, the older I get the more I can feel such guns at the end of the day. An easy way to test shotgun weight is just to shoot a few crossers at the local skeet field or sporting clays course. If you need to consciously force your scattergun to keep swinging, you have probably gone a bit too far in the lightweight, whippy, stutter swing direction.\n\n [b]DOVE / SPORTING CLAYS[/b]\nFor dove hunting and sporting clays use, guns weighing from seven to eight pounds appear to be the most popular. Not having to walk nearly as far, the smoother swing and lower recoil of a heavier gun helps far more than it hurts. Most any weight gun can be used, but as far as I''m concerned any type of high volume shooting calls for a heavier, softer shooting gun.\n\n [b]SKEET[/b]\nEight to nine pounds is most popular in American skeet, in all gauges, because smoothly redundant swings are needed and hundreds of shells may be fired in one day. In the long run, it''s easier to be better with a heavy gun. Since we can shoot with our shotguns pre-mounted, there is no rush getting them up to the shoulder, either.\n\n [b]TRAP[/b]\n[i]Most of the top shooters want a gun over eight pounds and a lot of winners go to ten-pound guns or even heavier. Like skeet, trap shooting starts with the gun pre-mounted, and hundreds of shells may be fired in a day. Weight is not much of an issue, while long sighting planes (30-34 inch barrels are typical) and smooth swings rule the day.[/i]\n\n [b]WATERFOWL[/b]\nPumps and semi-autos are a fairly easy choice in a tight blind, as guns that need to be broken open to reload can be a real pain. Weight is no issue, and the heavier loads used and longer shots sometimes presented mean many opt for 30" barrels and a heavier, smoother swinging guns for pass shooting. Over decoys, 30 inch tubes have little advantage over shorter barrels, with the exception that some of the slower powders loaded in steel or other "no-tox" shot loads need plenty of barrel length to combust fully. A 16 or 20 gauge gun can actually do a pretty good job killing ducks over decoys.\n\n [b]TURKEY[/b]\nShooting relatively stationary targets on the ground is the antithesis of wing-shooting. Most anything can, and has, been used. However, most folks seem to want short-barreled, lightweight guns that are easy to carry. Fortunately, considering the heavy payloads normally employed, turkey hunting isn''t high-volume shotgunning. Not too many folks feel the gun after calling in a big tom.\n\n [b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nThese are just generalizations, and what you choose is a matter of individual preference. It does suggest that, although shooters are often searching for the best "all-around" shotgun, there really is no such thing and never has been.', 0, 1, '210.2.140.76', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 897, 35509),

(29999, 373, 6773, 'Thunder', 124, '', 1244896308, '[b]SriLanka Orders 22 Al-khalids Tanks[/b]\n\nIt was the Pakistani defence cooperation with Sri Lanka as one of the largest suppliers of high-tech military equipment that has played a major role in the ultimate defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at the hands of the Lankan army.\n\nThe three decade long quest of the LTTE to carve out a separate state for Tamils, as well as the myth that the Tamil Tigers are militarily invincible, has effectively been laid to rest, along with its supremo, Velupillai Prabhakaran, and the entire LTTE top brass. According to well placed sources in the Pakistani establishment, defence cooperation between Sri Lanka and Pakistan had grown significantly in recent years as Islamabad, unlike New Delhi, had no problems supplying the Lankan army state-of-the-art weaponry to accelerate its counter-insurgency operations against the LTTE which has finally ended with the killing of the most wanted Tamil guerilla fighter Vellupillai Prabhakaran. The sources say it was exactly a year ago in the first week of May 2008 that Sri Lankan Army Chief Lt-Gen Fonseka came to Pakistan and held detailed talks with his Pakistani counterpart Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani to finalise the purchase of high tech arms for the Lankan armed forces, which were embroiled in an intense battle with the LTTE forces even at that time.\n\nDuring his talks with Pakistani military authorities, Lt-Gen Fonseka had finalised a deal as per which Pakistan sold 22 Al-Khalid tanks to Sri Lanka in a deal worth over US$100 million. General Fonseka also gave a shopping list of weaponry worth about US$65 million to the Pakistani military authorities. While the Sri Lankan army chief’s shopping list for the army was pegged at $25 million, the inventory for the Lankan Air Force was worth $40 million. He had further sought 250,000 rounds of 60mm, 81mm, 120mm and 130mm mortar ammunition worth US$ 25 million and 1, 50,000 hand grenades for immediate delivery to the Lankan army within a month. Pakistan also accepted the visiting General’s request to send one shipload of the wherewithal every 10 days to bolster the Lankan military efforts to take over Kilinochchi, the headquarters of the LTTE.\n\nOn Jan 19, 2009, in a meeting between Pakistani Defence Secretary Lt-Gen (retd) Syed Athar Ali and his visiting Lankan counterpart Gotabhaya Rajapakse in Rawalpindi, the two countries had agreed to enhance cooperation in military training, exercises and intelligence sharing regarding terrorism. The agreement came amidst Sri Lankan media reports that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) pilots had participated in several successful air strikes against several military bases of the LTTE in August 2008. These reports further claimed that a highly trained group of the Pakistani armed forces officers is stationed in Colombo to guide the Sri Lankan security forces in their counter-insurgency operations against the LTTE.\n\nHowever, it was not the first time that the Pakistan army was helping Sri Lanka militarily in its prolonged fight against the LTTE guerrilla fighters. Back in 2000, when LTTE offensive code-named Operation Ceaseless Waves overran Sri Lankan military positions in the north and captured the Elephant Pass Base and entered Jaffna, and was being feared that LTTE would run down thousands of Sri Lankan troops stationed in Jaffna, the Sri Lankans had sought Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher System (MBRLS) and other high tech weaponry from Pakistan on urgent basis.\n\nSubsequently, MBRLS and weapons and ammunition, including artillery shells and multi-barrel rocket launchers, were airlifted in an emergency operation from Karachi to Colombo in May 2000. Later, in 2006, the Sri Lankan authorities had again sought Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher System (MBRLS) and other advanced weapons from Pakistan when Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited Pakistan in March 2006 along with an 80-member delegation that included some high ranking military officials. During his talks with the Pakistani leaders, the Sri Lankan President had sought military help from Islamabad to effectively put an end to the LTTE separatist movement.\n\nThat the Lankan and the Pakistani armed forces had been working together in militarily stamping out the LTTE insurgency has already been confirmed by the Sri Lanka Army Spokesman, Brigadier Udaya Nanayakara, in a statement he had made on April 28, 2009, saying Pakistan and India had been training the Sri Lankan troops to deal with the LTTE forces. Separately but consistently, he said, the two countries had trained and equipped the Sri Lankan army to prepare and fight the LTTE. He said Lankan forces have been procuring the latest technology from both countries.\n\n“We had been sending our military officers regularly to India and Pakistan for specialised training. I myself did four courses in India and three in Pakistan. We know they are rivals but we have nothing to do with that and we are benefited from both India and Pakistan,” said the Sri Lankan military spokesman, Brigadier Udaya Nanayakara.\n\nLINK\n\n[url]http://www.netspikes.com/news/pakistannews/Pakistan%E2%80%99s-crucial-role-in-the-death-of-tamil-tigers/[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.228.85', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 35562),

A sonar array is a radar towed behind a ship that listens and locates underwater sounds.\n\nThe incident occurred near Subic Bay off the coast of the Philippines.\n\nThe official, who declined to be named because the incident had not been made public, would not say whether the U.S. ship knew the submarine was that close to it.\n\nHowever, the Navy does not believe this was a deliberate incident of Chinese harassment, as it would have been extremely dangerous had the array gotten caught in the submarine''s propellers.\n\nThe Navy has complained in the past that Chinese vessels, including fishing boats, have deliberately tried to disrupt U.S. naval activities in international waters near China. In one widely publicized incident in March, five Chinese vessels maneuvered close enough to the USNS Impeccable to warrant the use of a fire hose by the unarmed American vessel to avoid a collision. The Navy later released video of that incident.\n\nlink\n\n[url]http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/06/12/china.submarine/index.html[/url]', 0, 1, '118.103.229.28', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 489, 35634),

I suppose that a double barrel shotgun will never miss fire and cartridges don''t stuck in it''s barrel. I don''t have happy experiences with pump-action shotguns specially with local Shaheen cartridges (even imported cartridges have this problem). They tend to stuck in my gun after every 1-2 fires. I searched on internet and found that many companies are manufacturing double-barrel shotguns aimed towards HD market.

Unlike the armed forces, we have no indication of threats in our surroundings. Waiting until the threat has revealed itself to rack the slide seems to be a tad too slow. In many situations, it''s pretty much impossible to use both hands to load the gun (I do know of single handed loading, but its a trick I would never trust). We carry guns for a simple reason: personal defence. An unloaded gun is of as much use as no gun. Today''s double action pistols are designed to be carried loaded.

Initially when I closed it I thought it would stay closed for good but with the dozens of emails that I continue to receive even today and the phone calls and the messages forced me to reverse my decision. PakGuns indeed has a special place in our hearts.\n\nA few minor changes will have to be made as per suggestion of our new lawyer. The first of which is that contact via PM''s and emails through the forum will be disabled, any and all and conversation will be done in the open forum. Nothing behind closed doors. The second change which I am considering implementing some time in the near future is the curtailing or completely disabling of the Marketplace section. InshAllah I will update as needed.\n\nWe will also have one or two new mods soon to help me manage PakGuns. I will InshAllah hand over most of daily forum running to them and move in the background and enjoy the forum just as any other member. \n\nI would like to thank each and every member personally from the bottom of my heart for their support.

(30430, 634, 14659, 'A R K TAREEN', 266, '', 1245950883, '[quote=TalalKhan]This brief by RANDY WAKEMAN on weight of shotgun would help you guys to understand much better ;);)\nThere are trends as to what shotgun weight works best, trends that have proved their merits over time. By no means absolutes; they are good starting points in looking at a new shotgun for a specific application.\n\n [b]UPLAND[/b]\nIn upland hunting you are walking all day and your shotgun must constantly be at the ready to fire. Author John Brindle (Shotgun Shooting Techniques and Technology) has noted that six to seven pound shotguns are in the area that makes the most sense. Anything much lighter than a six pound gun is too whippy to easily maintain a smooth swing and too much over seven pounds becomes a real pain to lug around by the end of the day. A Beretta A303 20 or Browning B-80 20 gauge is about as light a shotgun as I can swing smoothly and follow through. These are guns approaching the six pound area. Browning A-5 20 Mags and Sweet Sixteens are both closer to seven pounds, depending on barrel length, year of manufacture, and wood density, yet are still pleasant to carry. As much as I really appreciate A-5''s, there is nothing truly light about a "Light Twelve." Weighing around eight and a half pounds, the older I get the more I can feel such guns at the end of the day. An easy way to test shotgun weight is just to shoot a few crossers at the local skeet field or sporting clays course. If you need to consciously force your scattergun to keep swinging, you have probably gone a bit too far in the lightweight, whippy, stutter swing direction.\n\n [b]DOVE / SPORTING CLAYS[/b]\nFor dove hunting and sporting clays use, guns weighing from seven to eight pounds appear to be the most popular. Not having to walk nearly as far, the smoother swing and lower recoil of a heavier gun helps far more than it hurts. Most any weight gun can be used, but as far as I''m concerned any type of high volume shooting calls for a heavier, softer shooting gun.\n\n [b]SKEET[/b]\nEight to nine pounds is most popular in American skeet, in all gauges, because smoothly redundant swings are needed and hundreds of shells may be fired in one day. In the long run, it''s easier to be better with a heavy gun. Since we can shoot with our shotguns pre-mounted, there is no rush getting them up to the shoulder, either.\n\n [b]TRAP[/b]\n[i]Most of the top shooters want a gun over eight pounds and a lot of winners go to ten-pound guns or even heavier. Like skeet, trap shooting starts with the gun pre-mounted, and hundreds of shells may be fired in a day. Weight is not much of an issue, while long sighting planes (30-34 inch barrels are typical) and smooth swings rule the day.[/i]\n\n [b]WATERFOWL[/b]\nPumps and semi-autos are a fairly easy choice in a tight blind, as guns that need to be broken open to reload can be a real pain. Weight is no issue, and the heavier loads used and longer shots sometimes presented mean many opt for 30" barrels and a heavier, smoother swinging guns for pass shooting. Over decoys, 30 inch tubes have little advantage over shorter barrels, with the exception that some of the slower powders loaded in steel or other "no-tox" shot loads need plenty of barrel length to combust fully. A 16 or 20 gauge gun can actually do a pretty good job killing ducks over decoys.\n\n [b]TURKEY[/b]\nShooting relatively stationary targets on the ground is the antithesis of wing-shooting. Most anything can, and has, been used. However, most folks seem to want short-barreled, lightweight guns that are easy to carry. Fortunately, considering the heavy payloads normally employed, turkey hunting isn''t high-volume shotgunning. Not too many folks feel the gun after calling in a big tom.\n\n [b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nThese are just generalizations, and what you choose is a matter of individual preference. It does suggest that, although shooters are often searching for the best "all-around" shotgun, there really is no such thing and never has been.[/quote]\n\nTalalkhan\nI am very thankful to you for your detailed reply.

What these clone forums don''t understand is that PakGuns does [b]not[/b] need fancy software or dark themes. All PakGuns is is a brotherhood of friends gathered from Pakistan and abroad to share our passion of guns and to build a community which will benefit us, our neighbors, our nation and our children InshAllah.\n\nWe make no fancy claims like free ammo and gold plated TT''s. :rolleyes: All we have to give is our spirit and our friendship.\n\nWish our friends a farewell and a best of luck in your endeavors. Also if I may make a little request. I understand that all my friends are graceful enough not to call up members of PakGuns and threaten them with dire consequences should they not join their new forums ? :) If we were quiet it was because we respect you and think that one or two times a person can make a foolish mistake but decency should never be taken for weakness. \n\nLong live Pakistan, our most beloved homeland and it''s humble servant PakGuns.', 0, 1, '203.81.193.121', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1515, 36032),

Availabilty and price in Karachi please?\n[url]http://www.baikalinc.ru/en/company/100.html[/url][/quote]\n\n\nA single trigger is the type that fires both barrels in a sequential order, first click bottom barrel, second click top barrel (this order can be reversed, also sometimes, by default it could be top barrel first then bottom barrel second). anyways point is the barrels fire in a sequential manner.\n\nA double trigger is the type where one trigger fires the bottom barrel and second trigger fires the top barrel. since there is a seperate trigger for each barrel, there is no need for a trigger selector (a button or a device that determines which barrel will fire first, found only on single trigger o/u)\n\npreference: hmm.... difficult to answer, kindly allow me to break it down for ya\n\n[b]double trigger:[/b]\n\n[b]pros:[/b]\n\n1. blazing fast trigger\n2. highly reliable trigger mechanism\n3. instant (on the go type) barrel selection, fire the desired barrel instantly\n4. less prune to doubling\n5. no such thing as wrong trigger selection, only that barrel will fire whose trigger is squeezed\n\n[b]cons:[/b]\n\n1. requires considerable training to develop necessary skill in selecting right trigger for the job\n2. alot confusing in the heat of the moment\n3. difficult to manuever/use (my opinion only) with gloves\n4. trigger feel is different for both triggers (my opinion only). however in high end o/u this might not be a problem.\n\n[b]single trigger:[/b]\n\n[b]pros:[/b]\n\n1. extremely simple to use, single trigger for both barrels, u cant miss it\n2. for those who are used to pumps and semiautos, its a blessing\n3. for a simple bloke such as myself, it makes the job alot easier\n\n[b]cons:[/b]\n\n1. decreased life compared to double trigger\n2. prune to doubling\n3. trigger can develop excessive creep after considerable use\n4. barrel selection is extremely difficult "on the go", in the heat of the moment, barrel slection is extremely difficult if not impossible.\n5. sometimes u forget which barrel will fire first, its not the trigger fault, its basically operator fault associated with this type of trigger\n\n[b]to summarize:[/b]\n\nits like comparing an automatic (single trigger) camera to a manual (double trigger) camera. automatic will automatically correct the colors, focus, contrast etc. it will make u''r job alot easier as there are less variables to consider but then again, automatic will do only so many things, a manual camera on the other hand is difficult to use, it will be confusing, u''ll probably endup ruining u''r shots, but some of the most beautiful shots are actually taken by manual cameras, u simply cannot beat the things a manual camera can do in the hands of an expert camera man. there must be a reason why almost all professional camera-men u hear or read about use manual cameras (digital or regular).\n\n[b]Regards.[/b]\n\n[i]p.s. i prefer single trigger, double trigger always confuse the hell out of me. and yes!, i also prefer automatic cameras over manual cameras. :D in the end it all falls down to personal preference[/i]', 0, 1, '58.65.189.137', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 758, 36034),

To my understanding the most important measurments of the shotgun with refference to its fit are LOP(Length of pull), DAC(Drop at comb) and cast. To check that which one is required to be adjusted following things can be done.\n\nFirstly, to check the length of the pull. Bend your shooting arm at right angle the way a bodybuilder shows his mussels. Hold your shotgun in such a way that butt of the gun rests on your arm and receiver of the gun touches your palm and barrel straight up. Now first joint of your index finger must touch the trigger of the gun, if it does length of pull is right for you. If it touches above your first joint of the fingger it needs to be reduced and it needs to be increased if it touches below the joint. Length of pull is the easiest to be changed as some guns come with spacers or you can use a longer or shorter recoil pad as wel. Length of the pull is greatly dependent on the hight of the shooter, length of his arms, his body weight  and the length of his hands. \n\nSecondly, to check the drop at comb(DAC) just close your eyes and mount your shotgun. Now open your eyes and look down the barrel of the shotgun. For an ideal DAC you must see the front beed fully neither too much of the rib nor too much of the back of the receiver. If you see too much of the back of the receiver of your gun, it means that DAC is low and it needs to be reduced (if the comb is adjustable just raise it ). I f you see too much of the rib it means that DAC is high and it needs to be increased(Just lower the comb to get an ideal sight of the front beed). If your gun does not come with an adjustable comb as almost all guns except some sporting models come with fixed combs you need an expert to do the job. You may ruin the beauty of your gun and at the same time can''t measure the exact change to be made.\n\nFinally, cast of the gun. It is the tilt of the butt towards the shooter or away from the shooter. Butts are tilted twards the shooters and a gun tilted towards the right hand shooter is said to be CAST OFF gun. As most of the guns are made for the right hand shooters so they can''t fit the lefties. For a left hand shooter cast will be required to be adjusted. This should also be done by an expert as amount of cast will depend on the built of th shooter.', 0, 1, '119.152.8.135', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1517, 36297),

If you see too much of the back of the receiver of your gun, it means that DAC is low and it needs to be reduced (if the comb is adjustable just raise it ). I f you see too much of the rib it means that DAC is high and it needs to be increased(Just lower the comb to get an ideal sight of the front beed).[/quote]\n\nhere u are dead smack on the target. however i must add that there are latest techniques to this, sometimes, operator cannot tell correctly what he is seeing. it is therefore advised to do pupil alignment test while aiming the gun. here the gun fitter asks u to mount the gun then sees the bead from the muzzle end of the barrel with pupil of the eye in the background, if everything is correct, bead should be right in the middle of the pupil (black/blue/green/brown portion of the eye).\n\ngun fitting is a proper science with a dab of art (my humble opinion). however this process no matter how lengthy and painful will do wonders for the operator.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.189.84', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1517, 36344),

I will try to explain things with my little knowledge about the shotguns. I will start from the point that is not disputeable.\n\nFirstly, your coments about the cast of the gun.\n[quote]\nbutts are never tilted towards the shooter in any case, for a right handed shooter the butt is tilted towards right (cast off). for a left handed shooter, butts are tilted towards the left (cast on). see the above picture for cast off configuration( bottom and far right).\n [/quote]\n\nFriend, this is what i said, you mistakenly took wrong. when we say cast towards the body of the shooter, CAST OFF will be tilted towards the body of the right hand shooter and CAST ON will be tilted towards the body of the left hand shooter. Look in both cases "TOWARDS THE BODY OF THE SHOOTER". You can do this test just by mounting a gun on your left shoulder and right shoulder and there is no need to do any rocket science.\n\nNow the length of pull thing. You have added so many things, so many uncalculated things. You said..\n[quote]Now first joint of your index finger must touch the trigger of the gun\na very common mistake among inexperienced gun fitters, first of all, this bending of arm test is only an informal test (sort of like checking the tyre pressure by pressing it down with a foot, if its firm, tire is probably ok, however it is no concrete evidence of adequate air pressure in the tyre). second, if one has to do this age old test, make sure to measure it up to the middle of the second segment of the index finger, it is never advised to measure it up to the first joint of the index finger. third, it is never advised to put the gun there to measure up, why? cause the weight of the gun will press the biceps down, allowing more length to be squeezed in.\n[/quote]\n\nStarting an argument with the example of cheking air pressure by a foot in a tyre to the measurement of length of pull by gun bedding test is just comparing apples with oranges. As there is no way that by just pressing tyre with foot you can come to an exact numerical reading but by doing a gun bedding test you come to an exact measure.\n\nIn my previous post i said...\n[quote]Length of the pull is greatly dependent on the hight of the shooter, length of his arms, his body weight  and the length of his hands.[/quote]\n\nYour all measurements are regarding these variables arent they?? Now if we want to discuss other specific detais that are for gun smiths i would love to participate. The simple things that i mentioned were within the scope of a shooter not a gunsmith.\n\nLet me explain things again and keep them simple at the same time. Most of the guns are manufectured with a length of pull of 14.5" to 14.75". This length of pull is ideal for a person with 5'' 9" hight 33" arms length and 165lbs weight or that person wears a 40 size suit. When a gun is mounted its receiver shouldn''t be less than 2-3" from shooters face. This is what we get from the shelf. Here, you know there is no need to measure the nose, cheek bone or collar bone of the shooter. When we try to check the fit of the gun we just try to chek if there is a sizeable difference and that can easily done by this simple test that i mentioned in my earlier post. As far as that squeeze of bicep of the shooter with the weight of the gun is considered i leave it to the fellow shooters to do this test and furnish us the measurements that they get. In my humble opinion that squeeze of musseles of bicep will be offset by the squeeze of the musseles of the shoulder when gun will be mounted. \n\nHope you will post the other formal test that you pointed on in your post.\n\nNow another thing, you mentioned in your post that you have customized your gun by adding 2" in its length of pull.\n[quote]p.s. i didnt even hire the services of a gun fitter, i did it myself, had to add two inches to the LOP of my guns, man! what  a difference it makes, makes shooting absolutely reflexive in nature.[/quote]\n\nThis seems very nice work, Will you please give us the total LOP of your gun and your hight, arms length and weight. You can skip length of your nose.... :). As even BAIKALS don''t come with a LOP less than 14", your addition of 2" to any normal gun will end up with a gun with at least 16" LOP making it suitable for a person with hight of 6'' 4" or with extra ordinary long arms.\n\nHope this discussion will help us.', 0, 1, '119.152.48.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1517, 36352),

One of the centers of gun-manufacturing is the town of Darra Adam Khel, near Peshawar, which was historically known for manufacturing the Lee Enfield .303; however, the town now produces ordnance including the AK-47, the mini-Kalashnikov, and hand-held firearms, including the James Bond pen gun.\n\nThe North West Frontier Province (NWFP) is the smallest province of Pakistan with rugged and hilly terrain. Pashtun tribal feuds are common and guns are used both for protection and self-defense.\n\nIn the rural society Swat, the gun culture arose in part out of the traditional antagonism between a man and his tarbur (father''s brother''s son). According to Charles Lindholm:\n\n“ The pervasive hostility between the sons of brothers led to the development of a network of alliances within every village that divided it across lineages into two approximately equal parties, called dulla. Every man belonged to the dulla opposite that of his tarbur. This division ramified throughout the (Swat) valley, so that all of the nearly one million inhabitants visualized themselves as members of one of two eternally warring parties. ” \n\nOld customs and cultural norms also promote the gun culture. In NWFP, where the strong and tough Pashtuns reside, carrying a gun or a Klashinkov is a sign of honour and respect. A gun is also considered to be the jewel of a man in N.W.F.P., thus the social necessity emerging as an intimidating component of provincial culture.\n\nPakistani citizens and special category of foreigners can legally own firearms. A license is required to purchase a firearm which involves payment of fees, a processing time ranging from a few days to months and registration of the firearm with the local authorities. Present laws allow ownership of handguns of any caliber (at one time this was restricted up to the .38). However, rifles above the .22 caliber are prohibited (excluding those which were bought before this restriction was imposed). Shotguns above 12 gauge are not allowed. A person may keep a firearm at his/her place of residence, in one''s vehicle and concealed on person; public display is prohibited (though this law is honored more in the breach than in the observance, especially outside urban areas and in particular by private bodyguards of politicians). Special permits are required for carrying firearms during times when local authorities impose restriction on public gatherings to preempt civil unrest or protests that can turn ugly. In large cities, facilities exist for gun enthusiasts to practice shooting on targets, etc.\n\nSource:-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_culture_in_Pakistan', 0, 1, '119.153.1.224', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1538, 36609),

To mount an assault on an enemy-held mountaintop is often suicidal. Because of the lack of oxygen, attacking soldiers can climb only about five meters before they have to stop to catch their breath. If you let bare skin touch steel for more than 15 seconds—a finger on a trigger, for example—you risk severe frostbite.\nThe 50-mile-long glacier could not be a more unlikely battlefield. Located at altitudes of 18,000 ft. to 20,000 ft., the area is so inhospitable that when Kashmir was split between India and Pakistan following the war in 1971, peace negotiators did not bother to draw the line through it. Patrols from the two countries skirmished on Siachen in 1982. Since then, Islamabad and New Delhi have decided that vital strategic interests, particularly the control of mountain passes bordering the glacier, are at stake. Today a total of 10,000 Indian and Pakistani troops occupy bases in the area. The high altitude makes it especially hazardous duty for soldiers. Indian officials say as many as 500 Indian troops on the glacier die each year from altitude sickness or in accidents.\n\n\nGathered some pics for you of our brave soldiers at those heights.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/143/46905480.jpg[/img][/url]\nAt 4,200 meters above sea level, a Pakistani Army soldier practices a mountain descent during exercises in the Siachen Glacier region.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/1746/17080322.jpg[/img][/url]\nAn officer sits in front of a fiberglass igloo used as living quarters.

They have also initiated a move to plant trees to preserve nature which is under threat due to climate change, persistent water scarcity and low-intensity of rains.\n\nThe two men are related by blood. They hail from Nabi Bux Palari village, situated near scenic Jhimpir off Keenjhar lake. They are the only literate people in their village and seemingly the icons for their coming generations.\n\nKamal and Hameed of local Palari family used to be hunters of partridges and water birds at the Keenjhar lake area for quite a long time. According to Hameed, they used to hunt about 50 birds (partridges) in a single trip and had also been facilitating visiting hunters.\n\nThey give credit to the survey team of WWF (World Wildlife Fund) Indus for All Programme that visited their village and convinced them about the importance of preserving natural resources such as water, fish, forests and birds. “The words of the visiting WWF official made us think,” says Kamal Palari.\n\nAccording to him, after frequent visits of the WWF team they realized that how much importance the natural resources bear for the local community and why they should help protect nature around their own village. Then the villagers not only formed a community-based organization (CBO) but at the same time a cluster of nine villages became members of the Keenjhar Maroora Welfare and Development Organization.\n\nAfter the formation of the CBO, they took initiatives, particularly the “declaration of a no-hunting zone” in the area, convincing hunters to not kill birds. These two guys are active members of the CBO which had given this idea. Nobody is allowed to go for hunting of any kind of birds or mammals in the jurisdiction of the sanctuary from Jhimpir to Chull (the northern side of Keenjhar lake).\n\nThey took this decision after realizing the fact that the hunting pressure is the main cause of population decline of wild animals. After community involvement, WWF Indus for All Programme’s Keenjhar Site Manager Zahid Jalbani said now there was a significant increase in the number of birds and other animals in the no-hunting zone.\n\nThe availability of partridge groups indicates that now the birds were not facing any threat of hunting, particularly in the no-hunting zone, explained Hameed.\n\nJalbani claims that the CBO has now taken the initiative to plant Eucalyptus and Jatropha in their village. Farmer Field School has been established in which about 30 farmers from different villages have been enrolled to adopt the best practices management model (BMP) with the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) technology.\n\nThrough the BMP model, four farmers have been trained as master trainers and they have established a demo plot for growing vegetables as per IMP technology.', 0, 1, '119.160.54.245', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1520, 37313),

By the way Chang Feng is working under NORINCO. \n\nAs for my experience, i fired 50 rounds in about 20 mins from my CF98, without any jam or misfire, fired at a range of more then 50 meters, having pretty accurate results. Recoil is minimum as you can see in the video, but if you loosen your grip then it will definitely give a big recoil, which you guys can also see in the video as i did loosen my grip a few times.\n\nIts a robust weapon which can fire any type of bullet be it chinese, russian 9mm luger, POF or american. It can fire even DAP rounds. \n\nGuys do keep in mind that CF98 or NP42 has become the standard weapon of the Chinese Army, Police, Hong Kong Police and also as Type-92 of Bangladesh Army, which would mean that this is a pretty good & reliable weapon good as Chinese don''t induct average weapons. The chinese TT is a good example in front of you, which has been in service for decades now and is like by nearly everyone as its a strong and reliable weapon. And today''s CF98 are 8000 round barrel life which is more then enough for ppl who wish to keep it as a SD weapon. \n\nCF98 in Peshawar is for 35K nowadays.

A 270 Win. is more than enough rifle for all Pakistani game, ranging from chinkara to Ibex and Urial.  Frankly hitting power (retained energy) at range between 100-200 yards matter a lot more than muzzle velocity and trajectory. There are many proponents of the relatively flat shooting 22-250, which is essentially a varmint calibre, but they will never tell you how many animals they have lost despite shooting them through and through (aar paar).  Therefore, it is better to be over-gunned  than under-gunned. \n\nIn terms of what available in the market these days, if you are looking for an all rounder rifle, with which you can take everything from chinkara, hogdeer, ibex, urial and wildboar,  your first choice shd be the 270, followed by 30-06, 308 and 7mm. \n\nHowever, in Pakistan, choice of rifle is often dictated by the choice of ammo available. Before you finalise your rifle, I would suggest you look for ammo - 130 grain soft nose for 270 Win, 150-168grain soft nose for 30-06, 140-145 grain soft nose for 7mm and 150-165 grain for 308. \n\nOnce you find a good batch of relatively fresh bullets in this weight range, buy abt 200 of them. Make them sure that they are from the same batch and the same weight and the same brand. Different bullets have different points of impact. For example, a 130 grain 270Win bullet made by Prvi Partizan might hit dead on at 200 yards through your rifle, but the same bullet made by Winchester may hit an inch higher. \n\nIdeally speaking, you should first buy your rifle and scope then shoot 5 shot groups of all different brands and weights available for you calibre to see which ones group the best at say 200 yards. For this exercise your rifle just needs to be bore sighted, and hitting the bull''s eye since you are interested in seeing which bullet your rifle prefers the most. Allow your rifle to cool down between the groups, as hot  barrels behave differently than cold ones, and may not give you a true group. \n\nOnce you have found the bullet your rifle likes the most, go out an buy hundreds of those, zero your scope on them, and then use those bullets for the rest of your rifle. \n\nHowever, this is in an ideal situation. In a country like Pakistan,. where you dont have much choice, you must first find a rifle you like, then look for suitable ammo. Once you have found the ammo, buy a large enough batch of it, say 200 bullets at least, then get your rifle and scope, zero your rifle.  And then hunt happily ever after.\n\nAvoid the temptation to collect a motley crew of bullets, as this will do you no good. It is much better to be skilled with one rifle and one bullet, than to be unskilled with several. Thoise who shoot one rifle and one bullet often have their freezers stocked, and their walls adorned with trophies.

They are often used in handgun and airgun competitions. A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target to the favor of the shooter. Because the flat nosed bullet is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used only in revolvers or in specially-designed semi-automatic pistols.\n\nWadcutters are typically made from lead; as such, deposition of lead into the rifling grooves of barrels, and into the forcing cones of revolvers, limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900 ft/s; as a few shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the forcing cone, introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup. Either a mechanical lead removing tool (i.e., a Lewis Lead Remover or a generic equivalent) and/or chemical removal techniques may be used to remove the lead build-up from shooting wadcutters at too high a velocity.\n\nWadcutters can be loaded flush with the brass case, such as seen in the accompanying picture, or they may also be set to extend out of the brass case, depending on what provides the most accuracy, the desired powder capacity of the case, or other desired criteria. Both varieties of wadcutters (flush, or extending out of the case) are commercially available. Although primarily intended for target practice, wadcutters are also sometimes used for close-in self-defense and hunting, because their sharp edges and close-range accuracy increase lethality. (See Keith bullet for more on these wadcutter and semiwadcutter applications involving self-defense and hunting applications.)\n\nTarget airguns used for 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol competitions generally shoot wadcutter pellets at velocities around 175 m/s (574 ft/s). The use of wadcutter match diabolo pellets is nearly universal in airgun target shooting where often paper targets are used.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/9913/96714573.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/6972/20307791.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '116.71.173.149', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1588, 37991),

Just like this:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7568/83097355.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nTighten them into place using 1/2 turns at the time so that they sit solid and level as best as is possible, i.e., the downward pressure is as equal as possible. At this stage don''t tighten them fully as you might want to slide them up and down a little.\n\nNow take scope and place it on top of the open rifle mounts.\n\nPosition the eyepiece by sliding the scope back and forwards. You may have to move one or both rings to get this right. \nPosition the rings so the scopes eyepiece will be the correct distance from your shooting eye when the gun is held naturally. \nThis is usually between 2 and 3 inches from the eyepiece lens, but it is the spot at which the image in the scope appears as full and bright as it gets. \nTo see what this looks like, move your head back and forth along the stock, as you look through the scope with both eyes open. \nThen, position your head on the cheek piece where you want it to be and move the scope back and forth until the image appears bright and full. \nMake sure the windage and elevation turrets are positioned correctly - Elevation (up and down cross-hair adjustment) on top and windage (left and right movement) to the right.\n\n\nThen put the top mount brackets on and tighten - Tighten them until the scope is held secure but can still be rotated with your hand (Not very tight)\n\n\nNow align the vertical cross-hair with both eyes open and the gun held naturally to your shoulder. Rotate the scope until the vertical reticle seems to bisect the gun perfectly. \nOK? Yes - Now tighten the base of the rings securely to the gun top (NOT the top rings yet, that''s next)\n\n\nNow it''s time to tighten the top cap rings. You need to take this carefully and slowly as it''s a critical step. It''s not hard, just be patient. \nTighten each screw partially, then move to the next one and go around the pattern of screws many times, rather than tightening each screw all the way on the first try. \nYou will put even tension on the caps and be less likely to dent the scope tube this way. \nIf there are two screws on the side of the ring, tighten only one, then tighten the one on the opposite corner of the other side of the cap (see graphic below). \nLeave the other two screws for the moment and tighten two screws on the other ring next. \nThen come back to mount one and tighten the two screws you left loose. \nThen back to the other ring and keep rotating until the scope is secure. \nIt takes less tightening that you might think. They need be firm not as tight as possible. Err on the side of too loose, rather than too tight.\n\nThis is the order of screw tighten in the case of a double screw mount. If you have a single screw each side then do it as 1 - 4 - 5 - 8 (you get my drift I hope) basically you want pressure to be as even as possible throughout the process and not risk damaging the tube of having uneven pressure on one side that will make zeroing more difficult.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2184/92231829.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '115.186.142.7', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1585, 37994),

Also make sure that anyone else with you has them on too. \n\nIf you don''t have safety glasses get some! If you don''t and are impatient to get going (sighs) then try this method but extended distance to 30 feet or more.\n\nNow it''s time to zero the scope for shooting:\n\n1- Adopt your standard prone/lie down shooting position. \n\nProne is the best way as if you test shoot from standing or kneeling positions you waver more and it''s harder to do a "true test". \n\nMake sure your windage and elevation turrets are ready for adjusting i.e., caps removed.\n\n2- Draw 1 or 2 small dots on a piece of cardboard about 6.5cm apart vertically.  \nThere''s no precision to this step. You just want enough room on the target so no shots are lost. At 10 feet, they can''t go too far. \n\nIf your scope has parallax adjustment, adjust it as close as it will go. If it has variable power, adjust it as low as it will go. \n\nThe aim point will probably be a little fuzzy at this distance. \n\nAim at the top dot. Expect your first shot to be as much below the dot as the center of your scope is above your gun barrel. If that''s 7cm then that''s how low the shot should go. \n\nThen take another shot using the same aim point - this is to confirm the aim point as good as you can.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9521/30123263.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n3 - Keeping in mind where your first 2 shots went adjust the windage and elevation turrets . \nAt only 10 feet this will take a lot of clicks. \n\nYour objective is to get your shots in line with the lower target dot. Keep shooting and adjusting until you get there.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6364/15008467.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n4- Now it''s time to get serious. Move the target out to 10 metres (33 or so feet) \nTake more shots and see where they land. \n\nIn this example they went off to the right a bit too much so adjust the windage (left and right) dial and few clicks - not so many are needed at this longer distance. Experiment.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1134/68380807.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n5- One you''re aligned correctly at the horizontal level at 10 metres it''s time to get the vertical zero sorted out. \nYour shot pattern should look like this now (see point 4) \n\nAt longer distance your shots will rise but stay in line side to side.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9489/80307909.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n6- Now move the target out to 20-30 metres and shoot 5 shots. \nIf you know what your standard - average shooting range is then set your target at that range. \n\nThey should all be pretty close on the top dot now. \n\nMake any small tweaks to bring them closer to the dot and you''re about done.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/8518/52915667.jpg[/img][/url]\n \nYou now know that at less than this range your shots will fall lower than the aim point so you can mentally adjust your aim to compensate. \n\nAlso, at about 5 metres further away the pellet will again fall lower than the aim point, so you can adjust again. \nIt''s trial and error basically but with testing you''ll get to where you need to be and be able to trust that your shots will go where it says they will!

You have to get a guest pass in order to enter Home Dept. Since the line was very long I got hold of a Police Constable and told him I want to enter. He refused first, but after some haggling allowed me to enter the building with a promise to give him some "Chai Pani" on my way back.\r\n\r\nOnce I entered, there was 3 or 4 other policeman near the entrance to the HOme Dept. They also asked me for a pass, but after talking with them, they also asked for Chai Pani. Promised them also for something on my way back.\r\n\r\nWent straight to the "Computerized Licences Dept". Quite straightforward from that moment on. First showed one guy copies of my original and photocopied Gas bill, PTCL bill and NTN Certificate. He looked at them (all in my own name) and told me to come along with him to the Section Officer Arms Mr.Peerbux for approval. He took me to his room which was filled with people. Anyways, managed to get approval within 10 mins and the SO signed on one of my docs for approval.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the person told me to go fill the Challan in National Bank Income tax branch which is close to HD. Got the form (photocopied from outside) and then attached my NIC copy and paid the Challan for Rs.4500/.\r\n\r\nAfter paying the challan then went again to HD and the person made me the Token (Just like nadra). After taking the TOKEN i went home because they was a lot of rush and I had to get to work soon.\r\n\r\nNext day I came to HD on Friday around 9.45 am. There was no one there except me. Took the photo and the other guy took out a printout of my details (just like passport printout) and then gave me a Verification form (Police) which is addressed to the SSP Verification branch/Special branch. This I asked is the Arambagh PS branch. Now the verification seems quite long. I hope to get some source to do the verification for me and will let u all know.\r\nAll in all a ONe day process if u have all yr docs.\r\nSD 26[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nThank you brother for the information.', 1, 1, '113.203.143.112', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Once a Batair (fighting quail) runs away from the Maidaan (quail fighting arena) then it loses its heart and cannot face even a weaker quail to fight, hence is called “Bhagail Marraz”. Usually such quails are slaughtered by the Batair Baaz (quail betters) for a delicious roast.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2683/69534939.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nSerious injuries are far more common among hockey players, and birds have no teeth to get knocked out. \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/3034/57300720.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5185/59220638.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/9127/38158861.jpg[/img][/url]\nWatching the actual fight often consists of seeing the two birds strut about for a minute then go into a spinning ball of feathers.

In theory it''s not that difficult but in reality and for the first time does get a few curse words out of you that you didn''t realize you knew ;)\n\nTo help future owners of the Mark III, I''m adding a few links that will prove invaluable should you decided to do a disassemble clean. I personally don''t think it''s required more than once every 2000 rounds. \n\n\n[url]http://guntalk-online.com/fsprocedures.htm[/url]\n[url]http://www.guntalk-online.com/detailstrip.htm[/url]\n[url]http://guntalk-online.com/TroubleshootingPage.htm[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYHJm2P4kP0[/url]', 0, 1, '119.154.56.230', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1577, 38171),

Two tone. slide not completely black, rather gives more sportish looks.. its dark maroon/black mix, sort of some alloy made slide, have polished barrel bore, shallow rifling , like that we find in colt 1911 barrel, 6-groove right hand twist. \nSights vs, barrel''s center bore line vs slide fitting alignment is 100% perfect and upto the mark.. shoots straight where you aim at. doesnt exhibit any sort of rust on it after use of 1 year.\nInstalled hogue full wrap around grips for 3000rs, pistol was tagged as 25K where as i had special links through another person with the shopkeeper after a lil hanky panky i paid only 16500rs for it and took it to home. \nThe gun is used on range once and our own piece of land several times where we have shot on paper targets with it using norinco/POF/american eagle FMJs and federal JHPs. To this day it has never failed to feed a round or failed on extration, being very honest with this pakmade weapon.\nHave fired more than 600 rounds through it, along better desi rounds.. yes it has misfired a couple of times with desi rounds, not pistols fault rather the round was hit harder on the primer than it ever could ideally, and sometimes a dumb primer takes a DA trigger pull to fire after once it has misfired but thats all with desi ammo. Otherwise it has never misfired on chinese or POF ammo. \nBarrel is still going good, i was a lil upset when on day 2nd i found its rifling to be so shallower but after this much of a drag, i would say apprently the rifling is still clean and clear as it was on day 1. But again thats only 600 rounds, i hope it to last upto 4000 rounds but thats again my guess. \nIts acurate upto 20 meters. With my amateur skills i can manage to deliver a couple of rounds within 8 inch circle before i get fatigued due to continous firing.. i am not an expert on trigger control yet but if this thing goes on good i think ill love to master a beretta 92FS on it before buying an italian one which ofcourse i currently dont afford. Over all i am pretty damn sure that with a quick draw from holster and simple point shooting this gun will deliver the bolt to the chest within 15 meters. So i rate it as my SD gun nonetheless.\nYes - firepin once got broken, after only a box of 50 rounds, replaced it and now its going like smoothest butter gun.. shoots everytime on demand. After every shooting tour i prefer to check its internals more specifically the 1- locking block and 2- the slide corners where the locking block hits upon blow back action. To my goodness they are as good as they were on the day 1.\nI can bet my life on this gun because i know it will send a bolt right where i will point it and whenever i demand it to do so. Yes its a little heavier like 1 KG approx a few like 50 grams more than an original FS. I trust this weapon and feel confident with it. Usually I carry it with concealed carry permit inside Punjab having NPB Lahore based license. \n\nPFA pictures below with and without Hogue wrap arounds.\nand for the target video click below:\nVideo Link:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7Grt3wkG8[/url]\n\nHappy shooting and safe carry.. ;)\nRegards,\nM.

You cannot leave your barrel un-cleaned and relubed, immediately after a shooting session.\n\n-You cannot trust your fire pin and extractor in NIB clone gun, always perform a remake by an expert gunsmith who have mastered 92''s. Believe me there are such good gunsmith available who have a command on this weapon atleast. Same story goes with the trigger, you might like to have a trigger job done too by such a gunsmith (but do this sometime later like after firing 500+ rounds) - just for the sake of break-in period. Un-refined firearms do require more break-in time.\n\nBefore buying, you really need to verify these points, because they vary... in piece to piece within the same brand/manufacturer''s collection:\n\n- slide to frame fit, the weapon should not rattle when shaked vigorously (take magazine out before doing that)\n\n- Locking block''s balance with respect to Slide recesses where it fits in, when gun is in full lockup, i.e. when slide is fully forward. Imbalanced pistol in this aspect will break the locking block or crack the slide recesses very soon.\n\n- barrel rifling and feed ramp (modern shallow type rifling is looked for here in this regard) and a good polished smooth feed ramp.\n\n- the most important of all is, barrel to slide fit. When pistol is in lock-up (slide fully forward) hold your muzzle and try to move your barrel horizontally. It should not move or atleast it should seem to avoid any such movement(if not rock solid in this position)\n\n-also keeping above point in mind next thing you should do is, rack the slide once, (DOUBLE CHECK MAGAZINE IS OUT AND WEAPON IS EMPTY CHAMBERED), look through the muzzle by keeping it 2 feet away from your eye, such that you manage to exactly align the front sight with the rare sight. Keep holding in that position, verify visually, the barrel / the slide / the sights MUST BE in perfect alignment and straightness. Here at this point, if there''s any manufacturing/Fitting flaw, it will be disclosed to you. SUCH A PISTOL will never shoot good, infact such a pistol is not to be labelled as a true firearm indeed. This flaw is very much likely to occur in every 2/3 pistols that are born in our LOCAL factories. \n\nI hope by looking at all above aspects with clear mind and great detail.. you can pick a nice piece. It will serve you well and you will enjoy shooting it.\n\n\n\n******* UPDATE - Practice time *******\n\nMy Sunday Shoot (25th Oct, 09)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLocation: private land enclosure, Sadhoke GT road, Pakistan.\nWeapon: Beretta 92FS clone\nAmmo: Local factory reloads w/ Federal 9mm cases\nTarget Distance: 12 meters approx +/- 1 meter\nTarget type: Home made unprofessional type/white chart paper wrapped on dead tree trunk\nNumber of Shots: 30approx\nShooter: Myself \nIssues: Last round from the mag FTE reason might be under powered as its local reloaded ammo.\n\nVideo Link:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxbBl-CTjTg[/url]\n\nTarget Later on:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/sat0i.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/savvr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/sax_A.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.29.248', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1616, 38398),

So it''s always a challenge for him to walk uphill. In Feb 2009, Mr. Bond shot a Sindh Ibex & Blandford Urial for which he had to walk all the way to the top of two hilly habitats and undertook 8 hours of walk for each of his hunts. During these long & hard walks, he felt so breathless and suffered so much pain in his knees any other macho man would have given up. But I salute Mr. Bond that under these odd physical conditions and quite a hot weather he accomplished his hunts. At home, the Dallas Safari Club awarded him the best hunter of the year.

Our enemies are using our money against us. We are buying their arms for money and they are using it against our Muslim brothers in Palestine, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Iraq etc everywhere in the world. The are using our resources for further research and development and creating more lethal weapons which will ultimately used against us. So my request is that, pls. pls. pls. start using our local arms also and support our local weapon and arm manufacturing industry only in this way we can help them to buy new machinery and start research and development. In this way we will be able to compete in international market in arm manufacturing.

I hope members would find this article interesting and helpful.\n\nCC.\n\nIf you''ve just bought a fancy new rifle and you need a new scope to put on top of your rifle, you need to understand all the different models and styles available today.\n\nThe first thing to understand is how a scope works. A scope is a metal tube that encases a series of coated glass lenses. This allows the target to be viewed on the same focal plane as the sights. Rather than trying to keep the rear sight and front sight and the target all in focus all at the same time, everything is in focus together and if you add magnification, you have an almost perfect system for sighting.\n\nHere are some of the terms used by the optic industry and what they mean for you.\n\nSpecifications of a scope are usually stated as: 3-9x40mm, or 4x32mm, or some variation of numbers. The numbers before the ''x'' refer to the magnification and this can be a fixed number (ie, 4), or a variable number, (ie. 3-9). Whatever that number, it means your target will appear that many times closer than it actually is. The number after the ''x'' refers to the diameter of the objective lens, expressed in millimeters.\n\nScopes are either fixed-power or variable-power. Fixed power scopes are permanently set at a given level of magnification, but variable-power scopes allow for adjustment. In the past, variable-power scopes weren''t as durable as fixed-power scopes and gained a bad reputation from a lot of hunters. But, today there are so many advances in technology as well as exhaustive training by manufacturers, that most variable-power scopes are just as rugged as fixed-power scopes. It is hard to beat the versatility of of a variable-scope. Variables in the 2-7x, 3-9x, or 2.5-10x are most popular for hunting big game and fixed powers of  4x or 6x are more popular with hunters who still prefer the simplicity of a fixed-power scope.\n\nVariable power scope allows you to crank up the magnification to a higher setting if you find yourself needing to take a long shot and yet keep the scope on a low setting whenever you encounter game up close or moving. \n\nWhen it comes to the size of the scope''s objective lens, the bigger it is, the larger the field of view FOV) will be at any given magnification setting.  Depending on the coatings on the lenses, the brighter the scope will be. This is a major advantage scopes have over iron sights.\n\nHigher quality scopes are able to gather all available light into the scope and utilizes it in such a way that you can actually see better during low-light conditions than with the naked eye. The key here, is high-quality! What makes a high quality scope? Special coatings are applied to the surface of a lens to reduce glare and the amount of light lost during the transmission of the target to your eye. The quality, number and  position of these coatings determine how much light is transmitted. Here are your options:\n\ncoated – a single layer is applied to at least one lens\nfully coated – a single layer is applied to all air-to-glass surfaces\nmulti-coated – multiple layers are applied to a least one lens surface\nfully multi-coated – multiple layers are applied to all air-to-glass surfaces\n\nThe more coatings,  usually translates into a more expensive and high-quality scope. Most of the high-quality scopes are also waterproof, fogproof, and shockproof. These are not cheap!

Located in the southwest-northwest of Skardu, at 4,300 meters (14,000 feet) its is the natural habitat of the Great Himalayan Brown Bear (equivalent to American Grizzly Bear). The undulating slopes of Deosai Plateau are also comprised of the shy and pretty Himalayan Marmots along with several summer swamps where mosquitoes breed, a unique replica of Arctic Tundra with many interesting alpine and Arctic plant forms. Most species bloom at the same time - during the brief summer of July and August when, addition to sedges, grasses and dwarf willows, many plants grow in tufts and some form compact cushions.\n\nThis plateau is approximately 100 sq miles in area. Since Deosai is a tree-less plateau (located above tree line) and its composed of small undulating hills with rolling grassland, and if you see a bear, it cant escape and you can see it walk away for miles & miles. \n\nThis bear is on the list of protected species of the WWF and it is taken very good care by a very organized community based program. It''s hunting is totally forbidden ... and as per the last survey I read long time ago their surving number was just 22 bears the current population is around 50 and I hope and pray it thrives by leaps & bounds ! ... so our grand children may see this cute animal ! \n\nSo my dear friends .. just imagine .. if something goes wrong ... and if all of these 22 (or so) number of bears are killed, dead with desease or God fobid wiped out from the face of the Earth due to any other reason ... we''ll never get it back & it will be an irreparable loss for Pakistan ! \n\nSO LET''S GO ALL TOGETHER AND SHOOT THESE BEARS .... but with our cameras only ! ... it''ll be a great fun !\n\n[img]http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss46/pakistanguides/HimalaynBrownBearDeosai.jpg[/img]\n\nLook how cute this guy looks !

You have to get a guest pass in order to enter Home Dept. Since the line was very long I got hold of a Police Constable and told him I want to enter. He refused first, but after some haggling allowed me to enter the building with a promise to give him some "Chai Pani" on my way back.\r\n\r\nOnce I entered, there was 3 or 4 other policeman near the entrance to the HOme Dept. They also asked me for a pass, but after talking with them, they also asked for Chai Pani. Promised them also for something on my way back.\r\n\r\nWent straight to the "Computerized Licences Dept". Quite straightforward from that moment on. First showed one guy copies of my original and photocopied Gas bill, PTCL bill and NTN Certificate. He looked at them (all in my own name) and told me to come along with him to the Section Officer Arms Mr.Peerbux for approval. He took me to his room which was filled with people. Anyways, managed to get approval within 10 mins and the SO signed on one of my docs for approval.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the person told me to go fill the Challan in National Bank Income tax branch which is close to HD. Got the form (photocopied from outside) and then attached my NIC copy and paid the Challan for Rs.4500/.\r\n\r\nAfter paying the challan then went again to HD and the person made me the Token (Just like nadra). After taking the TOKEN i went home because they was a lot of rush and I had to get to work soon.\r\n\r\nNext day I came to HD on Friday around 9.45 am. There was no one there except me. Took the photo and the other guy took out a printout of my details (just like passport printout) and then gave me a Verification form (Police) which is addressed to the SSP Verification branch/Special branch. This I asked is the Arambagh PS branch. Now the verification seems quite long. I hope to get some source to do the verification for me and will let u all know.\r\nAll in all a ONe day process if u have all yr docs.\r\nSD 26', 1, 0, '182.178.110.49', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Could shoot a fly off a horses backside from 50 yards! I use logun penetrators (pellets) and they seem to be spot on with this gun. They fly incredibly straight, would recomend them to anyone with an enigma. I do alot of vermin control - mostly squirels, pigeons and rabbits, and this gun allows me to hit and kill 99.9% of everything i shoot. Make sure you get a decent silencer for it. The one that comes with it is rubbish. I have been using a parker hale which is designed for live fire rifles. it is good, but its nothing compared to the logun silencer which makes my gun sound like a light breath of air.

Surprisingly, it varies from US$ 5 per hunt to US$ 25 per year (for all hunts) ... whereas the residents of other states this fee is more and for foreigners it is even more .. it goes over several thousand dollars ... and so on ! \n\nTo enable such a luxury .. a small group of people  have to work hard to make a conservancy & then within a short period of 3 to 5 years the results are great !\n\nThe problem with Pakstanis is that most of us want to become Robin Hoods without getting any training or learning the thics of hunting and we would want to shoot anything which moves in wilderness ... regardless of what it is and we all want to shoot it free of cost & in big numbers so the result is obvious ... we lack Shikar every where in pakistan except for the protected areas !', 0, 1, '119.153.54.51', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1398, 39838),

Too many parents forget about gun safety though. \nHaving a gun in your home, especially if it is not stored properly, can be a significant risk factor for injury and death in children. In fact, firearm related injuries are a leading cause of death in children, and include deaths from unintentional injuries, homicide and suicide.\nBetween 1994 and 1998, 6,287 children committed suicide with a firearm and an additional 1,896 children were killed by unintentional gun injuries in the United States. All together, 18,297 children under age 19 died from a gun-related injury during these years, according to CDC National Injury Mortality Statistics. \nAn even larger number of children are hurt by nonfatal gun-related injuries. Although gun-related injuries peak in adolescence, they can affect infants and younger children too. Younger children are most likely to be injured, either shooting themselves or a playmate, after playing with a gun that they have found in the home, not realizing that the gun is real or that it is loaded. \nIt is estimated that guns are in half of all homes in the United States. Although most of these guns are purchased for safety reasons, it is important to keep in mind that a firearm in the home is much more likely (up to 43 times more likely in some reports) to kill or injure a family member or friend than an intruder. \nBecause of the number of injuries from guns, which many say has reached epidemic levels, programs have been developed to educate parents and children about gun safety. These include the Eddie Eagle gun safety program from the National Rifle Association, which educates children who find a gun to ''Stop! Don''t Touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult.'' The American Academy of Pediatrics also has a ''Keep Your Family Safe from Firearm Injury'' program that educates parents about gun safety and advises ''the safest thing is to not have a gun in your home, especially not a handgun.''\nMany parents incorrectly assume that their child is educated about gun safety, can tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun, and would know not to handle a real gun. A study in the June 2001 issue of Pediatrics showed this to not be true. \nIn this study, ''Seeing is Believing: What Do Boys Do When They Find a Real Gun?,'' 29 groups of boys aged 8-12 years were observed in a room where a gun was hidden. Many of the children found and handled the gun, and half of the children actually pulled the trigger. \nMost of the children that handled the found gun and pulled the trigger had previously received gun safety education. This study helps to prove that to keep your children safe and prevent firearm related injuries, it is important to restrict their access to guns, either by not having a gun in the home or by storing it properly. \nProper storage of a gun includes keeping the gun in a gun safe, lock box, or a locked cabinet or drawer. The gun should also be stored unloaded with the bullets locked separately. \nA gun put in a shoe box on the top shelf of a closet is not considered to be a safely stored gun. Neither is a gun placed under the mattress or somewhere else where your child ''would never look for it.'' Children are naturally curious and if a gun is not stored properly, there is a good chance that a child may find it and injure himself or someone else. \nOther steps you can take to ensure gun safety include: \n·	Use a gun lock or trigger lock. \n·	Make sure that your children do not have access to the keys used to lock your guns and bullets. \n·	Teach your children to not handle guns without adult supervision. \n·	Avoid letting your children play with realistic toy guns and nonpowder firearms, such as pellet guns, air guns, air rifles and BB guns.\nEven if you don''t have a gun in your own home, it is important to educate your children about firearm safety in case they discover a gun outside the home or in the homes of their friends. They should know the 4 steps of the Eddie Eagle gun safety program, including: \n·	Stop! \n·	Don''t Touch. \n·	Leave the Area. \n·	Tell an Adult.\nYou should also discuss gun safety with other parents or family members if your child spends time in their homes. It is not enough to assume that if they do have guns in the house, then they have them stored properly. \nAs the American Academy of Pediatrics states in their book, ''Injury Prevention and Control for Children and Youth,'' the ''risks of hangun ownership outweight the benefits.'' If you have children in your house, then consider getting rid of your guns. If you must have a gun in the house, then at least learn to store it properly. \nIf you do decide that you want to get rid of your guns to protect your children, you can look to see if a gun ''buy back'' type program is available in your area. Or call the non-emergency number of your local police department and ask if they will pick it up. \nMany communities also have free gun lock and/or trigger lock give away programs.', 0, 1, '116.71.25.140', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 843, 40229),
(34405, 16, 98, 'Rizshu', 807, '', 1247397644, 'Guns go bang. That''s what they do. They are used safely millions upon millions of times every year, but the potential for injury and death is always there. For this reason, we need to follow basic safety rules at all times when handling firearms, including handguns like revolvers and pistols, rifles, shotguns, muzzleloaders, air guns, etc.\n\n[b]1. Assume That Any Gun, at Any Time, is Loaded.[/b] \n\nWhen someone tells you a gun is not loaded, that''s fine - but don''t believe it until you see it for yourself. If you offend your buddy by checking a gun after he''s told you it''s unloaded, then so be it. Better safe than dead. Make it a habit to check no matter what. This is a very important habit to get into.\n\n[b]2. Always Point a Gun in a Safe Direction.[/b] \n\nThis one should be self-explanatory. It is the bedrock of all gun safety, and is the most important rule. Another way to say it, which Dad taught me many years ago, is, "Never point a gun at anything you''re not willing to shoot."\n\n[b]3. Keep Your Finger off the Trigger.[/b]\n\nThis is something I see way too often. Some doofus will have his or her finger on the trigger of a gun they are simply carrying, looking down the sights of, etc. Don''t do it! Keep that finger outside the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot, and after shooting, move it back out of the trigger guard. And please don''t be offended that I used the term "doofus" if you have been guilty of this, because I have been a doofus before, too.\n\n[b]4. Know What You''re Shooting at.[/b]\n\nYour target is whatever you have decided to shoot. And - this is extremely important - it must be a conscious decision when you shoot something. Don''t get lax about this. You need to know what you are going to shoot at, what is between you and it, and what is beyond it. Pay attention.\n\n[b]5. Be Familiar With Your Gun.[/b]\n\nTake the time to learn about the operation and features of the firearm you are planning to use. The time to learn this is not while you are shooting... that is when you need to be learning about grip, shooting positions, trigger control, etc. When you step up to the firing line, you should already know how to operate the gun you''ll be shooting.\n\n[b]6. Don''t Shoot at Hard Surfaces (Including Water).[/b]\n\nWater might not seem like a hard surface, but its density makes it pretty dangerous. It has a tendency to allow bullets and shotgun shot to ricochet (glance off) and fly off in an unintended direction. Not good. Hard surfaces like metal, rocks, and hard wood can do this too - and they can even send the projectile back to the shooter, which can be hard on a feller, because shooting oneself, even indirectly, can be a pretty nasty experience.\n\n[b]7. Don''t Rely on a Safety Mechanism.[/b]\n\nMany guns have a safety device to prevent the gun from firing. These are often reliable, but not always. And some guns have even been known to fire when the safety is released, most notably Remington bolt-action centerfire rifles, which naturally leads to the conclusion that safety mechanisms are often useful, but not completely reliable. Use the safety, but don''t count on it! Continue to follow the number one rule: Always keep the gun pointed somewhere safe.\n\n[b]8. Load Your Gun When You Need to.[/b]\n\nSome, including the NRA, will tell you to keep every gun unloaded until you''re ready to fire it. This is not a sensible rule, because guns used for hunting and defense purposes will be needed in a hurry whenever they are needed, and there is no time to be messing around loading your gun when you need it to save your life, or to take the game you''re hunting. If you need your gun for defense from human or animal attackers and it''s not loaded, it becomes a liability rather than a benefit, and your safety goes down the tubes. So load your gun, and handle it responsibly.\n\n[b]9. Use the Right Ammo.[/b]\n\nMake certain the ammunition you''re using is right for your gun. Just because the ammo can be crammed into the gun, don''t assume it''s the right stuff for that popper. The groceries you feed your gun need to match up with the gun''s design and strength factors. This is usually marked on the gun. If you have any doubt, contact the gun''s manufacturer or a qualified gunsmith.\n\n[b]10. Pay Attention![/b]\n\nIt''s easy to get distracted when you''re having fun, and target shooting can be a lot of fun, especially if you''re enjoying it with friends and family. Take extra care to follow safe gun handling rules, and don''t be afraid to correct others when you see them improperly handling firearms. They may not like it, but all participants must follow gun safety rules if everyone is to come home safe and sound.

This high twist rate produces a very fast spin on the bullet when it leaves the barrel to stabilize it during it''s flight in the air. Lighter bullets require higher spin for stability. A 5.56 Nato fired from a M4/M14 usually spins at around 180,000 rpm. A barrel with a very high twist rate, like 1:7 has a shorter barrel life and requires early replacement.\n\nMost rifles have a twist rate of 1:9, an AK has a twist rate of 1:9, so does G3.\n \nBarrel twist rate is a whole science. There are scientific formulas to compute barrel twist rate. It depends mostly on the Length of the bullet, diameter of the bullet, muzzle velocity, etc.\n\nLocal gun manufacturers only make copies and are not very scientific in their manufacturing, hence they may not be aware of the methods used to compute the required twist rate for their weapons, especially because the twist rate is computed for a specific ammo to be used in a specific weapon, like in military weapons.\n\nThere have been many experts who derived their own formulas to compute barrel twist rate, one very commonly used was derived by Greenhill, known as Greenhill equation to copute barrel twist rate is as under.\n\nT'' = 150 / L'' \n\nwhere the twist and the bullet length are in calibers. Removing bullet diameter from twist and length gives the equation often found: \n\nT = 150 * D^2 / L \n\nThe Greenhill equation includes no term for muzzle velocity, and several sources suggest replacing the 150 with 180 for muzzle velocities over 2800 fps. Increasing muzzle velocity increases bullet spin, and spin provides the stability.

Its both effective and has less recoil and it may help to improve self confidence of the ladies and it doesn''t give out much bang and is easy to control.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nYOU MUST TEACH THEM FIRST THE RULES OF FIREARMS SAFETY AND WHERE POSSIBLE USE DUMMY ROUNDS IN THE TRAINING PROCESS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/quote]\n\n\nSIR JEE....Excellent lecture!

After getting the license there would be entry at NBP and after purchase there would be an entry at DCO Office  which is common for both licences. There are empty pages in computerized licences for these endorsements.  It is not like Card licence where everytime u purchase or change weapon u need a new card.

The Alouette III is the successor to the Alouette II, being larger and having more seating. Originally powered by a Turbomeca Artouste IIIB turboshaft engine, the Alouette III is recognised for its mountain rescue capabilities and adaptability.\n\nThe first version of the Alouette III, the SE 3160 prototype, first flew on 28 February 1959. Production of the SA 316A (SE 3160) began in 1961 and remained in production until 1968, when it was replaced by the SA 316B.\n\nThe Alouette III entered in service with the French Armed forces in 1960. From April 1964-1967, three machines were delivered from France for local assembly in Australia, and were used by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at the Woomera Rocket Range for light passenger and recovery of missile parts after test launches at the Range.\n[b]Served in Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 when 2 planes of the PAF were lost in the war,[/b]and the Portuguese Colonial War, during 60''s and 70''s with large utilization in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea, where it proved its qualities.\nThe SA 316B and the SA 319B both remained in series production up to the early 1980s, when the main production line in France was closed down. However, HAL of India continues to licence-build Alouette IIIs as the Chetak. Versions of the Alouette III were also either licence-built or assembled by IAR in Romania (as the IAR 316), F+W Emmen in Switzerland, and by Fokker and Lichtwerk in the Netherlands.\n[b]Production numbers are as follows:[/b]\n\n    * France: 1453\n    * India: 300+ (Still in production.)\n    * Romania: 230\n    * Switzerland: 60\n\nIn June 2004, the Alouette III was retired from the French Air Force after 32 years of successful service. It will be replaced by the Eurocopter EC 355 Ecureuil 2. In the same year, the Swiss Armed Forces announced the retirement of the Alouette III, from the front line by 2006, and entirely by 2010. Venezuelan Air forces retired their Alouette IIIs in the late 90s.\nOn 21 September 2007 after 44 years of successful service, in which hundreds of lives were saved, the Alouette III was retired from the Irish Air Corps.\n\n[b]Specifications (SA 316B)[/b]\n\nThis aircraft article is missing some (or all) of its specifications.

Modern gun manufecturing industry is quite aware of this and has devised many state of the art triggers, hammers, firing pin blocks, strikers to get rid of an unwnted accidental firing, either by gun drop or by slip of hammer. All modern gun manufecturers put their arms to different tests and gun drop test is a must. Let me explain few safety features regarding our topic that are a regular part of all reputable modern guns. \n\n[b]FIRING PIN BLOCK:[/b]\n\nAll modern reputable handguns have this feature. When gun is loaded firing pin is blocked by a plate, bar or another pin so firing pin cannot hit the primer unless the trigger is pulled. This firing pin block acts like the shutter of a camera and gives way to the pin when it is needed.\n\n[b]HALF COCKED STRIKER:[/b]\n \nThis is a modern feature popularised by the GLOCK although we find this feature on other guns aswel. In this action there is no hammer to hit the primer through firing pin rather firing pin is striked by a tension spring. This spring does not get fully cocked by loading the pistol rather get half cocked. It gets fully cocked when trigger is pulled. So, there is no question of firing by the drop of gun as firing pin does not have the required energy to ignite the primer. This is the reason why GLOCK and SIGMA have heavy triggers. \n\n[b]TRIGGER BLOCKS:[/b]\n\nMostly guns come with different type of blocks those prevent trigger to get slipped unless hand gun is properly held in the hand and trigger is pulled. In all 1911''s there is a trigger lock at the back of the grip just under the hammer guard, this lock prevents the pull of the trigger unless this guard is pressed by the palm of the shooter. This guard is pressed by the shooter''s palm when shooter holds the gun in his/her natural grip. Other guns like GLOCK come with a towpart trigger that serves the same purpose but in a different way.\n\n[b]DECOCKER:[/b]\n\nThese guns come with a decocker that just drop the hammer without hitting the firing pin so gun can be carried chambered but with dropped hammer leaving any chance for firing by the dropping of the gun.\n\nSo, there are many safety features available to prevent any accident, and combination of these features on almost all reputable guns make them pretty safe but there is no safety that can sbstitute the safety of the unchambered gun in the hands of a careful shooter.', 0, 1, '203.135.49.4', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1686, 40881),

I dont think that there is any issue with any of the First Tier brands. I do carry a Glock 26 and i have never thought about this scenario. If you go through the whole thread below you can clearly read that if right circumstances were given, even a Glock can fire while dropped.\n\n[i]After far too long a time it has dawned on me that the mistake in this thread has been to consider the "trigger" safety in isolation. We should have considered the safeties of the Glock as a system.[/i]\n\n[i]First, the Glock is intended to fire if you pull the trigger with a round in the chamber. The weight and length of trigger pull adds a small margin of safety against a "twitch" of the trigger finger but not much in comparison to a cocked and unlocked 1911. It has no where near the margin of a revolver in double action mode. If your finger is on the trigger when you are startled enough you are very likely to pull the trigger hard enough to fire the piece. To this extent, as many keep saying, the primary safety is between your ears. Handle the gun sensibly and you won''t have a negligent discharge.[/i]\n\n[i]Second, with the negligible exception of protecting against a push or pull against the side front of the trigger, all proper Glock safeties guard against drops, but not always as you might think.[/i]\n\n[i]A drop of a solid object onto a solid surface can produce remarkably high G forces. A drop where the pistol lands on the top of its slide could easily unsafe the firing pin safety as its inertia would easily overcome the spring loading. Fortunately the same G forces would push the trigger bar upwards, relative to the normal orientation of the pistol, and push it more firmly into engagement with the firing pin. So that is a safe drop orientation.[/i]\n\n[i]The most serious risk is from a drop onto the tail of the slide. Here the full mass of the trigger and trigger bar will be pushed back. If the impact is large enough then, without the trigger safety, this force could, in principle, push the trigger bar back far enough to act as though the trigger had been pulled. That is, it would disengage the firing pin safety, further cock the firing pin against its spring, cam the trigger bar down against the connector/disconnector and fire the pistol. The trigger safety stops this from happening because it is in neutral balance against this force and its spring holds it in place unless the pistol is spinning very rapidly, as in the infamous Frisbee test. [/i]\n\n[i]Lastly we have the simply named drop safety. This provides a guide for the cruciform of the trigger bar which prevents it moving downwards until the trigger is pulled most of the way back. Ostensibly this guards against an upward impact on the but of the pistol forcing the trigger bar down and releasing the partly cocked firing pin. What would happen if it did? The gun would not fire because the firing pin would be blocked by the firing pin safety which would be held more strongly in its safe position by this direction of impact. [/i]\n\n[i]So what is the drop safety for? It protects you from the circumstance where you drop your Glock, perhaps in the course of a fight, then pick it up and try to shoot. Without the drop safety the result might not even be a click because the firing pin would have been disengaged from the trigger bar cruciform by the drop. That is, the firing pin would be fully forward against the firing pin safety. If it is not partially cocked it will not fire! So the drop safety protects you from the gun not firing when you need it to fire rather than from firing when it shouldn''t fire. [/i]\n\n[i]It should be clear from this that the PRIMARY mechanical safety of the Glock against accidental discharge when the gun is dropped is the trigger safety. [/i]\n\n[i]There is no safety against it being fired once it is in your hand with your finger on the trigger and nor should there be. [/i]\n\n[i]There is no safety worthy of the name against discharge when something other than your trigger finger snags the trigger and pulls it back. This is actually a major failing of what is an ingenious piece of engineering. [/i]\n\n[i]All mechanical systems can fail and in this case we are trusting a lot to a small engagement of two pieces of cheap molded plastic. Apart from that the firing pin safety can get stuck in the up position if it gets too dirty, the firing pin/cruciform engagement can be insecure if it has been modified and/or damaged so that there is a very small engagement but this combination would also probably need a soft primer to fire. [/i]\n\n[i]For what it is worth, I do not believe that any pistol design solves the re:holstering/snagging problem in a reasonably fail safe manor. A manual or thumb safety will do so provided you remember to put it on safe every time you holster. The psychological fact is that the time you are least likely to do this is in the immediate aftermath of combat. This is also the time when you are most likely to be clumsy as you re-holster. [/i]\n[quote=HasanJamshad]\nSo, there are many options available to prevent any accident.

This weapon was very deadly and consisted of a wood or metal shaft with a mounted head of bronze, copper, wood, or steel. The mace was carried and used by both foot soldiers and Calvary men. Maces were very effective in battle and could puncture even the heaviest of armor. This was a barbaric weapon and left battlefields filled with torture and blood. \n\n\n[b]2)Hawaiian Throwing Axe[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/1833/phplta9mg.png[/img][/url]\n\nThis Hawaiian Throwing Axe was a deadly hand held weapon that could be used at both short and long range. This weapon was made out of wood and shark teeth had the power to take men’s limbs off. This weapon was mainly used when opposing Hawaiian armies closed upon each other. They were then thrown at the opposing troops to help soften enemy ranks before close combat. They could also be used in hand to hand combat and had the muscle to rip open skin as if it was butter. This was a very dangerous weapon and is not something you would want to go up against.\n\n[b]3)Hunga Munga[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/439/phpy01jtg.png[/img][/url]\nThe Hunga Munga is an African tribal weapon that is way ahead of its time. It is a handheld weapon and contains a metal pointed blade with a curved back section and separate spike near the handle. This weapon was used in fighting between African tribes and was often times throw in a rotating motion causing deep wounds and even death. Its variation of blades allowed it to be used as more then a weapon. It was used as a tool in farming and even in building structures. It was a great all around tool and has been found all throughout Africa. Today you may have seen the Hunga Munga in the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Buffy uses it once in a while to fight off evil demons that she faces. \n\n\n\n\n[b]4)Throwing Star[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/5493/phpikqmfa.png[/img][/url]\n\nThe throwing star known as the shuriken which means “a dagger hidden in a palm” were used and invented by the Japanese. The stars had much variation in the shape; some were shaped like a star and thrown with spin, yet others were needlelike and thrown like a throwing dagger. These daggers couldn’t penetrate armor, but the ninjas, who used them, usually didn’t fight armored opponents. Venom was normally used with the shuriken. \n\n\n\n\n[b]5)Caltrop[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/2369/phpclmdao.png[/img][/url]\n\nThe Caltrop is a weapon made up of two or more sharp spikes or spines arranged so that one of them points upward from a stable base. Caltrops serve to slow down the proceeding of horses, war elephants, and human troops. It was said to be particularly effective against the soft feet of camels. These were very painful if stepped on and were spread all throughout battle fields. They also were deadly because if stepped on it would cause a bad infection that would cause a slow agonizing death. They also have been used in modern times. In the Vietnam War the Vietcong put them into booby traps. If an American soldier was punctured by one he died from infection almost 90% of the time. \n\n\n\n\n[b]6)Crossbow Pistol[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/2227/phpr1mo52.png[/img][/url]\n\nThis 17th Century Crossbow was way ahead of its time and is very cool. This crossbows look like an early form of a pistol and was very powerful. This hand held crossbow was both accurate and effective but it just was too hard to reload. Because of this it was not used very often in battle and was used more for target practice. Another problem with this weapon was making the arrows which was to time consuming especially if they were just going to get lost in battle. Overall this weapon was still badass and really shows what type of technology and ideas the 17th Century had. \n\n\n\n[b]7)Trebuchet[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx1zGeRr][img]http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/1779/phpb7vttp.th.png[/img][/url]\n\nA trebuchet is basically a high powered catapult and had many uses in ancient times. Mainly used as a weapon it had enough power to break through castles and destroy towns. It was first used in the 16th Century. Rocks, dead horses, dead people, and dead animals were all used as ammo. In the 16th and 17th Century when plagues and diseases were looming over civilizations plagued bodies were thrown by the trebuchet into enemy territory. The bodies decomposed passing the plague to the enemies slowly killing them. This is one of the first forms of biological warfare.\n\n\n\n\n\n[b]8)Ancient Rocket Launcher[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1ttWNi][img]http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/8334/phpsr1iaf.th.png[/img][/url]\n\nIn the 14th century, the Chinese invented rocket-launchers. These were weapons which shot arrows with rockets attached near the tip into the air toward the enemy. Also in the 14th century, multi-stage rockets were made. When the rockets near the front of the device burnt out, they lit fuses for the second-stage rockets at the back. The bombs the Chinese used in the 17th century were made of gunpowder wrapped in paper and had a fuse covered in gunpowder. \n\n\n\n\n[b]9)Ancient Flame-Thrower[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/3488/phplzijxp.png[/img][/url]\n\nThe Chinese invented the continuous flame-thrower in the tenth century. In the picture above we see the tank standing on four legs, with the pump and device above it. Because the Chinese invention of a double-acting Piston-bellows was used with this device, a continuous stream of flame could be emitted. The metal used was brass.

If you pull back the slide, the outer surface of barrel has lost its luster and slightly rusted all over. Inside of barrel is also uniformly rusted. According to a website, to strip it, its slide should lock somewhere in the middle of the pull, on an empty mag. Then the little pin near the top of the trigger guard is pushed through to the other side to start dis-assembly. The pin on our piece doesn''t budge as if its welded...\n\nPlease guide about how it should be cleaned? Is stripping necessary for a thorough cleaning after so long a period? Can the cleaning mixes suggested by 12gauge be used in this case? If so, should i keep it dipped in cleaner/solvent etc?

However, cynics were proved wrong with the arrival in Pakistan of two small batch production (SBP) aircraft in March, and also assurances from the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) that the issue has been resolved. The two SBP aircraft will be joined by six more by the end of the year for weapons and systems integration, and indigenous construction of the first batch (complete with in-flight refuelling capability) is slated to begin next year. With further improvements being made to the design, the JF-17 will be entering frontline service in 2009, and is on course to replace all the PAF A-5C, Mirage-III/IV, and F-7P/PG aircraft on a one-for-one basis by 2015, five years earlier than initially envisioned. Furthermore, efforts are already underway to find the first export customer with considerable interest already been shown by some countries. Whilst even at the beginning of the year the project appeared in trouble, it certainly appears on track now that aircraft are beginning to land in Pakistan.\n[b]Avionics and airframe developments[/b]\n\nImprovements in other areas have already been made. Aerodynamic changes have increased the manoeuvrability and versatility of the aircraft, and the SBP aircraft probably represent the final airframe configuration. The most notable of these has been the convex [b]DSI (Divertless Supersonic Inlets)[/b] intakes. These have helped reduce the overall weight of the airframe, and after an internal redesign, freed up space for more stores, most notably fuel for slightly increased range. These weight saving changes have also allowed the [b]maximum speed to be increased to Mach 1.8[/b]. Though this is still limited compared to current fighter aircraft, further changes, (most notably the powerplant), are likely to improve matters somewhat. Other internal changes include a full fly-by-wire set of controls, and more high tech avionics. The issue of the radar (which will probably be joined by an Infra Red Search Tracking - IRST - sensor), has also seen a number of potential developments. Since the design of the airframe was decoupled from the avionics set up in 1998, things have changed considerably. [b]The PAF had initially hoped to have a full set of Western avionics in the JF-17, but the imposition of Western sanctions in 1998 scuttled this[/b]. However, increases made in Chinese avionics design, have resulted in a f[b]ull glass cockpit, and for the first 51 production aircraft, installation of the Chinese Nanjing KLJ-7 radar[/b]. The PAF is said to be very impressed with this radar and sources say it has a comfortable advantage over the APG-66 radar fitted to the current PAF F-16 fleet. This in itself is no major breakthrough, as though still quite capable, the APG-66 is a fairly old design now in terms of modern radars. However, it does represent the advances the Chinese avionics industry has made in trying to bridge the gap between western radars and its own products. [b]The KLJ-7 radar is actually a very important development for another reason, as it will mean the initial batch of aircraft will be fully able to fire the Chinese SD-10 BVRAAM.[/b] Such a capability has been a core requirement for the PAF for some time, so the first batch of JF-17s will be taking a huge load off the current interceptor fleet. However, there had been speculation that the I[b]talian Grifo S-7 or the British Vixen 500E may be installed[/b], but the PAF may yet be looking for an even more [b]advanced AESA radar[/b]. No decision has yet been taken in this regard, but it is likely to be resolved with the induction of the second batch. Finally a data-link is to be incorporated allowing for secure data transmission between various platforms. This is an important capability with the impending arrival of the Saab-2000 EIRIYE AEW&C aircraft, and also the possibility that not every aircraft in the strike role will carry a targeting pod, for financial reasons. T[b]he JF-17 will also have an advanced electronic warfare system housed in the fin top fairing. This will be linked to the Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) sensors fitted fore and aft to give 360 degree coverage[/b]. In terms of electronic warfare capabilities, [b]the JF-17 will be second only to the F-16C Block-52 in PAF service.\n[/b]\n[b]Indigenous production[/b]\n\nPakistani engineers are currently being trained in China in readiness for indigenous construction, and the assembly line itself is being ‘tooled up’. Indigenous construction will begin in 2009, [b]and will start at 15 aircraft per year before being increased to 25 – 30[/b]. The number may well be boosted by Chinese built airframes in order to replace the existing legacy types sooner if the need arises. This probably entails the initial number of [b]150 JF-17s ordered being increased to 200 – 250 in order to equip up to 12 squadrons[/b]. It is hoped that within three years up to 50 percent of the airframe and avionics will be indigenously manufactured, and this percentage may well rise in the future. Some of the parts manufactured in Pakistan are likely to also feature in any potential export aircraft.\n[b]Armament[/b]\nThe JF-17 can carry a payload in the region of [b]3,800kg[/b] on [b]seven hardpoints[/b], three of which (centreline and inner pylons) are plumbed for fuel. However, in-flight refuelling capability will allow weapons to be carried in lieu of tanks if required. Furthermore, though prototype aircraft have been seen with multiple ejector racks fitted, it is not currently known if the [b]JF-17/FC-1 can carry two BVRAAM missiles per under-wing station in a manner such as the F-18 can[/b]. The combat proven, Gsh-23-2 twin-barrelled cannon, is mounted on the underside in a pack between the port intake and fuselage.As stated the BVR engagement capability of the JF-17 is a key requirement. [b]With the order of 500 Aim-120-C5 [/b]missiles for the expanding F-16 fleet, the AMRAAM may well be integrated onto the JF-17. This is by no means a certainty, and the PAF is rumoured to also be examining a further option from a western source, most likely the French MBDA Mica. Though the AMRAAM currently sets the standard for BVRAAMs, the Mica is highly capable with its ability to engage targets at BVR ranges, as well as during close-in dogfights. The PAF’s interest in the Mica is despite it being due for replacement by the MBDA Meteor BVRAAM. However, if all else fails then there is still the Sino SD-10/PL-12, China’s first successful BVRAAM, which as stated, can no doubt be easily integrated with the KLJ-7 radar. For the principal WVR missile the PAF is hoping to equip the JF-17 with an agile fifth generation dogfight missile (though the current Aim-9 Sidewinder will still be fitted), which will be integrated with a likely Chinese origin helmet mounted sight (HMS) similar to the Boeing Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) ordered for the new PAF F-16s. During IDEAS2006 in November last year, the Diehl BGT IRIS-T was being touted as the likely candidate. With its High Off Bore Sight (HOBS) engagement capability (including the ability to engage threats in the rear hemisphere), and incredible manoeuvrability, the IRIS-T may well be an effective counter to Thrust Vector Control (TVC) capable Indian fighters such as the Su-30MKI, a plane the JF-17s development was stretched out in order to counter. The integration on an affordable airframe of such potent missiles clearly makes the JF-17 a dangerous opponent for potential adversaries. Prototypes had a stated maximum [b]G limit of +8.5[/b], which is limited in modern terms. However, the ability of a fighter to quickly establish itself into a turn may be more important than its continued turning capability in some respects, and the use of HMS/HOBS missile capability may negate the need for such close in manoeuvrability even if proposed improvements do not increase the ‘G’ limits. Integration of air-to-ground weaponry will follow that of air-to-air weapons. This will include PGMs already in the PAF arsenal and used by the Mirage-III/IV fleet, such as the H-4 (thought to be a local production of the Denel Raptor-II MUPSOW – MUlti-Purpose Stand-Off Weapon). Pakistani, and especially Chinese, PGM design and manufacture are continuing a pace. Chinese air-to-ground weaponry is improving especially rapidly, with satellite guided weaponry becoming available; it is likely that such weapons will be integrated on the JF-17 in due course.\n[b]Characteristics[/b]\nLength: 14.97 m (49 ft 1 in)\n\nWingspan: 9.46 m (31 ft 0 in)\n\nHeight: 4.77 m (15 ft 8 in)\n\nEmpty weight: 6,450 kg (14,220 lb)\n\nLoaded weight: 9,100 kg (20,062 lb)\n\nMax takeoff weight: 12,700 kg (27,999 lb)\n\nWeapons payload: 3,800kg (8,378 lb)\n\nPowerplant: 1 x RD-93 turbofan (81.3 kN), 8,290 kgf (18,277 lbf)\n\nMaximum speed: Mach 1.8.

Are the safeties easy to engage/ disengage in a stressful situation? There are others, but you get the gist.\n\nWhile on the topic of Stoeger Cougar vs Taurus PT909, why don''t we add the PT911/915 to the discussion too (no rail, same mag cap., slightly shorter in height that PT909).\n\nMy own personal opinion goes towards the Taurus (if reliability issues are justified) due to the fact that I like frame mounted safeties better than slide mounted safeties.

You have started a nice thread.......\r\n\r\n"Raiin" or " The Goral/ The Grey Goral" is a Goat definitely...... a very beautiful animal once roamed  commonly in most parts of the Hazara Division.... usually it is found from 1000 to 4000m altitudes.. both in lower mountainous terrain of Haripur to the alpine forests of the Kaghan Valley.It is relatively a small sized animal that''s why commonly locals call it a '' BAKRI" OR "TEDY BAKRI" along with its common name of "RAAIIN" through out the region, and  undoubtedly like any other goat it has some remarkable climbing and running skills on the slopes.\r\n\r\nOnce it was in good numbers on the bordering mountainous range of Tarbela Dam along with many other bird species like seesee and chakors, but all these three are nearly vanished due to relatively easy approach and lot of hunting/poaching. In my limited knowledge still few groups are surviving in Khanpur range which is bordering the Margalla Hills.\r\n\r\nIn Kaghan valley a moderate population is surviving in Shogran range and specifically the "Malakandi Forest". In summer mostly it is not hunted, because of  many reasons but most obvious is that it remains in very difficult slopes or areas of the jungle. In winter locals usually hunt it in a party formation after heavy snow fall. The "ustaads" locate good passing spots on specific tracks in snow on which these animal move after heavy snow.Few hunters are placed on these spots and a good climber drives the animals from difficult area to that track and when the animals pass across any sitting hunter he takes his chance with mostly single barrel 12g shot gun having No.4 "wallaity cartoos" or SG.\r\n\r\nThe meat of the  harvested animal/animals is equally distributed among the party and the skin is dried and used mostly used as "Massalla/Jai-Namaz".\r\nIn Azad Kashmir the numbers of this animal is on higher side, two major factors one is due to presence of army in most of its habitat, where locals have some restrictions. secondly due to some good conservation work for the "MUSK DEER" which is also benefiting this specie.\r\n\r\nLast month we visited "Moji Game reserve" in leepa valley near "Dao khun" on an excursion trip. our host mentioned few road side spots for "Raaiin hunts" during winter.\r\nin Azad Kashmir locals use same hunting method and guns for this animal.

Had there been a full bang there could have been a greater damage to the slide and a nasty recoil of the pistol as full energy must have released backward. I have seen a that kind of accident at LRC and the guy involved was a medalist shooter Mr Raza Tarin(whom ABBAS bought Rugger) and the gun was Glock. Whenever there is a weak bang we find a lot of unburnt gunpowder in chamber and slide, mostly shell dosen''t get ejected(due to the lack of power) and pallet stuck in the barrel(due to lack of power).\nIf the ammo go off with full force then there can be wrong diameter projectile or way too accessive jammed barrel to create a such result of stuck projectile.

Back when the hammer held the firing pin. Todays revolvers don''t have that problem. In the older rifles that had a hammer set firing pin the soft pin that held the firing pin in the hammer would sheer off and you would lose or damage the firing pin. Floating pin assemblies on hammered rifles( like winchesters and sharps) would sometimes sheer the tip of the firing pin or the pin would jam in the forward position literally wedging itself into it''s own frame. We don''t have these problems today with the end of the use of brass springs. On rim fire guns especially revolvers and some bolt action rifles you can get a pinging effect inside the breech or on the revolver cylinder damaging them. The firing pin is also blunted and ultimately shortened causing misfire. The only real dry fire damage today is on rim fire revolvers most other guns have that extra space to keep the firing pin from striking steel.

To obtaim that permit an individual must take a course. The course is approx. 10 hours for long guns and an additional 6 hours for handguns. It includes instruction re: safety, function, storage and laws pertaining to different types of firearms. There is a written test as well as a practical test.\n\nI am a federal firearms instructor, and have put approx 400 students through the course.\n\nThere are background checks for criminal records etc.\n\nOnce the permit is issued. The individual can buy as many firearms as they wish with some restrictions.  Assault type rifles and handguns require a different level of instruction and a different permit.\n\nAll firearms must be registered by the owner in a national registry.\n\nThe provincial and city governments will also have some restrictions as to how where and when firearms may be used within their boundaries.\n\nIf a person wants to hunt, they must take a provincial hunter education course. This course requires about 25 hours of instruction and a written and practical test. The hunt course covers ethics, safety, firearms functions, wildlife identification, archery hunting, survival etc.\n\nI''ve been a provincial hunting instructor since 1975 and have lost track of how many students I have put through the course.\n\nWe are fortunate in Alberta in that we have  terrain and an abundance of wildlife and birds to hunt. We do not have a large population of hunters, but we do have access to a large and base to hunt on. This made up of both public and private land.\nthe terrain ranges from large rugged and isolated mountain ranges to open gras plains and everything between. \n\nAlberta is about 661,848 km2  in area and has a population of 3.6 million.

So what do you people think about these two?\nI would lik to post my opion on both of these rounds as follows:\n\n- There are 2 types of .30 bores which can be used in TT pistols, a Tokarev(Russian) bullet and a Mauser(German) bullet\n.30 bore = 7.62x25mm cartridge = Also called Tokarev Round = Thinner bullet\nalso there is a .30 Mauser bullet which can also be used in a TT pistol = 7.63x25mm Mauser \n\n- on the other hand:\n9mm = 35.56 bore = 9x19mm cartridge = Also called 9mm parabellum or 9mm Luger = Fatter bullet\n........................\n"Tokarev round" is a very powerful round a generating power levels upto 300 to 600 foout pounds,HPs are also available for this round by Sellior & Bellot company though someone should import themt to Pak. these tokarevs have velocities normally from 1400 upto 1700 fps depending upon the charge and even higher upto 2200 fps in specialized AP ammo used by some militaries. Bullet weights range from 80 to 100 grains. The mauser bullet(7.63x25mm) was from Germany which was the base bullet for Tokarevs technically. They are very similar bullets and that is why Soviets used Mauser bullets used by Germans in their C96 Mauser captured and then later used in their TTs.. however tokarev is loaded to higher pressures and little greater powder charge as compated to Mauser ammo, that is why it generates nearly identical or sometimes higher energy levels/velocities than mauser ammo. Armour Piercing rounds are also available for this. They are better suited for Submachine gun ammo.. however tokarev''s stopping power is less as compared to 9mm. they are more flat shooting than 9mm. in SD role only JHP tokarev bullet would do a difference otherwise its a zipper round. wont stay inside body and drill a very narrow hole, if bleeding is stopped, man shot by tokarev can reach hospital on his own feet :) steel core russian/eastern europian ammo is easy to find for this round, also JHPs are now available. Normal FMJs are real good penetrators in car chassis and windshields.. but their ability to kill after penetration is 50% cuz of light weight and fast moving hence unstable projectile afterwards an initial hit.\n....................................................\n"9mm" is a very high pressure cartridge like SIG .357. using a smaller case and gaining higher case pressures make it versatile .. still used at war fronts. 9mm still have adequate usage all around the world due to its over all volume of the round. easy on transporting/carrying and manufacturing. 9mm also is quite a zipp through round on human targets so in SD role a JHP 9mm is taken as something serious all around the world. Ball round is basically used in subguns in LE and military. Powerlevels of 9mm ranges from 350 to 500 Foot pounds max/ Velocitis vary from subsonic 900+ fps to 1400 fps depending on powder and even as high as 1700fps in some specialized AP ammo. Weights of projectile varies from usually 100 to 147 grains. Its a round that is commercially available in so many configurations of bullets and power levels. FMJ/JHP, bonded cores, EFMJ, Wadcutters, steel cores etc. 9mm loaded to higher power levels with steel cores do penetrate level 2 bullet proof vests and in normal FMJ configuration it does penetrate and still kill a target behind a wind shield and common automibile   chassis. also 9mm is most widely used semi auto pistol cartridge all over the world. It is a very well balanced round that sits of the edge of performance/ballistics with respect to cost of manufacturing. not too much power and not too less, just a middle rounder cartridge makes it versatile all the way.\n\n- In my opinion Tokarev or their modern counter parts such as FN 5.7x28mm are better suited for specialized use such as AP, flat shooting, and war fronts. It is war front where hitting and injuring is preferable than killing. injured army men are demoralizers to rest of army.\n- 9mm is more versatile and can perform within civilian regime as well as battle grounds.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7221/88907234.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '119.152.69.91', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1731, 42456),

A double barrel SxS''s trigger mechanism (hammer and flint lock types) was easier to design in a horizontal configuration. as the technology progressed, browning gave re-birth to O/U design with the legendary trigger mechanism still considered the most reliable of any shotgun ever produced. now with dawn of international sporting events and splendid media converage of those events and styles/trends associated with it, O/U are making a huge come back, pushing SxS in to the haze which for long has been the domain of O/U.\n\nThat was the histroy lesson, now lets get digging into the advantages/disadvantages of each type.\n\n\n[b]SxS:[/b]\n\nBarrels are stacked horizontaly, this gives low profile to the receiver (a plus), breaking open the sidelock/boxlock is easier as user doesnt have to open it to a larger angle to insert/eject the cartridges. it gives a large sighthing plane, somewhat usefull in bird hunting (flushing). then there is that traditionalism associated with a fine SxS shotgun. since barrels are horizontally stacked, their over all profile is lowered, giving an impression (only an impression) they''ll swing more smoothly to a fast moving target.\n\nDown side to this type of barrel configuation is that recoil is a mess, one barrel pushes the shoulder one way and other barrel pushes it the other way (to a degree i''m not comfortable with). the muzzle jump is screwy too, one barrel flips right and other barrel flips left.\n\n[b]O/U:[/b]\n\nHere, barrels are stacked vertically, one barrel on top of the other hence single sighting plane for both barrels. your both barrels (ideally) should behave as if its a single barrel gun. narrow and single sighting plane is a big plus in skeet/trap (as the target is small and fast moving). the same can be said about hunting scenarios as single sighting plane is quiet helpful. recoil is superb, single recoil angle, same barrel jump/flip for both barrels is also very helpful (when u consider second shot at the same fast moving target).\n\nDownside to vertically configured barrels would be that receiver is odd looking, its not sleek enough (with newer machining however receivers are comming in ever slimmer and low profile shapes). you have to break open the shotgun to a larger degree to insert/eject cartridges since reaching down to the chamber of bottom barrel can be considered difficult (can be a pain if you have to do it over and over and over and over and over again). larger angle break opening also poses problems in duck blinds (limited space).\n\n[b]Summary:[/b]\n\nWell, in the end it all boils down to personal preferance, however if u look at the general trend worldwide, sport shooters almost always prefer O/U (its the "in-thing" these days), a fine over and under shotgun is perfect for serious sports shooting along with hunting every now and then. infact internationally anybody who prefers sports shooting (given a O/U user) would almost always prefer a O/U for hunting as well.\n\nOn a sports field, a Side by Side is like an extinct species, u cant do skeet or trap with it (ok u can, sorta like Suzuki Mehran can do a little bit of off-roading if the need ever arises). the wider sighting plane might be useful in bird hunting but poses serious problems in skeet/trap as the target totally disappears between the two barrels. thats why u dont see any SxS in any international sporting event. for hunting this wider sighting is a plus (for some).\n\nin the end it all boils down to personal taste and preference. if u see ur self in the mirror as a person wearing a traditional khaky safari suit with brown leather long boots smoking a cigar, i''m sure if u''ll also see a SxS shotgun in the picture as well.\n\nand if u see ur self wearing a half sleeve polo shirt, NIKE/ADDIDAS sports shoes/joggers, sports/digital watch, a very cool shade, ducks unlimited eyewear, and an energy drink in the nearby then ur probably the O/U type of a guy.\n\n[b]Regards.[/b]', 0, 1, '58.65.188.118', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1728, 42462),

The person who demonstrated this process used a 25 yard pistol target located 100 yards away.   This provides the perfect view for best results.   \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/aV1ulxCJ.jpg[/img][/url]\nStart by removing the bolt, then using a good rest, position your rifle so that you can look through the barrel and see the target.

It''s an easy procedure, and all you need is a rest that can hold your rifle steady, while you make the scope adjustments.   I''ve seen many new shooters that would have saved lots of time and ammunition, if they just knew how to bore sight their rifle.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3015/74587351.jpg[/img][/url]\nThe crosshairs might look like this . . . . so the steps to adjust this difference is as follows:\n\nNow that your barrel is perfectly lined up with the target, you know that your crosshairs also need to be centered.   However, this is where shooters often get confused.   You don''t want to move the crosshairs LOW and LEFT according to the turret markings, because that would move your bullet impact right off the target.\n\nThe markings on scope turrets indicate the direction of bullet impact, not the direction of crosshair movement.   In this case, you need to adjust your scope UP and RIGHT according to the turret markings, until the crosshairs are centered on the pistol target.   Remember to not move your rifle at all when making these adjustments.\n\nHave fun.\n\nThanx to Larry W.', 0, 1, '110.37.65.113', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1747, 42963),

Having said this, I myself do use the word Mosque and have also heard many ulema also use the word. In fact there is a popular Islamic QnA website where people write in to get fatawa and the shaikh on that site who is a very big alim in the Arab world has not objected to the usage of the term Mosque. Anyway I found this short article on the subject quite interesting and informative\n\n\n[quote]\n [b]Question:[/b] I was flipping through this book the other day called ‘The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Understanding Islam’ and it is filled with fun facts. One of them concerns the term ‘Mosque’. This book pointed out that the term ‘mosque’ is derived from the Spanish word for ‘mosquito’. It was termed as such because during the Crusades, King Ferdinand said they were going to go and swat the Muslims ‘like mosquitoes’. Please let me know.\n\n\n   [b] Answer:[/b] From my research, I have found that there are four possible origins for the word ‘mosque’ in the English language. The first possibility is that it derives from the French word ‘mosquee’ that existed during the period in French linguistic history known as ‘Middle French’. The second possibility is that it is a derivative of the Arabic word ‘masjid’. The third possibility is that it derives from the Old Italian word ‘moschea’ and the final possibility is that it comes from the Old Spanish word ‘mezquita’. These various words were used to describe the Muslim place of worship in the various languages mentioned. \n    My research found no indication that mosque was derived from the word ‘mosquito’. Regarding the appearance of the term mosque in the English language, scholars suggest it was around 1711 AD. This is far after King Ferdinand and the Crusades. It might be that the term ‘mezquita,’ used to describe a masjid in old Spanish, came from the word ‘mosquito’ and then subsequently the term ‘mezquita’ was used to form the term mosque. However, this would not mean that the term mosque was developed as a result of the story you related.\n    With the above in mind, I believe it is important to keep a sensible perspective when approaching the origin of words. Words are dynamic and over time often change their meanings from what they originally may have been intended for. It is likely that there are many words in all languages that result from the ignorance or hatred that may have once existed between peoples, races, tribes or religions. We should consider contemporary usage of words and the intention of their current meanings as most important. \n    Two examples of this might help give a better perspective. The term ‘picnic’ in the English language came under fire some years back when certain scholars suggested that it was actually a shortened version of ‘pick a nigger’. Some decades ago, in the US, there was a racist and vulgar practice known as lynching, where a mob of white people would torture and mutilate a black person (then derogatively called a ‘nigger’), often under the false pretext that this person was guilty of a crime. This lynching often involved an entire event where people brought food and family to a park and watched the lynching. Subsequent to the lynching they would take pictures next to the mutilated body! Some scholars contend that the concept of a picnic, and the actual term, resulted from this practice of ‘picking a nigger’ to lynch and having a small feast at the event. Now despite the possibility of a treacherous background to this word, its usage in common times connotes nothing of the sort. \n    Similarly, the Arabic term ‘ajami has commonly been used, throughout Islamic history, to refer to non-Arabs or those who did not speak Arabic. The meaning of this word is actually in reference to those animals, like goats and cows, that make one syllable sounds. Hence, the term contains cultural superiority and a arrogant insult towards non-Arabic speakers. However, now this term has become synonymous with non-Arabic speaking peoples, forsaking its original background.\n\n(Adnan Zulfiqar)\n\n[/quote]', 0, 1, '94.172.135.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1724, 43082),

This should serve as a reminder to at least attempt to properly verify such things, and a lesson to not believe everything we read (especially from books which self-describe themselves as being for idiots). Feel free to use the words mosque, mosqueé, mezquita, and ponder over the history of this word and how it carries with it part of our Islamic legacy and is a testament to the great Muslim nation of al-Andalus which for 800 years existed in Western Europe." \n[/b][/quote]\n\n\n[url]http://muslimspeak.wordpress.com/2009/01/15/the-meaning-and-evolution-of-the-word-mosque/[/url]', 0, 1, '94.172.135.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1724, 43099),

I also have three extended chokes and have always found their patterns to be less than ideal with lead, with steel shot however they are fine. but since in Pakistan most shooting is done with lead shots, its pointless to have "steel rated only" choke tubes.\n\ni''ve heard about carlsons but cant say much about them, If u''r thinking of buying aftermarket chokes to improve patterns then go for Trulock (i''ve ordered four for my cousin and used them) or colonial arms. as far as these two manufacturers are concerned, their chokes definately improve patterns and are true to their advertisement/claim.\n\nRegards', 0, 1, '58.65.189.46', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1162, 43206),

The places where Muslims used to gather in large numbers were the masjids and that is where it was most convenient to attack and murder them.\n\nTo the Spaniards, taking their lead from their king, attacking congregations  of  Muslims  in  Masjids  was  indeed  like swatting mosquitoes, so the term MOSQUE (abbreviation for the place where Muslim Mosquitoes were best ''swatted''  in large numbers) was introduced.  With mosquito, as the time passed, mosque was gradually absorbed into English. \n\nMosque thus became widely used & accepted as influence of the Muslims waned and English Language spread across the world. \n\nThe Arabic word “MASJID” comes from “SAJDA” which is the right word for our prayer place.

Remove the MAGAZINE by pressing the MAGAZINE RELEASE BUTTON. BE SURE that the chamber is EMPTY by pulling back on the slide. Lock the slide open by pushing the slide catch lever up with the slide back. Look in the chamber (from the side not down the barrel) and make sure there is no bullet there. \nWith the slide locked open twist the slide disassembly latch down (clockwise) until it stops.\nCompletely remove the slide disassembly latch from the frame.\n\nCarefully release the slide catch, and with the slide under FULL control, pull the slide forward off of the frame. - If the slide sticks on the frame, be sure the chamber is empty (YOU DID DO THAT, RIGHT???) and firmly pull the trigger fully to the rear while pulling the slide forward off the frame. - If the slide does not move because the barrel remains to the rear and tilted upward, be sure the chamber is empty and push the muzzle against the palm of your hand while pushing the slide forward with the other. \nTake out the spring. Note: this is a spring. Be careful. \nTake out the barrel and that''s as apart as this gun ever needs to get without a gunsmith. \nUse a wire brush to get all the really tough stuff out of the barrel. You should only push the brush in the direction that the bullet would travel. Do this a few times. \nYou don''t need to remove the bore brush to pull it back through the barrel as the cleaning rod rotates provided that you grip it from the handle. Still always push the brush and the patch through the bore from the breech end of the barrel only, never from the muzzle end. \nWet a patch with solvent and run it through the bore a few times, then set the barrel aside and leave it wet with solvent. Go clean the frame/slide. By leaving the barrel to soak you allow the solvent to soften and losen any hard caked on fouling. \nNow you come back to the barrel. Get several patches ready. Wet the bore brush with solvent and grip the cleaning rod at the base just above the handle and rotate the brush in the chamber first, this scrubs the chamber and headspace area. Next grip the t-handle of the rod and push all the way through the bore back and forth several times, allowing the rod to rotate in the bore as the brush contacts with the lands and grooves. Make sure the brush is screwed on tight and does not come loose from the rod when pulling it back through the bore, sometimes they tend to come loose making them ineffective on the pull through. Next attach your slotted jag and take a wetted patch and run it back and forth a few times through the bore. Make sure these patches fit reasonably snug in the bore. I like to to rotate them in the chamber first to allow the patch to swirl around the jag for better surface contact once in the bore. Repeat with a new wet patch a few more times and keep changing them until one comes out clean. When you are satisfied take a snug fitting dry clean patch and dry the bore. Hold your barrel up to a light and inspect it, or use a light. Is it clean? Any area where the is still fouling? If so, then repeat the barrel cleaning prosess until you are satisfied. About every 5000 rounds or so use a copper solvent to remove copper fouling from your bore. Just to keep it in check, copper fouling really isn''t that detrimental to pistols as it is to accuracy in precision rifles. When using a copper solvent for copper removal make sure to use only a steel or aluminum rod and plastic bore brush and plastic slotted jag, no brass or bronze. \nPut the cleaning rod through the barrel. Put a large patch (square piece of cloth from ur old T Shirt.. lolz) on the end of the cleaning rod, dip the patch in solvent and pull it through the barrel. Pull the patch through in the same direction as the bullet would travel. Repeat with a new patch until the patches comes out clean. You can then wipe the outside of the barrel with a patch and solvent. \nSlide/Frame: Get some clean cotton cloths (again old laundered T-shirts) cut to about 7X7 inches or so. You will need at least 4 of these per cleaning. Get several Q-tips. Get a wooden chopstick and whittle the end to a chisel tip. Pipe cleaners also come in handy. Wet one of the cloths with solvent and wipe the inside of the frame and slide. Pay special attention to the breech face and extractor area. Use solvent wet Q-tips and a wet patch with the chopstick to get crud out of the rail and rail grooves, fouling out if the breech face and extractor claw. Pay attention to the locking lugs too. Use as many q-tips, cloths, and patches as you need for this. When satisfied, take your last clean dry cotton cloth and wipe dry all the solvent and crud from your slide/frame. \nLook at all the metal flakes inside the slide. Clean out the slide with a patch and some solvent.\nDo the same with the handle full of metal flakes.\nPut the barrel and spring back together the same way they came apart just in reverse order.\nBefore re-assemebly make sure all the solvent is wiped dry. A blow works well for blowing out any residual solvent still hiding in hard to reach places. Inspect all the parts for wear, cracks, or breakage. Make sure to never over oil your gun. The better method for oiling any firearm is to use only a very very slightly dampened patch and wipe oil residue on the rails, lugs, and outside of the barrel before assembeling. All you need is a very slight and very thin film of oil on guns, you should barely be able to see it with your eyes. Remember that if you see any oil running or oosing out any time, you''ve got way too much oil.\n\nOnce in a while disassemble your magazines and clean them with solvent then wipe dry. \nPut the slide back on the same way it came off. Pull it all the way back and lock it open with the slide catch lever.\n\n\nPut the slide disassembly latch back in. UPDATE: Be sure that the barrel is all the way forward before attempting to replace the slide disassembly latch.\n\n\nThae spring makes insertion of the slide disassembly latch VERY difficult. Orient the slide disassembly latch with the tab facing the rear of the pistol and push it in. It will be hard but it does go in other side\n Source: [url]http://www.kaptain.us/guns/clean.html[/url]', 0, 1, '58.65.203.205', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1769, 43727),

Is this not to be done during initial period?[/quote]\n\n\nwhen the manual says "lubricate each time...." it means lubricate each time before any firing session, it doesn''t mean to lubricate before each shot. the purspose of the above statement is to ensure that the operator purposedly over lubricates the gun as during the break-in period all moving parts are sorta grinding with each other before setting down to their desired position.\n\nfrom over lubrication I recon: lubricate to the point where u can see a very thin film of oil on all critical/moving parts (they should look shiny), it doesnt mean that the film be thick enough for u to see ur own reflection or the oil should drip all the way down to ur boots.\n\nabout the break-in period, it is recommended to fire 100-150 regular 32g hunting loads then check with light target loads and if it cycles, perfect, if it doesnt do an extra 50 rounds before adjusting the gas system. in the meanwhile dont even touch the gas valve/regulator/gas nut.\n\nContemporary thought:\n\njust load two snap caps or fired/spent cartridges in the magazine tube and then simply pull the cocking handle to chamber the cartridge then dry fire then cycle the cocking handle/bolt manually as this will eject the snap cap/cartridge and will load the other one into the chamber then dry fire again and maually cycle the cocking handle/bolt. do this proceedure 100 times and you are finished with the break-in proceedure.\n\nthen go to the range, try the lighter loads, if they cycle, perfect!, if they dont, try the above mentioned proceedure again.\n\ntheoratically, i dont see a reason why this proceedure shouldnt work. as far as plain theory or mechanics is concerned, break-in is just supposed to cycle to the gun multiple time in order to settle all working parts at their desired position and grind/rub the action smooth to permit easy cycling.\n\nRegards', 0, 1, '58.65.190.68', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1189, 43868),

"THOROUGHLY" :) Information & Knowledge levels of members were challenged as well :)) The mystery of NPB & PB in terms of rifles is based on the licences issued by MOI and that issued by provincial government! Ministry Of Interior considers any calibre (OF RIFLES) above .22 (Bolt Action) as a PB!!! And for the issuance of licence there is a set proceadure where earlier Prime minister''s senction was required but later it was transfered to Interior Minister! On the other hand provincial governments i.e. Sind, Punjab & N.W.F.P. do not consider rifles as a PB but licence I beleive restricts you to carry the weapon from one province to the other! Charm of the licence issued by MOI is the permission to carry the weapon all over Pakistan. It is my knowledge so far ;) Now, this is the reason....whenever members from Capital or rawalpindi give their comments they confirm such rifles as a PB & those from Sind always take it as a NPB. I always say we have different experiences and this forum is meant to provide us a platform to share it.

GUNS are very expensive here, especially premium products like GLOCKS etc. A GLOCK 17 costs around $4000 here. This makes the ownership a very exclusive affair. Thats why Chinese 7.62 (.30 calibre) handguns & 9mm s are the most common. A chinese SIG clone costs around $500 in the local market.\n2. Ammo is also very expensive. 9mm chinese ammo costs around $45 per 100 rounds. That also makes things a lot on the up side considering our per capita income.\n3. Ranges & clubs are very few. You can say only 3 in whole of PAKISTAN. \nDespite all this GUNS are a very traditional things here. They are regarded are a MAN''s JEWELLERY. Lot of enthusiasts here prefer it over owning a nice car etc etc. Also in certain TRIBAL & remote areas where you can see a lot of guns , you will be amazed at the shooting skills the people can display.

This page refers to the usage in the United States under the previous and proposed assault weapon bans. \nAssault weapon refers to firearms that had been developed from earlier fully-automatic firearms into semi-automatic civilian-legal versions. Semi-automatic firearms, when fired, automatically extract the spent casing and load the next round into the chamber, ready to fire again; they do not fire automatically like a machine gun, rather, only 1 shot comes from each trigger pull.\n\nBy former U.S. law, the legal term assault weapon included certain specific semi-automatic firearm models by name (e.g., Colt AR-15, TEC-9, all non-automatic AK-47s, and Uzis) and other semi-automatic firearms because they possess a minimum set of features from the following list of features:\n\n \nA semi-automatic AK-47 rifle. \nAn Intratec TEC-DC9 with 32-round magazine; a semi-automatic pistol formerly classified as an Assault Weapon under Federal Law.Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and two or more of the following: \nFolding or telescoping stock \nPistol grip \nBayonet mount \nFlash suppressor, or threaded barrel designed to accommodate one \nGrenade launcher (more precisely, a muzzle device which enables the launching or firing of rifle grenades) \nSemi-automatic pistols with detachable magazines and two or more of the following: \nMagazine that attaches outside the pistol grip \nThreaded barrel to attach barrel extender, flash suppressor, handgrip, or suppressor \nBarrel shroud that can be used as a hand-hold \nUnloaded weight of 50 oz (1.4 kg) or more \nA semi-automatic version of an automatic firearm \nSemi-automatic shotguns with two or more of the following: \nFolding or telescoping stock \nPistol grip \nFixed capacity of more than 5 rounds \nDetachable magazine \nThe earlier term assault rifle refers to rifles that are capable of fully automatic fire. In contrast, the term "assault weapon" refers to weapons capable of semi-automatic fire that had those certain features, as listed above. The ban did not cover "assault rifles", but merely the new category of "assault weapons" which did not include automatic firearms of any type.\n\nThis information was a quick search in Wikipedia.', 0, 1, '58.65.183.92', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 185, 44381),

As expected the trolling did not yield much results save for a ‘cuda ,so we decided to hunker down for bottom action. Soon as we lowered the first couple of lines, we started striking phukkis and kapartans etc. in the 1 kg range which felt great on light tackle. Knowing that we were positioned correctly over structure, lines at different columns were set out with dead and live baits. Ali expertly rigged his lure with all bells and whistles which attracted fish soon as he would hit bottom. We followed suit and the game was on. At around sundown all hell broke loose! Real screamed relentlessly as these bottom dwellers went on a feeding frenzy, there was non stop action for more than two hours….the action was so exhilarating that span seems like a blur now. We started hitting ‘cudas at mid-water and bottom, they would not let anything else take bait. But then it happened, a bigger strike peeling line away, I had to quickly tighten the drag before the fish headed into the rocks. The fight lasted a few minutes and there it was in all its glory a 6 kg Red Snapper. Moments later Salman felt a nibble on a TLD-15 with a light action rod and then it took! Salman fought his first fish on light tackle beautifully and now has been initiated with great honour!! Ali not to be out done, quickly matched the ante with a Red Snapper of his own which he brought up very briskly (must be all that tuna fighting experience ;) Now that we were in a blissful state of fishing nirvana and were content with our catch, with the fish still biting strong specially cuda’s we started releasing fish.

This shape causes a rifle to recoil back - right into shooter''s face.   This stock design almost always delivers brutal recoil.   The 30-30 Win. is not a powerful caliber by any means, but just shoot one of these Winchesters, and one will feel a whole lot more recoil than he should.   It''s mostly due to this stock design.   The angle of the butt plate is another problem.   The top of the butt plate is slanted to the rear, and that causes recoil to pound the upper part of your shoulder.   This is the very worst stock design there is for comfortable shooting.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/6691/81224318.jpg[/img][/url]\nThis particular Remington stock recoils straight back.   It''s much better.\n\nNotice how the comb of this stock is perfectly parallel with the barrel.   This allows the rifle to recoil straight back along (but not into) your face.   This stock design is a major improvement, and you''ll feel a great deal less recoil with this stock design.   The angle of this butt plate is also much better than the Winchester.   It''s still slanted slightly to the rear, (but not as much) and it delivers recoil lower on your shoulder where it''s more comfortable.   A well designed recoil pad obviously reduces recoil even more.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/7797/47996581.jpg[/img][/url]\nThis type of (e.g. Weatherby) stocks are well designed, and one will feel much less recoil with this stock design.\n\nNotice how the front of the comb on this stock slopes downward.   This allows the rifle to recoil straight back, and away from your face.   This stock design also delivers recoil to your shoulder the way it should.   However, the butt plate is still not "perfectly" perpendicular to the barrel.   The top of the butt is slanted "very slightly" to the rear.   This puts recoil just a bit high on your shoulder.   Changing this angle just enough to make it perpendicular to the barrel would make the recoil feel noticably lighter, especially when shooting from the prone position or from a bench.\n\nThanx to Larry W.', 0, 1, '58.27.150.153', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1803, 44551),

Plus it’s Sunday and I’m sorta keeping myself busy or rather unavailable. ( I’m sure any married man would understand)\n\n[b]1. English Stock AKA Straight Grip or English Grip:[/b]\n\n[img]http://www.gunsinternational.com/images/listings/100036245-5-L.jpg[/img]\n\nEnglish stock was originally designed to allow quick selection of the rear trigger on a double trigger gun. The design also allowed the gun to be just a tab bit lighter, sleeker and easier to swing. Since the angle of the wrist is less awkward, the gun also becomes easier in field carry.\n\nHowever the benefits of this stock design comes at a price, the operator essentially loses right hand control over the shotgun. Meaning, the operator lets go of some of the right hand control and relies more on the left hand, the hand that grips the forend (I’m assuming the shooter is right handed). With this sort of setup, the gun becomes difficult to maneuver. During mount there is more reliance on the left hand, however after a successful mount, since there is more reliance on the left hand, the swing is more controlled.\n\n[b]2. Prince of Wales Grip AKA Pistol Grip or Modified Pistol Grip:[/b]\n\n[img]http://www.gunsinternational.com/images/listings/100086136-3-L.jpg[/img]\n\nThe fact that most people call it pistol grip is wrong, it is actually modified pistol, originated by the prince of Wales who was weak in the right hand, he desired more control in the right hand therefore the modified pistol grip was born.\n\nWhile it is true that forehand is highly important in moving the barrel with the bird, the rear hand is equally important in maintaining gun mount and trigger control. Neither hand is more important. One hand should not be weakened just to improve the importance of the other.\n\nI’m sure by now you must have guessed that semi pistol or Prince of Wales grip takes some of the control from the left and puts it in the right hand. Therefore permits a more controlled mount, more authority over the trigger and increased maneuverability. Why it got popular? Hmmm.... quiet simple, the gain in the right hand control is greater than the loss in the control of the left hand. To put it short, gain in right hand control = huge, loss in left hand control = insignificant.\n\nThis type of grip proved to be quiet popular among hunters and sport shooters alike as it results in a more controlled mount, more control over the triggers, more maneuverability of the gun along with an excellent swing. A testimony to the success of a modified pistol grip is that English stocks are practically on the endangered species list in the sporting events around the globe.

Kindly go through my answers in Bold.\n\n[quote=OnTarget9]Greetings!\n\nI am looking to acquire a ‘concealed carry’ (for SD and sport) 9mm pistol that is reliable, accurate and safe. I would welcome your views/advice.[b]If you are going for SD/Sport then you dont need a weapon that should be CCW. Your location says Dubai so if you are planning to use it in Pakistan then i would recommend you PT92/99 from Taurus. Its a very tried and tested Hand Gun and i have used it with every kind of ammo without any issues. Other Taurus Hand Guns are Ammo Sensitive.[/b]\n\nI would prefer something that can be carried in an ankle holster. If the Glock 19 were not so obscenely overpriced in Pak, I would have preferred that. At the moment, I am thinking of Stoeger Cougar. Though, I am not sure if it would work with an ankle holster (any views on that?). What would be better alternatives in your opinion?.[b]If you are thinking about using an Ankle Holster then you better gear up for a dissapointment as they are nothing but Shashka and that is the end of that. No matter how good is the Ankle Holster, you will not be comfortable with it. Stoeger is not good for Ankle stuff. Othe ralternative is Taurus 609 which is readily available in market for around 50 to 60K but do read my Topic Another Taurus Failure before you make up your mind as again its Ammo Sensitive.[/b]\n\nI do not want to spend too much over a 100K but can be flexible.[b]Flexibility to another 10 or 20 K will get you no where so you are btter off buying a Taurus which will cost you much less. Flexibility to around another 100K is a different issue as that will open up many possibilities.[/b]\n\n-----------------------\n\nAny views on availability in Karachi (of Stoeger or others that you may recommend) and price would be very welcome, as well.[b]Stoeger and almost all models of Taurus are readily available in Karachi and are priced around the point i mentioned above. You should do some searching when you are shopping[/b]\nAlso, what ammo would you recommend (Chinese/POF/other?). I anticipate shooting 300-400 rounds a month so nothing too expensive, yet don’t want to damage gun (or lose a finger), either.[b]Chinese is your best bet in this regard as its cheap and also doesnt hurt your weapon[/b]\n\n-------------------------\nPS In 9mm handguns, I only have experience (about 1500 rounds) with a CZ 75 and was happy with its accuracy and recoil.\nPPS Just out of curiosity, what is the price of a Glock 19 or 26 in Pak? What is availability like?[b]Glock 19 is avilable from 220 to 275K and its avilability is quite a lot at almost all dealers. Glock 26 is aroound 300 to 340K but its not that easily available at dealers.[/b]\n\nNow after all is said and done, my personal recomendation to you just like Dr. Zakir and Glocky is to go for a Glock 26. I own it and you can never go wrong with it. Get a 12 Round Magazine with it and it will be great for CC and also your Sports purpose. But hey this is my opinion. If you are hard pressed for money or dont want to spend 300K on a Hand Gun then you already know what to buy.[/quote]\n\n[b]A.A[/b]', 0, 1, '119.152.38.235', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1802, 44801),

But we get the same with 9:45 or8:20 or some other time. Then why is it 10:10 ?\n\n2) Smiley Look: When we look at a watch at 10:10, we see as if the watch is smiling. It is better to have a smiling face, rather than having a crying face when the time is at 8:20. Well that is one good reason, since it enlightens peoples mind while looking at the ad.\n\n3) Victory: When the clock is at 10:10, the hands are similar to the letter "v" which symbolises victory. May not be the actual reason, but we can say this as one of the reasons.\n\n4) Abraham Lincoln: Many say that it is due to Abraham Lincoln died at that time and so the watches are showing 10:10. But some say that, Lincoln is shot at night at around 10:15, and died in the next day morning at around 7:22. So this ain''t the correct the reason.\n\n[b]5) Visibility: When the hands are at 10:10, we have the makers name and other details (if any) clearly visible when they are placed at above or below the center.[/b]\n\n6) First Watch: Some say that first watch is made/completed at that time. But why are most companies adopting it ? and in fact clocks are been around for many 100s of years. So this aint the reason.\n\n7) Hiroshima and Nagasaki Attack: Few say, it is because during that time, first atomic bomb was used and in remembrance of all the victimes, all unused clocks or the clocks which are presented in show-cases have the same time of 10:10. But it seems the practise of 10:10 has been in there from 1920s.

New, used, doesn''t matter, you want a good one, right?\n\nHow do check one over without firing it, right at the dealer''s counter or gun show table?\n\nThis is how. All of this works with DA or SA wheelguns..."close the action" on most DAs means swing the cylinder in, on SA types, close the loading gate, on breakopens, close ''em. UNLOADED.\n\nWARNING: most of these tests require violation of the "finger off trigger" rule. Therefore, be extremely careful about safe muzzle direction and making sure the gun is unloaded ahead of time, PERSONALLY, as you begin handling it.\n\nNote: bring a small flashlight, something small and concentrated. A Photon or similar high-powered LED light is perfect. You also want feeler gauges if you''re not used to eyeballing cylinder gaps; at a minimum, bring a .002", .004" and .006".\n\nNote2: no dry firing is required or desired at any point. It just pisses off the gun''s current owner.\n\nCylinder play.\n\n1) With the gun UNLOADED (check for yourself!), close the action.\n\n2) Thumb the hammer back, and while pulling the trigger, gently lower the hammer all the way down while keeping the trigger back - and KEEP holding the trigger once the hammer is down. (You''ve now put the gun in "full lockup" - keep it there for this and most other tests.)\n\n3) With the trigger still back all the way, check for cylinder wiggle. Front/back is particularly undesirable; a bit of side to side is OK but it''s a bad thing if you can wiggle it one way, let go, and then spin it the other way a fraction of an inch and it stays there too. At the very least, it should "want" to stop in just one place (later, we''ll see if that place is any good). The ultimate is a "welded to the frame" feeling.\n\nCylinder gap\n\n4) Still holding the trigger at full lockup, look sideways through the barrel/cylinder gap. If you can get a credit card in there, that ain''t good...velocity drops rapidly as the gap increases. Too tight isn''t good either, because burnt powder crud will "fill the gap" and start making the cylinder spin funky. My personal .38snubbie is set at .002, usually considered the minimum...after about 40 shots at the range, I have to give the front of the cylinder a quick wipe so it spins free again. I consider that a reasonable tradeoff for the increased velocity because in a real fight, I ain''t gonna crank 40 rounds out of a 5-shot snub .\n\nIf you''re eyeballing it, you''ll have to hold it up sideways against an overhead light source.\n\nSAFETY WARNING: This step in particular is where you MUST watch your muzzle direction. Look, part of what''s happening here is that you''re convincing the seller you know your poop . It helps the haggling process. If you do anything unsafe, that impression comes completely unglued.\n\nTiming\n\n5) You really, REALLY want an unloaded gun for this one. This is where the light comes in. With the gun STILL held in full lockup, trigger back after lowering the hammer by thumb, you want to shine a light right into the area at the rear of the cylinder near the firing pin. You then look down the barrel . You''re looking to make sure the cylinder bore lines up with the barrel. Check every cylinder - that means putting the gun in full lockup for each cylinder before lighting it up.\n\nYou''re looking for the cylinder and barrel holes to line up perfectly, it''s easy to eyeball if there''s even a faint light source at the very rear of both bores. And with no rounds present, it''s generally easy to get some light in past where the rims would be.\n\nBore\n\n(We''re finally done with that "full lockup" crap, so rest your trigger finger. )\n\n6) Swing the cylinder open, or with most SAs pull the cylinder. Use the small flashlight to scope the bore out. This part''s easy - you want to avoid pitting, worn-out rifling, bulges of any sort. You want more light on the subject than just what creeps in from the rear of the cylinder on the timing check.\n\nYou also want to check each cylinder bore, in this case with the light coming in from the FRONT of each hole, you looking in from the back where the primers would be. You''re looking for wear at the "restrictions" at the front of each cylinder bore. That''s the "forcing cone" area and it can wear rapidly with some Magnum loads. (Special thanks to Salvo below for this bit!)\n\nTrigger\n\n7) To test a trigger without dry-firing it, use a plastic pen in front of the hammer to "catch" it with the off hand, especially if it''s a "firing pin on the hammer" type. Or see if the seller has any snap-caps, that''s the best solution. Flat-faced hammers as found in transfer-bar guns (Ruger, etc) can be caught with the off-hand without too much pain .\n\nSA triggers (or of course a DA with the hammer cocked) should feel "like a glass rod breaking". A tiny amount of take-up slack is tolerable, and is common on anything with a transfer bar or hammerblock safety.\n\nDA triggers are subjective. Some people like a dead-smooth feel from beginning of stroke to the end, with no "warning" that it''s about to fire. Others (myself included) actually prefer a slight "hitch" right at the end, so we know when it''s about to go. With that sort of trigger, you can actually "hold it" right at the "about to fire" point and do a short light stroke from there that rivals an SA shot for accuracy. Takes a lot of practice though. Either way, you don''t want "grinding" through the length of the stroke, and the final stack-up at the end (if any) shouldn''t be overly pronounced.\n\nDetecting Bad Gunsmithing:\n\n8) OK, so it''s got a rock-solid cylinder, a .002" or .003" gap, and the trigger feels great. Odds are vastly in favor of it being tuned after leaving the factory.\n\nSo was the gunsmith any good?\n\nFirst, cock it, then grab the hammer and "wiggle it around" a bit. Not too hard, don''t bang on it, but give it a bit of up/down, left/right and circular action with finger off trigger and WATCH your muzzle direction.\n\nYou don''t want that hammer slipping off an overly polished sear. You REALLY don''t want that . It can be fixed by installing factory parts but that''ll take modest money (more for installation than hardware costs) and it''ll be bigtime unsafe until you do.\n\nThe other thing that commonly goes wrong is somebody will trim the spring, especially coil springs. You can spot that if you pull the grip panels, see if the spring was trimmed with wire cutters. If they get too wild with it, you''ll get ignition failures on harder primers. But the good news is, replacement factory or Wolf springs are cheap both to buy and have installed.\n\nThere''s also the legal problems Ayoob frequently describes regarding light triggers. If that''s a concern, you can either swap back to stock springs, or since you bought it used there''s no way to prove you knew it was modified at all .\n\nIn perspective:\n\nTiming (test #5) is very critical...if that''s off, the gun may not even be safe to test-fire. And naturally, a crappy barrel means a relatively pricey fix.\n\nCylinder gap is particularly critical on short-barreled and/or marginal caliber guns. If you need every possible ounce of energy, a tight gap helps. Some factory gaps will run as high as .006"; Taurus considers .007" "still in spec" (sigh). You''ll be hard-pressed to find any new pieces under .004" - probably because the makers realize some people don''t clean ''em often (or very well) and might complain about the cylinder binding up if they sell ''em at .002".\n\nThe guns in a dealer''s "used pile" are often of unknown origin, from estate sales or whatever. Dealers don''t have time to check every piece, and often don''t know their history. These tests, especially cyliner gap and play, can spot a gun that''s been sent off for professional tuning...like my snubbie, the best $180 I ever spent .\n\nAs long as the gun is otherwise sound (no cracks, etc) a gunsmith can fix any of this. So these tests can help you pick a particularly good new specimen, or find a good used gun, or help haggle the price down on something that''ll need a bit of work.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nJim[/quote]', 0, 1, '94.172.135.13', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1816, 45302),

I think a carpenter and wielder worth of two days work each and about Rs. 7000 worth of materials should do the trick.[/quote]\n\nAbass Bhai, it looks like a neat thing but dont want to sound like a party pooper (nor want to rain on this parade) but here are some of my concerns:\n\n1. a simple wooden gun cabinet costs 7K-10K as i''ve made two myself, one for me, one for my best friend''s elder brother. from wooden i''m not  talking about real wood, i''m talking engineered wood (chipboard, plywood, my preference sheesham chipboard/plywood). therefore I dont think one could make a steel bed with 10 gauge sheets with a materials budget of 10K\n\n2. initially before moving on to gun cabinets, i was strictly a gun chest (made that myself as well) kinda person, fully enclosed space and sealed with guns neatly packed together fully assembled. but any guy who uses gun chests knows the menace of humidity and its adverse effects on steel. guns rust pretty easily in a humid and dark environment. some organism even grow on wooden gun parts if kept for long in dark and humid environment. solutions require constant heat/light source in the chest and its a real pain in the neck. otherwise options are to put silicone gels in the gun chest but then again they require periodical changing.\n\n3. when even long guns are placed/stored flat against any surface, they have a tendency to bend after extended storage duration.\n\n4. bolting all metal parts together will not work either, upon closer inspection it looks that sheet metal has been bent (process: SHEET METAL BENDING) and corners welded together, this would require services of an industrial welder, ordinary "TUCH" WELDERS are not upto the task.\n\n5. if u look at the bed closely, it looks like the bed shifts to make enough room for the gun safe''s door to open.  moving such a bed would require desigining of ball bearing which will have to move on a ramp, otherwise the bed will simply slide off to the other side.\n\n6. safe''s door construction seems to be of a typical hinge type, double sheet, internal lock mechanism, very difficult to custom make as it requires alot of technical know how.\n\nConsidering all these, I would say: given the lack of technical expertise, lack of economies of scale (which reduces price of such an item as specialized machines/tools are created to do a difficult job with ease), lack of materials available. designing/making such a thing would easily cross 100-150K.\n\nRegards\n\np.s. incase u guys wondering what kinda gun cabinet i can make. well... i''m no professional however since i love woodwork and tend to be very careful with my calculations (ok i admit I usually solicit the services of a maths genius cousin of mine), the projects turn out not too bad (if i do say so myself).\n\nhere it is, this one I''ve recently made like 2 months ago (for my friend''s elder brother).\n\nstorage space: 8 guns\nMaterial: all 3/4inch sheesham plywood construction (all sides/walls made of 0.75inch sheet of sheesham plywood, back/bottom/top, resulting in a much solid contruction)\nentry: sliding glass (tempered glass) locked by simple sliding glass lock\nbottom storage: simple pull down type door, with round knobs, lock and key setup\npriority: to keep the overall profile down, I had to exclude skirting and crown.\nTotal Cost: 8K (all materials as i did everything myself, except glass fixing). for polishing/varnish/paint/sealing, add another 2K.\n\n[img]http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/6870/32877225.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/981/74973036.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/4422/61192676.jpg[/img]\n\nRegards', 0, 1, '58.65.151.102', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1821, 45384),

The committee was informed that interior ministry had issued 28,527 licences for weapons of prohibited bore from March 28, 2008, to June 26, 2009, and 6,000 of them were approved by Minister of State for Interior Tasneem Qureshi in May and June this year. \n\nThe number of such licences may be higher because most of the record is missing. The government is trying to ascertain the number of licences issued in violation of rules. \n\nIn a major breach of official procedure, a server provided by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to check the identity of applicants was replaced by one sent by a private vendor, the investigators said. \n\nThey said that officials did not maintain record in order to conceal the number of licences issued and the identity of those who acquired prohibited lethal arms. \n\nPages from the Arms Endorsement Register were removed and the investigators found it difficult to ascertain how many applications had been processed without approval by the competent authority. \n\nOnly Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is authorised to issue licences of prohibited bore but he delegated the power to the minister of state on April 4 this year. \n\nAfter receiving complaints from various quarters, including parliamentarians, about licences of prohibited weapons being issued without meeting the required formalities, the prime minister ordered the ministry on June 26 to stop issuing the permits and asked the standing committee to look into the matter. \n\nThe committee, according to its chairman Abdul Qadir Patel, was not satisfied with the pace and outcome of the inquiry. He said the committee had called for action to bring the culprits to book. \n\nHe said the committee had asked the ministry to explain why such a large number of permits had been issued after approval by the minister of state in just two months. \n\nHe said the committee had also asked the ministry to see if the number of licences issued tallied with the number approved.', 0, 1, '202.79.203.51', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 536, 45728),

The committee was informed that interior ministry had issued 28,527 licences for weapons of prohibited bore from March 28, 2008, to June 26, 2009, and 6,000 of them were approved by Minister of State for Interior Tasneem Qureshi in May and June this year.\n\nThe number of such licences may be higher because most of the record is missing. The government is trying to ascertain the number of licences issued in violation of rules.\n\nIn a major breach of official procedure, a server provided by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to check the identity of applicants was replaced by one sent by a private vendor, the investigators said.\n\nThey said that officials did not maintain record in order to conceal the number of licences issued and the identity of those who acquired prohibited lethal arms.\n\nPages from the Arms Endorsement Register were removed and the investigators found it difficult to ascertain how many applications had been processed without approval by the competent authority.\n\nOnly Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is authorised to issue licences of prohibited bore but he delegated the power to the minister of state on April 4 this year.\n\nAfter receiving complaints from various quarters, including parliamentarians, about licences of prohibited weapons being issued without meeting the required formalities, the prime minister ordered the ministry on June 26 to stop issuing the permits and asked the standing committee to look into the matter.\n\nThe committee, according to its chairman Abdul Qadir Patel, was not satisfied with the pace and outcome of the inquiry. He said the committee had called for action to bring the culprits to book.\n\nHe said the committee had asked the ministry to explain why such a large number of permits had been issued after approval by the minister of state in just two months.\n\nHe said the committee had also asked the ministry to see if the number of licences issued tallied with the number approved.\n\n\nfrom the Dawn News Daily', 0, 1, '202.163.71.194', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1846, 45758),

However, pressure from local authorities forced the captain to steer the ship away from the coast. The captain tried to get help from the French and Portuguese authorities, but they too ordered the ship away from their shores. The storm eventually took its toll on the ship resulting in the tanker splitting in half and releasing 20 million gallons oil into the sea.\nAccording to a report by the Pontevedra Economist Board, the total cleanup cost $12 billion. \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img239.imageshack.us/img239/3294/91176751.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n# 02. Space Shuttle Columbia - $13 Billion\nThe Space Shuttle Columbia was the first space worthy shuttle in NASA''s orbital fleet. It was destroyed during re-entry over Texas on February 1, 2003 after a hole was punctured in one of the wings during launch 16 days earlier. The original cost of the shuttle was $2 Billion in 1978. That comes out to $6.3 Billion in today''s dollars. $500 million was spent on the investigation, making it the costliest aircraft accident investigation in history. The search and recovery of debris cost $300 million. \n\nIn the end, the total cost of the accident (not including replacement of the shuttle) came out to $13 Billion according to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img239.imageshack.us/img239/8655/32554259.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n# 01. Chernobyl - $200 Billion\nOn April 26, 1986, the world witnessed the costliest accident in history. The Chernobyl disaster has been called the biggest socio-economic catastrophe in peacetime history. 50% of the area of Ukraine is in some way contaminated. Over 200,000 people had to be evacuated and resettled while 1.7 million people were directly affected by the disaster. The death toll attributed to Chernobyl , including people who died from cancer years later, is estimated at 125,000. The total costs including cleanup, resettlement, and compensation to victims has been estimated to be roughly $200 Billion. The cost of a new steel shelter for the Chernobyl nuclear plant will cost $2 billion alone. The accident was officially attributed to power plant operators who violated plant procedures and were ignorant of the safety requirements needed.   \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqYJGK9][img]http://img125.imageshack.us/img125/903/65568445.th.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '203.81.229.174', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1848, 45787),

For those beginners interested in using the outdoors there is unlimited information on wilderness survival skills and equipment available. However, experience is the best teacher in any outdoor situation and your reaction in a wilderness survival situation depends on your education. Always keep in mind that it can happen to you. Those who are mentally and physically prepared to survive are more likely to do so. To deal with an emergency situation one must be able to make decisions, improvise and remain calm. \n\nFear - For anyone faced with a wilderness emergency survival situation, fear is a normal reaction. Unless an emergency situation has been anticipated, fear is generally followed by panic then pain, cold, thirst, hunger, fatigue, boredom and loneliness. It is extremely important to calmly assess the situation and not allow these seven enemies to interfere with your survival. \n\nPain - Pain may often be ignored in a panic situation. Remember to deal with injuries immediately before they become even more serious. \n\nCold - Cold lowers the ability to think, numbing the body and reducing the will to survive. Never allow yourself to stop moving or to fall asleep unless adequately sheltered. \n\nThirst - Dehydration is a common enemy in an emergency situation and must not be ignored. It can dull your mind, causing you to overlook important survival information. \n\nHunger - Hunger is dangerous but seldom deadly. It may reduce your ability to think logically and increase your susceptibility to the effects of cold, pain and fear. \n\nFatigue - Fatigue is unavoidable in any situation so it is best to keep in mind that it can and will lower your mental ability. Remember that in an emergency situation this is often the bodies way of escaping a difficult situation. \n\nBoredom & Loneliness - These enemies are quite often unanticipated and may lower the mind''s ability to deal with the situation. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW TO: \n\nBuild a Fire\nBuilding a fire is the most important task when dealing with survival in the wilderness. Be sure to build yours in a sandy or rocky area or near a supply of sand and water as to avoid forest fires. The most common mistakes made by those attempting to build a fire are: choosing poor tinder, failing to shield precious matches from the wind and smothering the flames with too large pieces of fuel. The four most important factors when starting a fire are spark - tinder - fuel - oxygen. \n\nThe most common ways to create spark are: \n\n \n\n1. Waterproof, strike-anywhere matches are your best bet. Matches may be water-proofed by dipping them in nail polish. Store your matches in a waterproof container. \n\n2. A cigarette lighter is also a good way to produce a spark, with or without fuel. \n\n3. The flint and steel method is one of the oldest and most reliable methods in fire starting. Aim the sparks at a pile of dry tinder to produce a fire. \n\n4. The electric spark produced from a battery will ignite a gasoline dampened rag. \n\n5. Remove half of the powder from a bullet and pour it into the tinder. Next place a rag in the cartridge case of the gun and fire. The rag should ignite and then may be placed into the tinder. \n\n6. Allow the suns rays to pass through a magnifying glass onto the tinder. \n\nDry grass, paper or cloth lint, gasoline-soaked rags and dry bark are all forms of tinder. Place your tinder in a small pile resembling a tepee with the driest pieces at the bottom. Use a fire starter or strip of pitch if it is available. \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that smaller pieces of kindling such as, twigs, bark, shavings and gasoline, are necessary when trying to ignite larger pieces of fuel. Gather fuel before attempting to start your fire. Obviously dry wood burns better and wet or pitchy wood will create more smoke. Dense, dry wood will burn slow and hot. A well ventilated fire will burn best. \n\n Build a Shelter\nA small shelter which is insulated from the bottom, protected from wind and snow and contains a fire is extremely important in wilderness survival. Before building your shelter be sure that the surrounding area provides the materials needed to build a good fire, a good water source and shelter from the wind. \n\nWilderness shelters may include: \n\n1. Natural shelters such as caves and overhanging cliffs. When exploring a possible shelter tie a piece of string to the outer mouth of the cave to ensure you will be able to find your way out. Keep in mind that these caves may already be occupied. If you do use a cave for shelter, build your fire near its mouth to prevent animals from entering. \n\n2. Enlarge the natural pit under a fallen tree and line it with bark or tree boughs. \n\n3. Near a rocky coastal area, build a rock shelter in the shape of a U, covering the roof with driftwood and a tarp or even seaweed for protection. \n\n \n\n4. A lean-to made with poles or fallen trees and a covering of plastic, boughs, thick grasses or bark is effective to shelter you from wind, rain and snow. \n\n \n\n5. A wigwam may be constructed using three long poles. Tie the tops of the poles together and upright them in an appropriate spot. Cover the sides with a tarp, boughs, raingear or other suitable materials. Build a fire in the center of the wigwam, making a draft channel in the wall and a small hole in the top to allow smoke to escape. \n\n \n\n6. If you find yourself in open terrain, a snow cave will provide good shelter. Find a drift and burrow a tunnel into the side for about 60 cm (24 in) then build your chamber. The entrance of the tunnel should lead to the lowest level of you chamber where the cooking and storage of equipment will be. A minimum of two ventilating holes are necessary, preferably one in the roof and one in the door. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT \n\nClothing\nClothing must provide warmth and offer protection from the elements. Layers of light, natural fibers are best. Hats are a must, as they offer protection from both the heat and cold. Water proof outer layers are necessary. \n\nEquipment\nEquipment must be easily manageable and promote survival in any situation. Items to carry in your pockets may include a fire starter, waterproof matches and/or lighter, a pocket knife, goggles, compass, small first-aid kit and some sort of trail food. \n\nSurvival Kit\nItems for your survival kit should be packed in a waterproof container that can double as a cooking pot and water receptacle and be attached to your belt. \n\n \n\nBackpack\nIn addition to a survival kit, a good, comfortable backpack is mandatory. Loads of about 18 kg (40 lb.) are average. Items to include are; flashlight, extra jacket, socks and mittens, a pocket saw, gas camp stove, first aid kit, emergency food, and a tent and fly. \n\nCHECK LIST \n\nUseful items to include on your hike are:\n\n1. A map and compass.\n\n2. A large, bright plastic bag will be useful as a shelter, signaling device or in lieu of raingear.\n\n3. A flashlight with extra batteries.\n\n4. Extra water and food.\n\n5. Extra clothing such as raingear, a toque and gloves, a sweater and pants.\n\n6. Sun protection such as sunglasses, sunscreen, a hat and long sleeved clothing.\n\n\n\n7. A sharp pocket knife.\n\n8. Waterproof matches, a lighter and/or a flint.\n\n9. Candles and fire starter.\n\n10. A first aid kit.\n\n11. A whistle, flares, a tarp. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore venturing into the wilderness check weather forecasts and hazards.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img372.imageshack.us/img372/9710/88687502.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/Pq139wNA.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/4629/12818830.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/4004/87317831.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/446/89694950.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/5594/98739016.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img372.imageshack.us/img372/1660/60340458.gif[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '203.82.55.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1858, 45979),

I''m 25 this year. I''m very pretty, have style and good taste. I wish to marry a guy with $500k annual salary or above. You might say that I''m greedy, but an annual salary of $1M is considered only as middle class in New York. My requirement is not high. Is there anyone in this forum who has an income of $500k annual salary? Are you all married? I wanted to ask: what should I do to marry rich persons like you? Among those I''ve dated, the richest is $250k annual income, and it seems that this is my upper limit. If someone is going to move into high cost residential area on the west of New York CityGarden(?), $250k annual income is not enough. \n\nI''m here humbly to ask a few questions: \n1) Where do most rich bachelors hang out? (Please list down the names and addresses of bars, restaurant, gym) \n2) Which age group should I target? \n3) Why most wives of the riches is only average-looking? I''ve met a few girls who doesn''t have looks and are not interesting, but they are able to marry rich guys \n4) How do you decide who can be your wife, and who can only be your girlfriend? (my target now is to get married) \n\nMs. Pretty \n\nAwesome reply: \nDear Ms. Pretty, \n\nI have read your post with great interest. Guess there are lots of girls out there who have similar questions like yours. Please allow me to analyse your situation as a professional investor. My annual income is more than $500k, which meets your requirement, so I hope everyone believes that I''m not wasting time here. From the standpoint of a business person, it is a bad decision to marry you. The answer is very simple, so let me explain. Put the details aside, what you''re trying to do is an exchange of "beauty" and "money": Person A provides beauty, and Person B pays for it, fair and square. However, there''s a deadly problem here, your beauty will fade, but my money will not be gone without any good reason. The fact is, my income might increase from year to year, but you can''t be prettier year after year. Hence from the viewpoint of economics, I am an appreciation asset, and you are a depreciation asset. It''s not just normal depreciation, but exponential depreciation. If that is your only asset, your value will be much worried 10 years later. \n\nBy the terms we use in Wall Street, every trading has a position, dating with you is also a "trading position". If the trade value dropped we will sell it and it is not a good idea to keep it for long term - same goes with the marriage that you wanted. It might be cruel to say this, but in order to make a wiser decision any assets with great depreciation value will be sold or "leased". Anyone with over $500k annual income is not a fool; we would only date you, but will not marry you. I would advice that you forget looking for any clues to marry a rich guy. And by the way, you could make yourself to become a rich person with $500k annual income. This has better chance than finding a rich fool. \n\nHope this reply helps.

I''ve used DSA pump with 14 inch barrels. same standard receiver, same pistol grip, shorter forend, shorter barrel (ofcourse), cylinder bore (otherwise DSA usually makes modified choked barrels).\n\nallow me to explain what i felt after firing a couple of cartridges at the DSA factory in Peshawar.\n\n1. muzzle blast is absolutely horrible (looks like a dragon spitting a huge ball of fire)\n2. loud bang/noise (perfect if u want to lose ur hearing ability before u hit 40)\n3. pattern, well, its cylinder bore on a 14 inch barrel, so what can u expect, its pretty wide for a shotgun. keep in mind that this is the exact plan here.\n4. stout recoil, shorter barrel reduces the weight, hence unable to soak up recoil.\n\nin my experience, as a car carry weapon, weilded by a designated person, its spot on perfect. but for the driver its not. cause a driver cannot hold the weapon and drive at the same time. for that purpose, i would suggest a pistol. the weapon though alot smaller than a regular shotgun, is still quiet large for a car carrry weapon (specially for the driver). large weapons are the slowest to draw, when anticipating a fire fight. one more thing, the limited magazine capacity is such a turn off.\n\nSummary:\n\nfor car carry, its fine as long as u get somebody else to hold it. but for the driver alone to handle such a thing and drive at the same time. its quiet useless IMHO.\n\nRegards.', 0, 1, '58.65.191.148', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1856, 46206),

Navigation by the stars is an old method that is still useful, assuming the sky is clear. Mariners have used celestial navigation for thousands of years.\n\n\nNorth Star\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, the location of north can be determined by the North Star. The North Star, also known as the Pole star, is a valuable navigation aid because it''s located almost above polar north. The North star is not a very bright star, but unlike the other stars, it remains at a fixed location in the sky.\n\nIn finding the North Star, the Big Dipper (Ursa Major) and Cassiopeia (shaped like a W) are helpful. Neither of these constellations ever sets and they are always visible on a clear night, however, they are not always in the same place. The position of the stars in the sky depends on the time, date and geographical position (latitude and longitude). You probably have noticed how stars appear to move across the sky during the night. The reason for that is due to the Earth''s rotation around its axis. That''s also the reason the sun moves across the sky in the day. That means the picture you see on this page probably does not match the sky you are viewing, but that is an easy fix as you can just rotate the image.\n\nTo locate north:\n\n• Find the Big Dipper in the sky. Follow the edge of the cup 5 times its length toward a medium bright star. You have found the North Star, which is virtually north.\n\n• To double check that it’s really the North Star, locate Cassiopeia. The North Star resides halfway between Cassiopeia and the Big Dipper.\n\n\nSky maps\n\nSky maps show the positions of stars in the sky at a certain day, time and the latitude and longitude of your observing location. Stars appear to move across the sky during the night because of the Earth’s rotation around its axis. That''s also the reason the sun moves across the sky in the day. There are many types of sky maps, and it requires a bit of explanation to use it. Are you new to sky maps, read this.\n\n\nWhat does the sky look like where you are?\n\nDo you want to find out? First you need to know the latitude and longitude of your location.\n\nNow, when you know your geographical position and how to read a sky map, create a sky map adaptable to your location.\n\n\nCelestial navigation\n\n \nCelestial navigation is more than just finding the North Star. Do you want to learn more, read the book "Stars". This book has a lot if interesting information and a very good layout. Complete with charts and an atlas of the entire sky. Details of all 88 constellations of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Usable anywhere in the world. This pocket sized version fits easily in your backpack including your pocket. Ideal for practical observation.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/Pq19NZnr.jpg[/img][/url]', 0, 1, '203.82.55.18', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1858, 46280),

I''m speaking from a purely theoretical point of view.. reality is not always the same as theory.. So I could be wrong and hopefully someone will correct me here if wrong.\n\nOne thing though.. with rimmed cartridges such as the 9mm etc, putting the bullet or the case directed into the chamber and slamming home the bolt or slide is not good for the extractor.. since it is hard steel (usually) and slamming it means the extractor has to slide over the rim. Hard steel being brittle.. well you can imagine the rest I suppose.. So try wherever possible to load it through a magazine. Although chances are that nothing will happen to it, but considering our lack of access to spare parts and weapons being on the expensive side, I figure why take a chance..

I have never seen any Mak jam, but cannot say that about the TT.\n\nThe Mak also has a much easier and faster field stripping procedure.  It is way better than the TT or the PPK with the 9x18 round offering better performance than the .380 and less penetration than the .30 TT without the excessive penetration.  And the bullet will make a bigger hole.  \n\nIt is a much safer pistol, with a proper safety and de cocker (and DA/SA).  Safety also locks the slide, making it easier for holster less carry.  Barrel is fixed like the PPK, so accuracy is up to you.  You can also swap the barrel for a .380, but this is more difficult to procure.\n\nThe Makarov PM is available in Pakistan in Russian, Chinese and Pakistani versions (quality in decending order).  They are obviously not as common as the ubiquitous TT, but are present in the market.  \n\nIf you get a chance to buy one, do so.[/quote]\n\ncougarman: i totaly agree with you on this post, the [b]mak is a wonderful pistol, safe , very good for SD[/b] and all.\nbut these are the [b]exact[/b] reasons why i consider this NOT to be like the AK :)\nconsider these:\nDo you think ak was meant to be on the defensive side or the offensive one?\ndo you think the ak round was meant NOT to overpenetrate?\nwhat is the price of a third party manufacture mak compared to TT? (similarly what is the price of AK compared to others like say an m16?)\nwhat is the price of a mak round compared to TT? (and what is the price of an AK round compared to other riffles))?\nHow easily can you get a mak round and how easily can you get a tt round?\ncan you get a mak in tanzania? somalia? eastern europe? more easily than a TT?\nis the mak cheaper to manufacture or is TT cheaper to manufacture?\nhave you seen a gorrila fighter in africa carry maks?\nAre there more Maks in the world than the TT? \n\nThese are the reasons why i consider TT to be the AK of pistols. Its NOT mean to be safe, its meant to be ready to fire at all times. its meant to be more powerful than most handguns out there (without caring about over penetration). its meant to be cheap and easily manufactured. its round is readily available and is cheap as well, plus its everywhere just like the AK.\n\nAK is meant to be a rugged, overpowered and cheap assault riffle. so is the TT. Mak is all things finesse.\n \nAgain, i consider Mak to be a [b]better[/b] pistol than the TT. its very safe, reliable, easy to carry and all. The best part is, it has a certain finesse which TT doesnt. and thats exactly why its not comparable to the AK. \n\nIn simple words, AK and TT consider quantity to be a better option than quality. Mak focuses a bit more on quality and finesse.\nin the words of Joseph stalin, "Quantity has a quality all its own" :)\ni hope i make my point of view clear and dont take me wrong i [b]agree with you[/b] that the Mak is a better pistol and is definitely what i would like to have if given the option between a TT and Mak.\nHaving said all this, I totally respect your opinion as well :)', 0, 1, '119.152.48.46', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1840, 46287),

To avoid problems, we over pay them but only when we have foreigners with us but in case of poor Pakistanis ... they show no mercy ... ! All other items of the treks are managable ! \n\nI''m lucky to have been to Concordia over six times while escorting with my treks & expeditions but I can''t forget my solo trek which I did in Oct 88 with 01 cook & 6 porters and this is was the firs time I carried no weight on my back.

(40248, 1382, 39930, 'GamezBond', 950, '', 1249203306, '@Abu Hafs\nHmm, You probably know, there are two categories here in the UK. one is for rifles (where the barrel is rifled) including rim fire and centre fire (.22, .243 winchester etc etc), and the other one for Shot guns, including 12g, 20g, .410 (all smooth bores).\nWe need a FAC for the first category. and a SGC for the 2nd. If the airgun is above 12ft/lb then it also falls under the first category, and we need an FAC (as it also has a rifled barrel).\nI hold SGC for the shotty. The Rapid7 is currently under 12ft/lb. Easily tunable up to about 30ft/lb if you have FAC. So as my airguns are under 12ft/lb an FAC is not needed for them.\nIndeed a standard air rifle (I think you meant under 12ft/lb) is more than enough to take rabbits at under and up to 40 yards. Both my air guns are under 12ft/lb and are deadly accurate (deadly for the rabbits ;) ) and will happily take lethal head shots upto 40 yards. Same goes for pigeons. Rapid is a lot more accurate due to having virtually no recoil on it. It can take pigeons upto 50 yards without any issues as long as you get an accurate head shot. Pigeon head is a lot less solid than a rabbits head :)\n\nAs you say, I would also go down and see how much land he has, and how far it is from any public roads etc as well as whats there in terms of game.\n\nYou dont need a permit to hunt on private land. But if I was you, I would first get a written permission from the owner. because if you get pulled over even by the traffic police guys, and they find an airgun in the boot of your car (and a knife too) then you may get done for carrying a FIREARM on a public road if you have no justification for it. And if you get caught on the private land (in case a neighbouring farmer or member of public complains that there is an Asian bloke carrying a rifle) then the police will definitely turn up and require proof that you are allowed to shoot on that land. Then th written permission will come VERY handy. They will also give your air gun a FREE thorough check to see if it is above 12ft/lb. But anyway, once you have the permission, and are looking for what gun to buy, I can probably provide you info at that stage for tuning and making sure you are legal. It is more important to stay legal than have a few extra yards in the killing range :)\n\nWebley is an excellent brand. Ever since I first tried Webley Vulcan MK II about 10 years ago, I fell in love with that gun so much that I took one to Lahore and gifted it to my younger brother. He was a kid at the time. I also converted it to take the gas strut instead of the spring. I am telling ya, it is so accurate and powerful that i still amaze myself when i fire it now even after 10 years. \n\nWebley fx 2000 is a pre charged like my Rapid7. Webley make some VERY good airguns but when it comes to pre-charged pneumatics, there are only two names IF you dont want to compromise. Theoben Rapid, and the second one is Daystate Air Wolf which came out a long after the Theoben. I have never fired an Air Wolf, but from what I hear and read on reviews, it is same, or in some sense better than Theoben, but that could be a debate in itself.\n \nSo if money is not an object, and pre-charged pneumatics is what you want, then please only consider these two names. New Theoben set-up including a divers air bottle etc will cost you about £1200. Although you can pick up a used one in good condition for under £700 easily and under £600 if you look hard enough.\n\nThere is a lot more info on your questions, but hope you have enough to go on for now.  Do a google on these names to see what magnificiant guns they are, and feel free to ask more brother.', 0, 1, '86.8.7.252', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1874, 46630),

About 4000 trees were grafts on existing Kahoo trees and 6000 pure Olive plants are in different stages of plantation. We get many visitors from Government officials and otherwise wanting to study the plantation specially after a detailed study conducted a few years back came to the conclusion that this is not viable in Soon Valley. We planted everything they said that could not be successful and more and all of it without water which we countered with drip irrigation. There are about 1000 peach trees as well as apples and other assorted fruits and vegetables. Staple crops like wheat we only grow without the use of any fertilizer or pesticide for home use, as it is the best kind of organic ''aata'' there is, everything else tastes like flour compared to it. We estimate that by 2011 the plantation should start to give it''s optimum output and if InshAllah all goes well the plantation should be able to supply 10 % of Pakistan''s Olive Oil needs.\n\nI''m glad the attending members enjoyed the trip.

I dont remember the price.. but it was 165 or 185ks.. but the dollar was for 61 then.. now its 83.. so do the math..\n\nThe M1Super90 was I think a joint venture between HK and Benelli.. It was what put the O in offensive combat shotguns.. I have heard lots of good stuff.. thats the one I started out to buy. But the M4 is an improved version and newer so I guess that sold me out.. \n\nHowever.. It is a bit dated.. and the M4S90(with Fixed stock/pistol grip and 5 shot)/ M1014 (with ret stock, pistol grip and 9 shot) is the successor to the legendary M1..\n\nThe gas piston is more or less the same as considering AK47.. so its a plus.. and will not foul up even after extended shooting.. \n\nIf you want a inertia driven one I would HIGHLY recommend the M2 SUper 90.. It is so lightweight and well balanced all rounder.. for home defense and you can take it hunting and skeet shooting even.. (but be advised use good ammo in lighter loads)..\n\nI am also unsure as to the availability of the M1 over here.. but if you want to collect it as a classic.. sure why not!

I heard a couple of years ago once the govt also banned these rifles, and asked every one to voluntarily give it in to the police stations etc. "coincidently" they then decided to finish the ban (when they thought now they have all or majority of them) and so the people who didnt hand them in, could keep theirs....quite cunning I say :)\nAnyway, so I think they could be good, but crossman is no match for Webley (webley Vulcan for example). The rabbit stopper is a good gun, but believe me, Webley vulcan or eclipse is far superior. \nYes you ask a very interesting question. Yes there are very good and affordable springers around. To me, the top one I have tried and absolutely love it after 10 years of having it, is a Webley Vulcan (Mark II if you can get one). It is full legal power at 12ft/lb and is VERY accurate gun, even without the telescopic sights. I bough mine for only £150 and it was in IMMACULATE condition without even a scratch although now it looks pretty different after being used for so many years in Deepalpur / Dipalpur :)\n\nIf you look patiently and hard enough there are plenty of good examples of these guns about and surely you will find one. Have a look online on different UK hunting forums and they all have a for sale section usually. Also look online, in online free ads papers etc. They go for anything from £40 to £150. A friend of mine bough one in quite bad condition for only £20 which is a steal really. He spent some time and effort on it, and last weekend I tried it out and it shoots like a dream. absolutely spot on the target.\n\nAir guns are a little bit like cars. Both need good metal. Good workmanship. Precision and care. Following is a very rough comparison: Cheapest ones are Chinese (e.g QingQi cars and Chinese air guns).... better ones are American (e.g Chrysler, GM and Crossman).... better ones are German (BMW, Mercs, VW and in guns Weihrauch ), but then the top hand made stuff WAS Traditional British (e.g Rolls Royce, TVR griffith and "Webley and Scott", Theoben, Diana, etc)\n\nThe above comparison is in no way accurate, just a very rough comparison of how the steel and workmanship has shaped the manufacturing quality around the world. Mind you, I would also like to add that now the Chinese are manufacturing excellent quality stuff too, and the Brits are losing most of the industry because they simply can not afford to pay their workers enough to fulfil basic needs such as house, family health, schools, and food. And now most of the British names I mentioned above no longer make guns in Britain and for sure due to this reason, the new Webleys are lower quality and precision when compared to the older models that were made entirely within the UK.\n\nSo if you can find a good example of Webley Vulcan in .22 (preferably Mark II) then I am sure you will never want to sell it again. You may sell it to upgrade to a more expensive gun, but trust me you will still not want to :)\n\nDo you know how much land does your friend have altogether?', 0, 1, '86.8.7.252', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1874, 47137),

(41167, 1420, 0, 'Ata', 554, '', 1249476885, 'A. A lot of shooters have wondered what happens when a bullet is fired vertically. Popular lore includes such mis-ideas as the bullet burns up falling back down, it comes down at the same velocity as its original muzzle velocity, and probably one that says it disappears in a time warp.\n\nThe two best references on the subject are "Hatcher''s Notebook", (by Julian S. Hatcher, 3rd edition, June 1962, Stackpole Books, ISBN: 0811707954) which includes a chapter on bullets fired vertically, and an article titled "Terminal Velocity and Penetration Studies," by Lucien C. Haag, which appeared in Vol 2, No. 1 of Wound Ballistics Review. This information is excerpted from both.\n\nFirst, it must be understood that recovering vertically fired bullets is difficult because wind causes them to drift from the expected vertical line. (This probably accounts for many of the myths.) \n\nHatcher''s tests indicated that on the average, vertically fired rifle bullets reach about 9000 feet in altitude (slowed from their muzzle velocity by air drag and gravity to zero velocity), taking about 20 seconds to reach maximum height. Then, pulled by gravity, and slowed by air drag they take about 40 or so seconds to return. Bullets fired vertically come back base first. Why? Read on!\n\nHatcher describes one experiment with the 150gr M2 Ball bullet fired vertically. When it came back from vertical (round trip time was about 42.9 seconds) it left only a 1/16 inch dent in a soft pine board that it happened to hit. (Not exactly what it would do at 2700f/s, eh?) Based upon this and similar tests Hatcher concluded that the impact velocity was about 300 f/s, which from additional testing appears to be the terminal velocity (the maximum free fall velocity which is limited by air drag on the body in question) of that bullet falling from any height in the atmosphere. (If I remember correctly from my limited parachuting experience the terminal velocity of a falling person is somewhere around 130 mph or about 200 f/s.) \n\nWhat does not substantially change, even at extreme range, is the rotational speed of the bullet that was imparted by the rifling (around 300k rpm) since the effect of air drag on the rotational velocity in negligible. Thus the gyroscopic action, once the projectile is stabilized, tends to keep the bullet oriented in the same direction, thus the base first (well ok, original position trailing end) return. It is interesting that this was not commonly known until just before WWII. The British had lots of dud antiaircraft rounds that all came back base down, or more correctly oriented to the same elevation as shot from the gun. BTW, this is what raises hob with traditional long range small arms ballistics. With lots of elevation on the bore (past 2,000+ or so yards) at the far end the bullet is actually falling sideways and all frontal air drag algorithms are out the window.\n\nInterestingly, Hatcher describes an experiment that shows the gyroscopic stability at work. They loaded the 150gr M2 flat based bullet backwards and found that the round trip time was a bit shorter (about 30.4 seconds) due to the bullet being "streamlined (point down) on the return trip. The drag on the upward trip was not as greatly effected due to the high muzzle velocity. No estimated impact velocity was given but it would have been somewhat higher due to the lower air drag on the bullet since it was coming down point first.\n\nThe Haag article used a ballistics computation program to calculate vertically fired bullet performance and came up with results comparable with Hatcher''s work. Using bullets ranging from the .22 rim fire to the 180gr .30 caliber spitzer in the .30-06 the time of flight (up & back) ranged from a low of 25 seconds for the .25ACP to a long of 77 seconds for the M193 ball. Maximum altitudes ranged from a low of 2288 feet for the .25ACP to a high of 10,103 feet for the 180gr .30-06. Terminal velocities ranged from 134 f/s for a tumbling .22 Short to a high of 323 f/s for the 180gr .30-06.\n\nHaag calculated the performance of the .30cal 150gr M2 ball round fired by Hatcher as a maximum altitude of 9330 feet and a round trip time of 57 seconds which is, for all intents and purposes, the same as Hatcher''s observations.\n\nAs a point of interest a velocity of about between 160 and 200 f/s (±) is needed to penetrate skin. However, one could still be seriously injured if struck by a falling bullet.', 0, 1, '124.29.242.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1915, 47589),

In semi-automatic mode a gas piston drives a bolt carrier and rotating bolt. In pump-action mode the same components are driven by sliding the fore-end backwards. Pump-action mode is required to reliably fire low-pressure (less lethal) ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. Switching between firing modes is done by pressing a button above the foregrip, and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the SPAS-15 is fed by a detachable box magazine. The gun features a folding stock and a pistol grip safety.\n\nThe SPAS-15 is currently used by various law enforcement and military agencies, including some units of Italian army and the Carabinieri, although several Italian special forces units have dismissed it after adoption as its bulk and excessive weight, mostly due to the detachable box magazine, compromised maneuverability in critical situations. It still remains legal to purchase and possess by civilians in Italy as any other smoothbore long arm (shotgun), but having Franchi ceased production of the SPAS-15 around the year 2005, the firearm is getting extremely rare to trace. In 1996, the United States banned the importation of the SPAS-15, although it can still be legally owned and sold. In Canada, the SPAS-15 is classified as a Prohibited Weapon and cannot be legally owned or imported except under very limited circumstances."\n\nNow from the above provided information you can clearly see that its not something that you should spend 235K for. I found an interesting review by a user which is as follows;\n\n"The Long Wait finally ended on Tuesday.  My local dealer phoned to say my SPAS 15 had arrived.  He sounded very excited on the phone and told me he''d never seen anything like it !!   Having waited 7 months 7 days, I could wait no longer, and I immediately booked the rest of the week off on holiday!  I went straight home to pick up the gun, my first impression on opening the box was WOW!  It looks awesome !  I was pleasantly surprised to find the gun lighter than I had expected, and narrower.  I got two magazines with the gun, and the total cost was 900 UK pounds (approx. 1500 US Dollars). \n\nWednesday was my first day of fun with the SPAS 15, I loaded up with Winchester Super X Slugs, CBC Slugs, Express 00 buckshot, and some Gamebore 12 ball 36 gram buckshot.  The SPAS 15 ate it all without a hitch.  Recoil when fired from the shoulder was low, and the gun was very controllable.  Having exhausted my ammo supply I toddled off back home to get some more ammo - this time I loaded up with 28 gram #9 target cartridges.  The SPAS was very well behaved when fired single handed (and using the shoulder sling of course) and the muzzle stayed on target.  There was only one misfeed with a #9 target load and that was when fired from the hip, supported by both hands but not touching my body. \n\nSo far I''ve tried over 200 cartridges through the gun, and I''m VERY happy  it!   I had loads of fun on Saturday when I was shooting a a metal plate at distances of 80-100 yards.  Now I have to stock up on ammo as I didn''t realise how hungry this gun would be! \n\nCleaning the gun was a bit fiddly, everything inside the barrel shroud had a light coating of oil which collected the burnt powder.  I removed the stock, but I couldn''t manage to get the bolt and bolt carrier out of the receiver, but I know they should come out! \n\nI will try to take some photos over the Christmas holidays, and will email them sometime in January. \n\nTo summarise, the SPAS 15 is awesome.  I was impressed by the looks, feel, quality and performance of the gun.  I love it!"\n\nNow this is something which came from my knowledge but as you mentioned that you want Epert Panel opinion, i dont think it will matter much.', 0, 1, '119.152.22.71', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 1909, 47765),

There are many factors like bore and chamber dimensions, barrel cylinder gap the dimensions of the forcing cone the smoothness of the barrel etc. Which have to be taken into account.\n\nIf you were to take a revolver or a pistol with  an 8 inch barrel and you kept cutting two inches and chronographing with the same ammo , with every loss of barrel length the velocity will go down as all factors are the same\n\nNow if you take two pistols /revolvers of the same make with different barrel lengths and you chronograph them with same ammo there are chances you will be in for a surprise.

Muzzle velocity per se is not the only determinant of trajectory, down range velocity and retained energy, and for that, you must factor in projectile mass, ballistic co-efficient and sectional density, at the very least.

The ammo I was using was Eley Club which is basically the bread and butter round for shooters. Lately it''s been unavailable or it''s prices have gotten a little out of hand. I wanted to test the cheapest .22 LR ammo I could find on the market which was the Armscor .22 LR (Rs. 11/bullet). Also some Winchester HP''s (Rs. 18/bullet) had been lying around for a while and I wanted see what results I could get from it. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]4723[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]4725[/ATTACH]\n\nTested the Armscor first.

This is just like spinning a top, you rotate it fast and disturb it, it will come back to its orignal spinning position. If you rotate is a bit slow it will come back after taking some more time. This is why when rotated faster with longer barrels, bullets tend to overcome factors like cross wind and travelling through air with different densities.
