(52805, ' I went to the range which sponsor''s me as a shooter wearing the team jersey.  I was immediate approached by a man who was having problems with his AMT chambered in .22 magnum.  I could not get it to function reliably.  But I narrowed the problem down to a severly beat up hammer. \n\nGun 1: AMT .22 AutoMag\n[img]http://guns4u.info/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/automag_3.jpg[/img]\nThis particular AMT was all beat up and mistreated and needed lots or repairs.  \n\nAfter I shot a bit I ran the range (I am a part time employee and I fill in as Range Officer when there and needed)\n\nA couple new to shooting showed up with new Glock G19s.  She was very new and needed to be talked through loading, grip, sight picture and allignment, and trigger control.  Part of instructing her I demonstrated that most guns all more accurate than the shooter, myself included.  I asked to use 3 rounds of her 9mm ammo.  She consented and I fired 3 into the bulleye all touching.  Now she has confidence that the gun shoots very well, I know what I am talking about and should listen to my instruction.\n\nGun 2: Glock 19 9mm\n[img]http://www.ssgtactical.com/glock19p.jpg[/img]\nI owned a Glock 19 for awhile and really enjoyed shooting it.  I regret selling it.  I enjoyed shooting one again.\n\nA little further down was a man who about 60 with two much younger men, one I presumed to be his grandson.  He was looking a bit nervous and the grandson was giving him some grief because he was outshooting the elder.  Well, I wasn''t having none of that.  Youngsters got to respect their elders.  So I counselled the elder man a bit and demonstrated the Springfield XD chambered in .45 was a very good gun.\n\nGun 3: Springfield XD 45\n[img]http://www.christiangunowner.com/images/xd45compside.jpg[/img]\nI''ve always enjoyed the Springfield feel but not the long trigger.  I shot well and the grip safety on essentially a Glock design with the loaded chamber indicator and cocked striker indicators are brilliant.\n\nThe two younger men were shooting a Smith & Wesson model 910 and a Ruger SR9.  I chatted with them since I carried a related model S&W on the Sheriff''s department and demonstrated the magazine disconnect on the S&W.  \n\nThe Ruger is becoming popular in Production division of USPSA/IPSC.  I traded shots out of my Kimber for shots out of the S&W 910 and Ruger SR9, both 9mm.\n\nGun 4: S&W model 910\n[img]http://www.gunshopfinder.com/smithandwesson/model910.jpg[/img]\nThe S&W was just as I remembered with a long trigger and odd grip angle.\n\nGun 5: Suger SR 9mm\n[img]http://world.guns.ru/handguns/ruger_sr9_1.jpg[/img]\nI think Ruger has a winner with the SR9.  It was accurate and has a nice trigger.\n\nDown to the other end was a man shooting a Glock 22 in .40 S&W.  He was shooting better than most but was high and to the left.  I talked with him about the chance he was pushing with the heel of his hand a bit in anticipation of the shot.  He picked a new place to aim and printed a 4" group but not as high or left.  I also coached him on trigger control and his next set of shots were almost touching. \n\nGun 6: Glock 22 in .40 S&W.\n[img]http://kevinkurz.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/glock-22.jpg[/img]\nThe Glock 22 and 23 are one of the most popular guns in American law enforcement.  The Bexar County Sheriff''s Department, the San Antonio Police Department, the Constable''s Office and School Police in San Antonio all carry Glock 22 or 23.  They are a nice gun with a chambered for a nice round.\n\nI also chatted with a man shooting a revolver he carried in a wooden box.  One imagines that a gun transported in a wooden box in the U.S. is probably somebody''s baby, a prized possession.\n\nIt was a Smith and Wesson revolver chambered in .357 magnum.  I was crome with gold toned hammer and trigger with Ivory grips.  Very fancy.  The owner offered to let me shoot it... who was I to turn him down? :lol:\n\nGun 7: Smith & Wesson (didn''t get a chance to read the model, looked like a 27)\n[img]http://bushnell.smugmug.com/photos/177717576-L.jpg[/img]\nThe owner reported th gun was carried by his father when he was a Bexar County Deputy Sheriff.  I''v enever really enjoyed shooting a revolver.  But I respect that the owner let me shoot his father''s duty gun.\n\nI returned to the range the following day to check some reloads and met a couple shooting. He had a Desert Eagle .50 Automag and she was shooting a Heckler and Kock USP Tactical.  He asked If I had a Kimber which I confirmed.  He complimented my gun and I expressed envy for the H&K she was shooting.  He offered to let me shoot it... :D\n\nI shot it at 15 yard and I was very, very impressed.  I have never shot a n H&K before, and the trigger was nice.  It was very accurate.  Though I expected the recoil to be a bit snappy since the bore axis was high, it really wasn''t bad.  I can say now that those who are H&K fanatics have some justification for their loyalty.\n\nGun 8: H&K USP Tactical in .45 ACP.\n[img]http://www.ssgtactical.com/hkusptacblk.jpg[/img]\n\n\nAnd that''s how you get to shoot 8 different guns in one weekend... well, 9 different guns if you count my Kimber Supermatch II. :cool:\n[img]http://www.gunshopfinder.com/Kimber/supermatch2.jpg[/img]', ''),

(52873, ' Dr. Sahib even though i''ve never seen the two pistols (let alone using them) but here is my take on this:\n\nboth are clones of a very famous design, the difference is one clone (CZ) is the standard sidearm of Yogoslavian/Serbian military whereas china opted to come up with an indeginously design pistol CF98 for its military instead of NP34. I think with this analogy one can come to a conclusion that CZ999 is a far better weapon.\n\nsecond: all tests on the CZ were conducted in the US, it passed all sand/snow/water/mud type tests before being put into mass production. if fullfilled all the requirements of a police/military type weapon. infact 51 U.S. law enforcement departments have expressed interest in obtaining them. infact, Isreal and South Africa both have purchased licenses from Crvena Zastava, allowing them access to tooling and plans to manufacture CZ. what does that tell ya?\n\nthird: if NP34 was that good, how come not even a single military in the whole world chose to adopt them. infact the very makers (china) of NP34 went for CF98 when they needed a reliable/accurate weapon for their military.\n\nfrom where i''m sitting, I dont think one can compare NP34 and CZ999. in my opinion one is designed to function (CZ) whereas other (NP34) is designed to mimick the looks.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I don’t like and will never do Insha Allah  any act or post against any one, my aim is benefits for all hunters but never loss for any one.\n\n[u][b]PROCEEDURE TO MAKE DECOYS OF ANY KIND GAME SPECIE[/b][/u]\n1.	Scan or download & save the pictures of your required species in different poses at high resolution Minimum with 400.dpi. \n2.	Draw a canvas at Adobe Photoshop for the size of 4x4 feet. (divide it into pixels or in inches if you required), with minimum 200.dpi resolution. \n3.	 Drag your already scanned picture at this canvas; crop the additional base colour scheme.\n4.	Repeat this practice for your each scanned picture at the same canvas; adjust the pictures closely to each other. (Remember you need to be a reflected pose for the same picture at the same canvas, means left and right pose directions).\n5.	Save it as PSD File on CD/USB.\n6.	Visit to your nearest Pena Flex  printer, and ask for  the 4x4 print size. (Price should be from 20 to 35 rupees per square foot) REMEMBER: ask for 600.dpi print output.\n7.	Cut the each printed bird shape with scissor; make a pair of each print of the same species (with left & right directional poses).\n8.	Buy  few thermo poll  sheets (Thickness one inch)\n9.	Paste your one printed pose at reasonable space on the thermo pole sheet; practice this method for all your prints at same side of the sheet.\n10.	Take sharp edge long blade of steel or any kitchen knife, warm it on fire flam and carefully cut to the thermo pole sheet with the border line of the pasted species prints.\n11.	Now, your decoy’s one side is ready, paste another print of the same species at other side of the sheet.\n12.	According to number of decoys sheets, take slides of flat Iron bars length up to 6-inches for each, warm to each slid and insert it into the thermo pole sheet at the point of bird foot print. (It will work as decoy stand; you can push it into ground for display of decoys).\n\n[u][b]NOTE[/b][/u]\n•	You can take size of the required adult bird from any URL, when you are going to drag the picture at canvas, you can adjust your required size as you found (birds size should be in centimetres) \n•	If you don’t know, how to adjust the sizes or unaware about Adobe Photoshop;than you can take help of the designers of Pena flex  printers or photographer’s.  They will charge 200 t0 300 for each sheet of 4x4 size of canvas.\n•	Samad Bond is good pasting material for this job. Don’t use Elfy or any chemical like Ely.\n•	Iron slid you can fix in the thermo pole sheet with glue or with Samad Band Also. (after making hole with warm slide)\n•	The decoys made by this method, are 100% near to the original colours and in original size of the bird. These are the best decoys,\nthan the local made decoys are available at shops like Dracula Decoys of ducks. \n\nThis method of decoys making is very good for URIAL,IBEX, HOG DEER, WILD BOAR trophy hunting also, but the technich to display for the concerning hunt is different, which I will mention soon in my next posts.\n\nTry the best decoys and enjoy the current duck shooting season.\n\nRegards.\n\nSyed Ali Farzoq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', ''),

I have one with wooden stock (O/U) and I,m using it since last 10 years. It is giving me perfect service. Baikal with wooden stock are a bit on the heavier side in weight. Although it has advantage in terms of relatively less recoil as compared to lighter guns but carrying it all the day in Pothohar broken grounds climbing small hillocks up and down becomes taxing. Similarly Turkish shot guns are also worth their price, however, they do not have much resale value. Coincidently I have a Turkish 12 Gauge O/U with one trigger and five chokes with wooden stock. I have not used it much but its very much OK with me (although I am addicted to my Baikal).\n   Now as far as the used one are concerned it all depends on their condition or how have they been used.

(52989, ' My Dear Syed Ali Farzoq Sahib! I do not know why you initiated this mail and in response to what but I beg to differ with you on a couple of issues. While one may have lot of practical as well as theoretical experience, the importance of further knowledge can not be over emphasized. I have been a hunter since my young age. I inherited it from my father who also had it in his genes. But having said that and having hunted for more than 30 years in various capacities from dove to Ibex and antelopes in Africa (Congo) I still learnt a lot from internet and let me say very openly I learnt a lot from this very forum. From the young lads like KageFox who is younger to my eldest child to the very senior members like Skeeter60 whom I have known personally since decades. And from the newest member to the oldest member like Abbas Sahib, whom I respect a lot. I have learnt a lot. This all has been made possible because of net and surfing. So the net has a sound place in learning.\n\n      Buying a jeep and a gun and going hunting..........I do not see anything wrong in it :) . Unless one shoots indiscriminately and illegally, which I do not think is the case with most of us or for that matter with any of us \n\n     And lastly as far as hunting ethics are concerned, one learns and develops them over a period of time. I have not come across a book like "Highway Code" on this issue. One would commit mistake and would then be corrected by the senior hunter or if he is accompanied by a senior hunter he will not commit a mistake right from beginning. But people learn over a period of time. Few are more privileged in the sense that they have it in their families and they learn from their childhood while the remaining learn over a time span. I also learnt them over a period of time. Now having said that, I know, still many shoot varmints with lights and use autos, but that is the way they do. I think my prerogative ends here. I should not say whether it is right or wrong unless it is a law and I am informing people about it.\n\n     I believe sounding an opinion is OK but enforcing that and ensuring other follow ones own opinion is not right. Pardon me if I say that your mail sounded to me more like projecting your self as Mr Know All while others do not know anything. I have always honored your opinion and tips as I grade you a better professional hunter than me and I respect you a lot. I request you not to overstep please. In the process of raising my concern if, inadvertantly, I have hurt your feelings or anybody,s feeling I apologize right now  :)', ''),

Permits are very difficult to get and trophy hunting of Urial and Ibex is done mostly by foreigners after paying huge fees\n- If someone puts up snaps of big game in Pakistan it should be mandatory to mention permit details.\n\n\nI would appreciate discussion and input regarding this from all members.', ''),

(53224, ' With our interest in firearms I think it''s also imperative that we also focus a little on the ammunition and terminology used. The term "Muzzle Energy" often comes up, quite simply it means:\n\nMuzzle energy is the kinetic energy of a bullet as it is expelled from the barrel (muzzle) of a firearm. It is often used as a rough measurement of the destructive potential of a given firearm or load. The heavier the bullet and the faster it moves, the higher its muzzle energy and the more damage it will do. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Muzzle1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Muzzle2.jpg[/img]\n\n"It must be stressed that muzzle energy is dependent upon the factors previously listed and that even velocity is highly variable depending upon the length of the barrel a projectile is fired from. While the above list mentions some averages, there is wide variation in commercial ammunition. A 180 grain bullet fired from .357 magnum handgun can achieve a muzzle energy of 580 foot-pounds. A 110 grain bullet fired from the same gun might only achieve 400 foot-pounds of muzzle energy, depending upon the manufacture of the cartridge. Some .45 Colt ammunition can produce 1200 foot-pounds of muzzle energy, far in excess of the average listed above."\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)', ''),

(53231, ' Now another opinion as to why Spanish Shotguns are not famous or have not made their place in elite shotguns of the world and about the increasing price of Spanish Shotguns. The manufacturers to which I am referring are Aguirre y Aranzabal (AyA), Arrieta y Cia, Pedro Arrizabalaga, Armas Garbi, and Grulla Armas. None of these are major arms producers and none have a particularly long history in their present form. As already highlighted by a member that they are all small specialty shops with few employees (maybe a dozen on average) that make mostly bespoke shotguns essentially by hand. Grulla, for example, is 19 craftsmen that produce around 300 guns per year (Says Chuck Hawks). Theses are not the only shotgun makers in Spain, but they are the firms that turned the reputation of Spanish shotguns completely around. In post WW II days Spanish guns were regarded with suspicion. And that is because in the 1950''s there was a niche market in the United States for cheap double guns. The mass market in those days was for repeating shotguns and what market there was for middle and high priced double guns was already overcrowded by American, British, Belgian, and Italian guns. The Spanish economy was still struggling to recover from the debilitating Spanish Civil War that preceded W.W. II.\n\nHowever, there was room at the bottom of the price structure and American distributors paid the large Spanish makers that existed in those days to produce economy doubles. The Spanish gun companies desperately needed cash flow and were in no position to turn down orders, so cheap guns is what they built. Unfortunately for the Spanish makers who mass-produced inexpensive shotguns, the manufacturers in South America, Eastern Europe and Turkey were able to undercut their prices, as the years went by.  Eventually the market for double guns turned around, quality became more important than price, and the large Basque gunmakers who had disastrously misjudged the market by committing to inexpensive guns went under. The few surviving tiny specialty shops began their ascent to international respectability. They tightened their lines, dropped their lower grade guns and concentrated on building fine side-by-side shotguns. That is how the price of Spanish Shotguns started increasing. There have also been a tendency in Spanish Shotgun manufacturers to copy the classic British side-by-side game gun as that had been the ultimate expression of the gunmakers'' art. It took years of hard work since the 1950''s and today Spain is a prosperous country. With increased prosperity has come higher labor costs and higher prices and so the price of guns. With this there came a change in strategy of manufacturer as well. The AYA says "As far as sales are going at the moment, we are chasing supply rather than demand, which is a good situation to be in. AYA and the other Spanish makers realised the only way to compete in the British market was to use the very finest materials. The British shooter demands a gun that will outlive him, as opposed to a car or washing machine that he accepts will eventually break down. Integrity is very important in the British gun market and AYA has made that part of its philosophy." \n \nAN AYA gun''s engraving \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/9717/64623009.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

I will just put another piece of the jigsaw puzzle on board. \nA bullet that has higher BC(ballistic coeffecient) will better retain the muzzle energy down the range. Like, if we fire two bullets having same muzzle energy but different BC, the bullet having higher BC value will retain more hitting power down the range and will hit hard.\n\nP.S: A bullet that has higher sectional density and better aerodynamic shape(spitzer, boat tail) lesser air drag will have higher BC value.', ''),
(53241, ' thank you so much for the info...', ''),
(53243, ' Simple answer to your question would be YES! and NO!\n\nBarrel length upto an (optimum) extent will increase the range of the projectile because it will take longer for the bullet to travel the length of the barrel and in that time the full propellent will be burned, the longer the bullet remains in the barrel the higher the pressure builds, which increases the velocity and range of the bullet. Accuracy improves because of longer sight radius.\n\nConversely if the barrel is too long the the bullet will take even longer to travel down the length of the barrel, subjected to more friction which would slow down the bullet, the bolt may start to recycle before the bullet is out of the barrel thus releasing the pressure inside the barrel and further deteriorating the velocity and range of the bullet.\n\nAgin it is not as simple as it may sound, besides the length of the barrel the rifiling twist also plays major role in the velocity, stability, and range of the bullet. there are a lot of other factors involved too, but mentioning them would complicate the things.\n\nSimply a bullet fired from a 5"barrel would have longer range than the same bullet fired from a 4" barrel, which would have longer range than the same bullet fired from 3"barrel\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[quote=TT-33]Dear Friends, Can some body tell me How the Barell Lenth effcets fire range of a Gun, either it depends only on the ammo?[/quote]', ''),

(53247, ' Here are two links to calculate the muzzle energy of any particular weapon\n\n[url]http://www.airhog.com/convert.htm[/url]\n\n[url]http://billstclair.com/energy.html[/url]\n\nAnd Oooooops! Mike Hudson has a totally different view. Which says \n\n"While energy calculations may be of value when comparing various loads in a single caliber or similar calibers, they can be worse than useless when comparing different calibers and different hunting situations. To illustrate the point, let''s examine a couple of rounds, one being a wildly popular high velocity round in wide use today and the other being an outmoded and forgotten dinosaur.\n\nThe .243 Winchester fires a 95 gr. spitzer bullet at 3100 fps in one popular hunting load, producing 2021 ft. lbs (The reader may like to calculate the result using the first site mentioned by me. The calculation is by and large correct for both the rifles) of muzzle energy in the process. Many thousands of hunters arm themselves with .243 rifles and kill an inordinate number of deer and antelope every year. (Thereby demonstrating its effectiveness for such use. The .243 is also quite popular in Africa for hunting game animals of similar size. -Ed.)\n\nOn paper, the .243 also stacks up great against an old cartridge like, say, the .303 Savage, which launches its flat nosed, 190 gr. slug at a MV of 1980 fps and achieves a paltry 1650 ft. lbs. of energy at the muzzle. The informed observer might further note that the old Savage round is obsolete, meaning it isn''t loaded by any of the major ammunition manufacturers anymore, and that rifles chambered for it haven''t been manufactured in many years.\n\nBased on this alone, it would be easy to conclude that the .243 is the far better game getter in most, if not all, hunting applications. As with most easy conclusions, however, this one depends entirely on the application and situation.\n\nA lot of factors may have played a role in the ascent of the .243 and the casting aside of the .303 Savage, but muzzle energy shouldn''t have been one of them. Experience has shown that, at ranges of less than 150 yards where trajectory isn''t much of a factor, a hit from a 190 gr. soft point slug is going to bag a lot of game. At those ranges and on game larger than pronghorn antelope and medium size deer, a well placed shot from the old .303 beats a well placed shot from the .243 every time.\n\nThink about it. While neither caliber would be appropriate for dangerous game, if you found yourself suddenly and uncomfortably up close and personal with a grizzly bear, would you feel better with a .303 or a .243 in your hands?\n\nOut past 200 yards, the .303''s rainbow trajectory comes into play and the less than aerodynamic shape of its bullet compounds the effects of gravity. It is only then that the flat shooting characteristics of the .243 come into play.\n\nSuch comparisons could be made all day, and are not meant to denigrate the many sportsmen around the world who have chosen the .243, or any other caliber, as suitable for their purposes. They are used merely to point out that fallacy of using muzzle energy, or any other purely theoretical consideration, as some kind of be all and end all when it comes to killing power.

A faster bullet will travel further.  This is true until all of the powder/propellent is burned.  If all powder is burned then the resistance of the lands of the rifling inside the barrel will begin to slow the bullet down.  \n\nDo not worry too much about this happening unless you have a very, very long barrel or a very light load, or both.  Most factory cartridges manufactured for a factory caliber gun will not burn up all the powder before the bullet leaves the barrel. \n\nThe flash at the end of the barrel confirms that not all of the powder (propellent) was burned before the bullet left the barrel.\n\n2) A longer barrel allows for a longer sight radius.  The longer sight radius allows for more accurate shooting.  To my knowledge- with all things being equal except the barrel length, longer barrels do not give more accuracy.', ''),

Yes i also hear d a lot about Russian Weapons and soem one from lahore also bought a MP 446 Russian Viking Pistol from lahore in about 60 K And he is more then satisfied with his new baby. I thinkn Viking is also a russian weapon which is currently in use of Russain armed forces.Is here any one from Karachi who helps me in finding this pistol precisely with the price .\n\nFurther, Dr Zakir mentioned Beykal also another option . Kindly do let me know about which model of  beykal precisly you are refering me.

This is the only option I see.\nI will be too pleased along with Mr Shano Shah to help all new and old reloaders to make a list of reloading tools and other essentials\nPropellant for Hand guns is available, and arrangements for Rifle propellants can also be made.\nThe tools  and bullets (projectiles only)any one can easily bring along in checked baggage, or import; the only problem is that of  PRIMERS. These are cheap and can be imported if an order of a 100,000 or more is placed with a dealer. These used to be available with arms dealers till the mid 60s. hand gun bullets can be cast at home which are super accurate and so cheap you will shoot at least ten times more and enjoy yourself.\nGun smoke is healthier than ciggerate smoke', ''),

When ever i go to market i will only refer to either CZ Scorpion or Viking . n will definetly go for the pistol which suits best in my hands. i Think so there is naother difefernec bwteen the CZ & Viking other then the frame material which is i think so Viking has a Pictitionary rail for Laser where as Cz 999 lacks this feature . in Zastava this feature is included in their next model which is CZ 05 but i am not sure whether Cz 05 is availabel here in karachi or not.\n\nOne more thing which i would to enquire about this Viking , either the hammer is external or it is internal like glocks /walthers/ S & W.

(53702, ' Aoa guys,\n\nLast night I was in my village in Narowal. A friend came over from the city to spend the night. We were talking and couldn''t sleep. So at 2:45 a.m , we went out for a lookaround. Had one A-303 shotgun with sg and one Voere .22 lr. I was driving and my friend was in the passenger seat with the flash light. At the northern boundary of our land, my neighbour had planted Sesame. The plants were 2-3 feet high and flowering. My friend was bringing the flashlight around when i saw some golden brown colored animal at a distance. I thought it was a jackal and went for a look. When we reached the spot, the plants were high and we couldn''t see anything. Suddenly some plants moved at 11''o clock. The movement stopped at 2''o clock. We still couldn''t figure out what it was. Then to our utter disbelief we saw wild boars. AND A WHOLE DAAR. Dude, was I excited to see them so very close. I had the .22 which I handed over to my friend and took the shotgun from him. As I was driving so i placed the gun on my left shoulder, aimed and fired. The next thing I heard were frantic screams. In a couple of seconds, while I was trying to figure out as to which one I got, I saw The Mama boar coming at 1''o clock. Boy, was she big. Just a bit shorter than an adult donkey. First, i thought she was going to attack. Adult usually do when fired at. But, probably she was coming to check out on the screaming one. I tried to get an aim but it was difficult as the side view mirror and the windscreen''s frame was in my way. I fired a second shot just by pointing the gun towards her, without taking an aim. I missed and she turned around and ran away. Then, we turned our attention towards the screaming one and to my surprise i got two. TWO IN ONE SHOT. That is a first for me. The screaming one seemed young. He/she got hit in the hind legs and was trying to get up but couldn''t. I looked at the other one (at whom I aimed). He/she was bigger and was down as well, hit above his front leg. It was moving it''s front legs as if running, while lying on it''s side. I fired an sg shot in his head and he stopped moving. Now I handed the shotgun over to my friend and took the .22 . Fired a few rounds at the little fellow and he stopped moving as well. We went around but couldn''t find anything else. We turned around towards the Dera and got a Rabbit on the way. He was still alive when we got home and slaughtered it. We thought we might get lucky again and went to have a look at the dead one''s BUT no one came to eat them. \n\nWhat made this hunting episode so special and prompted me to share it with you guys was the fact that we had a kill within 5-7 min. And it was totally unplanned. Sometimes, on planned hunts with guides, I have had to spend the whole night without finding anything. Such is the nature of hunting.\n\nWell!! I have written an essay!

But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Allah''s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it." And it has also been narrated by ''Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet "If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?" The Prophet replied, "He can eat if he wishes."\n******************************************\n\nnow to answer ur question allow me quote this section of the above hadith\n\n"If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?" The Prophet replied, "He can eat if he wishes."\n\nExplaination (to my understanding):\n\nif the hunter has taken Allah''s Name before launching his arrow towards a game animal but found the animal dead after two or three days, he can eat it provided the cause of death of the animal is determined to be the very arrow shot by the hunter.\n\n[b]A humble request:[/b]\n\n[b]please dont take my word for it. take this Hadith to a qualified person and have him explain its meaning to you.[/b]\n\n\n\nRegards.[/quote]', ''),

(53836, ' [u][b]Dakota Fire Hole[/b][/u]\n\nA little known survival aid related to wilderness fire making skills is the Dakota Fire Hole, also known as the Dakota Fire Pit. This handy device is easy to construct and has marked advantages over other types of camp fire constructs. Once you make a Dakota fire hole and try it out, you may choose to use this method on a regular basis.\nMaking a Dakota Fire Hole is initially more labor intensive than simply building a fire on the surface of the ground. However the outlay in energy required to make a Dakota fire hole is more than offset by its efficient consumption of fuel; it greatly reduces the amount of firewood required to cook meals, treat water to destroy pathogens, or warm your body.\nThe Dakota fire hole is a valuable wilderness survival aid because it burns fuel more efficiently, producing hotter fires with less wood. In many areas firewood is scarce or requires a large amount of time and expenditure of energy in foraging to obtain it. Once you build a fire, efforts are better spent attending to your other wilderness survival needs rather than in the constant gathering of firewood \nOther advantages of the Dakota fire hole are that it creates a kind of woodstove with a stable platform that is very convenient to cook over.\nShould you need to conceal your fire, the fire hole will limit the amount of visible smoke that rises from the fire, since the fuel wood is burning hotter and more efficiently. The pit will also help conceal the light emitted from your fire, especially at night when even a single candle flame can be seen from miles away.\n[u][b]Where to Build a Dakota Fire Hole[/b][/u]\nBefore you start to dig your Dakota fire hole you should scout out an area where soil conditions are conducive to its proper construction. You will want to avoid areas\n•	that are rocky and difficult to dig. \n•	with thick tree roots that require cutting. \n•	that are wet or where a dug hole will fill with water. \n•	With soil conditions such as dry loose sand that will not hold shape as it is dug into.\n•	The usual requirements related to general fire craft and care always apply. As always, treat the wilderness areas you enjoy and count on to survive with respect. Be sure you do not make a Dakota Fire Hole in conditions where out of control wild fires are a possibility and avoid ecologically sensitive areas. Try not to injure the roots of trees and plants.\n•	Follow local ordinances regarding the making of fires; these rules are in place for good reason\n\n[u][b]Making a Dakota Fire Hole[/b][/u]\nNow that we have the introduction taken care of, we can make a Dakota Fire Hole. As shown in the picture, I am using an army folding shovel to dig with. Many wilderness survivors carry a small hand trowel for the burying of human wastes and this also works well. A strong stick or part from your mess kit can also be utilized for digging holes in a pinch; survival experts are experts at innovation so use whatever means you have available.\n[u][b]Making the Fire Pit Chamber[/b][/u]\nHaving selected a likely area in which to dig the fire hole, first remove a plug of soil and plant roots in the form of a circle about 10 or 12 inches in diameter. Continue digging straight down to a depth of about one-foot being sure to save the plug and the soil you removed for replacement later on.\n\nThis part of the Dakota fire hole will serve as the main chamber that contains the fire. I prefer to extend the base of the fire chamber outward a couple of inches in all directions so that it can accommodate longer pieces of firewood. This saves time and energy in breaking up firewood into suitable lengths, and also has the effect of allowing larger and therefore hotter fires.\nThe effect is a jug-shaped hole at the base of which you place firewood. The neck of the jug will serve as a chimney of sorts the function of which is to increase the draft and concentrate the heat of the fire into the small opening.\n[u][b]Making the Fire Hole Airway[/b][/u]\nNow comes the key component of the Dakota hole that makes this fire making method so effective; the airway.\nBefore you start on the airway tunnel, determine the general direction of the wind. If the wind is too light to easily ascertain its direction you can often lick a finger and hold it up, being sure it is away from any obstructions. Evaporative cooling on one side or the other of your appendage will be felt from which direction the wind, however light, is blowing. That is the side of the fire hole on which to construct the airway.\nDig a 6-inch diameter airway tunnel starting about one foot away from the edge of the fire hole. Angle its construction so that the tunnel intersects with the base of the fire chamber as shown in the diagram and picture. As when you made the fire hole section, be sure to save the plug containing the vegetation and roots as well as the loose soil you remove.\n[u][b]Using the Dakota Fire Hole[/b][/u]\nNow that the Dakota Fire Hole is properly constructed, you can partially fill the fire pit chamber with dry combustible kindling materials and light the fire.\nTo start the fire I am using a FireSteel, the kind Survival Topics highly recommends to be included in every survival kit. These firesteels from FireSteel.com work even when wet and will literally light thousands of fires before wearing out – try doing that with matches or a lighter! We sell high quality Firesteels at the lowest prices in the Survival Supplies section of this website. Help support this website and buy them here - I guarantee a quality product.\nOnce the flame is going strong, drop it into the fire pit so that it catches the kindling on fire; gradually add sticks so that a strong hot fire is maintained.\n[u][b]How a Dakota Fire Hole Works[/b][/u]\nThe accompanying diagram shows the secret of what makes the Dakota Firehole so effective. As the fire burns, the hot air that is created goes up through the fire hole “chimney”. This creates a suction action that forcefully draws air down through the tunnel and into the base of the fire. The draft is increased even more by your having constructed the tunnel on the side from which the prevailing wind is coming.\nActing as a kind of bellows, the flames are continuously fanned and the fire burns hotter and more efficiently than a fire that is simply made on the surface to the ground. Hotter fires mean less smoke. In addition, the heat of the fire is concentrated into an upward direction where you can better capture it for use. This allows you to do more with less wood – an excellent survival fire by any measure.\n[u][b]Fire Hole Improvements[/b][/u]\nOnce you have made the Dakota fire hole you can easily set up a cooking surface for pots and pans by laying several parallel green sticks across the fire pit as show in the picture. Lacking camp cooking gear you can also find a flat rock that only partially covers the hole – and use it as a sort of hobo frying pan.\n[u][b]Campfire Cleanup[/b][/u]\nWhen it is time to leave the area, be a responsible wilderness survivor who values the land you need for survival. Fill in the Dakota fire hole with the dirt you removed and saved when you were constructing it. Then replace the cap of vegetation. Doing so serves the double purpose of extinguishing the fire and leaving as little trace of your visit as possible.\nIn summary, the main advantages of using a Dakota Fire Hole include:\n•	burns hotter \n•	with less fuel \n•	producing less smoke \n•	less light visible to those you do not want to find you \n•	providing a stable cooking surface \n•	easy extinguishing of the fire \n•	and removal of evidence you have been there when you are preparing to leave.\nThere can be no doubt, making the Dakota Fire Hole one of the best types of survival fires you can make when surviving in the wilderness.\n\nWill post the pics soon,as the Image Posting software is not working right now.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/9633/75987733.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/1810/12269177.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6929/64865163.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/6261/97043809.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

The only place left was with Imran Bhai (Imran Khan), as no one wanted to sit with him. All were scared of him. I had to sit with him, and was so scared cuz i had played one match and scored only 4 runs. I thought I was going to get a scolding. Imran Bhai turned me and said. "Yar! Woh jo tum nay chokay kay liyay pull kiya tha, bahut accha tha". (The way you pulled that bowler for 4 was excellent). \nInzi Bhai said to me, that it was this encouragement that made me the player I am.

But he has got four legs together. Two are forward and two are afterwards. His whole body can be utilized for use. More so the milk. Milk comes from 4 taps attached to his basement. What can it do? Various things like ghee, butter,cream, curd, why and the condensed milk and so forth. Also he is useful to cobbler,gosht karahi,paaey,and mankind generally.\nHis motion is slow only because he is of lazy species.His Gober is much useful to trees, plants as well as for making flat cakes, in hand, and drying in the sun. Cow is the only animal that extricates his feeding after eating. Then afterwards he chew with his teeth whom are situated in the inside of the mouth. He is incessantly in the meadows in the grass. His only attacking and defending organ is the horns, specially so when he is got child. This is done by throwing his head whereby he causes the weapons to be paralleled to the ground of the earth and instantly proceed with great velocity forwards. He has got tails also,situated in the backyard, but not like similar animals. It has hairs on the other end of the other side. This is done to frighten away the flies which alight on his cohesive body hereupon he gives\nhit with it and kills them.The palms of his feet are soft unto the touch. So the grasses head is not crushed. \nAt night time have poses by looking down on the ground\nand sleeps.His eyes and nose are like his other relatives.There are two holes on the two sides of the nose which helps to pass the rope and tie it.The nose is soft and have dew on it.\nSometimes he smiles and other times he is angry.When angry he talks like “Aooooonnnn”and also when his children is lost.\n“This is the cow."', ''),

The Baikal Viking is, as 12Gauge put it, rough and tough, and built like a tank, but I don''t care much for its looks. If you can, wait for more reviews on the Taurus 809, as it has yet to establish itself.

In the previous 9 years I had heard of no accidents, then two in month at the same range (there are 5 in the San Antonio, TX area)\n\nSituation 1:  A man competing in a 3-gun match switched from carbine to handgun.  While drawing the handgun he placed his finger onto the trigger and fired a round through his calf.\n\nSituation 2: A man competing in a USPSA match drew his handgun while moving to the place where he wanted to be to shoot.  He also placed his finger on the trigger and fired a round through his knee.  He had "pinned" the grip safety.  He also had to have thumbed off the thumb safety.\n\nAs with most "problems" with guns, whether it be with inaccuracy or negligent discharges- it''s the jerk on the trigger.\n\nI tell my students that if you tell a gun to go bang, it will try to go bang.  Guns do not go bang by themselves.[/quote]\n\n\nTo me both incidents seem result of AFTER MARKET PERFORMANCE PARTS which competitors use to smoothen their trigger pull etc. And I am sure when changing the parts most of the shooters donot change their previous gun handling habit.[/quote]\n\nI humbly submit that if this where to be true then their previous gun handling habits were wrong.\n\nI understand that they were competitive shooters can distract and lead one to believe it was the "race" equipment, the "shoot faster" guns, but please consider:\n\nPeople too frequently wish to blame the machine or parts instead of the shooter.  These two experienced shooters did what they were not supposed to do:\n\nThey placed their finger on the trigger when they were not ready to shoot.\n\nWhen you place your finger on the trigger you are telling the gun to go bang.\n\nMy Kimber''s trigger has been worked on and requires only 2.5 lbs of pressure to fire it.  I''ve never Negligently Discharged the gun on the draw because I never put my finger on the trigger on the draw.  \n\nIf the two shooters hadn''t placed their finger on the trigger (the bad habit, the unsafe habit) when they weren''t ready to shoot, they wouldn''t have shot when they were unready.  It wouldn''t have mattered if it were a 2.5 lb trigger or 9.5 lb trigger.  No pressure on the trigger is no pressure on the trigger.\n\n\ncaveat: I think pinning the grip safety on a gun is stupid, mechanical malfunctions and poor gun-smithing could produce an accidental discahrge, but that wasn''t the case in the two shootings we had here.', ''),

(54058, ' Springfield Armory XD is a gun originally made in Croatia, under the name of HS2000. Springfield Armory has the license to make this gun.\n\nQSZ-92 is indeed the CF-98, I believe it to be the Chinese military designation.\n\nFN (Fabrique Nationale) is a very famous Belgian gunmaker, which also happens to own Winchester and Browning. The famed Browning Hi-Power GP-35 was made by FN. Many of the light machine guns in the US military are supplied by FN. One of FBI''s two primary sniper rifles is made by FN. The FN-FNP45 was recently made to compete in planned trials for selecting a new sidearm , which never took place.\n\nBackground and history of FN Five-Seven will take a while for me to write, but to make things short and simple, this pistol is chambered for the 5.7x28mm round, which has body-armor piercing capabilities. The higher velocity round also gives the pistol a slightly longer effective range. The round, I believe, has not been introduced to Pakistan, and neither is the pistol. Except for a version made for civilians in the US, I believe this pistol to have seen little action other than in the hands of special forces.\n\nThough FN''s total lack of presence in Pakistan puzzles me... I can only think that FN being a major military supplier has something to do with it.\n\nHope that helps.', ''),
(54059, ' maybe the PLAS-TUK cover is just there to keep the dust out... :P', ''),
(54060, ' @ Abu Hafs,\n\nSpringfield XD is built in Croatia as far as I know. Springfield imports them and sell them in the US with their name on it. It has its own following in the US, as is generally known as a downright decent handgun. Which incidentally says a lot since its made in East Europe.\n\nFNP-45 is a new relatively newly designed handgun by FN. But I have not seen favorable reviews as regards their build quality. But this is not a first hand opinion. I have not seen one in Pakistan.\n\nThe Chinese handgun I believe is now their military standard issue. I think it uses a proprietary caliber (correct me if I am wrong here), which is why probably it has aroused less than significant interest in our corner of the world. \n\nFNs Five SeveN being on top is a bit of a surprise for me and now I am doubting the video authors expertise in handgun ratings (even though two of my fav handguns did pretty well in his ratings). It may sound as a great handgun, but in my opinion it is a bit flawed. \n\nReason I''m saying this is because, firstly, you cannot get the AP ammo (SS190 or something I cant remember numbers n stuff). So there goes penetration out of the window.\n\nSecondly, for these small calibers to work, they need adequate velocity in order to tumble and yaw when they change medium (from air to human). While that may be achieved through a rifle, the handgun barrel hardly accelerates the projectile to reach velocities than enable it to tumble upon impact. What you are left with is a fancy .22 magnum.\n\nSo basically, its not penetrating, and its not yawing, and its not fast enough. Add to that its expensive, and the bullets still more expensive. Unless you have a large supply of the military grade ammo, it has little use for the average person.\n\nOn the plus side though, It must be easier to take head shots due to lower recoil. And you have twenty rounds in the mag. Plus if you have the P90 it complements that.', ''),

The steel rod does not capture the spring ether from what have been able to see (I may be wrong on this) which the polymer one does, so you do not loose the spring inadvertently.  \n\nIn today''s world synthetic materials are in some cases superior to the older more traditional ones.  I have not heard of anyone having a malfunction with the plastic rod, neither here in Pakistan or in the US (check the forums).  The Cougar is not a new design, it has been around for a long time and any issues have been sorted out.   \n\nMy understanding is that Stoegar have changed over to the metal rod for purely cosmetic reasons.

(54184, ' The COP 357 was a 4 shot Derringer type pistol chambered for the .357 magnum round. It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon.\n\nManufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of Torrance, California, the double action COP packed the power of 4 rounds of short-barreled .357 magnum in a package only slightly larger than the typical .25 ACP pistol, which made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun.\n\nCOP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police.\n\n[b][u]Specifications[/u][/b]\n\n* Caliber: .357 Magnum (Can fire .38 Special as well.)\n* Weight: 1.75 lb (0.8 kg) empty.\n* Height: 4.1 inches (10.4 cm).\n* Length: 5.6 inches (14.2 cm).\n* Width: 1.062 inches (2.7 cm).\n* Action: Break-open with extractors for reloading, double action trigger with rotating firing pin selector.\n\n[b][u]Construction and operation of the COP 357[/u][/b]\n\nThe C.O.P. 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. The pistol actually has a unique 4-into-1 barrel. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that "pops-up" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older "pepperboxes" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 is unique in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.\n\nTwo frequent complaints about the COP 357 are that it is too heavy to be used as a backup gun, and that the trigger pull is too heavy for rapid fire—even heavier than most modern revolvers.\n\n[u][b]User Manual[/b][/u]\n[url]http://technoace.net/cop.pdf[/url]\n\nVideo Links:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQM-wERs-VE[/url]\n\n[img]http://www.tucsonguns.com/pic/2007-7/00-7-20-07-112.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.tucsonguns.com/pic/2007-7/00-7-20-07-126.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.tucsonguns.com/pic/2007-7/00-7-20-07-117.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.tucsonguns.com/pic/2007-7/00-7-20-07-122.jpg[/img]\n\nSource: \n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP_357_Derringer[/url]\n[url]http://www.gunwebsites.com/Articles.php?action=detail&g=content1185154434[/url]', ''),

(54435, ' Fellow members.  What has taken place with Shahnawaz, the son of the well known and respected Abdul Karim is a great tragedy.  Shahnawaz was released on Bail last night, after being charged under section 13D of the Pakistan Arms Ordinance.  I have seen the FIR and 2 of my licensed weapons are listed on it as well as three other weapons that i know for sure are licensed because they belong to people who are well known to me.  although i can not speak for the other weapons listed on the FIR i am sure they are all licensed and were at the shop for repairs.  The basis for this arrest was when the in-charge of the Police Maal Khana was arrested with 1 AK-47 1 Glock 1 S&W and 8 Kilos of Charas.  upon interrogation and while trying to save him self he implicated the son of Abdul Karim (who''s name he did not even know and  kept calling him Shahjahan).  \n\nThe picture in the Dawn News paper shows a police official in a stripped shirt showing a pistol and holding a rifle that looks like a G3 with a Dragunov butt stock.  That rifle belongs to me and is 100% legal and licensed.  I find it insulting and offensive that these policemen are harassing honest law abiding gun owners and honest Gunsmiths who are well known across the world (A few years ago when i contacted Holland and Holland in the UK regarding restoration of an old H&H rifle they also said to me that "Mr. Abdul Karim of the London Arms Repair Shop in Gizri, Karachi is one of the finest Gunsmiths we know and is highly qualified to restore your weapon to Holland & Holland Standards".  \n\nIt is our duty as gun enthusiasts and sportsmen to support such people to the full extent of our abilities.

(54484, ' Hunting Optics\nNo hunter can be without a good Binocular. The binoculars are basically of two types the Porro Prism and the Roof Prism. These are recognizable as the Roof prism have straight barrels ( the objective lense and the eye piece are in line) and the Porro have bulging sides and are heavier and bulkier the eye piece and the objective lens are not in a straight line.\nThe porro is a very old design but it is brighter, and takes a lot of punishment without being damaged when dropped or mishandled, and even if not of a top make it is usable; on the other hand the Roof Prism are lighter, less bulkier but very difficult to properly collimate with the result these are not really usable unless of  a top maker. These can be damaged easily as if dropped these can easily go out of collimation. The very top makers are how ever very robust and as bright and comfortable to use as a good quality porro. Good quality binoculars of both types by top makers are are nearly as expansive or twice as expansive as a new rifle. \nTo judge the quality of a bincular one has to examine it closely, pick up a bino and hold it at an arms length and look at the eye piece, you will see the eye piece will appear black with a small bright circle,  the bright circle is known as the EXIT PUPIL.\nThis is the effective area through which you see.\nWe will go through some definations so the young hunters are with us. The Eye Piece is the lens next to the eye when you view through a bino.\nThe OBJECTIVE lens is the one at the far end of the bino.\nThe figures 8x 40 mean; Magnification is 8 times and the Diameter of the objective lens is is 40 mm.\nFigures 6-24 x50 would be on a zoom bino which means the magnification is zoom able from 6 to 24 times and the obj lens dia is 40 mm.\nNow if you divide the obj lens dia by the magnification you will get the diameter of the EXIT PUPIL, also the exit pupil should be round and sharp otherwise you can tell it is of poor quality and some lense or prism is mis aligned.\nNow in low light the human eyes pupil dailates to about 7mm so if you want to use your bino in low light you can not take advantage of a bino which is say 10x30 as the exit pupil would be only 3 mm and  your eye would be 7 mm and you will find it very hard to use  due to black circles interfaring with your vision.\nIn low light a bino with 7x50 is ideal along with 8x56, and the 7x42 or the 10x40 a good compromise as the binos with larger objective lenses are heavier and bulkier.\nAll binos appear to be the same in bright light when you view through these for a short while. I wish you do not experience the murderous headache that follows after using a poor quality or out of collimation bino in the field as one glasses for hours looking for Ibex or Urial and only a few minutes is enough to ruin your day.\nIn the field one can handle only a 10 x bino that also sitting down and resting ones fore arms, easier to use are 7 or 8 x anything bigger than 10 will be unsteady .\nI think I will touch other aspects later.\nAll experienced hunters will use binos with a magnification of 6 or 7 or 8 and 10 in case of mountain hunting in mostly bright light. \nAnimals move during low light early in the morning or late evening that is when these figure stand out.         \nI would like to suggest that keep magnification on the lower side and the size of the objective lens around 40 mm or more.\nThen there are the sharpness, resolution,colour correctness and other aspects I will submit later', ''),

It looked really nice and the finish was also superb. Unfortunately it was giving a lot of problems with the older POF ammo that we had. We switched to a newer 2008 stock and it worked fine.

This practice should consist of rapid draw and retention shooting.  \n\nLike at :45 of this video:\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bybVAMJ6J24[/url]\n\nand also...\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0tOdgy5aBA[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv_jLVxPfkM[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykmchwOgqE[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c06mH6x2Ntc[/url]\n\n3 yards- anytime someone is attacking you with something capable of causing great bodily harm or death you should be attempting to create distance.  It''s generally not difficult to create a 3 yard distance between you and someone else.  You will want to be using some confirmation of the sights, but you may not have time to obtain an perfect sight picture.  At 3 yards you don''t need a perfect sight picture, but confirmation that the gun is pointed at the target.\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qTNKdUqWzQ[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vatAAeeIUs&NR=1[/url]\n\n1-3 yards may also be a bit more like the distance you would engage someone who has knocked you to the ground and is threatening you with a club, bat, rock, knife or gun.\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bVEAPgrXz0[/url]\n\nAlso remember that if someone charges you from some further distance to club or stab you, they will likely be right on top of you (1-3 yards) by the time you draw your concealed firearm.\n\n[b]X [/b]yards- not all self-defense shooting will be out in the public.  It may very well be inside your home.  What I recommend is that you look around your home for the most likely distance you may have to engage a person threatening you inside your home.  How long is a hallway, top of stair to bottom of stairs, your favorite reading chair to the doorway, etc.  These are also the distances you will want to practice.  Note where cover or concealment is and then practice shooting from the position you will be using.  If you have a large hard-wood desk, then practice shooting while crouched behind something, like you would have to shoot from behind the desk.\n\nDo not neglect movement with your practice:\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhW4TXYqkxQ&feature=related[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUz5pJrytA0[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGvz87bw2m0[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvHyMVp03M[/url]\n\nNeeding to defend yourself or your home with a gun is a grave situation.

The difference should be obvious. \n\nIf you are asking about Turkish clones, they are not clones but copies of the CZ design and carry the Turkish logo and markings, often by the name of Dolphin or Cynic.

(54799, ' In summary:\n\nThe double tap was a once popular technique for shooting threats using two aimed shots fired with little time between the two shots.\n\nThe double tap has been replaced with the shoot until the threat has stopped philosophy (which I happen to agree with).\n\n[quote=Dr Zakir]also would love to have info and experience on double tap[/quote]\n\n"Double tap," is a slang term which began with understanding that a handgun cartridge is NOT very likely to stop a man threatening you with great bodily harm or death.  One should shoot him twice, at least, or "tap" him twice, which grew into the phrase, "double tap."\n\nI was trained in law forcement to shoot twice and then assess.  The proverbial "double tap"  and assess.  But even that has fallen into disfavor with LE.  Officers would shoot twice, stop shooting, and get hurt or killed because even after being shot twice sometimes the threat hadn''t stopped.\n\nAnother thing happened to the double tap- it became a speed contest.  Everyone seeing how fast they could draw and shoot two shots.  If you look at both IPSC/USPSA and IDPA style sport shooting you will see that each target has to be shot twice (except for steel targets which will fall down).  This is the direct decendent of the "double tap."\n\nThe problem with too much speed is loss of accuracy.  People stopped aiming two shots. When this guy states, the double tap is a "two well aimed shots with very little time between," he is absolutely correct:\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbg2s2bfjhw[/url]\n\nThough there is truth in the statement, "any shot which hits him, is good for me and bad for him;" there is also truth in the fact that some guys will not stop just because you shot off his earlobe.  So our shots will always need to be, "aimed."\n\nHowever, "aiming" is term which is different from "sighting."  Sighting refers to using the sights, but not all shots have to be aimed with the sights, they can be aimed by pointing the forearm at the threat in very close distances.  It can also be aimed by extending the arms in a two handed grip and seeing the gun imposed upon the threat.  \n\nPlease allow me to make clear- it is dependent upon how close the threat is and how well you can shoot.  If the threat is more distant, you will need use the sights.  But it is possible to hit an 8" circle out to 11 yards without "sighting" and only "aiming."  In these videos I shot a Glock 17 from which the sights were removed. I simply aimed the gun through orientation of the firearm on the target:\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ymH3qcHPA[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K89okVqEjEQ[/url]\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDNW9BL-UmE[/url]\n\nSorry, I got off track there.\n\nBack to the "double tap."  As I was saying the double tap fell out of favor because officers shot twice, stopped... and were hurt or killed because they ceased trying to stop the threat.\n\nCurrently law enforcement in the U.S. is being taught to shoot until the threat has stopped, and to shoot only as fast as can make accurate hits.  Often this is qualified as an 6" - 8" circle in the center or upper center chest.  \n\nIn slang terms, "you pour bullets into the threat" until the threat stops or turns away or drops the weapon.  It may mean one shot, or three or thirteen.  Whatever it takes to stop the threat.\n\nThere is a saying which goes along with this understandin: "if I''m justified in shooting him once, I am justified in shooting him a bunch of times."  \n\nIt''s part of the reason why you hear about American cops shooting a person a whole bunch of times- they were justified because the threat had not stopped being a threat.\n\nRemember:\n\nIf the threat is close, you can shoot faster/aim with less confirmation.  As the distance to the threat increases you have to shoot slower/have more confirmation.\n\n[img]http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/7237/29163048jb7.jpg[/img]\n\nIf you introduce movement (your movement to avoid a knife, the threats movement, or both) you will need to "aim" more.\n\nBut you shoot until the threat is stopped.\n\nWhen my wife and I practice she will shoot the target up to 5 times with her Kahr CW9.\n\nThe shoot until the threat has stopped philosophy has already been warped into how many shots can one shoot in a single second.  If you search you tube you will see some people who are posting videos that they can fire, 4, 5, 6 or more shots in a single second.', ''),

In a fight, the only way to to survive and win is to keep your head and make your shots count...[/quote]\n\nExactly, my friend!  There is no guarantee that the gun fight you find yourself in will be anything like you imagined or what you trained for, but fast accurate shooting always helps.\n\nI''ve heard the following stated:  Situations dictate tactics, tactics dictate techniques, techniques dictate nothing.\n\nYou deal with the reality of the situation first, decide what tactic you will employ, and use the proper technique for that tactic.\n\nAnother mentality is to, "have a lot of tools in your tool box."  I know it sounds a little cliche.\n\nIt means don''t just be able to shoot accurate at 25 meters, be able to shoot fast and accurate at 7 meters. Be able to shoot accurately and fast while moving to the rear and obliques. Be able to draw fast and shoot rapidly at a target right on top of you.  Then you have 4 "tools" to use for various situations as dictated.  Now learn to shoot from your back and from around or under cover (a car) and you have 7 tools.', ''),

(54887, ' Hello Omer bhai. Zeroing in your red dot sight need not be a lengthy process at all, provided you use the correct technique and instruments. In fact, it can be done in less than 1 minute! But for this you need to have at your disposal a cartridge type laser boresighter corresponding to the caliber of ammo your gun fires. Insert it into the chamber and bolt your rifle. Now target anything at the distance you wish to zero your sight at and adjust the knobs of your sight, both the X and Y so that the red dot that you see within your sight overlaps the red dot being emitted from your barrel! Your sight is now zeroed at this distance! I did this with a 9mm handgun, a friend of mine had the laser cartridge and we zeroed in the gun without a single fire. The manual way, if you do not have a laser boresighter is a bit more complicated and tricky. You need a  solidly grounded bipod for this to mount your gun onto. Now after determining the desired distance you wish your gun zeroed in to, it would best to use a target board to fire at. First fire would be the genuine line and length of your gun-barrel. Now look through your scope and aim at the hole on the target board that your first bullet made and fire again. Measure the distance in inches between the two shots and start adjusting your scope accordingly. Usually one click in either direction, both of X and Y, moves the aim of the scope about 1/4 of an inch. The whole process should be over in less than 15 shots if you work persistently. Yet, I must say the laser boresighter, if available, is best and easiest way to deal with this matter. You won''t even need to step out of your house, it can be done in the backyard even! As regards your last question, Eutech and Aimpoint are the best of red dot scopes available abroad, even used by U.S army. Prices of these start from around $400 to $700. Of what is mostly available in Pakistan, there are many different models like Simmons, Leapers, etc, ranging anywhere between Rs. 5000 to Rs. 15000. Hope these 2 cents helped you a bit!', ''),

Sir, last time I eyed this thing was in Jamrud (Karkhana bazaar). Some 4 months back. The guy had a set of 4 different calibers, inclusive of one 12 gauge cartridge. I was looking for the one in Cal. 7.62x39, which he had unfortunately sold out @20000! Would you believe me? I had to ask him twice, whether if he meant the whole set or a single cartridge and he told me that he was charging 20000 for each of the rounds in the set! Thus 1 lakh for the whole set of 5, the original price of which would not be more than 100-150 U.S dollars, if possible to have imported directly or via somebody returning from abroad. If you know of anybody who could help with this, let me know, I have been looking for this thing since long.

Weapon lights can betray your own position to your adversary if used incorrectly (i.e. constantly on instead of momentary use, whitewalling etc) you can draw fire towards yourself. Second with a weapon mounted light you are forced to point the weapon in directions which might not be a target. So it also depends on the situation and need. Weapon lights are fine as long as you have a backup flashlight on hand as well. \n\nI have used both lasermax and crimson trace lasers and i found often the laser bouncing all over the place with live fire recoil.

The manufacturer may be of one opinion, me another and someone else of a thrid opinion.  \n\nOne option is to not truly zero it (meaning the bullet hits the red laser dot.  \n\nInstead "zero" at 15 yards so that the red dot is 1" below the point of impact if the laser is 1" below the bore.  Or the red dot is 1" to the 4 o''clock of point of impact if that is where the laser is placed.   \n\nAt 15 to 25 yards you really can''t tell a 1" difference anyways.  But if you "zero" for 5 yards, at 10 yards it is 1" off at 15 yards it is 2" off, at 20 yards it is 3" off and 25 yrds it is 4" off, which is two times the difference for than the non-zero.   \n\nWhat''s 4" ?? I don''t know, maybe a miss, maybe not, which is the point. The "zero" really won''t matter unless the zero is way off the mark.  \n\n[u][b]Most people can''t obtain a goup measuring 1" when shooting rapidly at 3 - 7 yrds under life or death stress anyways.[/b][/u] \n\nHere is the chart for a .45 auto 230 grn cartridge:\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/aVO7hE0.png[/img][/url]\n\nAs you can see out to 30 yards there is less than 1" deviation between point of aim and point of impact due to bullet "rise" and "drop" (no gotcha comments on the use of "rise" and "drop," please)\n\n\nThe 9mm 115 grn fairs a bit better (because it is moving faster):\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/4579/73745474.png[/img][/url]\n\n\nThe images above are from this webpage:\n[url]http://le.atk.com/ballistics/speer/speer_ballistics.aspx[/url]', ''),

Usually this means night time.  Sometimes (rarely) it means inside a "darkened" place like and alley or poorly lit space.  \n\nThis isn''t surprising given that criminals like the dark as it hides them and makes identifying them more difficult.\n\nBut diminshed light does not mean total darkness.  As you go about your business at night start making mental notes as to how dark it really is.  How far away can you identify a face or determine what is in someone''s hands.  \n\nGo out and about on your property and practice seeing your sights. And note how the lighting on and inside your home and others affects your ability to see a potential threat or identity a weapon. Lights shining in your eyes from behind the threat are bad for you and good for him.  The revearse is true, if the light is behind you it illuminates him, your sights, and makes it difficult for him see what you are doing.  A really bright flashlight is a great aid.  But I find that at night, nearly 100% of the places I go are lit well enough to see and engage a threat.  \n\nEven inside my home, the illumination from street lights and neighbors homes coming through the windows allows me to see and engage a threat inside my home.\n\n"What about loosing night-vision?" you may ask.\n"Have you tested your concern?"

I have used it at my home in the village. I have fired at paper targets and taken out countless lizards (at night time).\n\nThis was the minimum strength Gamo air rifle available. At first i thought this to be a disadvantage but now i am glad i got this. The reason being that with this gun the pellets have significant amount of ricochet when hitting walls. Wearing eye protection is a must. The lizards also fly away with the pellet and land at a considerable distance. At distances using open sights this airgun is adequate enough for the task. If i has got a higher powered airgun the ricochet would have been lethal and the risk of over kill significant. I can safely use it at my home in karachi as i know the airgun''s limit. If i had a more powerful airgun i would not have been as comfortable using it inside the house or outside in city environment.\n\nIt is proven by hadith that it is ok to kill house lizards.

(55141, ' Omer571 bro, you seem all set to have your guns fully equipped! Good, this is my hobby also, a gun should be complete in all senses! Now, as far as your red dot sight is concerned, Denovo 87 is quite right that most of these available over here have no magnifying factor, mostly just 1x and rarely just 2x, not enabling you to conveniently target distant objects. Secondly, I''m not quite sure they would be able to retain zero settings for too long, when used for the heavier calibers, for this you would need as I stated earlier the Eotech and Aimpoint types, which are far more expensive and also hard- getters. One option could be that you went for a good quality illuminated reticle scope with a magnifying factor. It depends, what you want to use it for, if Ibex hunting, than definetely 1x or 2x wouldn''t serve your purpose at all. If you need the sure-shot aiming capability just for SD purpose, another good option is to have your gun mounted with \na reasonably good quality laser sight. The ones for rifles are larger in size than the ones for handguns and they are pretty accurate. Excellent hip-fire plinking! No aim, no need to bring your gun to shoulder position!

(55263, ' Practice shooting in the pre-season. \n\nToo many duck and goose hunters leave their shotguns in their gun safes until opening day. Then they wonder why they can''t hit anything. The easy answer is, they''re out of sync. \nThis problem is easily corrected with some pre-season shooting practice. A dove field is one of the best possible training grounds for waterfowl hunters. Doves present the same relative angles and distances as ducks and geese, shooters get to practice these shots repeatedly. Shooting sporting clays is another practice option. \n\n[u][b]DUCK SHOOTING[/b][/u]\nWhen a flight of ducks comes into the decoys, many hunters shoot...at the flight! They don''t single out one bird, and concentrate strictly on it. An incoming flight of ducks is 95 percent air. This is why you need to lock in on one bird, and stay with it until it drops. Don''t "flock shoot." Don''t switch targets. Don''t let the excitement of the moment shatter your focus.\nTake the last or highest bird in an incoming fight. When ducks or geese are about to land, most hunters focus on the closest, lowest, easiest shot, and two or more hunters wind up shooting at the same bird. Instead, take a trailer with the first shot. Then your shotgun will be in the right plane to shoot flaring birds on the second and third shots. Also, you''ll have the satisfaction of knowing you downed birds that no other hunters were shooting.\n\n\n[b]DUCK SHOOTING PACKAGES.[/b]\nMany hunters from Pakguns.com forum, asked me about duck shooting packages.\nHunting Masters going to restart duck shooting services; with effect from 3rd week of October 2009.\nShooting spots should be downstream Head Marala, upstream Head Khanki, upstream Head Qadar Abad, and upstream Head Rasool. \n[u][b]SERVICES[/b][/u]\n1.

(55276, ' 1. As far as close ranges are concerned, a single shot in one second with drawing a weapon at 3 yds,  while a double tap in1-2 seconds with drawing a weapon is the preferred practice for close combat. Time plus accuracy are more important. A not very well placed shot may not stop the threat but can buy you some time for a second shot. A well placed double tap with 9mm JHP or .357 Magnum will for sure, in most of the cases, stop the threat.\n\n2. Regarding practicing at close ranges, I have following to offer.\nUsually the administration does not allow to practice so close to targets as other members may inadvertently start shooting from 25 Yards thus endangering the security of members. Secondly at such a close range, if the stop butt is very close to target, the bullets may ricochet and endanger the firer. Yes if the stop butt is away then it may be possible. But for short ranges located in cities with no bullet arrestor at the top increases the ricochet chances if you pitch the target quite far away from the stop butt. And in some cases a head shot at a target pitched away from the stop butt, fired from a shorter height firer, may go straight in air or hit the top most area of stop butt thus favoring a ricochet. I hope I made my point clear doctor sahib', ''),

(55325, ' An air rifle is a big package of fun if used wisely. I will not recommend giving it to youngsters until they develop a sense of responsibilty and maturity of thinking.\n\nWhat i mean is that one has to treat it with respect just like anyother firearm. If you dont treat it with respect it can cause you and your loved ones around you irreparable harm.\n\nWhile handling it make sure the safety is always ON only just before you shoot turn it OFF, Never point it at anyone or anything that you dont want to shoot at even if it is empty, while loading keep your finger away from the trigger and safety ON otherwise if fired in that position the barrel can hit you with tremendous force in the face or if you happen to put your finger at the break point (where the barrel breaks from the frame) can result in cut fingers. \n\nI am right handed, to load i place the Buttplate at my hip region and with gun pointed at an angle to my body using my left hand (grasping the solid end of the frame, no where near the trigger) and the Safety ON. I then grasp the end of the barrel with my right hand and load it. Then i put the pellet in using my right hand and then return the barrel to the earlier position again using right hand. All this time the gun is held solidly against my body with my left hand. In this position if the gun was to fire my right hand would have controlled the barrel hitting my face and during this entire action my fingers are no where near the breaking part that might have caused them to be cut in two.\n\nNow that the gun is loaded always point it in a direction where if the pellet was to be fired no harm would be done. You have to make a habit of using your brain quite often. You have to think each time before shooting at an intended target. You have to always plan for what if the pellet does not hit the target and what will happen if it hits the target. You should know ahead of taking your shot what will happen. For example when i shoot i look at what is behind the target (a mud wall or a concrete wall or a brick wall or a tree or a bush, a rubber tire) these are just a few examples and all will give different results like the mud wall will absorb the pellet in itself, the concrete wall will cause it to ricochet at tremendous speed, the brick wall will cause less speed ricochet, a tree if it is hard wood will cause tremendous high speed ricochet, a bush will let the pellet pass (now what is behind the bush?), a rubber tire will again cause high speed ricochet. \n\nNow with the speed and type of ricochet expected we will have to predict the angle of deflection. It is just like putting a ball in a hole at a game of pool or snooker. Remember Newtons law every action has an equal and opposite reaction. For example you hit a concrete wall at an angle of 45 degree from the left side it will deflect the pellet with speed towards the right at an angle of 45 degree. So you understand if you fire at the wall standing in front of it the pellet will come flying towards you (what if it hits you in the eye?).\n\nAllah swt has given you only one set of eyes so always wear eye protection. Not the ordinary glasses but polycarbon glasses. They are tough and will not shatter they are also used in bullet proof glass as layers. I got mine from Shaheen traders for Rs.1,500.\n\nAlso always make sure the people around you know you are shooting and ask them to move over if you feel the pellet can come there way.\n\nNow i hope you understand why this low powered air rifle when compared to gamo shadow is best for use inside home, and in city. The limit of ricochet can be judged and the possibility of overkill minimised. Overkill is if the pellet does not hit the target it can travel at lethal speed and hit something behind it like a man passing on the road. Or the pellet can pass right through the targets body and hit something behind again at lethal speeds.\n\nNow if i had the same gun in .17 caliber instead of .22 the pellet would have generated more speed therefore the possibility of high speed ricochets and overkill would have been more.\n\nAlso .22 is more suitable for hunting because .17 pellet is only useful if you make a head shot. if you take a body shot the pellet will either pass through and the animal will run away or if you are lucky the pellet will hit a bone. With .22 a head shot will work and the body shot will put the animal in a state of shock and you will have time to put another pellet into it. Also it will penetrate and stay inside the body of the victim.\n\nANOTHER IMPORTANT THING LEAD IS POISONOUS, can cause CANCER and IMPOTENCY. Do not touch your face or eat anything while shooting with your hands. Always wash them thoroughly after shooting.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1707/79088761.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/9153/46612756.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/gx23nMo9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/7091/84943043.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/5263/96102978.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

Any visitor touching your site will see all those beautiful pictures less the estimates. I hope I have not hit the "Achilles Heels"  :)[/quote]\n\n\nDear Malik Sahib,\n\nYour question is very good and important. Main reason is, other than Iran Turky, Aazerbaijan China, and Pakistan but only few more states are the natural hunting grounds. But in USA, Scotland, Africa & Australia is offering hunting at private ranches and normally they are feeding and caring to the game by artificial ways. \n\nMany game tags are designed for solo hunts or with non hunter group members. For these country hunter is having wide range of choice and contacts of many service providers matching with their budgets. But here is nothing.\nSo, they can easily define tag price, Tag prices are same, but price can be fluctuate according to services.\n\nIn Pakistan  Ibex, Urial, Markhore Blue Sheep tag prices are not secret but services charges by outfitters are the main secrets. Every out fitter is not a good hunter; outfitters are depending upon good guides in Pakistan. But every good hunter can become a good outfitter.\n\nFor Ibex , Urial & Markhor any body can become good host or agent if he is having little bit outdoor life experience, and become good business man in this field if he is having reasonable capital amount with basic knowledge of proceedings.\n\nVery few hunters are coming direct to Pakistani outfitters normally local out fitters are dealing with an agents (middle men), so by this way prices are high for hunters and outfitters are earning big profits.\n\nLocal out fitters are avoiding to the local hunters, because outfitter is earring big profit from foreigner comparatively local client. For example for the Wild Boar Driven hunt Price is 2800.USD to 3400.USD per hunter, normally recommended group size is 6 to 9 hunter, with minimum 5 hunting days.\nBut for the same services and the method of hunt you can’t earn this good amount, so why outfitter will deal with locals?\n\nBut Hunting Masters is is different we are working for promotion of local market.\nSecondly, technically problem is, for Wild Boar, Partridge, Duck shoot and for spotlight hunts we can’t publish exact prices for local or for foreigner, prices always stand for the required services and according to the number of joining members.\n\nWe can publish recommended group sizes, but prices will be different according to packages.\nSo, an easy way to get exact prices, first you send your requirements for the services,, duration of hunt and joining members. \n\nBest regards.\n\nSyed Ali Fazroq.\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', ''),

Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point. \nWhen I arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. I watched silently for a short time and then went into the house.\nI was gone only a few minutes. When I came out again I handed her a toothbrush. ''When you finish cutting the grass,'' I said, ''you might as well sweep the driveway.''\nAnd then the fight started...  :D', ''),

And like the 6.5x55, it became a popular hunting cartridge world-wide. The 7x57 is another one of those well balanced cartridges that seems to kill game better than its paper specifications suggest that it should. Or maybe it is just that most of us fail to realize that increasing the velocity and power of a .284 inch bullet much beyond 7x57 levels gets us into the realm of rapidly diminishing returns. The longer .280 Remington and other similar capacity cartridges actually add little killing power, but their increased recoil and muzzle blast make it seem as if they do.\n\nThe truth is that the 7x57 has proven itself adequate for even the world''s biggest game under the right circumstances. The same WDM Bell that I wrote about in the section on the 6.5x55, famous slayer of African elephants for their ivory, used the 7x57 extensively. He appreciated the light recoil, accuracy, and deep penetration of the 175 grain FMJ 7mm bullet, and felt that the combination made a superb cartridge for executing elephants with precisely placed brain shots.\n\nFor the North American deer hunter, or the hunter of similar size game world-wide, the 139-145 grain bullets factory loaded to about 2700 fps make a good choice. These give the 7x57 a reasonably flat trajectory and hit plenty hard enough for most North American big game. Hornady offers a Light Magnum load that gives their 139 grain SP bullet a MV of 2950 fps. This makes the 7x57 an effective long range cartridge.\n\nThe 7x57, like many of the sensible cartridges, is under loaded by the major ammo companies in deference to the old military rifles that are still out there in the hands of the public. The official industry pressure for the 7x57 is 46,000 cup. 7x57 cartridges for modern rifles can be safely loaded to 50,000 cup, and this allows reloaders to drive the popular 139-140 grain bullets at about 2800 fps.\n\nFor large game like elk and moose, the 150-160 grain bullets are probably preferable, and these can be driven to velocities in the 2600-2700 fps range. The Norma factory load drives a 150 grain bullet at a MV of 2690.\n\nThe very heavy 175 grain bullets (SD .310) offer more penetration than is probably required for any North American game, but can be driven to about 2500 fps. The factory loads take this weight bullet to 2440 fps.\n\nModerate recoil makes for accurate shooting, and this has always been the 7x57''s forte. According to my Rifle Recoil Table, the 140 grain bullet at 2700 fps in an 8 pound rifle generates about 12.5 ft. lbs. of recoil energy. At 2800 fps the 140 grain bullet fired in the same rifle kicks with about 14 ft. lbs. of energy, still under the 15 ft. lb. level that allows most riflemen to do their best shooting.\n\nConsidering its all-around performance (including trajectory, killing power, and recoil) the 7x57 is nearly an ideal 7mm cartridge.

(55443, ' On Sunday I was at the range to shoot competition.  And older man was there chatting with the Director but soon left.  Shortly afterwards the director told me the man had brought out a Night Hawk Custom and a Wilson CQB.  He was letting people inspect and even shoot a few rounds through them.\n\nI quickly followed him to another part of the range and engaged him in conversation which I quickly turned to the two guns he had with him\n\nI recently read an article on the Night Hawk Custom T3, which was the same model he had with him.  I was really looking forward to fondling the T3 since the article so fawned over the T3.\n[url]http://www.nighthawktactical.com/T3_ultimate.html[/url]\n[img]http://www.nighthawktactical.com/t3/t3-uccp.jpg[/img]\nNow the pictures on the webpage are gorgeous.  The owner found the grips too agressive and had placed some Wilson Combat Starburst pattern grips on the gun.\n[url]http://www.wilsoncombat.com/g10starburst.asp[/url]\n[img]http://www.handgunsmag.com/featured_handguns/HG_pearlpistol_200903-A4.jpg[/img]\nThe grips were good looking, but I didn''t appreciate them on the all black gun.  I thought the black grips original to the T3 looked better.\n\nI shot it.  Oh, yes you bet I did!\n\nI was a bit dissappointed.  I humbly accept that such a statement sounds arrogant, but the trigger wasn''t great, a bit heavy and just kind of... unpleasant.  It was accurate.  It also was sort of displeased with the recoil.  Not that it was snappy or hard or twisted or such, I suspect that I am very used to the recoil of a full sized 1911.\n\nI appreciated the small and subtle but present magwell.\n\nNext the owner afforded me the chance to shoot the Wilson CQB.  \n[url]http://www.wilsoncombat.com/p_cqb_compact.asp[/url]\n[img]http://www.wilsoncombat.com/handguns/cqb_compact/large/12.jpg[/img]\n\nThis gun was also very accurate, the trigger was much better than the T3.  The recoil felt better, maybe it was a matter of spring weight or frame to slide fit.  Now if it had a magwell it would be about perfect.\n\nBoth guns fired a magazine without hiccup.  \n\nI reciprocated and let the owner fire my Kimber.  Good times at a range are made of moments like that.  Three well made 1911s being shot by 1911 fans.', ''),

Would I be right in saying that something which works for military and law enforcement may not necessarily be the best for civilian carry?[/quote]\n\n\nI totally agree that something which works well for LEAs may not work necessarily well for the civilians. There is nothing wrong with being a civilian, its just the training which matters. While most of the civilian gun enthusiasts at this forum may be more cautious and expert than an average LEA person but thats not true for all the civilians carrying arms. It would be better to have a chambered round with safety on rather than chambering the one at need or carrying a chambered weapon. I would also submit that unlike most LEAs, a civilian may not encounter a gun battle or there are very less chances, if I may put in these words, except for (GOD forbids) an HD / SD situation. Now you do not carry a loaded or even a chambered weapon at your house. Lets be practical guys. So for a person at home and trying to ward off a threat it is hardly an issue that the weapon is chambered or not. He has time. And if he is woken with a gun pointing towards his head, a chambered weapon is also as useless or as good as is a non chambered one. That is a hard fact. Most of us have never fired at a human being and I sincerely wish such a situation should not arise, however, if some one has fired he will bear me out that it takes more than a chambered weapon to fire at a human being. \n\nNot withstanding the last argument, I have always propagated revolvers for HD. No chambering required, no loading / unloading required, No conceal carry issue, no lengthy battles (need for more capacity)', ''),

(55859, ' Mohan Jauhari of Asst Dir of the Central Forensic Laboratory in Calcutta writes about Ricochet that "When a bullet strikes  target of sufficient solidarity at low angle it mays, while maintaining its integrity, be deflected from its original path as a result of impact and travel in a direction quite different than its original one. Such a deflection of bullet constitute a true ricochet". \n\nRicochet is phenomenon of a low rather than high velocity. This is because high velocity bullets such as .223 caliber travelling at 2800fps have a propensity to fragment upon impact rather than be deflected. This of course depends on the bullet design and composition, substrate composition and other variables like  bullet shape, velocity (and distance), target material and the angle of incidence. Steeper the angle less chances of ricochet. In rare cases, ricochets can return to the shooter. This occurs when the object struck possesses enough resistance to withstand the impact of the bullet, and whose surface is perpendicular to the shooter. Some bullets are designed to deform at the nose, which is the main reason for the bullet ricocheting at such an extreme angle and returning in the shooter''s direction.\n\nRicochets are often more common with low power calibers such as .22 or .177 calibre, which can have trouble penetrating some materials, although a ricochet can occur with any caliber.', ''),

The incident follows a series of scandals surrounding American use of private contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe raid on two offices of the Inter-Risk company is especially sensitive because of a slew of recent rumors and media reports that U.S. embassy expansion plans in Pakistan include hiring the security firm formerly known as Blackwater.\n\nThe U.S. says there is no truth in the reports, but they have resonated with the many Pakistanis familiar with allegations that Blackwater employees were involved in unprovoked killings of Iraqi civilians.\n\nPolice official Rana Akram said that two Inter-Risk employees were arrested and being questioned. He said authorities were also seeking the company''s owner, a retired Pakistani army captain.\n\nReporters were shown the weapons – 61 assault rifles and nine pistols – that were seized by dozens of police from the sites in pre-dawn raids in the capital, Islamabad.\n\nU.S. Embassy spokesman Rick Snelsire said the U.S. contract with Inter-Risk to provide security at the embassy and consulates took effect this year. It is believed to be the first U.S. contract for the firm, Snelsire said. He did not know how long the contract was for or what it was worth.\n\n"Our understanding is they obtained licenses with whatever they brought into the country to meet the contractual needs," he said. "We told the government that we had a contract with Inter-Risk."\n\nA man who answered the phone number listed for the company and identified himself as Riaz Hussain said a raid had occurred, but gave no more information.\n\nAccording to Inter-Risk''s Web site, it was first formed in 1988 and offers wireless home alarm systems as well as security guards and other services.\n\nThough the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad does have American security staff, much of the work is done by local workers. At checkpoints and gates leading to the embassy compound, for instance, Pakistani security guards inspect vehicles and log in visitors.\n\nScandals involving private contractors have dogged the U.S. in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nIn Washington on Friday, the Commission on Wartime Contracting heard testimony about another contractor – ArmorGroup North America – involving alleged illegal and immoral conduct by its guards at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan.\n\nEarlier this year, the Iraqi government refused to grant Xe Services – the new name for what was once Blackwater – an operating license amid continued outrage over a 2007 lethal firefight involving some of its employees in Baghdad, although the State Department has temporarily extended a contract with a Xe subsidiary to protect U.S. diplomats in Iraq.\n\nMany of the recent rumors in Pakistan have been prompted by U.S. plans to expand its embassy space and staff. Among the other unsubstantiated stories the U.S. denies: that 1,000 U.S. Marines will land in the capital, and that Americans will set up a Guantanamo-style prison.\n\nThe U.S. says it needs to add hundreds more staff to allow it to disburse billions of dollars in additional humanitarian and economic aid to Pakistan. The goal is to improve education and other areas, lessening the allure of extremism.\n\nPakistani reporters, anti-U.S. bloggers and others have repeatedly alleged that the U.S. is using Xe, and the issue continues to pop up in major newspapers despite U.S. Embassy denials. Xe Services officials could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday.\n\nThe U.S. has signed a contract worth up to $18.3 million with DynCorp International, another U.S.-based security firm, according to federal records online.\n\nSome analysts say Islamist and other opposition groups may be planting the stories in the Pakistani press and blogs to portray Pakistan''s government as an American lackey.\n\nPakistani political analyst Talat Masood said Inter-Risk''s association with America "will increase the apprehensions that existed that the Americans are engaged in clandestine activities," and that the raid shows "the Pakistan government is asserting itself."\n\nThe U.S. considers stability in Pakistan critical to helping the faltering war effort in neighboring Afghanistan, and has pressed Pakistan to crack down on extremism on its soil. Al-Qaida and Taliban fighters are believed to use Pakistan''s northwestern regions bordering Afghanistan as hide-outs from which to plan attacks on Western troops in Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan has launched offensives against militants, but has also relied on some local militias to help fend off the Pakistani Taliban. Some of these militias share the same aims as the Taliban in Afghanistan, but disagree with targeting the Pakistani government.\n\nOn Saturday, one pro-government militia leader said the army had asked him to stop fighting the Pakistani Taliban. Turkistan Bhitani told The Associated Press that he and 24 aides surrendered their weapons to the army in the northwestern city of Dera Ismail Khan and that he had asked 350 of his men to do so as well.\n\nPakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen.

They were now seeking the company''s owner, a retired Pakistani army captain, the official added. \n\nPolice have denied any connection between the raid on Inter-Risk and the US embassy, but said they were working to protect foreigners living in the Islamabad and increasing vigilance ahead of the Muslim feast which marks the end of Ramadan.

Commanded the General, "I want you to climb to the top of that building and dive off it."\n\n"Sir! Yes, Sir!" barked the Marine who ran off to the building, scaled the outside, and then dove off the building, landed on his head and died.  The Marine General turned to the other officers and said, "Now that''s tough."\n\nThe Navy Admiral wasn''t to be out done, given the hostility on board ships between sailors and marines.

(56117, ' [quote=Dr Zakir]thankyou for sharing your experiences . what do u think 1911 from ed brown and STI  as compared to kimbers[/quote]\n\nThe STI factory is just a couple hours drive north of me.  I would like to visit their factory, but I keep delaying.  STI enjoys a stellar reputation for building great guns.  Their STI Single Stack and Sentinel Premier models are equivilent of the Kimber Supermatch II.  You will see a a lot of STI in competition and I believe that is quiet testimony to the quality and dependability of their products.  Many guys who think 100 rounds is practice, shot slowly so the gun doesn''t get to hot, and the gun is thoroughly cleaned and put back  in the safe may buy Wilson and Les Baer, I just don''t see those same guns being put to the test in competition.  STI''s are- and they run and win.\n\nI can''t offer you much insight in to Ed Brown.  I have some of his after market products.  When a part breaks on my Kimber I replace it with an Ed Brown (if you shoot a lot, you will break parts, it just happens).  I have also broken the Ed Brown parts as well (the extended slide stop about 3 times now- they snag on my short sometimes). I just visited the Ed Brown webpage :wow: them is some pricey guns.  Over $3000 US and the firearm doesn''t have a magwell or ambidextrous safety??  I think I have fired an Ed Brown 1911- the range I work at has a 1911 they rent which I suspect is a well used Ed Brown.  It is nice, but not nice enough to justify the price.  It may be unfair of me to base an opinion of a "rental gun" which has probably been "shot out."', ''),

As per my understanding it can only be transfered to a legal heir (Wife, Child, Grandchild)  The easiest way is to have it done thru an agent.  They will need a copy of the death certificate a copy of the Deceased''s NIC a copy of the NIC of the person who''s name it is to be transfered to and a written request from the next of Kin (In my friends case the requested a letter from his mother stating that her husband had passed away and to please transfer the weapon and license into the name of her Son as he was the Heir).  the total expense for one license/weapon was around 5k.  \n\nIf you have a dealer who you know well and trust then you can ask them to arrange this for you.  I have also heard that another possibility is to place the weapon in the custody of a authorized dealer and then have a fresh license issued and then have the weapon transferred onto the fresh license.  Although this can be problematic when it comes to Rifles because as of now only .22 rifles can be entered onto a fresh license (this is again a grey area because Dealers are allowed to sell other bore weapons and ammo but many times the DCO will refuse to enter the weapon).', ''),

Couple of rounds fired for skeet shooting. May be less than a box of 25. Since I,m good with my Baikal hence I did not practice much on this gun.

Khandaani dushmani or no dushmani ! Remember, the sudden attacker always has an advantage over you, his preparedness! You don''t know it, he knows WHEN! To outbalance this preparedness, you gotta have a chambered, unlocked pistol, yet still the imbalance will be there in that HE has a DRAWN one, you''ve a holstered one! For this you gotta train you drawing technique, otherwise even the chambered and loaded one would be of no use, leave aside the unchambered one, that still has to be cycled!

Note I''ve deliberately excluded the 92fs, knowing well that indeed it is a sharp shooting one. I must say, in order to judge the accuracy of any gun, only most experienced sharpshooters can tell, coz shooting and aiming err with sharpshooters is diminished already, and only the technical factors of the gun makes one gun more precise over the other.

I''ve been to both factories several times and there is a huge difference in the machinery/equipment/techology empolyed between the two factories. NFAC though good is using traditional/typical/desi/old school equipment/skill/technique (akin to Darra made products) whereas DSA is empolying world class technology, (CNC and other high tech machines), imported materials (4140 chrome-moly steel), aircraft grade aluminum and impact resistant polymers (for shotgun furniture).\n\nwhen I was there quiet a while back, I asked a question from both owners. DSA owner (Mr. Nooruddin) replied: we use imported 4140 steel virgin bars for barrel making where NFAC owner Haji Majeed Gul replied: we use the best steel available in the market for our barrels and get it by melting old tyre rods and u know how strong a tyre-rod is. I hope this should explain the quality difference.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s.

(56623, ' AoA Everybody.\n\nfirst of all there is no such thing as grouping in shotguns. grouping is a term exclusively used for single projectile firearms (handguns, rifles). when talking about shotguns the proper term is pattern.\n\nmoving on. Baikal''s patterns are absolutely fine as per standards and i''m absolutely amazed how casually people accuse Baikal''s pattern to be sub standard. I think this "baikal pattern is crap" myth is totally blown out of propotions. remember when somebody (experienced) says Baikal''s patterns are not impressive it means that on the open side of chokes its fine but on the tighter chokes it lack uniformity and density that is desired. all these problems can be easily fixed with aftermarket chokes available through Trulock, Clonial arms and carlson''s chokes. GUESS WHAT, AND DONT TELL THIS TO ANYONE (dont want to hurt the myth spreaders), COME CLOSE! "NOT EVERY BAIKAL SUFFERS FROM THIS ISSUE".\n\nu see, pattern is a tough cookie to crack, too many variables working for and working against the right pattern. even type of shotgun cartridges, load, cartridge length, choke type, barrel length and even the temperature of the barrel can give strange results. I''ve had same type of cartridges give totally different results. i''m sure u get my point.\n\n\nso, coming back to the track. go for a semi auto if u want and Baikal is absolutely fine. a 26inch (most approprite length for ur use) barrel baikal MP153 is as good as it gets in ur budget range. 28 inch will do too, infact I prefer 28 but people find 28inch a bit heavier for patridge hunting. if u want more fancy appearence then Hatsan Escort. but remember with fancier turkish offerings ur basically compromising on durability and reliablity.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(56642, ' I was wondering what has gone wrong with POF 9mm bullet...\nNow many of these bullets sound reloaded. Upon close examination, you''ll see case buldges near case mouths where bullet is seated in.. these buldges are as near to the case mouth as deeply the bullet is seating in. they perfectly seem like reloads.. Wah factory is selling reloads as new ammo? \nPlease check the example: The far left bullet is NIB PKIIZ, 08-batch 9mm.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsFqSlr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nNow some thoughts about DESI AMMO users, as I am one of those less richer dudes who like to fire alot :) \n\nDesi ammo is more specifically a home reloaded ammo produced in small factory like setups not actual ammo factories. They use cases from Spear, Federal, POF, Winchester, Wolf etc. Cast bullet themselves which are made from scrap metal totally useless. Such bullets offer non existant penetration in harder material and they collapse upon impact. Primers used are mostly in 1/10 cases found bogus resulting in dud rounds. That is it.\n\nI have used them alot, because sometimes I like to fire 200 rounds in a session and cant really afford any other ammo on such a scale of use. costing 14rs a round they are fun to shoot, some are over and some are under pressure and that makes them inaccurate and dangerous too.. \nI found out the rounds are not ''crimped'' properly which is bullet reloading process. This is to ensure the bullet fits in the case mouth and seated in to accurate dept using a die. Raloaders could better explain it. \nIn above picture, middle and right, is what you can expect from 1 year old DESI bullets. I barely used my hands with thumb and first finger sqeeze rotation pull out to open up the round...\n\nNOTE: One such round discharged with way less kick and blast, slide too was not able to action the next round, however ejected the spent case. Bullet was then removed from half way middle of the barrel by a push rod.\n\n***Never fire quick succession shots with desi ammo*** also stop firing and inspect your pistol and barrel when an under pressure round is discharged.', ''),

The rifle cocks on closing the bolt and hence our infantry soldiers could reload while the rifle recoiled and fire  immediately after recovering giving it a very high operating rate of fire ( not cyclic ).\nIt was extremely accurate and regular matches were fired at ranges of up to 600 yards,at Jehlum, and even a match used to be fired at 1000 yards , all with its aperture iron sight which had a very  long sight radius.\nIt had a muzzle velocity of 2440 ft/sec with a 175 gr bullet and and 2050 with a 215 gr military bullet.\nIt was adopted in 1888 and retired from service in 1957. It was light,accurate and reliable.\nIt was known as Lee Enfield. The Lee came from the name of James Paris Lee a Scottish born American a fire arms designer and the Enfield  came from the  Royal Small Arms factory at Enfield Lock in England.\nThe sun never set on the British Empire thanks largely to this wonderful rifle. A book can be written on this rifle. A large number of dangerous game was killed because of this rifle and also a large number of british officers and sportsmen of that era were killed by dangerous game due to its inadequacy on large and dangerous game; no fault of the rifle. The hunter should have known better, but this was readily available.\nIt came in a number of models but the favourite will always be Rifle No 4 Mk 1. The Mk 5 came later but was niether as accurate nor well liked. ( I have both )\nTruthfully speaking it had every thing wrong with it when compared with the Mauser but due to soft pressures and hefty leeway in the chamber and throat it worked flawlessly for 75 years for the british and and about 90 years or much more for others.\nIt was the first military rifle I shot in 1964 and later when I joined the army in 1967 I carried it God knows how many thousand miles in soaking rain and like all cadets do I was careful lest I was caught with a dirty Rifle and punished. \nI hated it for carrying it miles and miles and yet I love it so much it is lying in my bedroom ready for inspection by the toughest Weapon Training Sergeant of any acedamy or infantry school.

If these are No.2 POF, the thread is pictorial enough for all members to see visually how they look in reality... some facts to know are:\n- Only one round had ruptured case\n- Rest of 99 rounds are consistent in quality more or less\n- with exception of 2 or 3 rounds I have found to have a micro buldged case\n- I usually inspect each and every round before firing as I like to do it.\n- I have been buying MKIZ and MKIIZ previously from the same dealer @ 30rs @ 32rs and now recently @34rs per round.\n- These micro buldge occurences are probably 2-3 pieces out of 100 and I have certainly noticed them in every batch of POF previously and is to be very honest with the readers. Rupturd Case is one of its kind and have come across it for very first time.\n- *** I request members here to inspect bulk ammo next time and confirm this, either of the presence or absence of micro buldges in the CASES to proove it wrong or right. Though such rounds fire perfectly.\n-The last difference I have found in this batch is the bronze finish of copper jacket, previous batches had golden finish, please confirm to this as well. That is a little of research on this ammo, but will certainly make some nice difference for some one to take benefit from it.

MEANING: WD40 will not stay in ur weapon for long. it will evaporate as the weapon heats up, it will burn and leave carbon/ash which will further gumup ur weapon and will cause it to wear prematurely, something that can easily be eliminated with a speciality firearm lubricant.\n\nif u want to get the best homemade recipe, search the forum for Pakguns cleaner and if u want the best home made lubricant (best not because its homemade) kindly search for Pakguns lubricant.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s.

(56856, ' a_k, \n\nthe type of weapon used by a security guard should be determined by what type of duty he is doing.  for example a personal body guard who is operating in a urban/confined setting would be most effective with a handgun.  \n\nShotguns are typically used because without much training, the user will probably be able to hit targets at close to intermediate range, due to the "spreading" effect of the shot.  However in confined space this could prove dangerous to bystanders.  \n\nI have also seen situations where guards at sniper positions at some of the hotels in Pakistan are armed with shotguns with short barrels.  \n\nThe problem with most Pakistani security companies and their guards is the lack of training and the lack of reliable weapons.  I have seen several security guards with weapons that simply do not work.  \n\nI strongly feel that security companies should be regulated and their training set ups closely monitored.  my recommendation to people and companies using private security companies is to be very particular about the personnel they assign to you with regards to their background, training, etc. and that you insist on regular testing and maintenance of the weapons issued to them.  \n\nSecurity in this day and age is a serious issue and must not be take lightly.  if your paying for a service that you expect will protect your life then by proactive and insist on the best trained people with the best available weapons for your needs.', ''),

(56867, ' i did some digging up on the different types of slugs when i first started with a shotgun. Let me put some accumulated data here. I hope mr 12 bore will be able to derive some information out of this data.\n\nIf i remember it correctly, there are three main categories of slugs, the hollow base ones (foster) the wad stabilized (brenneke) and the sabot slugs.\nthe most accurate of them all are sabot slugs which use a sabot to increase the projectile velocity ( a technique used in armor piercing rounds where increasing the charge and the bore of the projectile s not an option, so the velocity is increased by using a smaller bore sharp penetrating projectile weighing less hence increasing muzzle velocity. This projectile is sealed in the bbl using a sabot ) It has a similar trajectory to other slugs but sabot slugs result in tighter groups and high energy retention / transfer (to the target) properties. One thing that i couldn''t understand was that riffled slugs had muzzle velocity of 1750 fps where sabot ones had 1450 fps avg. This goes against all the standard rules and didnt make any sense to me. May be you guys can shed some light onto it.\n\nPictures of some designs and the remington sabot slug in flight follow.I m sorry i can not list down the source of these images and the information as its been a while and i dont remember which sites i picked up these from :/ kindly excuse the lack of original source. \n\n[b]Remington sabot in flight:[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsuW9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOszVr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsCpA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsEUJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsHoS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsJU0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Brenneke by roteweil[/b]:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsOTi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Federal Sabot:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsRnr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Federal Riffled:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsTSA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Remington Sabot:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsWmJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Hornady XTP:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsOsYRS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nHope this is helpful.

(56905, ' Dear ka_khan sb,thank for liking this thread.Following are some tips which can put some light on how to safe with the animals & insects.\n\nAnimals rarely are as threatening to the survivor as the rest of the environment. \nCommon sense tells the survivor to avoid encounters with lions, bears, and other large or dangerous animals. \nYou should also avoid large grazing animals with horns, hooves, and great weight. \nYour actions may prevent unexpected meetings. Move carefully through their environment. \nDo not attract large predators by leaving food lying around your camp.\n Carefully survey the scene before entering water or forests.\n\n\nWalk carefully and watch where you step. Step onto logs rather than over them before looking and moving on. \n\nLook closely when picking fruit or moving around water. \n\nDo not tease, molest, or harass snakes. Snakes cannot close their eyes. Therefore, you cannot tell if they are asleep. Some snakes, such as mambas, cobras, and bushmasters, will attack aggressively when cornered or guarding a nest. \n\nUse sticks to turn logs and rocks. \n\nWear proper footgear, particularly at night. \n\nCarefully check bedding, shelter, and clothing. \n\nBe calm when you encounter serpents. Snakes cannot hear and \nyou can occasionally surprise them when they are sleeping or sunning. \nNormally, they will flee if given the opportunity. \n\nUse extreme care if you must kill snakes for safety. Although it is not common, warm, sleeping human bodies occasionally attract snakes. \n\n\n\nTicks can carry and transmit diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever common in many parts of the United States. Ticks also transmit the Lyme disease. \n\n[u][b]Mosquitoes[/b][/u]\n\nMosquitoes may carry malaria, dengue, and many other diseases. \n\n[u][b]Flies[/b][/u]\n\nFlies can spread disease from contact with infectious sources. They are causes of sleeping sickness, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery. \n\n[u][b]Fleas[/b][/u]\n\nFleas can transmit plague. \n\n[u][b]Lice[/b][/u]\n\nLice can transmit typhus and relapsing fever. \nThe best way to avoid the complications of insect bites and stings is to keep immunizations (including booster shots) up-to-date, avoid insect-infested areas, use netting and insect repellent, and wear all clothing properly.\n\nIf you get bitten or stung, do not scratch the bite or sting, it might become infected. Inspect your body at least once a day to ensure there are no insects attached to you. If you find ticks attached to your body, cover them with a substance, such as Vaseline, heavy oil, or tree sap, that will cut off their air supply. Without air, the tick releases its hold, and you can remove it. Take care to remove the whole tick. Use tweezers if you have them. Grasp the tick where the mouth parts are attached to the skin. Do not squeeze the tick''s body. Wash your hands after touching the tick. Clean the tick wound daily until healed.', ''),

(56910, ' [u][b]Treatment [/b][/u]\n\n[u][b]Bee and Wasp Stings [/b][/u]\n\nIf stung by a bee, immediately remove the stinger and venom sac, if attached, by scraping with a fingernail or a knife blade. Do not squeeze or grasp the stinger or venom sac, as squeezing will force more venom into the wound. Wash the sting site thoroughly with soap and water to lessen the chance of a secondary infection. \nIf you know or suspect that you are allergic to insect stings, always carry an insect sting kit with you. \nRelieve the itching and discomfort caused by insect bites by applying--\nCold compresses. \nA cooling paste of mud and ashes. \nSap from dandelions. \nCoconut meat. \nCrushed cloves of garlic. \nOnion. \n\n[u][b]Spider Bites and Scorpion Stings [/b][/u]\n\nThe black widow spider is identified by a red hourglass on its abdomen. Only the female bites, and it has a neurotoxic venom. The initial pain is not severe, but severe local pain rapidly develops. The pain gradually spreads over the entire body and settles in the abdomen and legs. Abdominal cramps and progressive nausea, vomiting, and a rash may occur. Weakness, tremors, sweating, and salivation may occur. Anaphylactic reactions can occur. Symptoms begin to regress after several hours and are usually gone in a few days. Threat for shock. Be ready to perform CPR. Clean and dress the bite area to reduce the risk of infection. An antivenin is available. \nThe funnelweb spider is a large brown or gray spider found in Australia. The symptoms and the treatment for its bite are as for the black widow spider. \nThe brown house spider or brown recluse spider is a small, light brown spider identified by a dark brown violin on its back. There is no pain, or so little pain, that usually a victim is not aware of the bite. Within a few hours a painful red area with a mottled cyanotic center appears. Necrosis does not occur in all bites, but usually in 3 to 4 days, a star-shaped, firm area of deep purple discoloration appears at the bite site. The area turns dark and mummified in a week or two. The margins separate and the scab falls off, leaving an open ulcer. Secondary infection and regional swollen lymph glands usually become visible at this stage. The outstanding characteristic of the brown recluse bite is an ulcer that does not heal but persists for weeks or months. In addition to the ulcer, there is often a systemic reaction that is serious and may lead to death. Reactions (fever, chills, joint pain, vomiting, and a generalized rash) occur chiefly in children or debilitated persons. \nTarantulas are large, hairy spiders found mainly in the tropics. Most do not inject venom, but some South American species do. They have large fangs. If bitten, pain and bleeding are certain, and infection is likely. Treat a tarantula bite as for any open wound, and try to prevent infection. If symptoms of poisoning appear, treat as for the bite of the black widow spider. \nScorpions are all poisonous to a greater or lesser degree. There are two different reactions, depending on the species: \n•	Severe local reaction only, with pain and swelling around the area of the sting. Possible prickly sensation around the mouth and a thick-feeling tongue. \n•	Severe systemic reaction, with little or no visible local reaction. Local pain may be present. Systemic reaction includes respiratory difficulties, thick-feeling tongue, body spasms, drooling, gastric distention, double vision, blindness, involuntary rapid movement of the eyeballs, involuntary urination and defecation, and heart failure. Death is rare, occurring mainly in children and adults with high blood pressure or illnesses. \n\n\n[u][b]Snakebites [/b][/u]\n\nSnakebites \nThe chance of a snakebite in a survival situation is rather small, if you are familiar with the various types of snakes and their habitats. However, it could happen and you should know how to treat a snakebite. Deaths from snakebites are rare. More than one-half of the snakebite victims have little or no poisoning, and only about one-quarter develop serious systemic poisoning. However, the chance of a snakebite in a survival situation can affect morale, and failure to take preventive measures or failure to treat a snakebite properly can result in needless tragedy. \nThe primary concern in the treatment of snakebite is to limit the amount of eventual tissue destruction around the bite area. \nA bite wound, regardless of the type of animal that inflicted it, can become infected from bacteria in the animal''s mouth. With nonpoisonous as well as poisonous snakebites, this local infection is responsible for a large part of the residual damage that results. \nSnake venoms not only contain poisons that attack the victim''s central nervous system (neurotoxins) and blood circulation (hemotoxins), but also digestive enzymes (cytotoxins) to aid in digesting their prey. These poisons can cause a very large area of tissue death, leaving a large open wound. This condition could lead to the need for eventual amputation if not treated. \nShock and panic in a person bitten by a snake can also affect the person''s recovery. Excitement, hysteria, and panic can speed up the circulation, causing the body to absorb the toxin quickly. Signs of shock occur within the first 30 minutes after the bite. \nBefore you start treating a snakebite, determine whether the snake was poisonous or nonpoisonous. Bites from a nonpoisonous snake will show rows of teeth. Bites from a poisonous snake may have rows of teeth showing, but will have one or more distinctive puncture marks caused by fang penetration. Symptoms of a poisonous bite may be spontaneous bleeding from the nose and anus, blood in the urine, pain at the site of the bite, and swelling at the site of the bite within a few minutes or up to 2 hours later. \nBreathing difficulty, paralysis, weakness, twitching, and numbness are also signs of neurotoxic venoms. These signs usually appear 1.5 to 2 hours after the bite. \nIf you determine that a poisonous snake bit an individual, take the following steps: \n•	Reassure the victim and keep him still. \n•	Set up for shock and force fluids or give an intravenous (IV). \n•	Remove watches, rings, bracelets, or other constricting items. \n•	Clean the bite area. \n•	Maintain an airway (especially if bitten near the face or neck) and be prepared to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or CPR. \n•	Use a constricting band between the wound and the heart. \n•	Immobilize the site. \n•	Remove the poison as soon as possible by using a mechanical suction device or by squeezing. \nDo not-- \n•	Give the victim alcoholic beverages or tobacco products. \n•	Give morphine or other central nervous system (CNS) depressors. \n•	Make any deep cuts at the bite site. Cutting opens capillaries that in turn open a direct route into the blood stream for venom and infection. \nNote: If medical treatment is over one hour away, make an incision (no longer than 6 millimeters and no deeper than 3 millimeter) over each puncture, cutting just deep enough to enlarge the fang opening, but only through the first or second layer of skin. Place a suction cup over the bite so that you have a good vacuum seal. Suction the bite site 3 to 4 times. Use mouth suction only as a last resort and only if you do not have open sores in your mouth. Spit the envenomed blood out and rinse your mouth with water. This method will draw out 25 to 30 percent of the venom. \n•	Put your hands on your face or rub your eyes, as venom may be on your hands. Venom may cause blindness. \n•	Break open the large blisters that form around the bite site. \nAfter caring for the victim as described above, take the following actions to minimize local effects: \n•	If infection appears, keep the wound open and clean. \n•	Use heat after 24 to 48 hours to help prevent the spread of local infection. Heat also helps to draw out an infection. \n•	Keep the wound covered with a dry, sterile dressing. \n•	Have the victim drink large amounts of fluids until the infection is gone.', ''),

If you wish you can visit Pioneer Arms (the one on mansfield street / lucky star) the owner''s name is Adeel, he will give you a good rate i believe the Norinco CF98 he is asking for 31k and the Intercon one is for 30k.  \n\nI would not expect to get much in terms of cash for your Pak made 30bore.  The legall procedure is first to remove the weapon thru a dealer then get purchasing time (you can do this your self from the home dept or pay a dealer to do it cost is between 500 to 1000) after that the dealer will enter the new weapon onto your license.  \n\nWhile transporting you weapon after purchase the safest thing to do is the weapon should be unloaded with magazines removed, in it''s box also normally the dealer wraps the box in news paper and tapes it as as long as the weapon is in that state the police can not say anything also as mentioned above you will have a receipt that is proof enough that you have just legally purchased the weapon.  \n\nHowever on a side note section 144 is imposed on the display of weapons as long as the weapon is kept in a concealed manner the current section 144 is not applicable.  \n\nAlso for my fellow hunters since the season has begun, when you are going to or returning from a shoot as long as your weapon is licensed, you license is up to date and your hunting weapon is disassemble (bolt removed in case of bolt action rifle) section 144 is not applicable.  please keep these things in mind as our law enforcement officers are often uninformed of the regulations or are looking to intimidate honest citizens just to earn a few quick rupees.', ''),

(56984, ' Hello members,\n\nFirst of all one needs knowledge for safe reloading and a shot shell reloading press. \n\nPlease forgive me “12 gauge” if I were you I would have not tried it, experimenting in developing mould for 12g Slug / velocity. Attaining 3000 ft/lbs in 12g at 50 yards ????,  For argument if you achieve the ME 3000 ft/lbs at 50 yards, I think you are missing the Recoil factor.\n\nLet’s take the example of Remington Buckhammer loads claim the most impressive ballistics of the bunch. The 12 gauge 2 3/4" load has a MV of 1550 fps and ME of 2935 ft. lbs. at Muzzle. The 50 yard figures are 1320 fps and 2177 ft. lbs. its kick like a donkey\n\nThe reason the slugs have so much recoil is simple physics......conservation of momentum: Mass Projectile x Velocity Projectile = Mass Gun x Velocity of Gun.\n\nA 12 ga (28gams= 432grains) slug and a 30.06 both have nearly 3000 ft - lbs of energy at muzzle. \n\nLet''s use the 2.75" 1.25 oz 1550 FPS slugs by Remington ......1.25 oz = 547 Grains! That is three times the weight of a heavy 180 grain 30.06...... And the 1550 FPS velocity is still 57% of the 30.06 at 2700 FPS.\n\nSo a 12 gauge slug and a 30.06 have the same energy.....but in the momentum department, the slug has 547 x 1550 = 848,000 vs 30.06 at 180 x 2700 = 486,000........848,000 / 486,000 = 1.75X.\n\n In your case slug (28g/432g) to Attaining 3000 ft/lbs in 12g at 50 yards , the velocity should be around 2400 FPS plus at muzzle: 432g x 2400FPS=1,036,800= 2.1X\n\nThe slug will give 2.1 times the recoil if the two GUNS are of the SAME weight. So, when you think of high powered slugs.....think of shooting a nearly double barrel 30.06 with both  barrels firing at the same time! enough energy to lift a man.\n\nIll rather stick to the Slug weight than to the velocity. Ill go for tried and tested moulds which can be loaded in our S shells and enjoy shooting.\n\nI would have simply order one of the cheapest moulds available from LEE Precision. 12g 1oz and 7/8oz available just for $27 with hollow base and a KEY DRIVE stabiles the slug. Other option is Lyman, which make hollow base and Sabot slug moulds they cost around $100.\n\nThe difference is Lee moulds are made of aluminum alloy and the other is made of iron. Both works well and fit standard shotgun wads and star crimped.\n\nPLEASE NOTE ANY SLIGHT CHANGE IN AMMO CAN INCREASE THE PREASURE TO DANGERIOUS LEVELS', ''),

(56986, ' What KF has said is agreed upon, however, shotguns are meant for close quarter battle, hence using them for long ranges as anticipated by author of the article does not go by their role. Similarly, using rifles, as suggested by author,  for close quarter battle also does not make sense. In cities a threat is only recognized once it shows up, implying that long range weapons are not effective. Take an example of bank. Thousands of people walk in the bank with no intention written on their face and they are from all walks of life. BGs only show up the weapons once they are inside and a shotgun at that range is deadly for the BGs, provided it is in safe hands. Else another story of collateral damage', ''),

(57032, ' a.	[u][b]Parallax[/b][/u].	Parallax is an apparent displacement or difference of orientation of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. The term is derived from the Greek ?????????? (parallaxis), meaning "alteration". Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances. Parallax also affects optical instruments such as binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields to use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis.', ''),

(57035, ' This is what Wikipedia says about \n\n[u][b]Astigmatism[/b][/u]. Astigmatism  is an optical defect in which vision is blurred due to the inability of the optics of the eye to focus a point object into a sharp focused image on the retina. This may be due to an irregular or toric curvature of the cornea or lens. There are two types of astigmatism: regular and irregular. Irregular astigmatism is often caused by a corneal scar or scattering in the crystalline lens and cannot be corrected by standard spectacle lenses, but can be corrected by contact lenses. Regular astigmatism arising from either the cornea or crystalline lens can be corrected by a toric lens. A toric surface resembles the surface of an American football or a doughnut where there are two regular radii, one smaller than another. This optical shape gives rise to regular astigmatism in the eye. The first spectacle lenses that corrected astigmatism were made in Philadelphia in 1841. The refractive error of the astigmatic eye stems from a difference in degree of curvature refraction of the two different meridians (i.e., the eye has different focal points in different planes.) For example, the image may be clearly focused on the retina in the horizontal (sagittal) plane, but not in front of the retina in the vertical (tangential) plane. Astigmatism causes difficulties in seeing fine detail, and in some cases vertical lines (e.g., walls) may appear to the patient to be tilted. The astigmatic optics of the human eye can often be corrected by spectacles, hard contact lenses or contact lenses that have a compensating optic, cylindrical lens (i.e. a lens that has different radii of curvature in different planes), or refractive surgery\n\nAnd the doctor says about \n\n[u][b] Astigmatism[/b][/u]. Although astigmatism is the most common vision problem, most people don''t know what it is.\n\nAstigmatism may accompany farsightedness or nearsightedness. Usually it is caused by an irregularly shaped cornea (called corneal astigmatism). But sometimes lenticular astigmatism results from an irregularly shaped lens, which is located behind the cornea.\n\nEither kind of astigmatism can usually be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery\n\nAnother simple answer is \n\nAstigmatism means that the cornea is oval like a football instead of spherical like a basketball.  Most astigmatic corneas have two curves – a steeper curve and a flatter curve.  This causes light to focus on more than one point in the eye, resulting in blurred vision at distance or near.  Astigmatism often occurs along with nearsightedness or farsightedness.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://www.postimage.org/TsS4Xdr.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

Sealant preserves a bullet more or less for humidity and water.\nSealants are synthetic polymers or lacquers. They do increase fouling.\nMore then required sealant applied that protrudes the case onto the bullet will definitely affect feeding in pistols with supported chambers and tighter tolerances. They could also result in improper seating of the bullet.', ''),

A businessman in Izhevsk has filed a motion to declare Izhmash Arms bankrupt because of outstanding debts of around 8 million rubles (around €180,000 or $265,000). The case has caused a sensation in Russia because for a long time the Russian armaments industry has been one of the only industries considered competitive on an international basis. And Izhmash, which was founded in 1807 by Russia''s royals, is one of the largest firearms manufacturers in Russia.[/i]\n\n[i]A debt of $265,000!

This situation has arisen as a consequence of a dispute businesses. Right debt requirements this society was through the chain cessions rights from third parties, the validity of which "Izhevsk machine-building plant" is going to find out by contacting law enforcement authorities.[/i]\n\n[i]Note, this is not the first treatment of small company''s creditors in the arbitration bodies, in which, as practice shows, then is not grounds for the organization of the bankruptcy process.[/i]\n\n[i]Which occurs in this case, the dispute between economic entities in no way affect the activities of the group companies Izhmash in particular on the work of the major groups of plants and its subsidiaries. Existing obligations under the state defense order and contracts for the supply of special equipment and civilian goods strictly enforced.

The ones which did fire had normal inundations on the caps. I also fired off about 70 new rounds with no FTF.

Introduced at the latest IWA expo in Nuremberg, Germany, this standard .9x19mm-Parabellum semi-automatic handgun is a prototype coming from a factory called "Daudsons Armoury", known as DSA, and located in Peshawar, Pakistan (see them at: [url]http://www.daudsons.org/);[/url] despite of its location, and the nature of the products displayed on its website, DSA operates with newest, state-of-the-art CNC machineries, and doesn''t manufactures only civilian weapons but it''s also a HUGE Pakistani defense contractor: at the IDEAS 2002 asian defence expo, DSA introduced the "AGL-40", a reliable 40mm automatic, belt-fed grenade launcher that ressembles to a rogue copy of the US-made MK-19 (there''s a picture of the DSA AGL-40 at: [url]http://www.pakdef.info/ideas2002/).[/url] \n\nThe design of this "DSA-9" pistol is evidently ripped off from a notorious Austrian product engineered by a man called Gaston... in fact it is a knock-off from the GLOCK 19. It is a mix of several generations'' Glock models, the trigger guard is different, but the slide will be probably made of metal instead than polymer, at least when the gun will enter production. No other news about this gun are available by now, except that this pistol has already been "coveted" by the Pakistani government as a possible widespread Paki Military/LE service pistol for the near future. \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts10rSL0][img]http://www.postimage.org/Ts10rSL0.jpg[/img][/url][/quote]', ''),

I would advise all members to refrain themselves from trying such a homemade solution. the trick however is pretty neat no doubt.\n\nRegards.', ''),

There is not really much of a difference between:\n\nONLY BOLT ACTION HUNTING RIFLES ALLOWED!!\n\n&\n\n"Rifle Discussions will be limited to only Bolt Action and Double Rifles of any Caliber and Semi Automatic Rifles of .22 Caliber"\n\nWe have kept it short and simple to get the message across without getting into technicalities. The word "Hunting" was put in deliberately to convey the spirit in which we want rifles discussed. So far it''s worked quite well without any confusions. Also since the complete text says:\n\nALL P.B / AUTO WEAPON DISCUSSIONS ARE PERMANENTLY BANNED AT PAKGUNS !! ONLY BOLT ACTION HUNTING RIFLES ALLOWED!!\n\nThat means all P.B (auto''s, rifles etc) are not open for discussion at PakGuns except bolt action rifles commonly used for hunting (regardless of P.B status). .22 is allowed by default as it is not a P.B caliber rather a N.B.P one so it''s not necessary to mention it semi auto or not.  \n\nI also understand that you were trying to tone down the word "Banned" and say the same thing in a nicer manner but with my experience in public dealing in Pakistan any thing that has to be communicated to a large group of people with varying levels of English language proficiency must be easy, short, definitive.  \n\nThanks again for your input, I always encourage discussion about everything PakGuns any and all rules that I have put in place are only for the strengthening and the benefit of the community, if you guys think something can be improved or made better, InshAllah it will.', ''),

(57953, ' [quote=shano shah]Hello members,\n\nFirst of all one needs knowledge for safe reloading and a shot shell reloading press. Pure lead doesn’t work and to convert into alloy has to go under lot of process.\n\nPlease forgive me “PakGuns Expert Panel” if I were you I would have not tried it, experimenting in developing mould for 12g Slug / velocity. Attaining 3000 ft/lbs in 12g at 50 yards ????,  For argument if you achieve the ME 3000 ft/lbs at 50 yards, I think you are missing the Recoil factor.\n\nLet’s take the example of Remington Buckhammer loads claim the most impressive ballistics of the bunch. The 12 gauge 2 3/4" load has a MV of 1550 fps and ME of 2935 ft. lbs. at Muzzle. The 50 yard figures are 1320 fps and 2177 ft. lbs. its kick like a donkey\n\nThe reason the slugs have so much recoil is simple physics......conservation of momentum: Mass Projectile x Velocity Projectile = Mass Gun x Velocity of Gun.\n\nA 12 ga (28gams= 432grains) slug and a 30.06 both have nearly 3000 ft - lbs of energy at muzzle. \n\nLet''s use the 2.75" 1.25 oz 1550 FPS slugs by Remington ......1.25 oz = 547 Grains! That is three times the weight of a heavy 180 grain 30.06...... And the 1550 FPS velocity is still 57% of the 30.06 at 2700 FPS.\n\nSo a 12 gauge slug and a 30.06 have the same energy.....but in the momentum department, the slug has 547 x 1550 = 848,000 vs 30.06 at 180 x 2700 = 486,000........848,000 / 486,000 = 1.75X.\n\n In your case slug (28g/432g) to Attaining 3000 ft/lbs in 12g at 50 yards , the velocity should be around 2400 FPS plus at muzzle: 432g x 2400FPS=1,036,800= 2.1X\n\nThe slug will give 2.1 times the recoil if the two GUNS are of the SAME weight. So, when you think of high powered slugs.....think of shooting a nearly double barrel 30.06 with both  barrels firing at the same time! enough energy to lift a man.\n\nIll rather stick to the Slug weight than to the velocity. Ill go for tried and tested moulds which can be loaded in our Shaheen shells and enjoy shooting.\n\nI would have simply order one of the cheapest moulds available from LEE Precision. 12g 1oz and 7/8oz available just for $27 with hollow base and a KEY DRIVE stabiles the slug. Other option is Lyman, which make hollow base and Sabot slug moulds they cost around $100.\n\nThe difference is Lee moulds are made of aluminum alloy and the other is made of iron. Both works well and fit standard shotgun wads and star crimped.\n\nPLEASE NOTE ANY SLIGHT CHANGE IN AMMO CAN INCREASE THE PREASURE TO DANGERIOUS LEVELS[/quote]\n\nYou have a very valid point. I dont think the desired energy levels are possible without decreasing the weight of the slug substantially (to balance high velocity in the momentum equation and keep the recoil constant), and increasing the muzzle velocity using a sabot design. To add onto that, the design will have to have really good balistics in order to retain the ME at 50 yrds plus.\nAny ways, my point is that the task is difficult nonetheless doable, and yes "trade offs" do and will, always, exist.', ''),

(57967, ' Dear hunters,\n\nBefore going for duck shooting, make it sure you are carrying proper decoys in sizes according to duck species. \nNot many hunters will ditch their old decoys and buy all super-magnums to have a spread. They may replace lost decoys with the oversized decoys a few at a time, but the smaller dikes still have a lot of wear left in them. They''re too valuable to toss.\n\nBut the important thing is to study hunters'' decoy ideas and tactics and see how they relate to your situation. There are effective ways to add motion – judiciously - without going overboard. \n\nThere are times when fine-tuning a spread to a particular species is as simple as adding some wood duck or pintail decoys. Painting a few mallard decoys flat black might increase a spread''s visibility.\n\nToo many hunters just toss out their decoys, hide and start calling. But by fine-tuning a spread, they can add to its realism and bolster its attraction to ducks that most experts agree are becoming increasingly wary.\n\nThe time to be haphazard with decoys is gone. Creativity is now required to fool birds into thinking that your decoys are the real McCoys.\nRemember always repaint your old decoys before any first shoot of your season.\n\nBest regards.\nHunting Masters\n[url=http://www.huntingmasters.com]www.huntingmasters.com[/url]', ''),

Well this is certainly super-sonic. anything roughly above 1200fps is surely super sonic..\nand for accuracy and stability ive always known, that the projectile should either stay sub-sonic or super sonic. the stability thing gets hurt when a projectile is slowed down from super to sub sonic velocities. \nsorry in advance for not being able to help you out in your design, iam not much into shotguns but would love to in future with available resources and time... may be some day.. \nGood luck', ''),

Slug loads intended to be fired from smooth bore barrels manage to combine the worst properties of any hunting projectile: marginal accuracy, low velocity, low sectional density, low ballistic coefficient, rainbow trajectory, and heavy recoil. What a waste!\n\nBy the way to achieve 3000 ft - lbs at 50yards will be probably more difficult with 24grams than for 28grams. I wonder how much propellant you will use to achieve velocity which will delivers ME 3000 ft-lbs at 50yards Have you any idea of SAAMI Shotgun Pressure Specifications?\n\nDo you have a chronograph? Have you chronographed your invention which you test fire? Can you please share the velocity you achieved with the forum ? \n\nPlease note a typical 7.5 pound = 17.3 ft. lbs. shotgun, 1 ounce = 28g of shot at appox. 1290 fps in the same shotgun hits back with around 20.8 ft. lbs. of recoil energy, about like an average .30-06 rifle.\n\nI wonder what you want to achieve from a shot gun. I am sure of one thing you CAN NOT ACHIVE 3000 ft - lbs at 50yards even with 24-25 grams\n\nThe mould I suggested definitely will not give the ME you require.

(58192, ' Salam All,\n Firstly, in the law enforcement community BATF calls this a Straw Purchase - why?  Because the weapon has NOT been in your brother''s possession for over a year meaning its for someone else.  Under Title 18 this is a very serious Federal offence and if my memory serves me correctly, its a minimum ten year sentence at a federal facility according to the federal sentencing guidlines.  Then there is the issue of getting the State Dept. permits.  There is also the issue - is your brother a citizen there or just someone there on a government visit or is he there as a civilian.  The risk is TOO great over the reward.  That gun whatever it is will at most cost about 2000usd.  But if your brother is busted then just so you know.... Richard Gardner, a top firearms federal attorney charges 600usd per hour plus expenses!!!!  I hope you have the money.\nTell your brother to just come home and have a nice flight.  Do not take the risk.  Find a dealer here with an import permit and apply and pay the extra money.  Believe me its the best advise anyone can give you.', ''),

One, which promises to be 35 percent lighter than the standard bullet, has a polymer casing. The other, for all intents and purposes, does not have a casing -- the round is embedded in a high-temperature ignition propellant that, when fired, is vaporized.[/i]\n\n[i]It was last December the company picked up a three-year, $5.8 million contract from the Army''s Joint Service Small Arms Program Office to continue work on its light-weight weapon and ammo. Total funding under the contract could reach $28 million, according to the company.[/i]\n\n[i]The contact calls for AAI to continue work on two types of light-weight ammo -- the cased and caseless rounds the company had on display this week at Modern Day Marine at Quantico.[/i]\n\n\n\n[i]The goal of the Lightweight Small Arms Technologies program is to reduce the weight and size of the small arms and ammo used by Marines and Soldiers.[/i]\n\n[i]"We''ve got a polymer-cased ammunition," said David A. Phillips, vice president for Business Development and Advanced Systems at AAI. "It has a telescoped configuration and uses the same ball propellant as the standard  round."[/i]\n\n\n[i]The round on display constituted about a 35 percent weight reduction from the standard brass-cased round, he said. The caseless round is about 50 percent lighter than the standard round, he said.[/i]\n\n[i]According to another of the AAI officials taking part at Modern Day Marine, Marines who stop by and learn they might eventually be toting ammo that''s up to 50 percent lighter than what they use now have a typical response.[/i]\n\n[i]"Hey, now I can carry more ammo."[/i]', ''),

(58279, ' Hi 12 gauge\n\nI very well know the terms wad, filler shot cups etc. You have not answered any of my queries, any way ill try to answer your question.\n\nFiller and Spacer\n\nOld type wads are pre- plastic type have over- powder and filler wads.\n\nOver- powder wad is Nitro cards are used as a seal between the powder and the shot. Nitro Cards were originally used by black powder shot gunners to seal between the powder and the shot. Today in hand loading they are used as a fine-tuning spacer wad inside the shot cup. They can be added to any modern load where the shot cup is sitting too low for a proper crimp. Nitro cards are replaced by plastic over powder.\n \nThe term filler is a shock absorbing wads connects the disc and cup in the form of pairs  erected on either side of the axis of the shell.\n\nAmmo manufacturers still offer variations of this type of wads.\n\n\nPlastic wads are a single column wad with all the properties three wads. The simple fact the plastic wad one piece unit cup type plastic over-powder wads seals the powder gases much batter than nitro- card wads thus more efficient in powder usages and easy to use and produce the best all- round result. The filler is built in plastic wads, the spring type between over -powder wad and shot cup works as shock absorber.\n \n\nHOW CAN AN EXPERIENCED GUY SUCH AS URSELF CAN FIT A LARGER DIAMETER SLUG IN A SMALLER DIAMETER SHOTCUP BY PLACING \nFILLER WADS UNDER IT.  Do explain. we have a lot to learn from ur experience.\n\nThe fired shell cases available are high base cases they are strong because of thicker base wad and carry low brass heads. Plastic wads available here are of three types. The one is only plastic over- powder and filler wads for SG. The other two wads are for 31g & 24g have 2.2mm difference in total length but main difference between them is in filler and cup size. It''s very simple; I tied to explain in my pervious post 11. The Lee slug fits in skeet wads with slight adjustment and gives perfect star crimp. This mould has absolutely no issues in seating in the wad with a proper reloading press.\n\nI have not casted any other slug but John have reloaded few. A friend came to John with his very old 12 gauge Remington Express slugs, all were misfired. John reloaded them only using 26 grams Remington sabot. They were loaded with old type wads. It was time consuming to use 3 wads, so John  simply took 24grams wads, cut the cup for the shot shell and use the remaining wad (2 cm) as over-powder and filler and end result an excellent star crimp. They were around 43 in total, he was quite happy , since he has used all of them. \n\nWhat about the useless "moulds" with you\n\nRegards.', ''),

(159698, 'CZ 97 b .45 The affordable double stack Handgun; CZ 97B .45 The Affordable Double Stack Handgun; CZ 97 B is a nice piece to have in collection. The single action trigger pull is short, crisp, and fairly light. Double action pull is fair. Sights are of the three dot variety but with irridium night sights. The grips are of checkered walnut. It is very easy to shoot, recoil is no problem, and accuracy is absolutely devastating at short to medium yardage. The 97 has a similar appearance to the smaller 9mm models and shares the superb accuracy potential, but alas, it is way too large for concealed carry but it does have excellent potential as a house defender and car tuck-in gun.

Plastic wads available here are of three types. The one is only plastic over- powder and filler wads for SG. The other two wads are for 31g & 24g have 2.2mm difference in total length but main difference between them is in filler and cup size. It''s very simple; I tied to explain in my pervious post 11. The Lee slug fits in skeet wads with slight adjustment and gives perfect star crimp. This mould has absolutely no issues in seating in the wad with a proper reloading press.[/quote]\n\nwith all due respects sir, gimme news not history. that isnt what i asked for.\n\n[quote=shano shah]\nI have not casted any other slug but I have reloaded few. \n[/quote]\n\nhmmm.... I see.... and the mystery unveils itself\n\n[quote=shano shah]\nA friend came to me with his very old 12 gauge Remington Express slugs, all were misfired. I reloaded them only using 26 grams Remington sabot. They were loaded with old type wads. It was time consuming to use 3 wads, so I simply took 24grams wads, cut the cup for the shot shell and use the remaining wad (2 cm) as over-powder and filler and end result an excellent star crimp. They were around 43 in total, he was quite happy , since he has used all of them. I kept one which is still with me, when you visit Lahore I can show it to you how it is done.\n[/quote]\n\nbro, adusting for length is easy. that is why I never asked how u managed to work around the length. i''m interested in slug OD (the reason why lee and lyman failed). the question still remains: "how in ur infinite wisdom did u manage to get a oversized OD lee slug into an undersized ID shotcup." since u''ve been loading for such a long time, kindly do enlighten me.\n\nlemme try different words, may be i''m unable to make my point clear. how can u fit an oversized slug into an undersized shotcup (shaheen No. 4 or standard shaheen trap). OOPS! same words. i''m sorry. cant think of any at the moment. Ok! how about next time u load some. take a vernier caliper and measure the OD of lee slug then measure the ID of a No. 4 shaheen Shotcup or trap load. then tell me do they fit?\n\nI guess I could just give u the numbers (difference in diameters) but then again u already know them. right?\n\nbro, we can have like a gazillion solutions to a problem however one must stick to his objectives and find a solution around it. thats what i''m doing here. I know I can just order pre-made slugs, I know I can use lee slugs with standard remington or winchester wads. heck! if i try hard enough I can probably find factory slugs 0.689inch diameter (u probably know the reason why this size is important). but whats the fun in that? why not solve the problem with the stuff available at hand? this project is not to prove to anybody else that I can make slugs. or to design a better slug that beats the foreign made slugs.

In case of 31g wad I cut it to a length of 2.2cm with a box cutter. the wads available in shells, the thumb rule is to cut it from where the cup cuts ends.

Industrial strength is only available in fixed packeging and with a price tag of around 2K-3K rupees.\n\n[b]Directions for use:[/b]\n\nfirst clean the barrel of any powder/carbon fouling then wet a piece of cloth with the Pakguns Copper Solvent and run it through the bore, let is sit for five minutes and run a clean piece of cloth through the bore. Repeat if necessary. after cleaning, wash the barrel with tap water to remove any traces of ammonia left in the bore. dry the barrel, remove any traces of water and lubricate with gun oil.\n\nDo give it try, ur barrels will come out nice and clean, as if never used. they say removing copper fouling increases accuracy. not to me, cause i''m a bad shot to begin with. :)\n\n[b]Regards.[/b]', ''),

Of course you need subsonic to take care of the "crack" part..[/quote]\n\n9mm to be super sonic in our local weather requires roughly 1200+ FPS in summers, and 1110+ FPS in winter.\nMost commonly available and used ammo like Norinco Imports, Wolf and American Eagle rounds are all below 1150-eish or so FPS left aside the POF 9mm pIIz ammo.

It features the same design as the Italian-made Beretta Cougars.

Though you have clearly warned to ensure cleaning the barrel from any traces, i feel it is pertinent to point out the dangers of not being careful otherwise someone could ruin a perfectly good weapon by being a little casual with its use. \n\nHope you don''t mind the  warning, its not meant to criticize your efforts but some source for this formula would also be nice to authenticate the formula. \n\nAgain please do not be discouraged or disappointed, its just a concern.\n\nregards', ''),

Change in summer/winter MV being new thing to me & lot of other members needs more explanation, would you please?[/quote]\n\nyes why not, the little i know I would tell Sir but a bit more explanation is appreciated by some of the professionals from this forum.\n\nSir your question indirectly touches a different aspect, subject discussed above rather was Super sonic nature of a bullet and effect of Weather/Temperature on it.\n\nOR we can simply say that; Change of weather/temperature does 2 different things:\n1- Alter the bullet''s Super Sonic threshold\n2- alters Muzzle Velocity/Muzzle Energy\n\n\n1- Alter the bullet''s Super Sonic threshold: Sound has different speeds in different medium. i.e water, air, other material etc. In atmoshpere, speed of sound is affected by the molecular dextarity. Change in temperature changes the molecular movement of air components. Thus change in temperature affects the travelling speed of sound in the air. Also we know that a bullet will be supersonic once it reaches velocity greater than that of sound. Thus different weather/temperatures will either increase or decrease the threshold of super sonic nature of the bullet. The same I have discussed in the above post regarding 9mm''s supersonic nature.\n\n2- alters Muzzle Velocity/Muzzle Energy: Change in Temperature/Weather changes the Interior Ballistics(refers to things going on inside the cartridge/primer). Rise of temperature will increase the flash point and speed of powder burning, as well as increase the same in primer. This will result in rise of pressure inside the cartridge. Thus finally affecting the (MV) and (ME) of a bullet. NOTE: Magnitude of it depends on type of powder being used, nearly all primers and powders are affected however.\n\nAlso for clearing the point, velocity of a standard 9mm round can be increased by putting it up in afternoon Sunlight in mid July for an hour.. BUT...... 9mm is less tolerable to minor changes in terms of interior ballistics(Experts please correct me if Iam wrong)due to case capacity. Therefore any hotter load once heated up in Sun can make excessive pressures resulting in blown out primer or case rupture and even a KB. \n~~~~(Please Never Ever Sunbath your ammunition for the sake of doing it)~~~~', ''),

(58629, ' [quote=Glocky]Dear 12 gauge,\n\nWhile all your past contributions have been without doubt useful and correct. i have a few reservations on using an ammonia based cleaner for gun barrels. Ammonia is known for attacking steel, i agree the concentration is very crucial for this to happen but when buying from a store in loose packaging its still a little risky and doubtful as to the concentrate level. Though you have clearly warned to ensure cleaning the barrel from any traces, i feel it is pertinent to point out the dangers of not being careful otherwise someone could ruin a perfectly good weapon by being a little casual with its use. \n\nHope you don''t mind the  warning, its not meant to criticize your efforts but some source for this formula would also be nice to authenticate the formula. \n\nAgain please do not be discouraged or disappointed, its just a concern.\n\nregards[/quote]\n\nBro, why would I ever mind anything that u say. I totally understand and fully appreciate constructive critisizm. Kindly allow me to clear your concerns.\n\n1. Ammonia doesnt actually attack steel/iron as its PH is too low to cause any harm.\n\n2. Ammonia does however promote rust on metal as it is severely hygroscopic (absorbs moisture), therefore its absolutely necessary to totally remove any residual ammonia solution from the bore. if u read "directions" u''ll see that i''ve insisted on washing the barrel afterwards with running tap water, since ammonia is highly soluble in water (ammonia solution ;) ), washing it with water (even momentarily) will totally remove any traces of it.\n\n3. As far as quoting sources is concerned, Sir its public knowledge/Information and with public knowledge, citing sources is not necessary. how its public knowledge, well......, ammonia is being used to clean copper fouling from barrels for over hundred years. infact if u google it u''ll find many homemade recipes (such as this one but with slight differences) using ammonia solutions in similar concentrations.\n\n4. as far as testing is concerned, kindly contact Dr. Zakir he''ll concur that I tested the solution on his barrel (and many of friends barrels) before posting. infact, a test barrel (7.62 TT) was soaked in straight ammonia solution for more than 10 hours just to see if it causes any harm. only after seeing satisfactory results I posted it here.\n\n5. as far as buying from a lose packing is concerned, remember I insisted on buying from lose packing as 1. lower ammonia content in the ammonia solution 2. only janitor''s ammonia solution is available in lose packing as industrial grade ammonia is very expensive and only available in fixed properly sealed packing of 1-2.5 litres. one more thing: even the janitors ammonia that i''ve used is diluted with liquid dish washing soap.\n\nI hope it addresses any of your concerns. I do however appreciate everyone of them.\n\nRegards.', ''),

The KZ is what happens when you combine the science and technology of Kevlar-reinforced polymer with the art, engineering, and experience of Wilson Combat®. The KZ is setting the standard for polymer-frame pistols in performance, reliability, and accuracy - just like every Wilson. \n\nWe''ve permanently bonded a stainless steel insert with all the critical wear areas - pin holes, feed ramp, frame rails, etc - in a Kevlar-reinforced polymer frame for excellent strength and durability. Wilson Combat’s® design gives you two rounds more than a standard 1911 with a grip that is actually narrower, and an empty weight of only 34 ounces for full-size - the kind of benefit you want in a carry pistol, on the range, or in a tactical situation. And since it''s a Wilson Combat® firearm, we custom build it for you the way you order it: Tactical Combat sights or adjustable sights, single side Tactical safety or ambidextrous safety, full size or compact, even a light mount. The standard features are what you expect from Wilson - a precision fitted and installed stainless steel barrel, extended tactical thumb safety, our High-Ride beavertail grip safety, and Wilson Combat Tactical sight system with tritium inserts. And the best standard feature of any firearm in the world - Wilson Combat''s® maximum satisfaction lifetime promise of unparalleled customer service. \n\nA top shooter recently visited Wilson Combat and had his first experience with the KZ. "Build me one of these in a .40, and I can campaign with it," he told us. The KZ delivers that kind of confidence - and isn''t that what firearms are supposed to do?\n\n Whether you''re looking for your first Wilson, or your next Wilson - the KZ may well be the best value in our line of weapons.

(58768, ' If you want to judge with some degree of certainty how a particular bullet will perform on game within a certain velocity range, the surest method is to test it yourself.\n\nHandgun hunters who use specialty pistols such as Thompson/Center''s Encore and Contender often must use bullets designed for velocities outside the range of those generated by handguns of these types. Cartridges designed for revolvers produce higher velocities in the closed breeches and longer barrels of these specialty pistols, and bullets must be selected carefully to ensure that they do not come apart on impact at these higher velocities. \n \nThe author tested these Barnes TSX 6.8mm bullets in wet newspapers at various velocities to determine maximum effective range on deer-size game. The TSX is an excellent bullet at rifle velocities, but as it turned out it was not the best choice for the slower velocities of the 6.8mm SPC in a handgun.\n\nBy contrast, even the 14- and 15-inch barrels in use now with the T/C handguns produce considerably less velocities with rifle cartridges than the bullets may have been designed for, and care must be taken to ensure that the bullets will expand properly, especially at longer ranges.\n\nWhile there is a plethora of information and terminal test data available on self-defense handgun loads, little is offered on handgun hunting loads. Some bullet manufacturers offer basic information on expansion characteristics and optimum velocities, but if you want to judge with some degree of certainty how a particular bullet will perform on game within a certain velocity range, the surest method is to test it yourself.\n\nLow-Cost Bullet Testing\nBallistic gelatin is used by experts in both the private and government sectors to test and compare bullet expansion and penetration. Gelatin is fairly expensive, though, and it''s time-consuming to use correctly. The handgun hunter can fare quite well with less expensive and easier methods. \n\nWe do not need to meet exact scientific standards. The goal of the handgun hunter is simply to compare various bullets and determine within a reasonable margin of error which best suits his needs. All we truly need to know is whether the bullet will expand at the impact velocities likely to occur and how well it will remain intact and penetrate at these velocities.\n\nThere are two simple and time-honored methods for testing bullets in your backyard or at the range. One is to test in water, using containers of some type lined up in a row of sufficient length to stop the bullet. I use one-gallon milk and water jugs that I save as they are emptied. The other method is to soak newspapers in water until they are thoroughly saturated. While neither method will always tell you exactly how a bullet will perform in flesh, both will allow you to compare one bullet to another and set some standards of performance that, with experience, will allow you to predict a bullet''s performance on game with a fair degree of accuracy.\n\nTest at impact velocities\nSome backyard ballisticians only test at near muzzle velocity. This is a mistake. To accurately guesstimate how a bullet will perform downrange it must be tested at downrange velocities. This can be done by setting up the tests downrange and firing at various distances--easy enough if you have a couple-hundred-yard range in your backyard, but it can be a hassle at a public range.\n\nI prefer to down-load ammo to match downrange velocities. I set up a chronograph in front of the test medium and record velocities and document recovered bullet samples as I reduce the load in increments until I have tested from muzzle velocity to an impact velocity matching the longest distance I am likely to shoot. Any ballistic software program can be used to calculate downrange velocities. (A note of caution: When reducing loads drastically, be sure a suitable powder is used that is safe for reduced loads.\n\nA concern when using bottleneck rifle cartridges in handguns is that velocities can be fairly low even a couple of hundred yards downrange. Some rifle bullets only expand completely above 2,100 fps. When you start the bullet out at short barrel velocities of perhaps 2,400 to 2,600 fps, the bullet doesn''t have to travel far to drop below velocities required for optimum expansion. This is why lighter rifle bullets with thinner jackets often work best at handgun velocities.\n\nEvaluating the results\nTesting bullets in any substance is not an exact science. Water, wet newspapers and gelatin offer consistent resistance throughout the bullet''s path. Animals do not. But you can learn a lot from testing if you know what to look for. \n\nBasically, you are looking for three things. Does the bullet expand completely? Does it retain weight and penetrate sufficiently? And at what point does expansion occur?\n\nJudging expansion is easy. Either the bullet expands or it doesn''t. You can measure the expanded bullet with calipers, and if expansion is twice the bullet diameter, smile and be happy. You can also weigh the expanded bullet and determine the amount of retained weight. As much as high weight retention is touted by some, I have found that some weight loss is not only acceptable but desirable for certain game. \n\nWith medium game such as whitetail deer, handgun bullets that expand rapidly and shed some weight just seem to kill quicker in my experience. You still need enough retained weight to penetrate reliably, but do not get hung up on searching for 95 to 100 percent weight retention. High weight retention is, of course, desirable on larger, tougher game to ensure deep penetration.\n\nYou can judge how quickly and at what point a bullet expands by looking at the wound channel in wet newspapers. You can judge this to a lesser degree in water jugs. I number the jugs and then examine each after shooting. The jug with the most damage is where the most expansion occurred. This is usually the first jug, but it may be the second or third if the bullet is designed for slower expansion. You can also look at entry and exit holes on each jug and get a good idea of how much the expanded bullet diameter was at those points.\n\nJudging whether the bullet provides enough penetration is the most difficult aspect of testing. Here is where a control bullet is most useful. If you have a bullet that has performed well for you on the game, fire it into the test medium at various downrange velocities and use it as a benchmark upon which to judge other bullets.\n\nThe ultimate test of any bullet is how it performs on game. The main advantage of testing bullets before you go hunting is to eliminate bullets that are clearly not suited to the task. If a bullet will not expand in water jugs or wet newspaper at a given velocity, it likely will not expand in game at that velocity. Likewise, if the bullet breaks apart in these substances it will almost surely break up on game, especially if bone is hit.\n\nTesting your bullets is easy and a lot of fun and could prevent a lost wounded animal. If you test a variety of bullets on an ongoing basis you will gain experience as to how various bullets perform and will become more adept at judging a bullet''s potential based on these tests.', ''),

(59070, ' @TT-33.... The +p or for that sake ++p rounds in any caliber means ammunition with higher loads for increased power. When a  bulletcase has more gunpowder loaded, it gives the projectile more power which gives higher velocity, and with higher velocity, higher energy! Thus, it would outdo a target much quicker than standard ammo. The more p''s the more power. However, bear in mind that not ALL guns can handle the increased gas pressure within the chamber! In normal guns, the increased power would lead to a quicker wear n tear, at times after consistent shooting and say after a few thousand rounds, all depending upon your care of your gun, may necessitate parts replacement, i.e recoil springs, etc. Additionally, your gun may jam occasionally. Also, remember controlling ability of the gun, whilst using +p ammo is adversely affected due to higher recoil! One must practice further to make shot placement better with this ammo. In my opinion, this is a defensive round, and if you''ve a gun that can handle it, only use it for SD, after practicing a few mags to get used to the recoil and judge your shot placement. I would not suggest it for routine practice/range shooting. Additionally, I would say, if your gun is not +p ammo specified, better go for the JHP ammo for SD, if you need increased power. Though JHP does NOT offer more pressure than standard ammo, it''s "flowering" feature leads to greater internal damage and thus more stopping power! I would however add, that in my opinion, our local P.O.F 9mm rounds have, to some extent, a + p factor added to them, if not the ordinary one, then at least the one for sten-guns that they produce, owing to which many users often feel jams with their guns, be it due to FTE or FTF! Note the markings on P.O.F ammo, they are separate for both, yet people often use the wrong one in Handguns! Hope my two cents helped a bit!', ''),

Why do you think he did this?[/quote]\n\nwhat do u mean by "when measured". you dont have to measure it, its written on the box and manual.\n\n26inch is a good length, its light and nimble and fast on the birds therefore highly recommended by experienced hunters for bird (flush) hunting. but then again its all about preference, I use 28inch length for everything. the unwritten rule is that 26 inch for bird hunting and 28inch for sports shooting and waterfowl hunting. but i''ve seen guys using 28inch length pretty efficiently for almost everything. it all boils down to personal preference.\n\n\nGeneral Trend in Barrel Sizes: (just trends doesnt mean its some kinda rule).\n\n26inch = most appropriate for bird hunting with a gun dog, here a quick mount and quick followup is required.\n\n28inch = jack of all type of barrel length, can do both efficiently both sorta like "master for none" type approach.\n\n30inch = most appropriate for waterfowl/duck hunting, offers longer sight plane, makes shots more accurate and offers superb swing. now u know why sports shooters are increasingly turning to longer barrels.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(59157, ' Hello,\n\nI am a new member to your forum, but not new to gunmetal.\n\nI visited Mr. Azhar Bandukwala of M/s Lotia and Sons on M.A.Jinnah Road. I wanted to apply for my NPBs. He asked for about the average market price, and I paid him full advance.\n\nAbout two months later, I inquired. Nothing. I kept inquiring, and instead of giving me a real status, it was one Topi after another. What bothered me the most was the continuous, perpetual and circular lies that these people call business.\n\nWhat would have been more appropriate was him telling me that licences are closed. He never did. He kept saying next week. Then stopped picking up the phone, or answering emails or phone. Pathetic and unprofessional.\n\nI usually respect elders unconditionally, but his father sitting on the same desk was no different.\n\nDuring this time, I also asked to see weapons that he may have. Most of them were used, diesel serviced, local blued, oil washed weapons. I acted aloof to see how far he will stretch to screw his customer. A taurus with 500 rounds he says has only fired one clip, a Zastava recond (re-blued) he says is new.\n\nHe is also the Sarasilmazz agent supposedly. Hence, he tries to push it all the time. Kindly be careful on what you buy. Usually, when you ask them, when is the consignment coming, its one or two days, or tomorrow. Other than that, most of the pistols he showed me looked pretty, chromed barrels, machined receivers, BUT, look at the barrel thickness, look at the finish of megazines. Real poor in my opinion. I will stick with Taurus Brazil (Tore Ass to some) over the Turkish crap anytime. Stoeger is the only exception, where I have visited the factory, and know what materials they use. \n\nAs for my revenge, and I went to his shop and I told him what he is worth on his face. I believe not many are this confrontational, but I just cannot put up with liars and cheats.\n\nOverall, Lotia and specifically Azhar Bandukwala is a specific no no. Don''t fall for the hats, notice that these people don''t or are unable to make eye contact with you. They take special enjoyment in screwing anyone who is not from their community.\n\nI would rather pay 10 dollars more to someone who will be honest, then save 10 cents with them.\n\nOnly my two cents.\n\nCheers.', ''),

It''s ok for a beginner like my brother who in a month''s time is now able to hit 7/10 times in one inch hole from 20 yards = 60 feet.\n\nI have a park just opposite my house which remains closed most parts of the day and I happen to have the gate''s spare key. Two week''s back using the Tasco Scope I was able to hit the lamp post at approximately 45 yards = 135 feet 4/5 times. Using magnum pro pellet, I ''accidently'' broke the glass of the lamp post at 20 yards. My bad.\n\nHowever, my personal experience (which I really find surprising) is that both mine and my brother''s accuracy at 20 yards with Gamo Match Pellets (using scope) is 90%, while with the Gamo Magnum Pro it''s around 50% - 60%. What about other air gunners? What''s your experience.\n\nFor it''s dirt cheap price and for young beginners, the scope gets a 7/10 from me. \n\nAs for pic, please see above.', ''),

(59361, ' @Shano Shah, definitely Mr 12Gauge will answer your questions but i have heard from someone credible that you are an old reloader. \n\nSir isn''t it that simple, Kinetic energy is the function of bullet weight and the velocity. If we want to get a certain terminal energy say 3000 lb/ft with a projectile of 24grm at 50m the only variable at our hand that we can play with is velocity. This velocity can easily be calculated. Now peoblem will be to measure the exact ammount of suitable powder to acheive that velocity for a 24grm projectile. The only tricky part could be the chamber pressure if the charge is too much.\n\nSo, will the gun be able to handle that charge??? :|\n\nAnother thing can also be tricky, we increase projectile weight by say 10% the recoil of the gun increases by 20% similerly we increase velocity by 10% again recoil increases by 20%. Remedy, increase the weight of the gun by 10% but recoil decreases by only 10%. :) \n\nRegards.', ''),

(59507, ' @Salahuddin Ayubi, \n\nPhysics states that two bodies, may it be a feather and brick, if left from a building (taking height as a constant) will accelerate at the same rate to the ground and reach the ground at exactly the same moment in time; However this is only true if we ignore air resistance. Now think about the verticle component of velocity of both bullets. imagine they are both fired from a point say, 45degrees to the horizontal... It is common sense then that the heavier slug (here the magnum) will be accelerated more towards the ground due to gravity. Thus meaning that the projectile drops to the ground significantly earlier than the light magnum. (resulting in less range).\n\nPutting an end to the physics lesson:P, I would suggest that you adjust the rear sight elevator so that when you use the magnum, You aim a little above the target at hand, (Taking into account the range that you think the projectile needs to cover before hitting the target.) \n\nHope this was of help to you.\n\nRegards', ''),

There is one problem in it, He said my Pakistani TT (which I bought in October 2008 fired only 13 shots) does not have any worth and they will take it as ammanat if they find someone to sale it they will let me know. He further said if you buy any local made product even in 20000 in return you won''t get it anything. Pakistani products do not have any worth.

You can check for the same at "Pyramid Air". Secondly one of my friends and I (serious airgunners for the last 40 years), just werent able to control the recoil and as a result could not take advantage of its power beyond 20 yards. I sold it to someone and replaced it with Diana 54 Air King, which is recoil less and absolutely the most accurate air rifle that I have ever used. It has the same price and power range.

Now think about the verticle component of velocity of both bullets. imagine they are both fired from a point say, 45degrees to the horizontal... It is common sense then that the heavier slug (here the magnum) will be accelerated more towards the ground due to gravity. Thus meaning that the projectile drops to the ground significantly earlier than the light magnum. (resulting in less range).\n\nPutting an end to the physics lesson:P, I would suggest that you adjust the rear sight elevator so that when you use the magnum, You aim a little above the target at hand, (Taking into account the range that you think the projectile needs to cover before hitting the target.) \n\nHope this was of help to you.\n\nRegards[/quote]\n\nThat''s why I chose commerce/finance and went on to become a CA.

(59854, ' [b] How to Become a Better Husband, Boyfriend or Life Partner[/b]\n \nThis article is not particularly insightful. Nor is it all that authoritative. I am not claiming to be the world’s best husband – far from it. But one thing I can attest to is that I am always trying to be better for my lady. I never forget that our relationship is something that needs to grow and change and be worked on. \nIn this post I am going to tell you all the most important things I know about being a good husband, boyfriend or life partner. Some of these I figured out myself, others I learned by trying to do the opposite of what my father did. \n\n[b]The role that always changes[/b]\n\nThe first thing that you need to know if you want to be a good husband is that things change. Your partner changes, you change, your life situation changes. And because these changes take place without warning you constantly need to evolve as a man and as a partner. If you aren’t willing to change who you are (or think you are) then you are going to run into trouble in your relationship.\n\nThat being said, being a good husband is not about bending to your wife’s every whim. Not at all. In fact, she wouldn’t like it if you did that. A good woman will always want you to be true to yourself and to do what makes you happy. But she will expect you to change when change is required, and rightly so. \nThe reason I wrote “become” instead of “be” in the title is because this is a role that is always changing. The job is never finished. The good husband, boyfriend or life partner will always see that there is work to be done on his relationship and his self. Please take this to heart.\n \n[b]How to become a better husband, boyfriend or life partner[/b]\n\nI would like to share some tips with you now in the hope that they will impact your relationship in some positive way. Sadly I have not had that many great male role models in my life so my idea of what a husband should or should not do is something that is constantly changing. If anyone out there knows better than me or has some insight into what a husband really is I would love to read your comments. \n\n[b]1. Learn to listen, but not just to her words[/b]\n\nOne of the best things my life partner has taught me (indirectly) is that a man needs to listen to a woman on many levels, not just her speech. By the time she has to tell you to do something you have often already missed several hints that she has been giving you. If you want to be a good husband you need to learn what these hints are. \nTake the dishes as a really simple example. My mother used to cook dinner ever single night for my father, my brother and me and every single night my father would “forget” to help with the dishes. Now my mother never asked him to help because she knew he was tired from work but she quietly would have loved him to offer his help as thanks for a lovely meal. After dinner she would always be grumpy. On the odd occasion that dad did help with the dishes she would be a different woman; happy engaging and gentle. \nBeing a good husband means listening, not just to her words, but to her more quiet signals. Every woman is different and communicates in different ways and as her best friend it is your job to figure them out.\n \n[b]2. Suggest and create excellent communication habits[/b]\n\nAfter reading the first point you might be thinking, “why can’t she just tell me what she wants?” That is fine. If you have spent a lot of time talking to your wife and creating a relationship where she can openly ask you to do something without feeling like she is nagging then that is excellent. Wait for her to tell you. Mostly, however, your wife will say she shouldn’t HAVE to ask you, you should just do it. This is where communication comes in.\n \nBecoming a good husband means creating excellent communication habits. Sometimes this is hard. Sometimes in the heat of anger you won’t want to communicate. But a good husband tries to. A good husband will find out why you have got to the point of getting angry and create a solution. Let’s look at an example, again borrowed from my father and mother. \nSay you go out on Thursday night with your friends for a beer after work. Your wife is at home cooking dinner and as such it would be nice if you got home by 7.30pm to eat together. But it doesn’t always work out like that and sometimes you don’t get home until late. When you get home you wonder why she is grumpy and you ask her things like, “what’s wrong?” and “did you have a bad day?” which only makes things worse. At the end you give up, yell at her and go to bed. \nNo solution. \n\nA better way to do things is to use your brain and find out what is eating at her. Does it happen every Thursday? Yes. Well then perhaps it has something to do with the beers after work. Okay, now we are getting somewhere. Next you should sit her down on a nice Sunday afternoon and ask her whether you had upset her by being late for dinner. If she says “yes” then apologize and then promise to communicate with her better the next time (i.e. phoning if you are going to be late). Also, gently suggest that she be more open with her feelings because you would never intentionally upset her. \nOpening the communication and creating good communication habits will save your marriage. Be creative. Don’t say “what’s wrong woman” and expect her to tell you and then be cool with it. Take some responsibility and create a solution. If my father did this I imagine their relationship would have worked out a lot differently. This has a lot to do with how much he respected my mother. \n\n[b]3. Don’t lose your sense of individuality[/b]\n\nThis is not something that you ever get told by your parents but it is something that is so important I had to write about it. Don’t lose your sense of individuality. Don’t become one of those couples that merges into one. A marriage is not a melding of two people; it is two individuals coming together. If you lose that individuality you lose something special. \nQuite often I see people get together and then give up their hobbies, past times and interests because they are all absorbed in their partner. Within a few months or years the relationship is over (or in chaos) because they are bored with each other. They gave up their individuality. \nThere is a quote in Buddhism that says, “If you spend enough time with a person you will see only their faults. Even if you were with the Buddha himself you would find something not to like“. This happens in relationships when you give up your individuality and just live as if you were one person. Remember, when you first met each other you had other things going on (reading, sports, music, poetry, friends, etc.) and this is partly why you were attracted to each other. So why give them up? \nSometimes it is hard to keep your hobbies and past times going because work is so full on and you hardly get to see each other but you must try. You must make a concerted effort to spend time apart every week and do something for yourselves. You will be much happier as a couple if you do. \n\n[b]4. Never hit, swear at or yell at your wife[/b]\n\nIt might seem obvious to some people but other people seem to miss the memo. It is never okay to hit, swear at or yell at your wife. If you get to a point where you find that yelling is the only answer then you have made a mistake somewhere along the line and need to go back and fix it up. \n\nSometimes I go out with my mates and talk about our partners and wives. Inevitably one of them will bring up “fights with the missus” and talk about how sometimes you need to yell at your wife to assert your authority. My internal reaction to this is always “no you don’t”. She is not a dog that needs to be trained by showing your dominance. She is your life partner, your best friend and your lover. Hitting, swearing and yelling are forms of degradation and not fit for this person. \nFor all the men out there who think that yelling is necessary I understand where you are coming from. I know the place you are in, I have been there. But I would like to offer you a quote that has stood by me through thick and thin with my lady. This quote was offered to me by my yogi friend when we were discussing marriage back in India.\n\n“The real measure of a man is by how quickly he gets angry.”\nYou will not show your dominance by yelling at your wife. All you will show her is that you have a weak will and a low level of patience. Then man she would really respect is the one that can stand up for himself without resorting to bullying. The real man is one who can keep his calm in battle, sport and love. Please think about this. \n\n[b]5. Show creative leadership[/b]\n\nNow before you start sending me nasty emails, I do not not think that the male is the leader in the relationship. I am well aware that men and women are equals and have always thought this to be the case. One thing I have learned, however, is that your partner will love you all the more (and find you more attractive) when you can show creative leadership in the relationship. Let’s look at an example. \n\nYou have both had a big day, just arrived home and are pretty hungry for dinner. But there is nothing in the pantry. Quite often you will both sit around umming and ahhhing and thinking about what to have. Should we get take away or should be be good and cook? However, instead of sitting around and wondering, a creative leader would make an assertive decision and then get it done. No fuss. No mucking around. Just action. \n\nScientifically speaking women are programmed to like this behavior as it shows strength and survival skills. But more than that is takes away a layer of stress. If you can show some creative leadership when she isn’t feeling at her best she will really appreciate the input. It might be dishes, a conversation over dinner, the color of the new paint or a solution for a problem she is having. Once you start doing this for her you will notice how often she has been doing it for you!\n\n[b]6. Love her, but not just with words[/b]\n\nA big theme in this post is that you must be a husband in more than just words. Words are empty if they are no backed up with meaning and action. The same is true of love. You could tell her that you love her 1000 times a day but it means absolutely zero if you then turn around and ignore her. \nA good husband will find new ways to love his wife. He will listen to her stories, ask her about her day, value her input in the house and in your life and always make sure she feels that appreciation. Tell her how much you admire her actions and who she is becoming as a woman. But don’t do it if you do mean it; make sure the words have meaning. If you can find a way to connect the words with an action that shows you are serious she will love you forever. \n\n[b]7. Don’t beg for sex, create the moment[/b]\n\nA real man will never have sex with his wife when she doesn’t want to. Unfortunately, sex is such a big part of a relationship if problems start to occur the relationship can get a bit rocky. One piece of advice that I can give you is that a good sexual partner creates the circumstances for enjoyable sex, he never asks or begs for it. If she isn’t into it then you need to be patient.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nBeing a good husband, boyfriend or life partner is something that is constantly evolving. You cannot just sit back, do nothing and hope for it all to work out for the best. Try to love her with more than just words, be creative and create some really clear communication habits. And never hit her. Ever.', ''),

(59864, ' [b]A different view[/b]\nWhile many believe that ideas belong to an owner, Richard Gallagher, author of "How to Tell Anyone Anything: Breakthrough Techniques for Handling Difficult Conversations at Work," has a different perspective:\n \n"There is a misguided belief that ideas, and credit, should be hoarded as a kind of career currency," Gallagher says. "In reality, ideas flourish when fertilized by the input of an entire team. People who worry too much about idea ownership are often putting self-interest ahead of the good of the entire workplace, an attitude that can hurt your career." \nIn other words, Gallagher thinks that ideas are not copyrighted and cannot be stolen, only spread. By encouraging people to spread your ideas, Gallagher says you gain more leadership credentials than by squabbling over credit. \n\n[b]Advice and tips[/b]\nHere are five ways you can deal with or prevent idea appropriation (or idea sharing):\n\n[b]1. Create advocates for your idea[/b]\n"Too often, when we think of a great idea, we turn to the person closest to us and share it. Instead, get strategic," McClarie says. "Ask yourself who in your organization is seen and valued as a leader and needs to know about [your ideas]. You''re getting your idea out there before it can be stolen and you''re also making it clear that it''s your idea." \n\n[b]2. Reframe your views[/b]\n"Change your perspective from one of having your idea stolen to one of having it communicated," Gallagher says. "Congratulate the other person for doing such a great job of communicating the idea and tell your boss what a great job this person did of helping bring your idea to life." \n\n[b]3. Ask others for support[/b]\n"Ask others to speak to [your] idea at an anticipated meeting, particularly if you think there might be some pushback," McClarie says. That way, people will refer to the idea as yours. "''Well, (idea-stealer), that''s an interesting point; Charmaine and I were speaking about this last week.'' At that point, the idea has been unstolen." \n\n[b]4. Think beyond the idea[/b]\n"Over a century ago, someone had the idea of turning a horse carriage into an automobile. Do you remember who that person was? The people we really remember are the ones who took ideas and built on them," Gallagher says. \n\n[b]5. Borrow, encourage and give credit[/b]\n"When you openly encourage people to ''steal'' your ideas and get in the habit of ''stealing'' from others and crediting them, wonderful things happen to your career that you could never imagine when you try to be the lone ranger with a great idea," Gallagher says.', ''),

(59867, ' Three universal goals most of us share are: to live longer, to live free of illness and to control our weight. Interesting enough, normal walking lets us achieve all three. In fact, walking may be man''s best medicine for slowing the aging process. First, it works almost every muscle in the body, improving circulation to the joints and massaging the blood vessels (keeping them more elastic). Walking also helps us maintain both our muscle mass and metabolism as we age. It also keeps us young in spirit. For anyone out of shape or unathletically inclined, walking is the no-stress, no-sweat answer to lifelong conditioning.\nAll it takes is a little time, common sense and a few guidelines. Unfortunately, there''s a lot of misinformation floating around regarding fitness walking, weight-loss and dieting. Walking is one of the best exercise for strengthening bones, controlling weight, toning the leg muscles, maintaining good posture and improving positive self-concept. People who diet without exercising often get fatter with time. Although your weight may initially drop while dieting, such weight loss consists mostly of water and muscle. When the weight returns, it comes back as fat. To avoid getting fatter over time, increase your metabolism by exercising daily.\n\nTo lose weight, it''s more important to walk for time than speed. Walking at a moderate pace yields longer workouts with less soreness - - leading to more miles and more calories spent on a regular basis.\nHigh-intensity walks on alternate days help condition one''s system. But in a waking, weight-loss program, it''s better to be active every day. This doesn''t require walking an hour every day. The key is leading an active life-style 365 days a year.\nWhen it comes to good health and weight loss, exercise and diet are interrelated. Exercising without maintaining a balanced diet is no more beneficial than dieting while remaining inactive.\n\nThe national research council recommends eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Fruits and vegetables are the ideal diet foods for several reasons. They''re relatively low in fat and calories, yet are often high in fiber and rich in essential vitamins and minerals. Remember that rapid weight-loss consists mostly of water and muscle - - the wrong kind of weight to lose. To avoid this, set more reasonable goals, such as one pound per week.\n\nCarbohydrates are high-octane fuel. They provide energy for movement and help raise internal body metabolism. They''re also satisfying. The key is not adding high-fat toppings to your carbohydrates.\n\nIt''s everyday habits which define our weight and body composition. A three-minute walk after each meal is worth four pounds less body fat annually. Two flights of stairs a day burns off half a pound of body fat in a year. On the other hand, one candy bar eaten daily will cost you 20 pounds annually.', ''),

Mashallah, you were on the buck and seems you have a very good foresight.\n\nI purchased my first 24 karat 10gm gold piece when I was 23 in the year 2001 for Rs. 6,242/-. Since then I''ve made it a point to purchase gold as soon as my cash savings are enough. On rare occasions I''ve liquidated a part of my gold holding and diversified in equities and foreign currencies in the past but only when I had reliable and concrete information, but that too only for a very short term period (not more than 6 months). After realizing the gain, I once again convert the cash into gold.\n\nFor a married guy like me, there is another plus in saving in gold. You can impress your wife also with a gold bangle / carra on different occasions without having to take out cash from your pocket. The gold simply gets converted from biscuit form to ring or bangle form with minimal banwai (making) loss as is the case with necklaces, etc.\n\n\n[b]For other members:[/b]\n\nJust to give you guyz an idea of appreciation in gold price between today and 2000.

In business, you may hear someone say, "He drank the Kool-Aid," when  he means, "He has been thoroughly trained in the program and we have his unconditional support," or "He is on board with our strategy." In political commentary, it is used to imply that people who disagree with you have been brainwashed or are under the influence of drugs.\n\n[b] Going native[/b]  \nDefinition: This is what happens when a consultant stops acting like a consultant and starts thinking he is part of the client organization. If you aren''t willing to go somewhere else, go ahead and apply for a permanent job. You aren''t providing the same value you were in the beginning.\n\n[b] Greenfield instance[/b]  \nDefinition: Clean, new installation of an application without customizations, configuration or data. When a brand-new application is installed, it is a "greenfield instance" until the consultants and programmers go in and start messing it up with configurations and code changes.\n\n[b] Holistic[/b]  \nDefinition: A big-picture view or a solution that includes upstream and downstream impacts. Whatever it means, it''s a great consulting word and we use it a lot.\n\n[b] Paradigm[/b]  \nDefinition: The perspective or view you have of a situation. For example, "When ownership of our order fulfillment project moved from operations to sales, it caused a paradigm shift that resulted in a whole new project strategy and approach."\n\n[b] Running in parallel[/b]  \nDefinition: Processing normal operating data through two systems simultaneously to compare performance and output. When a client is feeling particularly paranoid about a new system that his consultants have developed or implemented, even after exhaustive testing and training, we will sometimes recommend running the new system in parallel with the old for a short period.\n\n[b] Straw man[/b] \nDefinition: First draft of a solution or proposal intended to provoke discussion. It is an object, document, person or argument that temporarily stands in for and is intended to be "knocked down" by something more substantial.\n\n[b] Talking to the dog[/b] \n \nDefinition: Thinking it through by talking it through out loud. You''ll often hear engineers and programmers say that they finally solved a problem by talking to the dog.\n\n[b] Use case [/b] \nDefinition: A particular circumstance or situation in which the solution would be used. For example, when designing a system, the engineer will refer to all the use cases that have been documented to determine if his solution would be effective in each situation.\n\n[b] White paper[/b]  \nDefinition: An authoritative report or guide published to share technical or business information, particularly related to solving common problems.

I credit them to the following:\n\n1- Repetition leads to a certain amount of muscle memory\n2- both times the technique was similar (not the same) as in the videos: Quick misdirection of the threat and immediate violent counter attack.\n\nDisarming techniques or defense against deadly weapons always require a narrow set of circumstances.  They require the weapon to be presented in certain ways at a certain distance.  And, now they won''t always work as expected, but how well they might work might.\n\nWe can''t expect the counter to be devasting.  We also can''t expect that the attack we experience will incapacitate- the guy with the club actually hit me first from behind.  It didn''t knock me out, it did hurt and raise a bump. Mindset is important.\n\nI don''t see a reason to totally dismiss the technique.  I see how it could work.  I see that part of it might require significant repetition.

DSA product line is powder coated whereas that monstrosity had enamel paint all over it, enamel paint yar. need I say more?\n6. one of the pieces which they showed us had bent front bead. OK I understand its a prototype but then again some say (apparently not DSA people i''m afraid) that a prototype reflects final product.\n7. it was heavy as a tree trunk, unbalanced, extremely nose heavy and my first thought was WOW! THIS HEAVY WITH SHORT BARREL, CANT IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT WOULD WEIGH WITH A LONGER BARREL.\n8. color cased trigger and bolt on a semi auto: what is that, darra humor?\n\nnow as far actual performance is concerned, I couldnt, simply couldnt. cause I''ve seen far better quality darra made clones.\n\nI''ve talked to Mr. Nooruddin on the phone and as always he is a thorough gentleman and immediately apologized for it. He said that he has been preoccupied with his family lately (the disappearence of his brother Mr. Hakimuddin) and did not give attention to this project. He asked for 10 more days as his brother is back with them and everybody is sorta busy there. \n\nso hopefully I will post a review in detail once I get to operate a better and more refined piece.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Appreciate the effort.\n\nActually, last evening I tested Shadow at 60 yards and like I mentioned in my post in another topic, I had to make an adjustment of 16-18 inches by aiming that much over the target (a six by 18 inch wood piece) to keep hitting it 70%+ times. I was using Pro-Magnum pellets.\n\nI reckon that is the max where you can properly aim and achieve results with Shadow. I also understand that the average fps one gets from a .22 shadow is around 700fps.\n\nTherefore, I thought if there was a .22 with around 980fps, I could get around 40% more power and range out of it. Maybe go near 100yds.\n\nOr maybe I should instead get myself a .22LR like Abu Al Hawl had planned, which is actually the reason why I bought the Shadow in the first place. To get my aim right from 25 yards to 50 to 75 to 100 yards and then ultimately switch to a real rifle. Just learnt that on Sindh license one can have any calliber in bolt action, which was really pleasing to hear.\n\nThe final aim is to become capable of accurately shooting upto 300 yards, ofcourse, with due guidance from Skeeters.', ''),

The strike appeared to be a warning to the military that its planned offensive on the insurgents'' stronghold along the Afghan border would be met with attacks against targets across Pakistan.\n\nThe government said the assault on the headquarters, which followed a bloody market bombing and a suicide blast at a U.N. aid agency in the past week, had strengthened its resolve to push into South Waziristan — a mountainous region home to al-Qaida leaders where security forces have been beaten back by insurgents before.\n\nThe spasm of violence was confirmation that the militants had regrouped despite recent military operations against their forces and the killing of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in a CIA drone attack in August. His replacement vowed just last week to step up attacks around the country and repel any push into Waziristan.\n\nArmy spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said "four or five" assailants were holding between 10 and 15 troops hostage in a building close to the main gates of the complex in Rawalpindi, a city near the capital, Islamabad. No senior military or intelligence officials were among those being held, he said.\n\nAbbas said special forces had surrounded the building. "They will decide how and when to act," he said, declining to comment on whether authorities had attempted to talk to the hostage takers or whether they had made any demands.\n\nNo group claimed responsibility, but authorities were sure that the Pakistani Taliban or an allied Islamist militant group were behind it.\n\nLate Saturday, sporadic gunfire was heard coming from the complex.\n\nIn its brazenness and sophistication, the assault resembled attacks in March in the eastern city of Lahore by teams of militants against the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team and a police training center, which the insurgents took over for 12 hours before security forces retook it.\n\nSaturday''s attack began shortly before noon when the gunmen, dressed in camouflage military uniforms and wielding assault rifles and grenades, drove in a white van up to the army compound and opened fire, Abbas and a witness said.\n\n"There was fierce firing, and then there was a blast," said Khan Bahadur, a shuttle van driver who was standing outside the gate of the compound. "Soldiers were running here and there," he said. "The firing continued for about a half-hour. There was smoke everywhere. Then there was a break, and then firing again."\n\nAfter a 45-minute gunfight, four of the attackers were killed, said Abbas.\n\nHe initially told the Geo television news channel that the assault was over and the situation "under full control."\n\nBut more than an hour later, gunshots rang out from the headquarters compound, and Abbas then confirmed that other gunmen had eluded security forces and slipped into the compound. The city is filled with security checkpoints and police roadblocks.\n\n"We are trying to finish it (the siege) at the earliest, clear the area of terrorists and restore complete control," Abbas said.\n\nAbbas said six soldiers were killed, included a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel, and five wounded, one critically.\n\nPakistani media said the Taliban had claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nA police intelligence report in July obtained by the Associated Press on Saturday warned that members of the Taliban along with Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group based in the country''s Punjab province, were planning to attack army headquarters after disguising themselves as soldiers. The report was given to the AP by an official in the home affairs ministry in Punjab''s home department. \n\nOfficials said Saturday they had raided a house in the capital where the attackers were believed to have stayed. They found military uniforms and bomb-making equipment. \n\nThe United States has been pushing Pakistan to take strong action against insurgents using its soil as a base for attacks in Afghanistan. The army has previously been unwilling to go into Waziristan with significant force, but has likely been emboldened by its successes against the militants in the Swat Valley earlier this year and the killing of Baitullah Mehsud. \n\n"I want to give a message to the Taliban that what we did with you in Swat, we will do the same to you there (in Waziristan), too," said Interior Minister Rehman Malik. "We are going to come heavy on you." \n\nMilitants regularly attack army bases across the country and bombed a checkpoint outside the army compound in Rawalpindi two years ago — one of several major bombings to hit the garrison city in recent years. But rarely have the Taliban mounted an armed assault in the city involving multiple fighters. \n\nSaturday''s siege followed a car bombing that killed 49 on Friday in the northwestern city of Peshawar and the bombing of a U.N. aid agency Monday that killed five in Islamabad. The attacks showed the militants are capable of striking a range of targets across the country. \n\nThe man who attacked the U.N. office was also wearing a security forces'' uniform and was granted entry to the compound after asking to use the bathroom. \n\nIslamist militants have been carrying out nearly weekly attacks in Pakistan, but the sheer scale of Friday''s bombing in Peshawar — which killed nine children — pushed the government to declare it would take the fight to the lawless tribal belt along the border where al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden may be hiding. \n\nAny operation in Waziristan will be very difficult. Militants are believed to have 10,000 well-armed fighters there, and winter will arrive in one month''s time and could bog down troops. The army must also ensure that insurgents do not regroup elsewhere in the northwest, including Swat. \n[/quote]', ''),

Two seperate incidents.\n\n1- Two guys at a gas-station late at night.  I was much younger... wow, that was some 15 years ago... anyways.  I was joking around with a female friend, and two guys drove up, heard part of the combination and decided to make trouble.  They got out of the car and one pulled a bat.  I didn''t see the other was armed with a shorter wooden club.  I was focused on the guy with the bat when the guy with club got behind me and hit me.  I was moving so it was galncing blow but it still hurt.  I turned and grabbed the club then I realized I had turned my back on a guy with a bat so I spun the gun around putting him between me and the guy with the bat.  Then punched him knocking him down.  The guy with the bat and I exchanged words but he wasn''t committed to the fight.  Which was lucky for me since I should have lost the engagement being outnumbered and under-armed.\n\n2- I was on the Sheriff''s department when I guy pulled a knife and stabbed at me under-handed. All I could and did do was grab his wrist and again punched him repeatedly until he was down.  I don''t think he was very good with the knife.

In the end i asked the guy to show me there 9mm handgun. They have made few pieces which are given to there guard for security purposes. Well they gave it to me....... It design was same as that of a glock... not exactly but 75%. The frame was polymer. It was striker fire like the glock. Square shaped slide like the glock. The pistol grip was very comfortable for a person like me having big palms. There were holes for night sights but werent there as this was not the production model......... They told me that two south african engineers were recruited to make this design. They also told me that there pistol underwent test and trial in some foreign country and came out to be successful. The reason they tested it  outside pakistan was to assure the other country about its quality because they are intending to export it.\n\nWhen i  asked them about its production, they told me that they were delaying it because of Hakim-ud-din who was kidnapped but now he is recovered and they are planning (according to the guys in the factory) to launch it in a month or two. The design and testing is complete, only to program the machines for a production line.......  Didnt have camera at that time otherwise i would have taken the pics.

(60712, ' [b]Please note: This review just discusses about the brands mentioned and it doesn’t say that these are the only realiable or quality brands producing guns. This is just my personal opinion about these particular brands. I still love and depend on some other brands as well & which are not included in this review.[/b]\n\n\n@Sensei\n\nAs per your list of Brands and just one choice, let''s assume that I don''t have any other brand as yet and one I have to choose then I will pick as following:\n\nFor CG (Carry Gun) Glock 17 with out any hesitation & \nFor CC (Conceal Carry) Glock 19\n\nReason being why I choose Glock is that I hv personnaly seen and have been breiefed by one of my friends who works for Glock. I M more than satisfied by it''s performance and the built quality (Barrel, Slide, frame, mags and all internal parts) that Glock can go for thousand & thousands of rounds without any problem plus :\n\n1: Simple Safe Action.\n2: Easy to Maintain as per cleaning is concerned.\n3: Realizable & Accurate\n4: Manageable weight with loaded mags\n5: Great Grip Ergonomics\n\n \nFor me it''s like having more than one child and to decide which one U love the most. Of course it could happen that one loves his one kid more than the others but still he loves the other more than his own life including the one he loves the most.\n\nFor me the list of brands (kids) is as follows and I would like to use any one of these any time of the day, week, month or the year. But Glock will be my "Laadla & Caheeta". But I will not let him spoil my love for others. :)\n\n1: Glock\n2: HK\n3: Sig\n4: Beretta\n5: Colt\n\nSerial No. for the above mentioned brands does not represent the quality or top brand. They all produce great guns. Again the preference is the key only as some time one would like to have striker fired gun, some time hammer fired, some time U wana have the feelings of a steel gun an so on. All these brands produce realizable and quality guns.  So it''s just the preference and mood at the time.', ''),

The civilian 308 in Bolt action is a NPB and so is the civilian .222 remington or the .223 remington. The military specs are 5.45x39 mm (and there is a sepaate debate on another thread on this as regards to its incorrect classification as a 222) and the 5.56 (and the 223 has reduced pressure!) \n\nthe 303 that my dad had  he had the barrel leaded and gave as a present to a frined of his. I some times think how silly.\n\n@skeeter60: abba is actually headed to lhr tonight-driving down i think. Hope he runs into you cos i think he is planning to meet up with Brig Saeed and Ayaz Amir in Isld.\n\n@mig: sir the 303 is no longer in use by any military service in eiher service rifles or the MG equivalent. Its an obsolete military round. Even the NCC has phased it out in pakistan (not that i did my NCC) Some Police Stations in rural Punjab had the 303''s a few yrs back and so did LHR Police-phased out i think. The Indian Police has 303''s a fact that was painfully highlighted in the Mumbai attacks and even the assesment there was that it woefully old and obsolete. They still had 303''s as left overs from the Indian Army and old rifles due to budget constraints. So your information is actually a bit incorrect. As far as the 223 is concerned its use is for the AR-15 version as the M-4 or 16 is chambered for the 5.56 mlty round. You ca fire a 223 round from it but firing a 5.56 in a AR-15 or a bolt actio will produce gases in excess of what the rifle is designed for!', ''),

(60804, ' [quote=KageFox]I myself have used the term several times, but I''d like a pro to define [i]combat accuracy[/i].\n\nThink about combat accuracy in two different scenarios: a SWAT team operator on a hostage rescue mission, and a civilian defending his home from thugs, both armed with handguns.\n\nThe SWAT operator will be required to shoot very accurately, in order to avoid collateral damage, and will possibly need to take headshots, maybe from outside the normal CQB range. For the home defender, center mass shots will be more than enough. Now, the combat accuracy required for both these cases is quite different. IMHO, the SWAT guy needs quite a bit more accuracy than the civilian, though both are in a state of combat.\n\nIt may have been a pointless rant, but the question, once again, is: how does one define [i]combat accuracy[/i]?[/quote]\n\nKage Fox has asked a great question.\n\nI am not a pro, but I have an opinion/observation.\n\nCombat accuracy used to mean a rifle which fired 4 MOA or less.  For nations fielding an infantry man he need a rifle that would group shots within 4" at 100 yards.  It had nothing to do with the shooters ability, only the rifle''s accuracy.  A sniper rifle had to better 1 MOA for comparison.\n\nHandguns also had a level of acceptable accuracy, which was something like 3" at 25 yrds.  For a rifle the equivilent would be 12 MOA.  Again, this is soley the guns accuracy, nothing to do with the shooter.\n\nHowever, when handgun fighting came into vogue, the term combat accuracy appeared to morph into a something refering to the shooter being able to shoot X number of shots in Y seconds in a group no more than Z inches at A distance.  One writer on a gun blog defined it as 5 shots in 5 seconds in 5 inches at 5 feet.\n\nSome definitions are not quite so precise, such as: "Any hit on the adversary that effects change in the adversary in regards to the OODA loop." Which is how Roger Phillips of Suarez International defined it.\n\nOne large US based shooting school defines it along the line of draw and hit the thorasic cavity with two shots in 1.5 seconds at 5 yards.  I think they define the area as an 8" circle.\n\nI tend to think 5" is too small and 5 seconds too slow when the threat is only 5 feet away.  I also think any shot which makes the threat stop to think a bit too esoteric.  I advocate speed w/o misses over all else.  \n\nA 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper cover''s vital organs on almost every man when held over his upper center cest, portrait like.  If you are hitting that, you are both hurting (likely lethally) and mentally affecting the threat.  The time?  I dunno, as fast as you can?  What distance, no idea either.  \n\nThe biggest problem is that defining combat accuracy as it has morphed into refers to a shooters ability and not the firearms ability and the time demand must be fluid in consort with the distance.  As the distance increases the time requirement must increase.\n\nMaybe the solution is to stop using the term, "combat accuracy" since that officially refers to a inherit mechanical accuracy and coin a more accurate term for a shooters ability to survive a deadly threat.  Combat Handgun Ability Objectively Scored (CHAOS)???', ''),

(60812, ' [quote=Dr Hanif Malik][quote=StevenCline][quote=AK47]Hello Brothers, I like to know from some of you who have shot with different types of handguns at the range, that which of these pistols have you found as being the most accurate one: 1) Glock 17/19, 2) SW Sigma 9mm, Stoeger Cougar 9mm, Taurus PT 909. Note I''ve deliberately excluded the 92fs, knowing well that indeed it is a sharp shooting one. I must say, in order to judge the accuracy of any gun, only most experienced sharpshooters can tell, coz shooting and aiming err with sharpshooters is diminished already, and only the technical factors of the gun makes one gun more precise over the other. Perhaps, Abbas could narrate a bit about these, as I guess he must have used all of them. Plz confine yourself to these models, as I have to add one of these, apart from the Cougar, which I already have, to my humble collection. Thanks.[/quote]\n\nI have shot the Glock 17 and 19, and the Sigma 9mm.  Of the those two, the Glocks were more accurate than the S&W.  The DAO Sigma was unpleasant (my opinion).\n\nPlease don''t underestimate the importance of a good trigger on the gun.  It doesn''t have to be super short and super light.  But if it is long, heavy and gritty, it tends to affect your accuracy.[/quote]\nyes i agree with your coments please can you tell me turkish or any other cheaper witch can be used in compition .[/quote]\n\nI am not familiar with Turkish guns.

(60865, ' This is True Story. Please read this without fail. It is a lesson for all who have contempt / scorn for others. \n \nA NICE ONE !!\nOnce upon a time in China , a girl named Li-Li got married & went to live with her husband and mother-in-law. \nIn a very short time, Li-Li found that she couldn''t get along with her mother-in-law at all. Their personalities were very different, and Li-Li was angered by many of her mother-in-law'' s habits. In addition, she criticized Li-Li constantly. \nDays passed, and weeks passed. Li-Li and her mother-in-law never stopped arguing and fighting. But what made the situation even worse was that, \naccording to ancient Chinese tradition, Li-Li had to bow to her mother-in-law and obey her every wish. All the anger and unhappiness in the house was causing Li-Li''s poor husband great distress.\n\nFinally, Li-Li could not stand her mother-in-law'' s bad temper and dictatorship any longer, and she decided to do something about it. Li-Li went to see her father''s good friend, Mr. Huang, who sold herbs. She told him the situation and asked if he would give her some poison so that she could solve the problem once and for all.\n\nMr. Huang thought for awhile, and finally said, "Li-iL, I will help you solve your problem, but you must listen to me and obey what I tell you."\n\nLi-Li said,"Yes, Mr. Huang, I will do whatever you tell me to do. "Mr. Huang went into the back room, and returned in a few minutes with a package of herbs. He told Li-Li, "You can''t use a quick-acting poison to get rid of your mother-in-law, because that would cause people to become suspicious. Therefore, I have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body. Every other day prepare some delicious meal and put a little of these herbs in her serving. Now, in order to make sure that nobody suspect you, when she dies, you must be very careful to act very friendly towards her. "Don''t argue with her, obey her every wish, and treat her like a queen." Li-Li was so happy. She thanked Mr. Huang and hurried home to start her plot of murdering her mother-in-law. \nWeeks went by, and months went by, and every other day, Li-Li served the specially treated food to her mother-in-law. She remembered what Mr. Huang had said about avoiding suspicion, so she controlled her temper, obeyed her mother-in-law, and treated her like her own mother.\n\nAfter six months had passed, the whole household had changed. Li-Li had practiced controlling her temper so much that she found that she almost \nnever got mad or upset. She hadn''t had an argument with her mother-in-law in six months because she now seemed much kinder and easier to get along with.\n\nThe mother-in-law'' s attitude toward Li-Li changed, and she began to love Li-Li like her own daughter. She kept telling friends and relatives that Li-Li was the best daughter-in- law one could ever find. Li-Li and her mother-in-law were now treating each other like a real mother and daughter. Li-Li''s husband was very happy to see what was happening. \nOne day, Li-Li came to see Mr. Huang and asked for his help again She said, "Dear Mr. Huang, please help me to keep off the poison from killing my mother-in-law. She''s changed into such a nice woman, and I love her like my own mother. I do not want her to die because of the poison I gave her."\n\nMr. Huang smiled and nodded his head. "Li-Li, there''s nothing to worry about. I never gave you any poison. The herbs I gave you were vitamins to\nimprove her health. The only poison was in your mind and your attitude toward her, but that has been all washed away by the love which you gave to her."\n\nHAVE YOU REALIZED that how you treat others is exactly how they will treat you? There is a wise Chinese saying: "The person who loves others will also be loved in return." God might be trying to work in another person''s life through you. \n\nSend this to your friends and spread the POWER OF LOVE.\n\nRemember, if you delete this mail nothing will happen. No one will die or fall sick. But... if you tell this True Story  to others you may change their life. \nAfter all you have got nothing to lose but a lot to gain. "A candle loses nothing if it is used to light another one .', ''),

As I told U about my friend working for Glock. I asked him the same question. He replied that Glock''s research there is a good reason for using a plastic guide rod. When the gun is fired the guide rod comes under a great pressure while recycling as the barrel moves a bit to reward while the slide goes all the way back and is pushed back to complete the recycle process on the strength of the guide rod and the spring. In this process the guide rod while being seen on a microscopic video camera indicates that the guide rod almost half bends over. With the passage of time metal fatigue factor can bring more wear & tear. While Plastic guide rod has more flexibility and tendency to bear this recycling stress/fatigue and it performs well under extreme pressure during recycling process.\n\nAs I told my friend that I got after market Steel guide rod with spring and I am intended to u use this instead of Glock Factory plastic guide rod. Don’t do that, he said if u wana use it just for a change then its fine but he recommended me not to do so as Glock has it''s research and if they are not opting for a steel guide rod then there is a reason behind it. He also gave me the insight to the Glock Barrels, they are die hard strong and can take thousands & thousands of rounds. \n\nGlock pistol is being dropped from the aircrafts from high altitudes during their torture tests and they performed well. Steel or aluminum frame guns tend to get too hot during their torture test but polymer frames like Glock keeps on firing without burning the hands of the shooter. \n\nMy preference and love for Glock is for a reason and after my detailed discussion with my friend and my research from different sources including internet.', ''),

I haven''t studied the paragraphs, so I got no legal grounding to say anything specific, but my common sense says that you can only respond in such cases as circumstances compel you! This means, shoot only to kill if absolutely necessary. This is when the robber is armed himself and could shoot you fatally. Otherwise, shoot to injure only, still only if he is armed. If he is not armed, air-fire to shock and have him pacified, cornered, caught and handed over. Even in cases of robbery where firearms have been involved by the defender, forensic investigations do follow, and it would not be a pleasant situation whatsoever that they reveal the BG only had a knife, an iron bar or other kind of minor hardware on him and he was shot to death by you! Some form of legal complications will follow, I''m not quite sure about your above 100% rights to shoot within your premises. Perhaps, a lawyer member, if any, could come forth and elaborate.', ''),

(60958, ' Gentlemen, \n\nI have posted this topic as robbers were at a famliy members house. No gun was pulled and no one was hurt. However this could have been the case. Your replies suggest that there are two thoughts on this one is to shoot and kill no matter what and the second is to take reasonable action under the law. \n\nGod forbid the robber was in our house how would we react. Keeping in view what the current robbers did lets look at this again. They took some cash and mobile phones. They did not hurt any one (they could have, but did not).\n\nSo the question again is do we put a bullet in someones head for stealing. Being the robbers lawyer i guess he would argue that the house owner used undue force as the robber was not armed. And for petty theft the owner shot him dead. Which is second degree murder. \n\nFrom a religous point of view an eye for an eye so if the robber does not harm you and you shoot him then that is excessive force. \n\nWhat does that law say. Mr. Basharat has shed some light on that. The bottom line is that there may be legal implications inclusive of jail time to shoot just anyone who enters our house. I too would like to take that emotional decision thinking how dare someone invade my privacy and enter my house where my wife/childen/parents live, but what decision should i take as a responsible citizen? Are there any lawyers/policemen here who can share their views. And have some of you changed your views or not???\n\nWhatever your decision is I would like to hear it. But it should be backed by law. It should be a responsible decision rather than an emotional one.\n\nLastly, as per law the burden of proof will be on you to show that the robber was there not only to steal but also to cause bodly harm', ''),

Its ricochet when compared to Gamo Pro Magnum is less. Gamo Pro Magnum on the other hand ricochets a bit more but it is LETHAL during hunting for example lizards and rats. For example if we hit a lizard with Gamo Match it shall be thrown at a distance but it still manages to move around, therefore a finishing shot is called for. While with a Gamo Pro Magnum the first shot is all that is required, it is amazing to note that Pro Magnum is as accurate as Match in an air rifle. For indoor use go for Match for outdoor use go for Pro Magnum. If your air rifle is not powerful enough to take down a dove in one shot don''t bother shooting birds as they will manage to fly away each time. Causing them discomfort is not good.

(61222, ' @ALL. I would like to know, from some of those members who have regular interaction with the MOI, say i.e Dr. Zakir Sahib, or any other of our senior members, if there is any CONCRETE PROCEDURE one could follow to have the Originality /Veracity of one''s licenses checked and confirmed from the MOI? Especially, the P.B ones, coz fake-hood in these involve more serious consequences than traditional section 13/20/65 of PPC! Now, I know that one could go to the relevant department in MOI and have the records checked for correct data entries, yet I don''t find that sufficient enough somehow, coz if any one from the relevant section in MOI has been involved in fake issuances, he may well have covered himself up with the entries by one way or another. Best would be, if a fresh CERTIFICATION LETTER could be issued to the holder, duly signed by the most senior officer of the department, confirming the genuinty and proper data entries in the record, so that one at least has a proof that on receiving the license one did the effort of going to that relevant dept. for the check. That at least would be some kind of defense for the holder, even IF the license was a fake one, never mind it was registered with the post office and later presented in the office of D.C.O too. They don''t check the background on making entries in their record. Hope to hear from you in this regards, coz these days new agents pop up everywhere, MOI issues licenses in ABUNDANCE as compared to few years back, and many a scandals have already struck the MOI recently. In this era of brute terrorism, it wouldn''t be a nice situation to be put behind bars or into inquiries for possessing UNAUTHORIZED WEAPONS, just because one trusted the agent, and confidently moved around with arms, be it PB or NPB!

(61248, ' Gentlemen, \n\nI have created quite a stir here. Which was my aim!!! All your comments are respected. I will try to answer them by playing the devils advocate. \n\nPersonally I would also like to shoot an intruder but lets look at it closely. Do we think there would be no legal implications for shooting a thief (in Pakistan if you are simply witness to a crime, you are treated as the suspect, unfortunate but true, thus this is more serious case). \n\nWe shoot the thief to death and his lawyer claims that his client robbed 10-20-50-X number of homes and hurt no one. He should have been punished for robbing and not punished by death. \n\nI will aim to answer all your posts to see if we are only ruled by emotion or reason as well. Please also note that my goal is to secure some answers backed by law so that should a situation arise we know that we are protected under the law. \n\nLets start with ay_be_why \n\nThe lawyer’s point of view would really help. Topak are you there? Some have been known to get people scot free. Does any one remember the OJ Simpson case!!!!\n\n@MHMalik\n\nThanks for the information I will search for self/ home defense threads as well.\n\n@Basharat\n\nIn our quest for what to do with a robber I came to know the difference between a ‘choar and dakku’. The first just wants to rob and the second robs with intent to hurt/kill etc. \n\nComing to your comment and only playing the devils advocate. Do you think there will be no repercussions of shooting a thief? (In our relatives case we just found out that 4 houses were robbed and no one was hurt. The thief was there just to get cash and mobiles the common denominator in all 4 houses). So let’s assume that this terrible petty thief who has robbed 3 houses without hurting anyone and now comes to yours and you shoot him. Where do you stand in the court of law? Topak what is your view? \n\nYour suggestion about a guard dog is a good one! Most people who own a gun and are on this forum I assume are not squeamish about using guns. But we should also do the right thing so that we are protected under law. \n\n@AK47\nFirst of all congratulations on becoming the LORD OF WAR. Interesting title. Reminds me of the Last Samurai. I am sure you have seen the movie if not it is a must watch keeping in view the movies theme which revolves around the modernization of weapons, tradition and society in ancient Japan. You have nailed this one. I am interesting in the legal reputations/formalities. The mistake is mine, I should have titled this post ‘Do you shoot and thief and what are our rights under law in all intruder shooting scenarios.” \n\nBy the way I too am not squeamish but would like to do the right thing as a responsible citizen of the country. \n\n@KageFox\n\nI would generally agree with your statement supposing all other things remain constant. \n\n@CougarMan\n\nI would agree with keeping a dog as I personally like them. But there are 2 issues here. Dogs need to be trained only to eat from the master ( and that is an issue if you are a frequent traveler) and not take food from strangers. I lost a dog like this as a kid. Our dog was poisoned. Secondly some people may not be comfortable with a dog in their house due to religious reasons. \n\n@Conceal Carry\n\nNice nick. On a totally different note I have a topic on Smallest guns. If you have any ankle carry suggestions I would love to hear them. \n\nComing to your answer I agree with you that both Islamic and state law allow you to defend your life and our family and loved ones. But the thief who has robbed you and did not hurt you and your family (should he be shot or not) What will the law do here. \n\nI also agree that a thief will carry some sort of weapon lets say a knife but a thief aims to steal and use it only if confronted. His aim is to get money and valuables and leave. Normally he would not like to kill you unless you confront him or if he has a personal grudge with you in which case you have every right to shoot him. Because then you are in your right to shoot him as he has taken the law into his own hands and came with intent to KILL and not to steal. \n\n@KageFox, \n\nAgreed the thief is not there to have tea but he might be there to take cash without harming you unless required/confronted etc. And yes can take him down, in which case a tranquilizer gun comes to mind. But do we shoot him to death?\n\n@Sensei, \nYes if he intends to harm your family we shoot him and we are protected. But in this case we should be able to demonstrate to the court without a shadow of doubt that the intent was to harm your family. Personal vendetta etc. \n\n@A55kika,\nYes but how would the law look at this. Shooting on instincts alone…\n\n@pkjunaidb\nIn one word only INTERESTING. What if you are asleep and robbed and the thief is about to escape without hurting you do you still shoot him to death. In the head and chest thereafter and groan as a member has explained earlier?????\n\nGentlemen, I look forward to your comments and reasons.

(61272, ' [quote=shahsaeen]My use of both the pellet types has allowed me to make the following observations. Gamo Match is an excellent pellet for use on paper targets and sighting in an air rifle. Its ricochet when compared to Gamo Pro Magnum is less. Gamo Pro Magnum on the other hand ricochets a bit more but it is LETHAL during hunting for example lizards and rats. For example if we hit a lizard with Gamo Match it shall be thrown at a distance but it still manages to move around, therefore a finishing shot is called for. While with a Gamo Pro Magnum the first shot is all that is required, it is amazing to note that Pro Magnum is as accurate as Match in an air rifle. For indoor use go for Match for outdoor use go for Pro Magnum. If your air rifle is not powerful enough to take down a dove in one shot don''t bother shooting birds as they will manage to fly away each time. Causing them discomfort is not good. This is just my opinion you can differ.[/quote]\n\nMy observation with Gamo Shadow 1000:\n\nMatch: Excellent for paper targets\n\nMagnum Pro: Easily takes out a crow at 25 yards with a single shot 7 out of 10 times.

Thanks Sir, I needed your mature opinion as well as other senior members''. Well, according to your post, it seems like license holders have no option, apart from covering themselves up with genuine demand note copies. Well, if so, I would suggest two further steps apart from the DN: 2) check your entry with the National Bank, on the booklet numbers as mentioned  in the license.3) Verify the entry at the DCO office on the booklet numbers as mentioned in the license. This is, if you had let the agent do ALL the work, from application to receipt. Yet, I must say, it''s a pity indeed, that there is no direct way to ascertain this issue, fearing that you may be QUESTIONED by the FIA, in case of fake ones, notwithstanding that you applied for the privilege with all good intent! Wonder, if we as a MATURE platform, on behalf of THIS forum, and if Abbas thought it feasible, could have a DIRECT interaction with the MOI to OBLIGE to our verification requests, so at least none of OUR members ever ended in troubles. Additionally, we could appoint ONE agent/Dealer in every major city, with established credibility,  to take fresh applications from OUR members, like Abbas''s arrangement with the P.A.R.A in Lahore.

INSERT INTO `searchcore_text` (`searchcoreid`, `keywordtext`, `title`) VALUES
(61576, ' Gentlemen, \n\nWe have made progress since yesterday. We are talking about intent….and thus the plot thickens Dr. Watson!!!\n\nReplies are in order of mails\n\n@Omer571\nFirstly thank you for sharing with us the hadith, I too hope that none of us are ever put in a situation like this. And if we are we should be prepared. \n\nFurthermore you have asked the million dollar question. Do we really know if the intruder is a thief, rapist or a murderer… The honest answer is that we do NOT know. He may well be a thief, or a rapist or a murderer and may also be all of the above. So how do we make that an educated judgment call? I my view the following things come to mind, which are only my opinion and I will let you make your own choice which should be also vetted by Law. Any news from Topak?\n\n1.	If the intruder threatens our life or that of our loved ones he should be shot (if we are in that position).\n2.	If the thief has come to steal and is doing so without waking you up he is mostly only interested in stealing and nothing more that that. (This was the case when the robbers came and stole from our family. \n3.	If the intruder comes in the only thing he does is to wake you up with a life threat than he is most likely the most dangerous kind possibly looking for some revenge. In which case he might not be alone. There may be a few of them… may no one be ever put in that situation. \n\nThese are not the only scenarios and every situation may be different with its set of permutations and combinations. What we can do is to be prepared. My personal aim would be to raise an alarm before such a threatening situation is presented. A good alarm system. Which does not have to be expensive… it could be a \n\n1.	A dog in the house\n2.	Sensors which turn the lights on\n3.	Window and door sensors\n4.	Point of entry in your house should be minimized. Doors which are normally not used should be secured to the best of your ability. \n5.	A very inexpensive system is multiple bells on door knobs. They start clinging as soon as the knob is turned. \n6.	And if the bells or what ever your alarm system rings make sure to fire some shots in the air. If the intruder still tries to break in you know his intent is serious and you might have to take the required action. \n\nPlease remember to lock your doors with multiple locks if possible, in which case the thief will have to break the door, which would clearly show his intent and it will also give you the extra few seconds to arm your self and protect your loved ones. Drills with your family to take them to a secure location in you rooms/house should be rehearsed regularly. If you do not have such a secure location maybe today you may want to think of creating one. The aim is for you to take your family to safety in seconds inside your identified space of your room/house. Secondly in this space you should be protected from fire and it should be a position from were your firing view is unobstructed. In my case it is a walk in closet reinforced by concrete I still have to work on the firing position. Your home construction will also play a role in identifying this space.\n\nThe robbers who came to the family house only went in the rooms which were not locked. Their intent was clear to steal money and cash they were not interested in a confrontation. But I am sure if a confrontation did occur they would have been armed. \n\nGentlemen, one more thing. We are told that if a situation such as this arises on the road and the robbers ask for your car one is advised to give it without a fight. Statistics show that your chances are better to give valuables and cash on the road rather than putting up a fight. Usually road robbers operate in gangs. They come on both driver and passenger sides and have back up which comes in only when required. We are all grown men here you may make your own judgment call. \n\nI could have given this advice in the beginning, but I wanted to know how we all react as a society. Unfortunately the pendulum is tilted towards firing to death, which is what would be required only if the situation calls for it. A thief who is only there to rob and he makes that clear by not disturbing you will attack if he is aggravated. Be safe, be wise and use your guns only when required to protect your family and loved ones. My views may differ from yours and they are only views. They have no legal bearing or otherwise. The only two things which I can tell you with certainty is that I pray for all our safety may you all be safe and in peace. And the second thing I can tell you is that after all this discussion we still don’t know the exact legal /police implications. \n\n@Sohail, \nInteresting grading system\n\n@Zubair 723\nHope we are not in that situation\n\n@Naveed_Pk\nThis is the first time I have seen the X+ system, interesting. \n\n@KageFox, \nThe intruder has no right on your possession or valuables, only you have right over that. The discussion here is to determine if he only steals your valuables what are the legal implications if you shoot him. Only a discussion to determine what the law would do.\n\n@Sensei, \nI am not the authority to tell you what to do, like you I am here to find out what should be done. One thing is suggested above we should all take the necessary precautionary measures to give us time to protect our family. My personal view is that if your family member’s life is threatened with a dagger or a gun you have the right to shoot the ‘SOB’ to death. But as yet no lawyer has validated this claim so my quest like yours continues. Topak we call on you again to give us your views.…………', ''),

This place is located near Agha''s supermarket in Clifton, Karachi. Their training institution is called National Arms academy. Someone suggested that they do Executive training, but the cost is quite steep. About 12-15K for individuals. If you have a group then probably 10K. Anyways, I approached these guys last week and they said they don''t offer any for the time being, but they will contact me later. Gave them my business card, but they were not very enthusiastic and did not give me a price quote right away.\n\nDoes someone know the Chief Executive of National Arms and can arrange a 2-3 day course at reasonable rate for our members (especially total rookies like me)?.

I can''t exactly remember the model number, but few months back there was one M-16 style .22 rifle with P.A.R.A within your range, NIB. Made in Philippines, I think by Armscor.

(62191, ' @Bored2676,\nIn practice this is how it actually happens. Which is unfortunate! But there is hope many times the judiciary (when independent) has taken the right decision. In fact in most cases if the Judge is honest and you are fighting a case backed by law the decision will go in your favor. \nI still question if we can shoot someone dead and that is up to us (talking about an intruder entering the house). I believe that motive has to be established. \n\nIf we can establish that the intruder was there to cause bodily harm inclusive of death then we have a case. If however the petty thief whose motive was to steal alone then we may be charged with second degree murder. Remember the burden of proof is on us now. Again this is my observation and it is not backed by law so all lawyers are requested to let us know if this understanding is correct or not. This brings us to how motive is established. (Again my assumption) If the thief is going about the house and he is only stealing whatever he can find without confronting you then he is mostly only interested in stealing. If however the thief is aggressive and makes that known by breaking your door in and threatening your life with death along with your loved ones then we can establish that he was there to harm you and you are justified in killing him. This brings us to the final question the thief was in your house he has taken your valuables without harming you or your family what do you do. Do you shoot him in the leg????

The shots are made of small steel pallets  and do not pass through  the barrel tightly as in the case of pistols or rifles. Thus the wear is minimal.\n\nDont have an idea if slugs are used.

(62468, ' The aforementioned reasons are basically why HPs are recommended for defence. Take the context of 9x19mm. 9mm FMJs (ball ammo) tend to zip through muscle and flesh, without causing much damage. As said above, HPs expand upon impact, making a larger wound channel, and due to expansion, have slowed down enough to remain in the body.\n\nFor calibers 9mm and smaller, I would always recommend hollowpoints. Bigger calibers such as the .45 ACP, and the .455 Webley in its day, caused enough damage with regular ball ammo, simply due to their larger diameters and slower velocities.', ''),

Finish: well here it lacks. the finish is very rough.\n\n2. Robustness: well here it wins big time. if u look at the picture posted above (viking vs glock) u''ll see that this gun is built to last and to withstand some serious abuse. every part is heavily fortified. in the picture u can see that Viking''s chamber is quit thick (heavily built) compared to a glock. if u look inside a viking u''ll see that even the polymer frame is heavily fortified with steel inserts. \n\nthe barrel of a Viking is something to look at as well. its sorta conical in shape, starts out thick then thins out to typical/normal barrel thickness then again thickens out at the end. whereas typical barrels are of uniform/normal/typical thickness all over.\n\nViking''s locking lug is twice as thick and twice as big compared to other handguns that i''ve seen so far. so what does all that tell ya? if not robustness.\n\nRegards.', ''),

The ones that are the life blood of any comprehensive rebuild ( the bumpers , the front grill , rear garnish with tail lights etc ). But nevertheless 10 out of 10 for the styling of this car . \n\nSecondly the engine swap in progress will kind of make it over engined and nose heavy ( over steer ). To compensate for that the kind of suspension engg required like coil overs and polyurethene bushings and big brake conversion , thicker anti sway bars ) is very difficult and expensive.\n\nHey brother i am not trying to discourage u . Full marks to u for initiating this project . But if i were u i would have opted for a KP starlet with a 3sgte swap . The car is much easier to buy in good condition . The  3sgte with a Bigger intercooler and a mitsu evo turbo ( many available 2nd hand ) and 20 to 30 % of extra boost and fuel ). THe result will be absolutely  staggering .

(62502, ' @takenleader: Thx for your help and suggestions brother, I highly appreciate your words. Yeah, the TA+RA22/23/28 are in top 5 muscle cars ever produced by Japanese. Secondly, when it comes with ''Gran Turismo'' edition, that''s what adds a true muscle to that generation :)\n\nLuckily, most of it''s parts were all originals and that''s why I''m restoring it to the most-original state. Parts availability in Pakistan is of course an issue, but Australian market''s quite comfortingly welcoming, so its sort of a non-issue in Red Storm''s case. Yeah, the Blue Devil would have to await a couple of imports, but it''s turn is far away at the moment!\n\nThe stock TA22 weighed 1120KG with engine, transmission and everything in it. That 2T (original/stock) engine was made much of solid steel for those days (35+) years back, alloy wasn''t considered an affordable option in much of the then hot rods. The 1JZ is much light weight as most of it''s parts are made of light weight alloy as it is, yet again, a GT booster ;) A TA22 with a 1JZ and it''s huge turbo and its transmission weight 1040KG i.e. 80KG lesser than the stock! We have an opposite case here. Fortunately, my contractor is not a mechanic, he''s one highly educated pro who thinks tech and talks physics. Of course, it costs me way more than that of typical mechanics, but would definitely pay on track :)\n\nI respect your suggestion but I''m more into muscles and old-school hot rods, KP Starlet wouldn''t be an option for a guy like me for it''s way too non-impressive a ride.\n\nMoreover, a 3SGTE is one small motor too, there''s no comparison to a V6 1JZ GTE VVT-i 24 Valve Dohc Turbo because the 3SGTE and that too it''s latest generation produces 260HP (at 6500RPM: a long long time after stretching the machine closer to the boost-cut limits) stock with the max torque of 310NM that too at the higher RPMs. Whereas a 1JZ GTE VVT-i''s non-tuned/stock motor produces 280HP at lower RPMs which is stretchable upto 700HP while the initial and unstretchable torque being 379NM and that too at 2400RMP! Taken to 700HP (650wheels HP) with just a couple of additions which are cheap to go (incl. traction management), the torque goes to 480-to-550NM at 2400-to-3000RPM. Even the fastest ever edition of Mitsubishi Evolution (Evolution VIII) behaves like a baby-girls before (and much-behind) a 1JZ powered Supra ;) ( [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnf6aGacx8k[/url] )\n\nThat''s the reason I''m putting in 1JZ''s latest generation. You might have given a look at the engine I imported; it''s only 23000km driven and just like brand new, it was ''the best'' engine but of course, earned at a higher bid. But anyway, quality is never cheap too.\n\nPlease don''t take it as I totally disapprove your suggestions. I actually respect when someone as enthusiastic as I am shows a serious concern :)', ''),

But my humble advice u have got a fabulous cars project going on that is okay . U r new motor 1jzgte is is 23000 km that sounds like music to my ears . BUt dont believe to much in that 700 bhp figure . We live in pakistan and they way to go is fast.but reliable . 700 bhp with stock internals is stretching the envelope to the limit . NOw the goras do that coz they have standalone fuels managment system , Fully programmable ecU, a higher octane fuel .and last but not the least they have professional turbo specialists to tune their cars on a rolling road . See on a turbo charged application more power means u have to turn on the boost .NOe as long as u dont go more then 20 to 30 % of incremental boost it is fine > Probably then u will need a a fuel cut defender. But from then onwards the problem really grow exponentially . See ur stock turbo charger is not that efficent coa toyota didnt want it to be that way . The turbo has it efficent range within which it operates . when u wind up the boost it starts overreving and as a result starts to transfer heat into the the compressor side . as result u r intake temperature starts to rise . U r  stock intercooler will not cool the intake charge so either u go for a bigger intercooler or a desi tareeka water spray on it . But for 650 at the wheels with stock internals woosh i guess Formula one tech staff might manage it with 3 to 4 on board computers . For us mortals to have a reliable 650 bhp 1jzgte u have to spend alot more on the engine the the engine itself , computers , intercooler piping . throttle body . a biger turbo charger and the list goes on . So Brother i dont know the mechanic u have hired . But generally they quote out of this world figure of BHP . hey brother i guess i proving to be a pain in the neck for u appologies for that .:lol:. Its u r car and u r decision but JUst dont blow that engine in the quest for unrealistic BHP. The thing to watchout for is "D E T O N A T I O N". allah hafiz', ''),

This is important when we discuss whether we shoot someone.  My impression is that most places will not justify shooting someone for picking up a child''s bicycle from your yard and running off with it.\n\nSome places will allow you to defend your home from the burglar.\n\nMost places allow you to use deadly force to stop someone from robbing you.\n\nIn Texas, the person entering a home by force, at night, gets dead.  A person robbing another, get''s dead.  A person committing a theft at night gets dead. A person committing theft during the day time gets a thumpin'', but we can''t shoot them.\n\nThese are general explanations, the law is sometimes more complicated.\n\nYour laws may differ.', ''),

(62590, ' Salam All,\nIn the US there is a city (will try to dig up its name) which passed an ordinance requiring its residents to own guns, hence the crime rate there is next to nothing.  Also in response to this there is a city in N. US which passed a law requiring all citizens to be gunless... and guess what?  Their city too is crimeless!!!  Either extreme works.  Its when you mix the two and come to the center dividing line where things always get messy.  Over all things are really messy and greyish when it comes to guns in US.  Its one of the top agendas during elections following abortion.  Most of the gun control laws are passed by the Handgun Control Inc. headed up by Sarah Brady (Brady Bill), She is the wife of one of the staff members of Ronald Reagan.  When Ronald Reagan was shot, her husband was shot in the head during the attack, although he has survived, talks and barely walks, his wife went made it a mission in life to go after gun owners no matter how.  She succeeds whenever there is a Democratic Pres. and fails when a Rep. President is elected.  The High Capacity PERMANENT Ban Bill is currently in the house awaiting passage.  More than likely it will pass into law and all highcapacity mags will be banned in the US forever.  Hence the buying frenzy in the US.  And although one has the right to keep and bear arms in the US.  There are many ways around this to control guns.  One of the oldest has been the NFA whereby PB weapons are taxed and then issued a stamp.  The BATF simply refuses to issue the stamp and hence you can''t own that weapon because its illegal.  Title 18 USC is a very picky penal code.\n\nIn Canada, also a gun loving country which up until 2002 didn''t require a license or permits for guns - took a dive into the deep end of gun control mainly due to biker gang violence coming from across the border from US.  They first had an amnesty law in which all firearms PB and NPB were registered.  Then they basically issue you an id which can be had when you enroll in a gun club, take firearms courses, and pass.  You are then issued a PAL upon which you can then go about purchasing weapons.  They have computerized their system and are very quick in processing.\n\nIn Switerzerland... Well what can I say, been there several times... hmmm its a gun lovers paradise.  Its the ONLY country in the world that has the most lenient gun laws and its people/government promote gun ownership.  They even have a week during every year when they all come out and walk around parading with various weapons.  All one needs to do is go to the nearest jurisdictional Canton and register whatever and whichever firearm(s) they want and then walk out with it.  Too bad getting nationality their can take up to 15 years!!!  Otherwise I would be there.  If you know a Swiss citizen and that person is willing to vouch on your character in a Canton, you can buy a gun from there.', ''),

(62755, ' The city''s population grew from around 5,000 in 1980 to 13,000 by 1996. In 1982, Kennesaw Georgia passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in their home, exempting those with criminal records or religious objections. Yet, after the law went into effect in 1982, there have been only three murders: two with knives (1984 and 1987) and one with a firearm (1997).Seven months after it took effect, the residential burglary rate dropped 89%, vs. 10.4% statewide. Crime against persons plummeted 74 percent compared to 1981, and fell another 45 percent in 1983 compared to 1982. And it has stayed impressively low. \nIn addition to nearly non-existent homicide, the annual number of armed robberies, residential burglaries, commercial burglaries, and rapes have averaged, respectively, 1.69, 31.63, 19.75, and 2.00 through 1998. \n\nWith all the attention that has been heaped upon the lawful possession of firearms lately, you would think that a city that requires gun ownership would be the center of a media feeding frenzy. It isn''t. The fact is I can''t remember a major media outlet even mentioning Kennesaw. Can you? The reason is obvious. Kennesaw proves that the presence of firearms actually improves safety and security. This is not the message that the media want us to hear. They want us to believe that guns are evil and are the cause of violence. The facts tell a different story. \n\nWhat is even more interesting about Kennesaw is that the city''s crime rate decreased with the simple knowledge that the entire community was armed. The bad guys didn''t force the residents to prove it. Just knowing that residents were armed prompted them to move on to easier targets. Most criminals don''t have a death wish.', ''),

(62757, ' Here is an opinion by one of the TOP Supreme Court Attorney specializing in the right to keep and bear arms has to say.\n\nArmed to the Teeth, and Free\nby Stephen P. Halbrook\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Europe June 4, 1999\n\nIn 1994, when the U.S. Congress debated whether to ban "assault weapons," a talk show host asked then-Senator Bill Bradley (New Jersey), a sponsor of the ban, whether guns cause crime. The host noted that, in Switzerland, all males are issued assault rifles for militia service and keep them at home, yet little crime exists there. Sen. Bradley responded that the Swiss "are pretty dull." \n\nFor those who think that target shooting is more fun than golf, however, Switzerland is anything but "dull." By car or train, you see shooting ranges everywhere, but few golf courses. If there is a Schuetzenfest (shooting festival) in town, you will find rifles slung on hat racks in restaurants, and you will encounter men and women, old and young, walking, biking and taking the tram with rifles over their shoulders, to and from the range. They stroll right past the police station and no one bats an eye. (Try this in the U.S., and a SWAT Team might do you in.) \n\nTourists-especially those from Japan, where guns are banned to all but the police-think it''s a revolution. But shooting is the national sport, and the backbone of the national defense as well. More per capita firepower exists in Switzerland than in any other place in the world, yet it is one of the safest places to be. \n\nAccording to the U.N. International Study on Firearm Regulation, England''s 1994 homicide rate was 1.4 (9% involving firearms), and the robbery rate 116, per 100,000 population. In the United States, the homicide rate was 9.0 (70% involving firearms), and the robbery rate 234, per 100,000. England has strict gun control laws, ergo, the homicide rate is lower than in the U.S. However, such comparisons can be dangerous: In 1900, when England had no gun controls, the homicide rate was only 1.0 per 100,000. \n\nMoreover, using data through 1996, the U.S. Department of Justice study "Crime and Justice" concluded that in England the robbery rate was 1.4 times higher, the assault rate was 2.3 times higher, and the burglary rate was 1.7 times higher than in the U.S. This suggests that lawfully armed citizens in the U.S. deter such crimes. Only the murder and rape rates in the U.S. were higher than in England. The small number of violent predators who commit most of these crimes in the U.S. have little trouble arming themselves unlawfully. \n\nThe U.N. study omits mention of Switzerland, which is awash in guns and has substantially lower murder and robbery rates than England, where most guns are banned. \n\nHere are the figures: The Swiss Federal Police Office reports that in 1997 there were 87 intentional homicides and 102 attempted homicides in the entire country. Some 91 of these 189 murders and attempts involved firearms. With its population of seven million (including 1.2 million foreigners), Switzerland had a homicide rate of 1.2 per 100,000. There were 2,498 robberies (and attempted robberies), of which 546 involved firearms, resulting in a robbery rate of 36 per 100,000. Almost half of these crimes were committed by non-resident foreigners, whom locals call "criminal tourists." \n\nSometimes, the data sound too good to be true. In 1993, not a single armed robbery was reported in Geneva. \n\nNo one seems to be looking at the Swiss example in the U.S., however. Congress is stampeding to pass additional firearm restrictions in response to the events of April 20, when two students used guns and bombs to murder a dozen classmates and a teacher in Littleton, Colorado. Yet in 1996, a man who legally owned guns under England''s strict regulations went on a rampage, murdering 16 children and a teacher in Dunblane, Scotland. Parliament then banned all handguns and most rifles. \n\nBut there have been no school massacres in Switzerland, where guns and kids mix freely. At shooting matches, bicycles aplenty are parked outside. Inside the firing shelter, the competitors pay 12-year-olds tips to keep score. The 16-year-olds shoot rifles with men and women of all ages. In fact, the tourist brochure "Zurich News" recommends September''s Knabenschiessen (boy''s shooting contest) as a must-see: "The oldest Zurich tradition . . . consists of a shooting contest at the Albisguetli (range) for 12 to 16 year-old boys and girls and a colorful three-day fun-fair." The event has been held since 1657, and attracts thousands of teenage participants and spectators. \n\nWhile many shoot for sport, all males aged 20 to 42 are required by militia system regulation to keep rifles and/or pistols at home. In addition, gun shops abound. Yet firearms are rarely used in crime. Homicide is tied to a willingness to resort to violence, not the mere presence of guns. The prevalence of firearms in the home and the participation of youth in shooting matches bind youth to adults and discourages a generation gap. \n\nBy contrast, homicide rates are highest in the underdeveloped countries, many of which ban private firearm possession. In some, private murder does not compare to the genocidal murder committed by governments against their unarmed subjects. \n\nIn America, firearms take on a sinister reputation from the nightly news and violent movies. But in Switzerland, firearms symbolize a wholesome, community activity. The typical weekend shooting festival brings out the entire family. Beside the range is a huge tent where scores or hundreds of people are eating, drinking, and socializing. \n\nWith cantonal and rifle club banners fluttering in the wind, the melody of rifle fire blends with Alpine music and cow bells. Since its founding in 1291, Switzerland has depended on an armed populace for its defense. William Tell used a crossbow not only to shoot the apple from his son''s head, but also to kill the tyrant Gessler. For centuries, the cantonal republic defeated the powerful armies of the European monarchs. Machiavelli wrote in 1532: "The Swiss are well armed and enjoy great freedom." \n\nThis coincidence has not escaped the notice of those who oppose liberty. \n\nMonarchist philosopher Jean Bodin, writing in 1606, denounced free speech and arms possession by commoners. Subjects must be disarmed to prevent democratic sedition, he said. The Swiss proved, Bodin wrongly averred, that arms bearing was "the cause of an infinite number of murders." \n\nThe Swiss militia model, however, preserved democracy and held Europe''s despots at bay. In fact, it inspired the rebellious American colonists. John Adams praised the democratic Swiss Cantons, where every man was entitled to vote on laws and to bear arms. Patrick Henry, another American Founding Father, lauded the Swiss for maintaining their independence without "a mighty and splendid President" or a standing army. \n\nThe Swiss influence is clear in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Today, it has become fashionable to hate this orphan of the Bill of Rights. \n\nHowever, a quick glance at history shows that tyrannical governments kill far more than do private criminals. But first, governments must disarm their victims. In 1933, the Nazis seized power via massive search-and-seizure operations for firearms against "Communists," i.e., all political opponents. In 1938, during the Night of the Broken Glass, they disarmed the Jews. When the Nazis occupied Europe in 1939-41, they proclaimed the death penalty for any person who failed to surrender all firearms within 24 hours. \n\nThere may be various reasons why the Nazis did not invade Switzerland, but one of those reasons is that every Swiss man had a rifle at home. For this we have no better record than the Nazi invasion plans, which stated that, because of the Swiss shooting skills, Switzerland would be difficult to conquer and pacify. European countries occupied by the Nazis had strict gun controls before the war, and the registration lists facilitated confiscation of firearms and the execution of their owners. \n\nBy being able to keep out of both world wars in part through the dissuasive factor of an armed populace, Switzerland demonstrates that civilian firearm possession may prevent large numbers of deaths and even genocide. The Holocaust never came to Switzerland, the Jewish population of which was armed just like their fellow citizens. In the rest of Europe, what if there had been not just one, but two, three, or many Warsaw Ghetto Uprisings? \n\nTraditionally, the Swiss Cantons had few firearm regulations. The first federal firearms law was recently enacted. Certain firearm purchases require a permit, and others do not. On retirement, every soldier may keep his rifle or pistol. Surplus assault rifles may be purchased by any Swiss citizen from the Military Department. \n\nThe bottom line is one of attitude. Populations with training in civic virtue, though armed, do not experience sensational massacres or high crime rates. Indeed, armed citizens deter crime. Switzerland fits this mold. Similarly, America''s lawful "gun culture" is peaceful. Sadly, some of its subcultures are not.', ''),
(62758, ' Some other quotes taken from the internet.\n\nQuotes\n\n"The very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere restrains evil interference. They deserve a place of honor with all that is good. When firearms go, all goes. We need them every hour." - George Washington in address to the 2nd session of united States Congress. \n"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and when the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.” Henry St. George Tucker, in Blackstone''s 1768 “Commentaries on the Laws of England.", Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court & U.S. Dist. Court of Virginia \n\n"Laws that forbid the carrying of arms...disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man." - Thomas Jefferson, quoting Cesare Beccaria \n\n"The strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." - Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C.J.Boyd, Ed., 1950) \n\n"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing." - Edmund Burke \n\n"For the first time in history does a nation have complete gun registration. Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient. The world will follow our lead in the future." - Adolph Hitler, 15 April 1935, in address to the Reichstag', '');

(62876, ' [quote=Firepower!][quote=Zubair 723]Its the sole reason so many accidents have happened.[/quote]\n\n\nSir, I disagree. It is not the sole reason for accidents. Accidents are generally from negligence. A pistol (modern day quality pistols) wont go off on their own. You need to pull the trigger. The handgund related accidents are generally not from carrying one in the pipe. In fact, a person who carries a loaded chamber is always prudent to check his weapon and not let it be handled with by others. These accidents are generally occuring by negligence in cleaning and handling. Not while carrying in holster.[/quote]\n\n\nSir I disagree with you as well. You contradict your own statement. You started with that "the accidents happen due to negligence" and would you please tell me that which error would be more dangerous. A negligent error happening with an un-chambered weapon or a chambered weapon. Sir the accidents happen due to negligence and there are more chances of an accident with a chambered weapon than non chambered given all other factors common or non-variables e.g a trigger being pulled of a chambered weapon is likely to have an accident or will have dangerous effects while that of a non chambered weapon will not have an accident or dangerous effects', ''),

The aforementioned three Taurus pistols have a proven reliability record, and will be more than enough. Other options include the Stoeger Cougar, the Baikal Viking and the CZ999.

To start HD with .22, I doubt. Yes handling a gun might be a problem which can be over come after practice and practice one requires even with smaller calibers.\n\n@Mani1\n                Pistols are difficult to handle for reasons mentioned earlier. In revolvers no chambering required, no loading / unloading required, no conceal carry issue, no lengthy battles (need for more capacity). It is just an advise, you can make up your own mind. This is Taurus 608. Click on any model to see the details\n\n[url]http://www.taurususa.com/gun-search.cfm[/url]\n\nAs far as carrying a weapon is concerned please avoid it. Young blood has a tendency to carry them and then talking of CC, implying smaller weapons with less power, aiming to do what? What are you up to? Brother you are not in law protection where you come across BG quite frequently and you carry a bigger gun with a smaller CC as back up. Remember, only use the weapon as a last resort. Your life is more important than any other worldly thing, honour not withstanding. If you are mugged on gun point don,t do any silly move unless you are sure that you have a chance. The guy mugging you is more jittery and under pressure than what you are. He can pull the trigger on any unexpected move on your part as he feels endangered. HD is a separate issue where you are in your house and have an early warning of intruders with time, house protection and awareness on your side. This may not happen on road once you are vulnerable and surprised. Remember, once a weapon is drawn there is no turning back. So be sure of your weapon, your capabilities and wait for appropriate time. Don,t be emotional and my humble opinion is don,t carry the weapon. Keep it at your place.

(63001, ' Welcome to Pakguns :)\n\n9mm or .45? Depends on what you''d like to spend on ammo. As is obvious, 9mm ammo is quite cheaper, compared to the .45 ACP. More experienced members can give you an idea of cost difference per round. \n\nWith that out of the way, you have two options if you want a Taurus in .45. The 1911 Dr Zakir mentioned is a very good option, very popular among 1911 aficionados these days. There''s also the 24/7 in .45, which is reported to perform better in .45 than in 9mm. \n\nIf you decide that .45 is not for you and wish to go for a 9mm for home defence and range work, your best bet would be the Taurus PT99 (adjustable sights), though other options are PT92 & PT917 (fixed sights). If you are into concealed carry, you could also consider the Taurus PT909. The Taurus 24/7 in 9mm is known to have reliability issues with more than a few members. Last, but not least, you could look around for the Taurus PT809.

(63076, 'Review: Baikal IZH-27EM-1C O/U Shotgun Here is my new shotgun. This gun is just out of the box, so lubrication, greasing & polish is still due. \n\n[b]Looks[/b] As a first impression, the gun is half as good looking as other O/Us available in the market in the 50k bracket and in no league with the premium brands. Its like Russian Belarus (nick named Roosi) tractor. Its big & ugly but the monster is strong enough in its hydraulics that it can jack itself up unlike any other in the market.\n\n[b]Weight[/b] Feels & it is slightly heavier than synthetic finished O/Us. Its taken as an advantage to absorb a portion of kick that cumulates to mild bruises after a days shoot without a padded jacket.\n\n[b]Finish[/b] Not a refined or finely finished gun in any way. I was looking for something that I could refer to as ''delicate'' or ''flimsy'' but couldn''t find any. Parts of the gun look like as if they are made for a battlefield rather than casual sports shooting. Thick & solid. It takes more effort to breech open the gun than to open the main gate of my house. Probably because its new and hopefully it will soften before my son inherits it.\n\n[b]Accessories[/b]Comes with only three chokes in total. Nothing else like extensions, pads, 5 chokes etc etc. Manual is an option, sometimes its available in the box.\n\n[b]Performance[/b] Thats why I bought it.

I think I alot of you have recommended the CF-98 in this price class, however, I am really put off by the safety lever being so hard.

They will usually become much less stiff with repeated use.  Also, please consider that you may be simply unfamiliar with the "proper" way to engaged/disengage the safety.  A little practice may change your opinion of the safety.\n\nYou have several choices:\n\n1- Not buy that model or that particular gun\n2- Buy it and spend time every evening flipping the safety on and off to loosen it up.\n3- Take it to a smith (or if you are willing to take the risk yourself) and sand the proper area to reduce the pressure and resistance.\n\nBest of luck, let us know what you decide and how it works out.[/quote]\n\nI have gone for a Sarsilmaz CM9 for now.

And I am with you on almost everything you say. Moving forward we still need to establish what the law has to say. \n\n@StevenCline, \n\nThank you for defining the difference between burglary, theft, robbery (aggravated robbery). I am not sure if Texas also follows a variant of common law, if Texas was a state in Pakistan you would have answered some of my questions. By the way when I visited Texas it reminded me of home (Peshawar). There is a very strong gun culture there. Another similar habit was the love for red meat, I have yet to have a bigger stake. \n\nAnd yes Basharat is the only one who has come close to defining the law, questions of motive, intent, and in your terms can we shoot a burglar, thief or robber here in Pakistan? Burden of proof issues? A new member and a professor of law has joined. He might be able to give a detailed explanation of intruder entry. The night day shooting is also interesting. Thank you and Basharat for your contribution to the thread. However the law here is a bit more complicated that is why we are still discussing it and everyone has their own interpretation of the law. I wish it was black and white and we have ended the discussion much earlier. \n\n@Enigmatic Desires, \n\nThe system of justice is what we also need to develop so that we can also reap the benefits of a good system in our own country. Unfortunately we are party to the systems failures; in this case we can not blame it entirely on the system. But I would not mind living in Texas for a few weeks every year. ?\n\n@Zubair723 and Omer 571\n\nUnfortunate but true. And when it comes to our homes we take other decisions. I pray for all your safety at the commercial markets. I wish we stood strong along side the brave and no one would be able to threaten them. \n\n@KageFox, \nIndeed the system works well in Saudi Arabia. They used to leave their shops open during prayers. Strong law is a powerful deterrent\n\n@Zubair723, \n\nSmart comment. I LIKE IT!!!!\n\n@KageFox, Omer571, and Zubair723, \n\nIf we had a strong system in which there was justice for all then we would not even think such thoughts let alone type them. \n\n@Malik1, \n\nThe legality of such acts is the real aim of the topic. Professor has joined we invite you to share your views looking at it from a legal angle.  \n\nI thank all of you for making this discussion interesting. I hope we can get to the bottom of this and can close this topic with clean concrete thought.\n\nps\n@Omer571, \n\nForgot, regardless of whether the discussion took place, I have a clue that it did!!

(63143, ' The bitter truth of this is that it is not only the uneducated people of Pakistan whom decide to take part in aerial shooting, it is also the educated people. In Karachi for instance, there are people whom indulge in this stupidity at Eid, when Pakistan wins a cricket match, on weddings, 14 august, birthdays, public shows of power and an uncountable number of other occasions.\n\n Truth be told, there is no fun in firing in the air, and still if someone feels that the cannot help themselves (which is very very sad) they should at least use blanks. It goes without saying that the man in the incident is subject to extreme stupidity which resulted in probable loss of his life, however, we need to take a moment to think about where all of those bullets fell. Numerous people could have died due to bullets "from unknown directions" coming and hitting them. This guy was lucky to have people know that he was brutally murdered, others may not have that privilege. This tragedy comes around due to a complete and absolute disregard of responsibility; Education comes much later on. Knowing not to fire bullets in the air is common sense. Something that these people lack greatly.\n\nPeople stand up today and say that these people were stupid. You are all right! But sadly, at the end of the day, some of us turn around and do the same things over again, whether it be in public gatherings or within the vicinity of our homes. I just pray for the day that people like this will get some kind of a grasp on how to be responsible and be a better citizen of our beloved Pakistan. \n\nAstughfirullah', ''),

Beretta have not yet published anything yet, but from what I have read, their new autoloader shotgun, Xplor UNICO A400, it is a refinement of the Beretta Xtrema 2 and 391.[/i]\n\n[i] \nBeretta Xplor - It is Green!\nOver the weekend I was searching for photos of the new shotgun, and even emailed my contact at Beretta USA, but all I could find was some pretty boring images taken by Beretta showing it being shot from a distance. For some reason Beretta made all the journalists who attended the launch to agree not to publish any photos before November. I believe the photo above is legit. An Italian online store published it, only to take it down soon after (presumably after realizing they were not allowed to publish it). I have blurred out their name so that they do not get into any trouble.[/i]\n\n[i]Onto the shotgun itself ...[/i]\n\n[i]The shotgun will come chambered in a 3" version and 3.5" super-magnum version. It optionally features the new kick-off^3 (that is kick-off-cubed, for those of you who do not use spreadsheets) recoil reduction system stock. Two hydraulic dampers in the stock (the return spring is forward of the receiver, not in the stock) and another damper, maybe mercury or a spring mechanism, in the forend.[/i]\n\n[i]Jim Shepherd reports:[/i]\n\n[i]With our barrels plugged for only three shots, I didn''t get to try the four-shot speed, but I did empty my three shots at a rate I didn''t think possible-and aimed, not simply fired. That''s apparently due the test gun''s using Beretta''s new "Kick-Off" recoil reduction system. Along with a new Micro Core recoil pad, dual hydraulic dampers in the butt and a third to reduce recoil peak from the bit of the bolt against the receiver, it absolutely reduced the impact of a long day''s shooting.[/i]\n\n[i]Maybe the first recoil damper is inserted into the magazine, which would explain why they were not allowed more than three rounds loaded into the magazine? I don''t really know, I am guessing.[/i]\n\n[i]It uses a new gas system called the Beretta BLink. The name is a reference to its speed. Weighing in at 6.6 lbs, it is very light and slightly lighter than the Benelli Vinic.[/i]\n\n[i]James Marchington, of Sporting Shooter magazine (UK), published a scan of the specifications ...[/i]\n\n[i]Specifications	\nGauge	12 gauge\nChamber	3" or 3.5" (both will shorter cartridges)\nCapacity	Unknows\nReceiver	Aluminum\nFinish	Adonized color.

One of our esteemed members (don''t remember which - maybe ED) wrote about the poor performance of this gun in .30 caliber. Avoid it if you can, Go with a 9mm. .30 is best reserved for the TT and its variants.[/quote]\n\nI agree with KageFox. We have clonned a tried and tested model in 9mm. Original was never developed in Tokarev. Yet we know that we are only good at clonning thus.. I would say our men have not optimized it as a tokarev platform Or havent incorporated necessary changes required to launch Tokarev safely and effciently.\nTokarev from a 9mm platform such as Beretta and also given a clone of it, I would say the only thing going in Tokarev''s favor is a 5 inch barrel (not 4.92 like original 92FS, all Paki 92FS clones have 5 inch barrels) to launch it at good velocity, and (may be) a heavier slide and recoil spring in 92FS clones as compared to Pak made Tokarev Clones. \nYes.. you may verify this.

(63378, ' Thanks guys, took the Canik''s to the range yesterday for a more complete evaluation and shooting. We used the Piranha in Islamabad before the GTG for around a 100 rounds and I did not clean it purposely, shot about 100 plus rounds again though it yesterday for a total of 200 + without any cleaning what so ever and am happy to report that not a single FTF occurred. The Piranha compact was also fired for about 100 rounds and has the same reliability report. \n\nThe Piranha is a fantastic gun, the grips are nice, sights marvelous and the recoil and the balance very decent. The trigger although OEM could be mistaken for custom and pull is very crisp at around 3.5 pounds. The accuracy report you will see below. I would rate it *ideal* for range use and can and will pull it''s own weight against pistols 10 times it''s price in all categories. If I was a competition shooter I would prefer this over anything else I own.\n\nThe Piranha Compact is a very good gun as well. Frankly I think I should not have been testing a full frame pistol vs a compact on the same day but it still did not disappoint. For it''s size it''s great shooter. My piece was shooting a bit low, I thought it was me perhaps but I had more experienced shooters try with the same result. The recoil however was much more noticeable when firing against a full frame pistol, it will take most shooters off guard on the first few shots. The sound is very pleasant, unlike the Stoeger which to me sounds like a .30 TT. The combat grips make the pistol great to hold and will make sure the pistol will stay firmly in your hand in all situations. Although on the flip side, firing 100 rounds left my hand and skin a little sore. \n[b]\nHere is a 50 round test each of the Piranha and the Pirhana Compact. Targets were set at 10 M.[/b]\n\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/PiranhaCA.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Piranha Compact 50 Rounds.[/b]\n\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/PiranhaA.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Piranha 50 Rounds.

(63402, ' [quote=khakiMB]\n@StevenCline, \n\nThank you for defining the difference between burglary, theft, robbery (aggravated robbery). [/quote]\n\nPlease remember that my definitions are based on US law and Texas in particular.  They may not be the definitions in Pakistan.\n\n[quote]I am not sure if Texas also follows a variant of common law, if Texas was a state in Pakistan you would have answered some of my questions. By the way when I visited Texas it reminded me of home (Peshawar). There is a very strong gun culture there. Another similar habit was the love for red meat, I have yet to have a bigger stake. [/quote]\n\nYes, meat is good, big thick steaks even better!\n\n[quote]And yes Basharat is the only one who has come close to defining the law, questions of motive, intent, and in your terms can we shoot a burglar, thief or robber here in Pakistan? [/quote]\n\nPlease remember and consider well that I am NOT a lawyer, I am only opining on the clearly written statutes:\n\n[u][b]Concerning shooting a burglar[/b][/u] (someone who forcibly enters a habitation to commit a theft or other crime).  Then this part of Pakistan appears to give lawful justification to use deadly force:\n\n[quote]103.    "When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death:\nThe right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in Section 99, to the voluntary Causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:-\n\nSecondly:     House-breaking by night;\n\nFourthly:     Theft, mischief or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not exercised."\n[/quote]\n\n103 "Secondly" appears to me to say, if a person breaks into your home at night you are justified in using deadly force against him.  If I were in Pakistan and someone forced open a door or window at night and entered my home, I would shoot them.\n\n103 "Fourthly" may also give me justification to use deadly force (shoot) if there were other circumstances which reasonably cause me fear I would be killed or very badily hurt if I didn''t use shoot the housebreaker.  One possible example may be the house-trespasser who is much larger than me and does not flee my home when caught, or even advances on me.  Or is closing on a sword hanging on the wall or the gun safe.  If he gets to the sword or guns I would be in a lot of trouble.\n\n[u][b]Concerning "theft" or shooting a thief.[/b][/u]  I am presumming the definition of theft is simply taking from someone without permission.  I saw nothing in the 103 part of the law that which would jsutify shooting a thief.  If someone in Pakistan were to take my bicycle and ride off on it, I would not use deadly force (shoot) the thief to stop the crime he committing or stop the theft of my bicycle.\n\n[u][b]Concerning shooting a robber:[/b][/u]  The 103 law is also very clear, it says\n\n[quote]103.    "When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death:\nThe right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in Section 99, to the voluntary Causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:-\nFirst:     Robbery;[/quote]\n\nThe only question is how is "Robbery" defined by Pakistan''s law?  If you intend to justify shooting a person under the provision of stopping a robbery, then you would be very wise to know what a robbery is in Pakistan.  You would not want to be wrong in believing an act is robbery when it is not.\n\nJust to share, in the US, Robbery is often defined a crime against a person, not a crime against property.  This because the criminal is threatening a person in order to steal from him.  Deadly force is justified most often because of the threat directed at the person, not because the robber is taking property.\n\nOften times a person is justified in using deadly force to stop a robbery not because a robbery was being committed but because the robber was threatening a person with a knife or a gun to get the property.  The threat with a knife or gun (or bat or brick or bottle) is what made deadly force justified.\n\n[quote]Burden of proof issues? [/quote]\n\nGreat question- I don''t know.  A lawyer should definately be sought on this question.  In some US States the Prosecutor has the burden to prove that a burglar WAS NOT being committed, or a robbery was not being committed, while in others the person claiming justification/self-defense has the burden of proving he was being robbed or his home was being broken into at night. (How is, "night" defined by Pakistan law?)\n\n[quote]A new member and a professor of law has joined. He might be able to give a detailed explanation of intruder entry. The night day shooting is also interesting. Thank you and Basharat for your contribution to the thread. However the law here is a bit more complicated that is why we are still discussing it and everyone has their own interpretation of the law. I wish it was black and white and we have ended the discussion much earlier. [/quote]\n\nI think a few more quotes by Basaharat on the definitions of robbery, house-breaking, etc., and y''all will be in great shape.', ''),

(63436, ' Respceted buddies as glock is a serious self defence gun not a match shooter. As STI, KIMBER, SIG are very highly priced handguns. I have never shot STI, kimber but shot Sig 220, 226. All the sigs are accurate but are less natural pointing guns than glock with more muzzle flip. so quick accurate repeat shot has to be mastered. The most important thing in a self defence handgun is the gun relaiability which matters first and accuracy comes second. Glock is utterly reliable haveing natural pointability. I shot both HK & Glock many times and found that in quick reflex shooting, glock is a winner. HK vs Glock (9mm) with respect to price i suggest glock is the choice. I rather like HK .45 USP, though i have shot HK MARK 23 (potentialy accurate) because of the relatively thinner grip from the Glock 21, HK .45 USP feels and shoot better. My argument does not suggest that HK is a crap or bad they are one hell of a gun but.................. glock is an UPSET in the tournament.:)', ''),

How much shots are to be fired for chokes to pattern perfectly?\n2. Do we need to clean and lubricate trigger system also in a new gun? I read some where that we need to clean the whole gun with a solvent and then grease and lube all the mating surfaces; like hinge pin, fore-end iron, hinge pin slot, barrel hook etc.\n\nI''m asking because, I also have plan to buy Izh-27, just waiting for my license. :([/quote]\n\nhmm.... allow me to throw in my two cents.\n\n1. how many shots...... well, patterns have got nothing do with number of shots fired before getting a decent pattern. in actuality, its the opposite. the more the barrels fouls up and more the barrels heats up, more the patterns get disturbed. in other words, barrel fouling and temperature leads to disturbed patterns.\n\n2. yes its recommended to clean and lubricate the trigger system of a new gun. but not with grease. light oil for fast moving parts and moly grease for pressure points such as choke tube threads, (yes choke tube threads, they encounter pressure not speed, with pressure oil drains out of the threads causing the choke to cease whereas grease stays) hinges, pivots etc.\n\n3. as far as breakopen guns are concerned, I always advise to atleast open up the boxlock and clean everything inside. u''ll be surprised to see bright red colored wood shavings inside a Baikal IZH27. a clean receiver is the best insurance against stuck firing pin and doubling issues (both barrels firing at the same time with a single pull of the trigger).\n\nRegards.', ''),

Same with the Sig Sauers. \n\n[b]But[/b] when it comes to pure practical business there is nothing like a Glock. Consistent trigger pull each time, no safety distractions, comparatively easier to detail strip and reassemble than a HK or a Sig Sauer which really is an advantage when recovering from a malfunction, cheaper parts etc etc etc. There is nothing like a Glock when it comes to simplicity & practicality in any condition.\n\nHKs & Sig Sauers are usually ranked higher than a Glock due to the quality of their components as compared to the Glock but again quality of Glocks components is not bad at all. If you''re talking about those marginal tens of thousands of rounds yes your HK or Sig would stretch a bit far but who the heck shoots that much anyway.\n\nI own a number of Glocks, HKs, Sigs and yes three Kimber 1911s and with my Glock I''m a happy customer.\n\nIf I was comparing a Sig Sauer with a 1911 it would be a Wilson Combat or a Springfield 1911, but Kimber not a chance.

(63697, ' [quote=KageFox]Springfield Armory XD is a gun originally made in Croatia, under the name of HS2000. Springfield Armory has the license to make this gun.\n\nQSZ-92 is indeed the CF-98, I believe it to be the Chinese military designation.\n\nFN (Fabrique Nationale) is a very famous Belgian gunmaker, which also happens to own Winchester and Browning. The famed Browning Hi-Power GP-35 was made by FN. Many of the light machine guns in the US military are supplied by FN. One of FBI''s two primary sniper rifles is made by FN. The FN-FNP45 was recently made to compete in planned trials for selecting a new sidearm , which never took place.\n\nBackground and history of FN Five-Seven will take a while for me to write, but to make things short and simple, this pistol is chambered for the 5.7x28mm round, which has body-armor piercing capabilities. The higher velocity round also gives the pistol a slightly longer effective range. The round, I believe, has not been introduced to Pakistan, and neither is the pistol. Except for a version made for civilians in the US, I believe this pistol to have seen little action other than in the hands of special forces.\n\nHope that helps.[/quote]\n[b]\nThough FN''s total lack of presence in Pakistan puzzles me... I can only think that FN being a major military supplier has something to do with it.[/b]\n\nFN Hestral does have an agent for Pakistan, and they have made successful sales to the military, including the famed P90 to the special forces unit of PAF, and MiniMe to Pakistan Navy SSG. They are also in process to replace PAF SSG Glock with their pistol.\n\nI do not think the agent has any interest in civil sector marketing of the handgun. It is also not easy to get export permit for Belgium for anything fire arms related for Pakistan, civilian or military, even more so now.\n\nI hope you are less puzzled now.', ''),

(63778, ' quite interesting topic going on here:- Some of the answers which I found to these queries and thoughts are\n\nPOF 9mm ammo, one originally from POF and YES IT IS inconsistent in quality. I have personally verified it from dealers and seen different batches of it to give this statement. Every different batch of POF ammo coming out is of different color and quality. Case buldges are much likely to be observed in every 1 outa 5 round. Wherether you believe it or not! I would recommend to do a marketing research on it. What we are calling as fake POF is.. actually the original POF.\n\nstandard, +p and +p+ are well explained with regards to SAAMI specs.. Only +p+ is all commercial american thing if you are really into it. Standard 9mm is around 37,400psi on average which ranges as much as to 42000psi under SAAMI SPECS which marks it +p then BUT still under limit of its spec.  +p+ even further exceeds it. +p+ are actually commercial terms vastly used to market ammunition to power crazy people who want to add more power type of chronic thingy going on in their minds and to raise their curosity by classifying it to only L.E. 9mm is already a very high pressure round and a non-magnum caliber. Its case capacity has already took it to its limits. So only slight can be done and played with it. The term PROOF LOAD is known term in this regards. This type of ammo is used to proof test barrels chambers and firearm functioning limits and to testify its strength. Proof load by SAAMI spec is 49000psi approx. Many of these +p+ marketers exceed the pressure, bordering somewhere near to proof loadings. +p+ from different manufacturers under their different ammunition brands do not set a scale by which you could compare these. Some may define  +p+ as 43000psi and on an other brand of ammo from same company may mark +p+ at 47k psi. Its by all means a commercial hoopla.\n\nAs skeeter sb mentioned some pistols on their performance regarding +p+ consumption. Nearly each and every firearm maker advertise its weapon to stay within the SAAMI SPEC of which the max is +p (42000psi). Any weapon beyond that would wear or function erratically. Glock are no exception. \nyou can check it on glock world - [url]http://www.glockworld.com/content.aspx?Ckey=gwa_9mm[/url]\n\n[quote]POF advertises its mkII at 1110 or 1115 or so fps. Which by all means does not take it much to a high powered 9mm. Its a standard round as per their disclosed statistics. unlike US M882 ball 9mm ammo which is a high powered 9mm and stays competent with several commercially so called +p+ ammo reaching up to 1230fps. This round is being fired all day long from M92 today in military trainings and shootouts(left aside the XM9 trial days where 92s malfunctioned on low count rounds due to faulty slides and Marine using them extensively with Proof Loads exceeding 50,000psi) These stories are availble on the internet anyway. [/quote]\nI appologize for above information, actually i mixed up p1Z with p2Z ammo in POF 9mm brand. p2Z is infact rated on 1290+ fps and is obviously +p or even +p+. No doubt its the most powerful 9mm ammo available in Pakistan pricewise. Its more powerful than chinese norinco, russian wolf brand and american eagle ammo. \n\n[quote]@Skeeter60 Sir if you could please chronograph MkII loading for us Pakguns? and also weigh the supposedly 115grain loadings to proove against the data they have provided on their website? and also please confirm the availability of MKI. Have they merged both standard pistol and subgun ammo as one?[/quote]\nSkeeter sb are actually right.

Trigger, grips and accuracy rather dependent on the holder and sometimes are a matter of individual preference, capabilities etc etc.\n\nAbout some of the people in a disagreement about HKs & Sigs being prone to rust and wear of the exterior better take a look at my HKs & Sigs. One of the USPs is with a dealer and you are more than welcome to inspect corrosion on the slide, slide release and other nooks and crannies.\n\nSigs (recent models, older models had a k-kote finish) & HKs have a nitron finish on them making them rust resistant and not rust proof. Glock on the other hand comes with a tennifer finish. Teflon and tennifer are known to penetrate into metals giving them more strength and durability making their extrior rust proof. Tennifer again doesnt wear out that easily as compared to nitron or parkerization. In Pakistan these pistols come at such a high price most of us treat them as their children. Even the ones who carry regularly carefully take them out of the box , tuck them in a nice holster come back home and put them back into a box. Almost hundred percent of these pistols are scratchless. Some of us would even own a glock, hk or sig yet would carry a taurus, cougar or a chinese pistol for carry.\n\nThe handgun is actually put to test when carried by a the law enforcement or military people in a holster out in the open with virtually no maintainence which is when that weapon gets subjected to the goods & bads of weather and atmosphere. Even in Pakistan feel free to check a Glock & HK carried by a law enforcement of an army guy and you''ll see the difference. Not satisfied, those of you wh live near the sea, throw your Glock & HK or Sig under the seat of your car for a few months and you''ll see what Im talking about.

The USP is also a superior handgun in pretty much every way(except the trigger could use some work on it). I have seen them is extensive use personally. Glocks will tend to break the recoil rod and dont lock up properly (out of battery) if you dont take care of them (granted this is after extensive and careless firing).

If you consider bolt actions, there are very few bolt actions available in the resonable price range and are mostly available in .243 and 7mm. The most preferred is 7mm but have no clue why. There are 3 brands in the reasonable price range that i know of they being Parker Hale (Local assembled by GM Dosul but Barrel and Bolt are imported), BSA England (Local assembled by GM Dosul but Barrel and Bolt are imported) and the CZ Brno. \nPrices are as follows:\nParker Hale 7mm - 26k\nBSA England 7mm - 28k\nCZ Brno 7mm or .243 - 50k\nI have no idea about other brands but if you are considering a bolt action in the 100k range then the best bet you have is the CZ Brno considering its price, finishing and reliability. There are absolutely no issues with the Parker Hale and BSA, they are good for starters and are very good low budget rifles. The only problem that i came to know of, was that it is very difficult to put on a scope on them. The CZ on the other hand is a complete package. The ammo for 7mm costs around 185-200rs. per piece. I have no clue about the Grains for this bullet but the brand is Winchester, for ammo. Our member Sohail bhai has bought a CZ Brno and our member Moin bhai bought a Parker Hale or BSA.

There are 3 brands in the reasonable price range that i know of they being Parker Hale (Local assembled by GM Dosul but Barrel and Bolt are imported), BSA England (Local assembled by GM Dosul but Barrel and Bolt are imported) and the CZ Brno. \nPrices are as follows:\nParker Hale 7mm - 26k\nBSA England 7mm - 28k\nCZ Brno 7mm or .243 - 50k\nI have no idea about other brands but if you are considering a bolt action in the 100k range then the best bet you have is the CZ Brno considering its price, finishing and reliability. There are absolutely no issues with the Parker Hale and BSA, they are good for starters and are very good low budget rifles. The only problem that i came to know of, was that it is very difficult to put on a scope on them. The CZ on the other hand is a complete package. The ammo for 7mm costs around 185-200rs. per piece. I have no clue about the Grains for this bullet but the brand is Winchester, for ammo. Our member Sohail bhai has bought a CZ Brno and our member Moin bhai bought a Parker Hale or BSA. So they would be the best people to get a complete insight about these rifle''s.[/quote]\n\nThank you for the market sample.', ''),

(64372, ' The display of arms has gone from being a feudal practice to an urban status symbol. Hence it is no surprise that politicians, the affluent and other elites in Karachi are moving about the metropolis with heavily armed guards in plain clothes.\n\nSome of these gunmen are armed with sophisticated weapons that do not belong to the city streets. What is perhaps more disturbing is that the city’s police force appears to be reluctant to confront these individuals. The display of even licensed weapons by persons in plain clothes is not allowed under the law, unless approved by the home ministry. Yet such permission is generally not thought necessary as policemen do not want to risk ‘offending’ the person being guarded. No one is above the law and when the country’s precarious security situation is considered, no one should feel offended when asked to provide identification or legal documents, especially keeping in mind the lethal weapons in question.\n\nNevertheless, the need for armed guards for politicians and public figures who need extra security is justified. Karachi’s total sanctioned police force is 29,000 officers, which is wholly inadequate to provide protection to its citizens, let alone special security cover for public figures. But politicians and lawmakers should set an example. Is it not possible for their gunmen to conceal their weapons especially in public? Here we must look at security arrangements for public figures in foreign countries. Foreign security agents of various countries arguably do a much better job of protecting public figures than their Pakistani counterparts, and without brandishing heavy weapons in public. Discretion is the better part of valour. The scourge of guns in this city cannot be eliminated without public figures taking the lead. Maintaining personal security is one thing. Illegally displaying weapons to establish one’s status in society is quite another.\n\nSource: [url]http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/14-gun-culture-zj-03[/url]', ''),

Anything to check if the safety/ decocker works safely? Because if the decocker is faulty, it can result in a fatal accident...[/quote]\n\nbhai jan.. as far as 92 clone is concerned, when we push the safety DOWN in safe condition.. first of all the striker knob that comes between the firing pin and hammer rotates up, further pushing of safety lever presses the lever located on right side just between the grip and slide on the frame which releases the sear to bring hammer down. \nThis type of safety design is very safe indeed, there is left no physical connection between hammer and firepin as the striker knob(dont know the proper term Beretta use to define this feature) that lies between hammer and pin rotates and moves up... but yes fire-pin block can be a tricky thing as it functions intrenally. If you have your firepin changed or remade, make sure it is milled properly with all necessary cuts and grooves, as these cuts are responsible for the firepin block to function properly. This block rises up when you fully press the trigger and protrudes out the slide on a 92FS. As per design, copied glocks are more prone to failure regarding internal trigger related safeties. I have a copied SIGP226 which never failed on its decocking function, but one can imagine if decocking a copied SIG might put the hammer down all the way on the firepin instead of keeping it on a predefined constant distance. All safety features working properly in a clone also shows the over all quality and build of the particular firearm. I have seen NIB 92 clones whos firing pin block failed to move up upon pressing the trigger.', ''),

(64656, ' +1 Tareen, Exactly my thoughts.\n\n[quote=TAREEN]The display of arms has gone from being a feudal practice to an urban status symbol. Hence it is no surprise that politicians, the affluent and other elites in Karachi are moving about the metropolis with heavily armed guards in plain clothes.\n\nSome of these gunmen are armed with sophisticated weapons that do not belong to the city streets. What is perhaps more disturbing is that the city’s police force appears to be reluctant to confront these individuals. The display of even licensed weapons by persons in plain clothes is not allowed under the law, unless approved by the home ministry. Yet such permission is generally not thought necessary as policemen do not want to risk ‘offending’ the person being guarded. No one is above the law and when the country’s precarious security situation is considered, no one should feel offended when asked to provide identification or legal documents, especially keeping in mind the lethal weapons in question.\n\nNevertheless, the need for armed guards for politicians and public figures who need extra security is justified. Karachi’s total sanctioned police force is 29,000 officers, which is wholly inadequate to provide protection to its citizens, let alone special security cover for public figures. But politicians and lawmakers should set an example. Is it not possible for their gunmen to conceal their weapons especially in public? Here we must look at security arrangements for public figures in foreign countries. Foreign security agents of various countries arguably do a much better job of protecting public figures than their Pakistani counterparts, and without brandishing heavy weapons in public. Discretion is the better part of valour. The scourge of guns in this city cannot be eliminated without public figures taking the lead. Maintaining personal security is one thing. Illegally displaying weapons to establish one’s status in society is quite another.\n\nSource: [url]http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/14-gun-culture-zj-03[/url][/quote]', ''),

That''s the time we stood up and do you know the few first things we did, individually? Well, we both ran to get our five years old son up from the bed first, he was fast asleep. We got him outdoors.  Next, my wife went for the keys of the house and the car. And what do you think I was doing? Guessed it? Course, I was standing there before my closet! Watching what? My dear few things, that I got quickly hold of and ran outside too! I couldn''t leave my guns there, at NO cost, doesn''t matter what could have happened next few moments! Well, when things settled down few minutes later, somebody on the news channel reported the likelyhood of following aftershocks! And what did I do this time around? You may not have guessed it, but funny enough, I was busy checking my LICENSES, ensuring they were there in my briefcase! And out was that briefcase into my car-trunk, which was already parked securely. Honestly speaking, this was the first time in my life that I came to realize how dear my weaponry is to me, the only thing next in priority to my family!

(64759, ' [quote=Rabz1979]Ive always wondered what pistol would best suit women for carry & self defense.[/quote]\n\nI observe that far too often too many men presume women shouldn''t carry what the man himself is carrying.  It''s the male ego thing and one reason I prefer female students to men.  I think the man is wrong to presume that woman can''t carry what he might carrying.  I fully acknowledge that the unique women one man is thinking of may not be capable of carrying what he is carrying; but the broad brush should not be used.\n\nInstead, we should apply the same criterion for choosing a gun for a woman as we would for a man.  In no particular order, those criterion are:\n\n- size of hands\n- strength of forearms and wrists\n- sensitivity to recoil\n- desired caliber\n- desired capacity\n- method of carry/concealment\n\nOf these, the one that most dictates the gun is not size of hands, strength of forearm and wrists, or even sensitivity to recoil... which is what most people consider first, but instead it is [u][b]method of carry/concealment.[/b][/u]\n\nWomen tend to have wider hips and they abhore any method of dress that accents their hip girth.  You all well know that the best place to carry a gun is strong side, at hip level, but to do so increases hip girth.  When they cover the gun with clothing hip girth increases again.  The result is women often don''t wish to carry guns on their hips, they prefer a gun in a shoulder carried purse or bag. \n\nWhen they go to a firearm carried in a purse bag, it can (but not always) affect the size of the gun carried.  Usually the woman wishes to carry a smaller firearm which is lighter.  It weighs less, it doesn''t deform the shape of the purse or bag as badly.\n\nMy opinon is that [b][u]desired caliber[/u][/b] is largely irrelevent.  Any .380, 9mm, .357 Sig, .40 S&W or .45 auto cartridge will do.  From my readings on PakGuns it appears 9mm is most readily available and it works wonderfully in stopping a threat (I know).\n\nAlso for consideration are the .32 and .22lr.  I know I am a rebel when I suggest this.  But .22lr and .32 have been killing people for a respectable period of time.  More important than caliber is accuracy.  When the bullet is placed where it should be, threats are stopped.  Learn to shoot, the bullet will do it''s job.\n\n[u][b]Hand size[/b][/u] is important, but because an incorrect finger placement or inability to correctly place the trigger finger on the trigger is very detrimental.  We must consider handsize if our woman has unusually small hands.  So far I have not run into many women with hands so small that a Beretta, Glock, Sig, etc was too large for them.  Interestingly the 1911 is a nicely sized grip for most people.\n\n[u][b]Capacity[/b][/u] is of some concern, but only minorly and women must simply be ready to accept the reality that as they insist on more cartridges they must accept a large gun in some fashion and more weight.\n\nNow we get to the three concerns most men first think of when choosing a gun for a female: strength, hand size, and recoil sensitivity.\n\nWhile most men assume that women prefer 9mm to .40 or .45 due to [u][b]recoil sensitivity[/b][/u], my experience has shown me that women tend to prefer the .45''s push over the 9mm snap.  This is the result of what''s known as impulse.  9mm tend to achieve a higher velocity faster than the .45.  The length of the energy spike and it''s amplitude can be measured.  The 9mm tends to be a shorter higher graph than the .45''s logner, lower graph.   I know it is counter intuitive, but it is what I have observed and other instructors report as well.  Regardless, recoil is always subjective.  What we conclude on a board means nothing if the women shooting says, "I don''t like it."   \n\nOnly once have I encountered a woman who was so recoil sensitive she couldn''t shoot 9mm - .45.\n\nPlease also consider that as the gun get''s smaller and lighter, often it results in nasty recoil.  I returned a Glock 27 because it was simply too unpleasant to shoot.\n\nAnd, only once have I encountered a woman who lacked the [u][b]wrist/forearm strength[/b][/u] to handle 9mm - .45. Interestingly enough I have also encountered one male. Proper grip on the gun is more important than the strength of the hands.\n\nSo I can suggest the 1911 for many women, if you can find one in 9mm that''s even better.\n\n[quote]I own a glock 26 which I find very convinient, easy to shoot and handle and it fits my hands very well. As for the bigger pistols i cannot even manage to load them because the spring is soooo hard.[/quote]\n\nThe spring will loosen up over time.\n\n[quote]Is there a handgun in big bores which is better than a glock 26?[/quote]\n\nDefine better?', ''),

Weapon very affordable around 50K(NIB). Rounds from Rs 150 to Rs 200/=.\n     2: 7mm mag - Good for 300m - Weapon around 100K (used). Bullets around Rs 250/=.\n     3: 308 - Good for 300m - Weapon hard to find and expensive. Bullets around Rs 30/=.\n     4: 30-60 -  Good for 300m - Weapon and bullets both expensive.\n\n There may be other choices; i.e: .270 etc but not really much.

I was having hard time focuing on the sights after firing the second consecutive shot. sorta blurry, takes time to come back in full focus. since I instinctly open both eyes while aiming, I did what I do with shotguns, bring only the front sight back into focus and align with the target and forget the rear sight.\n\nand yes ur right about Baikal. its superb accuracy and lowest recoil (compared to the ones that i''ve experienced) actually makes ''shot following'' alot easier.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(65384, ' [url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s2.postimage.org/sjdfS.png[/img][/url]\n\nOriginally created by the U.S. Army to replace the 30-06, the .308 Winchester (7.62x51 in military form) ranks among the most versatile and popular centerfire cartridges in the world. The .308 serves police and military marksmen, Palma competitors, F-Class shooters, and deer-hunters equally well. The .308 Win delivers superb accuracy along with outstanding barrel life--it''s not unusual for a .308 barrel to return 5,000+ rounds of accurate service. Along with excellent factory-loaded ammo, a huge selection of bullets and powders is available for the .308 Winchester reloader. Loading for the .308 Win is relatively easy. The round is not finicky and great powder and projectile combinations are well-known.\n\nAnd if you want "out of the box" precision in a factory rifle, the .308 Win is hard to beat. While it may not be the "ulimate" 1000-yard cartridge or short-range paper-puncher, the .308 remains one of the best cartridges in the modern arsenal, with versatility that few other calibers can match. As a "do-it-all" cartridge that can take game, win shooting matches, and defend against foes, the .308 Winchester has few rivals.\n\n[b]Preferred Brass[/b]\n\nFor a 6BR, there is one clear choice in brass--Lapua, with Norma the only real second choice. For the .308 Winchester, choice of brass is not so simple. Most of the .308 Win precision shooters we''ve interviewed do prefer Lapua brass, but others are very happy with Norma, Winchester, Hornady Match and even Remington. Black Hills uses Winchester-made brass for its match ammo, which is capable of .5 MOA or better in many rifles. The main advantage of Lapua brass is consistency and quality. Case-wall thickness is very uniform and most lots have shown less variation in weight than other headstamps. But Winchester brass performs very well in the .308. And, at $24/100, Winchester costs 40% less than Lapua brass. Even if you can potentially get more loadings out of a Lapua case, Winchester brass offers more bang for the buck. You''ll find a lot of once-fired Federal Gold Medal Match brass available. While it tends to shoot accurately, we''ve found GMM brass is relatively soft compared to Lapua or Winchester, so the primer pockets tend to loosen up after just three or four reloadings.\n\nIn addition to commercial brass, many .308 Win shooters reload boxer-primed military cases such as Lake City, IMI, and Hirtenberger. The Lake City Match brass is pretty good. Some lots have been excellent. The standard Lake City fodder is inferior to Winchester. IMI brass has a reputation for being strong, but we advise you only to purchase it new. Some used lots of IMI brass from Israel have been defective. If you are looking for ultimate accuracy, IMI will probably disappoint you, though it''s good for gas guns that are tough on cases.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about military brass is that the internal capacity will probably be less than commercial .308 Win brass, because military brass often has thicker webs or casewalls. Montana Marine reports his fire-formed milsurp cases hold 56 grains of H20 on average compared to 58 grains for fire-formed Winchester. Given the reduced capacity of military brass, you should reduce posted max loads by 1.5 grains when loading with Lake City or most other milsurp brass. However, the IMI MATCH brass is closer to commercial brass in internal case capacity (ICC). Kevin Beggs reports: "Fired, my IMI Match brass runs with an ICC of 55.0gr and bumping the shoulder back .001" will net me an ICC average of 54.0gr. LAPUA runs an average of 54.4gr and Federal runs an average of 54.3gr ICC."\n\n[b]Match Bullets[/b]\n\nWhat you see below is just a fraction of the quality 30-caliber match bullets available to .308 shooters. Figure there are at least twenty projectiles you might consider. Still, with such a large selection, nearly all the competitors we interviewed were using one of five bullets: 155 Berger, 155 Lapua Scenar, 155 Sierra MK, 168 Sierra MK, or 175 Sierra MK. A few guys have had good luck with the 168gr Amax (.475 BC), and some guys like to shoot the heavy 185gr Bergers (.569 BC), 185gr Scenars (.521 BC), or 190gr SMKs (.533 BC) at 1000 yards, but the vast majority of .308 shooters are running the 155s, or the 168 or 175 Sierras. Among the 155s, John Whidden has had great success with the Bergers seating them well in the lands. The Lapua 155 has an impressive .508 BC (and you can see that it is even longer than a 175 MK), and you can launch it much faster than a 168- or 175-grainer. Between the 168 SMK (.488 BC) and 175 SMK (.505 BC), most shooters seem to think the slippery 175 is a better bullet overall and it definitely has an edge at longer distance--less drop and less windage. We suggest, in developing initial loads for your .308, that you focus on one of these five projectiles, and then maybe try a few Amaxs or the heavier SMKs. Sierra will start selling a new 210gr SMK early next year. It''s probably a little heavy for a .308, but it should work very well in a 300WM or 30-06.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s1.postimage.org/YEdti.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Hunting Bullets[/b]\n\nThe major bullet manufacturers, Barnes, Hornady, Nosler, Sierra, Speer, and Swift provide a wide variety of hunting bullets in .308 caliber with weights ranging from 100 grains or so to 240 grains. For smaller game and varmints, the Sierra 110gr Varminter bullet has proven very accurate. For deer-sized game, a bullet in the 150-grain range (such as the Swift Scirocco) running 2850+ fps is very effective. Reader M700 tells us: "Something that is deadly accurate and has fast expansion gets my vote for mid-longish range deer hunting. Say either a Nosler Ballistic Tip or a Sierra SPBT GameKing. Both have the reputation for fast expansion and excellent accuracy. With a decent .308 Win you can boot the 150 up to around 2900 fps and get excellent accuracy as well as deadly on-game performance." The Hornady 165gr SST, with its excellent .447 BC, is another good choice for longer-range shots on deer. For Elk and large game, select a heavier, controlled-expansion bullet such as the 180gr Nosler Partition.\n\n[b]Factory Loaded Match Ammo[/b]\n\nOne of the great things about the .308 Win is the availability of high-quality factory-loaded ammo. Using 168gr Federal Gold Medal Match this editor managed to coax a .75-moa group from a FAL clone with iron sights. Many shooters who don''t have the time to reload shoot GMM or Black Hills exclusively, and they hold their own in tactical competitions. Jacob Gottfredson, noted writer for Precision Shooting, told us that he often uses Black Hills match ammo in competition: "In tactical matches, an extra quarter-MOA of accuracy (from handloads) won''t make you a winner if you can''t range the targets and dope the wind. You could shoot 175gr Black Hills the whole match and easily end up with a trophy". Along with Federal and Black Hills, Lapua makes truly outstanding .308 match ammunition fitted with 155gr, 167gr, or 185gr Scenar bullets. The Lapua ammo is capable of shooting under half-MOA in a good rifle. It costs about $25.00 per box of 20 from Grafs.com. For great prices on Federal GMM ($16/20 for 168s) go to OutdoorMarksman.com.\n\nSo which factory ammo is the best? Chances are you should try Black Hills, Federal and Lapua and let your gun decide. SniperCentral.com recently conducted a Match Grade Ammo Comparison test, including M118 LR, used by U.S. military snipers. The tester concluded: "The Federal Gold Medal Match is still the standard by which all other match ammo is judged. How they can get such good accuracy and consistency from such mass produced ammo is a mystery to me. Black Hills match grade ammo is right up there with Federal, is just as consistent, and in my particular rifle, is just as accurate, though I cannot say its any MORE accurate than Federal. It''s a good alternative, with the price per box about $2 cheaper than Federal. The HSM ammo is the cheapest of them all by a large margin (about $5 cheaper then Black Hills, and about $7 cheaper then federal per box). But it''s also not nearly as accurate. You can expect the same accuracy as M118, and it makes a good replacement for those that cannot get M118."\n\n[b]Choosing the Right Powder and Load Testing[/b]\n\nFor the 160-175 grain boattails used by the majority of .308 shooters, you want a powder of medium burn rate that gives close to 100% load density. The "classic" .308 load for 168gr SMKs is IMR 4064 with Federal primers. However, these days Varget is probably slightly more popular. Lot variance has frustrated Varget users, however. Jerry Tierney has had to tweak his .308 Palma Varget load up to two full grains to maintain optimal velocity. Tech Note: If you use QuickLOAD, we suggest you select data for ADI 2208 rather than Hodgdon Varget. This, we''ve found, will give more realistic numbers.\n\nIn addition to Varget and IMR 4064, a half-dozen or more other powders work extremely well in the .308 case: AA 2460, BLC-2, IMR 4895, Reloader 15, Ramshot TAC, VV N150, and VV N540. Some folks are seeing a little more velocity with RL15 than with Varget, but Varget is still less temperature sensitive--important if you''re running near max. Most of the guys we know shooting the Sierra or Lapua 155s are using Varget. For Sierra''s 110gr Varminter and other light bullets, you can use a faster-burning powder such as Benchmark or VV N135. In general, the .308 seems to achieve its best accuracy with case-filling loads running pretty stout pressures. For safety''s sake, always start at least 10% below recommended maximums, and watch for pressure signs carefully. Often you can be over-pressure even without tell-tale signs on the primer cup. One trick we use is to take a shell-holder to the range. After firing a test case, if you have difficulty sliding it into the shell-holder, the web has expanded excessively, meaning your pressure is too high. For a good selection of "safe" loads, click on the Sierra icon to download Sierra''s .308 Winchester Load Map.\n\nWhen choosing a load to test, keep in mind that seating depths can make a HUGE difference in pressure. Remember that seating bullets into the lands can raise pressures but moving 0.020" or more AWAY from the lands can also raise pressures, because you are reducing the effective case capacity. Many readers ask us "should I jam or jump my bullets." There is no right answer for every gun. For every guy getting great results at .015" jam, there is another guy doing well with a 0.025" jump. In general, most popular .308 match bullets (Bergers excepted) are tolerant of jump. This is certainly true of the 168 and 175 SMKs. So don''t worry that you may be sacrificing a great deal of accuracy by loading to mag length, even if that puts you pretty far from the lands.\n\n[b]Primers[/b]\n\nWe wish we could say something definitive about primers--but the truth is both Federals and CCIs are winning their share of matches. Federal 210m, and CCI BR2s have both proven accurate with all the most popular propellants for match ammo. We can say that if you have experienced issues with cratering and primer piercing, go with the CCIs. They have a harder cup. Among other primers, WLRs are used in Black Hills match ammo and they perform admirably. Russian primers are the newest thing to hit the market, and by all indications they work as well or better than the best domestic primers (so long as the rather hard Russian cups are firmly seated to proper depth). Note, Russian primers are currently distributed by PMC and retailed in PMC boxes. However, PMC will not import them after the first of the year. AccurateShooter.com has been informed that a large, well-known foreign ammunition company will take over importation of the Russian primers and they should be readily available by the second quarter of 2006.\n\n[b]Reloading and Die Selection[/b]\n\nReloading for the .308 is straight-forward. The cartridge is very forgiving and performs exceptionally well with a wide variety of powders and bullets. Different applications require different tools and techniques, however. Those shooting semi-auto "gas guns" such as the M1A and FN-FAL clones should full-length size after each firing. Palma shooters, who need to be at near-max pressures to be competitive, should use the strongest brass available and should pay special attention to seating depths. At high pressures, Palma shooters can also benefit from body-sizing or full-length sizing after each firing.\n\nFull-length Sizing (Body and Neck): The problem with full-length sizing is that virtually all commercial dies reduce the neck diameter much more than necessary. This results in excessive neck tension and can make bullets difficult to seat smoothly. There are two good solutions to the problem, and neither is very expensive.\n\n1. Purchase a Forster .308 full-length sizing die. Measure a loaded round with a bullet seated, and note the outside neck diameter. Then send your die to Forster and for $10 (plus shipping) Forster will hone the neck to the dimension you specify. For bolt guns, we suggest .002" under the neck diameter of a loaded round. For gas guns, go .003" under. Total cost is about $45.00, including the die.\n\n2. Hornady can make you a custom full-length sizing die for about $75.00 plus shipping. Just send them a few fired cases and a reamer print (if you have it). They can create a die that gives you ideal neck tension, as well as just the right amount of sizing at the shoulder and web. Call Hornady and ask for Lonnie Hummel. Scott Parker recently had a die like this made and he reports: "Average runout for 65 rounds was .0004". All 65 rounds showed less than .001" runout."\n\nNeck Sizing Only: If you are not working your brass too much with very hot loads, you can probably get by with neck-sizing only. Bushing dies are convenient and allow you to adjust tension as easily as swapping in a new bushing, but this can contribute to build-up of brass at the neck-shoulder junction. If you do neck-size only, you should experiment with the bushing position. Some shooters get best results only sizing one-half to two-thirds of the neck. Another inexpensive option is the Lee Collet Die. This works by squeezing the neck around a metal mandrel that extends down into the case. Collet dies can produce very low run-out, they don''t cause brass build-up at the neck-shoulder junction, and they are inexpensive. However, it is somewhat difficult to precisely control the amount of tension and the collet''s fingers can leave marks on your brass. Still, some .308 shooters swear by the Lee die.\n\nNeck-Sizing with Optional Body Sizing: Most .308 shooters can get away with neck-sizing only for a while, but after 4-5 firings extraction becomes difficult. Then it''s time to size the brass. An inexpensive Redding body die is the way to go. Getting just the right amount of sizing is the hard part--you want to just size the case enough so that it feeds and extracts easily. With some presses, the ram must be set to "cam-over" in order to size the case enough. This means you must first set the bottom of the die to touch the shell-holder, then screw it down a little further, 1/8th turn at a time.\n\n[b]Barrel Length and Twist Rate[/b]\n\nYou''ll see a wide range of barrel lengths and twist rates on precision .308 Win rifles. At one end of the spectrum, a tactical shooter who needs a compact, quick-handling rifle, may select a 20" barrel. The popular Rem 700 LTR (Light Tactical Rifle) features a 20" fluted barrel. On the other hand, Palma shooters, who need to keep a 155-grain bullet supersonic at 1000 yards, normally opt for barrels 30-32" in length. The extra length also provide a longer sight radius--a big benefit when using iron sights. A shorter barrel definitely delivers less velocity, all other factors being equal. With most powder/bullet combinations, you can figure an additional 25-30 fps per inch going from 20 to 25 inches. From 25 to 30 inches, add an extra 17-20 fps. From 30-33 inches you may pick up 15-17 fps or so, with appropriate powders. \n\nA 1:10" twist rate will let you shoot the popular medium and heavy 30-caliber bullets up to the 210-grainers from Berger and Sierra (provided your barrel delivers enough velocity for the heavy bullets). A ten-twist can also work well with the lighter projectiles. John Whidden, who won the recent U.S. Palma Team Trials, has had great success shooting 155gr Bergers with a Broughton 10-twist 5C barrel. A 1:11" twist, found on many factory rifles, is a good compromise. Palma competitors using the Sierra or Lapua 155s have favored 1:12" or 1:13" twist rates, with the theory being that a slower twist rate may offer better velocity since there is less friction in the barrel. A 1:13" twist is fine for deer hunters who prefer a 150gr-class bullet moving 2850-2900 fps.\n\n[b][color=red].308 Win vs. 7.62x51--The Straight Scoop[/color][/b]\n\n[color=red]Before we go much further, we want to address the oft-posed question "Are the .308 Winchester and 7.62x51 NATO one and the same?" The simple answer is no. There are differences in chamber specs and maximum pressures. The SAMMI/CIP maximum pressure for the .308 Win cartridge is 62,000 psi, while the 7.62x51 max is 50,000 psi. Also, the headspace is slightly different. The .308 Win "Go Gauge" is 1.630" vs. 1.635" for the 7.62x51. The .308''s "No-Go" dimension is 1.634" vs. 1.6405" for a 7.62x51 "No Go" gauge. That said, it is normally fine to shoot quality 7.62x51 NATO ammo in a gun chambered for the .308 Winchester (though not all NATO ammo is identical). Clint McKee of Fulton Armory notes: "[N]obody makes 7.62mm (NATO) ammo that isn''t to the .308 ''headspace'' dimension spec. So 7.62mm ammo fits nicely into .308 chambers, as a rule." You CAN encounter problems going the other way, however. A commercial .308 Win round can exceed the max rated pressure for the 7.62x51. So, you should avoid putting full-power .308 Win rounds into military surplus rifles that have been designed for 50,000 psi max. For more information on this interesting topic, read the following articles: Gun Zone''s 30 Caliber FAQ; Cruffler.com Technical Trivia, June 2001; and last, but not least, Steve Redgwell''s .308 vs 7.62x51 Analysis, which really provides a definitive explanation. Reloaders should also note that military ammo often is made with a thicker web. Consequently the case capacity of 7.62x51 brass is usually less than that of commercial .308 brass. You may need to reduce recommended .308 Winchester loads by as much as 2 full grains, if you reload with military 7.62x51 brass, such as Lake City or IMI.[/color]\n\n[b]SOURCE:[/b] [url]http://www.6mmbr.com/308Win.html[/url]\n\nCartridge price 7.62x51 (G3) (KHI): Rs. 35 to Rs. 50', ''),

You will find that all current produced pistols have polymer guide rods, triggers, safety levers, hammer spring caps / lanyard loops, magazine bottom plates and followers." \n\n[u][b]End result of all research[/b][/u]\nIt''s not the rod you have to worry about, it''s the spring. As the spring wears and slowly loses its tension it absorbs less and less of the recoil. Which means that over time the frame of the gun has to absorb more and more recoil. This can eventually cause the frame to crack.\n\nbut Stoeger/Beretta have metal frame...it was, after all, designed for a .40 cal in the first place.\n\nBottom line...if you are going to carry a weapon for self defense, do youself a favor and do not intentionally make it unreliable by changing OEM parts with after-market" add-ons :/', ''),

The recognition of the right of private defence is simply a recognition of the importance of the instinct of self preservation for the well-being of human society. Self-defence is the nature''s oldest law. It is based on the law of necessity of self preservation. The right of self-defence conferred by section 96, P. P. C. is to the effect that every person has a right to hold his ground manfully and not to run away like a coward. The only consideration is that a person threatened with danger of injury should not exceed the limits fixed by the law. This, of course, depends upon reasonable apprehension of danger to the person under the particular circumstances of the case. It is reasonable apprehension of danger to the body and not the actual injuries received that should judge the justification of the act of the accused. The reasonableness of the apprehension is a question of fact which depends upon the weapon used, the manner of using it, the nature of assault or other surrounding circumstances. If people armed with lethal weapons were permitted to enter the abode of peaceful citizens to commit criminal trespass and at the same time occupants were not given complete right of defence to repel it with force, then it will tantamount to conceding to the law of jungle. The defiant and head-strong members of society will set at rampage and no body will be safe in his house and the very golden concept that one''s house is his castle will be destroyed. (End)\n\nExcept urs new questions, If any thing reg self defence is still missing, please let me know.

(65422, ' i think this detail may clear some confusion\n\n [b].222 Remington[/b] Invented in 1950 by Mike Walker of Remington, who also invented the famous Remington 700 rifle, the .222 was unusual in not being based on an existing cartridge but a totally fresh design. It''s excellent inherent accuracy led to it being extremely popular for decades as a bench rest round and a varminting cartridge. The .222 was eventually surpassed in 1975 by the 6mm PPC, a very popular bench rest cartridge, but although falling out of favour slightly, the .222 is still around. The .222 case provided the basis for the .223 Remington (which largely led to the .222 falling out of favour), the .221 Fireball and the new .204 Ruger. The .222 Remington typically fires a 55 grain bullet at 3,100 FPS generating 1,200 foot pounds energy.\n\n\n\n\n [b]5.45x39[/b]The 5.45x39 was introduced into service in 1974 for the new AK-74 assault rifle. Over the next few years it replaced the 7.62x39 cartridge as the standard Soviet assault weapon cartridge. The new bullets were lighter so the rifles produced less recoil allowing more accurate fire than the previous 7.62 bullets. The bullets in this cartridge are of unusual design. The main core of the bullet is made of mild steel with a copper jacket. Behind the pointed tip of the bullet is a small air gap with a small amount of lead covering the front of the steel core. Upon impact, the lead expands because of the steel core following it. This allows the bullet some grip and splits open the copper jacket allowing the core to penetrate the target. In 1987 a steel rod in the original 7N6 bullets was hardened to 60 HRC. In 1992 the size of the steel penetrator was increased and the lead plug in front of it discarded. This bullet was designated the 7N10 "improved penetration". In 1994 the 7N10 design was improved by filling the air space with lead. The 7N22 armour-piercing bullet, introduced in 1998, has a sharp-pointed steel penetrator and retaining the soft lead plug in the nose for jacket discarding. The recent 7N24 "super-armour-piercing" bullet has a penetrator made of tungsten carbide. Reloading supplies for 5.45x39 are generally not available and milsurp ammo is berdan primed and has a dark red lacquer sealing the bullet and the primer to waterproof the round. It typically propels a 56 grain bullet at 2,850 FPS giving 1,000 foot pounds energy.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsuF35i][img]http://s2.postimage.org/uF35i.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nFrom Left to Right\n .22-250 ,7.62x39 ,6mm PPC ,.204 Ruger ,.223 Ackley Improved ,[b].222 Remington[/b] ,.223 Remington ,[b]5.45x39[/b] ,.17 Remington ,.221 Remington Fireball ,.17 Remington Fireball ,.22 Hornet .', ''),

Aside from this safety LWD is also offering another safety button in the trigger, I feel that even this is excessive.  Reason, for safety was that in the mid 80s to early 90s many police officers in US - were in fact shooting themselves in the knee or foot because they were drawing the weapon with their finger on the trigger - and this was because prior to the Glock begining era most of the weapons on the market were or had the cocked and locked feature - called condition one.  Most officers carried S&W 645, Colts, and even the older Berettas with the safeties in the frames were condition one.  Ofcourse as with time and proper training this problem was cured somewhat and Glocks contribution to this was also things like the NY trigger, and ALL police models have the 8lbs trigger.  The factory civilian models have the 5lbs trigger, with the exception of G34, 17L, and other sporting models.', ''),
