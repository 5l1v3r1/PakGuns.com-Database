The gun was not grease-packed or anything, just wrapped up in a plastic bag and literally left to rot. \n\nWhen I got the gun, most of the bluing had worn off and the gun was in dire need of some TLC. I cleaned it up, took it to the farm, and loaded up 8 rounds of Chinese ammo from the 70s, which again wasn''t stored properly at all. Till then, I''ve fired approximately 300 rounds from it, without any failure whatsoever. I even fed it some really hot Prvi hollow points (rated at speeds in excess of 1550 fps, I think). \n\nIf it wasn''t so damn inaccurate, I''d actually be comfortable using it for SD.

For me decent at that range is sub 1 inch groups (and these were all 1.5-2 inch groups) I though maybe the strong winds were the culprit.

Because from what I know, if your weapon is not entered in your license (and the purchase receipt also not attached/stapled onto this page# 16), then it is not legal. So the entry is a must (from a legal point of view). Anyone who is telling you anything otherwise, is no doubt playing some sort of a silly game with you... So my advise is to avoid such a dealer.\n\nAlso note, that on page# 20 and 21 - There is also the ENDORSEMENT section of the license, which too needs to be filled. In this section there is the Registration# of the licensing authority, date, seal and signature of the licensing authority, post office registration #/date, post office (location), signature & seal of postmaster, police station registration #/date, police station (location) - And finally, the signature & seal of the SHO (police station house officer). So all these things need to be filled, in order to make the license 100% legal and valid.\n\nNow I am not a lawyer, so I can''t claim to know everything (which is why I am only going by common sense).

The Guard siiting ionfron the cam can watch the activities all around and also if any suspicious person coming close to your boundry can put a alert to the Guard.\n\nSecondly the most important is the alert of the intruder. Let it suppose that day you havent seen the intruder then what ?? Nowdays there is a very Cheap system in the market which is know by Home Security system which include Door sensors and Motion sensor . You can lock that system with the help of a remote while going to bed or leaving your house and if any Door sensor or Motion sensor ignites it will Buzz the Alarm and will Call you on your Priority number saved un the data base system.

So if there is some issue, then let them give you the reason in writing - What I mean is , please don''t believe in any hearsay... Go to the Deputy Commissioner''s office yourself (in person) and ask about the issue directly. No need to hand them your license, just inquire about what the real issue is.\n\nI had heard that because of the general elections, no firearms licenses were being issued in Sindh.

But after the elections, all that has now cleared (as far as I know).\n\nWhen I was getting my first license made, I too heard many stories from different people - In the end it was all nothing but *fluff*, deliberately created by all these so-called middlemen who supposedly knew better... In short, it was just another way to extract more money out of me.\n\nIt''s actually the same story when you get your passport made. You''ll find many people standing outside the very same passport office, telling you that if you get it made through them, then you''ll experience no difficulty - But guess what, if all your papers are already in order, then even if the person issuing the passport is your life long enemy, there is little he can do to keep you from getting yours...\n\nSo once again, I am advising you to please consult a good lawyer.

The only place in Karachi where you could find them, was in Agha''s Supermarket at Clifton. At that time only a few knew what an actual Pizza looked and tasted like. Anyway Agha''s Pizzas were really great, so I (and my Dog) became regular customers!\n\nAnd so this happy relationship continued for a few years, but suddenly in the early 1990s - Agha''s Supermarket stopped keeping those Pizzas. When I inquired to know the reason? They told me that those Pizzas were actually made at home by a parsi lady, (kind of like a hobby which would bring in a little extra cash too). But she (I was told) immigrated to Canada with her family. And so that''s how I lost a great tasting Pizza... :''(\n\nNow I had many sleepless nights, and whenever I could sleep, all I could dream about was that great tasting Pizza! But fortunately by 1992, satellite dish antennas had become very common over here, and so everybody was watching Star TV (and thus familiarizing themselves with western trends). So that''s how Pizza parlors started to open up everywhere like mushrooms!\n\nSo one day I got an ad tossed in my letterbox, of a new Pizza parlor which was very close to my house. It was called Mamamia Pizza, situated next to seaview apartments at the beach (where he half built Silver Sands building stands today). Best of all, they would home deliver it at no extra cost!\n\nNow I tried their product, and although it was not as good as the ones sold at Agha''s Supermarket, it still was a fine Pizza in it''s own right! So I (along with my Dog) became their regular customer! And so for over a year it continued like this - Until one day I ordered a Pizza, and discovered that instead of having a base of tomato paste, he this time became cheap and just put crushed tomatoes instead...\n\nSo I went to their shop and asked why they did such a horrible thing? To which the answer they gave me was: "Our costumers demanded that we now only use fresh tomatoes instead of canned paste". Now I wasn''t born yesterday. Therefore I instantly understood the price difference between picking bruised vegetables from the market at a throw away cost, and that of buying an imported can of real tomato paste... So this is how I stopped being their customer.\n\nNow I tried many more Pizza parlors that were opening up daily. But non of them could ever match the taste of the ones I got from Agha''s Supermarket. Until about a year later I heard of a place called Shakey''s Pizza, situated on the first floor of Crystal Court at Clifton Karachi. So I tried their Pizzas, and they sure did taste great!\n\nBut just as I had become their regular customer, Pizza Hut came to Pakistan (it was 1994 now). So I tried their product too - And by God it was horrible I swear... With the first bite their entire Pizza''s cheese would detach from the Pizza''s base and fall into the plate (creating a mess). And on top of this, it didn''t even taste good to me. So I (and my Dog) both said *laanat ho Pizza Hut pay*, and drove back to Shakey''s Pizza.\n\nHowever by now Shakey''s Pizza was facing very stiff competition from Pizza Hut. Shakey''s product was better, but Pizza Hut was backed by it''s huge marketing campaign. And so that''s how Shakey''s Pizza closed down in a few months time. Which sparked off my personal *dushmanee* with Pizza Hut!  :D\n\nAnyway, in my depression I tried may other local Pizzas to, but again, nothing tasted as good as the ones I use to eat at Agha''s Supermarket, and neither could anyone come close to Shakey''s Pizza... The twilight of my teenaged years was already upon me now (in the mid 1990s), So I one day took a chance, and in anger attempted to make my first Pizza at home!\n\nIt wasn''t too great, but it also wasn''t bad either. Nowhere near as good as the ones of Agha''s Supermarket or Shakey''s - But certainly better than what that idiot at Mamamia Pizza used to sell. And this was just my first attempt! best of all, I also realized that when I made Pizzas at home, they would cost me a quarter of what I used to pay! And so I continued to improve my Pizza, until I arrived at the same level of taste, as the ones of Agha''s and Shakey''s!\n\nAnd so I now dedicate these Pizzas of mine to that unknown Parsi lady who used to make Pizzas for Agha''s Supermarket, my beloved Dog and true partner in crime, and the fine people who used to own and operate Shakey''s Pizza at Clifton!  :D\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21438[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21439[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21440[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21441[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21442[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21443[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21444[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21445[/ATTACH]', 1, 0, '119.155.24.19', 6, 1, 8, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
(366309, 11471, 365769, 'casanova', 14427, '', 1369280444, '[QUOTE=Turumti;365769]Dear Zainulabdeen, \n\nThat is a very interesting story indeed. Since I am a falconer, i.e a person who hunts with falcons, and have been doing so for the last twenty five years, please allow me to shed some light on your post. My 2 cents as some would say. \n\nWhat you witnessed that day was actually a "barak" in progress. This trapping method has been around for centuries. However, its proper application is not as crude as what you saw. The birds usually used for barak are lugger falcons (lugger)and white eyed buzzards (chukki/kooee/teesa/tee''a).\n\nFalcons, like all other birds of prey and predators are very territorial, especially the bigger falcons such as peregrines and sakers. So they do not take kindly to intruders, and less so one who is flying around with a kill in its talons. \n\nSo what the trappers do (here I am describing what the traditional trappers and not what money blinded ignoramuses do),  is they first catch a lugger or a chukki in a net using a desert rat as bait.[COLOR=#00ff00] [/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000][B]Next they "seel" they birds eye using fine needle and thread. As cruel as it may sound, seeling, done right is a painless and harmless procedure.[/B][/COLOR][COLOR=#00ff00][/COLOR] The bird is first immobilised in the silken straight jacket, and its head is held by one man[COLOR=#ff0000][B] while another lifts up the outer eyelid (birds have an inner and an outer eyelid), and passes a fine needle with a silken thread just below the edge of the eyelid where there are no blood vessels or nerves, the needle is then taken over the bird''s head and the other eyelid is also pierced in the same manner, and then both ends of the the silk thread are drawn up, thus pulling up its eyelids and almost closing them.[/B] [/COLOR]A bird thus treated can see only in one direction, which is up. \n\n(Apart from trapping, seeling is also used by falconers, and nowadays, even by also by experienced avian vets in cases where birds need to be immobilised for treatment. A bird that cannot see, will sit absolutely calm, and therefore it less stressed, and thus less susceptible to hurting itself by crashing around, and due to immuno-suppression caused by stress.[B] [COLOR=#ff0000]Furthermore, seeling when done right, causes no bleeding, not even a single drop of blood, and to unseel a bird, all one needs to do is to spray some cool water on the bird''s eyes, then cut off the top knot with a scissor and slowly pull the thread out). [/COLOR][/B][COLOR=#ff0000]\n[/COLOR]\nSo returning to the topic at hand, once the bird''s eyes are seeled, a decoy locally known as a  "khuddu" is tied to the bird''s legs. This khuddu is usually made of a quail or dove''s skins dried and then stitched in the shape of a pouch, into which then  a ball made of cloth scraps is stuff in. Then nooses made of horse hair are stitched into this cloth ball. \n\nWith the "barak" thus prepared, the trapper hides in a blind not too different from our duck shooting blinds. All the time he scans the sky for a peregrine or saker falcon. The moment he spots one, he very quietly casts out the barak from a window in the blind. Now since the barak bird with its partially seeled eyes can only look up, it flies up.  Here on its entirely a matter of luck. If the falcon (the wild one) is not hungry or if he is just passing through, he will ignore the barak. But if that bird is local in that area, they it will at once swoop down to teach the intruder a lesson. Firstly, the barak has invaded the other''falcon''s territory, and secondly, it has killed in that territory, (thats what the khuddu hanging from its legs signifies), and thirdly, and worst of all, it is advertising, to all and sundry that it has ousted the other falcon from its territory, (as that is what flying around with a kill in its talons signifies). \n\nThis territorial behaviour is the undoing of the saker/peregrine as its first swoops down on the barak lugger to drive it out of the area, and then tries to take its kill (the khuddu) from it. The moment it does that, its talons get ensnared in the nooses, and both birds comes spiralling to the ground. \n\nNow if the trapper is traditional one, he will quickly entangle both the birds and inspect his catch, if it is a good young peregrine or saker he will keep it, if it is an adult bird he wuill release it as these are not preffered for falconry. Then  he will turn his attention to the barak bird. First he will untie the ball from its feet, then he will unseel its eyes, and let it rest in the shade for a while. Then in the late afternoon he will feed the bird and release it, for that is the unwritten rule of trapping. The decoy is always released after being fed a full crop. \n\nHowever, in this era of unbridled capitalism and blind pursuit of monetary wealth, most traditional vlues and ehtos have fallen by the wayside. 90% of the falcon trappers nowadays are just in it for the money. They are not even traditional trappers for the most part. Thus hey have no respect for these birds or any birds for that matter. \n\nThe blame for this sad state of affairs lies squarely on our governments right from Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the 1970''s to his illustrious son in law till a few months ago. The worst in this regard, however, were Zia-ul-Haq and Musharraf. The former started the business of allotting entire districts to visiting foreign "dignitaries" and barring local hunters from even setting foot in those areas, to the latter(Musharraf) in whose era, the issuance of falconry licences to Pakistani falconers was arbitrarily and indefinitely suspended. Both these rulers violated the fundamental rights of Pakistani citizens as guaranteed in the Constitution of Pakistan. \n\nThese actions have effectively killed falconry in Pakistan. Now only a handful of falconers remain, all them victims of apartheid in their own homeland.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThats great info turmuti saheb. i have many times saw some doctors/ surgeons who even are qualified , can not perform the dressing/ stitching of a wound and today i have come to know that we have such talented persons around that even perform stitching on the very little eyes of a bird perfectly , painlessly and without causing a single drop of bleeding .

Rather they should be doing opereration /surgeries in govt hospitals becuse in this way , they will get handsomely paid jobs and shall leave the evil practice of poaching too[/QUOTE]\n\nCasanova Sahib, \n\nI quite understand your concern, but the fact of the matter is that human''s eyes and bird''s eye are anatomically different. Bleeding, in any animal or bird only occurs when a blood vessel is punctured or severed, and pain only occurs if a nerve relays the signal to the brain. In the absence of a blood vessel being punctured or severed and a nerve not being activated, their will neither be any bleeding no will there be any pain. \n\nTo try this yourself, first prick your finger nail with a needle. Nothing will happen. No bleeding and no pain, because they are no blood vessels and no nerves. Now if you were to turn your finger and try it? The result would be be both bloody and paunful, because your finger, does have blood vessels and nerves in it. (Dont pricj you finger though, Im sure you know hav blood vessels and nerves there).', 1, 0, '182.178.61.32', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

They all make about 1.5 to twice (and in some cases even 3 times) the amount they would make working elsewhere. But the job also carries a great risk of injury.\n\nWhile I was there, I had the preconceived notion that the workers are not provided any safety gear (and thus are generally mistreated). But reality is that their entire store room is full of every type of safety equipment imaginable. From safety harnesses, to eye and breathing protection, to hard hats, thick leather gloves and aprons - Only the workers themselves chose not to use any of it. As the gear is heavy to wear, and so very hard to work with in the sweltering heat...\n\nAnother misconception that I had, was that the beach will be filthy due to all this shipbreaking - But I found seashells on the beach, meaning that the ocean is alive. The workers also catch their own fish from the sea early in the morning. There really was no stink in the air, and neither was there anything left over from the ships which would be sent to some landfill. Literally everything, and I really do mean EVERYTHING from a ship gets recycled. There really is no wastage at all!\n\nGadani ship breaking yards provide over 30% of steel to Pakistan at a very cheap rate. They all together pay almost five billion in tax annually too. But the advantages don''t stop there - As when you recycle metal (as in re-melt it to make something new), you only use about 15 to 20% of the energy than you would if you were making steel from iron ore (like the steel mill). So the nation''s coal reserves are not depleted, and so the impact on the environment is very small.\n\n[URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJYgNc_TNc[/URL]', 1, 0, '119.155.1.173', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

They all make about 1.5 to twice (and in some cases even 3 times) the amount they would make working elsewhere. But the job also carries a great risk of injury.\n\nWhile I was there, I had the preconceived notion that the workers are not provided any safety gear (and thus are generally mistreated). But reality is that their entire store room is full of every type of safety equipment imaginable. From safety harnesses, to eye and breathing protection, to hard hats, thick leather gloves and aprons - Only the workers themselves chose not to use any of it. As the gear is heavy to wear, and so very hard to work with in the sweltering heat...\n\nAnother misconception that I had, was that the beach will be filthy due to all this shipbreaking - But I found seashells on the beach, meaning that the ocean is alive. The workers also catch their own fish from the sea early in the morning. There really was no stink in the air, and neither was there anything left over from the ships which would be sent to some landfill. Literally everything, and I really do mean EVERYTHING from a ship gets recycled. There really is no wastage at all!\n\nGadani ship breaking yards provide over 30% of steel to Pakistan at a very cheap rate. They all together pay almost five billion in tax annually too. But the advantages don''t stop there - As when you recycle metal (as in re-melt it to make something new), you only use about 15 to 20% of the energy than you would if you were making steel from iron ore (like the steel mill). So the nation''s coal reserves are not depleted, and so the impact on the environment is very small.\n\n[URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJYgNc_TNc[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nyeah, all that but too bad for my friend who still couldn''t got married cause by the time he came back... she was already wedded to someone else.', 1, 1, '110.38.85.126', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(U should know the name/designation/and office block as well as floor on which he is situated) U also need your original CNIC. \n\nThen u ned to go to the home department. Show your cNIC again at the gate. Find out where the Home sec sits and hten convince his PA u need a meeting with the big man. Once u get the meeting.. U can then try and convince him that U need a firearms license. \n\nUsually a copy of your job letter and visiting card as well as a reason for a weapon.. that is all that is necessary. If u do convince him of your need for a fire arm. He will then issue u a paper which u wil then need to take to the DIG operations. \n\nGo and meet the PA of the DIG and convince him that u need to visit the great man.

Then it wil be the SSP operations and his PA. all the way down to the SHO of your area. He will then send an ASI to your home to verify your antecedents. usually the ASI wil also need CNIC copies of your neighbours as character certificates. U will then need to convince the ASI to write a good character certificate. \n\n\nOnce he does write it then it is his responsibility to give it to teh SHO whose responsibility it is then to write a favourable report for the Sp who wil then write a favourable report for the SSP Ops. who will then send a favourable report to the DIG operations. How htey write these reports is not your responsibility u can try visiting them and asking them to do it but that is it. \n\nThe DIG ops will the send the report to the Home Sec. U may try and keep visiting the home sec to know if they have received the favourable reports.. Once they do so. U wlil then be asked to give the fees i.e Rs. 4500 and then u will have to submit your data personally i.e photo wil be taken finger prints and personal data such as how much u earn and where etc etc. \nU will then be issued a token and will then need to visit repeatedly to know when your lic wil be ready.

Visit a reputed dealer, or make few friends on forums who can guide you to a reliable contact who deals in licenses.\n2. Apply for backdated manual DC license with 2 snaps and 1 copy of CNIC.\n3.

Visit a reputed dealer once again for computerization process, should cost anywhere 5 to 7k (may cost upto 10-11k if you have those HMQ/Wajid Sheikh licenses LOL)\n6. Expect your dealer to call you with in a week, visit HD for photos and data entry.\n7. Provide all accurate data this time, like address and etc... All corrections should be made here.\n8. Expect your license in few days after this process...\n\nAnd there, you have a good to go computerized HD license. (with rounds limit increased to 200 instead of 25/50 that comes default in DC licenses).\n\nI am waiting for my computerized licenses by Monday or anytime next week, after that I will try to have one made for all Pak (I assume that same HD licenses will stamped for all Pak, really dunno)...

But one advice that I have for everyone whenever videoing/filming or photographing, is to always be mindful of ambient light. Now this is not really a big issue when you are photographing an object indoors (as you can control the light''s direction and amount) - But in nature photography, this all of a sudden becomes a huge challenge (as thus a point of great annoyance if you get it wrong).\n\nNow we can learn all about professional photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop, but who nowadays has got the time to practice using such heavy programs. They also don''t come cheap (unless you steal them from the Internet, downloading as a torrent)...\n \nWhich is why I suggest IrfanView - A small and very quick basic photo editor that is also extremely easy to use. Best of all, it is totally for free (created by a Bosnian fellow in the late 1990s)! And so with this anyone can give their photos a professional looking feel, (by adjusting the light levels, tint, sharpness, and a few other things). All the pictures that I have shared over here so far have been processed through IrfanView. And it took just a few seconds on each picture.\n\nHere is the link:\n[URL]http://www.irfanview.com/[/URL]', 1, 0, '119.155.6.47', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

BUT the pricing [B]differences among the brands[/B] remains the [B]same[/B] as in the west... that is, a Honda is still an economy car no matter where you go, whether it starts at 20, 40, or 60k. Mercedes remains a premium brand that will cost 5 times as much, and a Ferrari is still a luxury that costs 10 times as much. Alternatively, [I]in Italy[/I], a Ferrari is STILL a luxury that costs 10 times as much as a Honda, with Mercedes in the middle... the price [B]ratio does not change[/B] much. The brand structure does not get turned upside down, the Honda doesnt become a luxury just because it is now an import and the Ferrari is a domestic product. No matter where you are, economy products are mass produced to a set cost, and luxury products are assembled with care using the best technology and materials... and their price differences should reflect that. When a product''s status changes, with no material difference (as Glock''s brand status and price position should be in line with Taurus, Caracal, Zigana, even Stoeger, but in Pakistan it has been promoted to luxury status, yet they remain physically the same as other Glocks) that is an interesting situation, that I feel is worthy of further insight.[/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 0, '24.85.141.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

In Japan 2 times more so but consistent sellers nonetheless. Price is not always indicative of quality. \nAverage buyer in pakistan(just like rest of the world) does not have all information to make the best educated decision. someone tells them Glocks are best or they see them in movies and they buy. Mac computers are another example where a product of equal specs priced much higher then competition consistently sell for more. Their advertising is just that good.\nSecondly the issue of scarcity plays a large role in determining the price of a product. In a completely free market dee beers would not be able to artificially control the production of diamonds. They do; In turn inject artificial scarcity and elevate prices of carbon molecules not much different then coal.\n Glocks are expensive not because they are 5 times better, but because they are 10 times harder to come by. This is bound to increase their value compared to a place where they are readily available. I can find a personal chauffeur for no more the 150 dollars per month because 20 gentleman in my immediate vicinity are without a job and readily available, unlike New York City where one will cost u no less then 3000 dollars a month\nThe market does not behave logically because all things are not equal.

It is suitable for the corrosion protection of electrical contacts in low-voltage engineering. Before spraying on electrical or electronic equipment, switch off the devices. The very high dielectric strength (UD=45KV/cm) also allows the application in connection with very sensitive (high-impedance) circuits. This property is particularly useful with electrical contacts and short circuits can be eliminated and prevented.

(367556, 10442, 323727, 'shahjee', 1900, '', 1369757464, 'Traditional pump-action and semi-automatic tactical shotguns share one serious shortcoming: They are slow to reload. Although they possess formidable short-range terminal performance, they hold a limited number of rounds. When those rounds are gone, the magazine takes a considerable amount of time to replenish. This is due to their feeding from a tube magazine.\n\nMagazine capacity is, of course, limited by tube length. Rounds need to be loaded one at a time, and under stress this can be agonizingly slow. In reality, loading a traditional shotgun is no faster than loading a French Mle. 1886 Lebel, and that was obsolete before World War I. Luckily, a tube full of 00 buck is all that&#8217;s required in a typical self-defense scenario. However, if you&#8217;ve ever longed for a tactical shotgun that was a bit more modern, there is one to consider. It&#8217;s the Saiga-12, and it&#8217;s a 12-gauge shotgun variation of the famous AK-47.\n\nSaiga, which means Steppe antelope, is a line of sporting firearms produced by Izhmash OJSC of Izhevsk, Russia. Izhmash OJSC is also a major producer of Russian small arms and the home of both the AK47 and the SVD. Izhevsk is also the adopted home of Mikhail Timofeevich Kalashnikov. The Saiga-12 is a semi-automatic, 12-gauge incarnation of Mikhail Kalashnikov&#8217;s legendary design. Better still, like the AK-47, the Saiga-12 feeds from detachable box magazines. Think about it. A semi-automatic, magazine-fed, 12-gauge AK. Some interesting possibilities for a fighting shotgun come to mind.\n\nThe man behind transforming the Kalashnikov into a shotgun was not Mikhail Kalashnikov, but another famous Russian designer, Gennady Nikolayevich Nikonov. Unlike Kalashnikov, Nikonov was actually born in Izhevsk, which is about 1,500 kilometers east of Moscow. Both his father and mother were employed by Izhmash, so it ran in his blood. His father worked as a mechanic at the huge facility, which employed tens of thousands. At the age of 18, Nikonov graduated from technical school. While there, he became obsessed with underwater rifles. He won his first professional recognition by designing a trigger mechanism for an underwater rifle. To further his education, he took evening classes while working at Izhmash. He graduated from the well-respected Izhevsk Mechanical Institute as a certified firearms engineer in 1975. After graduating, he went on to a post-graduate Ph.D course. He eventually married someone who could understand his work, another firearms designer named Tatiana. They had two sons, Nikolay and Yuri.\n\nNikonov began work at Izhmash in the Department of the Chief Arms Designer. His first position was as a technician. From 1980 to 1985 he worked on various projects for the Soviet Ministry of Defense. Not only the quality of his work, but also the amount he was able to perform helped him to advance up the work ladder. During his 30-plus-year career, Nikonov designed various rifles, air guns and sporting firearms. These ranged from a stylish, yet accurate Izjubr (Buck Deer) hunting carbine to a straight-pull, bolt-action biathlon competition rifle. Without a doubt, though, he is most famous in the West for his AN-94 assault rifle. Adopted in 1994 by the Russian army, this blowback-shifted, pulse-operated rifle is currently fielded by select Spetsnaz units. Of interest to us here, he also led the design team that created the Saiga series of AK-based shotguns. During his time at Izhmash, Nikonov received almost 50 designer&#8217;s certificates and patents. He was also awarded the titles of Best Designer of the Company and Best Designer of the Ministry.\n\nDuring a trip to Izhmash in 2001, I had the opportunity to meet with a member of his design team and discuss this interesting shotgun. Although at first glance the Saiga-12 appears very similar to a standard AK, it took a great deal of work to shoehorn a 12-gauge shotshell into the action. The heart of the piece remains a stamped sheetmetal receiver. However, it has a beefier trunnion. The most significant change in the Saiga is the gas system, which has settings to allow both low brass 2¾-inch shells and three-inch Magnums to be used with equal reliability. The gas piston on the bolt carrier has also been noticeably shortened. In addition, part of it has been machined away to allow shell clearance during ejection. The bolt has also been changed with the addition of a larger face. As expected, the topcover needed to be opened up to allow ejection of the big hulls. In conjunction with this, a simple sheetmetal shutter has been added to the recoil-spring assembly. This closes the rear of the ejection port when the bolt is forward in battery.\n\nProbably the greatest challenge facing the Russian designers was creating a reliable magazine. Reliable magazines for rimmed cartridges are notoriously difficult to design. Add the complication of feeding a flatnose shell and things become even more troublesome. Nikonov&#8217;s team solved the feeding problem by having shells go straight into the chamber. Magazine bodies are produced from a glass-fiber-reinforced polymer. Tough and sturdy with a metal reinforcement in the feed lips, the magazines fieldstrip easily for maintenance. Standard capacity is five rounds, although the Russians also produce an eight-rounder.\n\nAlthough the Russians do build tactical versions of the Saiga-12 with a pistol grip and side-folding stock, they are not legal to import, so Saiga-12s are imported as sporting guns. They have a sporting-type butt with no separate pistol grip, and the trigger mechanism is moved farther to the rear of the receiver. The butt and fore-end are made from a tough black polymer and fitted with narrow, 7/8-inch European-pattern sling swivels. Barrel lengths commonly seen are 19, 22 and 24 inches. Most of these have a fixed choke, usually full, although improved cylinder has also been offered. Some models were also available with external screw-on chokes. Both fixed and adjustable sights have been presented. A scope rail is fitted to the left side of the receiver. This allows a shooter to slide on a red dot sight or low-power scope when shooting slugs.\n\nBeing that it&#8217;s an AK-based design, it is not too difficult to legally convert a Saiga-12 into something more socially oriented. Currently, there are a number of good gunsmiths doing excellent work in this regard. Tony Rumore of Tromix, for example, is one I would highly recommend. For this article, I chose to look at a Saiga-12 converted by Marc Krebs of Krebs Custom.\n\nRead more: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/saiga-12-review/#ixzz2UbX29q9E[/url]', 1, 1, '182.178.136.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),
(367557, 10442, 356116, 'shahjee', 1900, '', 1369757527, 'The shotgun I reviewed started life as a standard Saiga-12 sporting shotgun. Krebs removed the factory firing mechanism, filled the holes and installed standard fire-control parts. A SAW-pattern pistol grip was added along with a standard fixed, military-type buttstock. To make the piece a bit handier, the heavy-wall barrel was shortened to 181/4 inches. Krebs then added one of his front sight assemblies to the barrel. This is held in place by two set screws. Robust ears on this unit protect a standard AR-type front sight. By utilizing a standard AR front sight, any of the commonly available aftermarket sights can be mounted. A very large-diameter aperture sight is mounted on the gas tube just ahead of the receiver. Diameter of the aperture is approximately 3/8 inch. Yes, it&#8217;s big and easy to pick up, either at speed or in low light. This sight is very fast on target when shooting shotshells, yet provides precision when firing slugs. The magazine release is the standard paddle type. The forearm is also the standard piece.\n\nThe result is a fairly short and handy shotgun with hardcore good looks. Overall length is just 363/4 inches. Balance point, with no magazine, is right at the bolt handle. With target loads and low-recoil LE buck and slug loads, it&#8217;s fairly pleasant to shoot. However, with full-house 00 buck or slug loads, the narrow military buttplate will not be denied its pound of flesh. A long day shooting heavy three-inch Magnums with this piece would not be at the top of my list of fun things to do. However, recoil is quite tolerable with 2¾-inch low-recoil 00 buck and slugs. Controllability is also quite good. The only problem is that those short, five-round magazines run dry way too quickly.\n\nThere are options to the standard Russian five-round magazines. AGP offers a 10-round magazine for the Saiga-12. Manufactured  in the U.S., this magazine is made from a robust glass-filled nylon. Made in separate halves that are screwed together, the body is also fitted with metal feed lips. At almost 11 inches long and more than three inches wide, these are big mags. They are actually bigger than the gun&#8217;s receiver. I purchased one of the very early production magazines and have been running it for almost two years. Reliability has been very good, but I did run into some problems after I had about 500 rounds through it. The follower became a bit sluggish coming up the last couple of inches. A little sanding cured that. ProMag also offers polymer five- and 10-round box magazines. The 10-round mag in particular has become popular among 3-Gun competitors. Suggested retail for the five-round mag is $26, while the 10-round design sells for $43.\n\nThe one thing you have to be aware of with the Saiga-12 is that a fully loaded magazine can be fairly difficult to lock into place. Loading down one round cures this, so I make a habit of only loading nine rounds in AGP magazines. Another thing to be aware of is that the front of the plastic shotshells can distort due to spring pressure. This can happen to the top round in the magazine if it&#8217;s left stored in the gun for a month or more. Basically, the heavy spring pressure driving the shell against the bolt deforms the plastic. I have seen shells deformed to the point where they wouldn&#8217;t chamber. Ammunition brand may play a part in this, but I think it is just the nature of plastic shotshells. The easiest cure is to simply not leave a loaded AGP magazine locked into your Saiga-12 for extended lengths of time. If you do, I highly recommend downloading it to eight rounds and frequently checking the top round for distortion.\n\nAnother option is drum magazines. These offer higher capacity over standard box magazines. The downsides are bulk and weight. However, for pure sex appeal and fun on the range, a 20-round drum in a 12 gauge is hard to beat. MD Arms offers a 20-round drum that weighs two pounds empty. It is available with a black, clear or smoke back cover. This design has three moving parts and only 15 parts total. It retails for $120. ProMag offers a similar design in two capacities, 20 and 12 rounds. As to be expected, the 12-round drum is quite a bit handier when locked into the gun. Both models have clear backplates to easily keep track of remaining rounds. The 20-round model retails for $124. The 12-round model retails for $99. One last option is Alliance Armament, which offers not only a 20-round drum but also a 30-round design. Very different from the previously mentioned designs, the Alliance Armament drums are open on the sides. They are also very expensive. The 20-round model retails for $379, while the 30-round drum retails for a whopping $425.\n\nAnother avenue one can take with the Saiga-12 is very old-school: all-brass shotshells. Brass shotshells will not deform in the same manner as conventional plastic hulls, so they might be the ticket for a magazine that will be left loaded and locked in to the gun long term. The problem, of course, is that no one currently offers modern 00 buckshot and slug loads in all-brass cases. There is no reason to let this deter you, however. Magtech offers brand-new empty brass 12-gauge shotshells for reloading. These are intended for Cowboy Action shooters, but don&#8217;t let that put you off. RCBS offers its Cowboy Brass Shotshell Die, which is specifically made for reloading brass shotshells. Better still, it&#8217;s designed to work in a standard reloading press. If you currently load pistol or rifle ammunition, you can load brass shotshells. Smokeless powder data is a bit hard to come by, but all components are readily available. Both Magtech&#8217;s hulls and RCBS&#8217; die set are available from MidwayUSA.\n\nOther than the problem stated, standard plastic shotshell performance is quite acceptable. Shells load into the magazines with little effort, and once you get the hang of it, magazines lock easily into the rifle if you load down one round. Pulling back the bolt and releasing it chambers one of the big shells smoothly. That still surprises me. Squeezing the trigger five times as fast as you can puts five empty hulls in the air. Cycle time is very fast, with empties being thrown five to 15 feet to the forward right depending on the load and gas port setting. Keep in mind, you do have an adjustable gas port. For best performance, run it on the lowest setting that will reliably function.\n\nHow does the Krebs-modified Saiga-12 pattern? To find out, I posted a large piece of cardboard at 15 yards. This is a practical distance for a shotgun intended for self-protection inside the home. Most encounters are likely to take place at this distance or much closer. Ammunition utilized for patterning was Federal&#8217;s Power-Shok 2¾-inch buffered 00 buck load. Five rounds were fired with measurements taken after each round. Performance was quite acceptable from this 12-pellet load. Average spread at 15 yards was 10 inches, and the patterns were very uniform in density. Switching to Wolf Performance Ammunition&#8217;s 2¾-inch one-ounce slug load, I tried my hand at 50 yards. Four five-shot groups averaged a respectable 4.9 inches. Recoil was fairly stout, though, thanks to the narrow buttplate.\n\nLately, there have been a lot of rumors circulating that the BATFE was going to halt the importation of Saiga shotguns. The worry here is that they were going to declare that the Saiga-12 was not a sporting gun. This was likely stirred up by the sudden surge of high-capacity drum magazines. While this has not happened, it is a worry that has certainly stimulated current sales.\n\nThe Krebs Custom-modified Saiga-12 is a very interesting gun with some excellent features. While it won&#8217;t win any beauty contests, it is extremely robust. When fed from AGP magazines downloaded to nine rounds, there are a lot of rounds on tap. Reloading is quick and easy. Controllability depends entirely on load selection. Full-house buckshot and slug loads pound on both ends. Low-recoil LE loads, on the other hand, are very controllable. Bred from the most reliable assault rifle in the world, it is an impressive-looking shotgun. Is it perfect? No. Mags will always be the weak point of this design due to the rimmed shotshells. Plus, in my experience the Saiga-12 is less tolerant than a 7.62x39mm gun regarding lubrication. However, properly lubed with good mags and low-recoil buckshot loads, the Saiga-12 is an impressive piece. If you are in the market for a tactical shotgun, the Saiga-12 is worth a look.\n\nRead more: [url]http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/saiga-12-review/#ixzz2UbXEqnZ4[/url]', 1, 1, '182.178.136.30', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Not only has that made me sad :( it made me even sadder to see those great guns sitting around while others could be enjoying them. \n\nThere is also the security risk factor of having too many expensive guns lying around while I''m not in town and me having the pain in  the neck of cleaning the entire lot every 6 months. Cleaning, maintaining and oiling about 50 guns is not fun when you''re in town for a short time.  \n\nI recently sold the Ruger Mark III, the Tac Ops and the Dan Wesson. I did not really have any use for the cash and thought I would do a little guns vs investment experiment. Through fundamental and technical analysis I identified Silver as having the most upside potential in the next 12 months (I had initially identified Tesla but bad timing made it run away from me) so I sold the guns for 150,000 (Ruger) + 250,000 (Tac Ops) + 200,000 (DW) = Rs. 600,000.\n\nWith Rs. 600,000 cash in hand I converted it to USD at the exchange rate of Rs. 100 to get $ 6000 handed back to me which I brought with me to Dubai. Here I did some research on the brands of Silver available locally, buying locations, storage etc. I went with the biggest Silver dealer in Dubai and with the Spot rate at USD 22.4 today placed an order. \n\nThere is a premium between spot rate and actual physical Silver. i.e the worldwide Silver price might be 22.4 but if I want to buy actual Silver Bars it would cost me $ 2/3 over spot. Apparently the market is so down these days that the bullion dealer himself told me not to buy right now as the market might go down further and I could buy the same thing much cheaper in the coming months. I was comfortable with the price and went ahead with the purchase as I can hold indefinitely and I have no hurry to encash.\n\nI had $ 6000 x 3.65 (USD to AED fixed exchange rate) = 21,900 AED in hand and with the doom and gloom scenario in the market I could ask the dealer for a discount in premium over spot. We finally agreed on a $ 1.2 price over spot. That made for a price of AED 2760 per KG Bar (approx 80 Pakistani Tolas). The market price today was AED 2915.\n\nFor AED 21,900 / 2760 I got 8, 1 KG Silver Bars minted by Emirates Gold (which are the most demanded/popular bars in UAE).

That certainly is an excellent reference which really helped me, but the only point I''d agree on giving up the idea of AK74 being NPB is its barrel length which is exactly 16.3 inches :) But once again its "[B]federal[/B]" notification and after 18th amendment, I think the powers divided among proviences weren''t limited to generation of electricity, but also last time I heard they get to define their own arm policies. And once again the weapons are sold on calibers, here in Sindh on NPB licenses is clearly written that this license is valid for all NPB calibers except .222 and .223, and to obtain one of those calibers you need to have one of those letters that are now being made here in our province :)  and so far what idea I have gained here is that other provinces aren''t even issuing any such letters for those calibers.\n\nAnother point to note is that in federal notificaiton, All shotguns (semi-auto or pump) having tube or magzine capacity of more than 4 shots are PB :D now where does that leave us bro? hahahahah... So, lets get back to start but this time try something different: "Hey I want to buy Akdal MK1919 or Hatsan MP-A (very reputed and budget shotguns, list may vary ofcourse)" and some one gets back to me with "Akdal has magzine capacity of 5+1 and Hatsan or any other Tube-feed shotgun has capacity of 7+1 or 8+1" therefore according to Federal notifications, they are [B]PB[/B]. But I do own one of those on my NPB license :-) ...\n\nNow we take about resemblence, take a look at lucky star market and you will find heaps of shops filled with heaps of .30sss with "more than" resemblence to AK47, MP5 and etc...\n\nAnother thing that I am not the only one who has this idea, actually its our group who have the same thinking but looks like no one wants to come forward and speak alongside here on forums, :-) I never even knew if AK74 was .222 until some of my friendsss from PakGuns told me about it, and now it seems I am the only one standing for it...

So back to those .22 rifles I mentioned above, produced by Walther and imported by our dealers :) are actually [COLOR=#ff0000]advertised and sold as replicas of those well-known [B]PB[/B] weapons[/COLOR] like MP5 and M4 Carbines... These were the imported replicas I mentioned :) Then there are all those LOCAL .30in/7.62mm replicas being sold out there, and we are buying these for our guards and etc... Believe me some of they even exceed maximum barrel length to fall in pistol category BUT they do are considered as pistols...\n\nThen comes PISTOLs, well there is nothing much but all those extended and drum magz also fall in PB and several of us enjoy keeping those.\n\nSo I mean I refuse to accept that if there is a this SEMI-AUTOMATIC weapon, which you are allowed to purchase by government of Sindh on your NPB license...[COLOR=#ff0000] Even if the letter does [B]NOT [/B]say "semi-automatic", does it rather mention "bolt action" [B]???[/B][/COLOR] So to my understanding if the wording "bolt-action" is not mentioned, it clearly means any .222 weapon can be bought...

It is difficult to shoot with magnum airguns accurately (except 54) unless and until a proper lube tune is made.13.  48, 52 and 54 models'' springs have relatively short life.  The spring break after approximately 6000 pellets fired.14.  There are even better springs available in the USA market15.  The best Tuning kit (Spring+ Guides) is made by JM Maccari which costs around 80$.  This spring and guide makes Diana 54 and any other Diana gun much more smooth and easy to shoot.  Also these springs do not break.16.  For airguns, only airgun rated scopes should be used.17.  Hawke scope are also considered good for airguns.  AGS Cobalt from Webley is also a good option.18.  Always keep your scope optically centered to achieve best results and to enhance the scope life.19.  Never use mineral based oils or mineral based grease in internals of airguns20.  Peep sight is one of the best options if you want some other means (other than scope and open sight) to shoot accurately.21.  Never fire an airgun without a pellet.22. If a magnum airgun is fired without a pellet,  the gun may be ruined and may never be repaired.23.  For short range, match type Wad cutter  pellets work fine.  For long range Dome shape is good for hunting.24.  Crosman Premier is one of the best low cost pelletsRegards,Umair Bhaur[/QUOTE]for all new members of this forum.', 1, 0, '182.178.8.159', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I liked the weapon then - its feel and shot groups were very good and was told that it was for only I think 40000/rs.  I put it on the back burner of things to buy.  Over this period of time, Abbas kept his Piranha and fired it till recently when I found out that over 15000 rounds had been fired through it already and the gun never showed any signs of wear.  Anyways, I borrowed the gun and gave it a slight trigger job.  I noticed that the gun was just as much fun to shoot as the TS single handed.  Furthermore it was shooting well with entry level shooters - they were dropping plates at 25meters with this gun the first time around.  I have yet to see someone do that with my TS even.  This is a lot to say.  I personally used Abbas''s gun and fired about 6000 rounds of S&B and REFUSED to clean it - just touching the muzzle of the gun meant black hands.  Needless to say, the gun shot VERY accurately always and it NEVER jammed on me.  Then the dreaded day came when Abbas bhai wanted his gun back :-(.  After cleaning it for over two hours I gave the gun back.  Since then I have been looking for it.  It was not available in Lahore, karachi, and Pindi.  Then I started to look in Peshawar, didn''t see it there.  Finally a dealer traced it down for me.  Why, this gun shoots great, accurately great, don''t believe me?  Be my guest at the Gclub.  For the past four months, I had stopped using my CZ TS (used it only once or twice), rather I was always taking the Piranha to range.\nBuy the gun... or wait for my video and then look for it...

Quite a fascinating bird to look at and to hunt with. It has got the heart of a lion, very aggressive, very fast on the wing and will often chase and bring down prey much larger than itself. Often they hunt in pairs. Its the only BoP I kept that remained aggressive towards me and while I had her my hands always sported the ''love bites'' she left ;) I''ve only seen one Turumti (who belonged to a friend) who wouldn''t bite otherwise they all seem to carry this nasty habit of biting and footing the falconer. We''ve flown Turumtis on a wide array of quarry including (but not limited to) quails, maynah, cuckoo, partridges, lapwings, pigeons and they tend to do well on whatever they''re flown upon. There''s this local legend of an old falconer who flew a cast of Turumtis (flying them in a pair, or more) and brought down a Kite with em. Our PG''s Mr. Turumti has kept many over the years and he will surely be able to tell you all what I''ve missed here. But in my limited years of falconry this bird has been able to super impress me with what she has to offer in such a small package :).

The thing is you never know their full intentions and if you comply and have the wait and see kind of attitude then quite often it is too late and suicidal to respond if things start to go south. Basically its kind of like : I expect the BAD guys to do GOOD things and only cash/ mobile/ car is what they want.  \n\nSo hope for the best and prepare for the worst.[/QUOTE]\n\nBro, its not that I am willing to contend here but its just a usual difference of opinion here... In my opinion, There are several prospects of owning a gun apart from fun and target shooting, biggest of them is right to Self-defense and defense of others around you. \n\nAs far as we are living in city of Karachi, such incidients are inevitable because the city of lights is actually a land full of scapegoats where criminal elements abuse its civilans to fund their wars for known and recognized terrorist organizations like BRA, BLA and TTP. Trust me, if @EDs car would have entered those No-Go areas of Liyari :) Apne namaz parh laine thi gari ki...\n\nSecondly, its NOT that I am "pro-shooting-no-matter-what" type of person; Actually I have 2 cellphones for the purpose, so if I have to go nearby for smaller errands on bike, I carry cheaper one with me, I don''t carry wallet with me except needed amount of cash in my pockets and I certainly do NOT carry weapon on me! This means when I am going out like this, the mobile and any valuable thing in my pockets are actually "AMAANAT" of these BGs which I have all intentions to give up...\n\nBut when I am out there "properly", especially when I have my family with me... I keep a loaded gun with me with all intentions to shoot if escape through speeding by dodging and/or bumping is not possible. I don''t know if you have ever been in such situation in car but if its time of night and/or the vicinity is not really crowded which usually is during day time THEN trust me then will actually PULL YOUR OVER, even they are only after valuables or mobile and not the car; they will and search everything... And just imagine if they find a weapon on you in such case, everything will start to fall south wards on its own :| \n\nI request you to NEVER expect good things from BAD guys, not all of them are of same kind... Especially when you are out there with females on board, there are several heard and known cases of kidnappings during the simple car or mobile snatching crimes. May Allah (SWT) forbid such incidents and keep all of us from any harm of any kind.\n\nTherefore if I am out there with GUN, then its totally because I am willing to use it unless its avoidable through proper and safe escape. I don''t carry GUN with me to offer it as a gift to them when they are looting me, or I don''t carry GUN on me to just make them mad. Also if I am carry GUN on me and I have all rights of defense then why appreciate these BGs to let them loot you for once, and trust me they will feel appreciated and try to do it again and again with you, your family and others....\n\nOnce again prospects of owning guns gives you COMPLETE right to defense of your self, your property either movable or non-movable and as well as defense of others around you.\n\n[QUOTE][B]96.

So when he wanted to take video footage of some of his shooting  endeavors and found it difficult &#8212; as one would imagine &#8212; to hold both  his iPhone and gun at the same time, he came up with a solution.\n\nWithin just a few weeks [URL="http://inteliscopes.com/"]Inteliscope[/URL], which combines a mount and app, was born.\n\nThe Inteliscope system allows users to shoot video from the rifleman&#8217;s  perspective with a digital zoom of up to five times the usual distance  at a resolution that Giddings said is an improvement upon most  smartphones&#8217; quality.\n\nHere are some of the other features built into the app:\n\nBallistics and Firearm Data[/*]Built-in Compass[/*]GPS Position[/*]Local  Prevailing Winds[/*]Shot Timer[/*]Flashlight and Strobe using Built-in  LED[/*]\n[/list]\nWhat&#8217;s more, he pointed out the system comes with a set of  customizable crosshair options since &#8220;everyone has their own preference  in scopes.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;One thing folks are getting really excited about is the ability to  shoot around the corner,&#8221; Giddings said, explaining that the screen  would display the target while the firearm was held around the corner.  &#8220;It will let you not be in the line of fire from a bad guy on the other  side.&#8221;\n\nAlthough some of the capabilities of the Inteliscope app are [URL="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/16/guess-how-demand-is-going-for-that-rifle-with-the-tech-that-makes-it-difficult-to-miss-a-shot/"]similar to those in the TrackingPoint system[/URL],  a &#8220;smart rifle&#8221; that claims to make it nearly impossible to miss a shot  and has gotten a lot of media attention of late, Giddings said his  system is a little less advanced but much more affordable.\n\nThe TrackingPoint system costs thousands of dollars, while Intelliscope retails for $69.99.\n\n&#8220;We are trying to build an inexpensive device so that everyone can have  access to it,&#8221; Giddings said, noting it isn&#8217;t intended to compete with  TrackingPoint, which is a whole rifle system, including the firearm,  that is designed for shooting at a further distance.\n\nEven Giddings said he would like to have a TrackingPoint system, calling  it &#8220;amazing,&#8221; but that it just isn&#8217;t feasible for everyone.\n\n&#8220;Our system is intended for tactical shooting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[TrackingPoint] has a very niche following.&#8221;\n\nTaking only about seven weeks from the idea&#8217;s conception to sending out  the first generation of the products beginning in June, Gidding&#8217;s said  he was able to move so quickly with the technology due to his  established engineering company and other contacts he had in the  software field already.\n\nGiddings said he anticipates a software update once a month to continue  improving the technology and user experience. He added they have already  begun development of a mount with built-in shock absorbers for use on  rifles that are more than .308 in size &#8212; the traditional smartphone  mount is good for smaller rifles.\n\nAlthough only available for iPhone and iPod at this time, Inteliscope is  working on an Android version due to demand and expects to have it  ready within a month.\n\nThe system can be used on any firearm with a Picatinny (Mil-STD-1913) or Weaver tactical rail.\n\nCheck out more about the [URL="http://inteliscopes.com/"]Intelliscope[/URL] system on its website.\n\n[video]http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=128_1370018567[/video]', 1, 0, '115.186.124.137', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

If you want to run it in a competition like IDPA having a shorter barrel makes it much easier to manoeuvre and manipulate the rifle around. Also in my own personal experience even a 7.5 inched AR-15 can shoot out to 300 yards without a magnified optic very accurately. There is not much advantaged gained when you''re moving from 16 to 18inches of barrel. If you move to 20 then yes there is more advantage gained. A 14.5 inched AR is just as accurate as an 18inch AR within the 300 yard range and rarely are you going to take it past that range. The .223 round is built for CQB scenarios within a range of 400 yards, although an 18 inch barrel is more accurate than its shorter counterparts but only slightly and it makes the rifle heavy and hard to manipulate in competition. Which is why Im trying to find shorter Barrels for the PAR MK3 but the authorised distributors refuse to import even an extra 14.5inch barrel for me. If ANYONE knows someone who could get me a 14.5 or less barrel for the PAR MK3 id greatly appreciate it, id even buy them lunch!\n  The affective range of a handgun and that of a rifle round, the controllability of a rifle and a handgun and the lethality of the round of a handgun and a rifle.

Umair bhai was kind enough to bring the moly grease and silicone based grease as we failed to find tar grease. Before opening up we chronied the gun using Crosman pellets and it averaged 925 fps. Opening it up wasn''t a big deal and it took us 20 odd mins to disassemble it. \r\n\r\nI think I wont exaggerate if I say that every one was mighty impressed with the gun''s internals, the machine work and especially the mainspring, which showed little signs of fatigue and wear despite having shot over 2700-2800 pellets through it. Everything was well finished and of good quality. \r\n\r\nSo Umair bhai was kind enough to work on the internals and deburred the cylinder cleaned the internals the mainspring etc while khilji made a washer to be inserted in the cylinder. Mr. Turumti was busy giving valuable advises and repairing his home made slingshot hahaha :p (which he later put to good use ;) ) anyways after all the internals were cleaned they were lubed  and it was time to put the gun back together; and that''s where it got tricky lol the trigger assembly was new to us all and as a result it took us at least 3 hours to figure stuff out and put it back together ;) and while at it a small screw type pin which connected the cocking arm to the anti-bear trap broke. Thankfully we were in good hands and Khilji quickly made another one and we were back in action :D. Finally it was all done and what I expected to take a couple of hours took more than 6 but the gun was finally in place. \r\n\r\nSadly there wasn''t enough light to check the gun on chrony again so we just settled on some test shots. I''ll mount the scope and shoot the gun today to see how has it changed. Hopefully its shot cycle and recoil are to improve considerably.

Since the force required to move the firing pin block out of the way is always perpendicular to inertial force if dropped barrel first, there is "almost no chance" of both them activating at the same time. \r\n\r\nSo, IMHO, whether the hammer is cocked, half-cocked or uncocked, and whether the safety is engaged or not, the fact of the matter remains that there is always a chance AD in a gun that does not have a FPB if dropped.\r\n\r\nRegards.', 1, 1, '182.185.58.149', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

It is simpler, with less safeties and moving parts. Its ammunition is smaller and lighter, this makes it easier to ship and for individual soldiers to carry more ammo. It has less recoil and a shooter can get a follow &#8211;up shot off faster as well. As far as the ammunition debate, that will have to wait till my next article.

Your first handgun MUST have external manual safety... Its actually a clip within reach of your thumb to engage or disengage manual trigger safety.  This is a feature you will find in Stoeger Cougar.\n\n2. Your first handgun MUST also have a decocker... It is necessary that once you load a mag in your gun and rack the slide, the modern DA/SA pistols will go in Single-Action mode as soon as you rack the slide. In SA mode, only very little amount of trigger pull is required to discharge a round therefore its not viable to carry it cocked (unless your gun has rare "cocked and locked" functionality).\n\nOnce again ofcourse Cougar also comes with decocker! \n\n3. Your first handgun SHOULD have external hammer... this way you can better understand and visually see if your gun is in cocked mode and even if your handgun doesn''t have decocker, an external hammer will let you decock manually (not recommended). Also some times when round fails to fire, with external hammer you can hit the primer with firing pin again easily by cocking hammer again with your thumb while in striker-fired guns you cannot continue shooting unless you eject that round.\n\n4. You first handgun SHOULD have drop safety... So if there is a live round in chamber and gun falls on a hard surface like concrete a handgun may discharge round :) therefore even I own one, I will not recommend Caracal F.\n\n\nThen there are other aspects like either you prefer guns with alloy/metal frame or polymer frames...

This is a feature you will find in Stoeger Cougar.\n\n2. Your first handgun MUST also have a decocker... It is necessary that once you load a mag in your gun and rack the slide, the modern DA/SA pistols will go in Single-Action mode as soon as you rack the slide. In SA mode, only very little amount of trigger pull is required to discharge a round therefore its not viable to carry it cocked (unless your gun has rare "cocked and locked" functionality).\n\nOnce again ofcourse Cougar also comes with decocker! \n\n3. Your first handgun SHOULD have external hammer... this way you can better understand and visually see if your gun is in cocked mode and even if your handgun doesn''t have decocker, an external hammer will let you decock manually (not recommended). Also some times when round fails to fire, with external hammer you can hit the primer with firing pin again easily by cocking hammer again with your thumb while in striker-fired guns you cannot continue shooting unless you eject that round.\n\n4. You first handgun SHOULD have drop safety... So if there is a live round in chamber and gun falls on a hard surface like concrete a handgun may discharge round :) therefore even I own one, I will not recommend Caracal F.\n\n\nThen there are other aspects like either you prefer guns with alloy/metal frame or polymer frames... Ability to conceal carry and etc... I am sure Steoger Cougar will come upto your expectations![/QUOTE]\n\nGood advise Tatur1 bro. I do agree with your advise and second you. But don''t agree with your suggested handgun(Stoegar Cougar). This is the only gun in Pakistan that i don''t like. There are much better options then Cougar. However i like the options Glock 19 bro mentioned. I also love S&W M&P 9 pro, Cz duty  and G19 itself......', 1, 1, '182.189.29.46', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Besides the balance and feel of the PT92 and Beretta 92FS is exactly the same.[/QUOTE]\n\nFirst of all from your post (#18), after reading its quite clear to me that you do agree where its about stoeger''s reliability however you have troubles on your personal preferences... to be honest bro I don''t think we should let that be any sort of factor in decision making of some one else. In my posts I quoted and explained reliability, cycling, accuracy and features on stoeger despite of my personal opinions like wither is beautiful or ugly, or I like the sound or not... In my personal opinion, Cougar is a classical beautiful handgun that works really well! You may also have rails option (the one that I own) and having even empty rails add dozen more points to its beauty! I also never even mentioned rotating barrel feature of Stoeger but it definitely contributes to its accuracy but still I agree to what you said that guns with rotating barrel work as good as these :)\n\n#20... yes bro indeed, but I never compared PT 92 with Stoeger... actually 92 is a full frame pistol :) while cougar is a normal sized firearm. I did knew Taurus makes PT92/99 of course but when I mentioned Turkey vs. Brazil, I also knew that there are SEVERAL other models of firearms produced by taurus, not limited to 92 alone. \n\nI kept my focus of Stoeger because the name is specified in the post # 1 from thread starter :)\n\nPlease I request you guys that don''t let personal preferences be any kind of factor here like if one doesn''t like Turkey or Turkish guns or shape/design of a gun then let it be, but its not a valid argument :D Now, suppose if our friend here goes to market, prior to purchase he takes cougar in his hands, tries to make a grip... if it doesn''t fit in his fist then definitely cougar is NOT the gun for him :) this all depends on the person him self...

As a result the place is now empty, some portion is always empty where the trucks and the labor doesn''t works.\n\nSo I decided to use the place as a shooting range. Although the place is fine in terms of safety and no one lives nearby the place so its fine for shooting plus the bullet wont obviously make it through to the mountains. Currently this is a temporary set up and it has no targets neither any other thing related to a shooting range or tactical shooting stuff. But tactical shooting can still be practiced there but again I don''t have any proper targets. \nI use empty glass bottles only to practice some target shooting there. I have though to make a proper set up in a another area on the farm and I can get as many truck loads of sand as I want to make a thick sand wall.\n\nI am working to make a shooting range somewhere at the farm and hopefully in near future I will come up with something good but obviously it won''t be state of the art.\n\nRecently I visited the farm and had a brief shooting session as well with my friends.\n\nBelow are the pictures of the place.\n\nThis is the place''s bird view...\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21531[/ATTACH]\n\nThe actual place looks like this.

In my understanding scope height is the distance between the surface of your receiver and scope tube''s center. I calculate it as follows: Distance between the receiver surface and scope main body + 1/2 of your scope''s tube dia (scopes come in two common diameters i.e. 1 inch and 30mm) which comes to 1/2 inch or 15mm.\n\nWhich pellets did you use for the aforementioned shoot?! If you used any pellets other than FTTs then chairgun''s readings will be out, as each type of pellet has a different BC and leaves the muzzle at a different velocity.\n\nNow, chairgun uses "average" BCs of the pellets and its readings CAN BE OFF esp when we''re talking about distances exceeding 50yards. The reasons are several and as you pointed out, the shape of pellet, wind, change in shooting shooting stance etc are a few to name. As the distance increases the differences become more pronounced. \n\nAlso, most of the readings given in chairgun are based on a standard scope magnification of 10x (until otherwise stated) and therefore the differences become visible as you alter the scope''s magnification. The reason being that the scope reticle is in a different plane and as you change magnification the "POA shifts". \n\nTo curtail this issues etched reticle FFP scopes are there (fixed focal plane) and the reticle is etched on a glass surface instead of a wire reticle; but these are expensive scopes and I''m not aware of an airgun rated FFP, etched scope. I have used a 1/2 mil-dot etched reticle scope on my airgun and while it was very accurate it had its short comings, 1) its reticle was very fine and since it wasn''t illuminated it was very difficult to use on high contrast subjects and in low light & 2) It broke after staying put for about 500 odd shots :p.', 1, 0, '110.37.16.38', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I am of course a resident of Clifton & Seaview Beach, which is the most popular beach of Pakistan (attracting many millions of visitors each year). Now this is a very safe and shallow beach. You can walk 50 feet into the ocean, and the water level will rise only about a foot. The waves too are not very big (as the breakwater of the Karachi harbor is also providing shelter to my beach).\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21767[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Seaview Beach of DHA Karachi (at twilight). [/B][B]The most calm and safe beach.\n[/B][/SIZE]\nHowever last year I got to visit Karachi''s Hawks Bay beach (which is technically outside the city limits, towards the west).\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21768[/ATTACH]\n\nNow this beach is indeed a very dangerous and steep one. As here you can walk just 10 feet forward, and the water level may rise to 7 or even 9 feet! The waves here are also huge! Which is why during every Monsoon Season, this entire beach is closed for swimmers. You are still allowed to visit, just don''t get into the water (unless you happen to be suicidal)...\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21769[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Waves pounding the huts at the Hawks Bay beach.[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21770[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Another hut (belonging to the Air Force) getting pounded by waves.[/B]\n[/SIZE]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21771[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]A large surprise wave, which brought seawater over the road.

Anyway, they were all very welcoming - And even gave me a free class in aquatic rescue, as well as a tour of their Headquarters! So all these pictures are from my visit. It was not yet high tide, still the pictures turned out OK (and the weather too was partly cloudy, and thus not mercilessly hot)...\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21775[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Mr. Miraj Khan, Chief of the Hawks Bay Beach Rescue Center.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nNow here I must mention that these people who daily risk their lives to keep the public safe, are actually treated very badly by everyone... These days there is a ban on swimming in the ocean, as the Monsoon season sea is just too rough! And this beach is known for extremely dangerous riptides (as well as some very sharp rocks just under the waves). \n\nBut the public doesn''t listen, instead these lifeguards are regularly hearing extremely vulgar swear words from the public, as well as an occasional tight slap from some [B]fat aunty[/B] who wants to get into the water with her piglets...\n\nChief Miraj Khan said that he once even had an SMG (sub machine gun) put on his temple by some Air Force officer who objected to Chief Miraj doing his duty... The police also (on paper at least) is suppose to assist these lifeguards in keeping the public safe. But they regularly charge a 200 to 300 Rupees bribe, and so allow anyone to get into the water - However when any fatality occurs due to these issues, it is always the lifeguards who get the blame for everything...\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21776[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]He is one of the longest serving lifeguards on this beach.[/B][/SIZE][B] [SIZE=2]On duty since 1997, and he says that he too gets slapped [/SIZE][/B][SIZE=2][B]by the ladies regularly (who object when told to stay out of the water)... In his own words: "They say that [/B][B]if you kill one person, it is like killing all of humanity. But [/B][B]if you save a life, then you have in effect saved all of humanity! [/B][B]So I just except the slaps as part of my day, as my main focus is saving lives" (he says with sarcasm) - How however has saved over 400+ people from death. So he indeed is a worthy candidate for some kind of presidential award. But as usual, he mostly receives a slap for doing his duty...

(370008, 11634, 370007, 'S-H', 15645, '', 1370833863, 'These lifeguards say one thing very clearly to you, that (God forbid) if you are swept away in these dangerous waters, we our not too well equipped to do much. So be mindful of that if you chose to ignore our advice and warning signs. Even the retrieval of dead bodies is not an easy task over here (as bodies often get stick in the rocks). One such person got swept away by the waves and drowned, and so his body got trapped in one of the 100s of underwater caves. They could not get the body out as it was too tightly jammed. So next morning they got all the heavy duty equipment, and so they bore a hole from the top of the rocks to get the body out. They started their work at 10:00 in the morning, and by 24:00 in the night, they were able to reach to the body - However by this time, the body had swollen up a lot, so the hole which they had dug, was no longer wide enough to get the body out. Therefore they asked for permission from the dead person''s father, to cut the body in parts (as that was the only way for them to get the body out).\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21777[/ATTACH]\n\n[B][SIZE=2]This is the hole from which the body was recovered, see water [/SIZE][/B][B][SIZE=2]gushing out from it as the waves come in. This is just one such [/SIZE][/B][B][SIZE=2]trap we know of, there are actually 100s of others in this area.[/SIZE][/B]\n\nPermission was given, but only after a total emotional breakdown of the victim''s father... So the lifeguards say that you please avoid being a part of an accident like this - Please listen to us and don''t get into the water during this season. As the sea is too rough. Also don''t try to be a hero in case you see someone drowning - Just call is, our emergency number is 16 (which can easily be dialed by any mobile phone also). \n\n\nChief Miraj then tells of another case, where a group of collage kids were picnicking over the rocks. Suddenly they saw a local boy who slipped while trying to catch some fish. The boy who had slipped was a local, so he knew the territory well. Therefore he found a stable place between the rocks where he was safe until he got rescued. But the 2 picnicking collage kids who had jumped into the water to save him, were both killed. One of those 2 young men was the grandson of Dr. A. Q. Khan (father of our Nuclear Weapon''s program)... His body was found 16 hours later, swept away into the harbor.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21778[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]This board in the lifeguard center clearly shows how [/B][/SIZE][SIZE=2][B]many people were rescued and how many died.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nWhile giving me a tour as well as teaching all about aquatic rescue - The team got an emergency call, so they were ready to swing into action! But it turned out to be out of their 17 kilometer jurisdiction. This drowning occurred near the Manora side (near PNS Himalaya). And since the person was now presumed dead, Chief Miraj said that he will now only go if called for assistance in the search for the body - Otherwise he would like to avoid it, as that is the Navy''s territory - So to do anything we first have to deposit our CNIC in one office of the Navy, then get into another office from where we would get our written permission to assist in the rescue, and so face even more Naval bureaucracy (with checking at every few yards), while the person who needs rescue drowns...\n\nThere are other problems too. Take this safety sign board for example (says the Chief). Now it''s one thing to ignore it, but totally another to steal it... Actually, it''s frame is made from thin steel angle irons - Which people often steal to sell as scrap iron... The lifeguard tower also (at the Paradise Point) is very badly vandalized. Where local people have stolen it''s steps, probably to use as firewood.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21779[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Newly made warning signs, soon to be stolen (when no one will be looking).[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21780[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]See the missing steps of the staircase of this Lifeguard tower.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nInside their briefing room, Chief Miraj explains that there is nothing more costly then a human life. So to save it, we will leave nothing to chance. He said that we once had 5 inflatable boats (in 2005). But one by one, they all got wasted with time. Their rubber actually decays as it ages. But they lost the majority of their boats due to damage sustained when they were called to assist in the Hyderabad floods. Their advantage is that they can work in shallow waters. But at the same time their disadvantage is that they are prone to damage by sharp objects (as they have a soft bottom). Therefore now they have just one boat of fiberglass left.\n\nOther things which the lifeguards use also don''t come cheap. One flotation device is like a soft tube, which the lifeguard can tie around an unconscious victim, and drag him or her to safety. While the other one is made from a very hard plastic, which a conscious victim can hold onto as the lifeguard pulls him or her to shore.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21781[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Soft flotation device costs 17,000 Rupees.[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21782[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Hard flotation device costs about 12,000 Rupees.[/B][/SIZE]\n\nThese however are not the only issues, they also don''t have any motor vehicles other than a fire truck which they use to deploy their lifeguards on duty (while on other hard to reach areas the lifeguards have to walk on their own to get to their post). So a few ATVs (all terrain vehicles) would be great. They also don''t have an Ambulance, and neither a doctor at their station. Which is why they can only provide first aid. They also urgently require jet skis, but each one will cost them about 2 million rupees!\n \nAnother thing which they have requested the government for, is a body locating sonar. Cost of this is around 10,000 US dollars (a little under a million Rupees). Every well established lifeguard station in the developed world (like in North America, Europe, South Africa, and Australia) has this - But over here the Ministry of Defense is keeping them from getting this. They fear that this is a sensitive piece of equipment, which if stolen and/or misused, will easily be able to detect our Navy''s underwater secret activity...\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21783[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]This is all what is currently available in their first aid room.[/B][/SIZE]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21784[/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=2][B]Bluebottle is the biggest threat to swimmers these days.\n[/B][/SIZE]\nIn our society, we today have become so obnoxiously and disgustingly vulgar - That we would spend 2.5 million Rupees on a cow which will be sacrificed on Eid, (to show off our vast resources). But won''t even give a single Rupee to the victims of the recent floods, furthermore, we will also not do anything that will prevent a tragedy... Which is why, whosoever now reads this, please think of making a donation to these Heroic Lifeguards of Hawks Bay beach of Karachi - And for God''s sake, don''t swear at them, or slap them, (nor spit at them), and kindly don''t threaten them with your guns! As they are only there to save your life, by unselfishly putting their own at risk!\n\n[B]NOTE:[/B] When I asked Chief Miraj on what if I can have these flotation devices made for him in Karachi at a fraction of the cost? He said that please do, if anyone can do such a thing, please get in touch with us. \n\nNow I of course also know what the reality over here is like, which is that there will be a lot of bureaucracy and red tape which will not allow me to do this - So the easy and workable idea is to simply donate equipment to them (like floating jackets, or small inflatable rubber boats)! This way they will get it instantly, and so without any delay - You may indirectly end up saving many lives!\n\nSo is anyone over here man enough to donate equipment to these heroes? The time for the month of Ramzan (and thus Zakat) is drawing close. So I ask again, is there anyone man enough to do what is right? Their door is also always kept open for anyone who is ready to volunteer and devote some of their time, like say a doctor... Therefore I again ask, is there anyone man enough?\n\nNow I must say that in all of Karachi (which is a city of over 20 million people now), you are not likely to find a finer gentleman then Mr. Miraj Khan, Chief of Hawks Bay aquatic rescue center! And by the way, if anyone ever wants to volunteer as a lifeguard also, their doors are always open - Just prove to them that you are a good swimmer!\n\n[COLOR=#333333]Continuing this story in my next post...[/COLOR]', 1, 0, '119.155.14.190', 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0);

As a result the place is now empty, some portion is always empty where the trucks and the labor doesn''t works.\n\nSo I decided to use the place as a shooting range. Although the place is fine in terms of safety and no one lives nearby the place so its fine for shooting plus the bullet wont obviously make it through to the mountains. Currently this is a temporary set up and it has no targets neither any other thing related to a shooting range or tactical shooting stuff. But tactical shooting can still be practiced there but again I don''t have any proper targets. \nI use empty glass bottles only to practice some target shooting there. I have though to make a proper set up in a another area on the farm and I can get as many truck loads of sand as I want to make a thick sand wall.\n\nI am working to make a shooting range somewhere at the farm and hopefully in near future I will come up with something good but obviously it won''t be state of the art.\n\nRecently I visited the farm and had a brief shooting session as well with my friends.\n\nBelow are the pictures of the place.\n\nThis is the place''s bird view...\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21531[/ATTACH]\n\nThe actual place looks like this. I use this wall as the place where targets are placed.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21532[/ATTACH]\n\nYou can see the soft sand right ahead of the person in blue shalwar kameez. That is the area where I place the bottles.\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21533[/ATTACH]\n\nA friend shooting the bottle targets...\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21534[/ATTACH]\n\nWell this is me, just for some show off lol :rockon:\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21535[/ATTACH]\n\nThis is a temporary place although I appreciate input from fellow members about how to improve this place. I know I need the targets the ones which are used in ASCC and Airmen Club and I will get them made soon. Hopefully when I get some free time I will spend a couple of days at the farm and make a somewhat better range...SOON INSHA''ALLAH!!![/quote]', 1, 0, '182.185.172.190', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

But it died at its inception, partly cause I did not have any forum to write on or attract funds. \n\nThese people are chronically understaffed and under funded. \n\nA brainstorming session seems like a nice idea.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nYes, a brainstorming session is a must now... And here I would also like to thank the owners as well as the moderators of PakGuns - For giving us a free platform to talk about such issues. So thanks to this, we all can now email the link of this thread to anyone - Even to the Prime Minister!\n\nOK, now back at doing some brainstorming... When I was there (with these lifeguards), it was for only a few hours - So all that you see written by me here, is probably just the tip of the iceberg. Because the truth is that these people do far more than what we can see at first glance. They do all that is possible to save lives, and in the process also regularly get stung by Jellyfish and Bluebottles.\n\nAt their center they will also (provided that they have time) give you a free class in aquatic rescue - As they believe in making people aware, because that in the long run leads to less mishaps. Yet the most unfortunate thing is that the government doesn''t even bother to provide them with fresh drinking water at their center... So this I feel is EXTREMELY unfair!\n\nSecondly, I also feel very bad how our own people visiting the beach mistreat them regularly. This is totally uncalled for, as no one has the right to slap anyone in public... Chief Miraj Khan is in reality exactly like the the character of Mitch Buchannon (played by actor David Hasselhoff) in the hit TV show Baywatch. Only Mitch Buchannon was fiction, while Chief Miraj Khan is for real! So a little bit of respect for these brave men should be the first order of the day!\n\nAnd so thinking on these lines, I propose that we somehow recommend these lifeguards for a Presidential Award.

But since he didn''t know another profession, he stuck with fishing (in the hope that one day the sea will provide him with riches). So one time in the evening he went out in his boat again, far beyond the horizon, baited his hook - And threw his fishing line over the side.\n\nSuddenly there was a very strong tug on his line. So he instantly started to reel it in. Whatever he had caught was indeed big, as he had to fight it really hard  - But once he brought it over the boat and had a good look at his catch, he was astonished to have caught a real Mermaid!\n\nNow he knew that all his troubles would come to an end - But just as he started to row back towards land, the Mermaid begged him for mercy. Realizing that she would also talk blew him away at first, be he said that if he released her, he will forever remain poor. He had been waiting his entire life for such a prize from the sea - So how can he let her go now?\n\nSo the Mermaid said that if he lets her go, she will grant him a wish - Anything that his heart desired, she will do it instantly! Therefore the fisherman thought for a while, and then remembered that if there is anything which he desires more than wealth, is to somehow put an end to his wife''s piercing taunts about the size of his (you know what)...\n\nSo he at once ordered the Mermaid, to make it so, that whenever he stood up straight, his (you know what) be touching the floor - That''s how long he wanted to have it!!!\n\nThe Mermaid gave him a strange and slightly puzzled look, but said OK, granted! Now will you please let me go? So the fisherman threw the Mermaid back into the ocean.

To calculate the vigour of the members here. Because I was in the start told by a member to share something about guns too, as this is PakGuns after all...

It actually look a 3 minute search with Google, and I came upon this page:\n\n[URL]http://www.pakdocs.com/honours-and-awards-policy/[/URL]\n\nSo the story of these lifeguards can easily be forwarded to anyone of our newly elected parliamentarians and senators.

But did anyone over here even try???\n\nTo conclude this thread, I would now just like to mention something which our [B]Dr. A. Q. Khan[/B] himself wrote in one of his articles. [B]When little stories are big Random thoughts[/B], published on 31st May 2010.\n\nRead the full article here: [URL]http://draqkhan.com.pk/?p=937[/URL]\n\n[B]" [/B][I]The obstacle in our path.\n[/I][I]\nIn ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king&#8217;s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along, carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picket up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition!\n[/I]\n[I](In 1976, when we were acquiring the site for the nuclear plant, we used to go to Kahuta regularly, park the army jeep at the entrance, where Gate No 1 now is, and walk to wherever work was going on. There were no roads there at the time, only footpaths through the fields. Like the king in the story, which I did not know until then, I wanted to test people and placed a big stone right in the middle of the main path. For three or four weeks nobody removed the stone and a new path was forming around it. I then removed the stone myself, remarking to Gen Zahid Ali Akbar, then a brigadier who was in charge of civil works, that this clearly illustrated the calibre of the people we had to work with to make an atom bomb. If I had read the story, I might have thought of putting a wallet with some money under the stone.)[/I] [B]"[/B]', 1, 1, '119.155.19.219', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

The .22LR is for size and dimension reference. \n[ATTACH=CONFIG]21866[/ATTACH]\n\n[B][U].22 Hornet [/U][/B]\nThe .22 Hornet is a vermin, small-game and predator centerfire rifle cartridge. This makes it hand loadable and reloadable, and thus much more versatile. It was the smallest commercially available .22 caliber centerfire cartridge until the introduction of the FN 5.7x28mm. The Hornet''s virtual absence of recoil has made it even quite popular among deer hunters in some areas, although it is generally regarded as very underpowered for deer unless bullet placement is absolutely precise. Many jurisdictions such as the Netherlands, the UK and some states in the USA currently prohibit the Hornet for use on deer.\n[B][U]\n.22 High Power (5.6 x 52R)[/U][/B]\nThe 5.6x52R cartridge was created by Charles Newton and produced by Savage Arms in 1912. It is also known as the .22 Savage High-Power and .22 "Imp", and is based upon the .25-35 Winchester cartridge necked down to accept a .227in/.228in diameter bullet.\nIts inherent accuracy, relatively high velocity and "shocking" power led to an initial surge of popularity, and the "Imp" was attributed with almost magical killing powers even on large and dangerous soft-skinned game such as tigers. However, following a well-publicized spate of fatalities and severe injuries among big game hunters who had merely wounded their quarry with the "Imp''s" small, speedy bullets, the cartridge rapidly fell out of favor with safari and deer hunters.\n[B][U]\n.25 Remington (UMC-Union Metallic Co)[/U][/B]\nThe .25 Remington (also known as the .25 Remington Auto-Loading) is an American rifle cartridge. A rimless, smokeless powder design, this cartridge was considered to be very accurate by firearm experts and suitable for game up to deer and black bear. The .25 Remington cartridge dates back to 1906 with its introduction by Remington in the Model 8 rifle. Other rifles chambered for the .25 Remington include the Remington 14 slide-action, Remington 30 bolt action, Stevens 425 lever-action, and Standard Arms rifles.\n[B][U]\n.256 W.M- Winchester Magnum [/U][/B]\nThe .256 Winchester Magnum was a firearms cartridge produced by necking-down a .357 Magnum cartridge to .257 diameter. It was introduced in 1960 and designed for shooting small game and varmints. The cartridge was first chambered in the Ruger Hawkeye single shot pistol.\n \n[B][U].25-20 WCF- Winchester Centerfire[/U][/B]\nThe .25-20 Winchester, or WCF (Winchester Centerfire) was developed in 1895 for the Winchester Model 1892 lever action rifle. In the early 20[SUP]th[/SUP] century, it was a popular big game and varmint round, developing around 1460 ft/s with 86 grain bullets.

Both adjustments can be set for longer or shortner distances. I''m amazed as to the performance of the kit. It is extremetly good.

The .280 was meant for single shot and double barreled sporting rifles. It was one of the first successful modern high velocity small bore cartridges, and enjoyed a considerable, if brief vogue as a hunting round in the years before the First World War. It initially gained its reputation because of its evident ''knock-down'' effect on thin skinned game, but this began to sour when it was used on more dangerous game, which, if not killed outright, on occasion turned on the hunter with fatal results.

The safety was  really hard to move and double action was not working at all. The  hammer would go rearward but would not break. I did the complete  dis-assembly of the gun, cleaned the factory lubricant and oiled the gun  lightly. I assisted the rearward motion of the hammer with my thumb a  couple of times and it was breaking crisp. The built quality is very  strong, the bluing was good, and the plastic grip is below average.\n[CENTER] [URL="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yxnAc1hKEkI/Ub7yZNiuf7I/AAAAAAAAATY/5gDEF6K62NM/s1600/baikal+dis+assembly.jpg"][IMG]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yxnAc1hKEkI/Ub7yZNiuf7I/AAAAAAAAATY/5gDEF6K62NM/s640/baikal+dis+assembly.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/CENTER]\n \nI have a habit of dis-assembling my gun to bits.

Of which two pronged leaf spring is most  amazing. The spring has three purposes: it gives support to trigger,  hammer and serves as a catch for magazine. I told my friend about the  amazing spring design and he joked,[INDENT] [B][I]"Had the gun inventor consumed one bottle less than his daily dose  of vodka, he would have found a way to use the leaf spring for managing  recoil as well."[/I][/B][/INDENT]\n[CENTER] [URL="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p88xxFc8iLQ/Ub70hp6iLDI/AAAAAAAAATo/e5xFIasGimo/s1600/makarov+(2).jpg"][IMG]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p88xxFc8iLQ/Ub70hp6iLDI/AAAAAAAAATo/e5xFIasGimo/s640/makarov+(2).jpg[/IMG][/URL][/CENTER]\n  The magazines have thumb loading notches on them to ease the ammunition  loading.

I have however no experience of any handgun i just got my new license and am looking for my first 9mm. i have about 80K to put into a gun and i have narrowed down my choices to the following.\n\nTaurus 24/7 G2 - 70 K\nTaurus 809E - 70K\nCZ 75 P07 - 85K \n\nI really like the Taurus safety features the decocker, saftey and Taurus lock. I think i would use those until i got familiar and comfortable with the gun. Both 24/7 and 809 are based on the 24/7 OSS the only difference being 809 being hammer and G2 being striker fired. The G2 also has a Glock like trigger safety and adjustable sights. \n\nI like the feel of both the Taurus models and especially like the memory pads where fingers can be placed. The CZ also feels nice in the hands but i could not find a NIB in the market the quote above was provided by PARA and he says he will be getting stock next month. i found one used one and the dealer is asking 95K for it.\n\nAny advice would be welcome.\n\nThanks guys and this is my first post on Pak Guns i have been reading the forums for a few months now.', 1, 0, '202.125.144.227', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I already have handguns for that. i want a rifle that is an actual rifle not a cross between a rifle and an SMG.  Whats teh big idea about the fake barrel anyway.. If people dont want 18 inchers.. they can have em chopped off when ever they want..[/QUOTE]\nED short barrelled rifles serve a very different purpose to 18 inched long barrelled rifles. If you want to run it in a competition like IDPA having a shorter barrel makes it much easier to manoeuvre and manipulate the rifle around. Also in my own personal experience even a 7.5 inched AR-15 can shoot out to 300 yards without a magnified optic very accurately. There is not much advantaged gained when you''re moving from 16 to 18inches of barrel. If you move to 20 then yes there is more advantage gained. A 14.5 inched AR is just as accurate as an 18inch AR within the 300 yard range and rarely are you going to take it past that range. The .223 round is built for CQB scenarios within a range of 400 yards, although an 18 inch barrel is more accurate than its shorter counterparts but only slightly and it makes the rifle heavy and hard to manipulate in competition. Which is why Im trying to find shorter Barrels for the PAR MK3 but the authorised distributors refuse to import even an extra 14.5inch barrel for me. If ANYONE knows someone who could get me a 14.5 or less barrel for the PAR MK3 id greatly appreciate it, id even buy them lunch!\n  The affective range of a handgun and that of a rifle round, the controllability of a rifle and a handgun and the lethality of the round of a handgun and a rifle.

Lodhi (General Secretary of National Rifle Association), I thought to call him before I visit to his office, I explained my situation to him but he excused from helping as he mentioned that their association is in no position to instruct or ask a government body for such kind of help.\n\nI haven’t lost hope and thought to share my problem here and ask PG members for help, as maybe someone knows how to sort-out this kind of situation.\n\nSo, I would be very much grateful if someone can help me in getting the detained items released.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nit is ministry of commerce who are authorized to provide you classification NOC take the contact number of SO2 ADM from website i think it is kamran now a day he himself is NOC providing authority.........

Not so in Pakistan not that i am bashing the gunsmiths here but i highly doubt they can find all the original parts and tools needed for the job.\n\nIn Pakistan it more like get a mainstream gun that is well tested and tried so that you have a better chance of getting something that lasts and works reliably. \n\nBut don''t you think that for a first time handgun owner saftey ranks 1st honestly apart from the feel thats the reason i wanted to go for a Taurus with saftey , decocker and their proprietary locking system.\n\nCZ 75B looks like a great gun but lacks some of the safety features. Some posts i have read also suggest getting an all steel gun just for minimal recoil and better accuracy.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nBro..just get what feels right in your hand... trust me, many of us had striker fired pistols as their first hand guns and without any decocker or manual safety... the best safety is you yourself and always stick to the 5 basics of gun handling..

You have to compare it with Saiga-12-030 or Saiga-12-040, Saiga-12&#1057;-EXP-01-030. in my personal opinion we compare only the cheapest and ugliest versions of Saiga-12 (that versions of Saiga-12 is not very popular in Russia)with vepr12.\n\nUpto my information Vepr-12 and Saiga-12-030/040 both were made under the same order form Special Forces of Russian Army and Police so they have interchangeable magazines that fits both, gas block without gas plug, non removable dust cover with Picatinny. Both Molot Vepr-12 and IZMASH Saiga-12-030 ware made for Law enforcement and Military use and later was adopted to civil market use. In many details Saiga-12-030 and Vepr-12 are completely different due to productions was adapted to AKM production line (IZMASH) and RPK production line (Molot).\n\nHence, we can differenciate saiga 030 and 040 as, saiga 030 is automatic gas adjustment mechanism and shorter sight radius, whereas 040 has manual adjustment for light and heavy loads i.e birdshot and buck/slug with a longer sight radius..\n\nFew noticed differences \n\n1) The RPK receiver is heavier and stronger then AKM receiver, so thickness of the receiver on Vepr-12 more than on Saiga-12-030/040....\n\n\n2) The technology of barrel production of Vepr-12 and Saiga-12 is also different, Molot use rotary forging during production and IZMASH use boring and their barrels have less resource and quality...\n(You can notice it when u shoot slug, sg/lg and see after marks in barrel, it tells u hardness of chromed)...\n\n3) The barrel walls of Vepr-12 are thicker than of Saiga-12....\n\n\n4) The inner diameter of the Vepr-12''s bore is 18.5mm, when Saiga-12 is 18.3mm....\n\n\n5) The different folding stock mechanism as well as stocks are little bit different (SVD-style)...\n\n\n6) Vepr-12 is heavier then Saiga-12...\n\n\n7) Both saiga and vepr have LRBHO (last round bolt hold open option), and both model i am discussing have mag well...\n\n\n8) Vepr-12 has different safety selector then Saiga-12-030/040... Vepr''s latch can also be operated by thumb...\n\n\n9) Vepr-12 has different gas tube, and AKM upper and low hand guard doesn''t fit Vepr-12 (only from RPK).\n\n10) saiga have rails on dustcover and a small one at lower hand guard, where as vepr''s dustcover and upper and lower handguard is allover covered with rails (altogether 6rails (includes small, med, large)\n\nrest if i am left with any seniors can add it\n\nNow my person liking, though vepr is some what u can say is lil bit better built, but still i like shooting saiga, because of its manual adjustment option.if once u get perfection in setting gas mechanism this option allows u to set minimum and maximum recoil (depending on mood and usage), saiga has tight barrel so reult in tight group, it fits me better... Well the one last thing i dont like about vepr is if u mix heavy and light loads it tends to jam, then i say wats the use of auto adjustment gas module, when in both cases u can fire same loads, either heavy or light.. \nWell i have fired few models of saiga ie. saiga12s, saiga 12c, 12c -exp-01, 030, exp0030, saiga 12k 0040-02, 040-04,0401 exp-01, both in wodden furniture and synthatic furniture...\nthe exp is for export models.. The difference in normal and export version is, the normal version only fires with its butt opened and if u have to fold the stock u, first have to lock the gun, then fold it by pressing the button. once fold, then lock gets stucked and dont open untill one opens the butt.. If force is applied it destroys the lock and trigger assembly and have to be taken to gunsmith.\nwhearas export version has no conection between folding stock and locking mechanism.. \nThis differenciation is due to russian civilian arms law.\n\nand in vepr i had fired only 2 model my own which was imported in 2012 with removable flasher and other one was with shortened barrel and fixed flasher ..\n\npardon my spelling mistakes and grammatical mistakes, and correct me,coz english is not my mother tongue, and am not good at writing details..\n [ATTACH=CONFIG]21960[/ATTACH]\n\nRecently i am after choke adapter for saiga, which allows chokes to be used on ordinary saiga.. It basically replaced by flasher, the adapter tube furtger have inner threads on other end which support chokes.. Well i myself has seen it only once, the guy was using it at range, with 23inch barrel and it looked like hunting model\n\nRegarding prices i believe both have same prices, but in khi dealers have given alot of hype to vepr''s quality and thus over charging alot...Hope this helps,', 1, 1, '115.167.118.161', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

As a point of example, if you ever hold a 1911 in one hand and a Glock in the other, you''ll immediately realize that the shallower the grip angle, the easier it is to employ a sturdy two-hand grip. The extreme grip angle of the Glock (which is near identical to the grip angle of the P08 Luger) is actually ideal for [B]single-hand[/B] shooting; for using both hands, one needs to cant or rotate the wrists forward in order to line up the lights on to the target. The opposite is true for a 1911 (or any other gun with a relatively shallow grip angle, like the TP-9).\n\nThe grip angle, in turn, influences how we grip the gun; where does the thumb of the support hand rests, where does the base of the support hand''s palm rests on the gun''s grip, and so on. Hence, it is extremely important to first get a "feel" of the gun before you purchase it; if the gun doesn''t "feel" right or doesn''t sit in your hands perfectly, then it will [B]definitely[/B] jump around when discharged.\n\nI personally like guns with a shallow grip angle (metal CZ''s fit my hands the best, followed very closely by the 1911) and, therefore, I am able to manage the recoil easily as well.', 1, 1, '111.68.105.254', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Without any bias, IMHO, this gun has the most crisp trigger as compared to all of the above mentioned\n\nLow Bore Axis: which results in extremely low recoil and excellent for follow up shots. Again amongst all the above mentioned, this gun recoils the least\n\nExtremely Accurate and this is not just a personal observation. Almost all those who have shot with a Caracal F agree upon this.\n\nThis point is probably an extension to the point mentioned above. Caracal Fs come with a 4.1 inch barrel which is longer than most of the regular handguns. However Pt92s come with a 5 inch Barrel.... a longer barrel results in more accuracy and range but any weapon with too long a barrel might become problem to conceal\n\nThe gun is Polymer made and weights only 750 grams as compared to its counter Rival Glock 17 which weights 650 grams.. However all of the above mentioned handguns weigh more than Caracal.\n\nCaracal has extremly slim profile (Even slimmer than Glocks) which again makes them comparatively easier to conceal\n\nThe Full size Caracal F is slightly shorter than the Full size Glock 17 and just slightly longer than the Sub Compact Glock 19 which again supports in its Conceal\n\nCaracal F holds 18 Rounds, None of the above mentioned guns including Glocks hold that much fire power\n\nA Torture test was conducted by Armi on Caracal Fs. They shot 5000 rounds within 92 minutes through this gun without any failures. Further our very own Cheif conducted a torture test on this weapon as well. You can check out the Caracal Club or directly Youtube to find links of both.\n\nThis handgun was designed by Wilhelm Bubits who at one time was part of the Glock team and later joined Steyr to develop models M and S with them and Caracal F is his final design\n\nCaracal F holds 3 extremely tough and stringent certifications which only a few handgun manufactures such as Glock or Sig hold. Again you can check out the details of these on their website\n\n\n\n[B]Cons:\nThis gun is not for you if you don''t handle it like a professional. It comes without any Manual Safety. However it does have the 3 Safeties which are Trigger Safety, Drop safety and firing pin safety. But if you pull the trigger on a cocked gun, it''s gona shoot and ain''t nothing gona stop it..\n\nThere has been an optional recall called on Caracal F''s due to doubt in drop safety functionality. You can read details on their website\n\nThis gun comes with 2 sight Options. Quick sight (QS) and Straight 8 or 2 dot sights. The QS are excellent for short range follow up shots but do not have satisfactory results with slightly increased distances so no fun at the range. Straight 8s or 2 Dot sights are excellent sights but they may require some time getting used to[/B][/B]', 1, 1, '110.93.196.12', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

As a point of example, if you ever hold a 1911 in one hand and a Glock in the other, you''ll immediately realize that the shallower the grip angle, the easier it is to employ a sturdy two-hand grip. The extreme grip angle of the Glock (which is near identical to the grip angle of the P08 Luger) is actually ideal for [B]single-hand[/B] shooting; for using both hands, one needs to cant or rotate the wrists forward in order to line up the lights on to the target. The opposite is true for a 1911 (or any other gun with a relatively shallow grip angle, like the TP-9).\n\nThe grip angle, in turn, influences how we grip the gun; where does the thumb of the support hand rests, where does the base of the support hand''s palm rests on the gun''s grip, and so on. Hence, it is extremely important to first get a "feel" of the gun before you purchase it; if the gun doesn''t "feel" right or doesn''t sit in your hands perfectly, then it will [B]definitely[/B] jump around when discharged.\n\nI personally like guns with a shallow grip angle (metal CZ''s fit my hands the best, followed very closely by the 1911) and, therefore, I am able to manage the recoil easily as well.[/QUOTE]\n\nCheers Ahnab, makes perfect sense! glad i spent a lot of time "feeling up" various hardware (damn, that don''t sound right at all!)...\n\nanyhow, the TP9 felt just about right, which is why i am enjoying it and absolutely comfortable carrying and handling it too :)\n\nthe second thing that felt right was the Taurus 709 Slim G2 and the Steyr M9-A1 (a friend''s) maybe when someday i''m richer, I''ll get me a Steyr :D\n\ntill then lemme save up for a 709 for CC ;)\n\nHopefully as I learn and develop, I''ll grow to handle other guns as well too', 1, 1, '119.30.126.162', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Right[/QUOTE]\n  ATA- bro, there it says sporting rifle with bore .22inch "OR" (not and) 7mm bore non automatic rifle;\nThis clearly tells us that they are talking about sporting rifles which have a bore of .22inch rather than just .22LR and as Leon pointed down below that includes a host of different calibers which include .223 semi auto. As far as the action is concerned it specifically states "non automatic" only for the 7mm bore, not .22bore sporting rifles, it is a known fact that .22bore sporting rifles are semi automatic rifles all over the world. Even the pre 2012 laws said the exact same thing how ever there was an exception that I will point out. \nConclusion that can be drawn is, all rifles that have a bore of .22inch and are sporting rifles that are non full auto are NPB which includes .223 semi auto AR-15s. In the past i.e. pre 2012 these guns were not NPB because along with the notification mentioned here there were additions that said "Excluding .223 semi auto calibers specifically". Such a clause is not present in this current notification so .223 semi auto rifles are still NPB according to this notification.\n  As far as the limit on licenses is concerned the limit as per law only applies to those who will get licenses according to this new notification, those are just basics of law. Something that was legal in the past but rules have changed, apply from that point on not that point back.

It really doesnt make a significant difference as far as energy delivered, but a longer barrel does help control the spread of shot, or pellets, allowing you to reach out further with a higher concentration of lead. Yet in all honesty, if you want a better pattern, a good set of chokes will do a lot more for you than a couple more inches of barrel.

Where as in case, when i fired first round from DUTY, i was straight away in love with this handgun. \n\nI am not a professional shooter, just an average hobby-keeper sort of person but believe me i achieved unbelievable targets with this pistol, e.g. 5/5 from 10 meters in 1 Sq.in Target or 5/5 from 15 meters in 2 Sq.in Target.\n\nThe feel, grip and overall handling is also near perfect. Sights are solid and easy to shoot(glock type). Dissembling is easy, though i don''t like its spring much. \n\nIt comes either with de-cocker or safety lock. Good for conceal carry. One more beautiful feature is its trigger.. 100/100 points. it is called Omega Trigger System from CZ. Pull is feather light on SA and quite manageable on DA. \n\nOverall, it is a reliable weapon to keep as CCW, SD or HD.', 1, 0, '39.32.237.65', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You have to compare it with Saiga-12-030 or Saiga-12-040, Saiga-12&#1057;-EXP-01-030. in my personal opinion we compare only the cheapest and ugliest versions of Saiga-12 (that versions of Saiga-12 is not very popular in Russia)with vepr12.\r\n\r\nUpto my information Vepr-12 and Saiga-12-030/040 both were made under the same order form Special Forces of Russian Army and Police so they have interchangeable magazines that fits both, gas block without gas plug, non removable dust cover with Picatinny. Both Molot Vepr-12 and IZMASH Saiga-12-030 ware made for Law enforcement and Military use and later was adopted to civil market use. In many details Saiga-12-030 and Vepr-12 are completely different due to productions was adapted to AKM production line (IZMASH) and RPK production line (Molot).\r\n\r\nHence, we can differenciate saiga 030 and 040 as, saiga 030 is automatic gas adjustment mechanism and shorter sight radius, whereas 040 has manual adjustment for light and heavy loads i.e birdshot and buck/slug with a longer sight radius..\r\n\r\nFew noticed differences \r\n\r\n1) The RPK receiver is heavier and stronger then AKM receiver, so thickness of the receiver on Vepr-12 more than on Saiga-12-030/040....\r\n\r\n\r\n2) The technology of barrel production of Vepr-12 and Saiga-12 is also different, Molot use rotary forging during production and IZMASH use boring and their barrels have less resource and quality...\r\n(You can notice it when u shoot slug, sg/lg and see after marks in barrel, it tells u hardness of chromed)...\r\n\r\n3) The barrel walls of Vepr-12 are thicker than of Saiga-12....\r\n\r\n\r\n4) The inner diameter of the Vepr-12''s bore is 18.5mm, when Saiga-12 is 18.3mm....\r\n\r\n\r\n5) The different folding stock mechanism as well as stocks are little bit different (SVD-style)...\r\n\r\n\r\n6) Vepr-12 is heavier then Saiga-12...\r\n\r\n\r\n7) Both saiga and vepr have LRBHO (last round bolt hold open option), and both model i am discussing have mag well...\r\n\r\n\r\n8) Vepr-12 has different safety selector then Saiga-12-030/040... Vepr''s latch can also be operated by thumb...\r\n\r\n\r\n9) Vepr-12 has different gas tube, and AKM upper and low hand guard doesn''t fit Vepr-12 (only from RPK).\r\n\r\n10) saiga have rails on dustcover and a small one at lower hand guard, where as vepr''s dustcover and upper and lower handguard is allover covered with rails (altogether 6rails (includes small, med, large)\r\n\r\nrest if i am left with any seniors can add it\r\n\r\nNow my person liking, though vepr is some what u can say is lil bit better built, but still i like shooting saiga, because of its manual adjustment option.if once u get perfection in setting gas mechanism this option allows u to set minimum and maximum recoil (depending on mood and usage), saiga has tight barrel so reult in tight group, it fits me better... Well the one last thing i dont like about vepr is if u mix heavy and light loads it tends to jam, then i say wats the use of auto adjustment gas module, when in both cases u can fire same loads, either heavy or light.. \r\nWell i have fired few models of saiga ie. saiga12s, saiga 12c, 12c -exp-01, 030, exp0030, saiga 12k 0040-02, 040-04,0401 exp-01, both in wodden furniture and synthatic furniture...\r\nthe exp is for export models.. The difference in normal and export version is, the normal version only fires with its butt opened and if u have to fold the stock u, first have to lock the gun, then fold it by pressing the button. once fold, then lock gets stucked and dont open untill one opens the butt.. If force is applied it destroys the lock and trigger assembly and have to be taken to gunsmith.\r\nwhearas export version has no conection between folding stock and locking mechanism.. \r\nThis differenciation is due to russian civilian arms law.\r\n\r\nand in vepr i had fired only 2 model my own which was imported in 2012 with removable flasher and other one was with shortened barrel and fixed flasher ..\r\n\r\npardon my spelling mistakes and grammatical mistakes, and correct me,coz english is not my mother tongue, and am not good at writing details..\r\n\r\nRecently i am after choke adapter for saiga, which allows chokes to be used on ordinary saiga.. It basically replaced by flasher, the adapter tube furtger have inner threads on other end which support chokes.. Well i myself has seen it only once, the guy was using it at range, with 23inch barrel and it looked like hunting model\r\n\r\nRegarding prices i believe both have same prices, but in khi dealers have given alot of hype to vepr''s quality and thus over charging alot...Hope this helps,[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nZia Raza, I would rather say that you have a strong communication with good hold over language.

The theme (by creating a short video) was to feature an invention which had the greatest impact on human civilization. And since the mousetrap is really the most frequent invention filed in the patent offices worldwide - It seems liked the obvious choice. So when combined with my own AutoCAD skills, it made for a great video!!!\n\nSee this link to know a bit more about the competition:\n[URL]https://vimeo.com/34468561[/URL]\n\nBut guess what, all the judges were so [B]*Bad''zauk*[/B] by nature, that they awarded prizes to videos which had a [B]*roti-dhoti*[/B] sob-story kind of a theme (like the invention of prosthetic limbs)... And so my efforts were not even considered worthy of being in the top 100... Somehow, I feel that it was due to discrimination (since I am a Pakistani). They of course favored an Indian, partly because he also had a [B]*roti-dhoti*[/B] theme, but mainly because (I feel) he was not from a Muslim country...\n\nOf course, had I showed something like extreme poverty, or some other type of extreme injustice (like throwing acid on the faces of women). And also featured some cry-baby lawyer too, who''d be fighting a constant uphill battle with no end in sight - Then I too could have easily won an Oscar Award... Another shortcut to success is to write a controversial article or a book (preferably bordering on blasphemy), and then hire some goons to do some firing at your own house - After which you then go seek asylum somewhere in Scandinavia or EU. And so in the process also get interviewed by CNN and BBC too!\n\nBut somehow, I decided not to tarnish the image of my own nation - As I really do owe a lot to Pakistan. So instead I just have fun with my YouTube account (as video making is just a hobby of mine). However yes, I too have been offered to participate in making something horrible, the offer actually came from Israel (when I traced the IP number). It came at a time when my account had crossed 200,000 views - So I guess that''s when it caught the attention of their "talent scouts".

After which form along with challan is submitted at NADRA.\n3. NADRA issue you a Demand Note (Ahhhh: don''t ask for time line, heard it takes 21 to 45 days).\n4. After Receipt of DN, you buy weapon from dealer and get it register with DCO.\n5. After that Demand Note is deposited back at NADRA.\n6. After 14 days, you will get Card License along with Supplimentary Document (One Page Document).\n\n\nThe dealer provides you the Demand Note on which you buy weapon. The rest is handled by dealer. For confirmation that your license is genuine, ask dealer to provide you copy of Approval Letter, Challan Form and Receipt.

If you ask 10 people their opinion on what the best gun is , you can get 10 different answers. If you asked 20 people to recommend a gun, you''d probably get 50 different answers. However, those guns mentioned would probably include all the new models of the last two decades. The point is, it''s pretty hard to get a "bad" gun these days, and the reason why you get so many different answers is because not everyone has the exact same hand size, shape, strength, experience, or even eyesight. You obviously have a good number of recommendations, so if you are at the stage where you''re itching to spend some money, the best thing to do is to go hold, feel, fire if possible, otherwise dry fire, and look down the sights of the top choices in your mind. The most important thing with a gun is for [B]you[/B] to be comfortable.

Do you have any welding experience? If yes, then are you good at gas welding, or electric? Also, have you ever smelted lead from a used car battery? And cement masonry work - Do you have any personal experience in it?\n\nIf you say that you''ll hire people to get it done for you - Then like all other respected members of this forum, I too will tell you to just go to a shooting range instead of bothering with this kind of stuff. Seriously, this is not child''s play we are talking of here...\n\nAlso, when doing this indoors (as I too do not wish to annoy my neighbors) - You''ll need breathing, eye, and specially ear protection. Otherwise you''ll really live to regret it some time in the future. See this picture I just took. I have a very good goggle for eye safety, a gas mask to make sure that I don''t breath in any gunsmoke, thick leather gloves too (for added safety) - And most importantly, I use double ear protection. So first I put on ear plugs, on top of those I then wear heavy duty earmuffs! Otherwise I''d simply go deaf...\n\nSo only if you have some technical experience when it comes to constructing things (like knowing how to cut/shape steel with grinders and other machine tools, how to smelt metals like lead, and how to fix it all securely in cement), and are also well equipped with safety hardware - Is when I''ll explain how to build such a thing... And soundproofing a room where you''ll be doing this is a subject that I haven''t even touched yet!\n\nTherefore, like everyone else is suggesting here, please go to a shooting range instead. As in my opinion too, a shooting range is a safer and cheaper option for you. I just did this crazy thing because A, when I started this hobby, there weren''t many shooting ranges one could get easy access to (and I too was underaged). And B, I am (even today) most uncomfortable carrying a gun from one place to another (specially when section 144 is in effect). So that''s the only reason why I did it. And C, my experience with guns goes back to almost 3 decades (as I started when I was just 6 years old). So that''s why I was confidant that I''d do it correctly. And I so did - But anyone else PLEASE don''t try it unless you know exactly what you are doing. As even the slightest mistake can lead to a very serious accident...\n\nBy the way, you can buy all this safety equipment from any shop on Serai road (near the Khori Gardens area).\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22076[/ATTACH]', 1, 1, '119.155.24.13', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

I don''t know how the pricing will translate in Pakistan, but all things being equal, I find Vortex to offer better value for an equivalent model. Also, I feel they offer more options for reticle types, illumination or not, adjustable eye relief, turret style... But what got me into them was that I was looking for a short to medium range optic solution. I ended up using a red dot with a 3x magnifier behind it. That way, with a quick disconnect mount I could twist the magnifier off for short range. Then my friend said Vortex has a 6x scope and when you turn it to 0 mag, you can use it like a red dot with unlimited eye relief and illuminated reticle. I forget the model now, but i checked it out and really wanted that setup. It was too late for that, but I was still looking for something long range and ended up getting a Viper Hs 6-24X50. Needless to say I was extremely impressed with its adjustability, build quality, and image clarity and brightness, so I''ve been singing their praises ever since. I also really like how Vortex organizes their model line up, Razor series is high end, Viper is medium high, Diamondback medium low, and Crossfires are lowmend models. I think Leupold has more variety, but their models always confuse me with their hunting line up, tactical, rimfire, VX... oh, and like Leupold, Vortex offers a transferable lifetime warranty. Also, Jerry Miculek, S&W''s world record holding shooter recommends them which is a nice vote of confidence. Anyways, I''ve used Bushnells, Nikon, and Leupold, but from now on as long as they have something that fits my needs, my first choice will be Vortex.[/FONT][/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]', 1, 0, '24.85.141.11', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

You will of course need a plastic heat sealer that people use to plastic cover their books, (which you can from across the road, on the other side of M. A. Jinnah road, when going to Serai road or the road after that) - Do keep in mind that this wet foam brick can only be used for just a few times, but it is damn effective... \n\nBehind it of course, you''ll need a thick plate of lead (2 inches will be more than enough), and behind that a few sandbags (to absorb the impact). And behind that, a cement wall. The only thing which is tricky in all of this, is getting the lead out from used car batteries (especially the new gel packed maintenance free type)...

Unless you are using tracer bullets - But those too will pass through the styrofoam so quickly, that I seriously doubt anything will catch fire. And even if it does, it will be just a 4 inch disk of styrofoam which will burn. So who really cares? I only suggested styrofoam because it will not create any high speed shrapnel when getting hit by a bullet, (as you are new to this) - Otherwise (in a situation like this) I myself would actually prefer small mirrors that would be reflecting the bright blue sky.

When I slapped in the 2nd mag the issue appeared, without pressing the slide release lever the Duty just loaded the ammo from the 2nd mag itself. At first I thought may be I pressed the slide release lever by mistake (although it''s bloody hard) but this happened after every new loaded mag that I put in.

Just write it down on white paper and get it signed from the owner and keep it along with CNIC copies of owner and yourself. Nothing else is needed.\n\nBTW, Notary Public is a lawyer designated by Bar Council for the job. His attestation holds legal value. In Pakistan, I have seen that usually weak lawyer (who does not have good clientele) is given the post to financially accommodate him. Notary Public have offices in every Court (Kachehry / Adalaat). All he charges is Rs. 50 / 100 per document and even less and there is no hassle involved (but your uncle will have to go with you or if you have any lawyer friend, he can get it done for you). So, you can get it done easily but that is not required.\n\nAn addition: You can even mention the geographical boundaries with in which the authorized person can drive the car (e.g. Within Lahore, Within District of Lahore, Within Province of Punjab or Within Pakistan).\n\n@ raff: Bro! You are right. But there is no law on this (authority letter thing). If the vehicle is not registered in the name of person who is driving, as per law, all they can do is "Fine" the driver.

I was off work today and had some free time on my hands, so I spent some time researching various websites, including: the BATF, US Customs and the TSA looking for an answer to your question. At one point I saw info regarding firearm importation on the ATF site that said to contact the US Customs, and then on the US Customs site they said to contact the ATF...talk about circles and red tape!\n\n\nTo make a long story even longer, here''s where my research led me: on the FAQ section of the ATF site, under the heading of O. Semiautomatic Assault Weapons and Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Devices (SAWs and LCAFDs) there''s a section on "Importation" that says that large capacity magazines are still subject to the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act and that a Form 6 import permit is still required. Then if you take a look at the "Instruction Sheet" for Form 6 on the ATF site, specifically section 9b that states: "9. Under Arms Export Control Act regulations in 27 CFR 47.41(c), a permit is not required for the importation of: b. Minor components and parts of Category I(a) firearms, except barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or complete breech mechanisms, when the total value does not exceed $100 wholesale in any single transaction. The $100 wholesale value supersedes the previous dollar threshold of $500 wholesale in any single transaction." If you then search the ATF site for 27 CFR 47.41(c), you''ll come across "Subpart C - Firearms" which relates to the "Control of the International Movement of Firearms, Their Parts and Components, and Ammunition". If you look at the bottom of page 6 & top of page 7, you''ll see section 47.41 (c) under the "Permit Requirement" heading, which also states that if the total value of the parts doesn''t exceed $100, then a permit is not required.\n\n\nI know you said you had a phone number for the BATF, but I found this info on the site directly related to importing, "If you have any questions or concerns about temporarily importing\nfirearms or ammunition into the United States, please call ATF’s Firearms and Explosives Imports Branch at 202-927-8320."\n\n\nFWIW, the TSA has one page about "Traveling With Special Items", relating to how to store your firearms and ammunition for traveling.\n\n\nAt any rate, I hope this helps you out, but I''d suggest calling the ATF Imports Branch just to confirm. If you do find out exactly what the law is, I don''t know about anyone else, but I''d definitely be interested in knowing what they had to say.\nI posted this question on several forums, this is by far the best response I''ve gotten. \n\n\nAlso, I''ve asked on a couple of gun-shops, and everybody looked at me like I was crazy..\n\n\n"Of COURSE you can have them mailed.

With extensive combat experience around the globe, instructors Travis Haley and Chris Costa cover not only the "how to" aspects of the Carbine but also the "mindset" required to employ a carbine effectively under stress.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Magpul Dynamics- The Art of The Tactical Carbine, Volume 2\n\n\nInstructors Travis Haley and Chris Costa take Carbine operation to the next level. An informative and exhilarating Dynamic Carbine class that focuses on pushing your failure points and finding the perfect balance between speed and accuracy. Using real advanced shooters from the firearms industry, law enforcement SWAT, and military special operations, this DVD set will show that no matter what level of the game you''re in, you always have the ability to excel.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Magpul Dynamics - The Art of the Dynamic Handgun\n\n\nUsing a diverse group of beginner, intermediate, and advanced students, instructors Travis Haley and Chris Costa guide the class from the fundamentals of handgun operation, to problem solving, and through complex real-life scenarios. This progression from basic to advanced weapon manipulation pushes students of all skill levels to their failure points, illustrating how even the best shooters can advance and excel.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Shotgun Gunfighting- Gabe Suarez \n\n\nThe shotgun, if used correctly inside its performance envelope is, potentially, the best CQB weapon in existence today. This dynamic DVD presents a reality based, aggressive, close quarters combative method of deploying the shotgun. We discuss the various generations of shotgun development, as well as common-sense accessories that the viewer will find useful.\n\n\nFilmed outside, in the Northern Arizona back country, we had the freedom to do as we pleased with regards to setting up shots and angles to capture every nuance of handling the weapon. There is some wind evident in some parts of the production, but it does not detract from the presentation of the information. All four generations of shotgun development are discussed and shown to include the double barrel, the pump action, the semi auto and the magazine-fed semi auto, as well as what each generation brings to the table. Most demonstrations are conducted with the Remington 870, the Remington 1100, or the Saiga 12.\n\n\nMost shotgun schools spend a great deal of time discussing modifications and additions to the shotgun, or try to convince the viewer to turn this CQB weapon into some sort of a rifle suitable only for range games, or gun school scores. That is happily not the case in SHOTGUN GUNFIGHTING! In this DVD you will learn what the shotgun is REALLY for, and perhaps as important, learn the weapon''s limitations. After a brief overview of the fundamentals, we progress quickly to advanced reality-based drills such as Hostage Rescue Shooting, Ambidextrous Work, and Ammo Transitions. This is the Shotgun version of Close Range Gunfighting.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Practical Shooting- Matt Burkett\n\n\nWatch and learn as professional shooter Matt Burkett teaches his student (Kevin Elpers) the techniques required to be a successful handgun shooter. Everything is covered: Safety, Equipment Choice and Set-up, Stance, Grip, Eye Dominance, Sight Information, Weak/Strong Hand, Target Transitions, Draws, Reloads, Trigger Control, Shooting while Moving and lots more! Guest Star Don Golembieski (master gunsmith) takes you through equipment selection and maintenance. Volume 3 includes a bonus interview with your host who discusses cross-dominance, sighting techniques, the fundamentals of shooting, and, the "breakdown of firing a single shot" maybe more than you bargained for. :) This video set will teach the skills and techniques needed to dominate in the competitive shooting sports as well as provide an advanced level of knowledge and skill set for the casual shooter.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Kalashnikov Rifle Gunfighting - Basic and Advanced- Gabe Suarez\n\n\nThe AK-47/74 series of rifle is one of the most prolific and useful weapons on earth. More than 100 million have been made in various parts of the world, and the odds of encountering one on the battlefield or in a civil disturbance are high.\n\n\nBest-selling author and maverick combat shooting instructor Gabriel Suarez has embraced the Kalashnikov rifle system for its utility, accuracy and ruggedness. In this original Paladin Press production, Suarez teaches you the "caveman simple" skills you need to operate the AK rifle platform and win in a combat environment.\n\n\nSuarez addresses the common myths about the AK and explains why it is one of the best weapon choices for urban and close quarters combat. He teaches you about the AK fire control system, proper use of the sling, zeroing the AK and ready/carry positions. Then you will learn about ambidextrous use of the rifle, snap shooting, CQB shooting and the use of the rifle in movement. For information purposes only.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Advanced Close range Gunfighting- Gabe Suarez\n\n\nIn Close Range Gunfighting, Gabe Suarez, the most controversial trainer on the planet, showed you that traditional range training can get you killed. He showed the basics of how to break out of the range mentality. In doing so he challenged the status quo like no one before and changed the way gunfighting is taught in America.\n\n\nIn Advanced Close Range Gunfighting, he shows you the rest of the material. Very fast-paced and full of full-speed concealed carry shooting action, this video will have you doing things most people think are impossible. Gabe shows the benefits of Appendix Carry, Ambidextrous Gunfighting, Weapon Transfers and why it is important you know how to do them, Enhanced Get Off The X Footwork, and an important discussion on the Elements of the Combative Technique of the Pistol. This video will move the art of gunfighting another giant leap forward. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) AGI- Firearm Defense- Shooting In Realistic Settings\n\n\nA Second Amendment Foundation DVD. May I first state that this 1:10 long movie deals with pistols, however, some tactics are covered where rifles can be substituted. Topics in the movie include aiming, speed firing, clearing rooms/buildings, and more. The instructor in the video is a professional, training everyone ranging from normal civillians, to the police and military. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) The Tactical Advantage- Gabe Suarez\n\n\nGiven enough time and practice, anyone can shoot a two-inch group under perfect conditions on the firing range. The problem is that the vast majority of criminals or terrorists aren''t on the range, so to be a well-rounded, reality-based combat shooter, you need to know how to move and shoot under various conditions where you''ll be at a disadvantage.\n\n\nBased on veteran combat shooting instructor Gabe Suarez best-selling book The Tactical Advantage, this video production from Paladin Press teaches you the vital basics of handgun tactics under difficult circumstances.Suarez kicks off his instruction with a comprehensive look at "slicing the pie," navigating both primary and off-side corners to minimize your exposure to danger while giving you the drop on your assailant.\n\n\nFrom there, he shows you how to best clear T-intersections and doorways, traverse stairwells going up and down, clear rooms and deal with a variety of shoot/no-shoot situations.Good marksmanship is only part of the true-fighting arsenal: you need to know tactics.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Combative Pistol Marksmanship- Gabe Suarez\n\n\nIn Combative Pistol Marksmanship, Gabe Suarez establishes the foundation necessary for future intermediate and adsvanced levels. The entire premise is that "SHOOTING IS EASY".\n\n\nGabe proves that, by giving you all the steps needed to fire an accurate shot. All the secrets are here from the fundamentals of marsksmanship to really understanding the surprise break, and the use of the sights, and more. This DVD is suitable for both the advanced shooter as a refresher of things forgotten, and for the novice to learn the correct way the first time. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Judicious Use Of Deadly Force- Massad Ayoob\n\n\nAnyone who has been around firearms for any lenhth of time knows who Massad Ayoob is. His long list of credits include being a sworn police officer as well as a police firearms and deadly force instructor, Director of the Lethal Force Institute (LFI), trustee of the Second Amendment Foundation, and associate editor of Guns Magazine, American Handgunner, Combat Handguns,and other magazines. He is a strong advocate of gun rights for private citizens. The author of nearly 3000 published articles on weapons, self-defense, and law enforcement, he is best known for his 1980 book In The Gravest Extreme: The Role of the Firearm in Personal Defense.\n\n\nIn this 1990 video shot during a course at LFI, Ayoob explains in detail the situations in which lethal force is justified in self defense, and how the Court will analyze such usage. This is recommended viewing for anyone who uses or carries a firearm for self-defense. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n(NEW IN 3.0) Police Survival Shooting- Massad Ayoob\n\n\nOne of the most accomplished police trainers in the U.S., Ayoob takes the officer through all phases of shooting, reloading, cover concealment and criminal apprehension with pistol and shotgun.

Thanks in advance for any responses![/QUOTE]\n\nyou can adjust for over travel but I wouldn''t recommend it because if not done correctly IT WILL DAMAGE THE PISTOL ,the standard trigger is excellent once broken in.\n\nbut if you must know here is how:-\n\nThe over travel screw should not be set too fine.\n\nThe TEST WITH NO BULLETS IN THE GUN.\n\nPull the trigger all the way to the rear as if firing and hold tight at the back of the trigger guard.\n\nRock the hammer back and forth and see and feel if the sear is hitting the hammer hooks...\n\nIf there is any contact at all, the Over travel screw needs backing out more, ie away from the frame, then test again.\n\nThere is no specific distance for the over travel screw.\n\nThis the same test for 1911, if the sear and hammer contact, then sear / hammer hook DAMAGE WILL OCCUR.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!\n\nOver travel screw on ALL firearms not just CZ''s do move\n\nThe over travel stop is a small screw in the trigger...you will need a small allen key\n\nThe purpose is to limit the rearward travel AFTER the shot breaks.  This reduces the "reset distance" required to prep the trigger for the next shot (how far the trigger has to move forward to reset the trigger).  It changes the feel of the trigger stroke....helps for faster and more precise trigger movement\n\nTo set it:-\n\nremove the screw and clean it and the hole well.\n\nPut a drop of blue loctite in the hole and re-install. This will stop the screw from moving when the Loctite dries.\n\nScrew it in and check that both the DA and SA work as they should (nothing hangs when you de-cock manually and the DA falls when you pull slowly). \n\nKeep screwing it in until things stop working, then back it out a 1/4 turn at a time until things just start working again and then give it another 1/8 - 1/4 of a turn for a margin of functionality.  \n\nThen leave it sit for 24 hours for the loctite to dry.', 1, 0, '92.232.170.131', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!\r\n\r\nOver travel screw on ALL firearms not just CZ''s do move\r\n\r\nThe over travel stop is a small screw in the trigger...you will need a small allen key\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to limit the rearward travel AFTER the shot breaks.  This reduces the "reset distance" required to prep the trigger for the next shot (how far the trigger has to move forward to reset the trigger).  It changes the feel of the trigger stroke....helps for faster and more precise trigger movement\r\n\r\nTo set it:-\r\n\r\nremove the screw and clean it and the hole well.\r\n\r\nPut a drop of blue loctite in the hole and re-install. This will stop the screw from moving when the Loctite dries.\r\n\r\nScrew it in and check that both the DA and SA work as they should (nothing hangs when you de-cock manually and the DA falls when you pull slowly). \r\n\r\nKeep screwing it in until things stop working, then back it out a 1/4 turn at a time until things just start working again and then give it another 1/8 - 1/4 of a turn for a margin of functionality.  \r\n\r\nThen leave it sit for 24 hours for the loctite to dry.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nJagga sir, thank you for the detailed and comprehensive write up.

[B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] The box for my Zastava has very light purple (close to blue) colour that is not solid (i.e. it has background white of the box seen in it). Other 2 dealer Zastava boxes were darker purple and solid colour on the box (where Zastava Logo and Serial Number area is)\n2. Stamping on the box - Model: MOD57, CAL: 7.62mm, Serial Number: 22XXXX ([B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] Serial Number for the other 2 started with C2XXXXX!!)\n3. Paperwork (with serial number & an envelope containing feedback questionnaire) inside are identical to other 2, there is no difference whatsoever.\n4. Serial numbers stampings on the pistol''s right side are in the same place on the frame\n5. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] There is no serial number on the barrel on mine, only 7.62mm is stamped, whereas other 2 have Serial Numbers stamped on the barrel\n6. [B]DIFFERENCE: [/B]The round stamp - the barrel trademarking by Zastava - (visible on the barrel) is not as refined as the one on the other 2 that are very clear and even under the magnifying glass\n8. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] The round groove on the barrel on the trigger side is visible on mine - right at the top edge of the ejection port) whereas it is not visible at all on the other 2.\n9. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] On the right side, on the upper frame of the pistol, it is stamped M57 TT not below the ejection port but on the right side, whereas on the other 2 it is stamped 7.62x25 M57 below the ejection port (just as Abbas Bhai''s M57''s picture in his first post of his review of M57).\n10. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] On the right side, on the lower frame, it is stamped ''Read Owners Manual Before Use'' - what owner manual??? This was not stamped on the other 2 M57''s anywhere.\n11. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] Finish, specifically the uneven lines on the top frame to the front sight and the grip finish, show a very poor workmanship on mine when comparing to the the other 2 M57''s.\n12. [B]DIFFERENCE:[/B] Finishing and fitment of the trigger mechanism is nowhere near the same ... (as you know the complete mechanism just pulls out)\n13. [B]ISSUES:[/B] One one particular empty mag, it is very heavy to cock and does not engage the open barrel as it should on an empty mag. After cocking it just twice, the trigger does not engage, NO DRY FIRE, and the mag is jammed until the slider holding the pin to remove the top frame is pushed and the pin is pushed out - thats when the pressing the remove mag button works.\n- On the 2nd mag, everything flawlessly!! \n14. I am suspicious of the Zastava Arms markings on the left side of the frame (top and bottom) as there are not as refined as on other 2 M57''s.\n\nThis is from one of the 3 regular arms dealers I purchase from. One dealer refused to call it a copy (for ethical reasons quoted) but allowed me more than sufficient time to compare the 2 he had in stock with the one I purchased to make my own judgement.\n\nFor those who purchased and/or owned M57''s, your comments are much appreciated. A jamming mag is sufficient reason for me to return it as I want a pistol that is fully functional from the word go and the dealer has already said that he would replace the weapon. I just don''t want to get it replaced with a copy! \n\nPrice I paid for mine is 40K versus 48K the other 2 dealers were demanding.\n\n\nPlease advise on identifying a genuine Zastava M57?\n\n\nReason I like Zastava is that the grip fits well versus the Norinco''s 30cal. Intention is for HD...........  Shall I dump the M57 idea and for HD get the Norinco .30CAL (24K market price and easy to get extra mags) plus a Norinco 1911 .45ACP instead with some money on top. Already have a semi-auto shotgun with 1x 10 rounds mag, and 3 x5 rounds mags. For CC, I have Stoeger (my fav), PT92, PT709 Slim and Walther P22Q. All I desire now is a long range high cal rifle .... but custom built one (& that should leave me content for a good while)\n\nSuggestions please? Thanks in advance.\n\nPS: (off topic a bit): does anyone know where I can source a 416 SS Bar to make a custom rifle barrel?\n\n\nIf you need to see pics of this M57, please let me know.

I bought 1000 rounds and paid 18000 PKR.

Good feel and handling. \n\nI can give a better review regarding Walther P22 as I personally own one and it has performed very well. The gun has hardly any recoil (good for your father''s use also he can do extensive practice with it since ammo is cheaper) - its a 10 shot pistol thus making it very compact and very light thus highly recommended for CC. It has a sort-of dual safety mechanism (manual safety + the gun doesn''t fire if the mag is removed even if there is a round in the chamber though I would not suggest trying that in unsafe environments). Also have only used good quality ammo like RWS High Velocity so I have yet to see any jams or misfires as some PG members claim. Overall great gun.\n\nHowever I am selling my Walther P22 as I am planning to shift to a higher calibre.

He showed me the right way to hold the handgun, and boy o boy did that make a difference. Today I started at 5 meters again, hitting nice groups at the 8 & 9 circles for the first 30-40 rounds. For my next 60 rounds I went back to the dreaded 10 meters, and what do you know, I was hitting the target, had at least 5-8 nice bulls-eyes and most of the groups were appearing at the 8 & 9 circles. \n\nHopefully, on my 3rd-4th visit i will move back to 15 meters as well.

Perfect now.\nTrigger breaks smoothly and has nice takeup. \n\n\nThe slide is smooth. The good part is that there are groves in the front part of the slide which is better for practical shooting.\n\n\nInternals are same as before. The slide doesnt run in the polymer frame. Instead, a metal frame runs within the polymer frame.\nSo its as tough as its predecessor.\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/67FF264D-D7FA-409A-B083-AA033F9744BE-4218-000005E73723D088_zpsfc5ebe24.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThe dislikes:\n\n\nThe grip has some edges that might hurt after exscessive use.\n\n\nMag release is not very prominent hence no fast reloads.\n\n\nThe guns safety/decocker is stiff as before..\n\n[IMG]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj632/Mubashir123/B67C38FC-F5BF-4FE0-BC61-879595DA11B4-4218-000005E77986A8E9_zps81d7536a.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nComparison with np34:\n\nI still love my np34 more.

I think 3-9x or 4-12x is sufficient. Better if it is an AO scope (adjustable objective).\n\nMount this scope low, use lowest possible mounts which work, scope should be just above the rifle, not touching it, but not very high. Light scope on low mounts will minimally disturb the natural balance of the gun.\n\nHold is a mystery yet. I have read an article by Tom Gaylord, a.k.a. [I]B.B. Pelletier about Walther Falcon Hunter .25 cal.\n\nThis old man is the legend who discovered this "Artillery Hold" for spring air rifles...\n\nBut with Walther Falcon Hunter (mostly the same gun as 125 sniper) he advised against the artillery hold, and used a Light Recoiling Center fire rifle like hold, against all the norms.\n\nSo you can experiment with the hold.\n\nURL of his article is here for reading.\n\n[URL]http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/2008/06/walther-25-caliber-falcon-hunter-part-4.html[/URL]\n\nHappy shooting.\n[/I][/QUOTE]\n  Thanks for your appreciation.

In this case, the nine millimetre caliber weapons or their bullets as the 9mm pistol is most popular all over the world due to the ready availability of 9mm bullets. But then the bullets are produced in quantity and are easily available because there is a demand for them.\n\nStill, the handsome and stylish pistols are also sought due to their handiness. When compared to the Kalashnikov AK-47, the 9mm pistol also has a more affordable licence as 9mm after all comes under non-prohibited bore (NPB) and its licence for civilians costs Rs4,000 with Rs500 for annual renewal. Just like this, the licence for a shotgun is Rs2,000 with Rs400 for annual renewal. But the licence for the AK-47 is Rs15,000.\n\nIt falls under the prohibited bore category also makes it difficult to acquire. Automatic weapons that shoot in bursts have especially expensive licences as they are not meant for civilians. A civilian wanting to keep the weapon anyway may have to try other means such as bribing the people concerned to get a licence issued for an AK-47, which means the cost of the licence can go up to Rs100,000 to Rs125,000. The hassle is not welcomed. The AK-47, anyway, is usually owned by companies and businesses to arm their guards.\n\nAnother reason for the AK-47 to be no match in popularity against the 9mm pistol is its size. &#8220;It&#8217;s an assault weapon, which is not handy enough due to its size. As for the pistol, it is far easier to carry around,&#8221; Mohammad Asim Afridi, a weapons dealer near the Lucky Star intersection in Karachi, points out.\n\nKarachi and Lahore are the biggest markets for quality weapons as these are big cities importing the guns. There are a variety of branded 9mm pistols available, for instance, Smith and Wesson, Glock, Heckler & Koch (HK), Walther, Taurus, Sarsilmaz, Ceska Zbrojovka (CZ) and Norinco. Of the brands mentioned the best seller is the Norinco, which is made in China, the Turkish Sarsilmaz and the Brazilian Taurus pistol. &#8220;The Chinese costs around Rs50,000, the Turkish between Rs50,000 to Rs1,00,000 and the Brazilian around Rs100,000. Prices for the rest range between Rs100,000 to Rs400,000. But looking for cheaper pistols, one can also go for the &#8216;Made in Pakistan&#8217; variety as we manufacture copies of all the big brands, in the range of around Rs15,000 to Rs20,000,&#8221; the weapon dealer shares.\n\nThe biggest local weapons manufacturers are now located in the Industrial Estate on Kohat Road in Peshawar. After the closing down of the illegal Darra Adam Khel weapons factories, most manufactures there have now got manufacturing licences and are making good quality guns legally.\n\nAs for the 9mm bullets and how much they cost, Afridi discusses all kinds and their prices. &#8220;There is the hydra shok bullet that explodes after penetration. It is the most dangerous and most expensive bullet, costing Rs500 each. Hollow-point is another kind of bullet that spreads in size after penetration and each bullet costs Rs100. Then the high-velocity subsonic bullet costs Rs150 each. This bullet with a blunt tip when shot can break hard surfaces. Finally, there is the ball ammo bullet with a full-metal jacket [FMJ]. The Chinese make is Rs36 each and local Rs20 each,&#8221; informs the expert, while adding that different guns have different magazine capacity with most carrying up to 15 bullets.\n\nIn comparison with the quality of local guns, which is not so bad, the local bullets are of poor quality. &#8220;They produce much smoke when fired and the corrosive residue left behind by these inside the weapon encourages rusting. They are poor in quality because they are cheap. The quality can be improved, like those manufactured at the Pakistan Ordinance Factory at Wah Cantt, of course, but then the price will go up,&#8221; the dealer concludes.', 1, 1, '61.5.135.163', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

Because of the moonlight you will be able to see the bird coming from a long distance away and your guide or your assistant will have to turn the search light on when you think that the bird is in your shooting range otherwise it will change the flight path and away from your shotgun range.\nThe most important thing is to have a search light with wider lens so the light disperses wider and you can estimate the lead and range.\nDo not put decoys in the water because shellducks , geese and mallards land on ground at night.\nYou need to be set and ready before 6.00 and hunt till 11 because after 11 the birds rest where they land till first light in the morning.\n\nAnother strategy which the locals use most in our area is to throw feed just before mughrib prayers for two days before hunting .', 1, 1, '39.41.125.91', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

A simple google search has shown that this is quite a common problem and people point towards using the safety lever for decocking as a possible cause. Truth be told I had a bad habit of cocking my gun (on an empty chamber of course) and decocking with the lever.\n\nThe broken lever looks exactly like the one shown in below given picture (of someone elses gun, taken off the internet):\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]22400[/ATTACH]\n\nThe safety still works but it takes a lot of effort to manipulate this "half" lever. However, I prefer to carry the gun without a round in the chamber and the safety off, so this functionality is not as important for me. \n\nThe more important issue I am facing is that the broken safety has made racking the slide a painful process. \n\nNeed suggestions from the seniors here on how can I get this issue fixed. The only 2 options I can think of are:\n\n1) Glue a piece of rubber so that my finger does not contact the rough metal\n2) Remove the safety lever entirely (is this even possible?)\n\nThanks in advance for any response!', 1, 1, '115.186.105.232', 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 'on_nl2br', 0, 0),

(375843, 11710, 0, 'ali87', 14144, 'An Alternate Look at Handgun Stopping Power', 1373386895, 'by Greg Ellifritz\n I''ve been interested in firearm stopping power for a very long time. I  remember reading Handguns magazine back in the late 1980s when Evan  Marshall was writing articles about his stopping power studies. When  Marshall''s first book came out in 1992, I ordered it immediately,  despite the fact that I was a college student and really couldn''t afford  its $39 price tag. Over the years I bought all of the rest of  Marshall''s books as well as anything else I could find on the subject. I  even have a first edition of [I]Gunshot Injuries[/I] by Louis Lagarde published in 1915.\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/graphics/cartridges.jpg[/IMG] [B]Are any of these better than another?[/B]\n \n Every source I read has different recommendations. Some say  Marshall''s data is genius. Some say it is statistically impossible. Some  like big heavy bullets. Some like lighter, faster bullets. There isn''t  any consensus. The more I read, the more confused I get.\n One thing I remember reading that made a lot of sense to me was an  article by Massad Ayoob. He came out with his own stopping power data  around the time Marshall published [I]Handgun Stopping Power[/I]. In  the article, Ayoob took his critics to task. He suggested that if people  didn''t believe his data, they should collect their own and do their own  analysis. That made sense to me. So that''s just what I did.  I always  had a slight problem with the methodology of Marshall and Sanow''s work.   For consistency purposes, they ONLY included hits to the torso and ONLY  included cases where the person was hit with just a single round.   Multiple hits screwed up their data, so they excluded them.  This led to  an unrealistically high stopping power percentage, because it factored  out many of the cases where a person didn''t stop!  I wanted to look at  hits anywhere on the body and get a realistic idea of actual stopping  power, no matter how many hits it took to get it.  So I started  collecting data.\n Over a 10-year period, I kept track of stopping power results from  every shooting I could find. I talked to the participants of gunfights,  read police reports, attended autopsies, and scoured the newspapers,  magazines, and Internet for any reliable accounts of what happened to  the human body when it was shot.\n I documented all of the data I could; tracking caliber, type of  bullet (if known), where the bullet hit and whether or not the person  was incapacitated. I also tracked fatalities, noting which bullets were  more likely to kill and which were not. It was an exhaustive project,  but I''m glad I did it and I''m happy to report the results of my study  here.\n Before I get to the details, I must give a warning. I don''t have any  dog in this fight! I don''t sell ammo.  I''m not being paid by any firearm  or ammunition manufacturer. I carry a lot of different pistols for self  defense. Within the last 2 weeks, I''ve carried a .22 magnum, a .380  auto, a .38 spl revolver, 3 different 9mm autos and a .45 auto.  I don''t  have an axe to grind. If you are happy with your 9mm, I''m happy for  you. If you think that everyone should be carrying a .45 (because they  don''t make a .46), I''m cool with that too. I''m just reporting the data.  If you don''t like it, take Mr. Ayoob''s advice...do a study of your own.\n A few notes on terminology...\n Since it was my study, I got to determine the variables and their definitions. Here''s what I looked at:\n - Number of people shot\n - Number of rounds that hit\n - On average, how many rounds did it take for the person to stop his  violent action or be incapacitated? For this number, I included hits  anywhere on the body.  To be considered an immediate incapacitation, I  used criteria similar to Marshall''s.  If the attacker was striking or  shooting the victim, the round needed to immediately stop the attack  without another blow being thrown or shot being fired.  If the person  shot was in the act of running (either towards or away from the  shooter), he must have fallen to the ground within five feet.\n I also excluded all cases of accidental shootings or suicides.  Every  shot in this study took place during a military battle or an  altercation with a criminal.\n - What percentage of shooting incidents resulted in fatalities. For this, I included only hits to the head or torso.\n - What percentage of people were not incapacitated no matter how many rounds hit them\n - Accuracy. What percentage of hits was in the head or torso. I  tracked this to check if variations could affect stopping power. For  example, if one caliber had a huge percentage of shootings resulting in  arm hits, we may expect that the stopping power of that round wouldn’t  look as good as a caliber where the majority of rounds hit the head.\n - One shot stop percentage - number of incapacitations divided by the  number of hits the person took. Like Marshall''s number, I only included  hits to the torso or head in this number.\n - Percentage of people who were immediately stopped with one hit to the head or torso\n Here are the results.\n [TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD] [B].25ACP[/B] # of people shot - 68\n# of hits - 150\n% of hits that were fatal - 25%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 2.2\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 35%\nOne-shot-stop % - 30%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 62%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 49% [/TD]\n[TD] [B].22 (short, long and long rifle)[/B] # of people shot - 154\n# of hits - 213\n% of hits that were fatal - 34%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 1.38\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 31%\nOne-shot-stop % - 31%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 76%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 60% [/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD] [B].32 (both .32 Long and .32 ACP)[/B] # of people shot - 25\n# of hits - 38\n% of hits that were fatal - 21%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 1.52\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 40%\nOne-shot-stop % - 40%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 78%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 72% [/TD]\n[TD] [B].380 ACP[/B] # of people shot - 85\n# of hits - 150\n% of hits that were fatal - 29%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 1.76\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 16%\nOne-shot-stop % - 44%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 76%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 62% [/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD] [B].38 Special[/B] # of people shot - 199\n# of hits - 373\n% of hits that were fatal - 29%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 1.87\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 17%\nOne-shot-stop % - 39%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 76%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 55% [/TD]\n[TD] [B]9mm Luger[/B] # of people shot - 456\n# of hits - 1121\n% of hits that were fatal - 24%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 2.45\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 13%\nOne-shot-stop % - 34%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 74%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 47% [/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD] [B].357 (both magnum and Sig)[/B] # of people shot - 105\n# of hits - 179\n% of hits that were fatal - 34%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 1.7\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 9%\nOne-shot-stop % - 44%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 81%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 61% [/TD]\n[TD] [B].40 S&W[/B] # of people shot - 188\n# of hits - 443\n% of hits that were fatal - 25%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 2.36\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 13%\nOne-shot-stop % - 45%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 76%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 52% [/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD] [B].45 ACP[/B] # of people shot - 209\n# of hits - 436\n% of hits that were fatal - 29%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 2.08\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 14%\nOne-shot-stop % - 39%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 85%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 51% [/TD]\n[TD] [B].44 Magnum[/B] # of people shot - 24\n# of hits - 41\n% of hits that were fatal - 26%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 1.71\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 13%\nOne-shot-stop % - 59%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 88%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 53% [/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD] [B]Rifle (all Centerfire)[/B] # of people shot - 126\n# of hits - 176\n% of hits that were fatal - 68%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 1.4\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 9%\nOne-shot-stop % - 58%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 81%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 80% [/TD]\n[TD] [B]Shotgun (All, but 90% of results were 12 gauge)[/B] # of people shot - 146\n# of hits - 178\n% of hits that were fatal - 65%\nAverage number of rounds until incapacitation - 1.22\n% of people who were not incapacitated - 12%\nOne-shot-stop % - 58%\nAccuracy (head and torso hits) - 84%\n% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 86% [/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n [B]Discussion[/B]\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Shots.png[/IMG]I  really would have liked to break it down by individual bullet type, but  I didn''t have enough data points to reach a level of statistical  significance. Getting accurate data on nearly 1800 shootings was hard  work. I couldn''t imagine breaking it down farther than what I did here. I  also believe the data for the .25, .32 and .44 magnum should be viewed  with suspicion. I simply don''t have enough data (in comparison to the  other calibers) to draw an accurate comparison. I reported the data I  have, but I really don''t believe that a .32 ACP incapacitates people at a  higher rate than the .45 ACP!\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_OneShot_Percent.png[/IMG]One  other thing to look at is the 9mm data. A huge number (over half) of  9mm shootings involved ball ammo. I think that skewed the results of the  study in a negative manner. One can reasonable expect that FMJ ammo  will not stop as well as a state of the art expanding bullet. I  personally believe that the 9mm is a better stopper than the numbers  here indicate, but you can make that decision for yourself based on the  data presented.\n\n\n Some interesting findings:\n I think the most interesting statistic is the percentage of people  who stopped with one shot to the torso or head. There wasn''t much  variation between calibers. Between the most common defensive calibers  (.38, 9mm, .40, and .45) there was a spread of only eight percentage  points. No matter what gun you are shooting, you can only expect a  little more than half of the people you shoot to be immediately  incapacitated by your first hit.\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Incapacitation.png[/IMG]The  average number of rounds until incapacitation was also remarkably  similar between calibers. All the common defensive calibers required  around 2 rounds on average to incapacitate. Something else to look at  here is the question of how fast can the rounds be fired out of each  gun. The .38 SPL probably has the slowest rate of fire (long double  action revolver trigger pulls and stout recoil in small revolvers) and  the fewest rounds fired to get an incapacitation (1.87). Conversely the  9mm can probably be fired fastest of the common calibers and it had the  most rounds fired to get an incapacitation (2.45). The .40 (2.36) and  the .45 (2.08) split the difference. It is my personal belief that there  really isn''t much difference between each of these calibers. It is only  the fact that some guns can be fired faster than others that causes the  perceived difference in stopping power. If a person takes an average of  5 seconds to stop after being hit, the defender who shoots a lighter  recoiling gun can get more hits in that time period. It could be that  fewer rounds would have stopped the attacker (given enough time) but the  ability to fire more quickly resulted in more hits being put onto the  attacker. It may not have anything to do with the stopping power of the  round.\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Rnds_to_Incap.png[/IMG]Another  data piece that leads me to believe that the majority of commonly  carried defensive rounds are similar in stopping power is the fact that  all four have very similar failure rates. If you look at the percentage  of shootings that did not result in incapacitation, the numbers are  almost identical. The .38, 9mm, .40, and .45 all had failure rates of  between 13% and 17%.\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Failure_to_Incap.png[/IMG]Some  people will look at this data and say "He''s telling us all to carry  .22s".  That''s not true.  Although this study showed that the  percentages of people stopped with one shot are similar between almost  all handgun cartridges, there''s more to the story.  Take a look at two  numbers: the percentage of people who did not stop (no matter how many  rounds were fired into them) and the one-shot-stop percentage.  The  lower caliber rounds (.22, .25, .32) had a failure rate that was roughly  double that of the higher caliber rounds.  The one-shot-stop percentage  (where I considered all hits, anywhere on the body) trended generally  higher as the round gets more powerful.  This tells us a couple of  things...\n\n In a certain (fairly high) percentage of shootings, people stop their  aggressive actions after being hit with one round regardless of caliber  or shot placement.  These people are likely NOT physically  incapacitated by the bullet.  They just don''t want to be shot anymore  and give up!  Call it a psychological stop if you will.  Any bullet or  caliber combination will likely yield similar results in those cases.   And fortunately for us, there are a lot of these "psychological stops"  occurring.  The problem we have is when we don''t get a psychological  stop.  If our attacker fights through the pain and continues to  victimize us, we might want a round that causes the most damage  possible.  In essence, we are relying on a "physical stop" rather than a  "psychological" one.  In order to physically force someone to stop  their violent actions we need to either hit him in the Central Nervous  System (brain or upper spine) or cause enough bleeding that he becomes  unconscious.  The more powerful rounds look to be better at doing this.\n One other factor to consider is that the majority of these shootings  did NOT involve shooting through intermediate barriers, cover or heavy  clothing.  If you anticipate having to do this in your life (i.e. you  are a police officer and may have to shoot someone in a car), again, I  would lean towards the larger or more powerful rounds.\n What I believe that my numbers show is that in the majority of  shootings, the person shot merely gives up without being truly  incapacitated by the bullet.  In such an event, almost any bullet will  perform admirably.  If you want to be prepared to deal with someone who  won''t give up so easily, or you want to be able to have good performance  even after shooting through an intermediate barrier, I would skip  carrying the "mouse gun" .22s, .25s and .32s.\n Now compare the numbers of the handgun calibers with the numbers  generated by the rifles and shotguns. For me there really isn''t a  stopping power debate. All handguns suck! If you want to stop someone,  use a rifle or shotgun!\n What matters even more than caliber is shot placement. Across all  calibers, if you break down the incapacitations based on where the  bullet hit you will see some useful information.\n Head shots = 75% immediate incapacitation\nTorso shots = 41% immediate incapacitation\nExtremity shots (arms and legs) = 14% immediate incapacitation.\n No matter which caliber you use, you have to hit something important in order to stop someone!\n [IMG]http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/publicfiles/Ellifritz_Accuracy.png[/IMG]\n [B]Conclusion[/B]\n This study took me a long time and a lot of effort to complete.  Despite the work it took, I''m glad I did it. The results I got from the  study lead me to believe that there really isn''t that much difference  between most defensive handgun rounds and calibers. None is a death ray,  but most work adequately...even the lowly .22s. I''ve stopped worrying  about trying to find the "ultimate" bullet. There isn''t one. And I''ve  stopped feeling the need to strap on my .45 every time I leave the house  out of fear that my 9mm doesn''t have enough "stopping power." Folks,  carry what you want. Caliber really isn''t all that important.\n Take a look at the data. I hope it helps you decide what weapon to  carry. No matter which gun you choose, pick one that is reliable and  train with it until you can get fast accurate hits. Nothing beyond that  really matters!\n You may also enjoy this Greg Ellifritz story: [URL="http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/node/8240"]A Parent''s Guide to School Shootings[/URL]\n [I]Greg Ellifritz is the full time firearms and defensive tactics  training officer for a central Ohio police department.

I shot some 15 pellets but was all over the place. Only a few within 3" circle. Got frustrated and packed up, shots on paper were so scattered that i did not even take a snap of it. When stress relieved a bit, I thought over my mistakes and found out that 1" black bulls eye was not properly visible from my sights at that distance, and target being under the shed, it was more difficult to align the tip of front sight with bulls eye. they were merging with each other hence my focus was out on almost every shot.\n\nI drafted a new colour target in MS Word, printed, and got started again. Out of first 7 shots I got a good close group of 6 on middle bulls eye. I was full of joy seeing my group from that distance with open sights.

Unlike the high powered springers such as the HW80 and above, it is not very hold sensitive, and in stable hands, its quite capable of bringing down pigeons as far as 50 yards away. \n\nThe best upgrade you could possibly do to this gun, once the original spring has been worn out, is to strip it down, disassemble it fully, degrease all the parts and then install a Jim Maccari kit (new spring, spring guide, seals and spring tar), and thoroughly re-lubricate it. I did that in my HW30 several years ago, and the HW30 felt like a totally different gun, it shot better - smoother, quieter and possibly faster than when I had first bought it. \n\nOne thing you might want to do is to try what ammo your HW50 likes best. My HW30 shot best RWS Superdomes.

Here''s how I see it:\n\nIn my opinion if you are going to buy a Duty, buy the newer version (that also comes in OD Green) since CZ has worked over some of the quirks that plagued earlier gen guns. But, if you do go for the newer models, they are a good 20k or so more expensive than the EZ-9. So, if you get the EZ9 you''ll save a bunch of money for ammo, tactical accessories etc. \n\nSecondly, the EZ-9 is a metal gun, and as much as I like the Duty, I''m not a big fan of polymer guns (unless they''re Glocks, HKs, S&Ws, Springfields, FNs and the like). \n\nThirdly, and something that many people fail to understand, is that Zastava has been making guns for over 150 years! Its an old world armoury that is very well respected and is often used for military contracts. The EZ-9s that have made their way to the States have also received nothing but praise. Its a tough, reliable, no-frills gun that is easy to disassemble and clean. And, if you do your bit, it is quite accurate too. \n\nSave your cash, buy the EZ-9.

It is very difficult, "almost" impossible to keep the consistency in a rifle like hold, but it is easier in an artillery hold. So, forget what the legend says, and keep practicing artillery hold.\n\nThere are per-requisites to ARTILLERY HOLD. a steady aim, relax mind and body, no extra tension in the muscles except the minimum needed to hold your rifle, breath holding, slow and steady squeeze of trigger and follow through, all are equally important. \n\nTo use a light hold (like artillery hold) effectively you need a "LIGHT TRIGGER". With a stiff 2nd stage, artillery hold does not give its maximum accuracy.  A hard trigger and a light hold can hardly go together. You need to work on the trigger to make it as light as possible. I have made 2nd stage very short and as light as I could on this trigger. ( this is tricky and dangerous, get maximum information about this trigger and then try it, very small change at a time, you should know what you r doing)\nKeep practicing, and remember this is not a PCP.

I use 50yds for zeroing and you use 60yds.\r\n\r\nI know with the help of your earlier posts that 60yds trajectory is ideal. Using of 50yds zero is because of quick and easy calculation for MOAs.\r\n\r\nFor example, If my rifle is zeroed at 60yds and suppose I am hitting a certain target about 4" low then as we know that at 100yds 1 MOA is 1". And at 60yds 1 MOA is 0.6". Now I have to calculate that how many MOA I need to fit in 4". And it''s about 6.66 MOAs. This final calculation is not easy without calculator.\r\n\r\nBut Now see If my rifle is zeroed at 50yds and suppose I am hitting a certain target about 4" low then as we know that at 100yds 1 MOA is 1" and at 50yds 1 MOA is 0.5". Now I have to calculate that how many MOAs I need to fit in 4". And it''s about 8 MOAs. It is very simple to calculate and there is no need of any device. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now changing my zeroing from 50yds to 60yds, I have to just make 3 small clicks for (0.79 MOA) because my riflescope is of 1/4 MOA clicks.

It gave me much more besides my unsolved questiones. Thanks (.22lr caliber) and thanks to all its lovers.\r\n\r\nOne thing which is annoying for me is that in our sweet country PAKISTAN there are lots of outdoors men but very few know the versatility of .22lr, And on the other hand when I surf the internet I observed that .22lr is first owned gun by every good hunter or shooter.\r\n\r\nI have some .22lr experiences and stories and would like to share in future.
