(547582, ' [QUOTE=LakersFan;385521]The Glock vs Sig debate is the same as the Polymer vs steel, the striker vs hammer, or the 1911 vs everything else :p debate. Its all a matter of personal preference. \n\nI, personally, prefer Sigs because they (in my opinion) look better, feel better, have a decocker, and are (mostly) made of metal and have an external hammer. This is not to say that a Glock (especially the Glock 17) is a bad gun, far from it actually. The Glock is reliable, dependable, and an extremely serviceable firearm. \n\nNow, coming to the Sig P250 vs Glock 17 debate. No, just...no. The Glock that you have is a far superior weapon in almost every aspect (not including fit and feel, which is completely subjective anyway). If it were a P226 or something along those lines, I''m afraid I''d have to side with your friend. :p O, and regarding accuracy, Glocks often outshoot their owners - nothing wrong with them if the shooter does his/her part. \n\n@Glock 17: Since you''ve already searched the market for Sigs, what kind of variety are we looking at over here? Apart from the ubiquitous P226 and its variants. Specifically, I''m interested in whether you''ve been able to find the Sig P938 or the P238 models. Lemme know and thanks![/QUOTE]\nActually I haven''t owned or used a Sig before. Just playing with one in a gun shop isn''t probably enough to make a decision. And yes, the debate is never ending specially once you aren''t siding either and being truly neutral. I had an option of a P250 and a P226. The P226 is Made in Germany and without a picatinny rail which is a "deal breaker" for me despite the fact I like how it looks. Hammer or striker, I''m more into the striker ones if its a Glock not Taurus. I don''t mind if a gun is based on a full sized frame or a compact, it has to be light weight. For me CC is all about the weight and design not the incremental size/dimension bumps. Sig P938 or the P238 models are not available at the moment.', ''),

In my case I got 500 POF 1z rounds from a shop in Wah Cantt and 500 2z fro a shop in Lahore; both unfortunately were 2 number re-loads and CZ''s were not comfortable at all with these.

(547751, 'Revolver Vs. Pistol Here is my take on the age old debate after carrying both as my EDC. \n\n[B]Reliability:[/B]\n\nHands down the innate simplicity of the revolver design makes it vastly superior to the pistol in the reliability department.  \nNo worries about faulty magazines, followers, spring pressure. No FTE issues or feeding problems. Broken ejectors or worries about which ammo the pistol &#8216;likes&#8217; FMJ or JHP or any specific brand. \nWith a wheel gun &#8220;you&#8221; decide what ammo type U like not the gun! You may load semi-wadcutters and she will not complain. \nEven if there is a failure to fire the shooter does not have to take &#8216;time out&#8217; in a gun fight and clear the dud round manually. With a revolver he simply continues shooting.\n\n[B]Simplicity[/B]\n\nFor a newbie to the fire arms world i almost always recommond a wheel gun over a pistol. its far more simpler to operate then a pistol \n\n[B]Choice:[/B] \n\nThe .357magnum can also fire the .38 spacial. My .32 S&W long can do .32 s&w short and in a pinch even .32 acp ( A pistol round)  However I can just imagine stuffing my  .32 revolver round in the .32 pistol! Boom if I ever were able to stuff it inside the gun!\n\n[B]Safety:[/B]\n\nIMHO one of the most crucial differences between the wheel gun and the pistol is that the pistol cycles a fresh round &#8220;after&#8221; it has been fired. While the revolver completes its cycle &#8220;before&#8221; discharge.\nHow does it affect the safety of the weapon?\n\nWell. The safest way to carry a firarm is condition 3 or chamber empty. Unfortunately if the stuff hits the fan. All you have to pull the trigger on a pistol suddenly all u get is a click.. U can go on clicking ad infinitum. Untill you charge the weapon manually u wont get anywhere. \nHowever, with a wheel gun even when there is an empty chamber under the hammer when you squeeze the trigger the piece will fire. The rotary mechanism will ensure there is a fresh round whenever the trigger is pulled.\n\n[B]Quantity vs. size:[/B]\n\nThe size of a pistol round is limited to the size of the grip. It is possible to stuff a .357magnum round in a desert eagle, but you would have to be a giant to conceal it let alone fire it comfortably.. if u have normal sized hands that is. It is a huge, heavy chunk of metal.  \nA titanium 7 shot .357 magnum Taurus snubbie can easily be dropped in an ankle holster and the owner will barely feel it is there!\nBesides, the chances are if you cant do something with 7 or 8 .357 magnum rounds, you probably wont get a chance to do with 17 9mm rounds either. \n\n[B]Ease of handling:[/B]\n\nI have used both as my EDC. But I found the task of unloading the chamber every time I came back home and then re-stuffing the 17th round back in the magazine, odious at best.  I stopped abusing my thumb nail and simply shifted to my revolver.  I also don&#8217;t have to worry about spring fatigue anymore. \n\n[B]More tolerance for different gripping styles[/B]\n\ni have yet to see a wheel gun fail to fire/extract due to limp wristing or injuring a thumb or fingers  because the shooter allowed it to hover close to the slide. \n\n(I made such an error once and am lucky my thumb is intact) \n\n[B]Security[/B]\n\nIt also does not leave ''calling'' cards behind on the scene of an incident. I like my brass with me not strewn all over the road. \n\n[B]you get what u are promised[/B]\n\none more edge a revolver has over pistol, in revolvers you get exact barrel length you are promised with same length of rifling not like pistols where length of chamber (a feed ramp as well in CZ''s case) is deducted from advertised barrel length \n\nThere was an incident when me and my friends were coming back from French beach and on the way back on the Mauripur road we saw a bunch of moter bikers crusing slowly.  I immediately charged my 9mm pistol&#8230; Or tried to at any rate. I fumbled and the slide got stuck half way. It took me a good 10 minutes to clear the jam. Luckily for me my friend and his wife. The bikers were just a bunch of kids coming back from the beach. But I learnt my lesson that day.  \nAnd shifted to the wheel gun for serious SD work.', ''),

(547859, ' In my opinion that definitely falls into the myth that anything mechanical is better if its German made. My interest in them is primarily historical, since there is no more West Germany, it''s just cool to have one with those markings. But mechanically, there are a couple reasons I prefer the newer ones. First, with the early 226''s there was a design flaw with the trigger bar spring that caused it to wear into the frame. It''s a looped piece of metal the size of a paper clip under the right side grip. Second, the new ones have machined slides vs stamped. Not everything milled is better, but in this case I believe it is, for the sake of rigidity. \n\nThat reminds me of an article I once read about an analysis of AKs with stamped vs milled receivers. In America, milled AKs command quite a premium, not only due to their increased cost to produce, but  for their (perceived) superior quality. However in testing, the stamped versions proved to be more accurate and reliable. It was due to the fact that the original design incorporated the flex afforded by a stamped sheet metal receiver. Apparently when you take such a major component that was specifically designed to bend, and make it rigid, the harmonics of the entire rifle from stock to muzzle is thrown off. As a result, performance was adversely affected.', ''),

But most and everyday situations a revolver is best, very safe yet all you need to do is pull it out and squeeze the trigger.

(BTW which revolver is that? the one u posted the pic of)\nAlso being a newb, what do the terms like SA, DA, SAO mean?\n\nI honestly think its upon people, generally i think a revolver would be best option. (Taurus offers a lot of easily concealable ones.) On the other hand if you come from a big and known family, more firepower may be beneficial as you may be a target, And other unusual circumstances like that. But most and everyday situations a revolver is best, very safe yet all you need to do is pull it out and squeeze the trigger. Pistols dont offer that, for the common man here who doesnt wanna get robbed of his valuables, all he needs is a few rounds at the ready, as ED said [B]"[COLOR=#333333]Generally if the threat is not neutralised in the 1st 7-8 shots. the chances are the GG is. neutralised that is." [/COLOR][/B][COLOR=#333333]Even with a pistol with 17 rds, chances are by the time youve fired 5-6 shots, either you or him has done some damage. \nIn real life things dont go down like in the movies, you dont fall down bleeding out of your abdomen and all the same time have reloaded and resume firing where youve fallen which somehow also happens to be a great defensive firing position. if hit in a gun fight, an everyday guy will probably start shitting bricks, (Go into shock or worse) and the gun fight will be over.\nHaving more ammo is no doubt a good thing, but NORMALLY you would not need it. Like i said, if circumstances are different and you have reason to believe you need more firepower then yes a wheelie will surely not be beneficial.[/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nSA is single action. I.e u have to pull the hammer back before u fire. The TT is an SA pistol. For the first round u have to pull back the hammer and for subsequent rounds the hammer is pulled back hte the force of the recoil. So its always SA. \n\nIn an SA revolver u have to manualy pull back the hammer before every round is fired. But there are almost combat SA revolvers aropund. \n\nmost are DA. I.e U pull the hammer and simply ''touch'' the trigger. or u keep the hammer down and have to pull the trigger all the way back.\n\nSA means the trigger simply releases the hammer while double action means the trigger has to both pull back the hammer and  release it as well. \n\nSAO is single action only and DAO is double action only. That is U dont have the option of pulling back the hammer yourself. But have to press the trigger to both pull back the hammer and release it (DAO).  \n\nMy wheel gun is the Arminius HW 5 7 shot made in Germany. With a 4 inch  barrel. its a DA revolver.

But in the instance, the Five-Seven''s price is not directly indicative of its quality. As 380 mentioned, it''s claim to fame is the 5.7 round. Since NATO nations decided not to replace the 9mm with the 5.7 as standard issue, ammo is scarce and expensive, and also because the ammo available to civilians is not armor piercing (nullifying any significant ballistic advantage it may have had, making it kind of a different just for the sake of being different cartridge), demand for the gun is consequently low. You know how many millions of US$ it takes to design, test, advertise, and tool up a factory to produce a new gun... they have to pay for all that somehow. So if FN isn''t selling millions of guns, they just have to make more on each one they do sell. Simple.

I personally tried and tried to somehow make the bullet jam in their slides but failed to do so until I had to literally do it manually and deliberately..\n\n\nIf you rack the slide properly you will never ever face the loading issue... and[COLOR=#ff0000][B] On a Very Serious Note [/B][/COLOR]I strictly recommend that you do not try the loading unloading with real bullets specially if you don''t have much experience in fire arm handling.... Get Snap Caps and practice Slide Racking, Magazine Loading and trigger pull... you get a pack of 5 snap caps for anywhere between Rs 1200 to 1500..\n\nHope that solves your problem... be safe and shoot safer', ''),

Everything worked flawlessly, no FTE/FTF and ejection etc issues and all mags were emptied with gun locking in reload position every time. Total of 93 bullets fired (1 in chamber and 15 in mag for first fire). Each magazine was fired twice first before moving to 2nd and 3rd. \n\nMain difference and give away is the magazine plate, original is thicker (pictures to follow soon). That gives it up as a clone, other than that it is not easy to differentiate as finishing is very good. I need to weigh the empty mags on a digital machine to see the weight differences.\n\nAll 3 mags are fully loaded with 15 bullets each to keep the springs fully pressed, and I will do another test in a month or so to see if any issues creep up.

(548421, ' Diesel is perfectly fine for cleaning steel and aluminium. I have rebuilt a few car engines, with some steel cylinders and others with alu, after reboring to to take larger sized pistons & or to increase compression ratios. Diesel has always been the choice of cleaning engine internals and externals, air intakes etc. it has no impact on combustion and combustion chambers (that have much higher combustion temps than any pistol), you may get white smoke initially after the first start up but that goes away after a while. Petrol is not advised as a cleaner, due to moving parts that have oil such as cams. Although I have never cleaned a revolver with diesel, but based on my experience working on race car engines my vote is for cleaning with Diesel.\n\nAs for WD40, I''d personally use a good quality gun oil with a clean rag and one gets as good a shine, if not better than with WD40. WD40 is for nuts and bolts imo, and was designed for lubricating outer nuts and bolts of machinery for easier assembly/disassembly, never for the internal mechanisms or external mechanisms exposed to high temps and combustion.

They are the ones that are more at risk from criminals/predators (99 % of them men) and more in need of protection / self defense. When men are out working/busy earning a living it''s our women who are left protecting our home and children.

Her favourite is the Cougar and P22Q (she''s on the secondary on the licence for P22Q so carries it when required - just need to get the original laser for it to make it quicker for her to aim and shoot in low light / night situation), and loves firing the 2 shotguns (1 semi-auto, and other an inherited pre-independence double barrel shotgun).\n\nLet''s see how she responds to the PT617T .357 Magnum, she has yet to fire that. I already have her name on the 2 stuck MOI applications and when they reopen and DNs received I''d the transfer of the .357 on to one of the new licences.', ''),

(548738, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;386473]Lol at your ''predicament'' but happy that your spouse is interested in getting a CC permit. I deeply wish that women in Pakistan stop seeing firearms as a ''male domain'' and adopt it as part of their lives.\n\nIn my humble opinion it is as important for women as men if not more to be as proficient and well trained in firearm use then men in Pakistan. They are the ones that are more at risk from criminals/predators (99 % of them men) and more in need of protection / self defense. When men are out working/busy earning a living it''s our women who are left protecting our home and children. I would love to see the day when our sisters are as well armed as we are and infact get licenses, weapons and proficient firearms training much easier then men.\n\nTaking advantage of this post/thread, I would like to request my fellow PakGuns brethren to introduce/train your wives/sisters/daughters in educated and proficient gun use. Please teach them how to defend themselves, your home and children when you''re not there.[/QUOTE]\n\nYou are right although this seems appropriate for women in Western nations since they''ve been given the opportunity to co-exist as equal members of the society without gender bias or discrimination of rights, no matter how forward thinking we may have become in Pakistan there are still taboos in our society which lead to gender inequality and hence certain things are never expected from or taught to girls from an early age. Firearms is one dept. women in our society would hesitate to adopt and even if we did try to teach them it can never be second nature for them, because since childhood we see "toy guns for boys barbies for girls" . Moreover, I feel that the majority of women (not all) are more prone to panic attacks in scenarios such as robbery or street crime and emotional outbursts (while CCing a weapon getting into an argument, fight etc.), this can cause more harm than good when handling firearms, while for us loading a magazine, chambering and deactivating a safety, fixing a jam may seem trivial but for them its not so easy to pull this off smoothly in an emergency situation, unless they are fully trained by professionals in line of work (Police force, FBI, army etc.). For guys we have been playing with toy guns, then BB guns, men also tend to watch more action films then women so some basic knowledge gets transferred to us every now and then even if we own firearms or not.\n\nNot trying to sound chauvinist here, but its a sad fact about our culture, granted there may be 1-5% women who may become proficient at handling firearms, but for the rest its just a lump of metal lying in a purse like jewellery if they have it, I wouldn''t be surprised if I saw a Hello Kitty sticker on a Walther PPK, or may be pink glitter decorating on a Taurus Slim in a woman''s handbag or worse nail polish and perfume spilled into the guns. \n\nAgain these are just my personal opinions, not meant to offend anyone, for all I know, a lot of guys may be even worse in self defense situations, and definitely a lot of men who shouldn''t be owning weapons have them ( exapmle Mr. Sikandar of Islamabad in this regard).\n\nIf you feel your better half/sister/mother is 100% capable of handling herself in SD and can maintain her composure then by all means buy her the best gun you can, otherwise its not recommended.', ''),

I am not comfortable with C&L position while carrying, therefore I chose P01 for carry over Compact & Glock19.\nIn shooting I prefer to shoot 75 compact over P01 because of its weight, I got back on target much quicker than with P01.\n\nIn the end I will say both are great carry guns.. not just carry but range guns as well.. its one own preference of choosing one over other.. I can''t choose one between these two.. its either no one or both of them.\n\nRegards', ''),

I always do demos to my sisters & my better half how to handle & fire a weapon (Specially handguns and pump action shotgun, not the PB stuff).. my sisters are almost trained by now, but I am worried about my better half as she has not enough power to rack the slide of hand gun so bought her a snubby .32 S&W Revoler as she is afraid of high power 38, .357 calibers.. now another problem is that she can''t pull the trigger of this revolver in DA, so I taught her to rack the hammer first and then the fire in single action mode (Thanks God she can rack the hammer).. now the interesting part is that on pump actions she can rack its forward grip but is afraid of its recoil.. once I bought her a CZ92 in 25 caliber and that''s the only pistol she was able to rack the slide, but unfortunately as it is also a DAO gun, she was unable to pull its trigger..\n\nNow I must say my wife is driving me crazy because of the reason mentioned above other than the reason mentioned by OP.. so everybody''s wife drive their husband crazy in one way or the other.', ''),

(549030, ' Bad deal, but thats why guns have warranties right? Because nothing is perfect, especially man made mechanical things, and parts will break now and then. There''s no way the shooter would have been hurt, unless he needed to stop a deadly threat at that moment. But it was just part of the cam track that broke. Its purpose is to move the barrel and locking lug in and out of lock up with the slide. So even without the entire track, the slide will not fly off the frame. Recoil, and thus ammo, has hardly any impact on the longevity of barrel cams because they do not absorb any shock. Obviously the cycling of the gun caused it to break, but its also obviously a faulty part. So even if the owner had not fired that shot, but just racked the slide a couple more times by hand, that probably would have been enough to cause the breakage. By all means, CZ should be contacted but they''ll most likely say... sorry you got a bad part, what''s your address or who''s your dealer, we''ll send you a new barrel. No big deal.', ''),

It is unbelievably costly e.g., 25000/- PKR per day per person for wild bore hunting that to only if you have four members.\n2. You can not hunt Urial legally in Jhelum if you are a Pakistani. Yes Sir, no way.\n3. Ibex hunt is possible for a Pakistani in northern Areas if you are willing to pay 3,50,000/- per trophy.\n4. You can hunt Sindh Urial at similar cost being a Pakistani.\n5. Pakistan Guides acquires permits for all these hunting adventures to make this activity completely legal.\n\nI wanna enquiry the authorities, is it ok to have such rules and high permit prices? We all know that all of above can be undertaken at much cheaper rates. All you need is a rifle and local contacts.

Its not going to affect the ammo, but when you shoot them it will have a negative affect on your guns and magazines by getting oil where there should be no oil, and that will cause dirt to collect and build up in those places. Anyways, modern ammo is very good for long term storage and weather sealing. Ive left a cartridge outside in winter, exposed to rain, snow, and sun for a month, and it still fired when I shot it. Afterwards, quite a few people whom I told went and tried for themselves and all of their rounds still fired. Also, I regularly use Russian surplus ammo from the 50''s and I''ve never experienced a dud round. With one of the oldest crates I''ve had, there were quite a few cartridges that feel noticeably lighter when shooting, but I haven''t had one fail me yet.\nAnyways, just store your ammo in a cool dry place and they should last forever.[/SIZE][/FONT][/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

That thing could have been put together by any one of the dozen beretta makers at that specific factory and there is no chain of evidence showing which gunsmith it was.  Now for the technical stuff.  The Beretta has a two piece firing pin.  There is the striker front section and there is the other section which sits in the safety and rotates when the safety is activated.  When the safety is off the two pins must align properly in a straight line...  Sometimes this is a problem as this is not the case.  Then there is the firing pin safety plunger issue.  As the trigger is pressed there is a plunger which pops up out of the slide - internally it is releasing the firing pin to strike forward against the cartridge.  This sequence can be close enough to work sometimes but is still not proper.  These are the two common problem.  The third and last with these desi junk pistols is FTF.', ''),

Those are the guns I train with the most and they represent all the major platforms (striker, SA/DA and SA only). I''ve been doing it for 13 years because in 2000 is when I took my first fighting pistol class, and the instructor told us to practice that way. So I picked up a habit, I draw, change mags, and fire at figures on TV. Let''s say over the last decade there was an average of 300 days/year I watched tv. Throughout an evening I would pull the trigger about 50 times. That makes 150,000 dry fires between six guns (because I try to keep two of those models mentioned). I shoot about 1-200 rounds a month, change springs every five years (sometimes less) and I''ve never broke a firing pin, or anything else for that matter. In fact the only part of a gun I''ve ever had break was a dust cover on an AR, and a rear back up sight on the same AR. \n\nJust buy quality, and use your guns the way you want to use them.

Pakistan is pitched in the war against terrorism. There is already proliferation of weapons primarily due to the weapons being smuggled from the western borders.

There are always teething problems and later user related errors with every product available in the market today. From state-of-the-art USAF F-22 Raptor crashes to multiple airbags Mercedes Benz killing Diana. From the sinking of Titanic to destruction of the great Hindenburg. Now lets come over to the issue here.\nWe all are screaming out loud that its the weapon and not the ammo. Just a simple question, how many of us are going to continue to play soccer if there is an ankle sprain. Would you still give a patient some a no-name cheap medicine to cut the cost because: Hey!! the guy at the pharmacy said, its as good as the real thing? [B]Seriously? I mean, seriously? [/B]When all of us are well aware that there is something about the A series Duty handguns, when some of us don''t know how strip/assemble a gun let alone service it and see for obvious faults, then why the heck would we be trying out a not-so-favourite "Chinese ammo". Of course everybody says its fine, just gets your gun dirty so no big deal, we''ll clean the gun more frequently. Doesn''t anyone raise an eyebrow just once as to why the weapon gets dirtier, more flash and smoke than from known brands with some quality control.\nI stand by the fact that that first off [B]metallurgy was at fault[/B]. But the lug just did not snap like that. That problem was in the handgun for some time and had the owner been more careful in inspecting his firearm during routine stripping and cleaning, he would have identified the problem long before this thing happened. The bulge issue was even in my 1000+ mixed rounds fired CZ. But it did not give me a single malfunction. What do you guys think of those 1000+ rounds fired all were HydraShoks and S&B alone? You are right, 35% was the red box (acquired from a reputable source). \nHow many green leaves would the owner have saved by the end of the day. It depends. More frequent shooting and you should consider the ammo (provided it is not re-loaded and acquired from the right source). Moderate or less frequency the use of the handgun and you are probably better off with the name-brand ammo.\n\nAt the end of the day, [B]One: the 85K handgun wasted and Two: It could have caused serious to fatal injury [COLOR=#ff0000]at the cost of saving few thousands in the long run.

You are a mod and have a right to politely correct (if needed) a member. But in no way to ridicule someone. Please make no mistake about it.\n\nMy point is exactly what the others are saying that its bad metallurgy of this particular piece but the bad part has been aggravated by ammo, the standard and quality control of which we don''t know. When the pressure builds, it exerts on all directions (in general) and weakens an already bad part. The more you use that ammo, the weaker the metallurgy gets at an accelerated pace. I have experience with airframe structural engineering and hope to have a small portion of a say in this regard. And a lug is very much a part of the barrel despite being outside. I guess its not that hard for a senior mod to understand after all and its been great learning for you.\n\nPlease keep this post intact for sometime for everyone to read before you delete it and think of something else.', ''),

(549732, ' 380, I am just as confused as you about the Glock situation. Yes in America we pay much more for full autos. But there is a reason. The [B]entire class[/B] of weapons has become restricted. [B]No more[/B] new pieces for civillian purchase, and so there is a fixed supply. In fact, you can say the supply is diminishing, for when those guns break, you can''t just go get a new frame, and when collectors buy up the nicer guns, they are to put away in private collections, never to be released on the market again. So that market is comparablr to collectible classic cars. But like you pointed out, in PK [B]pistols[/B] are freely available, yet why are the prices of [B]some[/B] makes/models seem to vary so [B]indiscriminately[/B]? It''s not logical.\n\nAnyways, with regards to the notorious red box, the situation again is opposite to what I''m used to. We actually seek out the old surplus 30 bore ammo because they are hotter (and cheaper). Just like how people here want 5.56 and 7.62x51NATO over their civilian .223 and .308 counterparts because of the more powerful loading. We also see nothing wrong with reloads since many people (myself included) reload our own ammo. Many do it for cost savings, but precision shooters do it also for more precise control of the components. I would think if reloads were being mixed in to cheat people, they would be made with less or lower grade powders and primers, making for a weaker round. To me, it makes no sense to cheat someone and give them more.', ''),

Because of little space at shell ejection port (being in between the two factory made rails), he could not install a one piece mount so instead he installed a Chinese two piece mount (the one with two Allen screws in each mount''s base). He was able to zero his gun in 4 rounds and shot a bottle of Flagyl syrup :D from a distance of 225 yards with straight trajectory and without the use of the mildots on the scope.

Originally developed in 1918-1920 as a cartridge for a large caliber AA / anti-armor machine gun, it was standardized by US Army in 1921 along with Browning M1921 heavy machine and is still in active service. \n \n[B]12.7x108mm [/B]\nThis round was developed in USSR by early 1930s especially for the new heavy machine guns, to be used in ground support and AA roles, and latter also in aircraft armaments. Originally chambered in Soviet DShK-38 heavy machine gun, it was used in the same roles as the NATO .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) cartridge. The 12.7x108mm can be used to engage a wide variety of targets on the battlefield, and will destroy unarmored vehicles, penetrate lightly armored vehicles and damage external ancillary equipment. \n  \n[B]14.5x114mm[/B]\nThis formidable cartridge was developed in USSR shortly before WW2 for use in antitank rifles. While those rifles became obsolete by the 1942, it was decided to develop a machine gun firing this ammunition, to use it against low-flying combat air-crafts and various lightly armored ground targets.\n\n[B]20x110mm Hispano-Suiza[/B]\nThe 20x110 Hispano was originally an AAA round. And it was also one of the most widely used 20mm cannons on WW2 aircrafts. The 20x110mm round (nowadays used in RT-20, a Croatian anti-material and anti-armor rifle) fires the 130gram (2000 grains) projectile at muzzle velocity of about 850 m/s.', ''),

It''s fine to have a different name for different calibers, if that''s the model strategy. Like how Glock has a different name for every size and every caliber.

[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[QUOTE=380ACP;387838]Fudgepacker i would like to know your opinion on p08 duty, why it was introduced but never launched ?[/QUOTE]\nYou know, it is awful strange. I just thought they determined there was no market for an 07 that''s a little longer and has different back straps and whatever, but analysis of the market should be one of the first things to consider, not the last thing after the gun has been intro''d. In my mind, that calls into question quality issues with the p08 more than it does the p07. If there was something questionable about a particular model, i am confident CZ would issue a recall rather than release a mew model to replace it. \n\nBut regardless, I never gave it a second thought because I was never interested in the Duty line anyways. Only CZ pistol I have is the Shadow. CZ is famous for their metal guns, so thats what I bought. Plus, their polymer just doesnt feel like quality to me. That''s only my subjective opinion however, just like Sig polymer doesn''t feel quality to me either but I have no data to prove it. But that doesn''t matter, because my opinion is all I need to decide not to buy a gun.\n\nOn that topic however, I would actually prefer a polymer frame over an aluminum. Once again, thats just a personal preference, I feel more comfortable with the durability of polymer regardless of what the "facts" are. Only reason I buy Sigs is because of their brand reputation. Between a Mossberg 590 and Remington 870, where I feel equal about their reputations, Remington with their steel receiver got my money.', ''),
(550103, ' Almost all 9mm ammunition meets SAAMI (USA), CIP (European) or NATO spec.  The specifications are virtually identical.  Any military surplus not from a NATO member will still be very close.  Ammunition manufacturers stay inside these specifications; if they stray outside, they''re liable for lawsuit should someone be injured, or they will not be paid for government contract ammunition that doesn''t met spec.\r\n\r\n When someone places an order for boxes, cases, pallets, or shiploads of ammunition from a source outside Pakistan, they get what''s in the warehouse or the next ammunition that comes off the loading line.  There''s no "made for Pakistan" ammunition.  What Winchester, Prvi, Norinco, or Wolf ship is the same, worldwide.\r\n\r\n Any ammunition that has different dimensions or falls outside of the pressure standards is probably counterfeit.\r\n\r\n The pictures of the CZ show a barrel lug failure.  Though it''s *possible* that excessively powerful or defective ammunition caused the failure, it''s most likely from a flaw in the metal or from improper heat treat.  Sometimes stuff like that happens, no matter how rigorous your quality control process is.  \r\n\r\n Lack of cleaning and presence of dirt or gunpowder residue would not cause such a failure.\r\n\r\n In some countries, it is standard policy for manufacturers to exchange kaboomed guns for replacements or cash, sometimes also with a release of liability for damages.   It''s worth contacting CZ directly and reporting the failure, with pictures, and asking if they will replace the gun.  The worst they can do is say no or ignore you.', ''),

There''s no "made for Pakistan" ammunition...[/QUOTE]\nThat''s 100% true... in the United States. There are many countries in the world where you would be surprised at how business is done. Lawsuit from injury is is another US phenomenon. Maybe, maybe not in PK, but there are a lot do other countries, when you buy something as hazardous as a firearm and ammo, it''s all on you, you don''t want to get hurt then don''t buy it. Also, do you know for a fact there is no "made for Pakistan ammunition". I know for a fact that there are countries where an item is either manufactured to "export quality" or to local quality. This could be anything from food items to electronics. Export quality is for countries who want certain quality levels, locals may have use cheaper materials or looser tolerances.\n\nLiability and standards are as foreign to some people, as a fake egg is to you. Yes, an artificial egg that looks, feels, smells just like a farm fresh free range chicken egg (until you cook it and eat it) and they can be produced for cheaper than having a live chicken lay one for you. Pretty weird, for the west, but not so much in the east. I''ll give you another example, I was at a market in Asia and was watching a guy buy a TV. After the options and size and what not were decided on, then came the brand. One TV could be any brand you wanted. The merchant asked the customer what brand he preferred so he could attach the badges and stickers. Weird huh? It''s one thing for us to say yeah, that''s weird, but  judgement can not be passed. Like i used to, some may say wow, I feel sorry for any one who has to live like that. But no one needs pity, in this same country is where I met a man who lives out on a farm. He has a pretty big house, and next to it another house about the size of your average 4 bedroom in the suburbs. Guess what the second house is for? Lets just say its not a guest house. It is stacked from floor to ceiling, corner to corner with cash. He told me his only money problems are mould and rats. He has more money that literally rots away than I make in a year. My point is, the western world can''t use their system of laws, ethics, standards, and concepts to tell the rest of the world what should be or could be.', ''),

(550120, ' [QUOTE=Shahbazyousuf;388075]Salam to all pakgun users. Since my last post I''ve waited to increase my budget and have increased it to 80 k since I want one good pistol for personal use and will not change it at least for a couple of years. I was recommended pistols in the 40 to 50 k price range by Ed brother and jawad brother previously which helped a lot on my knowledge. With 80k I feel I can get a pistol which is on a different level. \nIve been searching for tp9 and cz999-ez9 in the Karachi market. Sorry to bother you guys again but I want to be sure that with this new budget should I still pursue these pistols or are there better ones out there for a newbie like me to get with 80k for SD and HD? I''m looking for a pistol with complete /good safety features as well. Please recommend, thanks again.[/QUOTE]\n\nHmmm.. 80 is a nice figure. much nicer then 40k\n\nEZ 9 is a great gun. I have fired the cz 999 she is nice. However, the weapon is big heavy and bulky. more ever it does not have a manual safety. only a decocker. \n\nIts available for around 67k in Karachi \n\nU can get teh Taurus series for the weapon. I myself use a Taurus pt 92 clone. There are lots of accessories like extra mags. full wrap around grips. laser/light option. extremely reliable due to open slide design. \n\n[url]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=138&category=Pistol&toggle=&breadcrumbseries=[/url]\n\nIt has a key lock system. A frame mounted safety for added comfort. The safety lever has 3 positions. And unlike the berreta it has the ability of being carreid cocked and locked. \n\nThe lever can both decock and act as manual safety. \n\nThe downside the open slide design means that the barrel can get extremely hot after sustained shooting. While it does not effect the weapon in any way it will mean u have to be careful while handling the gun. \n\nIt is a big gun to conceal. I do conceal carry it at times but its a large weapon. \nit has been made on berreta mechinery. \n\nThe slightly compact version is called the 917c\n\nThen there is the 809 series. 3 grips for different hand sizes. magazine loader.\n\n[url]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=602&category=Pistol&toggle=&breadcrumbseries=[/url]\n\nTherei s a compact version of the same weapon available. \n\nThere is the G II 24/7 Taurus.\n[url]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=739&category=Pistol&toggle=&breadcrumbseries=[/url]\n\nSame as 809 but striker fired.\n\nALL of these weapons are 80k r so. \n\nShould u not like the Taurus range then there is the Turkish offerings\n\nThe Stoeger Cougar is 72k or so. And is basicaly a berreta  with Italian magazines. The stoeger has been aquired by berreta. So u are essentialy getting a Turkish berreta.\n\nVery reliable rotary berrel. 15 shot. \n\n[url]http://www.stoegerindustries.com/firearms/stoeger-cougar.php[/url]\n\nIt has a decocker/manual safety but cannot be carred cocked and locked. It also does not have the loaded chamber indicator that the taurus line does. \n\nAnd the new ones are without rails unfortunately :( \n\nThen there are teh Canik series of weapons. the TP 9 which u know about 70k  the C 100 64k\n\nCanik Shark 70k\n\nAll of them have either decockers ''or'' manual safeties not both.\n\nU can get a slightly used CZ 75 as well at this range. But again Either decocker or manual safety unlike the taurus and eth cougar in which U get both.\n\nThen of course there is hte Russian baikal 446 Viking. A veritable tank of a gun. With duel feed ramps its extremely reliable with all kinds of ammo.\n\nBut again very big and bulky. Since its designed as a side arm of the Russian Army. \n\nIt has a manual safety and can be carried cocked and locked. However it does not have a decocker and decoking it is not an easy job at all.', ''),

Moe than once I have come across Chinese scopes that refused to hold zero and drifted all over the place. Then I have also seen scopes with broken reticles, fogged up lenses, AO lenses that are not really adjustable. \n\nAs for the mounts, the less said the better. I have seen one that cracked and fell apart while the gun was being zeroed. Furthermore, most mounts are for from truly round an concentric. \n\nIn my humble view, a rifle, a scope and mounts are all investments, and while one can get away with a mediocre rifle, one should always buy the best optics and mounting hardware that one can afford. One every single shot counts, then you need to invest in the best that you can afford.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Turumti,\n\nYou are absolutely right. The best standard is that one should invest double amount on scope + mount than the cost of the gun.  And the least standard is that the cost of scope + mount should be at least half the cost of the gun.\n\nAnything out of this bracket may go South any time.\n\nThat is why I asked if someone is going for big game.

Around three AM through her rickshaw driver.\nAs regards why she was so friendly with the member.  Well on Eid she was picked up along with most of the other kids there by the DHA vigilance squad who claimed that they were going to hand them over to the Edhi centre.  \nAll well enough, but for one thing. The male kids managed to escape from the squad vehicle but they were holding on to the girl. The member&#8217;s younger brother jumped into the vehicle and they took pointed their weapons on him, nothing loathe, his people joined him as well.\n\nBut he refused to let them take the kid. Again the question is that they were ok with the male kids leaving but were willing to go to war in the middle of a busy street rather then let the female child go!!\n\nShe was extremely grateful! \n\nBut that does not mean that there is room for complacence. Remember she is essentially alone till 3 in the morning, right there on the streets with only her kid brother to take care of her. The brother can hardly be 7 himself. \n\nThe esteemed member has talked to the &#8216;lady&#8217; who handles this batch of kids. And is already paying the brother to ensure that he does not get involved in unhealthy activities.  The kid runs errands for him and is happy. \nBut the little girl is a prime earner and the &#8220;lady&#8221; claims that she earns between Rs. 500 to 1000 per day for her.  She will not take the kid off the streets till that amount is recovered every month.\n\nI have pledged Rs. 3k per month as has the esteemed member in question.  Thorny issues such as her schooling and her future can wait. Right now the priority is to GET HER OFF THE STREETS!  PERIOD! FULLSTOP!\nEvery night is a ticking time bomb.  I would like to appeal to the forum for both help and advice in this regard.[/QUOTE]\n\nThis will not stop or change anything. 3k a month will make you feel better but in the end will put 2 other small girls at risk when the "madam" hires more help with the money. We as brown people fail to ever see the big picture. Why do you think there are beggars on the street and their tummies putruding? Because this country feeds the lazy and unproductive. Put together that 3k and donate to a school that teaches street kids off the street, who have a better setup than a few rich kids trying to clean their conscious. They need your time to guide them, money they beg and get, food they stand outside selanis and eat probably better than me. Find out organizations which have the gist of what the bigger problem is and spend an hour a week with them. Maybe if you are lucky you will see a change in the next 20 years in a few lives that directly affect you where you walk, other than that everytime you see a window go down and 10 bucks go out the window that is whats causing that little girl to do the same thing. Otherwise lets not trouble the situation worse than it is. It is heartless, but so is this world who abuse our good nature tied with ignorance.', ''),

Plus I love the CZ people... CZ & CANIK people...  LONG LIVE THE PIRANHAs... lolz.\n\nHere is something else to add to the craziness; do you all know that most of the ammo imported here is generally the old stuff...  They get it cheap and sell it here at a premium.  Ammo is the best money maker.  The chinese ammo - they just want to hear a yes from the exporter thats it nothing else.  There is surplus ammo being sold EVERYWHERE, see Lithuania they have surplus everything for sale.  These dealers get them in together there are the groups.  Has anyone noticed a specific foul smell that sometimes comes from firing S&B lately; also the cartridge casings are of changed color.  These are common signs of old surplus ammo.  NOWAY does the cartridge casing go bad or change color this quick.  As for Chinese stuff, one side says yes to make the sale and the other side just says give.  Most of these dealers don''t even know what grain charge to pick up.  I remember here in Pindi they were selling the lighter faster 115gr S&B, I told them I wanted the heavier 124gr and the guys didn''t know what the heck I was babbling about till I explained it to him.\nSo watch the ammo.\n\nAs for the guns I will say again... whether local or imported - whether in Pakistan or Elsewhere Globally - when someone KNOWINGLY, WILLFULLY, And INTENTIONALLY purchases an item/firearm that causes an explosion within it to expel something/bullet.

The 446 reminds me of a CF 98, with the ambi controls, I actually find them quite appealing along with the MP 161. So everytime at the range, I''m actually always looking out to see if anyone has one I can try... no luck yet though. \n\nI found a new MP 18 in .308 online for $200 (20,000PKR) a while ago and I was sooo close to buying it, but I decided not to due to my lack of experience and knowledge of the brand.

The total amount would''ve been around 24-25K...!!! Basically he wanted to have the whole chicken rather than a golden egg... So I contacted another dealer and he got it done in 9K... The breakdown goes like this: 1K for the bore change, 5K for the receipt which one needs to have in order to get it entered in the DC''s office and the rest 3K was to enter the gun on the licence and then in the DC''s office which couldn''t cost 3K but I ignored it as there was a big difference between 25K and 9K... ;-)[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nWhy 5k for receipt????', ''),

There was a screw driver (seems useless), a wrench (for adjusting alignment maybe??), 4 rubbery thingys (will call them fillers) (to attach to the main bore sight for fitting inside different calibre barrels), the main laser sighter and an extra screw..\n\nI tried it on my Makarov first, one of the fillers did fit in snugly, and since they r rubbery, they can be expanded. Two smaller ones were lose and the biggest one was too big.\n\nThen I put in the batteries and switched it on. The alignment wasn''t right. Although the boresighter was snug, when I rotated the boersighter, the laser dot also rotates! (should stay in same place). Tried it with my 7mm rifle, same thing.\n\nI was hesitant to use the wrench to adjust the alignment, (the booklet claimed adjusting the alignment will "void" the warranty.. as if chinese products shipped from across the world do have warranties. lols) but since the dot was already misaliged, I tried it anyways.. couldnt figure it out, yet.. so closed it in frustation. \n\nWill probably try again tommorow. Love the concept, universal bore sighter, but seriously it could have been better!\n\nI also found bullet bore sighters (e.g. [url]http://www.amazon.com/5-56x45mm-Caliber-Cartridge-Sighter-Boresighter/dp/B002OKWHVO/ref=pd_bxgy_sg_img_z[/url]) but since they were a little expensive and i would have required different for each calibre, I didnt order them.

He was very helpful and opened the whole pistol for my inspection. Mags take full 8 rounds with no jams/ftfeed when chambering with hand. A 1/5th cock of hammer with chambered bullet or not locks the trigger.\n \nIt has last 4 serial digits stamped on a lot of parts, such as both mags, firing mechanism (outer slide side), barrel, some digits on the topside of inside frame, and even the barrel opening front has the 4 digits. It is hard chrome barrel in and out. Serial number starts with 311 with 66 at the top right corner of the frame, Norinco logo on left in the middle of the slide, repeat of serial number ahead of rear sights, then 2 Chinese symbols and then M20. Thats about it. The serial numbers seemed to be stamped instead of computerized engraved. I recall that stamped were original. Is all of above pointing to an original?\n\nOne concern though. I found the guide rod to be a lot smaller than Zastava''s and a long and strong spring which made setting the guide rod and spring assembly a bit of a pain. Had to keep it pressed upon slide reinstall until the last moment. Is this normal? Cocking it with hammer up requires some strength.\n\nAs Zastava was a good hand fit and I was near many sports shops, I picked up the better quality cricket bat handle rubber and now I feel comfortable with the grip.

Using the pipsqueak rounds when your life hangs in the balance may seem similar to the &#8220;Charge of the Light Brigade,&#8221; taking the approach that, &#8220;Theirs not to reason why. Theirs but to do and die.&#8221; That kind of thinking is unacceptable.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]The fact is, .22 LR is, will and has been used extensively for self-defense&#8212;probably more often than you think. Rifles and handguns chambered for the rimfire cartridge are affordable, compact and the most common of all firearms. They have been the gun behind the door in American households for more than a century. They&#8217;re easy to shoot, don&#8217;t make a lot of noise and don&#8217;t cost an arm and a leg to feed.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Why are they often used for self-defense? Well, why do you pick your nose with your finger? It&#8217;s convenient at the time.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]A .22 LR is the only gun some people own. That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the most appropriate. I&#8217;ve driven nails with a crescent wrench and smashed my finger, used a knife as a pry bar and cut myself and even tried to move snow with a dirt shovel and been down in the back for a week. We can all agree there&#8217;s almost always a better choice for self-defense. The question is: When, if ever, is the .22 LR a good choice and just how effective is it?\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]&#8220;Since the first rule of gunfighting is to have a gun, any gun is better than none at all. The little .22 LR may actually be better than some larger calibers, depending upon the ammunition selected. For example, I would think a high-velocity .22 cartridge like the Stinger might be a better choice than a .25 ACP loaded with FMJ rounds.&#8221;\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]A Practical Analysis of the Latest Handgun Ammunition, .22 LR Stinger ammunition was 58 percent more effective at producing one-shot stops than any of the FMJ .25 Auto loads.[/FONT][FONT=sans-serif] [/FONT][FONT=Verdana]When selecting a defensive handgun Head&#8217;s wife could carry in her pocket, he choose the little Smith & Wesson J-frame Model 317 in .22 LR. Several things convinced him it was the right choice. For one, similarly sized revolvers in .357 Mag. and even .38 Spl. can be uncomfortable to shoot. Second, Smith & Wesson&#8217;s eight-shot 317 only weighs 11 ounces. Finally, and most important, with the 317 his wife can consistently put all eight rounds into a target the size of an eye socket at 5 yards. Head asks, &#8220;What more do you need?&#8221;\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]&#8220;Nobody wants to get shot with any gun. It&#8217;s been my experience people just don&#8217;t stand there and let you shoot them. The most common stop is psychological. Most people stop fighting quickly after having been shot. Although we tend to worry endlessly about knockdown power and about what bullet and load is best, fact is, people just don&#8217;t like getting shot, and unless facing the rare superhuman, even a .22 can get the job done.&#8221;\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]&#8220;If you are going to use a .22, practice until you can reliably make central nervous system hits.&#8221; It&#8217;s hard to argue with the logic. After all, he does make his living training folks on how to use a firearm to stay alive at what might be the premier firearms fighting school in the world.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Lists of the effectiveness of six different .22 LR loads based on 4,483 actual street shootings. On average, the cartridge produced one-shot stops 31 percent of the time. Based on their sampling criteria, the .22 LR was found to be about half as effective as the .32 ACP. With data from 465 shootings, the second-best .22 LR load with 38 percent one-shot stops. With only 10 shootings, the original .22 LR HP load had the highest rating at 40 percent.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Statistics and predictions are interesting, but I like finding out for myself. While hunting, I&#8217;ve observed the effects of different .22 LR loads on a variety of animals. I&#8217;ve also seen a few humans who have been shot with a .22. Like almost every other cartridge, results varied. So I turned to ordnance gelatin. Using the Beretta Bobcat, a Smith & Wesson M&P15-22, Walther P22, ISSC M22 and a Kimber Crimson Carry with a .22 LR conversion kit, I tested Hollow-Point, but the ammo results came from Remington and my favorite .22 LR hunting load, the Eley Sport.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Remington ammo penetrated the deepest, but did not expand out of the Bobcat. Remington ammunition penetrated to a moderate depth and showed expansion regardless of barrel length. The real surprises were the two bullets Remington & Eley Sport are a very good results . Depending on the load, these bullets break into three pieces weighing between 10 and 14 grains each. Regardless of velocity, they always penetrated to almost 6 inches. About an inch or so into the gelatin, these bullets break apart, fan out and continue to drive on. They diverge from the centerline of the bullet&#8217;s path between 2 and 4 inches.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]One-shot terminal performance tests are interesting, but what if you shoot a bad guy multiple times? Based their findings on one shot, but I&#8217;m not sure one shot is the best way to evaluate the .22 LR cartridge for self-defense. Why? Because it&#8217;s so easy to shoot fast and accurately. With the help of some friends I tested this hypothesis using a SIG Sauer P229 in .40 S&W and with a SIG .22 LR conversion kit. We found we could get twice as many hits in the same amount of time with the .22 LR. There were also fewer misses with the rimfire.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Make what you will of this data. What cannot be ignored examined almost 4,500 instances where a .22 LR was used for self-defense. In the same study they tracked the effectiveness of 16 different .45 ACP loads for a total of only 1,728 shootings. Yes, the .45 ACP was more effective, but what&#8217;s astonishing was that they had twice the number of shootings to evaluate with the .22 LR. This should dispel any doubts the .22 LR is frequently used in an attempt to stop bad guys.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]So, what about stopping power? This term always comes up. For what it&#8217;s worth, consider that the first homicide I ever investigated, the perpetrator used a pellet rifle. Also, during my 13 years as a police officer, I pointed my handgun at a lot of bad guys doing a lot of bad things. In only two instances did it fail to make them stop. That&#8217;s potent stopping power, and the trigger was never pulled. I would add that none first asked me, &#8220;Hey, how big a gun you got?&#8221; Like Head said, nobody wants to get shot with anything. It&#8217;s a matter of perception and perception is important.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]The public&#8217;s opinions on the .22 LR for self-defense is also interesting. With the help of my friend. In four days he received 1,422 responses. It appears the average gun person is pretty sensible when it comes to personal protection. Most agreed a .22 LR was a better choice than a .25 ACP and that having a gun and being able to hit accurately and fast were primary considerations. A .22 LR handgun is about the easiest to get, carry and hit with. If it works!\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Anyone considering the .22 LR for protection must realize duds are a reality with rimfire ammunition, mainly with the cheap stuff. However, I once fired a brick of Remington during a prairie dog shoot without a single hiccup on ISSC M22. That said, CCI are not your typical .22 LR ammo; the case is longer and pressures are high. The same goes for the Stinger. In some guns, these just flat will not work.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Another fact is handguns are not the only solution to personal protection and bad guys are not the only thing we need protection from. My wife called to tell me my son had been chased into the house by a rabid fox. My mother-in-law was at home with the kids and they were all, according to my three-year old, &#8220;Freaked up!&#8221; I told them to call the State Police. A Trooper friend arrived and smacked the fox with a .45 ACP. It took two hollow points to stop the fox.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]In my closet you&#8217;ll now find a Walther P22 or ISSC M22 with a magazine full of Remington, with a weaponlight and a laser on the quad rail. My mother-in-law and my 10-year-old son can shoot the accurately and they know what to do if accosted by another rabid anything. If something goes bump in the night, it might be the gun I grab. It&#8217;s terrifying how swiftly and accurately I can shoot this carbine.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]Twenty-two in the closet or not, I generally carry a .2LR Walther P22 or sometimes ISSC M22. In my office there&#8217;s a loaded, 16-inch-barreled lever gun chambered for the .327. A .22 LR is a key part of my self-defense. Lots of  people come up to me & tell me to use 9mm for self defence. I never use a caliber like 9mm for self defence. Now i''m not stating that 9mm is a bad caliber. There many other caliber out there which are better than 9mm. \n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]The .22 LR cartridge is truly a member of the Light Brigade when it comes to self-defense. It may be easy to shoot accurately and fast and it might be the cartridge most frequently used for that purpose. It may even work better than you think. For those who don&#8217;t have another choice, don&#8217;t have the money to procure another option or the physical ability to use anything else, the old cliché seems to fit. It&#8217;s better than nothing.\n[/FONT]\n[FONT=Verdana]If by intention or misfortune you end up relying on the .22 LR for protection, here are some good rules to follow: Use reliable ammo, shoot straight and don&#8217;t stop shooting until the threat no longer exists. That&#8217;s actually exceedingly good advice no matter what cartridge you choose. I personally choose ISSC M22 with Remington Yellow Jacket anytime anywhere.[/FONT]\n[/COLOR][/quote]', ''),

Many US owners report low quality with Norinco because all they have available are old stock (pre ban). We Canadians who kept getting Norino products have seen their steady rise in quality with each passing year. I have spoken with an M14 enthusiast who assured me there is no difference, performancewise, between the new Norinco''s and the Springfields (they are still making M14''s as well).

Everything hurts from .22 to 500 S&W magnum nobody wants to get shot but in some cases which also depends on individual''s nerve if your shot is not well placed the BG can shoot back even after taking a 45 ACP dose it all depends on individual nerves and situation so better to choose a decent stopper like 9mm 40s&w or 45 acp, with the first two practice double tap alot, easy draw and no hesitation in pulling the trigger once your gun is drawn.', ''),

There is supposed to be a range report in every review, isn’t it ? but there is more.\n\nBefore the wasted range report, I want to tell you that the trigger of the new 452/455’s is a killer.\n\nRidiculously heavy (about +5lb''s) & a lot of creep (about +20/1000”) as compared to old BRNO’s,\n\nIt was very hard to keep hold on the target when pulling such a hard & clumsy trigger.\n\nI was just shooting flyers for the sake of range report.\n\nFor me, it was like .22 Left-Right, rather than .22 Long-Rifle.\n\nAnd the Scope was also making things worse with its 4x fixed magnification & R2 reticle.\n\nIt was so stressful for me to keep a steady hold beyond 50 meters.\n\nSituation was despairing & my feeling of “Something Missing” was growing strong.\n\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/AjInMjP_zpsa41562e3.gif.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/AjInMjP_zpsa41562e3.gif[/IMG][/URL]\n\nAnd I was just like, what the heck should I do now!\n\n[I]"Mareez-e-ishq par rehmat Khuda ki, Marz barhta gaya joon joon dawa ki..."[/I]\n\nSo I decided to take the desperate measures, and a coded distress signal was on the roam,\nA quick reply came expectedly from the *Holy Gunsmith* & it came back with all the remedies.\n\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just Guns/IMG_1133_zpsdaf955f5.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Just Guns/IMG_1133_zpsdaf955f5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nRoyal Mail arrived with a couple of trigger kits & a 10rd magazine.\n\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just Guns/IMG_1130_zps1d4ef015.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Just Guns/IMG_1130_zps1d4ef015.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nThis kit removes the creep and lightens the trigger pull weight by the use of shims and new springs. Kit includes 4 shimming tubes of different thicknesses and 4 new springs of different strength, plus a 3/32 roll pin to replace the original front trigger pin. Trigger pull weight can be adjusted from approx. 0.5 to 3.5 pounds. The kit also provides you with a new pin to use instead of the old one. The replacement isn''t actually a pin, but a rolled piece of metal.\n\nSince I don''t have a trigger pull gauge to measure the ones in between, I guess the second lightest spring is around 1.5 pounds & that''s a complete guess but all these springs are noticeably lighter than the stock spring, which I know weighs more than +5 pounds for sure. \n\nIndividual results may vary.', ''),

(Don’t ask about the rest). ;)\n\nInstallation is very simple and pretty straight forward, if you know what & how to do.\n\n[I]“If it is Important to you, you will find a way. If not, you will find an excuse.” ;)[/I]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000]First of all, \n[B]ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE YOUR FIREARM IS UNLOADED[/B]. \nCheck again.[/COLOR] \n\nRemove the action from the stock, but leave the bolt in the receiver un-cocked.\nIt’s a simple task of tapping out the pins. \nUse the punch to drift the trigger pins holding the trigger group to the receiver.\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just Guns/IMG_1121b_zps51dd5d4a.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Just Guns/IMG_1121b_zps51dd5d4a.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nFirst you need to remove the rear pin, which holds the rear of the trigger and spring rod in place. \nOnce the pin is removed the trigger swings down as well as the spring assembly. \nDon''t lose the washer above the trigger adjustment nut either. \nThat spring is what determines the trigger pull weight. \nYou can replace the factory spring with a lighter one now, and that’s all you need to do if you only want to change the spring. \nJust put the pin back and you are done.\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just Guns/IMG_1120_zps06a5b023.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Just Guns/IMG_1120_zps06a5b023.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nThe gap where second pin fits is where the creep comes from. \nWhen you pull the trigger the tiny space that the pin has to travel before actually making contact with the sear is creep. \nYou can think of it as a dead zone before things actually go click.\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just Guns/IMG_1203a_zps34775c2c.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Just Guns/IMG_1203a_zps34775c2c.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nNow remove the second pin and the trigger comes completely free. \nDo not remove the front pin completely. \nI allow it to stay attached to the right side of the trigger bracket. \nIf you are going to replace the front pin with the provided roll pin, remove the front pin completely. \n\nOnce you have the trigger out it''s just a matter of trying out the different shims to see what fills the gap between the sear best. \nThis is a trial and error thing, and takes a little time to figure out depending on your firearm and spring / shim combo.\n \nYou basically need to keep putting back / taking off the trigger to see what works. \nYou can''t really tell by just half putting it back on and eye balling it (I learned that the fool''s way). \nYou really put everything in to see if it actually fits alright.\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just Guns/IMG_1240a_zps3f394bdd.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Just

noticeable that I honestly don''t even know if I chose the right one. \nI recommend starting with one of the thinner tubes first.\n\nIt turns out that the red one fits mine or at least that''s what I thought at the time, it''s 16/1000" inch thick. \nBut trigger was not engaging with the sear at all, so I had to do it all over again and I ended up with the blue one, which was the thinnest at 10/1000”.\n\nTo lighten the trigger I used the second lightest spring in the kit. \nAs the lightest one felt borderline dangerous and would probably just fire if the stock was hit. \n\nRemember my intent is a bench queen, not a critter getter or I would choose a heavier spring for safety for a hunting application.\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just

the gap between the sear (above the front trigger pin area). \nThe tube placed around the front pin acts as a shim between the front pin and the receiver that pulls the trigger slightly backwards & does not allow the trigger to move forward as far as it did before. \nThis reduces the engagement with the sear, which reduces creep.\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just Guns/IMG_1222_zpsb8a20f1a.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Just Guns/IMG_1222_zpsb8a20f1a.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nYou are ready to reassemble the trigger now. \nThe front pin will go back through the tube when you replace the trigger. \n\nTo reassemble, seat the spring and spring bar in the recess in the receiver, start installing the rear trigger pin. \nTo make sure the pins line up with the opposite holes, align the shim between the ears of the trigger yolk for the installation of the front trigger pin. \nTap in both pins, always checking the alignments of the pins, holes in the trigger yoke, holes in the receiver and the alignment of the shim along the way. \nHitting harder won''t do any good if the pin isn''t started in the hole.\n\n[URL="http://s1052.photobucket.com/user/miananjum/media/Just Guns/IMG_1118_zps37397ba9.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1052.photobucket.com/albums/s459/miananjum/Just Guns/IMG_1118_zps37397ba9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nPut everything back together and you''re done.\n\n"[I]If at first you don''t succeed, then maybe you should do it the way I told you the first time[/I]." ;)\n\nNow I have a very light trigger with very little creep.\n Pretty much a light touch will fire it now.\nYou can guess if you ever have fired a CZ Tactical Sport. \n\nJust be sure that you end up with a safe trigger! \n\nI prefer to do the bump test before you reassemble the rifle. \nCycle the bolt repeatedly, and then use a rubber mallet to hit the rear of the receiver behind the bolt, if the sear does not release, you should be good to go. \n\nTo be sure your trigger is safe and that the final trigger has at least 12/1000” of sear engagement.\nAnd mine was definitely having less than that and I will not consider it safe, especially for hunting.\n\nI believe that we have a responsibility to err on the side of safety when modifying a gun.', ''),

(551124, ' By switching mags and "giving them a rest" every other week, you are wearing them out even more than just keeping them fully loaded! A brand new spring is supposed to "go soft" a little bit before it gets to it''s natural rebound tension. Whether in its contracted or expanded position, a spring doesn''t wear if it doesn''t move. Think of a piece of plastic, if you fold it over and hold it, it won''t break... fold it back and hold it, still doesn''t break... but continue folding back and forth and it will snap. Same with springs, it is the movement! \n\nSo let''s do the math... Let''s say a recoil spring needs changing at 7500 rounds. That''s seven thousand five hundred compressions and expansions. Now let''s keep the same replacement schedule for the mag spring, and say you load your mags to 10 rounds. So you have to load and fire ten shots for one compression cycle. That means it will take a firing of 75,000 rounds before replacing! If you practice 100 rounds each month, 1200 per year, it will take over 60 years. If you load them to 17, and consistently shoot 100 rounds every month of every year, I think it will be safe to say your magazine spring will outlast you :)\n\nHere''s some more misinformation...\n[QUOTE=cancer_doc;388205]I think here revolver wins with a big margin. Take Taurus 608 and put 7 in wheel sparing the one which will come under hammer.\n\nAnd then forget about spring getting soft and magazine malfunction etc. You can keep it in this way for years and years...[/QUOTE]\nTrue, a revolver completely eliminates spring issues altogether, but the practice of not keeping a round under the hammer was a necessity of the 1800''s! Thats how the cowboys carried their Colt Single Action Armies, at least the smart ones did. Because once they dropped their gun and if it landed on the hammer (which happens often when you constantly ride, and climb on and off horses), there was nothing between the firing pin and the primer to prevent it from setting off the round. Now, I don''t know exactly when they became standard equipment, but all of my father''s S&W revolvers from the 1950''s have hammer blocks. I am no Taurus expert, I don''t even own one but I would bet good money that their revolvers will all have a hammer block/transfer bar, which prevents discharge from dropping and making it completely safe to load its cylinder to full capacity.', ''),

There are only two persons who can do this in Pakistan, Aseel Khan & Sardar Naseer, Both have waiting time for more than a year & cost is north of your total budget that is 150K.\nI don&#8217;t think your Ordinary Gunsmith can handle the head spacing & other issues neither he is equipped so. I would really want to know the expertise of the guy who has assembled the rig as firing a powerful cartridge at 600 yards is no joke. I am not at all intended to discourage you but being on the same boat for last two years & have seen many disappointments in this time. \nYour logic of Self Defense is also very vague, How come you can judge the intentions of a person or bunch of persons at 600 yards until you have Airborne Warning and Control System for support. Good luck in proving your SD situation to LEA & courts. Engaging any body at such a distance will not be in the league of self defense situations[/QUOTE]\n\nRe Warning systems, the tube wells, warehouses and farm house will have laser and motion detector alarms installed with siren warnings and flood lights to go off during breach. If the robbers are armed, then they will be warned verbally first and then with warning shots if they are armed before engaging fully if they fire first. The security system with include night vision CCTV system as well for LEA and courts. This security policy has been consulted with intelligence and judges. Karachi Grammar School has sniper on roof top to protect the school, as an example. Nestle and Unilever plants are heavily armed with security technologies.  Protecting one''s property within the boundaries is everyone''s legal right.\n \nIf rig is a major issue here then the original & bare rifle stock will be shipped from USA and assembled here. Scope will be either 2.5-24x42 or 4.5-30×50 Bushnell 6500 Elite Mil-Dots. Those scopes are strong enough for the $600 26" barrel .308 Rem 700 to be accurate to 600 yards. If it becomes too difficult then only I will spend 300k+ buying from an importer.', ''),

There are so many devices that claim to "zero without wasting ammo". I''ve seen them all... ones you stick on, clamp on, mount on rail, in the barrel, in the chamber, on the scope, using lasers, graphics, graphs, charts... at the end of the day, the only tried and true method is the old fashioned way. That is, with lots of ammo and lots of targets :)\nSome of them seem like great ideas but if you read the fine print, most of those gimmicks usually admit they will only "get you on paper". Even the caliber specific ones are just barely good enough to do that. To be honest, whether you''re trying to zero a laser, a scope, or sights, you shouldnt need a gadget to hit somewhere on a 2''x2'' target at 50m. If you can''t, nine times out of ten, the mounting has been done improperly. Otherwise, it''s probably a defect with the optic.', ''),

The average scope contains over 50 parts and lenses (thats about twice the number pieces in a gun like TT or Glock), and they have to be assembled very precisely in particular order. Furthermore, the tube is filled with nitrogen gas (doesnt hold moisture), so when you open them up, they have to be flushed and refilled. Obviously that takes some special skills and equipment.

Even if these three problems are the main culprit,  how much would it cost to repair it ? i bought the weapon for 12k last year will post the pics of the internals. the trigger mech is that of a typical ak47 with the same double hook trigger, disconnector and hammer the bolt is different and the manner in which the recoil spring is attached to the bolt makes it impossible to remove the bolt from the lower receiver while field strippping please help out here if the guy who just bought his NIB mp5knows how to completely dissassemble his mp5 then dolet me know depending on the possibilty that yours and mine are somewhat identical', ''),
(551310, ' another thing that i noticed about the weapon is that, if the hammer is already reset (hammer being caught by the double hook trigger) and i retract the bolt back, the bolt pushes down on the hammer further (while being fully retracted to the rear) which in turn causes the hammer to get caught by the dis-connector. note : i havent touched the trigger at all in this whole scenario and the trigger is in its most forward position or you can say that its on safe. is this some sort of a built in design feature of operation or the guy who made the weapon didnt know what he was doing ??? so in order to undo this what he did was that he installed some sort of a sear at the end  of the hammer and also made a trip for it on the bolt in shape of a curve so that when i let go of the bolt, the curvish part hits the sear thingy and which inturn pushes the hammer upwards  and voila its gets caught by the double hooks of the trigger.I DOnt reckon if youre still  on the same page as me, but to me it just seems as a stupid mechanism and i wanted to know if yours does the same thing aswell. now i dont know much about firearms but i guess that if someone wanted to break the law and make this a full auto weapon then they would just simply replace that thing at the end of the hammer and install a proper auto sear. your guesses are as good as mine i would love to get a reply form the experts', ''),

After which your picture will be taken. Your license copy will arrive after a month and half or so. The process will take some time but you will get a license.', ''),

(551485, 'new rifle - Remington Model 8 A few weeks ago, I discovered a rifle I''d never heard of - the Remington Model 8.  It was designed by John Moses Browning, same guy who designed various other rifles and pistols.  FN made the original design in 1900, Remington picked it up in 1906, but few were made (apparently they were expensive) and production stopped before WWII.\r\n\r\n I''ve been a gun geek all my life, and I''d never heard of such a thing.  Not one of my (many) books or magazines has a word on it, and I''d never come across a mention online, at least until I sought information on them.  So, by my standards, it''s a pretty rare piece of hardware...\r\n\r\n I made the mistake of looking on Gunbroker, and there one was.  For some reason the prices on the Model 8s are 1/2 to 1/3 of rifles of similar age.  I don''t know why.  On impulse, I made the minimum bid.  A week later, nobody else had bid, and it was mine.  I had to have it shipped from California to a Federally licensed dealer, and pick it up from him; that''s how it works here.  And now it''s here.\r\n\r\n It''s a semiautomatic in .30 Remington, basically a rimless .30-30 Winchester.  The gun works on the "long recoil" system, like some machine guns and shotguns.  The thick barrel is actually a sheet metal sleeve, a long spring, and the barrel inside.  The barrel reciprocates some distance inside the sleeve to operate the action; I haven''t taken the rifle apart yet, but I think it''s around 70mm.  Five round fixed magazine, though there were conversions to detachable magazines, including a long 20 round "police" magazine.\r\n\r\n To me, it looks like a lever action, except with no lever.  It''s a little bitty carbine; larger than a child''s rifle, but still very small.  Ammunition is obsolete and unobtainable; I''ve located some loading dies, but brass hasn''t been made in a while, and though Remington says they''ll make more eventually, there''s no indication of when.

My wife is nuts about bags; she''s looking for something like it.  \n\n Oh, and you can load it with stripper clips, just like a military rifle.  That is a Model 81 in the picture, which had a "pistol grip" stock and an American-style forend instead of the 8''s Germanic Schnabel shape.  Only the wood is different between the 8 and 81.\n\n Calibers were .25 Remington, .30 Remington, and .35 Remington.  This was the rifle the .35 Remington was designed for, and it''s still around today.  It even has reasonable popularity in Europe, and Izhmash used to list it as available in civilian-market AK-47 rifles.  The .25 went away in the 1920s when the Model 81 came out, and the .30, while never popular, hung on until after the war, mostly in Remington''s odd pump-action rifles.  This is ".30 Remington", not ".30 Remington AR", which complicates searching the web for ammunition and components.', ''),

(551673, 'ALLAH Almighty Saved Me I''m 22 years old and it''s been less then a year i am using handguns. My 1st handgun was a CF-98. Had fired only few rounds with my CF-98 and it was a perfect gun. I sold it because i only use handguns occasionally so i bought a Diamond 30 bore which is a Pakistani made weapon. I had fired 14 rounds with my 30 bore last week and that day i noticed it fired 2 rounds together. As if it''s a fully automatic pistol. I was quite confused that what had happened. I thought maybe i pulled the trigger quickly twice and 2 bullets fired together. There were 5 bullets in the mag. 3 fired normally and 2 of them went together as if my pistol is a automatic weapon. Khair that day i was quite confused that what had happened. Today few hours ago i was sitting on my PC and took out my gun and started cleaning it. I like cleaning it atleast once a week. I didn''t open it. Just cleaned it from above using a microfiber cloths. After cleaning it i loaded it and chambered a round to check if it chambers properly. It did chamber properly and i took out the mag and pulled the slide and the bullet got out. Then again loaded it chambered a round and BANG! Sitting on the sofa infront of PC totally shocked. A loud bang with fire and smoke all around the bullet went and the wall few inches from my wall mounted LCD. I was in a shock that what had happened. Few feets away my dad was standing near the wall where the bullet hit. We both were in a real shock and were checking each other if we got hit. 5 inch deep hole in my bedroom''s hard concrete wall. My dad snatched the pistol from me and said nothing because we both were in deep shock. We were wondering what if the bullet rebounded and hit any of us. It was not my fault because when i chambered my finger was far far away from the trigger. What more frightening is i used to chamber this pistol and aim it on my head to scare the sh*t out of cousins. I now wonder what if that time hammer went down byitself like today. I would had been history. In future if i buy a imported weapon i am not going to aim it at anyone unless and until i wish to fire. Allah ne bachaya. Allah ki taraf se ik lesson tha.', ''),

I myself use a Taurus pt 92 clone. There are lots of accessories like extra mags. full wrap around grips. laser/light option. extremely reliable due to open slide design. \n\n[URL]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=138&category=Pistol&toggle=&breadcrumbseries=[/URL]\n\nIt has a key lock system. A frame mounted safety for added comfort. The safety lever has 3 positions. And unlike the berreta it has the ability of being carreid cocked and locked. \n\nThe lever can both decock and act as manual safety. \n\nThe downside the open slide design means that the barrel can get extremely hot after sustained shooting. While it does not effect the weapon in any way it will mean u have to be careful while handling the gun. \n\nIt is a big gun to conceal. I do conceal carry it at times but its a large weapon. \nit has been made on berreta mechinery. \n\nThe slightly compact version is called the 917c\n\nThen there is the 809 series. 3 grips for different hand sizes. magazine loader.\n\n[URL]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=602&category=Pistol&toggle=&breadcrumbseries=[/URL]\n\nTherei s a compact version of the same weapon available. \n\nThere is the G II 24/7 Taurus.\n[URL]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=739&category=Pistol&toggle=&breadcrumbseries=[/URL]\n\nSame as 809 but striker fired.\n\nALL of these weapons are 80k r so. \n\nShould u not like the Taurus range then there is the Turkish offerings\n\nThe Stoeger Cougar is 72k or so. And is basicaly a berreta  with Italian magazines. The stoeger has been aquired by berreta. So u are essentialy getting a Turkish berreta.\n\nVery reliable rotary berrel. 15 shot. \n\n[URL]http://www.stoegerindustries.com/firearms/stoeger-cougar.php[/URL]\n\nIt has a decocker/manual safety but cannot be carred cocked and locked. It also does not have the loaded chamber indicator that the taurus line does. \n\nAnd the new ones are without rails unfortunately :( \n\nThen there are teh Canik series of weapons. the TP 9 which u know about 70k  the C 100 64k\n\nCanik Shark 70k\n\nAll of them have either decockers ''or'' manual safeties not both.\n\nU can get a slightly used CZ 75 as well at this range. But again Either decocker or manual safety unlike the taurus and eth cougar in which U get both.\n\nThen of course there is hte Russian baikal 446 Viking. A veritable tank of a gun. With duel feed ramps its extremely reliable with all kinds of ammo.\n\nBut again very big and bulky. Since its designed as a side arm of the Russian Army. \n\nIt has a manual safety and can be carried cocked and locked. However it does not have a decocker and decoking it is not an easy job at all.[/QUOTE]', ''),

(551854, ' [QUOTE=gouloulmama;389644]I''m 22 years old and it''s been less then a year i am using handguns. My 1st handgun was a CF-98. Had fired only few rounds with my CF-98 and it was a perfect gun. I sold it because i only use handguns occasionally so i bought a Diamond 30 bore which is a Pakistani made weapon. I had fired 14 rounds with my 30 bore last week and that day i noticed it fired 2 rounds together. As if it''s a fully automatic pistol. I was quite confused that what had happened. I thought maybe i pulled the trigger quickly twice and 2 bullets fired together. There were 5 bullets in the mag. 3 fired normally and 2 of them went together as if my pistol is a automatic weapon. Khair that day i was quite confused that what had happened. Today few hours ago i was sitting on my PC and took out my gun and started cleaning it. I like cleaning it atleast once a week. I didn''t open it. Just cleaned it from above using a microfiber cloths. After cleaning it i loaded it and chambered a round to check if it chambers properly. It did chamber properly and i took out the mag and pulled the slide and the bullet got out. Then again loaded it chambered a round and BANG! Sitting on the sofa infront of PC totally shocked. A loud bang with fire and smoke all around the bullet went and the wall few inches from my wall mounted LCD. I was in a shock that what had happened. Few feets away my dad was standing near the wall where the bullet hit. We both were in a real shock and were checking each other if we got hit. 5 inch deep hole in my bedroom''s hard concrete wall. My dad snatched the pistol from me and said nothing because we both were in deep shock. We were wondering what if the bullet rebounded and hit any of us. It was not my fault because when i chambered my finger was far far away from the trigger. What more frightening is i used to chamber this pistol and aim it on my head to scare the sh*t out of cousins. I now wonder what if that time hammer went down byitself like today. I would had been history. In future if i buy a imported weapon i am not going to aim it at anyone unless and until i wish to fire. Allah ne bachaya.

Okay let me elaborate...\n\n1. Let''s not go in details of DIY licenses, and as you have mentioned you get a license from a contact in DC east. He hands you over a Manual license book. This step includes challan of 4500/= paid to govt. You don''t need to do that.\n\nPlease note that on very first page of the book there is suppose to be a RED ROUND national bank stamp and registry number but you will NOT find it most of the times so you need to do that part on your own.\n\n2. Purchase a weapon from market, any reputed and trustworthy dealer you may know about. Dealer will make his entry on your book.\n\n3. You need to take the book back to DC office for weapon entry, it should take an hour but he will actually ask you to leave the book there and call back tomorrow for an status update.\n\n4. Once you are done with weapon entry at DC office, you should take it to NBP main branch (II Chandigarh road one). They are suppose to do the registry of license without any charges. They will stamp it and enter registration number on main page of license.\n\n5. Get your weapon and license registered in local PS. This is important because if you encounter an educated LEA (who can actually read), he will INDEED look for PS entry!\n\n6. Find a reputed dealer who can help you computerize your license. Currently market rates are 5k to 7k. If you are interested in computerization, (a) no need to do #4 first because you will need to do it again after once its computerized. (b) You need to have a weapon on your license, otherwise your application will be rejected in HD.\n\nFor #6 and #2 I recommend Zubair at Decent Arms, Lucky Star, Karachi.', ''),

You see bro you can never be too careful with guns.[/QUOTE]\n+1,000,000\nGoul, I dont even have words for that story. Now pardon me if im being rude but, boy seriously, are you for real? Or are you just making things up to get people''s attention? I''m asking because I really don''t believe anyone can be that stupid. \n\nI mean first off, you clearly knew that there was something wrong and the gun was spontaneously discharging. Yet you still decide to play with it at home, with family around, and in a hot condition?\nSecondly, you said you "didn''t open it", just wiped it clean. Yet you still have to "check if it chambers properly"?\nThirdly, why would anyone in their right mind point a gun at themselves or others for fun? \nFourthly, why would anyone with any mind do so with a chambered round and hammer cocked?!? \nFifthly, you think "It was not my fault because when i chambered my finger was far far away from the trigger" \n\nIf thats what you think, then this will probably come as a shock, but... IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT! That''s the painful truth. Be thankful it wasn''t more painful. If you''re old enough to have your own gun, then you''re old enough to be fully responsible for it, and where it''s bullets go. \n\nThere is no need to cycle live ammo (or any ammo at all) to do a function test. All you have to do is check proper function of safety, trigger reset, and hammer follow. If you want to check firing function, let me give you a tip that may save your life... cock your gun, drop a plastic pen down your barrel, point at ceiling, and pull trigger. If the pen flies out, your gun is working! I don''t know who taught you how to handle firearms, but I will teach you this... If you don''t know how to treat any gun as if it''s loaded, and not to point any gun at anything you''re not willing to shoot, then you have no business being around firearms.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

Now pardon me if im being rude but, boy seriously, are you for real? Or are you just making things up to get people''s attention? I''m asking because I really don''t believe anyone can be that stupid. \n\nI mean first off, you clearly knew that there was something wrong and the gun was spontaneously discharging. Yet you still decide to play with it at home, with family around, and in a hot condition?\nSecondly, you said you "didn''t open it", just wiped it clean. Yet you still have to "check if it chambers properly"?\nThirdly, why would anyone in their right mind point a gun at themselves or others for fun? \nFourthly, why would anyone with any mind do so with a chambered round and hammer cocked?!? \nFifthly, you think "It was not my fault because when i chambered my finger was far far away from the trigger" \n\nIf thats what you think, then this will probably come as a shock, but... IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT! That''s the painful truth. Be thankful it wasn''t more painful. If you''re old enough to have your own gun, then you''re old enough to be fully responsible for it, and where it''s bullets go. \n\nThere is no need to cycle live ammo (or any ammo at all) to do a function test. All you have to do is check proper function of safety, trigger reset, and hammer follow. If you want to check firing function, let me give you a tip that may save your life... cock your gun, drop a plastic pen down your barrel, point at ceiling, and pull trigger. If the pen flies out, your gun is working! I don''t know who taught you how to handle firearms, but I will teach you this... If you don''t know how to treat any gun as if it''s loaded, and not to point any gun at anything you''re not willing to shoot, then you have no business being around firearms.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nDude that gun was firing properly i wanted to check if it chambers properly. Secondly as soon as i chambered the gun fired byitself. The hammer dropped byitself. How is this my fault. U seem to be from US. The gun i had was a local made weapon which is available brand new for 8000. You are not aware of darra weapon my friend. Don''t google darra it''s not a company.

Then came revolving pistols.  Samuel Colt, who should surely know, called his invention a "revolving pistol", or just a "pistol", as did most manufacturers.  Later came autoloading, or "automatic" pistols.\r\n\r\n If it doesn''t have a stock and you''re supposed to shoot it one-handed, it''s a pistol, no matter how the magazine is arranged.\r\n\r\n The term "handgun" came about much later.  I guess to differentiate them from footguns.

A frame mounted safety for added comfort. The safety lever has 3 positions. And unlike the berreta it has the ability of being carreid cocked and locked. \n\nThe lever can both decock and act as manual safety. \n\nThe downside the open slide design means that the barrel can get extremely hot after sustained shooting. While it does not effect the weapon in any way it will mean u have to be careful while handling the gun. \n\nIt is a big gun to conceal. I do conceal carry it at times but its a large weapon. \nit has been made on berreta mechinery. \n\nThe slightly compact version is called the 917c\n\nThen there is the 809 series. 3 grips for different hand sizes. magazine loader.\n\n[URL]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=602&category=Pistol&toggle=&breadcrumbseries=[/URL]\n\nTherei s a compact version of the same weapon available. \n\nThere is the G II 24/7 Taurus.\n[URL]http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=739&category=Pistol&toggle=&breadcrumbseries=[/URL]\n\nSame as 809 but striker fired.\n\nALL of these weapons are 80k r so. \n\nShould u not like the Taurus range then there is the Turkish offerings\n\nThe Stoeger Cougar is 72k or so. And is basicaly a berreta  with Italian magazines. The stoeger has been aquired by berreta. So u are essentialy getting a Turkish berreta.\n\nVery reliable rotary berrel. 15 shot. \n\n[URL]http://www.stoegerindustries.com/firearms/stoeger-cougar.php[/URL]\n\nIt has a decocker/manual safety but cannot be carred cocked and locked. It also does not have the loaded chamber indicator that the taurus line does. \n\nAnd the new ones are without rails unfortunately :( \n\nThen there are teh Canik series of weapons. the TP 9 which u know about 70k  the C 100 64k\n\nCanik Shark 70k\n\nAll of them have either decockers ''or'' manual safeties not both.\n\nU can get a slightly used CZ 75 as well at this range. But again Either decocker or manual safety unlike the taurus and eth cougar in which U get both.\n\nThen of course there is hte Russian baikal 446 Viking. A veritable tank of a gun. With duel feed ramps its extremely reliable with all kinds of ammo.\n\nBut again very big and bulky. Since its designed as a side arm of the Russian Army. \n\nIt has a manual safety and can be carried cocked and locked.

(552232, ' A semi-automatic, or self-loading, firearm is a weapon that performs all steps necessary to prepare the weapon to fire again after firing—assuming cartridges remain in the weapon''s feed device or magazine. Typically, this includes extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from the weapon''s firing chamber, re-cocking the firing mechanism, and loading a new cartridge into the firing chamber. \n\nAlthough automatic weapons and selective fire firearms do the same tasks, semi-automatic firearms do not automatically fire an additional round until the trigger is released and re-pressed by the person firing the weapon.\n\n\nWhile all basic firearm actions require the action to be cycled manually before the first shot, semi-automatic as well as automatic and selective fire actions are differentiated from other forms such as single-action or double-action revolvers, pump-action, bolt-action, or lever-action firearms by eliminating the need to manually cycle the weapon after each shot. For example, to fire ten rounds from a semi-automatic firearm or a selective fire weapon set to fire semi-automatically, the action would initially be cycled to load the first round and the trigger would need to be pulled ten times (once for each round fired). For the other forms, the weapon''s mechanism would require cycling manually prior to firing the next round. An automatic or a selective fire weapon set to fire automatically would be able to fire continuously as long as the trigger is held until the magazine or feed device runs out of ammunition.\n\nSource: [URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_firearm[/URL]', ''),

(552262, ' [QUOTE=tatur1;389869]not really... that means you have got the # 1 only. Okay let me elaborate...\n\n1. Let''s not go in details of DIY licenses, and as you have mentioned you get a license from a contact in DC east. He hands you over a Manual license book. This step includes challan of 4500/= paid to govt. You don''t need to do that.\n\nPlease note that on very first page of the book there is suppose to be a RED ROUND national bank stamp and registry number but you will NOT find it most of the times so you need to do that part on your own.\n\n2. Purchase a weapon from market, any reputed and trustworthy dealer you may know about. Dealer will make his entry on your book.\n\n3. You need to take the book back to DC office for weapon entry, it should take an hour but he will actually ask you to leave the book there and call back tomorrow for an status update.\n\n4. Once you are done with weapon entry at DC office, you should take it to NBP main branch (II Chandigarh road one). They are suppose to do the registry of license without any charges. They will stamp it and enter registration number on main page of license.\n\n5. Get your weapon and license registered in local PS. This is important because if you encounter an educated LEA (who can actually read), he will INDEED look for PS entry!\n\n6. Find a reputed dealer who can help you computerize your license. Currently market rates are 5k to 7k. If you are interested in computerization, (a) no need to do #4 first because you will need to do it again after once its computerized. (b) You need to have a weapon on your license, otherwise your application will be rejected in HD.\n\nFor #6 and #2 I recommend Zubair at Decent Arms, Lucky Star, Karachi.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanks for detailed information, now things are making more sense, I had the bank challan and national bank entry mixed up, thought it was one :( \n\nThanks ED bro for further clarification, will save these steps so aint gotta ask u guys again and again', ''),

Most fights are over in a few seconds.[/QUOTE]\n\nSlash of knife on arm/leg of BG and step back ... first the sharp blade knife cut (that could easily be a 1cm or more) would shock the BG and then the morphine starts to kick in. Gang fights is a different thing but 1-1 this is better. One can kill with just 1 strike by hand but I''d rather step back and let morphine do its work - about 30 seconds ive been told on a coated knife, injection is a lot less. Also a knife out creates a distance in a fight. If many unarmed guys, gun out and shoot the knee cap of one BG for immediate immobilisation and stun the others or watch them run.\n\nThis is PK though, and shooting an unarmed BG (even in the knee) is where police gets a chance to get money off you by arresting you first even if you were not the first one to physically attack.', ''),

(552349, ' Just to give you another point of view, the only Russian guns that are considered desirable here are Ak''s. Baikals are available but not very popular. I don''t even know anyone who has one, so i dont have experience with them. Compared to Norinco, Tauruses cost more and may look nicer, but that doesnt make them perform better. Ive never been a fan of the 92, and besides that, there''s really nothing Taurus makes that is worth having. I hope not to offend anyone, but their 24/7 is famous for being junk, and their revolvers are getting close to Smith & Wesson price, but far from Smith quality. To be fair, their guns are ok for a price point, but that price is half of what they''re being sold for. However even over here, the Cf 98 and NP 22 are renowned for their reliability and value. To get a better gun performancewise, you need to look at Glocks and Sigs, which cost a lot more in both our countries. So regardless of budget, it''s a matter of spending "X" amount and not getting your money''s worth. Or, spending "Y" and getting more than what you paid for. Again, that is my opinion which is a product of the market I am in, your experience may differ.', ''),

(552526, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;390318]Just to give you another point of view, the only Russian guns that are considered desirable here are Ak''s. Baikals are available but not very popular. I don''t even know anyone who has one, so i dont have experience with them. Compared to Norinco, Tauruses cost more and may look nicer, but that doesnt make them perform better. Ive never been a fan of the 92, and besides that, there''s really nothing Taurus makes that is worth having. I hope not to offend anyone, but their 24/7 is famous for being junk, and their revolvers are getting close to Smith & Wesson price, but far from Smith quality. To be fair, their guns are ok for a price point, but that price is half of what they''re being sold for. However even over here, the Cf 98 and NP 22 are renowned for their reliability and value. To get a better gun performancewise, you need to look at Glocks and Sigs, which cost a lot more in both our countries. So regardless of budget, it''s a matter of spending "X" amount and not getting your money''s worth. Or, spending "Y" and getting more than what you paid for. Again, that is my opinion which is a product of the market I am in, your experience may differ.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSir, both of us have same opinions about Taurus guns.\r\n\r\nBaikal handguns are worthy of the price paid, and CZs are also the considerable options.\r\n\r\nAs for Glocks and Sigs, how many of us would like to carry a piece costing over Rs. 300k in a city like Karachi. The actual problem in this city are LEAs, always ready to confiscate a legally licensed weapon from a law abiding citizen. If ever I own a weapon of this range, I will simply keep it in my safe or carry home~range~home.', ''),

I said that legal kaam k paisay nai daetay.... he said Aslah License ka he to paisay hotay han.... :@.....\n\nI was getting in trouble as I dont want to bribe... I said that come to my home and I will serve you chaey pani or Khana... he said ghar ki akarna ha yahin ... I said that no if I give you money now, ya na aap k liyay jaez ho ge laini or na maeray liay daini... so I insisted that no money... he replied that khana to khilana chahihayay na... man na kaha k agar mujhay aap sa koi kaam na ho to then ma aap ko khilaoon to thek ha but agar mujhay aap say koi maam ha to phir nai... (during all this my form was getting verified....by staff of PS.) then he said I am Thaniidaar, dont give me but give to lower staf... I wasnt agree... Then he said that chalaen aap ka ghar visit karnay for Residence proof, I said ok..  but do you need that really... I mean with all these documents, bar letter...  and replied that Chalaen aap ke Thandi garri ma jaen gaey... I said that today I came on bike...anyhow to cut short, an Investigation officer came, or Muharrar I think... (but not sure), Thanidaar whom I was talking and arguing a bit.. said in k sign bhe zaroori han... I said ok... and put form in front of him (which I put in my envelop as it was stamped and verified)...... Thanidaar said that moment, lan G, is ko daekh laen koi ghlati kami na ho....\n\n and that Muharrar or whatever, said that its not the proper prtocedure... you have to go 1st to CPO then they send us this form... proper channel.... I said that I am doing it dasti as that process will take time.... but they were insisting and said that put this verified page of your form here and when you verified it from CPO then  get it from here, I said how can CPO will verify or mark it for you when the form would be incomplete... but then they said that go to DC office take new page of the form.... :@..... I was very upset... and in a bit of anger tear the form 2nd page from the form and hand it to them... and came out of PS................ :@I am very upset, our officials have lowered theselves so much that they even demand bribe for even signing a simple form..... \n\n\nI will now again go to Arms branch on Monday In Sha Allah... and will get new form...!mean while, I want some further help from you brothers....\n\n\nis it right that lawyers can only get one license from quota...??\n\n and does police verification is for all or it is exempted for lawyers...?? if it is exempted then any notification or law???\n\nkindly advise.

Now pardon me if im being rude but, boy seriously, are you for real? Or are you just making things up to get people''s attention? I''m asking because I really don''t believe anyone can be that stupid. \n\nI mean first off, you clearly knew that there was something wrong and the gun was spontaneously discharging. Yet you still decide to play with it at home, with family around, and in a hot condition?\nSecondly, you said you "didn''t open it", just wiped it clean. Yet you still have to "check if it chambers properly"?\nThirdly, why would anyone in their right mind point a gun at themselves or others for fun? \nFourthly, why would anyone with any mind do so with a chambered round and hammer cocked?!? \nFifthly, you think "It was not my fault because when i chambered my finger was far far away from the trigger" \n\nIf thats what you think, then this will probably come as a shock, but... IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT! That''s the painful truth. Be thankful it wasn''t more painful. If you''re old enough to have your own gun, then you''re old enough to be fully responsible for it, and where it''s bullets go. \n\nThere is no need to cycle live ammo (or any ammo at all) to do a function test. All you have to do is check proper function of safety, trigger reset, and hammer follow. If you want to check firing function, let me give you a tip that may save your life... cock your gun, drop a plastic pen down your barrel, point at ceiling, and pull trigger. If the pen flies out, your gun is working! I don''t know who taught you how to handle firearms, but I will teach you this... If you don''t know how to treat any gun as if it''s loaded, and not to point any gun at anything you''re not willing to shoot, then you have no business being around firearms.[/FONT][/SIZE]\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]', ''),

(552631, ' [QUOTE=bird of paradise;390535][SIZE=3]Extraordinary happenings always occur in hunting, this is what i believe about hunting and this is what happened to me. Or may be what happened to me was even more extraordinary than u might imagine. How can i forget that shot, and how stunned everyone was to see what i shot with a single fire. ohhhhh!!! What a remarkable moment that was!!!!!! let me narrate u in brief.\r\n \r\nIt was 25 December 1998, First day of our winter vacation, in our local bela near River Indus, I along with my brother and cousin were standing still. As our Shino just turned his neck towards a small bush and stood still. All of us had guns and were ready for it. All of a sudden a black partridge flew and went straight towards the sky. As i am always too hasty in fire (one of my bad habit in hunting i couldn''t overcome), i turned my Darra made gun just above my head and fired at the bird. What happened was truly remarkable; above the black partridge and straight in its direction was a flight of a dozen mallards. And a male mallard, but it was a very huge one, was also shot and was falling along the black partridge. But the story doesn&#8217;t end here, because what happened afterwards was extraordinarily remarkable. The huge sized mallard which was falling headlong, hit the ground with a thumbing sound. We rushed to it, and then we witnessed the moment and couldn&#8217;t believe our eyes. When i picked up the mallard, a quail was lying just below it. It was also near its death point, the heavy weight of the mallard, which must have been at least 3 kg, had fallen just above the poor quail that it lost its life without being directly hit by any pellet. \r\nAnd thus I bagged one black partridge, one mallard and one quail with a single fire. I used Shaheen No 4. \r\n[/SIZE][/QUOTE]\r\nVery nice.', ''),

(552683, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;389095]By switching mags and "giving them a rest" every other week, you are wearing them out even more than just keeping them fully loaded! A brand new spring is supposed to "go soft" a little bit before it gets to it''s natural rebound tension. Whether in its contracted or expanded position, a spring doesn''t wear if it doesn''t move. Think of a piece of plastic, if you fold it over and hold it, it won''t break... fold it back and hold it, still doesn''t break... but continue folding back and forth and it will snap. Same with springs, it is the movement! \n\nSo let''s do the math... Let''s say a recoil spring needs changing at 7500 rounds. That''s seven thousand five hundred compressions and expansions. Now let''s keep the same replacement schedule for the mag spring, and say you load your mags to 10 rounds. So you have to load and fire ten shots for one compression cycle. That means it will take a firing of 75,000 rounds before replacing! If you practice 100 rounds each month, 1200 per year, it will take over 60 years. If you load them to 17, and consistently shoot 100 rounds every month of every year, I think it will be safe to say your magazine spring will outlast you :)\n\nHere''s some more misinformation...\n\nTrue, a revolver completely eliminates spring issues altogether, but the practice of not keeping a round under the hammer was a necessity of the 1800''s! Thats how the cowboys carried their Colt Single Action Armies, at least the smart ones did. Because once they dropped their gun and if it landed on the hammer (which happens often when you constantly ride, and climb on and off horses), there was nothing between the firing pin and the primer to prevent it from setting off the round. [B]Now, I don''t know exactly when they became standard equipment, but all of my father''s S&W revolvers from the 1950''s have hammer blocks. I am no Taurus expert, I don''t even own one but I would bet good money that their revolvers will all have a hammer block/transfer bar, which prevents discharge from dropping and making it completely safe to load its cylinder to full capacity[/B].[/QUOTE]\n\nSir I am no expert but\n\n [B]DONT RELY ON SAFETY MACHANISMS WHETHER REVOLVER OR PISTOL\n[/B]\nVery simple rule can prevent many mishaps, its not me there are gun experts on net who say that.\n\nI do use the decocker of my pistol but will never decock it with barrel facing my face or anyother unsafe direction\n\nKeeping a pistol loaded with chambered bullet and with safety on, who knows you disengages the safety while taking out of the holster.\n\nI am by no means an expert of the subject, just sharing my thoughts on what I learnt from net.\n\nRegards', ''),

Asking price was 2K each but after long negotiation closed the deal at 5k for 3 Mags.

I admit being a big fool handed over the money and purchased weapon of my choice from Orient Traders where they told me that I cannot submit the DN on my own if I do not have the Token/Receipt (which they never gave me while taking 5K i.e., full amouny).I reported back to them to submit my DN with weapon entered on it for license and what he said I cant believe. He said since you never bought the weapon from us so you will have to give extra 5K and then we will do rest of the job. I was stunned almost in a no position to negotiate so finally settled for extra 3K (open blackmailing) and 1.5K for DCO entry when rest was taking 1K only.The license overall cost me 24.5K and a lot of time I think the worst deal of all times.Dealers name is Hassan Tallal KZ Firearms near Thokar Niaz Baig & I think he is son in law of Hassan Asla Dealer (Ravi Road) a very hypocratic peronality deals very politely but will try to take maximum out of you.And now about weapons which he have can you believe a chinese TT for 27K, which I got for 21K from Hira Arms last week.AVOID THIS DEALER AT ANY COSTWithout money no idea never applied so cant comment on it sorryReally sorry should never use the name of our Nations Father for such cheap things, point takenRegards[/QUOTE]Thanks Brother for the detailed post...\n\n That dealer location is near to me...

It is his / her greed that our brother f.hashmi is injured. Company made a product which is faulty but now they have issued a statement and have identified them as well. They have also asked the dealers not to sell them. Now if some dealer is still selling them, he is to be identified and criticized not the company.\n\nCaracal is only to blamed for not replacing the faulty guns and for not providing after sales services. But you cannot blame them for making faulty guns. Mistakes and errors happens.\n\nAny legal case against Caracal will not stand a chance in the court but against the dealer will definitely do. Why? Because the company has notified about faulty guns (Sadatpk! It is an important hint for you free of cost).\n\nOnce again some are declaring the entire production of Caracal faulty.

Secondly, We need to put the country''s best lawyers team to file the case against the Manufacturer - caracal and Tawazun Holding, royal emirates group - their distributors in Pakistan and the Government of UAE and the Rulers of UAE for not doing anything to protect the lives of the people.\n Thirdly, we need to file the class action lawsuit to ask for refund for each gun sold in Pakistan including the punitive damages for each person who bought this trash gun by paying large sum amount and who was subject to the false promise of re-call and still waiting for these dumb and cruel people to respond.\n \n I would need the statements and witnesses of all the people who are subject to this cruelty in one way the other.

This pistol was supposed to be broken / burst / explode when fired and it just did the same. Why are we astonished when a faulty gun, which is supposed to be broken, brakes?\n\nHow can one claim that Caracal is at fault especially when they have informed that certain batch is faulty.\n\nIt is dealer to blamed for selling the faulty gun. It is his / her greed that our brother f.hashmi is injured. Company made a product which is faulty but now they have issued a statement and have identified them as well. They have also asked the dealers not to sell them. Now if some dealer is still selling them, he is to be identified and criticized not the company.\n\nCaracal is only to blamed for not replacing the faulty guns and for not providing after sales services. But you cannot blame them for making faulty guns. Mistakes and errors happens.\n\nAny legal case against Caracal will not stand a chance in the court but against the dealer will definitely do. Why? Because the company has notified about faulty guns (Sadatpk! It is an important hint for you free of cost).\n\nOnce again some are declaring the entire production of Caracal faulty. I would humbly request them to prove their claim.\n\nIt is very strange that when a CZ''s Pistols fail, we do not declare the entire production or product faulty but when it happens with Caracal, everybody starts criticizing Caracal.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear Brother Leon\nSorry to say but only person not making sense at this time is your good self.

After going through the response here and after conducting thorough research I believe there are only 2 ways to handle this matter. First is to start a worldwide campaign of saving Gun Owners lives by making everyone in the world aware that the Caracal is a manufacturer of Killing Machines and not the guns so the world at large and specifically the Gun Community can be aware of this lethal - suicide weapon and they can save themselves by not buying this trash. Secondly, We need to put the country''s best lawyers team to file the case against the Manufacturer - caracal and Tawazun Holding, royal emirates group - their distributors in Pakistan and the Government of UAE and the Rulers of UAE for not doing anything to protect the lives of the people.[/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#333333]Thirdly, we need to file the class action lawsuit to ask for refund for each gun sold in Pakistan including the punitive damages for each person who bought this trash gun by paying large sum amount and who was subject to the false promise of re-call and still waiting for these dumb and cruel people to respond.[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#333333]I would need the statements and witnesses of all the people who are subject to this cruelty in one way the other.

There''s no escaping the fact that there has to be a huge hole somewhere along the slide, and that''s the part where there''s going to be the least metal, and thereby the least strength. Googling images for "pistol slide failures" will show everything from Sigs Sauers to Hi points, all breaking along the ejection port. But the point is not that it happens to all brands, but that it happens all too frequently with one in particular. When failure rates should be <0.0001% (less than one in a million, estimated) across the industry, Caracals probably fail at a rate of 0.01% (one in ten thousand) or more.

The 9mm round produces more chamber pressure to withstand by the barrel and the handgun itself than that produced by the .45ACP.\n\n[B]9mm chamber pressure varies mostly between [URL="tel:31000-35000"]31000-35000[/URL] Psi''s vs [URL="tel:21000-25000"]21000-25000[/URL] Psi''s of the .45ACP!\n[/B]\nThe only thing that makes the .45ACP a more potent/powerful caliber is the heavier 185-235 grains projectiles...[/QUOTE]\nWith all due respect, I must in turn cut you short sir, for pressure is only part of the equation. A round''s pressure only acts against the chamber/barrel. What acts against the rest of the gun is the force we know as recoil. It is that energy which batters the slide and frame, necessitating the strength of those components. As you noted, at 230 grains (about 15 grams) the average 45ACP projectile has double the mass of a typical 9mm projectile at 115grains. In accordance with Newton''s 3rd law (an equal reaction for every action), the recoil energy from a normal pressure (non +P) 9mm, is half that of the average 45ACP, per pound of gun, with recoil energy being inversely proportional with weight. \nSorry if I got too nerdy, but as a reloader I''m naturally drawn to how ballistic forces act on various components.', ''),

I took along my BRNO model 2 and Russian made Baikal MP 153 12 x76 shotgun to hunt some doves. My son also wanted to have a trigger time as he had none since last year when he hunted his Dove.

Specially the “Lotus Roots” that we call “ Beh” in Sindhi . We treat the “Lotus Root” or “Beh” as a vegetable and since it is a “Root” thus is enriched with all vitamins and minerals as contained by other roots such as potatoes , Turnips etc but the “Lotus Roots” are far more tastier that all other root vegetables.\n\nThe flower of “lotus” has a unique significance in the history and culture of Indian Subcontinent. While studying “Hindu Mythology” I came to know that at the time of creation of universe, the throne of creator god was a lotus flower that floated on the endless Sagar or the “ocean” and one can judge the importance of “Lotus” from  this that as The Cross is the sign of Christianity and David Star is the sign of Judaism , the flower of Lotus is the sign of Hinduism and Hinduism is one of the oldest religions of the Subcontinent.\nI also plant the “lotus” on my lands. Here is a Pictorial of the visit.

With continuously mishandling this incident they have effectively done millions of dollars of damage to their handgun products and their brand name overall. No matter what they do now it will take years to change mindsets of consumers to trust the brand Caracal again. I would not be surprised if soon the entire line of Caracal Pistols, the C, the F and the SC even are discontinued. Such a pity, pure mismanagement and failure to understand and react to a simple situation resulted in irreparable damage to what had the potential to be one of the finest modern handguns of our time.\n\nI urge Caracal to finally ACT and resolve this situation once and for all.

You did a very strange thing .. And its not about desi weapons only do not point any weapon towards anything you do not want to shoot, and as you have mentioned you used to point it towards yourself just to scare your cousins well i dont know how someone can get scared when someone is pointing his gun on his own head its certainly lack of common sense sorry to say, just remember few things a single trigger pull is not the only thing which can cut the thread of life which you think is under your control, a carelessly fired shot can also, a malfunction of weapon also', ''),

As you noted, at 230 grains (about 15 grams) the average 45ACP projectile has double the mass of a typical 9mm projectile at 115grains. In accordance with [COLOR=#ff0000]Newton''s 3rd law[/COLOR] (an equal reaction for every action), the recoil energy from a normal pressure (non +P) 9mm, is half that of the average 45ACP, per pound of gun, with recoil energy being inversely proportional with weight. \nSorry if I got too[SIZE=5] nerdy[/SIZE], but as a reloader I''m naturally drawn to how ballistic forces act on various components.[/B][/QUOTE]\n\n\n\n[B]@Fudgepacker.[/B].........^ Your posts and technical knowledge have always been a great source of enrichment and inspiration here, no issues with your being bit "nerdy", lolz!\n\nOur local manufacturer''s have more powerful, even heavy caliber full auto weapons in the production line than a .45ACP. handgun.\n\nThe cause behind the absence of locally manufactured .45ACP handguns here -[I] logically[/I] - is the local manufacturer''s trend/priority to not get into a whole new project for which even the customer response would be much unsatisfactory, lower. Here, the majority of the simpler class people still have scruples in going from 30 cal to 9mm, leave alone switching from the 9 to the .45!\n\nIt may show up here somewhere down the timeline, since the .45ACP gunner awareness has been increasing recently, but it''s probably still not a feasible project, monetarily.\n\nI agree with you on different [I]equations and forces[/I] employed of ballistics, a[I] Boyle-Mariotte[/I] or some other wise-heads combo acting inside the barrel and a beloved [I]Newton[/I] playing football around the frame.\n\nOur local Boyle-Mariotte however fares well enough inside heavier caliber local barrels and full auto weapons even, and since there''s a spring inserted somewhere in the holy creation as a whole to take off a fair amount of the Newton kickass hell, you''re ultimately standing there with a .45ACP monster frame that probably has 10-15% more recoil forces involved for frame absorption as compared to the 9. This is nothing for even our poor metallurgy standards over here to comply with.\n \nKindly ignore my cutting you short here or any [I]nerdiness[/I] from my part as well, though I feel that just this is probably the healthiest part of forum interactions.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I am probably twice your age, and again similar to 380 Bro, if my Father ever caught me even dry firing in his general direction, let alone chambering a LIVE round, I would get slapped into next week! \nFurthermore, I would not be considered to have a troubled mind, because I don''t post poems about pain, fear, and death in response to people who are trying to teach me something. Afterall, is that not why you are on Pakguns... to learn something and engage in intelligent conversation? That''s why I''m here.

(553868, '22LR - Segmented Hollow Points Situation may arise where we need bullet expansion over and above the properties of the hollow point. Fragmenting or segmented bullets deliver such performance. CCI offers two cartridges with such bullets. One is the hyper velocity, #0064 and the other, the standard velocity, #0074. Upon impact, CCI bullets split into three pieces. With the Winchester #S22LRFSP, upon impact the front of the bullet splits into three pieces along with another piece which is the rear part of the bullet which is a solid core. \n\nFederal and Remington do not offer cartridges with the segment-type bullets.                                                                                                                               \n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]Cartridge Brand[/TD]\n[TD]      CCI[/TD]\n[TD]     CCI[/TD]\n[TD]Winchester[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Cartridge Name[/TD]\n[TD]Segment HP[/TD]\n[TD]Segment HP[/TD]\n[TD]Varmint HE[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Cartridge Designation[/TD]\n[TD]     0064[/TD]\n[TD]    0074[/TD]\n[TD]S22LRFSP[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Bullet - grains[/TD]\n[TD]       32[/TD]\n[TD]      40[/TD]\n[TD]      37[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Bullet Type[/TD]\n[TD]Fragment HP[/TD]\n[TD]Fragment HP[/TD]\n[TD]Fragment HP[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Velocity - Muzzle[/TD]\n[TD]      1640[/TD]\n[TD]     1050[/TD]\n[TD]     1400[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]              - 25 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]      1452[/TD]\n[TD]     1003[/TD]\n[TD]     1292[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]              - 50 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]      1292[/TD]\n[TD]       963[/TD]\n[TD]     1196[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]              - 75 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]      1162[/TD]\n[TD]       928[/TD]\n[TD]      1125[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]              - 100 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]      1066[/TD]\n[TD]       897[/TD]\n[TD]      1070[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Energy - Muzzle[/TD]\n[TD]        191[/TD]\n[TD]        98[/TD]\n[TD]        161[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]             - 25 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]        150[/TD]\n[TD]        89[/TD]\n[TD]        137[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]             - 50 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]        119[/TD]\n[TD]        82[/TD]\n[TD]        118[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]             - 75 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]         96[/TD]\n[TD]        77[/TD]\n[TD]        104[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]             - 100 Yards[/TD]\n[TD]          81[/TD]\n[TD]        72[/TD]\n[TD]          94[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\nNOTE: Velocity is in feet per second.

(553874, '22LR - Bullet Kinetic Energy At times we need a 22LR cartridge with the high bullet kinetic energy. Just because a cartridge is the leader in this aspect  at the muzzle, it does not mean that it will retain that lead downrange. Some very high velocity cartridges with light bullets deliver high bullet kinetic energy at the front end. They are overtaken by cartridges with heavier bullets and slower muzzle velocity. \n\nThe cartridges included in this list are American make CCI , Federal, Remington and Winchester. Excluded from this list are cartridges that have muzzle velocity of less than 1,220 feet per second. Table lists cartridge name, muzzle velocity [MV], muzzle Energy [ME] at the muzzle, 25, 50, 75 and 100 yards. Data for the highest muzzle velocity and the highest bullet energy for the included cartridges is highlighted in the table. \n\nThe CCI Velocitor [0047] & Winchester Hyper Speed [HXV22LR] are kinetic energy winners at 100 yards.

The Velocitor’s bullet energy exceeds that of the Stinger past 60 yards. Differences in point of impact between the two cartridges for the given zero-set distances are displayed in the table above - they are minimal.\n \nCCI’s another load [0064] is the 32-grain CPSHP - copper plated segmented hollow point cartridge. Except for the design of its bullet, all other specifications [velocity, bullet energy, point of impact, ballistic coefficient, etc.] are the same as that of the Stinger cartridge.\n\n[B]How to Read the Table[/B]: Downrange distances are given column 1. For a given range distance, bullet velocity and bullet energy data is listed in column 2 and column 3 respectively. Data for Stinger is listed first and followed by data for the Velocitor. Point of impact data appears under the respective columns for zero-set distances of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 yards[B]. \n [/B]\n[B]Here is[/B] [B]Example[/B]: Zero-Set 60 at Yards. Range is 75 yards. Display bullet velocity, bullet energy and point of impact for the Stinger & Velocitor cartridges.\n\n[B]Bullet Velocity[/B]: Look down in column 1 and see “[B]75[/B]”. Read across in column 2: “[B]1155/1144[/B]”. Bullet velocity of Stinger is 1155 feet per second.  Bullet velocity of Velocitor is 1144 feet per second.\n\n[B]Bullet Energy[/B]: Look down in column 1 and see“[B]75[/B]”. Read across in column 3: “[B]94.72/100.8[/B]”. Bullet energy of the Stinger is 94.72 foot-pounds and that of Velocitor, 100.8 foot-pounds.\n\n[B]Bullet-Drop[/B]: Look Down in column 1 and see “[B]75[/B]”. Read across in column 5: “[B]-0.76/-0.88[/B]”. Bullet drop for Stringer is 0.76 inch. Bullet drop for Velocitor is 0.88 inch.', ''),

You did a very strange thing .. And its not about desi weapons only do not point any weapon towards anything you do not want to shoot, and as you have mentioned you used to point it towards yourself just to scare your cousins well i dont know how someone can get scared when someone is pointing his gun on his own head its certainly lack of common sense sorry to say, just remember few things a single trigger pull is not the only thing which can cut the thread of life which you think is under your control, a carelessly fired shot can also, a malfunction of weapon also[/QUOTE]\n\nwhen i chambered the round i had pointed the gun towards the wall. as mentioned 5 inch deep hole in concrete wall.', ''),

They wont allow me in but by now the gate guard knows me well. \r\n\r\nI went in and was asked by the Section Officer (Arms) to sit for ''2 minutes''. And he will stamp my license. The 2 minutes stretched to 2 hours. And then 4 and then 5. A steady stream of people came and had their licenses and documents stamped by him. But he kept on saying  the same thing to me "2 minutes" When I urged him to take a look at my documents. He said he has a weak heart and is very ill and busy. \r\n\r\nHe said that I have great powers of persistence since I am still sitting there after all these hours. He offered me tea and fresh grapefruit juice. \r\n\r\nBut then he had people calling him to tell him to do my work. \r\n\r\nAround 2 PM he said he had to go to the wash room. He said he will be back in ''2 minutes'' And he left and did not bother to return. He knew quite well that I have a job and cannt really afford another sit-a-thon\r\n\r\nI waited till around quarter past 3. And tried to give my documents to the staff there. They refused to take it. \r\n\r\nI had already submitted my application and documents before. But I was told that they had been ''lost''. Luckiliy they were onlu copies.

(554011, ' Following email received from Caracal and reply below. \n\n[quote]\nDear Mr Abbas,\n \nThank you for your email dated 9th of September 2013.\n \nWe would like to extend our thoughts and prayers to Mr Syed Fayyez Hashmi and his family.\n \nIn response to your comments, we wish to note the following:\n \n1.  We are aware of only 2 emails that we have received from you, which were dated the 26th of June as well as this one dated the 9th of September.  If there have been any other emails sent to us, we have unfortunately not received them.\n \n2.  We assure you that we take this information very seriously and we are giving this incident the highest priority.  As you  know, we recently issued a recall of all Model C''s in an effort to address certain safety concerns with these firearms. \n \nPlease note that when any incident occurs that appears to involve one of our products,  it is a part of our process and procedure to immediately start an investigation to help us quickly determine the facts regarding what has gone wrong and why.  As you know many factors can contribute to events such as that reported below and we aim to determine whether our product has failed to function as intended and the root cause of any such malfunction.  In this particular instance, we began this investigation within 12 hours of receiving the report and our team of cross functional experts from all departments are involved in the investigation and are doing their utmost to collect the facts, understand the circumstances and act accordingly.\n \nWe have already reached out to Mr. Hashmi; however we thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond to your queries.\n \nMay peace be upon you.\n \nBest Regards,\n \nCaracal International[/quote]\n\n\nSalam Brother,\n\nThank you for your email. I do understand quite well the procedure that your company has to go through as it has already gone though it before with no result. I received similar communication from Caracal when the last gun blew up after which I also met your management and nice as they all are, they are not very effective and also not telling the truth. \n\nThe guns are faulty, your management is well aware of that, the people who own the guns are well aware of that and the gun owing community is aware of that. So I would request that we move past this "we are looking into it" stage as we''ve been there and done that months ago. As for the recall, simply issuing a statement and then doing nothing for months on end is not the way a recall is handled. Any responsible company gets it''s faulty products out of the market ASAP so as to avoid any incidents. Timing becomes critical when the products are potentially life threatening. If you''ve issued a recall then tell us an authorized dealer address which we can visit, return the gun, get it removed from our licence and get the money back which we paid for it. That''s it, it''s quite simple, there is no other recall process. \n\nI appreciate the fact you''ve reached out to Mr. Hashmi but you also reached out to Mr. Khan previously several times with no result. From anyone perspective it''s just a time wasting exercise to get things to cool off till the next gun explodes.\n\nIf another person is injured or dies by another Caracal exploding then it''s only the company and it''s management that is responsible as it is the one that has been delaying an actual recall with empty words. \n\nI have met your management and they seem like sensible and decent people. I fail to understand how they are not dropping everything else and focusing solely to remove these guns from the hands of the users. If Caracal or your distributor is unable to then the PakGuns community can do you a favour and tell you how to proceed. But kindly understand, empty words and ''investigations'' and ''research'' by your panel of experts is not going to solve anything. Everyone knows including your team what is wrong, it''s time to ACT.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nAbbas\n\np.s In the interest of the community I will share this email on the forum.', ''),

This guy needs to get with the program, it''s too late for that,  an international recall has already been launched :lol: Then to top it off, its not even a signed letter! Just best regards, Caracal Int''l. That is plain insulting.

Some bad people are not just satisfied with robbing you. If the bg wants "more" than just worldly possessions such as your life or your body, then by all means, do what you have to. But imagine if Zeeshan Bro had resisted, say he drew his gun and shot. It''s not like in the movies, the robber won''t just fall dead to the ground, but likely will start firing back indiscriminately. Who knows what the result would have been, or who would have got hit. I read a study about police shootings, and i forget the exact number, but it was something like only 1 out of 5 shots fired actually hit the intended target. Remember, this is coming from trained professionals who probably practice a lot more than the average armed civillian. The way Zeeshan handled the situation, he saved his loved ones without injury, and doesn''t have to live the rest of his life with the thought of having killed somebody, and doesn''t have any worries about retaliation either. Over here, when police are involved in a shooting, they are required to have psychological treatment.

However in the case of the open slide berreta 92 series of pistols and their derivatives its not applied. \n\nThe berreta website specificity states that their weapon can be loaded and fired easily without the mag. Its supposed to help the shooter continue to fight even if his mag is broken/lost. \n\nindeed thats one of the reasons why I carry the PT 92. based onteh berreta open slide design. I top up the weapon by dropping a round in the chamber and then put in the full 17 round mag. \n\nthis way I dont have to go through the hassle of  racking the slide and taking out the magazine and then pushing that stubborn last round in the mag.And later when I unload the peice I have to do the same. I.e take out the last round and then try and push it back in the magazine. My poor nails are happy now. :)[/QUOTE]\n\nYes, Ed bhai you are right as always. :) I find this rule only for PT-909 or may be we can say for 900''s series of Taurus.\n\nOne thing I noticed and I am pretty sure you already know about it, the 900 series don''t have a fix barrel which 92 has, when you move the slide back the barrel also comes back with it about 1 cm and the mouth of the barrel, where the chamber is, moves downward (closer to magazine) couple of degrees. And I am not sure why!\n\nDropping a round from the top do not work very well with PT-909. Means if I try to feed a round to the chamber with out a magazine i.e. Manually, it hangs the round and the barrel don''t come back to its original position.

It proves that they are not only handicapped in their management skills but also habtual liars. I read that Caracal is claiming that they have reached to "Mr. Fayyaz hashmi"... I am Fayyaz Hashmi and I declare under oath that I have sent the following email to Caracal on September 8th: \n\n[FONT=arial]Dear Sir,[/FONT][FONT=arial]\nI am Sayed Fayyaz Hussain Hashmi from Lahore Pakistan.I have recently purchased a caracal C and with my test of the gun,the barrel blew up and made me unconcious for a while to woke up with bad injuries. I barely scaped death.\nI am a lawyer by profession and have very busy practice, Now I am in lot of pain and when my team has searched on the net,We found out that the Caracal C is subject to Re-call.\nI didn''t understand at the moment why it''s still being sold in the market.Any how I just wanted to inform you about this.\nMy legal team has also searched and found that there are more then few victoms,which you have left in Pakistan.\nI hereby request you to stop selling this deadly weapon in pakistan and stop the people from using it who have bought this.\nI hope that you will listen to my plea before I take all of you to the court for your day of judgment.\nCheck these pic''s and see what they have done to me. I promise you, I will not spare any one including the Government of UAE and your rulers who let you out to kill the people with these deadly weapons.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\nSyed Fayyaz hussain Hashmi\n\nAnd today on 13th September even after 5 days I didn''t receive any email reply from Caracal.\n[B]\nThis mean these guys are absolutely liars whom one cannot trust.

What they have done here is - they have insulted all pakistanis as a Nation. When it comes to our Nation we stand too firm.

(554132, ' Penetration has as much to do with the type of projectile as much as velocity. A bullet with "knock down power" is designed NOT to penetrate (ie JHP bullets) so the target absorbs all the energy. If the bullet passes through, it''s energy goes with it. You can not judge power by putting a ruler to a cartridge. The reason a 7.62x25(30 bore) is faster is because it is a "necked" cartridge. All things being equal, a necked cartridge will be faster, like if you put your thumb over the end of a garden hose, that same amount of water will come out faster. \nBut all things are not equal, even for ammo of the same caliber. We have to consider how much powder is in the cartridge (they are not filled to the top), and different kinds/brands of powder also have different burn properties, the length of barrel the bullet is being shot from (again all things being equal, a longer barrel produces higher velocities). That is why bullet speed is generally not calculated, but rather it is measured, by using a chronograph. Energy however is calculated  [Muzzle energy = velocity X (bullet weight X bullet weight) / 450,450] but remember, depending on the type of projectile, more energy doesn''t nessecarily mean more stopping power.', ''),

I would hold off on the litigation for a week,  let''s see if in the next 7 days a miracle can happen and Caracal starts carrying out an actual recall instead of more useless talk and delaying tactics. \n\nIn your posts there was also some reference to Arab princes, I would request you and everyone else to kindly keep any of them out of this.', ''),

Let''s say 5''. As accelerated by gravity at 32''/second/second. Let''s use 0.5 seconds... approximately\nThat means after firing, the bullet has half a second before it lands.\n\nThe muzzle velocity of a 9mm load is about 1200fps. Therefore if fired parallel to the ground, it would travel about 600 feet (180 meters) before it burries itself.\n\nThats pretty nerdy stuff for people who aren''t into ballistics, but one useful fact derived from those calculations is that the point blank range of a 9mm round is between 20-25m.

(554494, 'How often should you unload your concealed carry firearm magazine? These questions seems to pop up a lot; How often should I empty my magazine? Should I alternate magazines? What happens to my springs? The truth is this; If you are running a modern firearm, keeping your magazines full will not hurt them in the long run. A well-manufactured spring in your magazine is designed to hold the load of rounds for long periods of time and should not weaken the spring to the point of being useless. Some manufacturers will say to alternate magazines x-amount of months, but it is our understanding that most do not even mention it in their literature.\n There are benefits to unloading your magazines, such as cleaning. If you carry the same magazine with the same rounds on a daily basis, dirt and debris will naturally start to build up. Every once in a while, it is recommended to unload and give everything a nice cleaning. This includes the rounds that are in the magazine. A quick wipe with a towel (make sure not to leave debris from the towel on any rounds) should do the trick.\n Another thing to keep in mind if you live in a warmer climate; Remember that your body sweats, and sweat can make its way into a magazine. While most modern manufactured ammo is extremely well put together, you always run the risk of moisture making its way into a round. We personally cycle through carry ammo every few months, especially during the summer, but that is completely up to you. It’s more of a ‘better safe than sorry’ mentality for us.\n So there you have it. After much research and personal experience, that is our two cents on the subject.\n Carry On.\n\n[url]http://www.concealednation.org/2013/09/how-frequently-should-you-unload-your-concealed-carry-firearm/[/url]', ''),

Some bad people are not just satisfied with robbing you. If the bg wants "more" than just worldly possessions such as your life or your body, then by all means, do what you have to. But imagine if Zeeshan Bro had resisted, say he drew his gun and shot. It''s not like in the movies, the robber won''t just fall dead to the ground, but likely will start firing back indiscriminately. Who knows what the result would have been, or who would have got hit. I read a study about police shootings, and i forget the exact number, but it was something like only 1 out of 5 shots fired actually hit the intended target. Remember, this is coming from trained professionals who probably practice a lot more than the average armed civillian.

Let''s say 5''. As accelerated by gravity at 32''/second/second. Let''s use 0.5 seconds... approximately\nThat means after firing, the bullet has half a second before it lands.\n\nThe muzzle velocity of a 9mm load is about 1200fps. Therefore if fired parallel to the ground, it would travel about 600 feet (180 meters) before it burries itself.\n\nThats pretty nerdy stuff for people who aren''t into ballistics, but one useful fact derived from those calculations is that the point blank range of a 9mm round is between 20-25m. So unless your sights are zeroed at longer range, remember to hold over when trying to hit a target beyond that distance.[/QUOTE]\n\nThankyou sir for the reply\n9mm will travel about 600 feet approx and what about 30 bore ?\nI am asking this question because I love 30 bore bullet but 30 bore TTs are no good nowadays had a pretty bad experience few days back\n\nRegards', ''),

(562488, 'living with an ankle holster I''ve been carrying my Ruger LCP in an ankle holster for the last six weeks or so.  I wound up with an Uncle Mike''s "#2" size to fit the gun.  As are all of the mass-market ankle holsters, it''s thick woven nylon with Velcro, bulkier than it has to be.   The thickness of the two sides of the holster and the Velcro''d straps on each side is more than the pistol itself.\r\n\r\n This holster is one of the kind with the support strap that goes below the knee; I couldn''t see any point in grinding a strapless holster against the top of my shoe.\r\n\r\n Anyway, I wasn''t sure I''d like the ankle holster, but I was willing to give it a try.  After the first day, I barely noticed its presence; after the second day I didn''t notice it at all.  The LCP is very small and light, and the holster doesn''t chafe or bind.\r\n\r\n The holster is machine-washable, so I just throw it in the laundry once a week to get the sweat, dirt, grass clippings, etc. out.  \r\n\r\n I still think the holster could be less bulky, but all of the ones on the market seem to be pretty much the same, no matter who makes them.

However, there was a production over-run of ~ 358 units, and only 343 were actually imported in 1990 by Kiesler Police Supply of Indiana, USA. Gun has a 19 1/2 inch barrel, 7-shot capacity, express rifle sights (folding), factory sling swivels, and a beautiful wooden stock. It also features a ''Man-Cutter'' adjustable choke designed to send the pellets in a vertical oval shot pattern in hostage situations - or alternately, to dump all of the shot into the main body of the target when turned horizontally. Moreover, SLUGS work perfectly fine in this gun. This rare piece is a must for the serious HK collectors!"[/B]', ''),

(554775, ' Dear Abbas / Mr. Hashmi and Respected Members of Pak Guns Community,\n\nI am Dr. Kaiser from Royal Emirates Group. Kindly allow me to share my thoughts. This is absolutely painful to hear what has happened to Mr. Hashmi and Mr. Hashmi, I have no words which I can use to reduce your pain. May Allah give you health. I have just arrived in Pakistan to personaly meet Mr. Hashmi to see how we can be there in this painful time. I admit that we might have lacked in our response a bit but that dosn''t mean we don''t care. We do care about every Caracal Gun User. And especially a member of this gun community. We didn''t forget that upon our request the Chief - my brother Abbas and his aids has taken all of their time out to test the Caracal F, post their honest reviews and then help Caracal grow in Pakistan. The members of this Gun Community not only supported but also promoted the Caracal. When the first unfortunate incident took place, it was trully a shock for us - the distributor''s and the manufacturer because this was the first incident ever happened with Caracal anywhere in the world. I am being Pakistani was even more in pain to see my brother K. Khan who''s family suffered the pain. I admit that there was some confusion at the begining but immediately I have reached out to brother Abbas for guidance and with his sincere guidance we were able to communicate with brother K. Khan and we offered to extend our assistance to help resolve this matter between them and the manufacturer. Brother Abbas and myself we spent hours brain storming to find the ways to move forward and not only to work out the details of the re-call but also to benefit the PG community with many activities. Brother Abbas with his mountain of experience and his utmost sincerity with the PG community was taking all the time out from his busy work in dubai and was helping and guiding our team. We finally prepared the draft and sent to manufacturer which resulted in the full Caracal C recall and also to form the committee to work out the implementations of the suggestions given by brother Abbas. At that time our goal was to first replace all Caracal C and replace the Grip of Caracal F and then implement all the suggestions. We immediately prepared the re-call letter and humbly requested all Caracal C gun owners to stop using their weapons and requested all dealers to stop selling the Caracal C weapons. The biggest challenge was that Government of Pakistan doesn''t allow any weapon export out of the country neither allow the import of the replacement weapons. We went to many doors including the interior and shipping ministry to no avail. It was an election season and no one has given us the answer despite making several attempts. While working on this there was an internal merge which took place within Tawazun which resulted in the change of the management at Caracal. The new Team - didn''t have any idea about the past circumstances but I can assure you that they are extremly sincere in making the efforts to complete the re-call process in Pakistan as early as possible as well as take care of all the concerns of the community. They also sincerely regard the efforts of brother Abbas.\n\nAlthough it took longer than expected but its assured that there was not a day when we didn''t think about this pending re-call issue and we didn''t make efforts to work things out. We were sure that the dealers will not sell Caracal C and the users will not use the gun as we have advised and requested and we will somehow make up to the community for our delay time. But during this time one of the dealer over looked the warning and sold the Carcal C to Mr. Hashmi and Mr. Hashmi not knowing the facts - just fired the gun and unfortunately it resulted in this grave injury. \nMr. Hashmi - I came to pakistan only to meet you. I have sent you my local number via email. Please contact me as early as possible so we can either meet today or tomorrow. I am here on behalf of Caracal and behalf of Royal Emirates to sit down with you and discuss and take care of all of your concerns. \n\nBrother Abbas, I will also give you a call today so we can once again sit down and discuss how Royal Emirates and Caracal can be benefitted with your experience and sincere advise. \n\nSincere Regards, \n\nDr. Kaiser \nManaging Director / partner \nRoyal Emirates Group \nSole Distributors - Caracal', ''),

Dont forget, Baikal may be "owned" by Izhmash but its only because they went bankrupt, and part of the bail out plan was to merge them with the also financially troubled Izhevsk and other small companies.

Its not US but Pakistan internet recall notices never reach intended community even your dealers dont bother giving them an ear so are keeping their sale on.\n\nFor God sake take proactive action instead of trying to cover up by reaching people reported their misery & trying to collect the [B]broken guns only[/B].  \n\nI assure you bro that Caracal will reap positive market goodwill once they go like suggested otherwise they may will sell their remaining stock in Pakistan benefiting internet illiteracy BUT their actual reputation will surely be effected in International market as there are lot bigger markets outside the Pakistan where gun users are lot more internet literate than here.', ''),

This is absolutely painful to hear what has happened to Mr. Hashmi and Mr. Hashmi, I have no words which I can use to reduce your pain. May Allah give you health. I have just arrived in Pakistan to personaly meet Mr. Hashmi to see how we can be there in this painful time. I admit that we might have lacked in our response a bit but that dosn''t mean we don''t care. We do care about every Caracal Gun User. And especially a member of this gun community. We didn''t forget that upon our request the Chief - my brother Abbas and his aids has taken all of their time out to test the Caracal F, post their honest reviews and then help Caracal grow in Pakistan. The members of this Gun Community not only supported but also promoted the Caracal. When the first unfortunate incident took place, it was trully a shock for us - the distributor''s and the manufacturer because this was the first incident ever happened with Caracal anywhere in the world. I am being Pakistani was even more in pain to see my brother K. Khan who''s family suffered the pain. I admit that there was some confusion at the begining but immediately I have reached out to brother Abbas for guidance and with his sincere guidance we were able to communicate with brother K. Khan and we offered to extend our assistance to help resolve this matter between them and the manufacturer. Brother Abbas and myself we spent hours brain storming to find the ways to move forward and not only to work out the details of the re-call but also to benefit the PG community with many activities. Brother Abbas with his mountain of experience and his utmost sincerity with the PG community was taking all the time out from his busy work in dubai and was helping and guiding our team. We finally prepared the draft and sent to manufacturer which resulted in the full Caracal C recall and also to form the committee to work out the implementations of the suggestions given by brother Abbas. At that time our goal was to first replace all Caracal C and replace the Grip of Caracal F and then implement all the suggestions. We immediately prepared the re-call letter and humbly requested all Caracal C gun owners to stop using their weapons and requested all dealers to stop selling the Caracal C weapons. The biggest challenge was that Government of Pakistan doesn''t allow any weapon export out of the country neither allow the import of the replacement weapons. We went to many doors including the interior and shipping ministry to no avail. It was an election season and no one has given us the answer despite making several attempts. While working on this there was an internal merge which took place within Tawazun which resulted in the change of the management at Caracal. The new Team - didn''t have any idea about the past circumstances but I can assure you that they are extremly sincere in making the efforts to complete the re-call process in Pakistan as early as possible as well as take care of all the concerns of the community. They also sincerely regard the efforts of brother Abbas.\n\nAlthough it took longer than expected but its assured that there was not a day when we didn''t think about this pending re-call issue and we didn''t make efforts to work things out. We were sure that the dealers will not sell Caracal C and the users will not use the gun as we have advised and requested and we will somehow make up to the community for our delay time.

(554806, ' well though i like viking mp 446 more and trust it over cf 98 any day, but actually admin Abbas tested caracal F, we need to run the same torture test for these two guns because both are budget guns and are very popular in pakistani market, all other major handguns either budget or hi end guns in pakistani market went through these torture tests like cz handguns internet is full of torture tests same goes for taurus products and glocks etc, the only firearm from baikal which went through such torture test is baikal''s semi auto shotgun mp 153, not only here in pakistan but also on international forums such torture tests are reported in one the guy shot 50,000 cartridges from his mp 153. I think both handguns can not sustain such a torture test but i believe viking will still perform better, as far as calling chinese norinco products crap well its not justified those who are giving examples of russian ak47 are forgetting the type 56 which was also made in china and the old milled reciever type 56 is among then finest durable and reliable rifle in ak platform, yes the new type 56 has serious issues but does anyone own a new russian ak47 here, i have seen brand new type 56 rifles but i have not seen any brand new ak47 rifle in the past so many years, to compare both we need them both side by side, another interesting thing is that those type 56 rifles which were imported to pakistan by a dealer in peshawar are the only type 56 rifles with quality issues because these rifles were imported on special order from govt of pakistan and the dealer wanted to make maximum bucks so quality was compromised, it was one of the biggest fraud according to my knowledge the dealer was arrested when this issue was brought in court. The new norinco type 56 apart from the shipment which was imported to pakistan are extremely well built rifles, remember the main assault rifle of pakistan army is type 56 not ak47, the main battle rifle is pof G3.', ''),

Kindly understand that the brothers at our community and otherwise are understandably a little angry at delay of the practical implementation of the recall which has resulted in another incident. It is heartening to hear that you are here on behalf of Caracal and looking to resolve this issue once and for all in this trip. \n\nI would request you to kindly read the suggestions I put forth in this thread earlier for Caracal recall ( [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?12034-Catastrophic-CARACAL-Failure-IInd-reported-incident&p=391630&viewfull=1#post391630[/URL] ). The most important thing that I have stressed in person and must again is that ''[B]time is of the essence[/B]''. The export/import practical issues that Caracal has faced do sound genuine (elections, weapon export restrictions, replacements importation etc). However I assume that Caracal now understands that the only way forward is to start a cash refund for all Caracal C''s sold immediately. As for re-export of Caracal C''s may I suggest that all C''s should be collected and destroyed here in Pakistan as I''m sure Caracal only needs a few random pieces for testing and not the entire lot. \n\n[U]"I must stress again that practical implementation is the need of the hour."[/U] \n\n[B]@All[/B] Brothers, I request to treat Dr. Kaiser with courtesy as he''s here on my invitation. No disrespectful posts will be tolerated. As I understand the delay is not from the distributor side but from the company side whose new management was struggling to come to speed with the ongoing issue. That said, if practical implementation of the recall does not start to take place within a week then I will be the first to react to Caracal. \n\nMy personal aim is that everyone should benefit, the guns owners/users should get a full cash refund, the model C is lifted completely from the market, the public/potential users informed of the recall via mass media, the two affected gentlemen compensated and by doing all of the above the company Caracal will be able to salvage it''s reputation and instead be seen as a responsible and consumer oriented company.  \n\nHoping to see this entire 7 month episode come to a fruitful and beneficial end very soon.', ''),

AoA all,\r\n\r\n             The following clipping is from THE NEWS(Paper) of 12th-September 2013.\r\n\r\n"KARACHI: Khyber Pakthunkhwa Shooting Association (KPSA) has requested the provincial government to allot it a piece of land for developing a shooting range. \r\n \r\nInam Ullah Gandapur, Secretary KPSA, told &#8216;The News&#8217; that having no range in the province was a setback for the players. &#8220;This is the reason a great potential in shooting in the province is being wasted,&#8221; he said. \r\n \r\n&#8220;We have identified a land of 52 canals near Garhi Baghbana, Peshawar, for the range. Now we are going to make a request to the provincial government to help us in this regard and allot the land to the association for developing a state-of-the-art range,&#8221; added the legendary shooter of the country. \r\n \r\nHe said if they were allotted this land by the end of this year, they could develop a range of international standard for all events within a year. &#8220;I am helping shooters of the province by allowing them to practice at my private range, but if we are to excel in this sport it is not enough,&#8221; he added. \r\n \r\nHe said that for winning medals at the international level there was need for a good shooting range in the province. &#8220;It is known to everybody that people of KP have natural talent for this sport. Once this range is developed with the help of the government, we can perform exceptionally well in this sport,&#8221; he said. \r\n \r\nInamullah said that due to the absence of a shooting range the athletes were not having competitions and since they didn&#8217;t get practice they skipped national events. &#8220;This is evident from the non-participation of KPSA&#8217;s team in both national shooting championship and CNS championship held in Karachi this year,&#8221; he said. \r\n \r\n&#8220;This is an expensive sport. So the government needs to share the burden. Though National Rifle Association gives us a lot of support, it is still not enough,&#8221; he added. \r\n \r\nHe further said that some non-professional elements were also hurting this sport in the province."\r\n\r\n\r\n Great initiative by Gandapur Sahib,but in my view 52-Kanals are far TOO LESS to meet ISSF\r\n standards of having at least 5 combined Skeet & Trap ranges.\r\n \r\n Surprisingly, Dr Inam Gandapur Sahib has claimed that,"KP shooters have NATURAL TALENT for\r\n shooting sports".

(555341, ' Thanks a lot 1st Stranger bro! Your prayers were answered. :)\n\nI got the upgraded lic today. I can now purchase .22/.222/.223 on semi auto instead of just .22\n\nOf course he did what he did only after receiving certain phone calls. And also informed me that he had paid  the high officers from his own pocket since the individual calling him was some1 he cannot say no to. \n\nEffectively ensuring that not just me but no one else will try and get this upgrade for free. \n\nHe also told me that the computerised licenses issued by the Home Dep. are bribe free and  he only follows the rule of the law. \nHowever since the license that he had stamped and signed had been issued only after paying 25k I seriously  seriously doubted what he said. \n\nHe was very interested in people''s opinions of him on the forum.  (I told him about PG and how most of us would love to come to him rather then going to dealers) I think he got scared and refused to give me rates.  He prefers the discretion of dealers rather then people who walk into his office and ask him to do stuff for free :D\n\n\n\nAs regards bribes. I could not even get on the road to the home dep without paying those. I was supposed to get a visitor pass, but the person giving the passes was not there. (and even he asked for some ''gift'' when ever he was around) Soo I paid the gate keeper to allow me on the road itself. Later on I managed to sneak past the building guard but was stopped by the guards outside the department itself. They all wanted gifts. They did let me go through cause they thought I looked Shareef (decent) and they knew I could not get the gate pass since there was no1 issuing it. \n\nTotal number of trips : Around half a dozen. \nTotal bribes given: 150 (3 trips to the road  gate keeper Rs. 50 each)\n\nProspect of doing this all over again. I dont think I can. Unless i want to lose my job. \n\nAmount saved Rs. 30k\n\nThe permit will be used to review .222 & .223 weapons, their rates, their reliability, availability etc. etc. \n\nP.S i did see at least 1 carry permit of a fellow member being signed by him.', ''),

The Rifle is around 14 years old, and any older wouldn''t be a 7mm Remington as 2000 is when the BRNO 7mm Remington came to market. I have yet to see it in person as it is in a different city but planning a visit soon but need opinions first.\n\nCan the owners of these genuine BRNO 7mm Rem please give their input? [B]I think [U]Aquarius brother[/U] has one[/B] (read in an archived thread). This is not the one with the magazine.\n\nI have questions if I may:\n\n- Are BRNO 7mm Remington clones made in Pak? If yes, how does one differentiate between genuine and local clones? (as far as my limited knowledge is concerned, 7mm Mauser is the favoured choice of local manufacturers and not the 7mm Remington)\n\n- What should I expect the price to be for a 14 years old, NIB and genuine BRNO 7mm Rem?\n\n\n\nHe also stocks NIB Parker-Hale 7mm, and that is the 7mm Mauser. Parker-Hale seems to be a hit and a miss, as some say the machinery and tools were bought by a company in Lahore, and there is another saying that it is assembled here, some are un-marked and the ones shipped from UK have Parker-Hale Birmingham England stamped on the barrel hidden by the stock.\n\nAnd then he also has Santa Barbara 7mm (Spanish Rifle - as per google) .... did not check whether it was 7mm Mauser or 7mm Rem.

The production time for a stamped metal part, including deburring, is much faster, the process simpler, and as cheap if not cheaper. With machining metal, there is no wastage, all the excess is reused. I don''t have problems with polymer, but IMHO a metal component is always more desirable than a plastic one. Many manufacturers currently take advantage of the cost savings of injection moulding while still producing a metal part, as evidenced by the proliferation of MIM parts in today''s new guns. Or, my favorite approach is that used by Glock in their magazines, a "hybrid" so to speak, having the best of both worlds. Wear resistance of polymer on the outside, and strength of steel on the inside. But I agree with Trigger Happy, those magazines look incredibly cheap. Regardless of how they work, it affects people''s confidence in the product if it looks like crap. Honestly, when I first saw the pictures, I thought the gun was just resting on some broken piece of plastic, until i looked closer and realized it was a magazine:shocked: \nCosmetically, I can''t believe that is acceptable production standard.', ''),

This is specially for you as what I understood (sorry have say that) you are a young man with a care free & heady attitude; that is quite evident from opening 3 threads in 3 minutes just after going through all that trauma and forth one while mods were trying to merge all these in one.\n\nSo my brother always treat firearms with respect dont let your over confidence to under estimate the lethality of a mishandled gun. \nFound this thread for you to read: [URL]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?7283-5-things-you-must-not-do-with-gun-for-your-and-others-Safety[/URL].[/QUOTE]\n No more to add!', ''),

But all have different + and - points. The purchaser should know what he wants.\n\nDiana is German made gun. You get German quality when you buy Diana and German quality is off course better than Turkish or Spanish one.\n\nIf you want magnum power in Diana at low cost, you can bue 350 magnum. If you need moderate power in Diana, you can get 31 or 34 model. Both are reasonably powered and very accurate. You can hunt at 60 yards. Some hunt at 70 yards.\n\nWhen you go for magnum springer whether it be Diana 350 or Hatsan 125, it becomes difficult to hit accurately.\n\nHatsan is also a well built gun. But dont compare it with Diana''s quality. In lower budget, you can get Hatsan 125. It appears to be reliable, but it is not time tested as much as is Diana 31 or 34.\n\nOur friend Jog3ee hass been using Hatsan 125 with complete satisfaction for more than a year. We have tuned it and it has become soft in cocking.\n\nThen comes Gamo. These are also good guns but terrible triggers. \n\nIf I had to spend Rs. 28k, I would go for Diana 31 Panther. If I had to spend 33K, I would go for Diana 34.\n\nIf I need a comparatively less finished gun with magnum power and low cost, I will buy Hatsan 125.\n\nBut I shall not buy Gamo.\n\nThat is my personal choice.\n\nNow keeping in view the above, one can choose which gun one wants to buy.', ''),

He observed that “the arms which flow from the South into Karachi come from India and Israel and the arms which flow from the North into Karachi come from NATO, US and Russia. If we are determined then not a single bullet will come into the country through illegal paths. Rocket launchers and anti aircraft guns were also recovered from the city.” He further remarked that the “Police officers who took part in Karachi operation during 1992 and 1996 were culled and murdered. Had the killers of police personnel been arrested, police morale would have been higher today.” The CJP inquired about the murder of witnesses and remarked that such an action is impossible without the collusion between police and influential persons. The CJP made these statements while presiding over a 5-member bench of SC during the hearing of the Karachi violence case. The other members of the bench are Justice Jawwad S Khawaja, Justice Khilji, Arif Hussain, Justice Amir Hani Muslim and Justice Azmat Saeed. The Federal government, chief secretary Sindh and the police presented the report on the Karachi situation in the court. The report alleged that the ISI and MI had declared an ongoing target operation in Karachi effective and had proposed to continue it. One police station in each of the five districts of Karachi is being controlled by the Rangers. As per report, 1357 accused persons involved in target killing, extortion of money and other crimes were arrested during September, 5 to 16 in Karachi and 3 Kalashnikovs, 347 pistols and 9 hand grenades were recovered from them.

(556234, ' Hello Matapata,\nI hope there can be a solution to your scope problem. and it is easy.\nYour scope is not focusing beyond a certain distance. This is due to shifting of objective lens inside the tube due to repeated recoils of air gun.\nThe procedure to correct is as follows:\nfirst, remove the retaining ring from objective end of scope (end away from eye). Unscrew it completely and put aside.\nNow look through your scope at a distant object where you mostly shoot or hunt (may be 50 yards). Rotate the objective lens counterclockwise as if unscrewing it, but dont remove it completely. keep looking at your target through scope. At a point it will become clear. Stop at this point and screw the retaining ring which you removed earlier. It works to hold the lens housing in place. Just dont take the focus too far, or it will make the near objects unclear. so keep a balance so that your minimum shooting distance (say 10-15 yards) and far distance (say 70-80 yards) are both in focus.\nHope I have not made it too complicated. \nIf problem is still unsolved give me ur e-mail here for detailed contact.\nBest of luck....', ''),

(556380, ' Allah Ka Shukar hai that no one is hurt. No monetary asset is worth a life, and you did the right thing brother. The armed robbers (whether affiliated with a big gang or just a few friends) get on the street with a mindset that majority of us are not ready for. Our family, as a general rule, always keep minimum 5K cash on us so if such an incident was to happen, it is better to give the robber(s) something to leave with instead of a 30Rs bullet in our system - this guy had absolutely nothing on him, and it was noon when all shops are open he was held at gunpoint in the open in busy D-Ground in FSD, the robbers said ''kuch nahi hai to goli kha'' and shot his knee!. And armed guards of banks and shops (almost all are totally incompetent) stood by and let it happen.\n\nWe have had 2 armed robberies in the immediate family, one house and one clinic and showed no resistance so no one was harmed physically but mentally it was a major shock that took a long time to overcome especially for those in the house - we found the robbers ourselves and then called in the police for the raid. DSP was an utterly useless fat b**t*rd who walked into the house and demanded tea and food, and after the raid we had to have his nuts tightened by ISI to get the many items out of him - a few lakhs we had collected from within the family for our Kashmiri brothers and sisters after the earthquake were never recovered and probably DSP feasted with that money I''m sure. House robbers were caught same night of robbery & clinic robbers were caught a few months later with the car recovered as well). Out of the 2 house robbers one was a Hafiz-e-Quran!! and the other a policeman! After a few months of ''disappearing off the police radar'' and lots of beating by ISI until they were literally skeletons, we forgave them in the court instead of starting a lifetime of dushmani. I was the first one in the house after the robbery and when that Hafiz was caught, I wanted to cut his tongue, hands, feet with his own knife and stick a screwdriver deep in his ears for what happened in the house and the state my family members were in. That was the most furious I had ever been in my life. I have not forgiven him ...', ''),
(556381, 'There is one more important thing [QUOTE=adam;394190]Hello Matapata,\nI hope there can be a solution to your scope problem. and it is easy.\nYour scope is not focusing beyond a certain distance. This is due to shifting of objective lens inside the tube due to repeated recoils of air gun.\nThe procedure to correct is as follows:\nfirst, remove the retaining ring from objective end of scope (end away from eye). Unscrew it completely and put aside.\nNow look through your scope at a distant object where you mostly shoot or hunt (may be 50 yards). Rotate the objective lens counterclockwise as if unscrewing it, but dont remove it completely. keep looking at your target through scope. At a point it will become clear. Stop at this point and screw the retaining ring which you removed earlier. It works to hold the lens housing in place. Just dont take the focus too far, or it will make the near objects unclear. so keep a balance so that your minimum shooting distance (say 10-15 yards) and far distance (say 70-80 yards) are both in focus.\nHope I have not made it too complicated. \nIf problem is still unsolved give me ur e-mail here for detailed contact.\nBest of luck....[/QUOTE]\n\nWhen you adjust the Objective lense, be careful that it should be set at that distance where you shoot most of the time.  I mean that you should not only see the clarity of picture but should also consider the parallax.\n\nFor this purpose, put your scope on some hard surface and see through it from eye piece end from where normally the scopes are lokked through.  Then point out an aim point at the distance where you most of the time hit that is normally 35 yards.\n\nNow rotate objective lense and keep looking through the scope and also move your eye from left to right and right to left.\n\nYou will find that the cross hair will move with the movement of your eye.  You have to leave the object lense at such place, that you shifting of eye position should not result in movement of cross hair.\n\nThis will be your best place where you should leave your objective lense. Then tight the ring.', ''),

(556523, ' I remember reading this in a Reader''s Digest back in the 1970''s.  It is a true story and it gave me a chuckle.\n \nThis elderly lady took her 1970''s Chevy to her car dealer and told him  she had a problem with it.  When the service manager asked her what the  problem was, she told him that she did volunteer work for her church,  and every day when she left work, she''s stop at a local ice cream parlor  and pick up a half pint of ice cream to eat after her dinner that  night.  She said that if she bought chocolate or vanilla ice cream, she  had no problem, but if bought butter brickle ice cream, her car wouldn''t  start.  \n \nThe service manager thought she might be a bit senile, but when she  offered to show him, he agreed.  She drove him to her church, then she  left church and drove to the ice cream parlor.  She stopped in and  bought a half pint of chocolate ice cream.  She got back in her car and  it started right up, so she drove home, put the ice cream in her  freezer, then drove back to church.  Once she got to her church, she  drove back to the ice cream parlor.  She went in and bought a half pint  of butter brickle ice cream.  When she got back out to her car, she  tried to start it and it wouldn''t start.  The service manager got behind  the wheel and he couldn''t start it either.  After numerous attempts,  the car finally started.  The woman drove home, put the ice cream in her  freezer, then drove back to her church again, where she repeated the  procedure, only this time, when she stopped into the ice cream parlor,  she bought vanilla ice cream.  When she got to her car, it started right  up.  She drove home, put the ice cream into her freezer, and did the  whole thing all over again....drove to church, then drove to the ice  cream parlor, bought another half pint of butter brickle ice cream, only  this time the service manager tried to start the car first....and the  car wouldn''t start.  The service manager was baffled by all of this.\n \nAfter dropping the woman off at her home, the service manager drove the  car to his service department and went over the car but couldn''t find  anything wrong with it.  He ended up calling Detroit and told them the  problem.  At first, they thought he had been drinking, but eventually  they believed him so they sent a technician there to check it out.  The  technician hooked up a bunch of gauges to the car''s engine and mounted  them on the hood of the car, then they drove the route that the woman  drove to see what was happening.  That''s when they discovered what the  problem was.\n \nWhen the woman bought either chocolate or vanilla, the ice cream parlor  had these popular flavors already pre-packed, so they just handed her a  half pint container that they had filled earlier.  When she asked for  butter brickle, that wasn''t a popular flavor so they didn''t have any  half pint containers pre-packed....they had to dip it while she waited.   That extra few minutes that it took to pack the ice cream caused the  car to develop vapor lock, which prevented the car from starting.(vapor  lock is when the engine''s heat causes the gasoline in the fuel lines to  vaporize, thereby preventing it from starting.)  \n \nThey corrected the problem and everything was okay.  To the elderly  woman, all she knew was that if she bought butter brickle, her car  wouldn''t start.[IMG]http://www.diabetesforums.com/images/smilies/smile.gif[/IMG]', ''),

This will occur at two different distances &#8211; known near and far zero. In common parlance when we speak of zero-set, we refer to the far distance zero. Bullet path takes the shape of a parabolic curve. If we extend as horizontal line through a parabolic curve, that line will cross the parabolic curve at two points. In our discussion here these are the near and far crossing points on the parabolic curve. For the reasons given here, you can zero your weapon at the near zero distance and expect the bullet to again cross the aim point at the far zero distance. Since a very small error in our aim a short distance magnifies into a larger error down range, we need to check the result on the target at the far zero distance and make any needed sight adjustments.\n \n\nNEAR & FAR ZERO DISTANCE  IN YARDS\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]Cartridge Name - Velocity at muzzle, 50 &  100 yards[/TD]\n[TD] 0.5"[/TD]\n[TD]0.75[/TD]\n[TD]   1.0&#8221;[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]STANDARD VELOCITY CARTRIDGES:[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]CCI 40-gr Subsonic [0056] 1050/963/897[/TD]\n[TD]19/43[/TD]\n[TD]18/47[/TD]\n[TD]17/50[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Federal 40-gr Gold  Medial [711B] 1080/994/930[/TD]\n[TD]20/44[/TD]\n[TD]18/48[/TD]\n[TD]17/51[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Remington 40-gr Subsonic [21141] 1050/965/901[/TD]\n[TD]20/43[/TD]\n[TD]18/47[/TD]\n[TD]17/51[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Winchester 40-gr Super-X [X22LRSUBA] 1065/983/922[/TD]\n[TD]20/43[/TD]\n[TD]18/47[/TD]\n[TD]17/50[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]HIGH VELOCITY CARTRIDGES:[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]CCI 40-gr Mini-Mag [0030] 1235/1092/998[/TD]\n[TD]22/49[/TD]\n[TD]21/53[/TD]\n[TD]19/56[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Federal 40-gr American Eagle [AE5022] 1240/1103/1011[/TD]\n[TD]23/49[/TD]\n[TD]21/53[/TD]\n[TD]19/57[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Remington 40-gr Golden Bullet [21006] 1255/1113/1017[/TD]\n[TD]23/50[/TD]\n[TD]21/54[/TD]\n[TD]20/57[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Winchester 40-gr Wildcat [WW22LR] 1255/1112/1016[/TD]\n[TD]23/50[/TD]\n[TD]21/54[/TD]\n[TD]20/57[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]HYPER VELOCITY CARTRIDGES:[/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]CCI 40-gr Velocitor [0047] 1435/1230/1084[/TD]\n[TD]26/55[/TD]\n[TD]24/60[/TD]\n[TD]22/64[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Federal 31-gr Game Shok [724] 1430/1197/1046[/TD]\n[TD]25/54[/TD]\n[TD]23/59[/TD]\n[TD]22/62[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Remington 36-gr Viper [21080/21288] 1410/1198/1056[/TD]\n[TD]25/54[/TD]\n[TD]23/58[/TD]\n[TD]21/62[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]Winchester 37-gr Varmint HE [S22LRFSP] 1400/1208/1080[/TD]\n[TD]25/54[/TD]\n[TD]23/59[/TD]\n[TD]22/63[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]', ''),

(556768, ' [SIZE=2][FONT=verdana][B]22LR - Clicks in Wallet[/B][/FONT][/SIZE]\n\nHoldover is a technique used to compensate for bullet drop beyond the zero-set distance. For some, it may be difficult to judge as to how much above the target to aim to hit the bulls eye. An easier alternative is to &#8220;dial the target&#8221; on the riflescope elevation knob. Whether you use the holdover technique or &#8220;dial the target&#8221; method, you will need some way of estimating or measuring the distance to target. Shooters find out early on that riflescope elevation adjustment range becomes a factor in long range shooting. It is wise to stay within the mid-range of the scope&#8217;s capability. Point of impact can be raised by elevating the scope at the rear mount by placing aluminum shim-stock [like soda can aluminum]. If this low-cost method does not work, you may need a scope mount with elevation adjustment capability.\n\nUse the table below to dial your target past your zero-set distance.  The table gives the bullet drop in inches for the indicated distances. Beside the number clicks necessary to bring the aim point in alignment, drop in minutes of angle (MOA) is included. For mil-dot riflescope application, drop in mil-radians is also included.\n\nThis is a &#8220;split&#8221; table. For shorter distances the zero-set can be at 50 yards. For extended distances the zero-set can be at 100 yards. \n\nTrajectory data is for high velocity Remington 40-gr Golden Bullet [210006]. Winchester 40-gr Wildcat [WW22LR], CCI 40-gr Mini-Mag [0030] & Federal 40-gr American Eagle [AE5022] ballistics track very closely.\n\nDrop shown is in inches. Each click of the scope&#8217;s elevation knob is equivalent to point of impact change of 1/4 inch at 100 Yards. Riflescope is mounted 1.5&#8221; above the bore.[SIZE=3] [SIZE=2][B][FONT=arial]Use Extreme Caution - Know Your Backdrop - 22LR is Lethal.[/FONT][/B][/SIZE][/SIZE]\n \n[TABLE="align: left"]\n[TR]\n[TD]Distance[/TD]\n[TD]  Drop[/TD]\n[TD]Clicks[/TD]\n[TD]  MOA[/TD]\n[TD]M Rad[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2][B]      50[/B][/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2][B]    0[/B][/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    -[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    -[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]     -[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]      60[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -0.51[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]     3[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -0.81[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-0.24[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]      70[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -1.31[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]     7[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -1.79[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-0.52[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]      80[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -2.41[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   11[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -2.87[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-0.84[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]      90[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -3.81[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   16[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -4.05[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-1.18[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    100[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -5.58[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   21[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -5.33[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-1.55[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    125[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-11.42[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   35[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -8.72[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-2.54[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    150[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-19.53[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   50[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-12.44[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-3.62[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    175[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-30.02[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   66[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-16.38[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-4.76[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    200[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-43.11[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   82[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-20.58[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-5.99[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2][B]    100[/B][/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2][B]   0  [/B][/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]     -[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]     -[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]     -[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    125[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -4.45[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    14[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -3.40[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-0.99[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    150[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-11.17[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   28[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -7.11[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-2.07[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    175[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-22.26[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   44[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-11.06[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-3.20[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    200[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-31.95[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   61[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-15.26[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-4.44[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    250[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-63.72[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]   97[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-24.34[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-7.08[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][SIZE=2]    300[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]  -108[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2] 137[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-34.35[/SIZE][/TD]\n[TD][SIZE=2]-9.99[/SIZE][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[SIZE=2]\n\n\n \n[/SIZE][FONT=arial][SIZE=2]\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[B][FONT=verdana]\n\n[/FONT][/B][/SIZE]\n\n[/FONT]', ''),

Thanks[/U]\n\n\nNow what I learnt from this forum is that EZ9 is latest model of CZ999 ( I am not wrong)..so Ez9 is better than its old model CZ999, and CZ999 Scorpion, right? Kindly share some info on this... Also I think EZ or CZ both are steel/alloy fram rather than polymer, and in a thread dear 12 Guage (If I am not wrong) said that Steel/alloy frames need more maintenance than polymers, in other words, if not properly attended they may get "old" pretty soon. So what about this statement of his...\n\nAnd once Sir Denovo, while comparing the two (VIKING and CZ999 Scorpion) said that both are good guns, one is with decoker and other is with safety, so it mean CZ999 Scorpion comes with manual safety? Does EZ9 also comes with safety?\n\n\nNow, as per Sir Cancer Doc, Taurus is best option if I can increase the budget a little, since he got his in 67k recently...and if I didnt get it wrong, he said that taurus has both safety and decocker...! right? But, again what is the prospect of steel/alloy frame and maintenace hassel? and also what about taurus''s after market parts and Accessories???\n\nDont know much about Canik Piranha..., so I am unaware of its performance, durability etc...\n\n\nAnother question, is CZ Duty, has both decoker and safety? or any one of those?\n\n\nP.S. I have not ruled out any pistol yet, just narrowing down my preferencies... Secondly, it will be of much help if expeirenced and expert members, post current estimated prices of every gun they suggest and kindly also mention its suitablity in the light of "above mentioned characteristics".\n\nMany thanks to all fellow members once again.', ''),

Secondly i was thinking, these rifles are also gas operated and gas chamber is set on the gas pressure developed in long barrel, now if we cut down the barrel, it will disturb the pressure required to rechambeing the next round, sooner or later it will be affecting the gas chamber and ejector (because of extra carbon) might result in ftf...\nwell babaz bro i know the previous owner and seen him firing at range, without any ftf and fte, (cannot comment on accuracy) this thing is lil bit confusing...', ''),

(557095, ' I''ve noticed this at several local gun shops. The dealers have AR-15  carbines and M4A3''s right beside each other for around the same price  (m4 being about $75 more), both the same size, with flat top receivers  and mounted carry handle, both semi automatic, and chambered for .223. I  was under the impression that M4 riffles were for military and police  issue only, seeing as they were either full auto or three round burst.  So what''s the difference? Is one company just trying to trick me into  buying a more expensive version of the same gun?', ''),
(557096, ' [h=2]Best Answer - Chosen by Voters[/h]                               Today "AR-15"  is a common generic term for any semi-automatic rifle that is patterned  after the original AR-15 or any M16 or M4 variant.  Colt owns the AR-15  trademark, but no longer sells the model. Even though AR-15 is used in  common speech, no other company can legally refer to their gun as an  AR-15 due to Colts trademark.  So calling a gun an AR-15 only tells you  that it is semi-automatic and it looks and generally operates like the  guns it is patterned after.  It tells you nothing about the actual build  specs, quality, and detailed features for of the gun.\n\nOn the other hand an "M4" is a non-trademarked military designation,  so several companies refer to their civilian "AR-15" carbine models as  an M4 or some variant like the M4A3 (I am guessing it is a Bushmaster  you are looking at).  So calling a civilian ownable gun an M4 only tells  you that it is AR-15 carbine, which again tells you nothing about the  quality of the gun.  Do not confuse civilian M4s with the selective fire  Military Colt M4.   The "M4" you see police carrying may be a Military Colt M4, a  selective fire carbine that fits the M4 pattern from a different  manufacturer, or a semi-auto AR-15 carbine that a civilian can own.\n\nSo the short answer is without knowing the actual Manufacturer and Model  #, there is not enough information to tell the difference between the  two rifles.\n\nAs to the chamber, make sure that it is chamber in 5.56x45mm and not  .223.  I am sure that it probably is, but some very cheap models may not  support 5.56.  You can safely shoot .223 from a 5.56 chamber, but not  the other way around.  Because the term AR-15 is used so generically you  don''t know what you will get unless you check the specs.', ''),

(557180, ' [QUOTE=ajmal virk;377319]Hi dear fellows\nI spent my last week in Manila and some other parts of the Philippines also for technical visit to some waste water treatment plants being run in different parts of Philippines and this is some kind of new technology and we were in search of this technology for our textile export plant for Levi,s.Being a gun nut i could not control myself and i asked my host to arrange few visits to gunshops , he could only manage for the two of them so i went there and i thought i should share this with my beloved fellows on PG. I visited teo stores one was on some road i do not rembemer the name of the road but it was a factroy outlet of Shooter Arms Manufacturing (SAM) there brand name is SAM also and was managed my a women and second one was in a big departmental store named as Robinson like Metro or Makro here in Lahore.Before discussing these stores and posting the pics and awsome rates of different branded guns they told me i would like to share there gun laws and special role of private security guards etc.\nLicence in Philippines is difficult to get as in Pakistan these days they issue card licences only for 3 years and after that you have to get new card after every 3 years and fee is around 100USD for three years and if you want to carry you need separate permit that can b cancelled at any time due to some reasons like elections etc.Also not everyone is eligible for arms licence you have to prove to the authorities that you need a gun in true sense usually busnissmen \nand rich people who are really in need get licences.There are many private security agencies and they get licences of .38 special revolver,pumpaction or i only saw one Escort samiauto with a gaurd at the entrance of my hotel most of them have .38,wood rod and a handcuff too that was interesting that private guards having handcuffs but i was told that this is just show off,but i have seen these guys even controlling the traffic which i was told that it was also part of their duty somtimes.In my six days stay i only saw one police van equiped with M16 rifles and Glock17 pistols they usually do not come on the roads if they are not called.Most of people in some parts of the country keep illegal weapons even they guy who was assigend a driver to me have Smith&Wesson 9mm w/o licence so things are much like Pakistan.Now i will start with SAM i visited this shop on last Friday when i was there it was being managed by a women and girl [U][COLOR=#ff0000][B]women was around 36 and girl was around 22[/B][/COLOR][/U] .There total arsenal was few .45ACP 1911 pistols and few airguns in .22 calibre and very well build they shown me the pistol but not airguns because these were packed in PE packings.The women was not cooperating and then told her that i am also gun dealer back in Pakistan then she jumped in joy and called her boss in factory and he talked to me and offered me visit to my factory which i refused due to time shortage but took snaps of the 1911 in .45 ACP and airguns spare parts and bullets of .40 and .357 mangnum which i will b sharing shortly then i will tell u prices of Glock 17 and you will see the difference that how much we are being made fool by dealers in Pakistan.The price 1911 made by SAM was around 27000 Pesos and if we convert in Pak rupees it will be 64800 rupees.[/QUOTE]\n\nSo, how did you find out their age..? :)', ''),

The suggestions provided by Brother Abbas on behalf of PG community were reviewed and discussed at length. The concerns of the caracal owners, the unfortunate incidents which took place in Pakistan and the legal challenges which has previously delayed the recall process were discussed at length. After all the considerations and specially the views of PG members, following was concluded:\n\n\n1. Caracal will publish adds regarding recall announcements in two news papers ( Jang - Urdu, Dawn - English ) in all regional editions.\n\n\n2. All dealers will be contacted once again to remove Caracal C from their shelves immediately. The dealers will be provided with refund assurance of their available stock. \n\n\n3. Dealers will be instructed to contact end users and schedule the timeline for Caracal C owners to bring their pistols for refund and removal from their licenses. Caracal C owners will receive their refund on spot at  scheduled time.\n\n\n4. Special arrangements will be made to import the new generation grip frames of Caracal F and the replacement process will start within short time. Furthermore, Caracal stand firmly behind its model Caracal F and assures all Caracal F owners that after changing their current grip frame to new generation grip frame, the pistols will be safer than ever.\n\n\n5. Mr Hashmi and Mr K Khan will be contacted. Their grievances will be addressed to the best of their interests. \n\n\n6. Caracal value Pakistani market and will include Pakistan in their global marketing plan which will enable the company to support efforts for the promotion of safety and training.\n\n\nThis is to assure that everyone at Caracal and Royal emirates group is determined to implement all the above said on most priority basis. However, we hope that all of you will understand that most sincere desires still relies on the required working timelines need to be completed by humans. Therefore, we would require just a little patience from everyone and insha Allah, we will have this matter behind us very soon.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nDr Kaiser', ''),

Some match bullets (ie Sierra Match Kings) have a cavity at the tip, not to aid expansion, but to improve ballistic coefficient and weight balance which allows the bullet to carry more velocity down range and renders it less affected by crosswinds.\nThey do have a different recoil impulse than FMJ''s, also different bullets, or even just different brands, all different impact points. If you''re used to practicing with one type of ammo and then switch, that would cause your perception of inaccuracy, especially if the FMJs and HPs you were shooting were of different weights.', ''),

He ordered both cars to be searched and I told him that I have a weapon. They got the weapon from center console and I told him it is chambered. He was like why have u kept it chambered and I replied because it is a defensive weapon and needs to be chambered otherwise it is of little use in emergency. Anyway, I handed over the license and the 144 permit. They thoroughly checked everything. I even told him about the car situation and that it is not mine but he asked us again if we fired the shots. I told him to smell the barrel for gun powder and check the bullets. He counted bullets from both magazine. I had total 31 bullets. 15+1 and 15 so he was now convinced that we were not the culprits.

I''ve had a LONG discussion on this topic and participants were a senior police official, an army major and a lawyer (doesn''t get better than this!)\n\nby LAW if you''re transporting a gun in safe condition (which means it''s inside a box with slide locked back and magazines are kept separately) and out of reach, then it classifies as transporting and not carrying (which means having the gun on person or car within easy reach / access and magazine inside with bullets... etc)\n\nin case of safe transportation, you don''t need a carrying permit 144, however unless you have the power to influence the people stopping to check you on the streets, there''s not much that can be done if the LEAs decide that it is unlawful.\n\nSee the thing is, my police officer friend maintains that the way cops look at it, is that you can easily "transport" a weapon safely from point A to point B, put everything together and commit a criminal activity, and then transport it safely back... which is why they require full and valid documentation from you and do not differentiate between transporting and carrying.\n\nthe lawyer friend states that since it is written in law that you may transport safely, they have no right to apprehend you (but he also agrees with the police officer that unless you have power; you get stopped, you get screwed).\n\nParticularly in the current situation prevalent in Karachi for example, it would be safest not to take the risk.

It was a busy day and i left from office at 8 pm. I got on a bus for home and when we crossed bilawal roundabout towards ziauddin hospital clifton, three guys got up from their seats two went for both gates of bus and one with a shiny .32 bore revolver told the driver to drive slow an announced that " Look at this gun it has death in 5 chambers and in 1 life gives us your money and mobiles and if any one tries to a be hero i will shoot". One poor guy tried to escape and went bang on ladies compartment was hit with a TT''s butt by one guy at the gate. I vowed to myself that i won''t give them a dime and wished i was armed. As the the guy was busy collecting poor souls of their belongings i got up and said "Buddy what u want from poor and jobless person like me" as i completed my sentence i felt the cold barrel of .32 bore revolver on my head and looked into the BG''s eyes. He paused and then took off his chrome shiny local made revolver and said" Yar tum sai kon lai raha hai kuch ik taraf baith jao" "Buddy who is taking anything from u sit aside".

(557586, ' Thing is most modern well made pistols are accurate enough for SD/HD.  When we talk about competition level differences of say a 2 inch group and a 2 and half inch group at 25 yards (for example) then that is slow deliberate shooting. In an SD situation such differences don''t matter as such. Which is why these are essentially ''Combat weapons''.   \n\nMost of the time its not the gun that matters but the skill of the shooter and what best fits his hands as well.  The first time I shot a pistol at a target. It was the 917c. I could not hit a door at 25 feet!! \n\nOf course I blamed the gun. But the fact is it was my own in-experience. As years passed and my shooting experience grew I realised that it was not the gun that mattered but the hands that held it. \n\nAs I said before, at above 200 kms speeds the Farrari will probably perform better then the Porche. But the fact is that most people simply cannot drive well at above 200+ speeds. \n\nIn the end your hands themselves will tell u what they are most comfortable with.

I live in Mississauga, Canada. I own 1x .30 Bore & 1x .12 repeater in Pakistan, for SD. Both are dara made. I had both of my licenses made in 2008, and since then i only visited Pakistan a few times for short periods. I am planing to change them to more reliable imported weapons this time as i am traveling to Pakistan next week.\n \ni will later on ask for the opinions from the members here to help me choose the weapons. But for now, i just wanted to introduce myself. i am very pleased to have joined this forum and i hope i will learn alot from members in here.', ''),

I am an OK shot when it comes to 9mm. But last time on the range I tried hollow points on coke bottles from 10 yards. I found out that I am a horrible shot when it comes to 9mm hollow point. Could you tell the reason for this sudden decreased accuracy? This seriously made me reconsider using hollow point as my carry ammo. The guns I used were Glock 17 and CZp-07 DUTY. Any input will be appreciated.[/QUOTE]\n[/FONT]Actually,hollow points are generally accepted as being more accurate. Some match bullets (ie Sierra Match Kings) have a cavity at the tip, not to aid expansion, but to improve ballistic coefficient and weight balance which allows the bullet to carry more velocity down range and renders it less affected by crosswinds.\nThey do have a different recoil impulse than FMJ''s, also different bullets, or even just different brands, all different impact points. If you''re used to practicing with one type of ammo and then switch, that would cause your perception of inaccuracy, especially if the FMJs and HPs you were shooting were of different weights.[/quote]', ''),
