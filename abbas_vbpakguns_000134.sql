(100342, ' [b]The Excuses Culture: Why We Protect Ourselves With Excuses [/b]\n\nHe that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else. â Benjamin Franklin\nWhen was the last time you made a resolve to achieve something, set a deadline and then achieved it? Can you even remember the last time? Iâm struggling. And the reason I am struggling to remember such a time is because of excuses. I make them for everything; consciously and unconsciously. Without noticing it, excuses have become a habit that I am struggling to shake. \nIn this post I want to talk about the excuses culture that we have develop within ourselves and why we use excuses to protect ourselves from feelings of failure and fear. Hopefully it will spur some readers out there into action.\n\n[b]Why we make excuses[/b]\n\nA few years ago I was sitting in the car with a friend of mine having a conversation (argument) about how I always seem to find a way out of things. At the end of the debate he said something that has stayed at the front of my mind, something that I think about whenever I am feeling like making an excuse. He said:\nâYou have always found things easy. You are good at everything. But you arenât great at anything because you make excuses. You would rather be the âpotentialâ to be great than actually try and fail. And that is sad.â\nHe was right. All my life I have been naturally gifted at sport and academics. I didnât have to work hard to get good. But I never really excelled at anything. I never worked really hard to become great at a certain activity. Why? Because I was afraid of failure. I was afraid of trying and not getting there. \n\n[b]My parents role in this habit[/b]\n\nI never blame my parents for anything in my life. I simply do not feel like it is a productive exercise. But I can see how certain things they did impacted the way I turned out. And one of those things was how my mother always told me how amazing I could be. She would constantly tell me how smart I was, how good at soccer I was and how I could become something truly special. \nBut rather than spurring me on to excellence it seemed to do the opposite. I was comfortable being the potential for greatness. I was afraid to actually give it a shot for fear that I wasnât actually as smart, talented and athletic as she thought. So I made excuses. Excuses so I wouldnât have to try. \nAnd we all do it. All the time.\n\n[b]Fear: the reason for most excuses[/b]\n\nSo why do we make excuses? Why do we find ways to get out of things? Well, for the most part, it is because we are afraid. We are afraid of trying and we are afraid of failing. We are afraid of change and we will do anything to keep the norm functioning. Fear is the reason most of us make excuses. \nIf you look deep into your own mind and your own behavior you will see that you make excuses to protect your sense of self. We spend our whole lives developing and ego and decorating it with friends and family and money and success and we will do anything to protect our concept of that self. Even if it makes us depressed and unfulfilled. And ultimately that is what excuses do, they make you feel unfulfilled.\n\n[b]How to stop making excuses and move forward[/b]\n\nPeople say that the hardest thing you will ever do is quit smoking. But quitting excuses is 10 times harder. Excuses are the reason you started smoking, drinking and eating bad food. You make an excuse not to be healthy and an excuse not to be happy. Breaking the excuse culture is damn hard work. Here are some things you can do.\n\n[b]1. Realize that you do it all the time[/b]\n\nAs always, you need to take a look at yourself and really truly realize that you make mistakes. Find concrete examples of where you have sabotaged your progress by making an excuse and remember that incident. Bring it to mind whenever you feel like doing it again.\n\n[b]2. Look at your (lack of) progress[/b]\n\nTake a look at how much progress you have made with your meditation, athletics, mortgage repayments or family weekend time. See how many excuses you have made and how that has affected your progress is a very real way. Until you can see that it is doing damage you will have no real impetus to stop.\n\n[b]3. Realize that death is coming[/b]\n\nPeople always send me emails saying that I am too depressing when I talk about death. I always reply saying âit is depressing not to talk about itâ. For too long our species has made death a taboo subject when, in fact, it is the only thing in life that is certain. Understand that death is coming and that you have no time for excuses. Not any. Its too hot, too cold, too nice inside, Iâm too tired, I have a headacheâ¦ all of those sound like absolute bullshit when you are on your deathbed looking back at what you didnât achieve. \n\n[b]4. Realize you do it out of fear[/b]\n\nIf you go up to a fat man in the street and tell him that he is a coward he will probably punch you in the face. Men donât like to be considered afraid, but that is exactly what we are. We make excuses because we are afraid. Why, then, do we still do it? If someone told us that we were afraid of something else we would do everything in our power to change and prove that we are brave. Do that now with excuses. Prove that you are not afraid of failure, change or losing the norm.\n\n[b]5. Be different in five years time[/b]\n\nHow different are you now to five years ago? Are you more loving, compassionate, patient, strong, rich, happy, thin, etc.? Take a look at whatever goal you have in your life and see how much closer you are to it now than you were five years ago. If you can say you are happy with your progress then chances are you donât have a problem with excuses. If you are almost exactly the same then you can bet your right eye on the fact that you are stagnant because you are sabotaging your progress by saying âits too hardâ or âits too cold outsideâ. Be different in five years time and stop making excuses.\nDo you make excuses?\n\nI would love to know how many of my readers consider themselves to be excuse makers. What kind of excuses do you come up with and how (if at all) have you dealt with them? Have your excuses held you back from being all that you can be? And how have you felt the weight of this âpotentialâ slowing you down in life? Is it easier to not try?\n \nThe writeup has been taken from [url]http://www.thedailymind.com[/url].(A very good website for good Writing stuff)', ''),

As the 38 S&W is 358 in bullet dia wheras the 38 special is .357. The case dimensions are also different, the conversion would mean lengthening  of all six chambers without in any way changing the bore dia of the cylinders.

(100498, ' [quote=PsiFactor] \nBut sir  9mm is notorious for over-penetration.There are many stories over the Internet. [/quote]\n\nDear Friend,\n\nMy response, in gun-brother love is this.\n\nThe internet is a poor source of information and notoriety more often has little to do with fact.  The gun world lacks scientific study and lacks not for opinion.\n\nI would much rather investigate specific examples and review specific shootings than debate theory.  \n\nThere may be a reason for an opinon about or notoriety regarding a caliber, such as commonality.  The more common a round is, the more likely it is to have rumor and inuendo surrounding it.  9mm is very popular.  Lots of people carry it, and shoot it.  As a result lots of unqualified persons have opinions about it.  These unqualified persons lack the training and sometimes just the intelligence to correctly access their experience.  (This is a hypothetical person, not you)  Give a lot of poor shooters a 9mm and the consensus by these poor shooters is that the 9mm doesn''t do well at stopping threats.  Their opinion has the weight of multiple voices; but in reality it''s a bunch of individually bad shooters experiencing the results of their poor marksmanship and has nothing to do with the cartridge at all.  This weight of evidence is countered when a bunch of well trained shooters carry the same cartridge and for some reason manage to neutralize threats rather well.\n\n(Interestingly, a rare round experiences something similar- if only one person has experience with the cartridge, he is the only, "expert" on the cartridge, and people will believe his statements, no matter how incorrect the person''s assesments about the cartridge are.)\n\nLet''s consider gun-goober "George."  George carries a 9mm and reads a lot on gun forums and watches a lot of action movies.  George is also not very smart or introspective.  George is faced with an unfortunate situation and has to shoot someone.  The person does not immediately fly off his feet and half-explode in a spray of crimson like in the movies.  George deduces incorrectly that the 9mm is a poor man stopper.  Or, George learns that the bullet passed through the person.  He does not know how fast the bullet was going when the round exited his attacker.  But he presumes the bullet over-penetrated.  George tells everyone that the 9mm over penetrates and is not reliable for self-defense.  Those people lack any contradictory evidence and assume that George is correct, and notoriety is born.  George posts his experience to a gun forum and spreads his opinion.\n\nThe problem is that his experience is not scientific.  A proper look at his shooting could tell a radically different story.  It could turn out that George should have been practicing more shooting than typing.  Instead of a good center mass hit to the upper chest, George shot the guy through only about 4" of skin and fat, not 14" of skin, muscle, bone, and organs.  The reason for the "over-penetration" is poor shot placement.\n\nOr, it could turn out that the shot did go through the chest, striking muscle, bone and organs and did pop out the attacker''s back- put at only about 100 fps.  The bullet quickly dropped to the ground and caused no injury.  I would not call this over-penetration.  I''d call this about right.  It actually takes a really well placed shot to instantly incapacitate an attacker.  So a shot through the chest and lung and out the back may not drop him right there.  But neither did the round over-penetrate.\n\nThere are some physics (I am not trained in physics) which could lead to 9mm being believe to be more likely to over-penetrate and the world being as it is, the oft repeated "possibility" has become the "reality."  A lighter bullet is more likely to be deflected, therefor it "could" skip off a bone that a heavier bulelt  my break through.  A fast bullet with small cross-section (like the 9mm) would arguable be more likely to miss bone and zip through someone.  This is logical, but if not present in reality it is simply an argument.  This argument is read by someone, repeated in writing elsewhere, read again, repeated again, and ultimately becomes an [u]accepted fact [/u]instead of a [u][b]demonstrated event.[/b][/u]\n\nI say again,  I have not yet encountered a validated event where a properly placed shot with a handgun round passed through a person and retained enough energy to seriously injure or kill a second person.  I know of bad shot placement and misses which did so.\n\n\n[quote]BTW which ammo will you recommend for self defence in 9mm. [/quote]\nThe list is long... but don''t put your trust in a bullet.  [u][b]Instead put your trust in lots and lots of practice[/b][/u].  \n\nIf you can''t shoot, dry fire.\n\nA partial list:\nFederal Hydra-shock\nHornady TAP\nWinchester Personal Defense\nSpeer Gold Dot\nGolden Saber\nCor Bon\n\non and on.\n\nAny well made commercial hollow point, as long as it shoots well through your gun should suffice.', ''),

You must be right and pointing to the same group of facts as I did but below is how I understand;\n\n[quote=12gauge]\nthe assembler job merely is to center/Zero the sights to the point of (bullet) impact[/quote]\nZeroing or sight caliberation is not achieved in partially adjustable sights of pistols. They are meant in fully adjustable sights. I hope anyone would agree. Partially adjustable sights are only horizontally adjustable(Drift adjustments) or replaced/altered in case a vertical adjustment is required. Sights however in a factory are aligned. This alignment is physically proportionate placement of sights with respect to barrel locked in battery with the slide. \n\n[quote=12gauge]\nBro, what are you talking about? dovetailed and provided with "allen screw" for adjusting :lol:  then why is there a dovetail in there ? ;) allen screw basically provides the tension to the sights so that they stay in place inside the dovetail. it does not adjust the sights. that you must do with a proper sight pusher. (HINT: drift adjustable)[/quote]\nYou put it very right about drift adjustments in dovetailed sights and hope its clear to all. The Allen screw provided with good sights such as NOVAK 3-dot are meant to get these easily adjusted horizontally by letting it loose if the scew is unwinded. I checked it on a Taurus 809 and it has novaks. I have the right key for the screw on the rear sight but still have to visit market to get the right size key for front sight adjustment(Drift I must say). Friends who have dovetailed sights on their pistols without the screws can get it done by a gunsmith who will have brass punch. Dont even go in th hastle of doing yourself. \n\n[quote=12gauge]\ncustomization should only be voluntary, not mandatory.[/quote]\nYeah bro there is always an option for improvisation.

(100529, ' [quote=Skeeter60]Re making firing pins voids the warranty of any gun.\nIt has become popular to have a slightly longer firing pin as it helped in preventing misfires[/quote]\nVery rightly said as I myself have experienced an accidental discharge during the slide release of a TT. The firing pin was made longer than normal as I knew it already my friend had informed me of this. I examined the pistol later to find out that return spring of firing pin was getting stuck or was bent with gunk in the channel which was not letting the pin retract once it was pushed manually using a key.\nAnyway, if a firing pin is to be re-made, the good gun smith will take care of the pins correct dimension and angles to fit the firing pin channel and pin block. He will do the milling correctly to conform with this. He will never make a longer firing pin I guess as it is no solution to the problem. \nFiring pin issues in local guns revolve around scrap metal pins in low cost TTs(which are mostly used in our society), loosened pin(light primer stike off and on)due to improper milling to fit in the channel and shorter than required length in firingpins found even in 20k + clones.', ''),

(100629, ' A Nuskha:\n\n- - - - - -\n\n[b]60 WAYS TO KEEP THE LOVE OF YOUR WIFE. GAURANTEED! [/b]\n \n \n1.Make her feel secure; (sakina- tranquillity) QUIT BEING AGGRESSIVE\n\n\n2. When you go home say ''Assalmualikum. ''  (Greetings) It kicks the shaitaan out of your home!\n\n3. Prophet (saw) described the wife as a fragile vessel and said to take care of this vessel thatâs fragile. Remember that there is goodness in this vessel so treat it gently.\n\n4. When you advise her, do so in privacy, in a peaceful environment. NOT IN PUBLIC as itâs a type of slandering.\n\n5. Be generous to your wife- it keeps her LOVED\n\n6. Move and let her have your seat. It will warm her heart.\n\n7. AVIOD ANGER. HOW? Keep your wudu at all times. Prophet saw said if your angry, sit down, if youâre sitting, then lie down. Follow the sunnah!\n\n8. Look good and smell great for your wife. IT keeps the LOVE! \n\n9. Donât be rigid. It will break you. Prophet Mohammed - Sallal lahu Aleihi Wasallam (SAW means âMay the blessings and the peace of Allah be upon himâ (Muhammad).) said ''I am the best amongst you and I am the best to my wife''. Being rigid and harsh will not bring you close to Allah and neither does it make you more of a man.\n\n10. Listen to your wife-BE a GOOD LISTENER\n\n11. YES to flattering NO to arguing. Arguing is like poison in a marriage. Al zawai said ''When Allah (swt) wants evil for people He will leave them to argue amongst themselves''.\n\n12. Prophet (saw) said to call your wives with the best name, any name she loves to hear. Prophet Mohammed (saw) called Aisha ''ya Aish'' as an endearment. \n\n13. Give her a pleasant surprise. I.e. if she loves watermelon, bring her one out of the blue. It will grow the love in her heart.\n\n14. Preserve your tongue! Prophet (saw) said the tongue will throw people in the hell fire so watch what you say and how you say it!\n\n15. All of us have shortcoming. Accept her shortcoming and Allah (swt) will put barakh in your marriage.\n\n16. TELL her you appreciate her. SHOW her you appreciate her. \n\n17. Encourage her to keep good relation with her relative, her mum and dad etc.\n\n18. Speak with her with a topic of HER interest.\n\n19. In front of her relative praise her. Confirm/ realise that she is wonderful, and that she is a good person in front of her family.\n\n20. Give each other gifts. You will love each other more. Prophet (saw) said gifts increases love.\n\n21. Get rid of the routine once in a while, surprise her with something, it will get rid of the rust and polish it!\n\n22. Husnul zaan- We have a demand from Allah (swt) that we have to think good of people. Think good of your spouse.\n\n23. Ignore some of her mistakes- pretend you did not see/hear some of her small mistakes. It was a practise of Ali (RA). Itâs like putting a hole in your memory. Donât save it in your memory!\n\n24. Increase the drops of patience, especially when she is pregnant or when she is on her monthly period.\n\n25. Expect and respect her jealousy. Even Aisha (ra) used to get jealous.\n\n26. Be humble. If your profession is good, respect that she is looking after your children, she is much more than you, she is the leader at home, her strength is your strength, and her success is your successes.\n\n27. Don''t put your friends above your wife.\n\n28. Help your wife at home. Prophet (saw) used to help his wives at home and he was the best of creation. He used to sew his own clothes. \n\n29. Help her respect your parents, you canât force her to love them, but she can be helped to gradually love them.\n\n30. Show your wife she is the ideal wife. \n\n31. Remember your wife in your duaas. It will increase the love and protect it.\n\n32. Leave the past. It brings nothing but pain and grief. Itâs not your business. The past is for Allah (swt).\n\n33. Don''t try to show her that you are doing her a favour by doing something, like buying food for the house, because in reality we are the courier of sustenance, not the providers, as Allah is the provider. Itâs also a way of being humble and thankful to Allah (swt)\n\n34. Shaitaan is your enemy, not your wife. Sometime when husband and wife are talking a fight breaks out, then shaitaan is present there as a third person so he is the real enemy. It is not enough to hate the shaitaan, but you have to see him as an enemy as Allah has commanded. Shaitaan loves divorce. HE comes everyday and sits office and asks the devils what they have done, some say i have made a person steal, or i have made someone drink etc. And one devil will say i have made a man divorce his wife, and he is crowned as the one who has done the best job. \n\n35. Take the food and put it in her mouth. Prophet (saw) taught us this. Itâs a blessing. The food doesnât just go to her stomach, but straight to her heart. It increases the love and mercy between you.\n\n36. Protect your wife from the evil of the shaitaan and mankind. She is like a precious pearl that needs protecting from the envy of human devils and shitaan.\n\n37. Show her your smile. Smile at your wife. ITâS A CHARITY. \n\n38. Small problems/ challenges can become a big problem. Or if there is small thing she didn''t like and you keep repeating them anyway, it will create a wall between you. Donât ignore them as it can become big.\n\n39. Avoid being harsh hearted and moody. Allah said of prophet (saw) ''if you were harsh hearted they (the companions) would have left you.'' It confirms prophet (saw) was not harsh hearted, so GET RID OF IT.\n\n40. Respect her thinking. Itâs strength for you. Show you like her thoughts and suggestions.\n\n41. Help her to achieve her potential and help her to dig and find success within as her success is your success. \n\n42. Respect the intimate relationship and its boundaries. Prophet (saw) said she is like a fragile vessel and she needs to be treated tenderly. Sometime she may not be feeling well; you must respect and appreciate that feeling. \n\n43. Help her to take care of the children. Some men think it makes them appear less of a man but in fact it makes you appear a bigger man and more respected, especially in the sight of Allah (swt). \n\n44. Use the gifts of the tongue and sweet talk her. Tell her she looks great, be an artist. Pick and choose gifts of the tongue.\n\n45. Sit down and eat with her and share food with her.\n\n46. Let her know you are travelling. Don''t tell her out of the blue as itâs against Islam. Tell her the date/ time of when you are coming back also.\n\n47. Don''t leave the house as soon as trouble brews. \n\n48. The house has privacy and secrecy. Once you take this privacy and secrecy to your friends and family you are in danger of putting a serious hole in your marriage. This secrecy stays home. Islam is against leaving them out like a garage sale for anyone to come and pick and choose.\n\n49. Encourage each other for ibadah, i.e. plan a trip for hajj or umrah together. It increases and strengthens the love when you help each other perform a good deeds together i.e, do tahajuud together,or  go to a dars together etc.\n\n50. Know her rights, not only written in paper but engraved in your heart and engraved in your conscious.\n\n51. Allah( swt) said ''live with your wives in kindness.'' Treat them with kindness and goodness. It means in happy times and in sadness treat her with goodness and fairness. \n\n52. Prophet (saw) showed that at the time of intimacy. Donât jump on your wife like an animal!\n\n53.  When you have a dispute with your wife donât tell everyone. Itâs like leaving your wounds open to germs so be careful who you share your problems and disputes with.\n\n54.  Show your wife you really care for her health. Good health of your wife is your good health. To care for her health shows her that you love her.\n\n55. Donât think you are always right. No matter how good you are you have shortcomings. You are not perfect as the only one who was perfect in character was prophet (saw). Get rid of this disease.\n\n56. Share your problems, your happiness, and your sadness with her.\n\n57. Have mercy on her weakness.  Have mercy when she is weak or strong as she is the fragile vessel. Prophet (saw) said that your wife is a trust in your hand.\n\n58. Remember you are her strength, someone to lean on in times of hardship. \n\n59. Accept her as she is. Prophet (saw) said that women are created from the rib which is bent. If you try to straighten her you will break her (divorce). Prophet (saw) said that you may dislike one habit in her but you will like another manner in her so accept her as she is.\n\n60. Have good intention for your wife all the time, Allah monitors your intention and your heart at all times. Allah (s.w.t) said Among His Signs is that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.  \n\n[b]May Allah fill our homes and heart with tranquillity, love and Mercy.  AMEEN[/b]', ''),

(100638, ' [quote]Yes HJ sahib, since last month and a half I am shooting with my left hand [/quote]\n\nGilani sahib basically you shoot excellent groups but few odd flyers at almost every target spoil the score. When i tried to see any consistency in these odd looking flyers... that was there. More than 80% these shots either go toward the right( 3 O,clock region) or up (12 O,clock region). Now rightward going shots most probably are due to triggering finger pushing the gun right while pulling the trigger. Although, most of the time you are in control being an experienced shooter but there are odd less focussed shots. For up going shots there is wrist break. For wrist break remedy try to hold gun with stronger grip by the middle two fingers( fingers between the triggering finger and the little finger). Stronger grip with middle fingers and bit less pressure with the little finger locks the wrist rock solid. \n\nNow coming to the last part, please shoot on a rapid fire target while shooting at 25M.

[b]WHY ITS ALWAYS THE MAN WHO HAS TO CLEAN THE SH*T[/b]  :(\n\nand what about the other NUSKHA describing man & wife being two wheels of same vehicle????[/quote]\n\nHere''s the ''other'' Nuskha;)\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]60 ways to keep the love of your HUSBAND guaranteed[/b]\n\n1. Behave like a female, i.e. all the tenderness of a female--a man doesnât want a man for his wife! \n\n2. Dress pleasantly/attractively. If you are a home-maker, donât stay in your sleeping suit all day. \n\n3. Smell good! \n\n4. Donât lay out all your problems on your husband as soon as he walks in. Give him a little mental break. \n\n5. Donât keep asking him, âwhat are you thinking?â \n\n6. Stop nagging non-stop before Allah taâala gives you something really to complain about. \n\n7. Absolutely no talking about your spousal problems to anyone you meet, not even under the pretense of seeking help! If you think you want to solve legitimate marital issues, then go seek counseling with the right person who can give advice in either: \n\na. Mediate any injustice done so any wrong can be corrected and the couple can reunite in harmony, or \n\nb. Amicable divorce \n\n8. Be kind to your mother-in-law the same way you would like your husband to be kind to your own mother. \n\n9. Learn all the rights and obligations of each other in Islam. Focus on fulfilling your obligations, not demanding your rights \n\n10. Race to the door when he comes home, as if you were waiting for him. Smile and hug him. \n\n11. Keep your house clean, at least to the level that he wants it. \n\n12. Compliment him on the things you know heâs not so confident about (looks, intelligence, etc.) This will build his self-esteem. \n\n13. Tell him heâs the best husband in the whole world. \n\n14. Call his family often. \n\n15. Give him a simple task to do at home and then thank him when he does it. This will encourage him to do more. \n\n16. When heâs talking about something boring, listen and nod your head. Even ask questions to make it seem like youâre interested. \n\n17. Encourage him to do good deeds. \n\n18. If heâs in a bad mood, give him some space. Heâll get over it, inshaAllah. \n\n19. Thank him sincerely for providing you with food and shelter. Itâs a big deal. \n\n20. If heâs angry with you and starts yelling, let him yell it out while youâre quiet. You will see your fight will end a lot faster. Then when heâs calm, you can tell him your side of the story and how you want him to change something. \n\n21. When youâre mad at him, donât say âYOU make me furiousâ, rather, âThis action makes me upsetâ. Direct your anger to the action and circumstance rather than at him. \n\n22. Remember that your husband has feelings, so take them into consideration. \n\n23. Let him chill with his friends without guilt, especially if theyâre good guys. Encourage him to go out, so he doesnât feel âcooped upâ at home. \n\n24. If your husband is annoyed over a little thing you do (and you can control it), then stop doing it. Really. \n\n25. Learn how to tell him what you expect without him having to guess all the time. Learn to communicate your feelings. \n\n26. Donât get mad over small things. Itâs not worth it. \n\n27. Make jokes. If youâre not naturally funny, go on the internet and read some jokes, and then tell them to him. \n\n28. Tell him youâre the best wife ever and compliment yourself on certain things you know youâre good at. \n\n29. Learn to make his favorite dish. \n\n30. Donât ever, EVER talk bad about him with friends or family unnecessarily. If they end up agreeing with you, you will see that it hits you back in the face because you get more depressed that you have a bad husband--and other people also think you have a bad husband. \n\n31. Use your time wisely and get things accomplished. If youâre a home-maker, take online classes and get active in your community. This will make you happy and a secondary bonus is that it impresses your husband. \n\n32. Do all of the above fee sabeelillah and you will see Allah put barakah in everything you do. \n\n33. Husband and wife should discuss and communicate with wisdom with each other to convey what they like and dislike of each other to do or not to do. Do NOT give commands or instructions like he''s your servant. âThey are garment to each otherâ [Surah Baqarah, 2:187] \n\n34. Tell your husband you love him, many, many times. Aisha (?????? ????) narrated that the Prophet (??? ???? ???? ????) used to ask her how strong her love for him, she said like âa knot.â And the next time he would ask her, âHow is that knot?â He also used to reply to her saying, âJazzakillah, O Aishah, wallahi, you have not rejoiced in me as I have rejoiced in you.â \n\n35. Have a race with your husband and let him win, even if you are much fitter and stronger than him. \n\n36. Keep fit and take care of your health so you will remain a strong mother, wife, cook and housekeeper, inshaAllah you will not get FAT and frumpy. \n\n37. Refine and cultivate good mannerisms i.e do not whine, donât laugh or talk too loud or walk like an elephant. \n\n38. Do not leave the house without his permission and certainly not without his knowledge. \n\n39. Make sure all his clothes are clean and pressed so he is always looking fresh and crisp. \n\n40. Donât discuss important/controversial matters with him when he is tired or sleepy. Find right time for right discussion. \n\n41. The way to a manâs heart is through his stomach. \n\n42. Always let him know that you appreciate him working and bringing home the "dough". It makes it easier for him to go to work. \n\n43. Make sure you ALWAYS have something for dinner. \n\n44. Brush your hair, everyday. \n\n45. Donât forget to do laundry. \n\n46. Surprise him with gifts. Even necessities, such as new shoes, can be gifts. \n\n47. Listen to him. (Even when he talks about extremely boring things like basketball or computers.) \n\n48. Try (hard as it might be) to take interest in his hobbies. \n\n49. Try not to go shopping too much ... and spend all his money. \n\n50. Look attractive and be seductive towards him. Flirt with him. \n\n51. Learn tricks and âtechniquesâ to please your husband in intimacy. (Of course goes both ways.) \n\n52. Prepare for special evenings with him with special dinner and exclusive time (no children permitted). \n\n53. Take care of your skin, especially your face. The face is center of attraction. \n\n54. If you not satisfied intimately, talk to him and tell him. Help him or provide resources, donât wait until matters become worse. \n\n55. Ask Allah to strengthen and preserve the bonds of compassion and love between the two of you, every day, every prayer. Ask him to protect that bond from Shaytaan. When a lesser devil destroys the love between spouses, he is the most beloved of Shaytaan. Nothing works like duâah, and love only exists between spouses where Allah instills it. \n56. Don''t EVER compare your husbands to other husbands! For example don''t say, "well her husband doesn''t do that, why do you ..." (thats a killer!) \n\n57. Be happy with what you have because no one is perfect. If you want perfection, wait until you enter Jannah together inshaAllah--and of course, vice versa! \n\n58. Strive for Allah''s love first and foremost! if all wives try to seek Allah''s love and pleasure, surely, they can keep their husbands love too. And remember--if Allah loves you, the angels will love you, and the entire creation will love you. \n\n59. If you pack a lunch for your husband to take to work, from time to time sneak in a little love note or sweet poem. If he doesn''t take a lunch, leave the note somewhere else for him to find, like in his briefcase, or wallet or on the car steering-wheel \n\n60. Wake him up for Qiyam ul-Layl (in the last third of the night) and ask him to pray with you. \n\n[b]May Allah preserve all of our marriages and help us understand and implement them in and with the best of manners, ameen![/b]', ''),

Most of the points SA has presented are simple chivalrous acts.

The steering wheels of this is with the Mrs. At the same time, there are certain other areas such a ''bringing the dough'' one, here the Man is the Steering Wheel.\n\nSo I guess the lead roles change according to the area of responsibility. Haan, what is important is that the areas of responsibility should be very clear between the two so as to avoid conflict.\n\nThese things help most of the times but seeking Allah SubhanuaTa''ala''s guidance and assistance along with these acts of chivalry will ensure a healthy relationship ALL THE TIME.

I am in fact facing problems in griping the handgun since the day I changed my shooting hand. Now, I am holding the pistol grip with my weaker hand and putting my stronger hand over it. It has its problems and I always feel that my grip is no more that solid as it used to be with right hand. But I will now particularly focus on this. Secondly, pushing with the firing finger may be the issue. I think it will take some time for the left hand firing finger to develop the right muscles because I can clearly feel that the same finger on my right hand is much more powerful (well developed muscles after more than two decades of casual shooting :) )\n\nAs regards the score calculation, you are absolutely right. I am shooting on a precision target and if I just convert the same score to a rapid fire target, 179 becomes 193 and 172 becomes 192.

(100794, ' [url]http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&ID=3893&CATE=107[/url]\n\n [b]Below are the basic principles of permissibility and impermissibility in the Hanafi School with regards to animal consumption, as mentioned in the classical books of Hanafi jurisprudence. (Culled from: al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, 5/289-291, Bada?i al-Sana?i, 5/35-39 and Radd al-Muhtar, 304-308)[/b]\n\n   1. Animals that have been clearly and explicitly prohibited in the Qur?an or Sunnah are without doubt Haram, such as a swine, donkey, etc.\n       \n   2. Animals that are born and live in water are all Haram with the exception of fish. All types of fishes are Halal, with the exception of that which dies naturally in the sea without any external cause. However, if a fish was to die due to some external cause such as cold, heat, being thrown to the shore by the water, colliding with a stone, etc, then it would be Halal.\n\n      Allah Most High says:\n\n          ?Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine?..? (Surah al-Ma?idah, V: 53)\n\n      In the above verse, Allah Almighty forbade the meat of all dead animals without differentiating between sea-animals and land-animals. Thus, all sea-animals would also be included in this general prohibition. However, fish has been exempted from this general ruling due to the explicit mention of its permissibility by the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace).\n\n      Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him eternal peace) said: ?Two types of dead meat and two types of blood have been made lawful for our consumption: The two dead meats are: fish and locust, and the two types of blood are: liver and spleen.? (Sunan Abu Dawud, Musnad Ahmad and Sunan Ibn Majah)\n\n      Moreover, there is no mention in the Sunnah literature that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) or his Companions (Allah be pleased with them all) ever consumed the meat of a sea-animal besides the fish, hence if it was permitted, it would have at least been consumed once in order to show its permissibility. (Dars Tirmidhi, 1/280)\n\n      As far as the fish which dies naturally in the sea without an external cause (samak al-tafi) is concerned, Sayyiduna Jabir ibn Abd Allah (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) said: ?What the sea throws up and is left by the tide you may eat, but what dies in the sea and floats you must not eat.? (Sunan Abu Dawud, no: 3809 & Sunan Ibn Majah)\n\n      Sayyiduna Ali (Allah be pleased with him) forbade the selling of naturally dead fish (floating fish) in the markets. (Bada?i al-Sana?i, 5/36 and al-Ikhtiyar)\n\n      In light of the above, all sea-animals are Haram except for fish. It will be permitted to eat a fish even without slaughtering it according to the rules of Shariah. However, a fish that dies naturally without an external cause and begins to float on the surface of the water (Samak al-Tafi) is also considered Haram.\n       \n   3. The third principle is that, amongst the land-animals, those that have no blood in them are considered Haram, such as a hornet, fly, spider, beetle, scorpion, ant, etc.\n\n      Allah Most High says:\n\n          ??for he (the Prophet) commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure)?? (Surah al-A?raf, V: 157)\n\n      Thus, animals that don?t contain blood such as spiders and others are considered to be from ?what is impure? because a sound natured person would detest their consumption.\n\n      The only exception is that of a locust, for the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) clearly permitted its consumption, in the Hadith of Sunan Abu Dawud and Musnad Ahmad quoted earlier.\n\n      Similarly, Ibn Abi Awfa (Allah be pleased with him) was asked concerning the consuming of a locust and he said: ?I fought with the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) in six or seven battles, and we used to eat it (locust) with him. ? (Sunan Abu Dawud, no: 3806)\n       \n   4. The forth principle is that those land-animals who have blood in them but the blood does not flow, in other words animals that do not have flowing blood, are also considered Haram, such as a snake, lizard, chameleon, etc.\n       \n   5. The fifth principle is that all types of pests (hasharat al-Ardh) are also considered Haram, such as a mouse, hedgehog, jerboa, etc.\n\n      The reasoning behind the prohibition of these animals is the same verse of Surah al-A?raf quoted above, in that they are considered impure (khabith) for consumption.\n       \n   6. The sixth principle is, land-animals who have flowing blood in them and they survive on grass and leaves, and do not prey on other animals (i.e. non-predatory terrestrial animals) are all considered Halal, such as a camel, cow, goat, buffalo, sheep, deer, etc, although there is a slight difference of opinion within the Hanafi School with regards to the consumption of horse-meat, as will be discussed later. Also, a donkey is exempted from this general ruling, in that its meat in considered Haram for consumption.\n\n      Allah Most High says:\n\n          ?And cattle (an?am), He has created for you, from them you derive warmth, and numerous benefits, and of their (meat) you eat.? (Surah al-Nahl, V: 5)\n\n      And:\n\n          ?It is Allah Who made cattle for you, that you may use some for riding and some for food.? (Surah al-Mu?min, V: 79)\n\n      In the above two verses, Allah Most High uses the term ?al-An?am? (cattle) which refers to non-predatory animals, according to the unanimous agreement of all the linguistics.\n\n      As far as the consumption of horse-meat is concerned, Imam Abu Hanifa (Allah have mercy on him) considers is somewhat disliked (makruh tanzihan) due to its honour and due to the fact that a horse is needed in Jihad. Imam Abu Yusuf and Imam Muhammad (Allah have mercy on them both) consider it Halal, and it is said that Imam Abu Hanifa also retreated to this opinion. Thus, it would be permitted to consume horse-meat, although better to avoid.\n\n      With regards to the meat of a donkey and mule, Allah Most High says:\n\n          ?And (He has created) horses, mules, and donkeys, for you to ride and use for show; and He has created (other) things of which you have no knowledge.? (Surah al-Nahl, V: 8)\n\n      So, in regards to all other non-predatory animals, Allah Almighty mentions that He has created them for consumption (as we have seen in the verses mention earlier). However, with regards to donkeys and mules, He mentions that they are for riding and adornment (zeenah). Had consumption of these animals been Halal, Allah Almighty would surely have mentioned it.\n\n      Moreover, Sayyiduna Abd Allah ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) forbade the meat of donkeys on the day of the battle of Khaybar.? (Sahih al-Bukhari, no: 5202)\n\n      Sayyiduna Abu Tha?laba (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) prohibited the eating of donkey?s meat. (Sahih al-Bukhari, no: 5205)\n\n      Sayyiduna Anas ibn Malik (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that a person came to the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) and said: ?The donkeys have been (slaughtered and) eaten.? Another man came and said: ?The donkeys have been destroyed.? The Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) ordered a caller to announce to the people: ?Allah and His Messenger forbid you to eat the meat of donkeys, for it is impure.? Thus the pots were turned upside down while the (donkey?s) meat was boiling in them.? (Sahih al-Bukhari, no: 5208)\n\n      With regards to the mules, Sayyiduna Khalid ibn al-Walid (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) forbade the meat of horses, mules and donkeys.? (Musnad Ahmad, 4/89, Sunan Abu Dawud, no: 3790, Sunan Nasa?i and Sunan Ibn Majah)\n\n      However, the fuqaha mention that the ruling on a mule would be that of its mother. If the mother is a donkey, then it would be definitely Haram. If the mother is some Halal animal such as a cow, it would be completely Halal, and if the mother is a horse, then the rules of eating horse-meat would apply.', ''),

He charges the normal market price for items which are available every where, however, for items (variants) which only he has in his inventory, he charges some premium;\n\n- Most other dealers pick up stuff from their shop to sell it to their customers by adding their own margins of 2k to 5k. Even Pioneer''s Adeel brought the 145 piece from Al-Haris to show it to me and so did Badar Arms;\n\n- Keeping in view that one expects to earn a return on his investment and since he is holding on to exclusive items at his own cost as compared to other dealers, who simply go and bring those exclusive items from him (and few other dealers incl Tayabally), he (Haris) is in his right to charge a reasonable return on his investment. Take my example: I was looking for a two tone PT145. Almost every dealer was able to arrange an all black one in 62k, but no one had the two tone one. The two dealers (Pioneer and Badar) who could arrange it for me were asking 70k. I overheard that one of them was getting it from Al-Haris, so I went straight to him. There, after some negotiation I got it for 65k.\n\n- He was courteous in his dealing throughout the time I was there and so was his other staff. Brought down Armscor .45 rounds price to 80 which others were quoting at 100. \n\n- I didn''t like the first piece brought out for me (because of some marks due to repeated slide racking). He saw my expression and had another fresh piece brought out for me immediately. He told me of other options too in this size. He seemed to be well informed and updated regarding different product variants and their specs. We even discussed H&Ks lawsuit against German Sports Goods resulting in production discontinuation of GSG-5.\n\n[b]And then we discussed PakGuns[/b] :lol:\n\nWith a painful expression on his face, he told me he knew what Pakguns members thought about him and his establishment, (i.e., being over-expensive and rude attitude) however, he patiently tried to explain the above-mentioned return on investment point. He kept emphasizing that his customers have the peace of mind of getting only genuine products without any sort of do-numberi either in arms or in ammo. He also mentioned that only two / three dealers (including himself) have huge investment in their inventory and that on daily basis, a few hundred items of their (his, Tayabally''s, etc) inventory circulates in the market because other dealers come and pick them up to show it to their customers and return it at the end of the day. \n\nIn the end he asked me to come back in case of any problem and he''s there for after sales support, if needed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn a concluding note:\n\n- Karachi market prices are 15% - 20% higher than Lahore''s, be it for arms or ammo. Why? Haven''t been able to figure that out yet.\n\n- Within Karachi, if one wants to have peace of mind of getting genuine imported products AND if s/he is willing to pay around 5% extra for that peace, then there are a handful of dealers which one should touch, and Al-Haris, Tayabally, Elahi Bux and Pioneer are among such dealers. This is based on my personal experience and others may feel free to disagree with me.\n\nI give this dealer a 7.5 out of 10 (similar to what I would give Tayabally).[/quote]\n\nRTTR (Real Treat to Read)\n\nSA/AT, I love the fact that you are objective, non-judgemental, and describe the people by they way that they treat you.

I am of the view that if we (PG members) start procuring from authentic (aik number) dealers such as AHT, Tayabally, Pioneer and Elahi Bux (who have their own inventory) on a more regular basis PLUS make them aware of the community which PG represents and the fact that PG members share their experiences with each other, we will Inshallah see a BIG change in the way these dealers deal with us.

This design was chosen among the other designs proposed by Baryshev, Rakov, Voevodin and Simonov for the Soviet Army.\n\nOne another thing reagarding the 9x18 bullet is that all the bullets labelling 9x18 are not compatible for Maks. eg, 9x18 Ultra pistol by Germany has the chamber diameter of [b]9.02 mm and Mak extends upto 9.2mm.[/b]', ''),

All my previous posts showed precision shooting targets and recent scores were between 170-180.

Among others, I have owned three Diana airguns so far, Mod. 48, 54 & 35 and still have two of them in use. Meanwhile I have used various brands available here and different types of mechanisms and pellets from plastic to solid copper & steel balls.\n\nMy limited exposure to these types have made PCPs to be my favorite for pure shooting pleasure without noise & vibration and with quickest repeating shots. The downside is their reliability and availability of seals & technical expertise. These rifles are not designed to be rugged & need extra special care while in use. These are priced among the best spring loading air rifles. Its great fun if someone owns it and you get a chance to shoot it ;-)\n\nThe reasons why I ended up always buying Diana springers even though I like PCPs are their reliability, quality & performance that are second to none.\n\nI have used 2 Shadow 1000s. One purchased from Al Sayad & other from Neela Gumbad but found it to be almost half in effective range as compared to the three Dianas I have used.

One has to [b]understand[/b] that [b]you canât get the same accuracy level form different barrel length handguns at certain distant target.[/b]\n\nEach different barrel length handgun will accomplish different accuracy level on a target [b]distant at 25 Meters and 15 Meters.[/b] If we are talking about 25 Meter distant target than we need to compare the gun which has certain characteristics, meant for target shooting. [b]We canât compare any gun primarily meant for self-defense [/b]and with a barrel length of less than 4 inches. Though we use most the time our self-defense handguns for target shooting which is fine but to judge a handgunâs accuracy by brand itâs not justified. We need to compare the accuracy of different handguns based on their purpose that they were built.\n\n[b]Compact and sub-compact [/b]handguns are made for [b]close range self-defense [/b]not for long range (25 or 20 meters) [b]target shooting[/b]. Though we use them for target shooting [b]which is fine [/b]but [b]we need to understand [/b]that [b]different barrel length handguns will give us different accuracy levels at different distant targets[/b]. As we all know [b]most of [/b]the [b]self-defense [/b]type shooting takes place [b]at the distances of 5 to 15 feet [/b]and the [b]most important thing [/b]comes here is the [b]reliability[/b] of the gun that it will go bang when needed. Here mostly people use [b]âPoint & Shootâ[/b] technique instead of playing with adjustable sights.\n\nReference to the posts regarding PT 92/99 full size/standard size handguns while Cougar is a compact size handgun. PT 92/99 is standard size handgun and has got 5â long Barrel. PT 917 is in between standard & compact handgun with the barrel length of 4 Inches. [b]We can understand[/b] that the [b]accuracy level of PT92/99 and PT 917 is more or less same but why do we expect the same level accuracy from Cougar which is compact handgun and has got 3.6â long barrel as compare to 5â barrel length handguns. [/b]\n\nIMHO, I think [b]PT 92/99 and the PT 917 are all well balanced handguns, reliable, smooth in their category [/b]and on the other hand [b]Stoeger Cougar is also reliable, smooth, well built, gives a bang each time you squeeze the trigger [/b](Mine even fires the FTF (misfired) rounds of other handguns) [b]it is reliable and have got better accuracy as per itâs characteristics.[/b] \n \nI think we need to define the [b]purpose[/b] of the handgun we intend to buy or use. If the gun is for [b]self-defense [/b]then [b]reliability[/b] and ease of use [b]needs to be on priority [/b]and [b]accuracy[/b] should be the [b]secondary[/b]. [b]I am not saying [/b]that we donât consider accuracy but the [b]standard of accuracy needs to be based on the handgunâs characteristics. [/b]', ''),

Take my word for it :)\nIn fact Imu10 shoots accurately from any imported gun he lays his hands on. After seeing his scores i am sure that whatever inaccuracy we experience is due to our faulty technique. Its true that some guns suit our hands better and we fire from them comfortably but it doesn''t mean that rest are inaccurate. ( Except for guns which require sight adjustment ).\nAn example. From 15m, my average score with different handguns is around 143/150. But i could not score even 130/150 from S&W Sigma. I could have concluded that it is little inaccurate but It was the same gun which was used by Imu10 to win the shooting competition at PNS range.', ''),

Take my word for it :)\nIn fact Imu10 shoots accurately from any imported gun he lays his hands on. After seeing his scores i am sure that whatever inaccuracy we experience is due to our faulty technique. Its true that some guns suit our hands better and we fire from them comfortably but it doesn''t mean that rest are inaccurate. ( Except for guns which require sight adjustment ).\nAn example. From 15m, my average score with different handguns is around 143/150. But i could not score even 130/150 from S&W Sigma. I could have concluded that it is little inaccurate but It was the same gun which was used by Imu10 to win the shooting competition at PNS range.[/quote]\n\nAmazing Shariq brother really impressive post[url=http://www.postimage.org/][img]http://s1.postimage.org/mO4xr.gif[/img][/url]', ''),

As for the numbers mentioned for muzzle velocity are [b]claims[/b] by the manufacturers themselves and not an assessment by any independent 3rd party.\n\nDecision is all yours and I''ll not try to influence it in anyway but share my experience here. Among others, I have owned three Diana airguns so far, Mod. 48, 54 & 35 and still have two of them in use. Meanwhile I have used various brands available here and different types of mechanisms and pellets from plastic to solid copper & steel balls.\n\nMy limited exposure to these types have made PCPs to be my favorite for pure shooting pleasure without noise & vibration and with quickest repeating shots. The downside is their reliability and availability of seals & technical expertise. These rifles are not designed to be rugged & need extra special care while in use. These are priced among the best spring loading air rifles. Its great fun if someone owns it and you get a chance to shoot it ;-)\n\nThe reasons why I ended up always buying Diana springers even though I like PCPs are their reliability, quality & performance that are second to none.\n\nI have used 2 Shadow 1000s. One purchased from Al Sayad & other from Neela Gumbad but found it to be almost half in effective range as compared to the three Dianas I have used. Dropping a kite in its feet from 50 yrds is a dream for Shadow 1000.[/quote]\n\n\nDear TAREEN Sb, \n\nI am much obliged by your another detailed reply which sounds positive and support your views for Diana Air Rifles, I would also check and would consider your suggested models as good/batter options (if easily available) when ever i will go for shop. btw I have started searching net for possiblities/reviews of these diana 27 and 31. \n\nThanks Again for the Good Concern\n\nregards,', ''),

(101485, ' [b]A RECENT ARTICLE IN DAILY DAWN ON HIS ANNIVERSARY[/b]\n\nAbdus Salamâs 15th death anniversary went unnoticed recently. The 25th death anniversary of Waheed Murad that fell on the same day was celebrated with fanfare. They say nations which do not honour their great men cease to produce them.\n\nPakistan, for sure, has produced no scientist of Salamâs stature nor perhaps an actor of Waheedâs popularity. Whether it is serious research or playful acting, the national scene remains barren.\n\nForgotten or celebrated, Pakistanâs few great men were born of accident. In the case of Abdus Salam it was not just one but a series of accidents. More strikingly, in converting accidents into opportunities, help to Salam came not from friends but from strangers. Ironically, when the people who should have been helping him created hurdles even that opened the door to new opportunity.\n\nHaving earned every degree that he could, setting new records before he was 19, Salamâs urge to go for research abroad would have remained unfulfilled had Sir Chhotu Ram, Punjabâs revenue minister and a benefactor of the rural poor, not arranged a scholarship for him at Cambridge. That was the first accident with help coming from an unexpected quarter.\n\nAs a Cambridge wrangler (first class of the mathematical tripos) and PhD in theoretical physics, Salam came back to teach at his alma mater. He thus seemed set on a course which, with luck, would have some day made him principal of Government College unless he was persuaded to join the ICS. Then came a second accident. He had gone to Bombay to attend an international scientific conference with the permission of the principal. He defied an order to return, leaving the conference halfway, because the education minister had not approved of his participation.\n\nHe resigned rather than face the charge and went back to teach at Cambridge. Three years later he became the youngest ever professor at Londonâs Imperial College and fellow of the Royal Society. There he freely debated with atheist Bertrand Russell the existence of God and with Albert Einstein the Islamic view of the unity of forces.\n\nIn 1959, there was to be yet another accident. Indiaâs high commissioner in London brought to him an invitation from Pundit Nehru to visit India. There Nehru offered him a ministerâs rank at a salary he would himself name with no questions asked about money spent or wasted on particle research. Taken unawares, Salam sought time to think it over, came back and reported to President Ayub what had transpired. He declined a similar offer from Ayub, but agreed to act as his scientific adviser while remaining at Imperial College. That was the period when the foundations of Pakistanâs atomic energy commission and nuclear power plants were laid.\n\nHe also advised the president to establish an international research centre in Pakistan where scientists from across the world would meet to exchange ideas and knowledge. The finance minister opposed the plan because he felt it was tantamount to setting up a five-star hotel for Salam and his friends. Again declining an Indian offer to host the centre, whatever the cost, he founded the centre at Trieste with a major contribution coming from the Italian government. Thousands of scientists have since passed through Trieste â no less than 500 from Pakistan. The centre is now named after Abdus Salam. Surely, by now Pakistan would have been a hub of scientific research had Ayubâs finance minister not ridiculed Salamâs plan.\n\nAfter winning the Nobel Prize in 1979, Salam was not invited to his own college. He did not even figure in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifâs count of distinguished old Ravians. It was Pakistanâs darkest period of prejudice and intellectual sterility. By contrast when he went to Aligarh Muslim University to receive an honorary doctorate, the whole city turned up to greet him and students pushed his car for a mile to the campus. The scene at Guru Nanak University was no less exhilarating.\n\nSalamâs repeated pleas to Islamic countries to contribute just one per cent of their export earnings to a research fund went unheeded. No wonder that Salam is the only one from the Islamic world ever to have won the Nobel Prize in the physical sciences.\n\nScientists who benefited from Salamâs Trieste centre â Mujahid Kamran, Ghulam Murtaza and Pervez Hoodbhoy among them â now struggle to make up for the lost time and opportunities. A school of mathematics named after him is fast gaining recognition. LUMS too has established an Abdus Salam chair.\n\nEven the people at large are fast shedding the prejudices fostered by politicians. The scientists and citizens of today alike would go along with what Prof Ahmad Ali of Aligarh had to say in 1979: âAbdus Salam is not the name of a person but of a movement that seeks to wipe out poverty and ignorance. It is a movement for knowledge and wisdom, action and endurance, to restore pride in our own culture and to wage jihad against prejudice, tyranny and exploitationâ.\n\nWhen Salam came to deliver the Faiz Memorial Lecture at Lahore, people wondered what a hard-nosed scientist and a romantic poet had in common. âWe both are persona non grata in our own country,â Salam explained. Then he showed to the audience the couplet Faiz once wrote in his own hand in Salamâs diary when they met at a foreign airport: Nisar mein teri galiyon pe ai watan keh jahan chali hai rasm key koi na sar utha ke chaley (My life is dedicated to the streets of the motherland where custom demands that no one should walk with head held high). It is a sad thought that Pakistanâs most brilliant scientist and most popular poet should have been the prime victims of that custom.\n\nFinally, here is an example of Salamâs humour and humility thrown into one. Asked whether Jhang, the village of Heer, would henceforth be known as the village of Salam, he replied: âRemember there is only one Heer, Nobel laureates are many.â Indeed there are but only one came from Pakistan. When we can walk the streets with our heads held high will be the day to remember Salam and Faiz. It would not be possible without them.', ''),

I am sure a lot of times the attitude felt is only a reflection of the attitude one is carrying or showing to the dealer, and it is difficult for most people to see their own issues.\n\nI think that there is no set formula.

It is in never used condition, and was well preserved with grease and oil.

Even by looking at  the pic that you posted, they can tell you stuff. \nI can tell you a bit about eagle over N related to Walther P99. Here goes Copy/Paste.\n\nThe slide, barrel, and frame of 100% German-made P99s bear the "eagle over N" proofmark, which signifies that the pistol was tested with a "proof load." The "N" stands for nitro cellulose, which is used in gun powder. The frame, on the right side under the accessory rail, also bears a staghorn proofmark that signifies that the proofing was done at the ULM/DO proof house. HK pistols are also proofed at ULM/DO.\n\nFor 2005 and later P99s, including the P99c (Compact), the only proofmark on the frame is the "eagle over N," located on the right side of the trigger guard, in the top-front corner\n\nSo I guess Its a good thing for pistols.

(101853, ' Asalamualaikum everyone, \n\nPG gatherings are always a treat to be part of. Filled with diversity, dynamism, experience, humor and spirit of brotherhood. Here one gets to experience what pursuit of honest friendship is all about. \n\nWhile we had several senior members attending last night, we also had the pleasure of personally meeting some new members for the first time, and what a pleasure it was to get to know (though a little bit) about our brother Mangloo Ramzani - a guy with immense knowledge, energy and spirit of patriotism. An expert in his field and a true gentlemen. Sirjee, the ''amuds'' which you and BloodBath were experiencing during our session, were for us like a dive in a pool of knowledge and rich info. Sessions like those always rekindle that patriotism which we all Alhamdolillah have in our DNA. \n\nLikewise, it was a pleasure meeting and knowing brother BulletHog, Rizshu, Bilz111, the ''roaring'' Kakar, ''towering'' Gatlingun, ''mighty and magnanimous'' AbuAlHawl, MAK786, ARJ and EfKay. Though I''d earlier met Kakar and Gatlingun individually, but it was a treat to have them in our GTG and I''m sure everyone enjoyed their company as did they. Abbas'' sublime presence was like icing on the cake. His introduction during the GTG was enjoyed by all.\n\nSpecial congratulations to our brother BloodBath for being awarded the Tamgha-e-Imtiaz this week by the Chief of Army Staff himself. Sir, you''re lucky you didn''t get it during March 23rd ceremony. Would have spoilt all the pleasure and honor of getting the award. :) I salute you and brother ManglooRamzani for your dedication, commitment and patriotism. \n\nReasons for choosing Lal-Qila again included its central location, easy accessibility, food variety and suitable setting for our GTG.\n\nOne of the highlights of the evening was a ''telephonic khitaab'' by brother Denovo from Sialkot. He''s so good in mimicking that for a few seconds it was very difficult to distinguish it from the [i]usual[/i] one we [i]experience[/i]. Missed you bro as we did all our brothers from other cities. Dr. Hanif Sb, you were remembered too as was AK47.\n\nThough we did not have the services of brother Naveed_Pk, our Official expert photographer available to us in Karachi, however, Taurus, GunPsycho, Gatlingun and some waiters tried their level best to fill the gap, which I''m sure they could not.\n\nWe missed Kamran, Sqd Ldr Shariq and Sohail bhai and wish Sohail bhai''s kids early and smooth recovery from measles. \n\nImran bhai, next time you''ll have me hovering all over you during the whole GTG. ;)\n\nIn the end I''d like to thank all honorable members for blessing this GTG with their presence. \n\nWe all had to be asked to leave the premises by Lal-Qila management at around 12:30am and the management had to close all the lights to convince us that it was time to leave. Even then brother Gatlingun and GunPsycho were not ready to leave. :)\n\nHere''s one of the ''tagged'' group photo.\n\n[quote=Taurus]\n[img]http://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww288/Taurus247/DSC03429.jpg[/img][/quote]\n\n[b]TOP ROW (L to R):[/b]\nRizshu, ARJ, EfKay, Mangloo Ramzani, Kakar, Vik, HammadArshad, OMKhan, MAK786 and Osama.\n\n[b]MIDDLE ROW - Seated (L to R):[/b]\nGunPsycho, Immu10, Taurus, Salahuddin, Abbas, Daudpota, Gatlingun and Abu Al Hawl.\n\n[b]BOTTOM ROW - (L to R):[/b]\nBloodBath, BullsEye, BulletHog, Memon and Osam.\n\n(ARK Tareen is missing from this picture as he''s taking the pictures.)\n\n\nARK Tareen Sb is the one with white beard sitting between Abu Al Hawl and Daudpota Sb in mid row in Taurus'' post''s last pic.', ''),

However, as per the results of one test, CZ75 is rated in [b]FAIRLY ACCURATE[/b] category.  I think this pistol is capable of firing far better. Look at the groups and look at the fire from 30 M. If a compact pistol can hit all bullets within 5 points ring from 30M, what else one needs. :)\n\nThis is how the owner of the handgun shot 10 rounds from 15 M with a single hand. A 2 inch group. Istn''t it great :) It was indeed an honour to have Skeeter60 sahib and his friend Ahmad with us. There is so much to learn from Skeeter sahib that one falls short of time.

The gun grips were for right hander and as you know it has a distinct cut for resting the thumb on left side and I am a lefty, this thumb rest was obstructing with my firing hand / finger. \n\n-  The gun was not zeroed from 30 M. \n\nAs you can see Ruger is making a 2.2 inches group from 30 M which is remarkable. But since the group is over the bull, it gets a low score. It has adjustable sights. With a properly zeroed gun, this gun would easily score over 140 in my view.  :)', ''),

(101953, ' Aquarius bother thanks. Glock 17 will perform well, I know it. I am now more interested in testing most of the low end guns that most of us can afford to buy, like Turkish, Chinese and Taurus guns. That is where most members can benefit. You see many of us can not afford to buy a Glock, S&W, Colt, Kimber, H&K, Sig Sauer, CZ etc. Top quality pistols like these will mostly perform well in my opinion but in most cases are out of our reach. :)\n\n@All\nHere I must again clarify that this thread deals with the accuracy of a pistol only, worked out on absolute basis (not on comparative basis) by conducting a standard test. A very accurate pistol therefore would not always mean that it is the best gun for all purposes and a relatively less accurate pistol (I said relatively less accurate, not in-accurate) would also not mean that it is no good. One can compromise a little on accuracy for want of a conceal carry gun but having a very concealable gun with no accuracy would not be of much use. What I mean to say is that there has to be a bottom limit for accuracy and one should understand that below this standard, it would not be of much practical use to carry a handgun. \n\nAlso, when we say a [b]CC gun[/b] than it sould be a CC gun like Glock 26, H&K sk2000, Sig P239, Taurus PT111 Millennium Pro, Taurus 609, Taurus 709, Walther PPK/S, Ruger SR9 compact, CZ2025 Rami, S&W M&P9 Compact, CZ83, Beretta Bobcat etc etc. For such small guns which are obviously meant to be hidden in ones clothing, one may compromise a little on accuracy. In my personal view, if we take the standards set in this thread as a guideline, even these guns [b]should not be below 60 % or AVERAGE rating.[/b]   \n\nThan we have [b]compact size guns[/b] like Glock 19, CZ75 C, USP Compact, Beretta PX4 Storm, Stoeger Cougar, Walther P99, S&W M&P9, Canik Piranha Compact, Tanfoglio Force Compact etc. These guns are small enough to be carried on person (also called duty guns or officer models etc) but have sufficient range also to fire with fair degree of accuracy at a medium distance (like 15-20 M). Most of these guns, however, can not be properly hidden in summer clothing. In my personal view, taking the same tests as guideline, they [b]should preferably fall in minimum 70% or FAIRLY ACCURATE category. [/b]\n\nThan we have the [b]full size (Large Frame) models[/b], like Glock 17, Beretta 92fs, CZ75B, 1911 frame pistol (in large frame) of various companies, Sig P210, P226, H&K USP, Browning High Power, Baikal 446 Viking, CZ999 Scorpion, Taurus PT92/99, Canik Piranha, Kanuni S, Zigana, Tanfoglio Force and there is a large no of full size pistols. These pistols must be able to perform all types of combat tasks hence [b]should be accurate (Minimum 80%)[/b]. \n\nThan we have competition or target pistols. These pistols have just one purpose; to fire accurately. This category can be further subdivided into two. One is Precision shooting and the other is Practical / Tactical Shooting (IPSC type). [b]For precision shooting[/b], size, shape and other things are not important and every thing is homed on attaining one capability; more and more accuracy. Such pistols are carried in the box to the range and brought back in the box; no holster carry. Pistols used for precision shooting include Pardini, Hammerli, Walther GSP Expert, Ruger MkIII Competition, Browning Buckmark etc. [b]For practical / tactical shooting[/b], we need a gun which is very very accurate but at the same time can be carried in the holster also for use during range tests. Pistols include Sig P226 X6 and X5, STI Target Master and many other STI double stack 1911 models, H&K Mk 23, H&K USP Expert, Kimber Gold Match, CZ75 TS, S&W Performance Center 1911 models, Glock 34, etc etc. Some of the practical shooting pistols like Sig P226 X6, H&K Mk 23, STI Target Master, S&W I911 (6 inch barrel) are good enough for precision shooting as well. Bottom line is that [b]all competition pistols need to be exceptionally accurate[/b] and there is no compromise on high accuracy. \n\nIMHO, when we are buying a pistol, we must keep the purpose in mind for which that pistol is being bought and accordingly select an appropriate pistol. [b]Every pistol cant be good in every thing (cant be very concealable and most accurate at the same time)[/b]. Accordingly, we should also have a rough understanding that what accuracy standards do we expect from the pistol that we buy. [b]In any case, a pistol must not fall below the bare minimum accuracy level otherwise it is of little practical use.[/b] Just my two cents on the issue. :)\n\nregards', ''),

Than, I came across the quotation "All That Is Necessary for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing!" and decided to play an active role. Thanks all at PG in general and moderators Specially for such excellent effort to bring likeminded ppl at single forum. \n\nSHORT LIST! As I started to write down only weapons were in mind than I moved to my gadgets and the list got longer. \n\nSURVIVALIST! I adopted this nick as SURVIVALISM is one of the topics I am researching now a days. I came across this term when I was looking for how to survive if things go wrong. These days we are facing alot of such issues like "The War Within", war in neighbour country, shortfall of everyday consumables and price hike like Rice, Patrol, Electricity, Atta etc. People have enough education and experience but unable to HUNT jobs. People have money but unable to start good business. So if this situation lingers on, survivalism awareness trainings will be of much benifit.\n\nABOUT ME! I am an IT and Project Management expert. I liek photography and travel a lot. Fond of "machines of excellence" including weapons, gadgets, 4x4 vehicles and Cameras. I like mountains, meadows and nature in general. Reads poetry and fiction, admires art movies, writre articles on IT, Management and Information Security and have a good collection of Sniping, Shooting movies and some excellect Training videos. \n\nThe best of my days are those which I spend with nature in mountains with my camera (missing Sony R1 that I sold last year) and backpack.\n\nCONTRIBUTION! I can and am intended to contribute as much information as I have on following topics and to learn from Seniors at this forum alot.\n\n1. Survivalism\n2. Gadgets\n3. Everyday Carry\n4. Photography and equipment\n5. Guns and ammo\n6. IT, webdev, Project Management\n7.

(102290, ' [quote=12gauge]now one might think that a CC weapon would be less accurate than a full sized firearms but if its less accurate, then by how much. this is what Gilani Sb. is trying to answer for everybody else. [/quote]\n12guage Sir, thanks for the comments and support. :)\n\nNow coming to this important and interesting aspect that [b]how much accurate a CC weapon should be[/b]. General belief is that since a CC weapon is to be shot at a very close range in self defence and not for precision shooting in a competition; therefore not much of accuracy is required of a CC weapon. Agreed, that a CC weapon is neither designed to hit all bullets in the bull from 25 meter nor it is capable of doing so and only a fool would select a CC weapon for target shooting. However, how much is the accuracy that we need for a self defence fire on short ranges, is the question?\n\nThere is no mathematical answer to this question. However, one can analyse likely environment under which one will have to undertake this type of fire. It is likely to be characterised by following:-\n\n-  [b]Quick reaction[/b]; which implies a quick draw, simultaneous cocking of the gun / removal of safety, quick aiming and finally, an accurate shot. Mind you, this all is happening in a state of panic / fear which means that a firer will have very less time to aim while his heart is pounding at a speed of zillion miles per hour and still he has to be dead accurate otherwise he would not be there to curse his firing skills or inaccuracy of the gun. A firer therefore has to be well trained. But what about the gun? Can even a well trained firer with steel reflexes like to have a gun which is not accurate? Lets now see the gun part :)  \n\n-  For a while, just compare the above environment to the environment in which I carry out the tests. Absolutely relaxed, I sit on a chair, put my elbows on a table and take all the time to aim on a target which is a static target, does not move and has no capability to fire back at me. [b]During these ideal conditions, if a gun is firing 7 or 8 inches away from the point of aim from just 10 M, would you like to trust this gun during actual situation[/b] when one might be firing with a pounding heart and trembling hands. At least I would not like to have such a gun. \n\nI wish I had filmed one of the SD firing practices that Skeeter60 sahib demonstrated once we were testing different weapons. We had three targets placed at 3 ft away from each other and Skeeter60 sahib stood at 7 M with his back towards the targets. On word go, he turned around, while turning he drew his gun from holster (CZ75 in first practice and G19 in second), racked the slide, aimed and fired 2 bullets on 1st, 2 on 2nd and 2 on 3rd target. He was clocked 4.26 and 4.60 seconds for completing this complete drill (and all bullets were within 6-8 inches from the bull). That was a brilliant skill which any firer could be proud of (mind you Skeeter sahib is 63). \n\nAfter the fire I asked Skeeter60 sahib that how important is accuracy in this type of fire from short range? Can we afford to have a gun which is less accurate? He said that the weapon has to be dead accurate for this type of engagement. I would request Skeeter60 sahib to elaborate further on this..........\n\n[b]My final deduction was that even for CC, we need to have a weapon which is dead accurate in the tests from 10 M and reasonably accurate from 20 M.[/b] Mind you most of us do not have the skills that Skeeter60 sahib possess and a normal firer may expect at least double the amount of inaccuracy what has been established during the tests conducted under ideal environment.    \n\nAny views...........', ''),

Additionally, I''d appreciate if the [b]thread[/b] used for the sewing could be in "[b]white[/b]" color.\n\nThe holster itself will be [b]plain[/b] and the belt plain as well as you describe above, bullet belt not necessary, coz it''s been my experience that after some time of usage the loops do get loose and bullets drop out. Done at 3500. If satisfied, a black one may follow.\n\nYet, one important thing, I''d still appreciate if the [b]inner[/b] could be double coated with some laminated stuff, i.e [b]artificial leather [/b] in same color as the exterior or some coudra/canvas, even "parachute" material, as to completely exclude risk of [b]leather acid[/b] during hot and humid months. That can damage the finishing of the gun.\n\nYou lined my last holster''s inner with a layer of suede, and I believe it may be protecting, for sure, but it doesn''t look quite "finished" and gives a "rough" appearance where visible even with the gun holstered. So plz see, if any of above suggestions for the inner is workable.\n\nOnce above details done and agreed, I''ll present myself at your shop, for sure, so the size of the mag could be recorded as well.

Secondly, this was a drill but even then the weapon had the safety engaged and before drawing, switching the thumb safety off is another practice which is important in this technique.\n\nAs far as obstacles are concerned, there were none here but if present, one can easily carry out this practice without stepping backwards.

She wasn''t afraid because it was a small\nCOMMUNITY and she lived only a few blocks away...\n\nAs she walked along under the bike trail Amina asked\nALLAH TA?''ALA to keep her safe from harm and\ndanger.\n\nWhen she reached the alley, which was a short cut to\nher house, she decided to take it.  However, halfway\n\ndown the alley she noticed a man standing at the end\nas though he were waiting for her.\n\nShe became uneasy and began to recite a Dua, asking\nfor ALLA TA?''ALA''s protection instantly a comforting\n\nfeeling of quietness and security wrapped round her,\nshe felt as though someone was walking with her.\n\nWhen she reached the end of the alley, she walked\nright past the man and arrived home safely.\n\nThe following day, she read in the newspaper that a\nyoung girl had been raped in the same alley just twenty\nminutes after she had been there.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and the fact that\nit could have been her, she began to weep.\n\nThanking ALLAH TA?''ALA for her safety and to help\nthis young woman who was raped, she decided to go\nto the police station.\n\nShe felt she could recognize the man, so she told them\nher story.\n\nThe police asked her if she would be willing to look at\na lineup to see if she could identify him..\n\nShe agreed and immediately pointed out the man she\nhad seen in the alley the night before.\n\nWhen the man was told he had been identified, he\nimmediately broke down and confessed.\n\nThe officer thanked Amina for her bravery and asked if\nthere was anything they could do for her.\n\nShe asked if they would ask the man one question.\nAmina was curious as to why he had not attacked her.\n\nWhen the policeman asked him, he answered, ''Because\nshe wasn''t alone.  She had two tall men walking on\n\neither side of her.....''\n\nAmazingly, whether you believe or not, you''re not\nalone.

Tell us how much you paid for it and where did you get it from? you are such a silent striker indeed :)\n\n[quote=Maximus]rounds cycled perfect but light primer strikes on 2 chinese whitebox. was alarming at first but too quick to judge as my first 50 rounds went clean with no FTF/FTE.[/quote]\nAbove, I read the comments from Slayerjatt and Anthrax brothers about lighter firing pin strikes on the primers. I feel bad in simple words and a bit surprised too as lighter primer indentations were heard in case of 24/7 series and never for the hammer fired 800 series. Although they were 2/72 rounds fired but still it should not happen ideally. Sir please do your pistol a favor. You will require a degreaser here in a can spray configuration. Thoroughly clear the firing pin channel with it. Let it dry out and do not oil in the firing pin channel after it. Do it before the next firing session you may have. I would not advise you to disassemble the firing pin channel altogether right now, but later if the results are not satisfactory you''ll need that too. We can then look for a bent firing pin spring, any possible obstruction such as a metal shaving or some nasty piece of sticky gunk that didnt help out with ordinary spraying of degreaser. I hope for you the ordinary spraying works out.\n\n[quote=Maximus]\nabout the double strike feature he rightly said..." Why would a gun company make such a feature??" and later answered jokingly "......unless they already know its not gonna fire right the first time! "  :D. Whatever the case 93% chances of the round going off on the second strike so its all good according to the technical brochure and practical experience.[/quote]\nThis double strike is a true feature or rather an innovation on all Taurus "DS" (double strike) models in 24/7 line of pistols. Once firing pin is released on trigger pull, it can be recocked and then released by a subsequent trigger pull which works similarly to DA pull in traditional DA hammer pistols. Instead of a hammer a striker fired system is found in all 24/7s therefore they are named as Double Strike "DS" capable. Very few handguns are able to do this. Now coming to 800 series they are hammer fired traditional Double Action/Single Action Pistols. All DA/SA pistols have ability to fire DA if the hammer is un-cocked. So in case of 800 series it nothing new it is only hyped by Taurus U.S marketing in their brochures and web sites. 800 pistol is a common DA/SA pistol indeed and it is not justified to call it a double striker. 24/7 DS models are double true strikers.', ''),

For that to manifest in reality, either of the two or both of these flaws must be there in the 845 you fired:\n\n1- The barrel had a clearly visible(to human eye) droop in complete lockup with slide. It rather had a tilted drop in fit which by itself required a specially tailored slide and locking blocks to function.\n\n2- The height of the ridiculous front sight was nearly double of that of rear sight. \n\nNow please confirm which one or both of the flaws do you think were there? :)\n\nTo my understanding, even I would not completely rule out the possibility of such flaws ever existed in a production gun would still recommend any one to better understand the grip of the new pistol. The errors are mostly in our shooting. The grip and the trigger they are, specially in a new pistol that we were not familiar to and more over if the new pistol had entirely different ergonomics than the hand guns we were used to fire such can happen  :) and brother please dont mind my funny tone in this comment...

Although many would say it as moving away from simplicity of design and function which often results in lowering the probability of reliability.

If a gun is in-accurate it is obviously more likely to fail at a most crucial time.\nA hand gun is only going to be accurate  when the following criteria are met:\n\nThe slide to frame fit is correct\nThe Barrel to slide fit is correct\nThe barrel bushing is properly fitted to the barrel ( 1911 type pistols )\nThe  slide /barrel lock up is repeatable and rigid\nThe trigger has minimal back lash and lock time\nThe trigger is not creepy and Not  very light or too heavy\nThe barrel is polished smooth and of correct inner dimensions (Rifling, chamber throat,forcing cone angle and muzzle crown perfect and proper angle\nIf the above are lacking the gun is not likely to be accurate and it also means it is made sloppily and more likely to fail due to breakages or FE, FF, etc etc.\nAbove all an accurate gun reminds you to keep training to improve your shooting whereas an in-accurate gun is a discouragement.\nIn to days unfortunate circumstances when crime is up a hostage rescue situation is more than likely; I do not think any one would like to take a shot at the head of a kidnapper while he is shielding his body with an innocent hostage with an in accurate gun; especially when the hostage may be a near and dear one. In real world scenarios when one has to use his gun, one is nervous, with adrenaline in the system, hands shaking and coordination poor. One wants every millimeter of precision on his side.', ''),

If one is good at precision shooting, its just a matter of time that he would be a master in rapid fire as well. \n\nSeeing it from another angle, an accurate single shot is likely to produce better results than two inaccurate double taps (its better to hit one instead of missing four :) ).

When the range is longer than than perhaps 12 to 15 yds I would prefer quick well aimed singles. May be my reflexes are slower or I do not train enough with the ammo being expansive.\n\nMy idea is to be able to draw and fire a single in one one second at a range of 3 yds and then a double tap on three tgts at the range of 7 yds in less than 4 seconds including drawing and racking the slide. Hits will only be scored if there are two B zone hits or at least one A zone hit on each tgt. I will give tgts free to Pakguns members contacting to get these and post the dimensions so that all can follow a standard tgt system. These are humanoid tgts with scoring according to vital zones.', ''),

Please do join me for an angling trip during your next visit to Pakistan. I always fancy fishing in UK, lot of trouts and salmons and pikes and breams you know. Excellent place for fly fishing. Pakistan, however, is different. What I have learnt during my time spent in this hobby is that you are only a master when you know the area and waters well. In a new area, one is just like a novice, despite all his angling experience. So its better to ask from the locals and they always have something unique to tell you (this is what I always do). You see, same fish in different areas will have different eating preferences. Same bait and style don''t therefore work everywhere. Boilies and other such baits do work very well in UK for carp fishing because fish are used to them. In Pakistan, carps are more used to wheat, corn and rice oriented baits because this is what is mostly grown around the waters overhere. \nIt would be a pleasure to accompany you on a fishing trip :)', ''),

(102767, ' [quote=Slayerjatt]sir skeeter your every post is a source of learning for newbies like me. you''ve explained very well. just one question, how important is the barrel length for a range upto 10 yards?[/quote]\n\nThe  barrel length provides two things \nEnough length of barrel so that the bullet has time to accelerate and reach a certain velocity.\nProvide enough sight radius for accurate aiming.\nNow most pistol barrels are designed around a compromise of about 4 inches, as it suits concealed carry, the weight and balance is desirable and the sight radius as well as the bullets muzzle velocity/energy is acceptable.\n\nFor neutralizing a threat one needs a certain amount of muzzle energy which happens to be around 200 (+) foot pounds. A 9mm delivers from 300 to 460 ft lbs depending on different loadings, and barrels from 3 to 5 inches.\nPistols like the .22 deliver from about 70 to 120 ft lbs depending again on barrel lengths from 1 1/2 inch to 4 inches.\nActually multiple hits and the shot placement is more important than the muzzle energy of one bullet.\nA.22 in the head will drop any one and there are recorded cases of people having escaped and survived hits from .357 magnums in the torso.\nThere is need to align sights if one wants to deliver aimed hits in the vital areas. Please try to shoot in a timed practice at a range of only 6 yds and there will be a realisation that aiming is required and can be done in as short a time as about one second or a bit more depending on practice.\nI hope I am able to answer your question as I tried to cover all types of calibers and hand guns without going into specifics. \nA 2 inch barrel is sufficient for aiming at 10 yds but the Muzzle energy will suffer badly as there will be a big muzzle flash and blast but the bullet will have comparatively less energy. One of these days I will post  a chart giving various barrel lengths, bullet wts/ Calibers and Muzzle Energy/Velocity figures', ''),

I am more comfortable with a Glock with a round in the chamber than with any other Cocked and Locked gun.\nDeveloping safe habits with regular practice is a must. Always draw a gun with your tringer finger straight out and as the gun clears the holster and as you begin pointing your gun only then place your finger on the trigger.', ''),

Early on  this was very fashionable to shoot from the hip and movies promoted it.

In our infantry batallions shooting weapons is our bread and butter and we shoot almost every other day.\nShooting from the hip is a reflex action and a trained reflex does help but a properly trained person can shoot just as fast with deadly results where as the shots fired from the hip do not assure a first round neutralization all the time.', ''),

[b]My guess is around is around early fifties or so.[/b] Early on  this was very fashionable to shoot from the hip and movies promoted it. But those who have been ''there'' have slightly different opinion. \nIn our army it was a training practice to fire from the hip at at ranges from 7 to 25 meters, I fought for practically ten years to get rid of this waste full practice which consumed thousands of rds per batallion per month. In our infantry batallions shooting weapons is our bread and butter and we shoot almost every other day.\nShooting from the hip is a reflex action and a trained reflex does help [b]but a properly trained person can shoot just as fast with deadly results[/b] where as the shots fired from the hip do not assure a first round neutralization all the time.[/quote]\n\nQuite right sir.

(102918, ' [quote=vik][quote=Gilani]Skeeter60 Sir, a priceless advise as always. We must never overlook the basics :)\n\nEducative input from everyone. I would just like to add that in IMHO, in an effort to execute faster double taps / other rapid fire techniques, we must never overlook lessons of deliberate precision shooting which is the basic shooting skill. All rapid fire techniques are nothing but a fast execution of precision shooting (the same has been amply explained by the shooting instructor in the movie referred to by Faisji sahib).  If one is good at precision shooting, its just a matter of time that he would be a master in rapid fire as well. \n\nSeeing it from another angle, an accurate single shot is likely to produce better results than two inaccurate double taps (its better to hit one instead of missing four :) ). I don''t at all mean to say that double taps are useless and should not be resorted to. But since most of us are still in the learning stage and a double tap / other rapid fire techniques certainly appear more fascinating / devastating than a single shot, there might be a danger of overlooking the basics like focusing on front site, trigger and breathing control. In rapid fire, we do the same thing but faster. Just my two cents on the subject :)[/quote]\nAgreed. Basic bull''s eye training is important. It is like get to know session of the handgun. \n[b]But focus sing on front site and breathing control will all be forgotten during confrontation with an intruder(s).\nThe only thing remembered will be point and shoot.[/b][/quote]\nIt is quite likely that one forgets about the shooting basics when the real situation comes. That is why it is said that there is no substitute to hard and continuous training. Once a drill is repeated thousands and thousands of time, it becomes one''s reflex action and that person just performs the act without even thinking about it. Hard training also helps in overcoming fear and nervousness. This is how professional soldiers are trained. Practice a drill so many times that it becomes part of nature :) We may not have the opportunities and facilities available to professional soldiers but still, there is no shortcut to training............', ''),

Interestingly they have some Taiwan made cheap crossbows, 50 LBS handheld for around 4k.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n[quote]Here''s a question I asked on a previous thread about Tasers \n\nIt has come to my attention that "Gown House" in Pindi are stocking Taser electroshock devices and retailing them at Rs 25000.\n\nWould one of the brothers in Pindi be kind enough to inquire about the model and country of origin and please post details?\n\n[url]http://www.gownhouse.com/index.jsp[/url]\n\nThanx for any responses\nNo one responded with an answer to this, Id still be interested to know what model they stock.\n\n\n\nHere''s something else I previously stated in relation to the effectiveness of Tasers\n\n\n\nYou know I was thinking about the man stopping potential of a good quality taser and from what Ive seen on youtube videos where it has been deployed by U.S cops it looks very impressive. It instantly incapacitates its target on contact and I would even go as far as to say that in some circumstances it would be even more effective at neutralising  a threat than a firearm.\nWhat do you think guys?\n\n[/quote]', ''),

A fixed barrel gun is usually extremely accurate, look at the Ruger Mk 2 and 3, the buck mark and the makarov all of which have fixed barrels and blow back actions. Only low powered rounds can be fired with a blow back action unless the weapon is heavy.\n  Most revolvers have so many things going against them yet they are very accurate. A revolver has six different chambers, the bullet has to jump from a cylinder into the barrel and then the gas escapes from the barrel cylinder  gap yet most proper revolvers have phenomenal accuracy.', ''),

(103038, ' [quote=Gilani][quote=vik][quote=Gilani]Skeeter60 Sir, a priceless advise as always. We must never overlook the basics :)\n\nEducative input from everyone. I would just like to add that in IMHO, in an effort to execute faster double taps / other rapid fire techniques, we must never overlook lessons of deliberate precision shooting which is the basic shooting skill. All rapid fire techniques are nothing but a fast execution of precision shooting (the same has been amply explained by the shooting instructor in the movie referred to by Faisji sahib).  If one is good at precision shooting, its just a matter of time that he would be a master in rapid fire as well. \n\nSeeing it from another angle, an accurate single shot is likely to produce better results than two inaccurate double taps (its better to hit one instead of missing four :) ). I don''t at all mean to say that double taps are useless and should not be resorted to. But since most of us are still in the learning stage and a double tap / other rapid fire techniques certainly appear more fascinating / devastating than a single shot, there might be a danger of overlooking the basics like focusing on front site, trigger and breathing control. In rapid fire, we do the same thing but faster. Just my two cents on the subject :)[/quote]\nAgreed. Basic bull''s eye training is important. It is like get to know session of the handgun. \n[b]But focus sing on front site and breathing control will all be forgotten during confrontation with an intruder(s).\nThe only thing remembered will be point and shoot.[/b][/quote]\nIt is quite likely that one forgets about the shooting basics when the real situation comes. That is why it is said that there is no substitute to hard and continuous training. Once a drill is repeated thousands and thousands of time, it becomes one''s reflex action and that person just performs the act without even thinking about it. Hard training also helps in overcoming fear and nervousness. This is how professional soldiers are trained. Practice a drill so many times that it becomes part of nature :) We may not have the opportunities and facilities available to professional soldiers but still, there is no shortcut to training............[/quote]\nTotally agree with u SIR.

(103158, ' [quote=Sonnenkind]Sir Skeeter sahab, thanks for sharing most valuable insight on both barrel types. Two follow up questions:\n\n1- Is the bend in the barrel, or favour, by design? or a result of workmanship? or just metal fatiguing from use? I can''t think of any design purpose it might serve, especially on rotary barrels.[/quote]\n\nThe bending or slight favouring to one side is not by design, it is because when a barrel is made from stock steel bars these are lifted by fork trucks dumped and thrown and then these are cut into barrel size, then holes are drilled, and then the rifling is hook cut, button rifled or forged. All these steps cause a lot of stress on the barrel, although the barrels are annealed and re hardened in between all these steps cause the barrels to be slightly bent.\nMetal also has a memory, if it were bent to one side and later straightened it will favour its original angle when heated. This bending is very pronounced in rifles as compared to pistol barrels.', ''),

(103162, ' [quote=Sonnenkind]Did i say two questions? :)\n\n2- Sir what part, if any, does the recoil spring''s rigidity/un-rigidity play in the accuracy of a handgun. With use, a fairly tough spring lessens in tension significantly. I''m thinking, with a round setting off in the chamber, the bullet''s motion forward and the slide''s motion rearward start simultaneously, so how does a tighter or looser spring affect matters here, if at all?[/quote]\n\nThe main purpose of a counter recoil spring is to keep the slide locked forward and to feed and chamber and lock the slide.\nThe recoil does start once the round is fired but the slide only moves back after the bullet has exited the barrel.\nMost pistols are recoil operated, it means that as the bullet leaves the barrel the barrel and the slide move back togather  which cause un locking of the slide and then on the slide moves back alone with the remaining gas pressure extracting and ejecting the fired case and then rebounds with the power of the recoil spring to feed ,chamber and lock the slide with the barrel.\nJust take your 9mm ( make sure it is un loaded) and press its muzzle against a table and you will see that the barrel and slide move back togather a certain distance. The slightest back ward movement disconnects the trigger and the recoil operated 9mms will not fire when pressed against any thing.\nNow take a steel cleaning rod and press the breach or the slide after inserting the rod into the barrel you will see that the barrel/slide will not move back.\n Also a lose/weak  spring will result in damaging the pistol frame in the long run as the slide impact velocity will be higher. Both steel and alloy frames do crack under such circumstances.\nA tight spring can make the feeding out of time as it will make the slide return before the magazine spring can present a round at a proper angle for feeding specially when the magazine is loaded to capacity.\nI hope I have done justice to your question.', ''),

(103243, ' [quote=Skeeter60]The recoil does start once the round is fired but the slide only moves back after the bullet has exited the barrel. [/quote]\nThis is a very important aspect described by Skeeter sahib and it simply means that by the time we feel recoil and see the muzzle flipping up and slide moving back, the bullet has already left the muzzle. This highlights the importance of correct aim and smooth trigger control with regards to accuracy. Sometimes we un-necessarily stress on gripping a hand gun and adopting a perfect bookish stance etc. IMHO, a shot fired with even a slightly weaker grip and less ideal stance can produce better results if the aim was correct and trigger control was good. Conversely, a shot fired even with the strongest of grips and best of stances would not normally produce a good shot if the aim (focusing on front sight) was not right and trigger squeeze was not smooth. I don''t at all mean to say that one should be absolutely casual about grip and stance and that it''s not important. What I mean to say is that while shooting, those aspects that matter more should consume maximum of our attention and focus. \n\nSkeeter sahib has very elaborately covered various aspects related to mechanics of a handgun that enhance accuracy or otherwise. Just thought that discussion was getting too gun mechanics oriented so let''s discuss the subject from a slightly different angle. IMHO, generally speaking, inaccuracy in handgun fire is more because of the firer''s faults than the faulty construction of gun parts. Precision comes when we do the basics right :)\n\nWhy I am harping upon the same thing again and again. The only reason is that I know many of us do not get sufficient opportunity to improve our shooting skill. Mainly due to paucity of shooting ranges and partly due to price of ammo, we end up firing far less than what is required to become an accurate shot. In this environment, we must try to gain maximum benefit from our limited shooting practices and therefore, beginners or mediocre shooters are advised to concentrate on improving their basic shooting skills if they do not shoot very often. Advanced shooting drills, rapid fire drills etc look very fascinating / thrilling but mostly consume lot of ammo and their practice would be counter productive anyway if someone is weak in basic skills like say trigger control. Experienced shooters, however, may concentrate on any kind of drills they deem appropriate. \nThanks and regards', ''),

Follow through is  one of the most important aspects of shooting, specially pistol shooting. I give a favourite example of hitting a ball with a Cricket Bat the direction where you move the Bat or Hockey or Raquette  after hitting the ball determines where you want to send the ball.\n\nIn shooting if we do no not follow through then before the shot is fired or the bullet is still in the barrel we relax some muscles or tense some muscles in anticipation of recoil and muzzle blast and this movement is enough to throw our good shot from a 10 to a 7.\nWe must remain on aim even after firing a shot and recover from the recoil in a systematic manner.', ''),

I understand that the purpose of it is to ''gyroscopically stabilize'' the bullet by giving it a spin, so there is no bias one way or other on its trajectory.

I can get into an extremely technical discussion but for the sake of most of my younger friends the rifling stabilizes the projectile or the bullet.\nA 30-06 has a rifling twist of one turn in 10 inches as it has to stabilize bullets of upto 220 grains, a 308 win on the other hand has a twist of 1 in 12 inches to stabilise bullets of upto 180 grains .\nA 5.56 rifle firing only 55 grain bullets required only 1 turn in 12 inches but the newer 62 grain bullet is only stabilized by a rifling twist of 1 in 7 or 1in 9.\nIt is late so tomorrow morning I will give greater details and formuleas', ''),

(103331, ' [quote=Gilani]Skeeter sahib has very elaborately covered various aspects related to mechanics of a handgun that enhance accuracy or otherwise. Just thought that discussion was getting too gun mechanics oriented so let''s discuss the subject from a slightly different angle. IMHO, generally speaking, inaccuracy in handgun fire is more because of the firer''s faults than the faulty construction of gun parts. Precision comes one we do the basics right :)  [/quote]\n\nBro Gilani Sahab, I completely agree with you that one''s technique, more often than the mechanics of the gun are responsible for good or poor shooting. This thread is leaning heavily towards the mechanics/design/construction of handguns and I feel that is a relevant excellent resource on its own. Comments on shooting technique are missing here, true. Most respectfully, I feel that it will be beneficial (especially to a newbie like me) if there is an entirely separate thread dedicated to marksmanship and shooting techniques and best practices. It deserves a topic on it own which is not limited to handguns only. Very humbly, the way I see it, three threads might be useful to capture relevant info per thread:\n\n1- One dealing with handgun construction and mechanics (ie the current one. Brothers'' insights, experience and QA on just this will make it a hefty enough specialized topic)\n2- Marksmanship, techniques, best practices (which is not limited to handguns, but includes rifles, shotguns)\n3- Actual shooting data and comments on accuracy of specific handguns (and riles, SG separately), on which you already have a most excellent thread going\n\n[quote=Gilani]Why I am harping upon the same thing again and again. The only reason is that I know many of us do not get sufficient opportunity to improve our shooting skill. Mainly due to paucity of shooting ranges and partly due to price of ammo, we end up firing far less than what is required to become an accurate shot. In this environment, we must try to gain maximum benefit from our limited shooting practices and therefore, beginners or mediocre shooters are advised to concentrate on improving their basic shooting skills if they do not shoot very often. Advanced shooting drills, rapid fire drills etc look very fascinating / thrilling but mostly consume lot of ammo and their practice would be counter productive anyway if someone is weak in basic skills like say trigger control. Experienced shooters, however, may concentrate on any kind of drills they deem appropriate. \nThanks and regards[/quote]\n\n100% agreed. And lack of available resources will continue to be a challenge. I so hope that PakGuns gtgs would be more frequent and could be organized at places (at privately owned lands etc, if not ranges) where there can be observed practice. An experienced shooter introduces and explains particular concepts of shooting of the day. Demonstrates. Others practice and he offers advice. And this is at least part of the agenda of the day. There seems to be a wealth of knowledge and experience here just waiting to be tapped into.', ''),

(103358, ' @Gillani sb, your articles and the information you impart is by far the most knowledgeable part i find on this forum. As i said before my disagreement with Mr. Antharax''s method was just my own opinion. I have met people who in a SD situation have neither double tapped nor shot precisely, instead they bombarded their openent emptying their the whole mag in a matter of seconds. with similar results..NG victorious..BG dead. I have had the oppurtunity to practice firing with Maj Badar on his own range, and i did that keeping in mind that if ur cornered in a city like karachi, there are more than one assailent. in such a situation if u start double tapping, your actually focusing your attention on on oppenent. For that Maj Badar taught me the method (dont know what it is called) using a single shot, focusing on where to shoot, without actually aligning the sights. In the start i had a great deal of diffculity...but as i progressed, it was much easier and more practical. but ofcouse for that you have to be very focused and you have to be very well aquainted with the weapon you are using. At that time it was a .32 CZ 83 for me. So double tapping when you are in a situation like when you are being mugged on the streets of karachi or if you have a couple of intruders in your house, is a big NO NO.', ''),

Different situations demand different types of firing techniques hence different types of shooting drills are practiced. Adoption of a particular drill also depends on shooter''s preference as to how he delivers the best and the capability of a particular handgun. \n\nThat is why you would have noticed that I have not advocated this or that shooting drill in any post. What I am saying is that if a firer has command over the basics of handgun shooting, learning this or that or so & so drill is no problem and will take very less time, provided a shooter practices regularly. However, resorting to these drills without having mastered the basics of handgun shooting will mostly result in a counter productive effort.     \n\nPersonally speaking, I would prefer a quick aimed single shot over an un-aimed double tap in most cases.  :)', ''),

Two backup magz with 18 FMJs each are available but in the car which is 50 yards away.\n\n8) You tend to keep yourself and your thought-process under control during high-stress situations.\n\n9) There is nothing between you and the BGs to take cover (hide behind).

AT 10 or so yards, i would pull out my weapon take a shot at the one who is already armed (given i have a practice of taking rapid headshots on the first shot with a .32, the first shot from a 9mm would have the same result). the next three or four shots would be randomly shot at both the other assailents not to give them time to arms themselves or be in a position to fire straight or aim at me, during which i would move circularly towards them, and in a position to fire more precisely. Running towards the car to get the backup mags would be a certain NO NO.[/b]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWould the answers change if ANY of the following variables are changed and if yes, please also comment on that:\n\n1) 3.5" barrel .45 instead of 5" barrel 9mm with only 9 rounds loaded with one backup mag with another 9 rounds in pocket. \n\n2) 10 yards distance between you and BG instead of 20 yards\n\n3) All three BGs have guns drawn, but not pointing at you.\n\n4) All three BGs have guns drawn AND pointing at you.\n\n5) There are 5 BGs instead of 3.[/quote]', ''),

As i said before my disagreement with Mr. Antharax''s method was just my own opinion. I have met people who in a SD situation have neither double tapped nor shot precisely, instead they bombarded their openent emptying their the whole mag in a matter of seconds. with similar results..NG victorious..BG dead. I have had the oppurtunity to practice firing with Maj Badar on his own range, and i did that keeping in mind that if ur cornered in a city like karachi, there are more than one assailent. in such a situation if u start double tapping, your actually focusing your attention on on oppenent. For that Maj Badar taught me the method (dont know what it is called) using a single shot, focusing on where to shoot, without actually aligning the sights. In the start i had a great deal of diffculity...but as i progressed, it was much easier and more practical. but ofcouse for that you have to be very focused and you have to be very well aquainted with the weapon you are using. At that time it was a .32 CZ 83 for me. So double tapping when you are in a situation like when you are being mugged on the streets of karachi or if you have a couple of intruders in your house, is a big NO NO.[/quote]\n\nFahadKahlid Sahab\n\nVery interesting discussion. I wish to know the distance at which the 5 shots were taken from  the hip and the time in which the 5 shots were fired.

(103486, ' Ok, so far so good! Lots of amazing information, and great to see people share their opinions. \n\nThe point and purpose of this thread was to initiate something other than stationary shooting to score points.\nThe purpose was to initiate a thread to learn and gain knowledge about an exercise in which one''s rapid response in a stressful situation, both mental and physical, comes into play. The "Mozambique Drill" (What I''ve tried to replicate here) is taught by LEA''s all over the world. Discarding it completely is a bit ridiculous. \n\nFor example, a person who is used to shooting at a competition target, is leaning more towards competitive shooting. But how does that practice and usage of ammo helps that person in a SD situation? How does that effect their mental alertness and drawing skills, if his/her life is threatened? No matter how many times a person goes through a certain amount of SD training, at the end of the day, they are at the mercy of circumstances and luck. But that doesn''t mean that one shouldn''t fully prepare themselves, does it? \n\nWhat''s the definition of double tap? " a shooting technique where two well-aimed shots are fired at the same target with very little time in between shots. " That doesn''t necessarily means that one can''t make use of double taps from waist height. WHY waist height? Because as I said in my first post, the double tap is to stun your enemy from a VERY close range, not more than 5-10 meters, which also ensures (After a little practice) that you don''t end up firing everywhere like a maniac. Controlled pair of shots to stun the enemy at a close distance is effective, and that''s where your third shot comes into play. The "Mozambique Drill" is a very useful tactic if used properly. People have been saying that "I''d rather take one well aimed shot than three shots" .... \n\nWell, if that''s the case, then I suppose that person draws his weapon, aligns his arms, looks down his sights, acquires the target, and then pulls the trigger, ALL in the heat of the moment when his life depends on it. On the other hand, when controlling your shots from waist height, one can effectively make use of their two shots in a split second in very less time, and after successfully wounding/stunning your enemy, you''ll have all the time you need to take the last and final decisive shot. (Only if the threat is not more than 5 to 10 meters away from you)\n\nAbout the points raised about going backwards, well, I have a question: [b]If a guy pulls a gun at you in a confined space or alley at 5-10 feet, are you going to move TOWARDS Him?[/b] Unless you''re planning to feel how cold his gun barrel feels against your chest, moving towards him is a BIG NO! Or if you could magically walk through walls, at that point in time, one can definitely go RIGHT through the wall by moving to the left. Basically, Hope for the best but DON''T forget to prepare for the worst. \n\nAnyway, we''ve got a LOT of theories here along with SD methods and techniques. I''d definitely love to see some of them in "Action" for the benefit of all of us. Any volunteers? :)', ''),

(103512, ' [quote=Anthrax]Ok, so far so good! Lots of amazing information, and great to see people share their opinions. \n\nThe point and purpose of this thread was to initiate something other than stationary shooting to score points.\nThe purpose was to initiate a thread to learn and gain knowledge about an exercise in which one''s rapid response in a stressful situation, both mental and physical, comes into play. The "Mozambique Drill" (What I''ve tried to replicate here) is taught by LEA''s all over the world. Discarding it completely is a bit ridiculous. \n\nFor example, a person who is used to shooting at a competition target, is leaning more towards competitive shooting. But how does that practice and usage of ammo helps that person in a SD situation? How does that effect their mental alertness and drawing skills, if his/her life is threatened? No matter how many times a person goes through a certain amount of SD training, at the end of the day, they are at the mercy of circumstances and luck. But that doesn''t mean that one shouldn''t fully prepare themselves, does it? \n\nWhat''s the definition of double tap? " a shooting technique where two well-aimed shots are fired at the same target with very little time in between shots. " That doesn''t necessarily means that one can''t make use of double taps from waist height. WHY waist height? Because as I said in my first post, the double tap is to stun your enemy from a VERY close range, not more than 5-10 meters, which also ensures (After a little practice) that you don''t end up firing everywhere like a maniac. Controlled pair of shots to stun the enemy at a close distance is effective, and that''s where your third shot comes into play. The "Mozambique Drill" is a very useful tactic if used properly. People have been saying that "I''d rather take one well aimed shot than three shots" .... \n\nWell, if that''s the case, then I suppose that person draws his weapon, aligns his arms, looks down his sights, acquires the target, and then pulls the trigger, ALL in the heat of the moment when his life depends on it. On the other hand, when controlling your shots from waist height, one can effectively make use of their two shots in a split second in very less time, and after successfully wounding/stunning your enemy, you''ll have all the time you need to take the last and final decisive shot. (Only if the threat is not more than 5 to 10 meters away from you)\n\nAbout the points raised about going backwards, well, I have a question: [b]If a guy pulls a gun at you in a confined space or alley at 5-10 feet, are you going to move TOWARDS Him?[/b] Unless you''re planning to feel how cold his gun barrel feels against your chest, moving towards him is a BIG NO! Or if you could magically walk through walls, at that point in time, one can definitely go RIGHT through the wall by moving to the left. Basically, Hope for the best but DON''T forget to prepare for the worst. \n\nAnyway, we''ve got a LOT of theories here along with SD methods and techniques. I''d definitely love to see some of them in "Action" for the benefit of all of us. Any volunteers? :)[/quote]\n\n\nGood point raised by Mr Antharax regarding the faceoff in a confined space. If you are in a confined space or an alley, at 5-7 feet, in such a case i normally have my hand on my gun, the holestor top open, and in my mind, i am ready to shoot as soon as my weapon is out and facing the BG. meaning next time you are on the range try this. Stand in front of a target at 5-7 feet, draw ur weapon and as quickly as possible shoot the first round in the torso, keep ur hands steady, dont roll ur wrist, as the gun recoils fire anther round, and then using the recoil of the 2nd round fire a third one. Wen i tried this on a manequinn, my first shot hit the lady (i got it from a ladies boutique ;) ) on the lower ribs, the second was in the in the lower part of her (please excuse this word) right breast and the third hit her in the neck. do not let the gun come back to the orginal place. in the start its nerve racking bur i am those of you who try this will be amazed with the results.', ''),

I think Laser for self defense is just one of the Hollywood fantasy, if and only if I have to use some accessory in dark then I will only use red dot (non reflective) which won''t disclose my position. But again my all time preference will be night sights. IN dark encounter keep yourself invisible or not to be located by the offender is a big plus. As the offender will also try to hide him and attack when he gets the clear shot. And attaching a laser or tactical light doesnât give you an immediate night vision capability but it gives away your position and if the offender is hiding he will take advantage and will shoot you from a hiding position with his simple gun even before you point your laser or light to him for getting a proper shot.\n\nIncase the offender and the defender both are visible to each other in dark or low light then the good placement and quick reaction is all you need. \n\n \n[b]Laser and Tactical Light for Law Enforcement Agencies:[/b]\n\nThe Tactical Light and Lasers are mostly used by the [b]LEs or MOSTLY by SWAT teams[/b].

Most of the government or police officers [b](MOSTLY)[/b] they do not use tactical light or lasers.

My bad, the session could not extend as I mentioned we had to move out early due to reasons.\n\nFeeding firing and ejection was flawless and without any sort of malfunctions. Firing pin intendations on primers were centered and consistent. Ejection of spent casings was very consistent that it later occured to me all the casing were lying on the ground piled in the same spot. Upon firing the 809 muzzle flip is greater than 92 clone due to lesser wait but felt recoil was surprisingly minute. I think it is due to polymer frame and grip that pistol seems to kick a lot lesser in hands. \n\nI was firing after a long period of a little more than 3 months now and more over pistol is new to me out of the box so couldnt stoke it to max but it has the potential no doubt. The consistency in accuracy (all my fault btw) story would change drastically once I get through another 100 rounds.\nPistol shot 10 O'' clock 1" higher and 2" off to left of the bulls eye. My current grip and trigger technique favors the idea to move my rear sight(drift adjustment) a bit to right few micro mm''s and point of impact will be minus 2" right on the line crossing bullseye. I was currently using Hold Over technique in sight picture. Considering the shots impact bit higher I have decided to use 6 O'' clock hold for the next time to bring POI down by 1". I hope to print on the bulls eye next time. :)\n\n[b]Target Pics:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsKfN1A][img]http://s2.postimage.org/KfN1A.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 8 rounds, 6 rounds in under 3" group @ 15 meters with 2 fliers due to variation in my technique. That is why it is said practice is the most important.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsKfS0S][img]http://s2.postimage.org/KfS0S.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 10 rounds @ 15 meters, 8 rounds again in under 3" group with 2 fliers.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsKfUw0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/KfUw0.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 4 rounds @ 15 meters, 3 impacts in 1.5" group with 1 flier.\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsKfZvi][img]http://s2.postimage.org/KfZvi.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: The lacquer coated green steel spent casings from Russian Ulyanovsk Cartridge Plant. You can see the primer indentations consistent and centered. This ammo is not a HOT AMMO like POF Mk/PIIz. Even chinese ammo is more hotter than this stuff. I could easily verify it by the kick and muzzle blast as I dont wear ear plugs during shooting 9mm'' handguns.', ''),

Starting from the ready position whereby the hand is at 45 degrees. The targets are 25 meters range. \nNo body can or in his right mind shoot a pistol from the hip at a range of more than 3 meters. \nCombat shooting is a different ball game and I with the help of Muneer Sahab, HJ , Abbas and Gillani post some videos of combat shooting practices.

The problem only arises when there is an extreme change. Like a 50 or 55 grain 5.56 bullet stabilised with a 1 in 12 twist , but when they changed to the 62 grain bullet the rifling had to be changed to 1 in 7, 1 in 8 etc.\nThe rifling rate of twist has to do with the length of the projectile  measured in calibers. The heavier the bullet for a  given caliber the longer it will be. The more sharp rifling twist a longer bullet will require to stabilize.  There is much more to it and if you digest this and ask for more explanations I am at your service.', ''),

But do keep in mind that unless the gun is handled by human it does not become a weapon. The greatest weapon in the world is the human being himself. i would suggest that people also go through a bit of close range hand to hand combat training also. At close range the biggest element of surprise to a BG is when to try to disarm him barehanded. i had the privilige of having a bit of this training and have put it to use a couple of times, though the oponents carried knives rather than guns, but it proved very effective. I am sure Mr Vik would be able to shed some more light on the subject since he has a military background.

(103620, ' Hare is the most recent on the list of animals to be banned for law abiding hunters. However. this has actually increased the number of hares being killed, as they shot from motorbikes by poachers, and trapped with nets by trappers. \n\nPunjab took the lead in banning hare hunting, on the insistence of a certain person who was appointed chief whip of the wildlife department there. This person is also very fond of keeping dogs for hunting hare and wildboar. Taking cue from him, his equally enthusiastic and infleuntial hare coursing friend in Sindh got hare hunting banned here as well. \n\nSuch discriminatory bans, apart from stoking an individual''s ego, have little benefit for the species involved.

But do keep in mind that unless the gun is handled by human it does not become a weapon. The greatest weapon in the world is the human being himself. i would suggest that people also go through a bit of close range hand to hand combat training also. At close range the biggest element of surprise to a BG is when to try to disarm him barehanded. i had the privilige of having a bit of this training and have put it to use a couple of times, though the oponents carried knives rather than guns, but it proved very effective. I am sure Mr Vik would be able to shed some more light on the subject since he has a military background. Mostly we treat ourselves as tools and our guns as weapons, whereas in truth, its us who are the weapons and our guns merely tools.[/quote]\n\nAoa \nKia. What made you think i am in the forces.

Now if only they made tables for conceal and carry, we''d eliminate every threat infront of us in a second. :lol: Except for getting familiar with his Handgun and his weapon''s line of sight and fire, how does he manage to pull of a quick draw while moving, taking aim of a moving target, and doing all that in a situation where one''s rapid action techniques can save a persons life? One can''t learn all this by standing infront of a target all day scoring points. Extra measures should be taken to ensure that if in a life or death situation, one''s prepared for the worst. \n\nWe don''t have Institutes that can teach us these things like the western world but we can at least try to explore the "Survival" side of our hobby. I''m not saying that one shouldn''t shoot numerical targets, everyone should to learn the basics of a Hadgun, but we shouldn''t leave it at that.

This is done to prevent reflection of the spot light on the eyepiece which washes out every thing. Zero your Revolver to shoot dead on at 25m and it will be shooting about 2 inches high at 50 meters due to the scope height and will be about 2 inches low at hundred meters depending on what ammo you are using. Try to shoot just behind the shoulder in the rib cage to puncture both lungs and it will not go far  ( if it offers a broad side ) otherwise angling shots can be worked out.\nTry a 44 magnum with 240 gr or 300 gr bullets, and a 357 with 158 grain bullets reloaders can use 180 for 357 the heavier bullets ensure penetration on bigger boars.

I will say this for sure that  it was probably the only cherry popping event that even had three witnesses to it. hahahahaha.\n\nas far as the copper grease is concerned, well, the one that you see on a virgin Glock is not a copper grease. its just copper colored. I dont see a reason why glock would use real copper grease unless they are expecting the thing to seize. thats the true purpose of a copper grease. its not for lubrication. it is designed to prevent seizure of nuts and bolts.\n\nsince Glock recommends that a user should break-in the gun with this grease on. I''m guessing it must be a metallic soap grease, could be aluminum oxide or could be plain lithium with some kind of additive added to it that makes it look copperish.\n\nanother way to look at it that copper grease is never recommended for steel-on-steel contact. its pointless in my opinion even to try. copper is a much softer metal to be of any use when hard surfaces are involved.\n\nanyways, the best thing about this copper colored grease is that it looked as if applied with some sort of a precision applicator and it wasn''t even smudged which shows that even the slide wasn''t racked after application. another point that tells that this truly was a virgin piece.\n\nanyways, enjoy long and safe shooting with your KK. :)\n\nRegards.', ''),

In all tactical shooting competitions, gun is in the holster and not on the table and shooter has little time to aim, shoot and move on to the next target. [/quote]\n\nBefore discussing this further, first let me establish that I''m talking about the shooting practiced in Pakistan, not anywhere else in the world. So basically we have to keep that view in mind. Moving on to your point, Yes, I agree that there are different kinds of competitive shootings practiced in Pakistan. But even then, Tactical shooting is never a part of it. I must have been missing something so you can enlighten me on that but from what I''ve observed, in our society, the sport of shooting when it comes to handguns is quite limited. All the Gun Ranges in Pakistan have strict rules and since I''ve witnessed stories about the Lahore one, one can''t even shoot in a rapid mode. How can a person adopt the "Tactical" approach while being at a range in Pakistan? And I''m not talking about private lands because not all the people are privileged to practice shooting, privately. \n\n[quote]If you have personal knowledge of some bulls eye shooter who was good at scoring points all day while standing infront of a paper target but was not proficient at drawing his gun from the holster and releasing a reasonably accurate aimed shot in quick time, than this is a different matter and akin to that shooter only. However, if the above remarks are meant to be generalised remarks for all competitive shooters than I would say that they are based on an assumption as well as gross underestimation of the capabilities of competitive shooters. How has this been assumed that competitive shooters don''t practice such basic things as drawing the gun from the holster and shooting in quick time?[/quote]\n\nWhen we talk about competitive shooting, it''s not just limited to the people who participate in National tournaments. We have another class of people as well who''re also part of this genre simply because anyone who practices his shooting skill by firing at a numerical target, is basically aiming to shoot like a competitor. When scoring is involved, it automatically converts into a sport. But since we''re talking about Pakistan, please tell me how many threads related to tactical shooting have been opened since the conception of this forum? None. Reason? Because it doesn''t exist. We''re used to the competition side of this hobby, not survival and tactical shooting. What''s worse is that there aren''t any institutes who''re willing to share these life saving techniques with the common man. And that''s my point: When such an ideology doesn''t even exist in the first place, how can you argue that the average joe from the range is well trained to counter life threatening events? \n       \n\n[quote=Gilani]\n:rolleyes: Don''t understand what it means and on whom it is aimed? [/quote]\n\nThat was suppose to be a joke. :lol:\n\n\n[quote=Gilani] \nAgain, it has been assumed that a competitive shooter would somehow overlook these important aspects. [/quote]\n\nIt HAS been assumed because the Army is capable of providing you with a electronic CQC target room, but not to the average Joe. Exactly why almost no one here has shared any personal experience with us related to moving shooting at moving targets. \n\n\n\n[quote=Gilani]\nSure, no one stops us from doing this and  I fully appreciate your efforts in this regard. At least I stand more educated on the subject after going through this thread. [/quote]\n\nThat''s why we''re here. To take this hobby to a newer level where it doesn''t become just a Sunday afternoon entertainment.\n\n[quote=Gilani] \nIf it is written in any competitive shooting manual that a competitive shooter should just do competitive shooting practice and should not try to learn or practice new techniques, specially with regard to SD; then I strongly disagree with it. However, I haven''t seen such an advise anywhere. [/quote]\n\nI strongly disagree with that approach as well.

One should definitely first learn the very basics of handgun shooting before moving on to such drills and exercises. But at the end of the day, if one''s keeping a weapon for SD, his focus should be more on the "Survival" trainings and Tactical shooting instead of scoring points. \n\nOur people buy new weapons and with their very first weapon, they prefer to keep on shooting for fun when in reality, the reason why they bought the weapon in the first place was for SD. I have a strong disagreement with such ideology and that''s why I''m a vocal supporter of practicing tactical drills (Only if they''re well aware of their weapon''s potential) which may one day save somebody''s life. Even if somebody is well experienced with their weapon, they continue to stick to one side of shooting which isn''t genuinely supposed to train one''s mind and body for stressful and life threatening situations. \n\nRegards', ''),

Second event was 5 bullets at plates with 10 points each \nour fellow brother [b]MOEEN secured 2nd position on targets and 3rd in plates [/b] . Congratulations to him ( he will post pictures of trophies. ) [b]I did not do so well was placed 4th in both events .[/b]\n\nIt was a fun day with great discussions with different gun enthusiasts .

However, I do believe that certain weapons DO increase ones chances of winning and in this case it was the Sig X5.  Thanks again.\n\n@Dr. Zakir - Boss, thanks for your support.  Without your push I would have never entered the competition.  It has infact been over twenty years since I competed.... and I was very nervous.... and came to a realization I AM old.\n\n@All - here are some pictures, yes AK47 they are not clear.  Glockcohlic will come and take the photos with his camera.  P.S.

(103867, ' @Anthrax\n\nthis is very good topic and I appreciate you for raising this issue and bringing this up for everybody''s attention.\n\n@Skeeter60 Sb and Gilani Sb.\n\nawesome and priceless information from both of you and I feel your contribution has made this thread even more inspiring.\n\nkindly allow me to offer my two cents on this issue:\n\n1. Aimed fire is the mother of all type of shooting and without being able to hit where required any effort where personal/home defense is involved is fruitless.\n\n2. next follows speed and ability to deliver as many shots as possible in as little time as possible.\n\n3. many studies have been conducted over the years by different armies around the globe (kindly google and confirm) and the single most important variable that determined which side won was the number of rounds fired against the constraint "time". the side which fired the maximum number of rounds in as little time frame as possible ended up victorious.\n\n4. another interesting aspect of the those studies was that accuracy had a much lower "coeficient" as compared to the "coeficient" of number of rounds fired. which clearly suggests that accuracy is less of a determining factor than number of rounds fired or higher rate of fire if you must maximize the equation with time as a constraint.\n\n5. if you look at the behavior patterns of armies around the world you''ll see after second world war, after conducting extensive testing, armies opted/employed less accurate assault rifles instead of more accurate full size battle rifles for the sake of higher rate of fire and ability to carry more ammunition. following the same variables that popped up during testing in US, Russia and Britain.\n\n6. so with that we have established two very important variables (in the order of preference), higher rate of fire and accuracy. the preference established after extensive testing.\n\n7. during FBI studies of criminal encounters, the maximum handgun encounters occurred within 15 yards and the results clearly suggested that handgun operator should be well versed in the usage at 15 yards. I dont exactly remember the number but it was something like 95% or more.\n\n8. so with that established, now our variables are higher rate of fire, accuracy and 15 yards distance.\n\nso keeping all above points in mind, I feel that one must start off by practicing slow aimed fire at stationary targets placed at multiple distances at 15 yards or less. once mastered, the user should move on to rapid fire keeping the accuracy maintained and the shedding the time second by second while maintaining the accuracy. with this approach, the user/operator is taking into consideration all the variables established through well known studies.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. or you can ignore what i''ve written all together, get your pump action out, load it up with with your favorite [b]00 buckshot[/b] and [b]BOOM SHAKALAKA![/b] :D', ''),

(103889, ' Dear All, last weekend I visited POF Skeet Club (SGC) at Wah. After firing a couple of magazines on target from my 9mm Norinko CF98 I returned to skeet site. Meanwhile, a guy came with KRAL repeater (Made in Turkey), collected a box and started skeet shooting. He was very good at hitting disks but his gun failed to fire every second and subsequent cartridges. When he come back, I conducted a brief chit chat and inspected his weapon. His gun was borrowed and was no properly lublicated. After first fire, bolt was held 1 cm aback and did not cock properly. I highlighted this issue. The guy was son of president of club and director of WIL. Meanwhile, his father arrived and after introduction,  revealed that [b]POF is going to launch its 9mm pistol in August 2010. Khalid Pervez was of the openion that this pistol is better than Glock & Beretta, weights around 1 kg, steel, and shall be launched in three flavours including regular, silver slide and third one engraved in gold. Launch price will be nearly PKR 80K[/b]. I argued alot on design, price and models. I told him that any price above 50k will be unacceptable to most of buyers. Reliability will be time tested after launch and you can not say anything right now. Weight is on the heavier side. I also suggested that an adjustible site version for target, laser railing, hi cap magazine and concealable layout/design is what market is seeking for in addition to reliability, accuracy and warrenty. I feel that their R & D is based upon misleading input from dealers trying to get distributorship and this is one reason of high pricing. POF/WIL is already known for its high pricing as compared to other markets and this is one cause of other organizations established their own production facilities. On pricing issue, he passed unacceptabel remarks that if people are buying beretta and glock why they will not buy POF. I think their major market focus is on security forces especially police purchases who have no issues wth price as it is from our precious tax money. Thanks', ''),

Who won the war?\nIs the M16 A2 more accurate or the Moisin Nagant (USSR), or The Arisaka (Japan ), or the Rifle No 4 Mk 1, or the M1 Garrand used by the US during the second WW.\nThe modern weapons are lighter, more accurate, and their ammo is also much lighter. Todays stress is on super accuracy, the infantry rifles are now smaller and lighter as now the infantry combat is to be fought in within 200 yds (except Snipers).At longer ranges the platoon and company heavy weapons take over. \nIn the second world war a 1000 artillery shells could not destroy a pin point target today it can be done by just 18 or 24 rds, then a 100 bombers dropping thousands of bombs  could not destroy a pin point target, to day only one Smart bomb will do it.

But if they design theirself a pistol and incorporate borrowed (best practices or looks from other manufecturers) design for each element, a "choon choon ka muraba" might not be as good as we think. Designing a weapon from scratch is like an innovation or art and work of creativity and workmanship. The examples are Browning and my favourite SIG P210. What if the production cost is 25,000 (eg), selling to distributor is 50,000 and to end user is 85,000; will it justify the price whatever charm the pistol may have? For export 100k+ is Ok, but for domestic market you know there are Stoeger Cougar and Taurus are biggest competitors in reliability, accuracy and price. The interesting remarks that if one can buy under over or repeater from beretta for around 3-4 lakh why cannot POF 9mm in 80+ is ridiculous as many of us love to get one at that price but could not afford.

(103930, ' I am glad this discussion is back on the educative path again :) \n\nSkeeter60 sahib and 12guage sahib have very elaborately covered the relevant aspects and have concluded that basic shooting skill (which is bulls eye shooting) is the mother of all shooting drills. Once we have achieved reasonable proficiency in the basic shooting drills only then we move on to the advance shooting drills. What drill to follow.............. well, sky is the limit. [b]There are hundreds of drills aimed at improving different aspects of self defence and offensive engagements but all of them point towards one single goal; the ability to deliver successfully when it matters[/b]. Missing any of these important aspects would result in insufficient skill level and incomplete knowledge of the subject. For example, shooting skills of a bulls eye shooter who does not practice self defence drills despite having the opportunity would always remain incomplete and would not be of great practical use. Similarly, a new shooter resorting to advanced shooting skills right at the start without having achieve sufficient mastery over basic bulls eye shooting skills would also not gain much and would end up wasting lot of ammo. Both techniques are important and both must be practiced.   \n\n\nBrother 12guage has given few very interesting observations which have added to the dimensions of the discussion and have made it more educative. While I fully agree with most part of his argument, I would like to give my views on one issue, ie, Importance of Accuracy vs Volume of Fire in quick time. Skeeter60 sahib has already given his very valuable input on the issue but I would also like to comment from a different angle ................... the purpose is to share our knowledge and learn from each other and certainly not to prove other person wrong. :)\n\n[quote=12gauge]\n3. many studies have been conducted over the years by different armies around the globe (kindly google and confirm) and the single most important variable that determined which side won was the number of rounds fired against the constraint "time". the side which fired the maximum number of rounds in as little time frame as possible ended up victorious. \n\n4. another interesting aspect of the those studies was that accuracy had a much lower "coeficient" as compared to the "coeficient" of number of rounds fired. which clearly suggests that accuracy is less of a determining factor than number of rounds fired or higher rate of fire if you must maximize the equation with time as a constraint.\n[/quote]\nSir, I would approach this argument from another angle. In my humble view the reference here is of artillery fire and not small arms fire. With artillery, rocket fire or other such area weapons, which are mostly indirect firing weapons (means the target is not visible from the weapon at the time of firing), armies used to aim at causing devastation of the area and to harass  the enemy, resulting in demoralization and destruction of enemy troops. In such an engagement, firing more rounds in less time brought better results because even if the round would land 100 M away from the intended target, it would explode and would cause some damage or destruction to enemy in the battlefield. More number of rounds in less time would not only cover the area occupied by the enemy but would give him little chance to react. Hence the army which fired more generally ended up winning a battle, but not always. I have used past tense in the above argument because we don''t see this trend exactly in the same form in the recent wars like Gulf War, US invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. [b]Nowadays, even with indirect firing weapons, the emphasis is on greater accuracy, more lethality and destruction of target with minimum possible number of hits [/b](simply because modern precision munitions are very very expensive and secondly when a weapon platform fires, it also reveals its position to opposing weapon systems and electronic instruments thereby giving them a chance to engage it, if it misses the target).  Therefore, in modern warfare, its SHOOT TO KILL OR GET KILLED YOURSELF. \n\n[b]Aimed fire or small arms fire or infantry fire, however, has always been different.[/b] Here, a soldier would only achieve results if he hits a target. If he misses a target, he misses it and the bullet hitting the ground behind the target would not explode like an artillery round. In few instances, a ricochet bullet might hit some other target but in most cases, it would be a waste. So firing a large number of bullets would not guarantee desired results if those bullets were not fired with accuracy. Skeeter sahib has given a very relevant example of Vietcong to illustrate this point. [b]In aimed fire therefore, all armies emphasise on accuracy which is demonstrated by commonly known army idioms like ''Shoot to kill'' or ''First Shot Kill'' etc etc. All army drills therefore aim at achieving perfection in first shot kill [/b] \n\nThe modern trends in weapon development, therefore, have all the emphasis on achieving more and more accuracy and the ability to cause maximum destruction to the target (lethality) with minimum possible engagements. May it be missiles, artillery guns, rockets, mortars, air platforms, machine guns, assault rifles or handguns, achieving sure first hit capability and destruction / neutralisation of the target is the aim.  \n\nI would terminate the argument here because the purpose of this thread is SD / CQC drills and not military warfare which is altogether a different and a very wast subject. [b] I would however submit that IMHO, dynamics of a SD combat between two or more individuals and a war between two armies on a battlefield are absolutely different and can not be compared. Lessons of one are generally not applicable to the other. [/b]\n\nLastly, I would say that despite my difference of opinion on certain issues with brother Anthrax, I give him full credit for starting an excellent thread which has added immensely to my understanding of the subject. Such a thread was badly needed I believe. Soon, we would see some tangible CQC input in this thread from some of our most experienced members :)\n\nThanks are regards', ''),

I said the coefficient of accuracy was less than the number of rounds fired. I never said that it was zero. meaning that higher rate of fire can only be effective if its accurate.\n\neven though I was never good in translating mathematics into English by i''ll try it anyways.\n\n"the objective is to fire as many rounds in as little time as possible while maintaining the minimum level of acceptable accuracy instead of firing as accurately as you possibly can while keeping a higher rate of fire"\n\nRegards.', ''),

(104005, ' @Bloodbath,\nSir i have to say that one must agree with you on this one. I have also heard some bad repo about the MP-5 but not about other weapons the POF makes. Also there are so many MP-5 fans out there that one cannot say anything bad about it. In my experience whenever i say something bad about the MP-5 infront of someone who is harping about its quality, they immediately go into denial and look at me as if saying "What the hell do you know about guns" :o , So i try to stay quiet when ever someone is admiring the MP-5.\n\nRegarding the POF 9mm pistol..... It is truly a dissappointment to read the truth. Although POF has every sort of CNC machines at their disposal but still they produce something of this quality........ very sad indeed.\n\nBTW ive heard a lot about you form Mangloo bhai :)', ''),

Our long telephonic discussion revealed that we both were actually talking the same thing. If one can fire aimed shots at high speed on more than one target while still maintaining bare minimum level of accuracy desired to engage those particular targets (this will differ from target to target), it is an ideal combination and can only be achieved after lots and lots of practice :)', ''),

(104015, ' @Nabeel:\n\nBrother you have selected a very nice gun for SD/HD...first of all make sure its new NIB...\nTry it in your hands whether it fits your hands better or not..then strip it open and look through into the internals throughly..see for any flaws..tell the dealer to show you two or three more pieces so that you should not confy yourself to only one piece..\n\nNow check the barrel thoroughly specially its rifling..now again reassemble it..watch for the frame to slide fitness..agood frame to slide fitness is very good. Now rack/pull the slide a few times so the hammer is in cocked position. Now push the decocker downward and you will see that the hammer become decocked. \n\nAnother thing to do is to squeeze the trigger like you do in double action, the hammer will be decocked. Don''t remove your finger from the pulled trigger and at the same time apply presure on the hammer..the hammer will be toughing the firing pin. Now release your finger from the trigger and again press the hammer. This time the hammer will have no contact with the firing pin, still if you apply force on the hammer, this is drop safety.So whenever the handgun drop it will not fire\n \nAnother safety is within the handgun which is called firing pin safety...unless the trigger is pulled fully backward the firing pin safety mechanism will prevent the firing pin in contact with the round in the chamber, untill the trigger is pulled to its extreme rearward  position hope you got my point.\n\nLets hope you get my point.\nRegards.', ''),

(104020, ' [quote=12gauge]@Anthrax\n\nthis is very good topic and I appreciate you for raising this issue and bringing this up for everybody''s attention.\n\n@Skeeter60 Sb and Gilani Sb.\n\nawesome and priceless information from both of you and I feel your contribution has made this thread even more inspiring.\n\nkindly allow me to offer my two cents on this issue:\n\n1. Aimed fire is the mother of all type of shooting and without being able to hit where required any effort where personal/home defense is involved is fruitless.\n\n2. next follows speed and ability to deliver as many shots as possible in as little time as possible.\n\n3. many studies have been conducted over the years by different armies around the globe (kindly google and confirm) and the single most important variable that determined which side won was the number of rounds fired against the constraint "time". the side which fired the maximum number of rounds in as little time frame as possible ended up victorious.\n\n4. another interesting aspect of the those studies was that accuracy had a much lower "coeficient" as compared to the "coeficient" of number of rounds fired. which clearly suggests that accuracy is less of a determining factor than number of rounds fired or higher rate of fire if you must maximize the equation with time as a constraint.\n\n5. if you look at the behavior patterns of armies around the world you''ll see after second world war, after conducting extensive testing, armies opted/employed less accurate assault rifles instead of more accurate full size battle rifles for the sake of higher rate of fire and ability to carry more ammunition. following the same variables that popped up during testing in US, Russia and Britain.\n\n6. so with that we have established two very important variables (in the order of preference), higher rate of fire and accuracy. the preference established after extensive testing.\n\n7. during FBI studies of criminal encounters, the maximum handgun encounters occurred within 15 yards and the results clearly suggested that handgun operator should be well versed in the usage at 15 yards. I dont exactly remember the number but it was something like 95% or more.\n\n8. so with that established, now our variables are higher rate of fire, accuracy and 15 yards distance.\n\nso keeping all above points in mind, I feel that one must start off by practicing slow aimed fire at stationary targets placed at multiple distances at 15 yards or less. once mastered, the user should move on to rapid fire keeping the accuracy maintained and the shedding the time second by second while maintaining the accuracy. with this approach, the user/operator is taking into consideration all the variables established through well known studies.\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. or you can ignore what i''ve written all together, get your pump action out, load it up with with your favorite [b]00 buckshot[/b] and [b]BOOM SHAKALAKA![/b] :D[/quote]\n\nAoa\nI don''t know much about shotguns.

(104049, ' How could I remain silent when I prefer to choose 303 as my nick. I have fired it, owned it and modified it for use with telescope. Later I found out that original mounts for telescope were available on the internet. I selected my 303 with care. There are two versions as discussed by Skeeter60, which I owned. First the smaller rifle which is suitable for para drops. Next is the standard rifle with a long barrel, which came to me brand new. My shooting with the scope gave me a lot of pleasure. I mounted a Weaver 3-9X 40mm scope on it and had some classic shots, including a wait for two wild boars to get in line, and dropping both in one shot stone dead. The bullet went through the chest of the first, entered the chest of the second boar, and ricocheted against the backbone, going up with the pinnâ¦gggg familiarly heard after ricochet.  The heavy recoil tempted me to flinch. So I ultimately decided to go for a lighter rifle with low recoil, and moved over to 7 x 57.\n	I had accumulated a lot of ammunition for 303. Now the rifle, with base for telescope and modified cheek rest, and ammunition is available with an arms dealer in Lahore, at a very modest price.', ''),

You would be (if you have good nerves) calm and determinded to kill them or die fighting.\n\n2) You face of against a couple of BGs, you have your family with you. The BGs are showing a clear intent of destruction. No matter how strong your nerves, you would want just about enough firing to get away and get your family out of harms way.\n\nHow we react in an SD situation is not just about our training. It also has alot to do with the circumstances that we are in at the time. The cops are trained and is their duty to stand in the line of fire, but do remember one thing, the people they got shot by, may have killed a dozen people before. and no amount of training can actually train you to actually take a persons life. Range firing and actually shooting someone to take their lives are two totally seprate issues. The interviews conducted on the wounded cops, did they also mention how long they had been on the force or how many gun fights they had been in or for that matter how many BGs they actually had killed? I dont think so. So practice as many drills you want, score as many bullseyes as you like, but do pray you never have to put those practices to test.

(104095, ' For the info, the gun we know as the [b]Springfield Armory XD[/b] (or XDM) is originally a Croatian pistol, known as the HS2000. SA makes these pistols on license from the original Croatian manufacturer, and I believe it adds a  few additional features to the original design.\n\nMany have commented that this gun has a grip angle mimicking that of the CZ-75, which makes it (for some) more comfortable to hold and shoot than the Glock.\n\nThe XD (or HS2000) contains 3 primary safeties: a drop safety, trigger safety (similar to Glock) and grip safety (similar to M1911). Recent models, particularly those from the SA Custom Shop also feature a manual thumb safety, upon request.\n\nIf the guns arriving soon sport Springfield Armory marks, I believe they will sell for higher simply because they are "American". On the other hand, if the Croatian HS2000 is imported, it (hopefully) will have a lower price tag, while still delivering a performance similar to the aforementioned SA XD.\n\nIf its under the 100k bracket.... that would add another to the growing numbers of combat pistols in that particular budget range.', ''),

Even the ideology, on which the vision is based, could be totally screwed up and even then, if the vision itself is clear and the determined efforts are made, the vision can still be achieved, no matter how evil or wrong the results are.\n\nSo one doesn''t necessarily need to be ''honest'' or ''Muslim'' to have a ''clear'' vision.\n\nVisioning is a different process altogether.

I dont want to get into the engineering details but removing choke tube will actually make it more open than a cylinder choke, causing the pellets to spread more quickly than required.\n\nif you want to make your shotgun cylinder, u should install a cylinder choke provided with the shotgun. some russian shotguns are not provided with cylinder chokes but they are available in the market at a price range of 3-5K per choke tube.\n\none more thing to add, prefered choke for patridges is IC (improved cylinder).\n\nRegards.', ''),

Vision is not a product of honesty. Even a dishonest and corrupt person can have a clear vision and chalk out a well-defined and laid-out plan to achieve dishonest ambitions/goals. Even the ideology, on which the vision is based, could be totally screwed up and even then, if the vision itself is clear and the determined efforts are made, the vision can still be achieved, no matter how evil or wrong the results are.\n\nSo one doesn''t necessarily need to be ''honest'' or ''Muslim'' to have a ''clear'' vision.\n\nVisioning is a different process altogether.

However, the nearest modest range to Peshawar is the Islamabad Gun Club, which also happens to be one of the most expensive as far as membership is concerned. It is sad to see that with so many gun lovers and with such a large market in Peshawar and the Khyber Pukhtunkhwa in general, we still don''t have a good shooting club where members from Peshawar and neighbouring cities can practice in a decent, friendly, resourceful and safe environment. It is very difficult to maintain regular practice without such a facility. Practicing at one private pseudo range or the other doesn''t make anyone''s life any easier.

I also know some people who actually want to develop a sound national shooting team... so the interest is surely there.

(104505, ' [quote=MKKD]Hmmm in that case Sir jee I will first try and redo two tests (for the Baikal MP446 and Taurus PT99/92) both with the hand rests and using your method. That way we can compare results of two different guns of the same make and model and also test the hand rest theory... If it works, I strongly [b]suggest [/b] that we shift the method to that, it will be more revealing about the guns... and the next time you''re on the range brother please do try a few shots with the hand rest as well... Making this suggestion purely in the interest of contributing to the activity you''ve initiated!\n\nWill try to get back with some field reports as soon as possible...[/quote]\nI would highly appreciate if you do that. I have been urging others to post the results of the handguns that they possess but so far no one else has posted his results. Please ensure you follow the same standards that have been mentioned in post # 1 of this thread. It is not to say that the procedure mentioned there is the best procedure, it can be surely improved. However, we will have to redo all tests again because to see a standard performance, we must use a standard procedure every time with every handgun (with the difference of shooting from the handrest and shooting from elbows resting on a table off course, that you intend testing).\n\nFew things that you may consider. I did use the handrest also but the fire was more accurate without handrest simply because the table and chair that i use is a normal folding one. The table is around 1.5 ft higher than the chair but that is not enough. If i place the hand rest on this table than I have to bend down to aim which puts extra strain on my neck muscles which spoils the firing results. If one can manage a proper shooting bench in which the height of the rest and sitting place can be varied as per firers comfort, than it would be ok. But in the absence of a proper firing bench, I have experienced that its better to fire with elbows resting on the table and gun aligned to the eyes on a comfortable angle, not putting any extra strain on neck and shoulder muscles. Mind you, whatever you use or improvise, is to be placed at 10M first, than taken to 20M and than to 30M. :)\n\nHaving said that, as per my experience, the proportionate results of PT99 and MP446 would not change though there may be some difference in points scored by each gun everytime. ie, PT99 will fire more accurately than MP446 everytime (this is my experienced based on firing more than 2000 rounds with these two handguns).\n\nWaiting to see the results of your tests :)\nregards', ''),

However, all adjustable sights need to be zeroed from time to time. I always keep a screw driver in my pocket and adjust the sights whenever needed. \n\nAdjustable sights are always more delicate than the fixed ones and one has to take care of them. The gun with which you shoot bulls eye should be kept in the box with care after shooting and not in the holster. The handling of bulls eye shooting gun that would be used in competition and of a normal combat gun that you carry for SD is entirely different.

Although the 7.62 x 25 is originally an American cartridge adopted by the Germans and later by the Russians. It was treated as an orphan and as the small arms cartridge development is done basically by the Germans they gave it up after the 2nd WWar as the Russians had adopted it and the Americans also left it as an orphan.\nI agree with Denovo if more R&D had been done this would be a formidable modern cartridge and coupled with better guns like Glock ,CZs and Sig and H&K would be an ultimate military cum SD round.\nIf good hydra shocks or Black Talon type bullets were loaded in it and high capacity double column magazine pistols made for it; it would compete favourably with the 9mm Para.[/quote]\n\nI think with arrival of .357 sig the future of 7.62x25 is pretty much confined to a few followers.', ''),

(104594, ' The website for Isl Gun Club doesn''t provide much insight into membership requirements/procedure. I''d like to post some of that information here which I acquired from my visit there. \n\nFirst, my newbie impression of the club is that it offers excellent, separate ranges/facilities for the following:\n1- A 10m range for air pistol and air rifle which is partially indoors\n2- A 25m pistol range with moving (turning) targets\n3- A 50m range for .22LR\n4- An excellent skeet range with two machines opposite each other ejecting skeets\n5- A trap range and finally\n6- What they call a big bore range (25m) for all gauge handguns, with paper targets as well as one set of 5 plates, where recently our brothers Dr. Zakir sahab and Moeen sahab competed and made us proud. The plates are side by side and I believe 6" diameter, though plz check me on that\n\nMembers can bring their own licensed weapons and ammo. If they don''t have such, they can rent good quality weapons (all types: hg, sg, rifle)  from the club and pay for ammo as much as shot. Generally a widish variety of local, chinese, US ammo is available for each weapon type, with prices comparable to slightly higher to those in the market. Clay skeets are available for expected price. It is a beautiful club. THE club to join in Isl/Pindi, IF it can be afforded! which brings me to:\n\n- The membership is for life @ Rs. 600,000 with a minimum monthly bill of Rs. 4,000 plus additional charges for facilities availed\n- At least two existing members should endorse you\n- There is a waiting period of a month or two where your application is considered/reviewed\n- You''re called for an interview with the top management who ultimately grant membership\n\nAs a member, you can go any day at anytime during day hours (>10 am and <5pm) to avail the facilities, and you are charged for range time used, weapon rental if availed, ammo shot if not your own, clay skeets etc. They send you a monthly bill for these that you clear at appropriate timelines.\n\nI feel that it is prohibitively expensive. Purely my own average middle class working-man impression, but I can''t join Isl Gun Club. So another option they have is that one can go as a guest of an existing member. In that capacity:\n\n- The member informs the range personnel that xyz will attend as guest\n- The guest pays for range time, Rs 4,000 per hour, even if you utilize the range for less time than that\n- Guest pays for weapon rented, ammo, skeets used, which if i recall correctly, is the same rate as members (check me on that)\n- During rush hours or days, members are given preference to guests, as fairly expected\n- Guest pays on the spot, no alignment with member''s monthly bill\n\nThis might enable one to go for at least one or two sessions in a month IF you know a willing member. But I''m not sure if this is a long term feasibility, in order to put in a reasonable amount of practice time, without there being too many variables involved.\n\nI hope this info is helpful for general documentative and comparative purposes. Members/guests of the club, please correct me on any info i might''ve gotten wrong. AND, if you don''t mind, please say who you are, and whether Isl/Pindi members could at some time accompany you to the range', ''),

I''d like to say its my sincere hope that this discussion soon leads to concrete actionable steps that members can take to bring the idea to fruition. I''m sure there are a lot of excellent ideas on what all we''d like to have in the club. But could we start with identifying what all the hurdles are in setting up any such club? So we can think out ways to overcome them first and get going? With hurdles out of the way, I''m sure we can set up a world-class club, what with the collective knowledge, experience, passion and positive will evident in this community. \n\nThough this idea is for Peshawar, I''m sure I speak for many in Isl/Pindi to whom it''ll still suit more than the impossibility of joining Isl Gun Club.. to whom shooting at ANY club will become a possibility for the first time. In this respect, as a fellow member, even if i can''t offer contacts/resources, I offer my energies and full support :)[/quote]\n\nThank you very much for your encouragement and support Sonnenkind! I have a strong feeling we have something going here. Our efforts for the Peshawar Gun Club will not end in Peshawar, that I assure you... We will make similar efforts throughout Pakistan inshaAllah. Let''s take this as a pilot project.\n\nWith regard to hurdles, allow me to present a slightly different approach... why don''t we first discuss what the requirements for initiating such a club are and then see what ingredients we lack at present. I believe you had something similar in mind?\n\nHere goes nothing!!\n\n(1) Well to begin with, we need a strong and dedicated team (rich or not doesn''t matter ;)), it''s the effort that counts and will bring about results. For this we will need to maintain a list of Pakgun members who will volunteer to support. I shall maintain that list and keep others posted regularly. We can arrange meetings in Peshawar/Islamabad... that shouldn''t be an issue.\n\n(2) We need to find out what the government policies, procedures and regulations are on openning such a club and share such policies on this forum to inform everyone, that will also help people taking up similar initiatives in other cities of Pakistan.\n\nThese two simple steps should be a fair start. Everything else will follow naturally such as the budget, sponsors, equipment, services etc. etc.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I have already started working on this and am currently trying to arrange a meeting with the NWFP Rifle Association President to take some guidance and direction. We should have a modest start, as an enterprenuer by profession, I can''t guarantee that the simplest and cheapest starts are most successful and sustainable...', ''),

It is a master controller of the body and without its permission nothing moves or works. It produces 100s of chemicals and we only know a few of those.\n	Brain works at the speed of light using electricity. Heart, lungs, stomach, hands and legs all are under its control. The second thing Brains does is to control our behavior that means thinking, problem resolving, decision making, eating, mood, conversation, anger, happiness, social activities, memory, concentration\n	Fear is also under its control. It does two things when human face danger: 1) Fight back 2) run away to safety. In both case person may be traumatized.\n	PTSD was a diagnosed was during Hypocrites days. First mention by  Hypocrites in or about 300 BCE in Greece. But was not understood and was not popularized until the First world war. During the war Physicians in France came to observe perfectly healthy soldiers who just could not fight. They were plagued with nightmare, flash backs of blood and guts of dead soldiers They witness first hand soldiers hit by the bullets and big guns which shattered their bodies, they experienced death and destruction every day. The soldiers who were suffering with these symptoms such trauma were called shell shocked.\n	\nDiagnostic Features\nAccording to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health 4th edition (DSM IV)\nthe essential features of PTSD is development of symptoms following an exposure to an extreme horrifying stressor involving direct personal experience of an event that of actual death threat , threaten or serious  injury or other threat to oneâs physical integrity, or witnessing which involves death or threat to physical harm to person, learning about violent death or serious injury involving family member.\n	The person response to an event must involve intense fear, or horror  and helplessness .

They will need to be screened by the x-ray machine.  \n\n  \n\nAdditionally, baseball bats, bows and arrows, cricket bats, golf clubs, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks, pool cues, ski poles and spear guns are not allowed as carry-on items.  While these items are prohibited from your carry-on baggage, they may be transported to your destination in your checked baggage.  Any sharp objects in checked baggage should be sheathed or securely wrapped to prevent injury to baggage handlers and Transportation Security Officers (TSOs). \n\n  \n\nRegardless of whether an item is on the prohibited or permitted items list, TSOs have discretion to prohibit an individual from carrying an item through the screening checkpoint or onboard an aircraft if the item poses a security threat.  Therefore, TSA security screening personnel make the final decision on whether to permit items into the sterile area of the airport.  If you have any doubts, we recommend that you place your sporting equipment in your checked baggage. \n\n  \n\nFor more information on permitted and prohibited items, please our website at [url=http://www.tsa.gov]www.tsa.gov[/url]. \n\n  \n\nWe hope this information is helpful. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTSA Contact Center \n\n"\n\n\n\nany comments guys?:)', ''),

Firstly, it is no where written that bows are prohibited in Pakistan and its just a taboo I guess.\n\nSecondly airport security and customs at U.S and U.K are given full authority to do what ever they want and they are not bound to follow the above mentioned written rules.\n\nI was first stopped in U.S for 1 hour to explain why I have in my baggage the cleaning kit, high quality rifle scope and laser boresighting kit but convincing the Americans was not that difficult. The worst part was clearance at Heathrow (london) stopover where the lady would just not listen to me and not let me go on with these items declaring them a security risk onboard.\n\nAfter sometime she asked me to pay 250 pounds for the clearance and I asked her what money has to do with security matters. Well to cut short the discussion in between, I kept on saying that I will not pay a single penny and will take my stuff along and on the other hand she came down to 100 pounds.

These are equally reliable handguns with each having some edge over the others. So go for the one which you think has a better grip, when you hold it.\n\nAs far as concealed carrying is concerned, none of these is basically a CC weapon.

I find it more convenient there :)\n\nSA sahib, I had a thorough inspection of Denovo sahib''s 145 yesterday and to say the least, it''s very impressive. I have only one issue with it; the price of ammo. I like to fire my handguns as much as I can. .45 is a bit too heavy on the pocket and this would simply mean, less practice. Otherwise, I have nothing against 145 rather I may still buy it in the next few days if I dont get a robust and reliable option in 9mm. \n\nAs per my personal preference, the CC gun should be small enough to be hidden in summer clothing. In that:\n-  My #1 choice would be a hammer fired 9mm with a steel frame. I understand there is hardly any choice available in this category though there are options available in used small caliber pistols like .32 ACP and .22 LR. \n\n-  My #2 preference would be a metal frame striker fired 9mm. I know the choices in even this category are quite limited. \n\n-  My #3 preference would be a polymer frame 9mm, preferably a hammer fired one (like H&K SK2000 but its way beyond my range). I know in the end, I may have to be contended with a polymer frame striker fired pistol which is not to my liking but still .............. :(\n\nRegardless of the frame or firing mechanism, if I decide to go to any caliber other than 9x19 parabellum, I would go for .45ACP :)', ''),

(105110, ' A Lee Enfield .303 Rifle No 4 Mk 1 will kick you very hard once you put a scope on it as the butt angle ( Low comb ) is designed to be used with iron sights and the scope is mounted high. This forces the shooter to keep the head high rather than pressing the comb with the jaw.\nThe felt recoil is high other wise it really is not much of a kicker. The other thing is the metallic but plate   .\nIf the butt plate is removed and a rubber pad added and also a leather pad to raise the comb is  fixed it becomes adaptable and comfortable to shoot with a scope. \nThese  rifles when converted for  use as a snipping  rifle had both these things done.\nSome of these rifles after 2nd W War were converted in England  and re-barreled as sniper rifles by  none other than Holland & Holland.

Later I found out that original mounts for telescope were available on the internet. I selected my 303 with care. There are two versions as discussed by Skeeter60, which I owned. First the smaller rifle which is suitable for para drops. Next is the standard rifle with a long barrel, which came to me brand new. My shooting with the scope gave me a lot of pleasure. I mounted a Weaver 3-9X 40mm scope on it and had some classic shots, including a wait for two wild boars to get in line, and dropping both in one shot stone dead. The bullet went through the chest of the first, entered the chest of the second boar, and ricocheted against the backbone, going up with the pinnâ¦gggg familiarly heard after ricochet.  The heavy recoil tempted me to flinch. So I ultimately decided to go for a lighter rifle with low recoil, and moved over to 7 x 57.\n	I had accumulated a lot of ammunition for 303.

However, we can reduce dissimilarities only by adopting a standard procedure. If two individuals, which are already different, also adopt different procedures for conducting the tests than there would not be any similarity at all. By adopting same procedure, the things would be standardised to some extent, though they can never be absolutely similar because it''s human beings and not machines which are conducting these tests. \n\nBasing on above argument, I would say that MKKD brother must conduct the tests adopting the same procedure that I have used. I fully understand that this procedure may not be the best procedure for testing a handguns accuracy but since this procedure has already been used to test so many handguns, it would be better two use the same procedure because all members are quite familiar with it by now.

You''re basically saying that the tests that Gilani sb introduced will vary from shooter to shooter (which is partly correct). You''re also stating that I should perhaps come up with my own tests since that''s the only way other members will gain more insight?\n\nI agree to some of the issues you''ve raised but also disagree with some. Here''s why... \n\nFirst, Gilani sb''s tests are for people who are familiar with guns and regularly practice shooting on paper targets. They''re not for people who''ve never held a gun in their lives before. So let me assure you, that anyone who is reasonably familiar with target shooting can conduct these tests You can shoot in the air without following the basics of handgun shooting but you definitely will miss your target by a few feet at 25 meters if you don''t follow these basics in target shooting :lol:. The method doesn''t require a professional stance of shooting such as the weaver, modified weaver or one hand stances. The factors you''ve mentioned make a much bigger difference when you''re shooting with your arms stretched out, not when you''re using solid support for your arms. The most accurate shooting position is a supported position, such as firing from a benchrest with the firearm well supported by a shooting rest or sandbags; this eliminates much of the shooter''s potential for error and will generally result in much smaller groups than firing from an unsupported position. Even for a firearm that is going to be shot offhand, accuracy testing from a machine rest will provide an idea of the ultimate attainable accuracy from a handgun. But we neither have the need or resources to go that far...\n\nSecondly, the only way we can base our decisions on these tests is if at least a few shooters with basic training try these tests on the SAME gun type and model but different firearms and locations, RANDOMLY selected. Statistically speaking, we will require at least a sample of 50 five-shot groups fired from one TYPE of weapon but different randomly selected guns of that same type, at the same distance in order to generalise accuracy results of a particular firearm type. So the science of probability and statistics demands that there be more tests of the same kind, not fewer tests of different types.\n\nThird, I have already submitted my request that the tests should be conducted using a very simple (even home-made) handgun shooting rest. We will have to change the test methodology ultimately if we want more reliable results. The sooner we incorporate this change the better...\n\nFinally, I don''t believe in ''re-inventing the wheel'', which is why I will be using the same method as Gilani sahib for now. But having said that and as mentioned before... I will also try the same tests, with the same gun using a hangun shooting rest to check the difference in results.\n\nRegards.', ''),

The whole picture must be present for at least one month for acute; chronic for three months, and delayed if the symptoms appeared after 6 months of the trauma. \n      Now, of course, we all have some life events that can make us have these symptoms, however, PTSDâs symptoms persist indefinitely and do not go away by itself like other every day stress symptoms.

(105275, ' Well explained Midreestaj bro above on the SA/DA modes of 3rd generation Mil Pro models. :) I forgot to reply Nazim Sb''s second question above.\n\nNow, I''ve a major problem with this issue too, discussed at length with Denovo Sir over the phone, that I, with a habit of carrying a "live" round, somehow do not like the idea of an "activated mechanism" with a chambered round, this with regards to the firing pin/spring being in constant "tension" once you have racked the gun for feeding the live round.\n\nWith the external hammer models, the principal is quite the reverse in DA mode, in that you can "relieve" the hammer from constant "tension" by re-setting the hammer to "uncocked" position and then take a DA shot whenever needed. Here, with the internal firing mechanism that''s not possible coz the moment you rack the gun to feed your chamber with the live round you intend to keep there for days/weeks/months the physical "potential energy" behind the firing mechanism stands "activated" from that moment onwards, and I fear, during a longer period of time this may to some extent or another be detrimental to the firing mechanism. :rolleyes:\n\nThe DA modes on the these Taurus guns is principally only for a [b]second strike necessity[/b] and unworkable for a first DA shot, and I have seriously contemplated for the next time around that I field-strip my gun, to try loading the ''live" round inside the barrel [b]BEFORE[/b] I reassemble it, wonder if this trick would undo my problem of the constant "tension" in the firing mechanism, or if it''s possible at all, practically, over to you! :rolleyes:', ''),

(105278, ' [quote=MKKD]\nDear Ramzani sahib,\n\nThank you for your feedback. You''re basically saying that the tests that Gilani sb introduced will vary from shooter to shooter (which is partly correct). You''re also stating that I should perhaps come up with my own tests since that''s the only way other members will gain more insight?[/quote]\n\nYou are right on the first one but totally wrong on the second. I never meant to say that you should come up with your own test (or methods). I said that if we need to gain something out of the results of your test, they have to compared with each other (or with the same brand of Gilani Sbs results), they cannot be used for comparison with other types of brands tested by Gilani Sb. I hope that this time I was clear enough to convey my concern. \n\nYes, the best thing would be if you tested all the weapons already tested, and then we compare the results, there would''nt be anything nicer than that. !\n\n[quote=MKKD]\nFirst, Gilani sb''s tests are for people who are familiar with guns and regularly practice shooting on paper targets. They''re not for people who''ve never held a gun in their lives before. So let me assure you, that anyone who is reasonably familiar with target shooting can conduct these tests You can shoot in the air without following the basics of handgun shooting but you definitely will miss your target by a few feet at 25 meters if you don''t follow these basics in target shooting :lol:. [b]The method doesn''t require a professional stance of shooting such as the weaver, modified weaver or one hand stances[/b]. The factors you''ve mentioned make a much bigger difference when you''re shooting with your arms stretched out, not when you''re using solid support for your arms. [b]The most accurate shooting position is a supported position, such as firing from a benchrest with the firearm well supported by a shooting rest or sandbags; this eliminates much of the shooter''s potential for error and will generally result in much smaller groups than firing from an unsupported position.[/b] Even for a firearm that is going to be shot offhand, accuracy testing from a machine rest will provide an idea of the ultimate attainable accuracy from a handgun. But we neither have the need or resources to go that far...[/quote]\n\nOK, here I think my post has been taken in the negative sense.\n\nI never meant to say that you are any less of a shooter than Gilani Sb. In even the fancy shooting styles you''ve mentioned above, plus the one with the shooting rest you can never eliminate two things, [b]Trigger Control[/b] and [b]Anticipation[/b], which, by the way, play their part even in arms rested mode and deffer from firer to firer. Please dont take it again in the negative sense, I''m not saying that you are a first time shooter or dont know about these things, I''m just saying that there will be a difference (the defference can be in the positive :) )\n\nTo elaborate my point further, please see post 180 above. You see Gilani Sbs tests and then Skeeter Sbs shooting result.\nWhat if skeeter sb had conducted [b]the test[/b] in the first place (as per procedure of Gilani Sb). There are no other test of CZ 75 on this thread. So if, lets say Skeeter Sb conducted the test (and I''m sure if he uses the elbow rested position the results would not detiorate) and concludes the CZ 75 as the most Accurate amongst the guns on this thread (surpassing PT92, CZ999 etc) would that be the correct judgement? Or would all the PG members gain from it or be misinformed? (I think misinformed is a strong word, but cant think of any other at this time!)\n\n[quote=MKKD]\nSecondly, the only way we can base our decisions on these tests is if at least a few shooters with basic training try these tests on the [b]SAME gun type and model but different firearms and locations[/b], RANDOMLY selected. Statistically speaking, we will require at least a sample of 50 five-shot groups fired from one TYPE of weapon but different randomly selected guns of that same type, at the same distance in order to generalise accuracy results of a particular firearm type. So the science of probability and statistics demands that there be more tests of the same kind, not fewer tests of different types.[/quote]\n\nI really couldnt catch what you''re trying to say here. Almost all of the tests have been on 9mm, less the one at post 181 on a .22. But I do agree the same tests have to be repeated by more members to reach some [b]"statistical"[/b] conclusion.\n\n[quote=MKKD]\nThird, I have already submitted my request that the tests should be conducted using a very simple (even home-made) handgun shooting rest. We will have to change the test methodology ultimately if we want more reliable results. The sooner we incorporate this change the better...

But all ''DS'' models have one hence ''DS'' decocker safety. \n\nAK47 bro you should chamber and put the safety on. Then keep finger out of the trigger gaurd always, thats the best you can do..

The second and third generation ones are to be considered as they are free from any of the problems which the first generation ones had (misfire, striker issue, frame/slide cracking, etc).\n\nThe first generation is not the ''Pro'' model. It is simply PT145 Millennium. NOT TO BUY THIS ONE.\n\nThe second generation has Millennium Pro written on one side while PT145 written on the other. Second generation ones are "DA only". Check out my pics towards the end of AK47''s thread [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4057[/url]\n\nThe third generation has Millennium written on one side while PT145 Pro written on the other side. Third generation ones are "DS/SA" - as explained by AK47 above. Check out his pics at the beginning of his thread [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4057[/url]\n\nI have the second generation one, while Denovo and AK have the third generation.\n\nBased on ''my own'' research, I was in favour of a DA only ''compact'' handgun which I intended to use for CCW purposes. Safer and more accurate in my personal opinion. It also takes care of your concern of carrying with one in the chamber. DA only is comparatively safer in such conditions. Might I add that the trigger pull of second generation DA only 145s is so light that you may easily refer to it as makhan.\n\nIn any case, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you buy this piece of art.\n\nIt is, without a doubt, a COMPACT CANNON.', ''),

I do agree on this safety issue and Copy/Pasting a portion of my previous post to save some time hopefully It will explain the situation. ... \n\n[b]As a matter of fact the main purpose of my these modification is converting a lethal shell into a non lethal or less lethal and by using these non lethal shot you can do some target practice at your roof or indoor.  Therefore i did consider all the safety first because i know these converted shell i am using just don''t have that enough power/weight load it will hurt someone badly.[/b]\n\n[b]So you saw in the above photos upto 50 feet it only can penetrate the paper target and nothing more.

[/b]\n\n[b]Secondly:[/b]\n\n[b]The other houses showing behind in the photos are belong to the same family where i did this testing so the owner of this house/gun confirm me that no one will came up on those roof,  therefore it was a green signal to test my shell ....[/b]\n\n[b]I really appreciate your safety concern and  hoping after my this post you will be agreed.

However if u load up with 8 - 9 rounds i think that would do the trick for you but it would be in vicinity of 55k to 62k depending upon your bargaining skills. But if you fancy a 9mm I would suggest you go for either a stoeger or yavuz compact mc or yavuz bora light. All of them are reliable weapons. Stoegar and the yavuz compact mc are a little heavier than the bora light. These would fall in the vicintiy of 45k - 65k. I recently accompanied a friend to lucky star and he bought the bora light for 46.5k\nHowever if you are under some sort of a threat or whatever your reason for carrying the weapon do refer to the thread Art of double tap and CQC.

I myself have had the oppurtunity to fire a combination of magtech, prvi, chinese and local rounds altogather loaded into one mag. we have conducted this test on around a 50 rounds each make. not a single FTF or a single FTE. \nso in your words, i do think i own a REAL TOPAK.', ''),

(105494, ' nice review MT. was in your locality yesterday and was finding  a way to contact you.\nAnyways had a good session of 125 rounds at an "undisclosed" location. a spontaneous invite by a friend to test out his firearms and some R&R.\n\nThe 809 handled well all the rounds fired which included 25 chinese redbox, 50 whitebox and 50 Norinco 9mm 95yr batch(quite old). I found the sound of the whitebox to be clear and sharp. Positive feedback from all ammo used with no FTF/FTE/FTFire. The re-cleaning of the firing pin and proper lubing did the job well as suggested by SS. as always couldnt get targets on such short notice and not much of an artist so did away with them. Pardon me for the lack of targets. will arrange one from now to get it do an orthodox test as tailored by GilaniBro. \n\nShot at ceramic tiles from 15m with good results. Had a chance to load POF2z which but passed on the idea till I got to at least 300 round mark. [b]Primer strikes were clean and centre, not as light as before in the initial runs[/b]. I suppose the firearm was`nt cleaned as extensively as it should have been. Will make sure its dones properly each time. WD-40 did well for clearing the residue.\n\nAnother good performer was the CF98 which was shot NIB after a lot of degreasing and oiling. a total of 50 rounds with zero FTF/FTE/FTfire.

I found 3 different magazine reviews on it and the listed trigger-pull weight (DAO) range was 6-8 pounds, which was better than the impression I had. The stock Glock trigger is supposed to be 5.5 lbs. \n\nThis mean''t that the PT145 Pro DAO triggers are only a 0.5 lb to 1.5 lb heavier than Glock''s. PT145 Pro''s trigger is a beauty compared to several other DAO options within same range. And once I dry fired it couple of times at Al-Haris while I was there to buy it, I was completely sold at the smooooth (makhan) trigger pull I experienced.\n\nFor more insight on DAO pistol accuracy, read this \n[url]http://teppoudo.org/17-double-action-first-shot-with-a-dasa-pistol[/url]', ''),

He and the members who go with him there should repeatedly make that dealer aware of the community which PakGuns represent and make sure that any member who visits this particular dealer gets the same (or even better) rates when he introduces himself as PG member.\n\nWe should ensure that dealers know who we are and that we are INFORMED and know when we are being taken for a ride.

(105571, ' Dr. Hanif Malik,\n\nThe biggest threat to hares in Pakistan is loss of habitat resulting from urbanisation, changes in agricultural land management practices where no cover is left for the birds and animals to seek refuge and breed in. \n\nFurthermore, trapping for commercial sale in markets and unsustainable hunting, mostly by using and a spotlight at night has also affected their population adversely. Shooting a few hares in a night is OK, but to shoot a dozen is not. \n\nFrankly, I do not find shotgunning hare at night sporting anymore. I would rather use a 22 rifle for that - a lot more challenging. If I must really shoot them.\n\nWith hounds and hawks, hare hunting is daytime sport, and it''s a fair chase.  All three - man, beast and bird need to be really fit and skilled in order to be able to track a hare, find it, flush it and catch it, and there are hardly any second chances.', ''),

I use the word "collected" and not "hunted" because these are canned hunt, as 99% of all South African lions hunts are. This is one of the reasons that SCI has banned all lion trophy entries in its record book from South Africa.  \n\nTigers are another story, they are offered in South Africa but these are all illegal hunt and one to be avoided at all cost by hunters.

There are  40 million American who have this problem. I do not know how many Pakistani suffer with this problem? Probabaly in the thousends but goes undiagnised and untreated. Insomani is a cause of  many many physical problems from tiredness to heart attack. Sleep deprivation is used as measure to obtain information from suspected criminals with good reults. Those who can not sleep for them it is a torture. \n               Sleep is a physiological state. It is a complex biological phenomenon; which is after thousends of years of research\nyet, it remains a mystery. First mentioned  by Hypocretes  2500 hunderds yeras ago in his writting and prescribed hypnotics and prayer to God of sleep "Hypnosis", the father of modern medicine.  Indian Yervadec medicne described it as a curse to man kind, inducing sleep by meditation and  sleep medications asuch as Banhg and opium. nothing is full proff.\n                        What causes insomania, well several reasons  that we now understand and several reasons are still uncovered. Sleep is a rhythm  cycle called circadian rhythm which is controled by a"Master Clock" located somewhere in our barin. It has 25 hours rather than 24 hours/day.  Sleep is divided into 4 stages: Haalf awake and hale sleep, secondly,light sleep, thendeep sleep, last stage is deepest sleep; difficult to awaken. The last stage mimic total paralysis of major muscles. This happens 90 minutes after the initial stage. Put to gatgher these 4 stages called Non Rapid eye movement.\n                          Those who has sleep problem they do not go through these stages or just sleep for 9 or ten minutes and then wide awake. So what cause this disease? There are are two major reasons. Either it is Psychlogical such as obsessve compelsive, schizophernia, depression, mania, generalized anxiety (nervousness), hyper activness, unreasonable excessive worries, over stressed. The treatment is various medications given by the expert doctor, meditation such as Namaz, exercise 6 hours before going to bed, nicotine and caffine restriction, no alcohol, if can not sleep within the 15 minutes, get up and go to other room, lastly objective therapy to replace dysfunctional attitude about sleep,adaptive substituties and correct unrealistic expactations.\n               For biological problems such as cancer, angina, asthma,chronic pain, which causes insomania the treatment is availble but i`s  beyond the scope of this artical.[/quote]\n\nAoa \nBro, you are discussing medical issues.

However to give you a background, when I took it to Bukhsh Elahee for disposal, he offered me Rs 5,000 for it as a great favour. I had some dealings with Haider Arms, and a number of transactions of sale purchase and exchange. He offered me a package deal which hopefully gave me a better deal. Later he got a new butt fitted to it and modified the mount for telescope. I would not know his asking price now. As for the ammunition, though it is abundantly in use in the country, and also made in Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa, its price is not quoted on our website.

A few weeks of playing time, these won''t feel so big and heavy.\n\nYou yourself have summed up the pros and cons pretty well and now it''s up to you to decide which one to go for. If Safety comes First, then go for PT92. If longer life (in terms of rounds fired) is preference, then go for CZ999 (Though I don''t think you''ll be firing tens of thousands of rounds, which is what the life of a barrel is normally - hence this factor becomes irrelevant).\n\nLastly, hold both of them in your hand.

I have personally never fired a pt92 so would not comment on that. but the cz999 is a very accurate and a very reliable weapon. pt92 is an exact replica of a beretta 92 which is a class in itself. since you are new to the gun club, go for a less expensive model, (dont know what your budget is) like a chinese cf98 or a turkish weapon, get the feel of a gun, get used to firing it. then as your exprience grows the sky is the limit (figuratively speaking).', ''),

(105788, ' Coolbox18 brother, I wont tell you which weapon to buy because that is entirely your prerogative. However, I would like to comment on few concerns that you have raised. \n\n-  [b]Safety[/b]. Well, its a personal preference in my view (means standards of safety differ from person to person). But are you always going to room around with a round in the chamber and safety on? Personally speaking, I only do this when there is a likely danger. In most cases, its not required and therefore, I just keep a loaded magazine in because it just takes a second to rack the slide and get your pistol ready to fire. Yes, while traveling in a car, you might like to keep a round in the chamber and than put the safety / decocker on and keep the gun handy in an IWB holster clipped with the car door pocket. In that position, I would personally prefer a decocker so that I just push the hammer back with my thumb while I am straightening my hand and get ready to fire. So please analyse the likely use with regard to safety before you select or discard a pistol due to improper safety mechanism. If you always live in a state of danger, a Glock like pistol with no manual safety is a better option. \n\n-  [b]Bluing getting off / Scratches[/b]. Every bluing will go off sooner or later and every pistol will get few scratches also if it used regularly. So do not bother too much about it. If you intend keeping your handgun locked in a box always, the finish would last for a longer duration and vice versa. SS finish in my view has longer life. It also has great advantage during cleaning because all dirt particles / residues are clearly visible and its easy to clean that way. \n\n-  Fahad sahib has mentioned that CZ999 is a sure weapon and Taurus weapons have mixed reviews. Well, we are talking about PT92/99 and not Taurus pistols in general. There is lot of difference in Taurus striker fired pistol (9 mm) and Taurus hammer fired pistols. I am yet to hear a negative thing about PT99 or PT92. I have personal experience of firing more than 2000 rounds with PT92 and 99. [b]Not even once, I experienced any FTF or FTE issues.[/b] Same goes for CZ999, never any stoppages. With Stoeger, I have experienced occasional failures to feed, but not often or on a alarrming rate. In accuracy, PT92/99 is the best and in ease of carriage, CZ999 and Stoeger are almost the same (CZ999 is slightly longer but relatively lighter and thinner. Stoeger is slightly shorter but wider and heavier than CZ999. Conclusion, one cant hide both :) ) \n\nPlease keep one important thing in mind. If one is proficient at gun handling and is a reliable shot, even a lesser pistol  will deliver during the time of need. If one is not good at these two things, even the best pistol in the world does not have the capability to automatically aim and fire. This means one has to practice a lot and for practice one needs ammo and lots of it. Here, i would support SA sahib that whatever you buy, please ensure that you buy enough ammo for practice, at least 250-300 rounds.\n\nAnother thing is feel and balance. Please go to the market and have a feel of these weapons. Than make your own decision :) \nregards and happy buying.', ''),

(105824, ' Ilyas sahib, Usama sahib, thanks a lot Sir :)', ''),
(105825, ' Please allow me to share some of my impressions on this topic by SA sahab that i have formed after studying this at some length over time\n\n1- Dry fire practice allows one to rigorously work at ''most'' fundamentals of marksmanship. Barring follow through/trigger reset, for which there would actually need to be a proper discharge to cycle the weapon, one can practice all of these without the need to actually be on a firing range. Live fire, whether for sport, competition, hunting or hd/sd of course is the real thing for which dry fire is but one practice regimen of many. You can see the importance of dry fire if you can practice sight alignment, sight picture, breathing and trigger control without disrupting sight alignment in your own home at no expense at a time of your choosing. Also with the help of a partner you can identify and work at some of the flaws in your technique safely, flinching for instance, which might otherwise not become apparent if the weapon actually recoils off a real discharge. I don''t suppose i need to mention that safety while doing dry practice at home is paramount. Lock real ammo elsewhere. Verbally tell yourself ''dry practice'' starts now. Follow a planned practice session. When done, tell yourself ''dry practice has ended now'' and not a single trigger pull for practice after that.\n\nCompetitive shooters frequently practice dry firing drills and there are manuals dedicated to doing it right from credible and bona fide instructors and schools\n\n2- Detriments, first to your shooting skill, are of course that this isn''t the complete picture. You will never develop the feel of the proper gripping strength and shooting rhythm unless your body becomes aware of what it needs to do to manage recoil, re-acquire target, reset trigger and be ready for follow up shots. So don''t develop muscle memory or practices that don''t include real live fire dynamics\n\nDetriment to your weapon is possible damage to the firing pin mechanism. Now there has been a lot of argument on this matter and as far as i have been able to gather, it isn''t completely conclusive one way or the other. I''m afraid i haven''t read much about rifles and shotguns in this regard so i''ll limit the following to handguns. The general sentiment seems to be that most modern center fire pistols should be safe to dry fire, because the firing pin doesn''t hit anything on an empty chamber. Some say that this should especially be true because some pistols, Glocks for a prime example, are ''required'' to fire dry as a part of field stripping them so it should be safe. Others say that they have dry fired their guns 1000s of times and never broken the firing pin or damaged the firing mechanism etc and I believe there is merit on all these accounts.\n\nThe argument from the other side is that it is actually the part of the firing pin that hits the inside of the breach block to stop it going beyond a certain point on an empty chamber that is susceptible to damage. ie not the end of the firing pin that strikes the primer (which in dry fire will really not hit anything). Some have reported that this part over time starts to wedge into the opening through which the firing pin extends for strike and as a result the pin doesn''t retract. They would then need to physically push the pin back to dislodge it from behind the breach face. Some people say the firing pin weakens at this place of repeated strike and the weapon becomes unreliable, causing many FTFs. Rarely, but surely people also say that the firing pin breaks at this point. Some manufactures insist and state in manuals for their guns that dry firing will damage it, use snap caps (Stoeger cougar manual, for instance, which i''ve read myself). I''d be inclined to follow the manual! I''m not sure about spring based snap caps but i''m inclined to think that just strike-stoppage at the required place should do the trick, based on the physics that seems to be involved here. Afterall, the 9mm snap cap is the same dimensions as a regular 9mm round and that has no spring padding, only strike stoppage and retraction by design.\n\nIn the end, wherever i''ve read on this matter, there isn''t a conclusion whether dry fire is safe for ALL handguns or unsafe for ALL handguns. I''m sure individual designs will to a greater or lesser degree or perhaps not at all be affected by this. Try to understand the firing mechanism of your own gun to reason out whether it should be detrimental or not\n\n3- Countermeasure for shooting technique, be aware of exactly where dry fire is beneficial and what part of your overall technique it develops and especially that it DOES NOT develop. ie put it in its proper perspective as part of a much larger whole\n\nCountermeasure for avoiding undue damage to your weapon - simply, use snap caps! Even IF damaging one''s weapon is a myth, or this doesn''t apply to all guns/ manufacturers, I''d come to this conclusion for myself and my weapon for sure, because the added advantages of snap caps are:\n- Practicing administratively loading/unloading your gun safely in your home (safety always paramount)\n- Simulating all types of malfunctions and practicing clearing them safely\n- (Dont kill me.. yet) Mixing live rounds with snap caps on the range so some1 watching can trick you into firing a dud and seeing whether you flinch. If done safely and with knowledge, this is a tool employed by instructors to good use', ''),

(105889, ' OK, coming back to the topic of this thread, ie, cocneal carry handguns. \n\nOne thing which I am sure is understood by all, is the purpose of a conceal carry gun. That is to say when a person wants to carry a gun for self defence yet does not want anyone to know that he is carrying a gun (unless he is physically searched or closely inspected), would carry a gun which is small enough to be concealed. If this statement is true than IMHO, it implies that in CC, size of foremost importance. Equally important is the reliability, accuracy (up to 7-10 m only) and potency. \n\nLets take them one by one. \n\n[b]Size[/b]. What should be the ideal size for CC. Well, that might differ from man to man. Obviously, a gun which would be too large to be concealed by a 5''6" man of skinny built might be a very concealable gun for a man of say 6''5" height and a heavy built. Also, during winters, even a large gun can be concealed but during summers in warm areas, it may be difficult to conceal a much smaller gun. However, in our part of the world where the weather is mostly warm rather hot and average built is not very large, we would need a comparatively smaller gun for CC. IMHO, a gun of less than 6.5 inches length (163 mm) and 1.2 inches width (30 mm) is bare minimum for conceal carry. Any thing smaller would be a bonus. Moreover, the gun should not be too heavy also. Max of 750 gm weight may be taken as standard, lesser the better. \n[b]\nReliability[/b]. A CC gun, which would mostly be used at closer ranges under life threatening environment, has to be absolutely reliable. No compromise on this. Any gun that is ammo sensitive is strongly not recommended, no matter how small it may be. \n\n[b]Accuracy[/b]. General understanding is that since a CC gun is to be used in self defence at very short ranges, it does not need to be a very accurate one and even a less accurate gun would do. I disagree with this line of thinking. IMHO, a CC gun is to be used for a very very serious business, ie, saving ones life. It has to be dead accurate at 7-10 M at least. That is why we see that all good CC guns like Sig P239, Glock 26, Kahr K9, Kahr MK9, HK 2000sk, Ruger SR9, Walther PPK etc are dead accurate at 7m, capable of making a 2-3 inches group from this distance. If a gun makes say 7-8 inches group away from the bull from 7-10 m distance, it cant be trusted at a time when the heartbeat is likely to be 120 and hands might be trembling. In such conditions, most normal human beings would not be able to fire as accurately as they do during routine range practices. So one can''t relegate accuracy at any cost. IMHO, the only difference in the accuracy expected of a range gun and of a CC gun is of distance. A good range gun makes a 2-3 inch group at 25-30 M, a good CC gun does the same up to say 10 M, that''s it. With an inaccurate range gun, one is likely to loose a match. With an inaccurate CC gun, one may end up losing his life :(\n\n[b]Potency[/b]. A CC gun must have good stopping power. It is said that shot placement is what matters. Agreed. However, preferably one should be using such ammo that even if he misses the vitals, the target is neautralised to a great extent. I would therefore not recommend a caliber smaller than .380 ACP or 9x18mm Makarov for CC. 9x19 parabellum would be better. .45 ACP would have a very potent stopping power but would also increase the overall weight and decrease the overall capacity. However, 9x19 and .45 ACP, both would be appropriate, having their own advantages and disadvantages. \n\nI can''t say about other members who may have different requirements for CC or may have a different idea of CC. But in my personal manner of thinking, these are the traits that one should look into while selecting a CC gun. \n\nUnfortunately, we don''t find many affordable guns in Pakistani markets that fulfill the above mentioned criteria. :(', ''),

To be more precise, any handgun (in 9x19 mm) that can not fire POF or Chinese ammo well would not be my choice as an individual (because these are perhaps two brands whose supply is mostly guaranteed). A reliable gun in my view should fire all types of branded ammo without any problems. But everyone has his own preferences and experiences.............  :)', ''),

Over all duty guns should have as stated by most experts in the field anywhere between 5lbs to 4lbs trigger pulls for carry.  Some even go as far as 3.5lbs.  Any trigger pull below this value is considered competition and some competition guns have trigger pulls as low as 2lbs a difficult thing to achieve as most guns at this low pull tend to NOT strike primers well.  Short trigger is not something I would recommend to anyone on a glock - it will mean slightly cutting down the firing pin lug (cut too much and your gun may not cock or for that fact accidently fire (ofcourse the striker will NOT hit the primer due to the firing pin block)).\nGlocks are NOT fun to shoot with the hard triggers and for those carrying for SD...well then all I can state regarding the hard triggers is...

The American Eagle brand name is the low cost line of ammunition manufactured by Federal, one of the largest U.S. ammo companies. American Eagle ammo generally gives good performance for value priced "shooter grade" ammunition.\nThis commercial load has several advantages over the original military loading. The original military load used corrosive Berdan primers. Not only did that make the round non-reloadable, it also required that the pistol be cleaned promptly after use to keep the corrosive primers from damaging the barrel.\nThe American Eagle load, in contrast, uses U.S. standard Boxer primers and brass cases. This allows the emtpy cases to be reloaded economically for reuse. The Boxer primers are also non-corrosive so prompt cleaning, while always a good idea, is no longer absolutely required.\nThe American Eagle 9x18mm Makarov load does differ from the original military load in bullet weight. While the original specification was for a 95 gr bullet, this load uses a 90 gr bullet instead.\nIn practical use I have tried both the original military loads and the 90 gr American Eagle loads side by side and can not detect any real difference. The point of aim for both loads seems to be within an inch or so of each other at 15 yards and, if anything, the American Eagle load seems to have slightly softer recoil.\nI have used the American Eagle load in an East German Makarov and in a Bulgarian Makarov and it has worked well in both. That is more then I can say for another popular 9x18 Makarov commerical load currently imported from Russia.\n"', ''),

It can prevent the development of a flinch, or cure an existing one. It is more convenient than going to the range and allows you to practice basic gun manipulations without burning ammo unnecessarily. It allows you to build up thousands of repetitions of attaining perfect sight alignment, a perfect trigger squeeze and a complete follow through, without the expense of firing thousands of rounds while doing it. \n\nDry firing is a convenient way to marry the trigger finger with the rest of the body. It is better than actual shooting in one respect -- it allows you to see exactly the sight picture and sight alignment without the interference of recoil or muzzle blast.\n\n[b]To do or not to do > Damage aspect[/b]\n\nMost modern centerfire handguns are not going to be damaged by dryfire.

Even under these sub-standard conditions, the pistols performed quite well. Under better light conditions and with more focused firing, this pistol will surely perform far far better and would have easily been around 130 points. I have fired Glocks also, but this is a special pistol, no doubt about it. This is the second Steyr I have fired, the first one belonged to Bader Janjua sahib.

(106135, ' [quote=ARJ]@ Abbas, Gilani bro, Dr Zakir, Moeen & all senior Members\n\nBanking on your knowledge of CZ999, do you think the (Lack of) safety feature of CZ would be a disadvantage for a complete novice to own it ???  especially if we compare the situation with guns with all the safety features!\n\nPlease dont limit your reply to ..." than dont carry a chambered gun" :P\n\nyour answer would be highly appreciated if it is made in reference to other guns within the same price range[/quote]\nARJ brother, factual reply to your question is that CZ999 does not have a manual safety but has a decocker. Most other handguns available in Pakistani market come with manual safeties. \n\nHowever, this statement does not give a complete picture and does not prove that CZ999 is an unsafe pistol to carry. As I have already mentioned in some other thread, the notion of safety in my personal view is more on mental than physical plane. It means different to different people. One person may feel the need of fool proof safety while another person might say that safeties are just an irritant and may delay / jeopardize the reaction of firer when he needs to act fast.  After all, Glock does not have a manual safety and Sig P226, one of the best pistols ever manufactured, also does not have a manual safety rather just a decocker. And mind you, these two are amongst the most widely used firearms with LEAs but we don''t very often hear of accidents that so and so fired the gun because there was no manual safety feature on it. So I think opinions will differ on this subject and to me, it''s really a matter of personal choice.\n\nPersonally speaking, I consider CZ999 a safe pistol to be carried. But this is my personal opinion which has got something to do with my carrying habits that I have developed over the years. I normally don''t carry a round in the chamber unless the danger is very imminent. I feel that in normal circumstances, there is always enough time to rack the slide and shoot (it takes slightly more than a second). But someone else may have a very different carrying habit and accordingly, a different requirement for safety in the handgun he is carrying. :)', ''),

They remain in the body only 6-27 hours. Clonazepzm (Klonopin) and Clorazepate (Tranxene) are long acting. There half life extends from 30-200 hours depending upon the weight and age of a person. One of the side effect of these medication is sedation, therefore, hazardous work such as driving must be avoided. Theses also carry the risk of addiction but Physician has to weigh the benefits against the addiction.\n	To precribe any medication is tricky. Many factors are involved. Just as one shoe size does not fit all, so, is the medications. No two people are the same, so is the medication. Therefore, medication should be individualized to fit that one person.', ''),

Our non profitable research plateform is named "Brains for Innovative Research Development & Strategic Studies". We developed a number of solutions and working on some innovations. I would like to share some innovative things with PGians. There are several sources of renewable energy including wind, solar, thermal and geo etc. About 15 Million Mega Watts electricity can be produced in Pakistan from Solar Power per hour!!!! This is enough power for whole world needs. There is no lack of sources but only ignorance, corruption and personal agenda seeking minority that is our biggest drawback. I will be very happy to provide information, technological help and guidance in this field if any of PGian friend asks. Please see following.\n\n\n\n\n[quote]Stirling Engine Solar System can help meet energy crisis \n\n\nBy Manzoor Qadir \nLAHORE: The Renewable Energy Research Division of BIRDS (Brains for Innovative Research Development and Strategic studies - a Pakistan based think tank) is developing a technology using modified Stirling engine and sun tracking solar reflectors to produce electricity at no re-occurring cost. \n\nOnce, developed this technology will be available for mass production of in-house power generation units with zero carbon emission from 5 to 25 kw/h capacity at very low manufacturing cost. A proposal is submitted to the Chief Minister Punjab for the promotion and capacity building of research & development of project and to safe guard the intellectual property rights of the idea, Noman Shah, Chief Coordinator BIRDS, and former Project Director Electronic Government Directorate, Ministry of Information and Technology, Pakistan told The Post \n\nHe said the solar stirling dish engine technology had been developed over nearly three decades by some of the world''s top engineers and scientists in ford advanced development operations, Mcdonnell-Douglas Aerospace & Defense And Boeing Aerospace & Defense and further other advanced countries became involved relevant research and development and currently many companies including Sun Solar, Sandia Laboratories, Stirling Engine Systems, Tessera Solar are producing such dish solar power systems. He said once developed this technology will make load shedding and energy crises a forgotten dream. Pakistani engineers and scientists has enormous capability and ability to accept any challenge and if they can develop indigenous nuclear technology why they can not make the country self sufficient through unleashing the tremendous powers of solar energy and develop solar reflector based stirling power generation systems. BIRDS chief informed that they are also working on several innovative ideas like parabolic trough solar thermal power generation and energy storage methods as well. The world largest and first commercial parabolic trough 50 mw solar power plant is constructed near Guadix In Andalusia, Granada Province (Spain), one of the sunniest regions in Spain costing 300 million euros. The solar energy in the deserts of Thal is sufficient to produce enough electricity to fulfill all the current and future requirements of the country and can be constructed at economical cost compared to the international examples. \n\nShah further said BIRDS is also working to bring foreign investors from all around the world to Punjab and one of the delegate in this regard from Spain is currently on visit to Lahore is looking for investment opportunities in renewable energy and low cost housing sectors.\n[/quote]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq997IJ][img]http://s3.postimage.org/997IJ.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

It is therapy that provide realistic view of life, improve reasoning, and insight. However, its effectiveness is questionable. In severe depression patient may become irrational. Expiernces hearing voices (Hallucinations) and have false fixed ideas. Totally out of touch with reality. In such cases, patient needs protection from himself and monitor 24 hours, thus hospitalization is required. In such cases, Psycho therapy is not feasible but when patient is stabilized on medication, the therapy helps relapse and should be used as adjunct with medication.\nRemember, mental illnesses runs in the family. It is a problems of chemical imbalance in the brain. Most of mental illnesses has no permanent cure but control the symptoms to improve life''s function.\nSituational mental illnesses are not permanent and person recover over time with or without the therapy or meds. Example: Grieving the death of loved one create situational depression, anxiety, sleep disorder. This is normal human response are not labeled as mental illnesses. Psychotherapy of any kind will work in such cases but there are many other illnesses which has no treatments as yet.

As for an actual round count...sorry\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe life of my plastic 20 gauge caps was one use. The plastic rim around the bottom of the shell was instantly snapped off by the extractor.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Pachmyer:[/b] not very long, maybe a few hundred times before the "primer" is so dented that you may question whether it cushions the firing pin much at all.\n\n[b]A-Zoom:[/b] A long time. I haven''t noticed any wear that causes me to question their effectiveness after multiple hundreds of uses.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThis probably indicates that it depends on the manufacturer or brand of the snap cap.

(106403, ' [quote=MKKD][quote=Gilani]grin313 bro, as Aquarius mentioned the only difference in Yargin Pya and Viking is the frame. Internals are the same and one can see the same huge size breach and other things. So theoretically speaking, yes. But practically speaking, 7N21 and 7N31 is strictly a military ammo and can not be sold to anyone except Russian Army. Similarly Yargin Pya can also not be sold to civilians. So even if one has a Viking, he will probably never be firing 7N21 with it :)  However, the owner of a Viking is assured that he can fire any kind of +p or +p+ ammo in his gun and not worry about anything.[/quote]\n\nGilani sb are you sure about this? I thought the +p and +p+ ammo are ok for the Grach but not the Viking... The Viking is a sporting derivative of the Grach...?[/quote]\nMKKD brother, as per my knowledge, there is no problem firing +p and +p+ ammo with Viking which has the same internal construction as Garch. I have fired couple of hundred +p rounds with Viking and it behaved very very normal and their was not much of difference in recoil as compared to normal ammo. IMHO, Viking is capable of firing hot loads better than any other pistol currently available in Pakistan; PT92/99 would be second :)', ''),

(106439, ' Ef_Kay:Dream theory and interpretation of dreams were special interest to  Sigmund Freud.  According to him, dreams are wishes unfulfilled, desires to control self (Ego) repeating of past day joy and fears. Essentially, dreams are part of early stage of sleep (half sleep and half awake). Four stages of sleep, in 8 hours repeat automatically. Dreams are self defense mechanism and suppressed emotions of child hood. Dreams analysis was done first by Freud in 1900. He divided the dreams in four categories: 1) Anxiety ,2) Punitive, 3) fear, 4) Suppress sexual dreams.\n	 All mammals, cats and dogs dreams. Person dreams in the first stage of sleep (REM) but as gradually a person goes into deep sleep, the dreams stops and person almost anesthetized. But about 90 minutes later the brain clock feed backs to in reverse order from 4th stage to first, person dreams again then the cycle is repeated. A person dreams 12-20 dreams during sleep. Most of the dreams are forgotten by morning and fragmented dreams are remembered, Why? I do nât know.\n	From the dawn of history, dreams are associated with myths, and  mysticism. Who knows, that interpretation is true or false or Devine intervention. Mystic believes in them and science is puzzled just can not answer. I have my sister and very mystic whose dreams sometimes hit on the head of  the nail. For me, they are just dreams. Try thinking something pleasant before you go to sleep, you will be surprised that it is repeated in your dreamsâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦but not always. \n	Most of the dreams occurs early in sleep cycle and just before dawn, when person is refreshed and reenergized in the morning. Human are night sleepers by nature. The cats, lions, and snakes are day sleepers. While we human work during the day, cats take naps all day and awake most of the night. If you have dog, observe him when he is dreaming. Twitching, and screaming is most often observed in dogs when dreaming (fear, anxiety or punishment dream).  No one is expert on dreams and certainly, I am not. Modern days psychiatry does not recognize dreams as a part of medical science and has no significance or use in current psychology.', ''),

(106448, ' Faisji sahib, thanks for the input Sir. I wanted to have input from someone who has fired extensively with a Makarov over the years :)\n\nAK47 Sir, now, I am quite interested in Makarov too. So its now between PT145 and Baikal MP442 :). Both seem to have their own peculiar advantages. Makarov has steel frame which has always been my preference. Its mechanism is very simple and time tested for its reliability, however, difficult availability and potency of ammo is the downside. PT145 has the advantage of a potent caliber but somehow, I dont feel very comfortable with a polymer frame, that too with a .45 ACP round. Something like Kahr K9 or MK9 or T9 would be very interesting. The search and research goes on........... :)\n\nAs for ballistics, for FMJ cartridge, it goes like.................... (data taken from internet)\n\n[b]9x17 Short / .380 ACP / 9mm Browning Short / 9mm Kurz / 9mm Corto[/b]\nBullet weight.......... 6.16 grams (95 grains) \nMuzzle velocity.......290 meter / sec (951 ft/sec) \nMuzzle energy........260 Joules\n  \n[b]9x18 Makarov[/b]\nBullet weight.......... 6.1 grams (95 grains)\nMuzzle velocity.......310 meter / sec (1017 ft/sec) \nMuzzle energy........302 Joules\nNote; 9x18 Makarov is a different cartridge from 9x18 Ultra / 9x18 Police. Both are not interchangeable. \n\n[b]9x19 Luger / Parabellum [/b]\nBullet weight.......... 7.45 grams (115 grains)\nMuzzle velocity.......352 meter / sec (1155 ft/sec) \nMuzzle energy........461 Joules\nNote: These are specs for normal commercial FMJ round. There is a huge variety of ammo available in 9x19 with much higher muzzle velocities and muzzle energies in a variety of bullet types. \n\n[b].45 ACP / 11.43x25 mm[/b]\nBullet weight.......... 14.9 grams (230 grains) \nMuzzle velocity.......255 meter / sec (837 ft/sec) \nMuzzle energy........484 Joules\nNote; Above specs are for commercial FMJ loads. Like 9x19, many hotter loads are also available in .45 ACP which have higher muzzle velocities and muzzle energies. \n\nI wanted to get chamber pressure data also for the above cartridges but could not. \n\nFrom above specs, one may conclude that 9x17 or .380 ACP does not seem to have enough stopping power that one would need for SD. 9x18 Makarov is just ok. 9x19 para and .45ACP, both are potent rounds with enough stopping power. Variety of hotter loads available in these cartridges makes them much more versatile and lethal.  However, this must be remembered that ammo is fired from a gun and if the gun is not reliable and accurate, ammo wont make much of difference anyway. :)', ''),

If I''m not very wrong, something like 21000 psi! :rolleyes:\n\nFinally about the polymer body, well, had this thing in my mind too at the time of purchase, and Ilyas bro also wasn''t satisfied about this factor when I had discussed with him before I went for it, but the "[i]dual recoil spring[/i] [i]mechanism[/i]" takes care of this quite well, heck you can''t even think of "[b]racking[/b]" this gun comfortably in a haste! :)\n\nFurthermore, did an exhaustive "review check" throughout Google and all major U.S gun forums, nowhere did I come across any such defects/misadventures, in fact, I was surprised to see the quantum of positive reviews on a Taurus original! :)\n\nThose types of cases (frame cracks/slide derailments,kabooms, etc) usually occur as you know with "home-loaded" ammo, and then they happen even to non-polymer models!\n\nStill, best of luck with your choice, both guns fulfill your criteria well, yet the [i]pound and punch [/i]of "452 joules", still in my opinion, is somewhat different from 300 joules or so, giving a  much better "hydrostatic shock" capability upon anything hit, which requires somewhat 500 joules or more, still variable according to the distance shot from.\n\n In any case, however, the "trajectory" of the ammo, flat or curved, I believe matters little at CQB situations, so never mind a few hundred feet less/per second in velocity, the "[i]cavity[/i]" at the "rear" of any fleshy target, [b]MAY GOD FORBID IT[/b], speaks somewhat quite a dangerous language overall! \n\nI''d say, however, with a .45 in hands already, I certainly wouldn''t mind the Mak, anyway!

(106486, ' Salam to all my Bros. A interesting topic, here are some suggestion from my side:-\n\nFirst of all the hot water cleaning is a very old procedure for cleaning the arms however it is done in old days by army''s armourer or etc due to unavailability of wd-40 type oils. The weapons in the old days are not that much fancy and coloured like now a days. they are rough and tough and for that reason they have no such issues of getting your arms in rust/colour damaging etc. However in todays world kind of weapons we held are coloured/chrome and absorves the water qucikly if it is hot especially, because they are coloured/chrome in hot process and gets weak in same procedure very much resultantly can lead you in trouble of getting your arms colour/chrome deffective. \n\nSuch practice is only recommended by me in case when your weapon stored long ago at some place, have very much of rust and dirt on it and you find much difficult to clean/polish it through modern and much effective cleaning oils.', ''),

(106496, ' @epicman Bro wellcome abroad, the answer of your question is that it is true that you have been granted for the arms license by the government but there are some thing i would like to mention because had i had experienced such situation 4 times in my life and the result are not same each time. Always keep a thing in your mind that although govt. allowed you to carry/possess license arms but they don''t like the situation specially police that you have been searched by them and a gun have been found from you, i mean to say they knows the fact that any person could carry gun with him, but they don''t like peoples who r at the time equal to them like police etc. they always tries to keep you in some trouble for getting their chai panni even if u had license also, no matter you had killed/injured any BG for a legal and geniune reason but they will inquire you and tries to be capture you in any kind of matter which could help them for getting chai panni. Always try to not get involved in such matters but if the condition is serious then first you had to call the police and informed them about the situation alongwith with your weapon information and after then if you had killed any BG inside your house it will be much easier for you to convince them. However in a condition like mobile snatching or etc you had to judge it by yourselve that if you killed a BG then do you have much courage and links with police official or other sources because you had to finish the case before it is registered in P.S and if it is done then you had to prove it in court and had to spent money/time/energy for finish it off.', ''),

(106641, ' I am much late coming into the thread.  \n\nSome thoughts:\n\nMovement rearward in a self-defense situation has merit.  All movement should help you survive if done correctly.  There is the sudden, fast, explosive movement to be done as you draw and force the attacker to deal with your movement from where he was attacking, then:\n\n- distance favors the trained shooter.  (this assumes you are better trained than the attacker)\n- rearward movement is smoother; the toe to heel roll produces much less movement in the gun than the forward or side step.\n- it shows retreat, "even though I was retreating, he kept attacking, that is why I shot."\n\nAlso submitted for your consideration:\n\nThe failure to stop drill (2 shots to center mass, an evaluation, and then a shot to the head, was submitted as a solution to one of a few problems, these being:\n\n- a criminal attacker high on drugs (crack, cocaine, meth) who may not immediate cease an attack simply because he was shot.\n- a criminal attacker wearing body-armor/ballistic vests so that the shots to the chest did not stop the attack\n\nLately the failure to stop drill has fallen a bit out of favor in the US law enforcement circles.  When officer''s shot twice (and maybe missed twice) then paused the attackers were still attacking and some were hurt or killed.  \n\nSome LEOs are training to continue the rapid shots to the center mass.  The head is hard to hit.  Continued shots to the body bring about incapacitation, eventually without the higher risk of a missed head shot.', ''),

(106647, ' A story from my father in law.  During Vietnam he lead a platoon.  He became fed up with being ambushed crossign rice fields and expending entire basic loads and not having a body to show for all that shooting.\n\nSo, during training one day he took a squad to the edge of a rice field and said, "Imagine you are Charlie, and you are ambushing a group of American''s on that rice patty, set up to ambush them."  The soldiers did what soldiers do- they went prone, usually next to a large tree for protection.  My father-in-law placed C-ration cans in front of their heads and had them move away.  \n\nHe then brought another squad into the same rice field and said, "You are crossing this rice field when Charlie begins shooting at you from that tree line." (where the C-ration cans were). "Shoot back."  They did what soldiers with the new M-16 did- switched them to full-auto and sprayed out all of their ammo on the tree line.  \n\nHe took the second squad to where the first squad had been and told them what the C-ration cans meant and showed them that NONE of the C-ration cans had a hole in them.  None of their attackers had been killed.\n\nBack out to the field he took them.  "Now, keep the rifle on semi-auto, fire two or three AIMED shots to the left of the tree where they meet the ground and then two the right of the tree just in case he is a lefty or he moved at the first shot to the left."\n\nThey did so, and back to tree line they went.  Most of the cans had a hole in them.  He trained each squad this way.\n\nUntil he left Vietnam at the end of his first year his Platoon had the highest body count and kill ratio of any Platoon in Vietnam.\n\nAccuracy by volume is largely a myth.  You may get lucky.  You may not.\nAccuracy by aimed fire is reality.  Aimed shots don''t require luck.', ''),

Its basic variant, Yavuz 16 Regard, is closely patterned after famous Italian Beretta 92FS pistol, although it is also available in several visually different versions. According to available information, Yavuz 16 pistol has passed official Turkish military trials and is in use with certain elements of Turkish armed forces and police.\n\nYavuz 16 pistol is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses Walther P38-type vertically tilting locking piece to lock the barrel and slide. Models such as regard and Compact use Beretta-type open-top slide, while models such as Bora and Zirve used enclosed-top slide with small ejection window on the right. Internally these pistols are basically similar to each other. Trigger of Yavuz pistol is of double action type, with exposed hammer and ambidextrous, slide-mounted safety/decocker levers. Magazines are double stack, magazine release button is located at the base of triggerguard.', ''),

This indicator is made in the form of the pin, which protrudes from the grip into shooter''s palm when only three or less rounds are left in the magazine.\n\n\nI Hope its Safe now even without a safety..  =):cool:', ''),

(106766, ' Salams, \n\nA friend at the range bought the Zigana Sport today and invited me to try it out. It''s a decent looking pistol although as soon as you hold it you notice that it weighs quite a bit more than other pistols at around 1000 grams compared to the Glock 17''s 625g and the Canik''s 850g. The Barrel length is around 5.1 inches compared to the Glock 17''s 4.5 inches and the Canik''s 4.7 inches. The trigger pull is nice weighing in around 4.5 lb''s. In comparison the Canik also has the SA pull at 4.5 and the Glock at 5 lb''s. The slide / frame is ported to reduce recoil and make for a more accurate subsequent shot. Here is some eye candy.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/zig2_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zig1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\nSo since it looks the part and acts the part, is the Zigana really a competition gun ? Well yes and no, it certainly has all the things required from a range gun but here''s something which I often say, no matter how good you are, human error will ensure that there will be the occasional bad shot and to counter this your gun has to be ''forgiving''. By that I mean if you mess up, your shot should still land in black (7) somewhere not go directly to 2 or 3. The Zigana''s trigger is very rigid and ''different''. You mean to squeeze it but it ends up getting jerked. In theory it should work better than the Glock and the Canik but it doesn''t.\n\nThe sights are Novak like and easy to acquire but the shot does not always land up where you expect, infact quite beyond your expectations. In my case I was aiming at dead center and hitting 4''s and 5''s. For myself and the owner, we had to compensate and aim at 12 o clock 7 to hit close to center.  Weird. Below are the two targets I shot with it at 15M. \n\nThe Zigana is a good pistol and is capable of really good groups but if I had an option of choosing between it and the Canik Piranha I would pick the Canik without thinking. It is also important to mention that the sport is just a range gun, it''s too big and weighty to carry around for self defense, while the Canik also doubles as a very good combat gun. \n\nThanks to the Owner Mr. Omer Butt for lending me his pistol. Wish you great shooting with it.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigt1_resize.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Zigt2_resize.jpg[/img]', ''),

In this test,\nthe hands were coated with a layer of paraffin. After cooling, the casts\nwere removed and treated with an acid solution of diphenylamine, a reagent\nused to detect nitrates and nitrites that originate from gunpowder and may\nbe deposited on the skin after firing a weapon.

If you aren''t sure about something, ask the range officers. They''ll appreciate it and so will the other shooters.\n\nNow here are some rules which must be kept in mind.\n\n1)Don''t shoot tracers, incendiaries or armor-piercing ammunition. They can cause fires and damage property. \n \n2)Don''t shoot at someone else''s target, especially if by doing so the angle will make your bullet impact somewhere besides the bullet trap or backstop. \n \n\n3)Don''t break the 180-degree plane; keep guns pointed downrange. \n \n\n4)Don''t put your finger on the trigger before your sights are on target and you are ready to fire. \n \n\n5)Don''t leave a loaded firearm unattended on the bench. \n \n\n6)Don''t uncase a gun behind the firing line. Instead, take the cased gun to the bench and then take it out of the case, making sure the muzzle is always pointed downrange. \n \n\n7)Don''t assume because you watched someone do something that you can do it, too.

For the next test I will modify my grip backstraps because I have a feeling that when ''Tightly'' gripped, the more protruding back strap buldge of the Largest one that I have installed, kind of over lightens the muzzle and I felt it quite jumpy and free floating. More practice will also resolve this issue as it will eventually change my former gripping habbit in the persuit of results.\n\nI choose 15/18/20M distances from the target this time with 10 and 7M for rapid shoot. POF 2Z ammo was the worst in performance from this pistol in this range experience. Chinese was a lot better. UCW Russian was the best so far. But as always, more power to practice as it continues. I have a feeling that POF FMJ vs. 809''s 4.2" barrel did not mate along well provided the gripping technique I am currently using. I have not disregarded POF ammo on this one experience rather I am 99% sure of shooter''s errors on a different ammo which may not be the top accurate load for this pistol. But I do expect it to shoot in a bit modest manner next time than what it did perform on this range test.\n\nFired total of 115 rounds out of which 25 were Chinese, 50 POFs and 40 UCWs. 100% reliability in these 115 shots with no Feed/Extract/Eject or Fire failure. Gun has done with zero malfunctions so far with 165 rounds of its total life, let us see what more we can get in the reliability department.\n\nAs a side note I would like to share that I have been carying this piece off and on these days and it serves well for IWB conceal carry for me. \n\n[b]Target Pics:[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsKYu9r][img]http://s2.postimage.org/KYu9r.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 8 rounds of UCW ammo from 15M, target size 6" dia, group size under 4" between two farthest holes.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxPEHji][img]http://s1.postimage.org/PEHji.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 8 rounds of Chinese White Box from 15M, group size 5" between two farthest holes.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVaZqpi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/aZqpi.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 9 rounds of POF from 15M, there was no relevant group size with these. I used 4 different targets with POF, but the results were similar to this target i.e scattered holes with 2-3 fliers.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVb07Fr][img]http://s4.postimage.org/b07Fr.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 17 rounds of Chinese WhiteBox from 18M, group size was under 7", clustering of shots was quite ok but did not form a subtle grouping.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqmP6ri][img]http://s3.postimage.org/mP6ri.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired 15 rounds of UCW ammo from 20M, group size was 5" between two farthest holes, with 3 fliers which impacted a cm" above the target papers upper boundary.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxPK71S][img]http://s1.postimage.org/PK71S.jpg[/img][/url]\nAbove: Fired rapid in increasing rate of fire, 10 rounds from 10M with 2 shots/sec, 4 rounds from 7M with quicker aimed shots and then 6 rounds from 7M with point shooting style with even quicker follow up shots.\n\nFinal Note: The session was good as I got a bit more familiarity with the new pistol. Hope to carry on like this with new surprises to come :)\n\nRegards.', ''),

(107385, ' My bro.Aquarius \nYou have asked a very interesting question. What is draconian Laws? Any law which carries heavy punishment for small offense.also called Athenian scribe laws.\n There was a king of Hungry, Croatia and Serbia named Vlad the III. His Grand Father âTepesâ created the order of the Knight called Dragoon, means Dragons. These were the Knights who battled against the Muslim in 15th century. Dragons did win some of the battles against Muslim Turks. But, eventually lost and Turks occupied the Eastern Europe for a century or two.\n	 Vlad III,  the grand child of Tepes, was very inhuman, and cruel. He made many laws which were almost impossible to follow. Many Eastern European people were converted to Islam by the Turks around 1431 and these are the Muslims of Croatia ,Hungry and Serbia. \n	Vlad made the laws that anyone who would convert or collaborate with Muslims will be impaled, his favorite method to kill people slowly. He also made several harsh laws concerning everyday crime. For example, a thieve  will be crucified up side down, common criminal were thrown to hungry wolves.  Any criticism of the king was forbidden, and their tongues would be pulled out from their throat. People were not allowed to marry without his personal approval and the punishment was to tie the man and women who did not have permission to be gutted out alive\n	Vlad  was so horrible that he made his sister who disagreed with Vlad, thrown from the palace which he built on the top of the mountain right on to the spears. His atrocities were uncountable, even the Muslim Caliph Omar the first was horrified when he saw the dead bodies decaying on the crosses and spears . The story has that Caliph could not sleep many nights after and returned to Turkey. Muslim called Vlad Draco from the word Dragon and then the famous name Dracula by the other Europeans His laws were called Draconian laws.\nFinally, Vlad III was defeated by the Muslims and killed. His palace on the mountain was made into historical site and now a tourist attraction . Draculaâs palace still exists in present day Romania. I hope that would answer your question for now.', ''),

In my opinion, even the Stoeger Couger is quite large for conceal carry (CC) purposes, therefore, if CC is the ''prime objective'', the all the three above are not good options.\n\nOtherwise, of the three above, I would rate CZ999 and PT92 on top and Stoeger Couger as second.

Good and Accurate piece with some beauty. A very Rough and Tough piece though i had dropped it few times from my hands but no serious issue with that.\n\n2) .33 calibre Chinese pistol with black barrel full metal, distributor are WINAMAX. very powerfull thing but not very much accurate due to its high velocity calibre.\n\n3) Zigana Sports Black and Silver colour with exhaust barrell, Turkish made good accurate due to its long barell, .9mm Calibre but a bit heavy and big size to carry in a concealed manner.\n\n4) Zigana-F Semi Automatic Black Colour the most favourite of mine due to it fine finishing with quite a compact size along with some muscles to fire rapidly due to its built and technology which is similar to Zigana-F Automatic its other version. Turkish made and very accurate also. \n\n5) Stoeger, presently producing in Turkey on Berreta''s dye machinery with Full metal body and revolving barell which reduces the chance of jamming or ejecting a bullet from and inside the chamber. A very much Comapact piece and easy to carry in a conceal manner.\n\n6) American Mossberg Shotgun, Pump action Full metal body, black colour and Plastic body torch below its barell. 12 Guage a very much reliable piece. Less jurk as compare to the other pump action Shout guns. \n\nHope that will provide ease to your questions now. Will post the range reports of the above mentioned weapons inshallah! alongwith the others from my collection and will explain that why i love the ZIGANA-F among all of them with some proves.\n\nThanks again', ''),

Then the beautiful walnut stocks were also made by the great Mistri Yaqeen Shah, and mistri Aseel khan of Darra Adam Khel. \nOnce some one one remarked ''  this rifle seems to be custom made ! and I said yes by ''Yauqin Shaw'' and he said in Austria?

(107860, ' Fully agree with Faheem that a no effort should be made to defame a brand. (I am sure none of us is working for or against a weapon manufacturing company). \n\nHowever, practical experience must be shared as it is; whether it goes in favour of a particular brand or against it. In my view, this is the basic purpose of this site; we share our experiences of the available weapons thereby enhancing our knowledge and understanding. I personally appreciate the fact that brother TT33 has shared with us his firing experience of Taurus 909. This is his experience and certainly not a final verdict but its an important one and must be given due consideration because it is based on firing results. \n\nOn the theoretical side, IMHO, the difference between a good weapon manufacturer and a mediocre one is the consistency in producing quality weapons. Research tells us that even the best companies come out with occasional lemons and even a very mediocre company sometimes produces a weapon which becomes a bestseller. The reputation of Colt or Sig or H&K or Glock or Beretta or Steyer or Kimber etc is good because they normally come out with good / innovative designs and than ensure quality control on consistent basis. In case of a mediocre weapon manufacturer, one model is very good, the other is just average, third one may be a failure and fourth may again be a good one. Within good / popular models, mediocre or average companies have occasional or in certain cases, frequent quality control issues.   \nJust my two cents on the subject..........    :)', ''),

(107974, ' @guns for me. The .22 is a round that serves most purposes that enthusiasts want in a more managable way, like ammo price for instance. It also is good for beginners as it is easy to handle(no big booms, hence less recoil). Its a good way to improve your target before moving on to the BIGGER BOOM rifles(as you would have put it). All in all, i think its a must have for any gun enthusiast.\n\n@Basharat and Faisal. Brothers, please..... you MIGHT be able to hurt a boar with a .22, maybe kill it too if you shoot it a hundred times.... but a .22 IS NOT MEANT TO HUNT BOAR. Do you know why? beacuase the actual projectile does not have enough energy to bring down bigger animals..... i might add here that boars are pretty tough animals. It takes a lot to penetrate the skin a boar, let alone deliver enough damage to bring it down. Please do not be in false notion that a .22 will bring a boar down. [b]DO NOT TRY TO SHOOT A BOAR WITH A .22[/b], it might get you in a very bad situation.', ''),

I will write in detail about it shortly.\nIn 1965 Winchester came out with a Model 70 in which they did away with the Controlled feed Extracter which spelled disaster for Winchester.\nWinchester came back with the Classic Model 70 in 1990 and again tried to capture some of the lost ground in rifle sales.

Short Recoil. Accuracy is superb. The Shop is near the Court. So Shopkeeper charged further Rs. 1000 for The entry and all documentation. With in 1.5 hr. I got a completely registered Arm in my hands. 9mm bullets (Philippines) Quantity 50 and Price Rs. 3000 (Rs 60/bullet)\nNote the bullets were not HP.\nThe shop owner advised me not to use Chinese or POF bullets in this Handgun. \nAfter 2 days I went to Badaruddin and sons in Rawalpindi where Akdal Ghost TR 01 was available Rs. 40K. \n\nLast week I went Peshawar Where Akdal Ghost Price is very much different . Two dealers told me that Akdal Ghost is available Rs. 35K\n\nIn Peshawar the Ammu Rates are very much reasonable. I purchase Philippines HP Quantity 50 at Rs. 3250. (Rs. 65/bullet)\nThe ammo Chinese and POF very at Rs. 40/bullet. Russian 35/bullet\n\nAs am busy these day due to office. So whenever I fired much I will give this forum and detailed info.', ''),

Could you please define it in some tangible terms like the distance from which you fired and the group that you achieved (in inches). Was the group formed close to POA and if it was away from POA, how much? \n\nPlease don''t mind this barrage of questions. Actually i am quite inquisitive to know the details because it is the second report which describes ghost TR2 as a very accurate handgun. :)\n\nRegarding ammo, IMHO, if a handgun does not fire well with POF, Russian and Chinese ammo, which are the cheapest and most commonly available ammo in Pakistani markets, than this is a very serious limitation and must be kept in mind unless one has some arrangement for free supply of ammo from Federal, Armscor etc :)  \n\nThanks and regards', ''),

(108293, ' Dear Apalo before the start of every hunting season wildlife departments publish an advertisement in the news paper to offer trophy hunting. After the advertisement hunters can apply for the trophy permit. Sometimes permits are issues through draw and for some species on first come first server bases. \n\nThere are different species of big game in different provinces that are being offered for trophy hunting. Like Sindh ibex, Himalayan Ibex, Urial, Blue Sheep, Kashmir Markhor, Sulemiani Markhor, etc. But most of these species are only allowed to foreigners. Pakistanies can only hunt sindh ibex and might be urial through legal permits. Rest all black buck, hong deer, spoted deer, bule bull, barking deer, chinkara, etc. all are ban to hunt legally\n\nFor sind ibex the permits cost around Rs. 60,000/- to those hunter who are resident for Sind and for hunters of other provinces the same trophy cost around Rs. 100,000/- \n\nAfter getting a Trophy hunting permits the hunter will harvest his trophy in the presence of wildlife officials. The selection of animal i.e. trophy for hunting is being carried out in consultation with wildlife officials.\n\nThe trophy hunting is being carried out in wildlife game reserves and national parks. In Punjab there are there are types of wildlife game territories for all species. One is Sanctuaries, second is Game reserves and third is National parks. According to Punjab wildlife ordinance no human being is allowed to even visit a sanctuary because they are for game protection and conservation, even at a distance of 1 km from the border of sanctuary hunting is not allowed like Domeli is sanctuary for partridges. Game reserves are those areas where one needs special permits to hunt. Like Rasool is game reserve for waterfowl. National parks are those area where sometimes one can hunt but on special permits and usually national parks are used to see wild animals and sightseeing for common public like Tarkai is a national parts for Urial and some other species.\n\nFurther there is no thrill in trophy hunting for most of the hunter except bring an animal at home the thrill is only for those who claim their trophies in terms of horn lengths and have established trophy rooms in their houses and have lust to collect different species. As one fix time with wildlife official get on jeep reach the game reserve and there are abandon of animals in the game reserve you select one take on shot and bring the animal home. Except a few species but they are in northern area and their trophies are not allowed to Pakistanis and even not affordable.\n\nNow you can well image that how many hunters who show pictures of different trophies on internet hunt legally???????????? But donât askâ¦â¦â¦â¦..!\n\nThe other way of trophy hunting is illegal for this either you need connections at high level or good relations with locals both work wellâ¦â¦â¦â¦..\n\nAnd one more this personal jungle or private land is nothing. if you have a land say measuring 100 acers are there are partridges on you land under law the land the your but partridges are not unless and until you have a declaration and approval of wildlife department to declare your land as a private game reserve. This involves hell of legalities and there are only a few legally approved private game reserves in Punjab. But after the government approval the owner of private game reserve have equal rights on his land.\n\nIf you need any further information feel free to [i][cell number deleted as per forum policy][/i] e-mail at [email]zarar@phsadc.org[/email]\n\nMy dear a common hunter with normal resources can only dream of trophy hunting', ''),

POF used to produce licence copy with transfer of technology but the new entries as MSG and 5.56mm derivates of G 3 are copied and not license production. similarly different versions of MP5 are copy productions. MSG 9 was not accepted in the army because of technicality that is it is a delay blow back  which means that the rifle jumps while the bullet is still in muzzle. accuracy is therefore an issue. quite accurate upto 600 m but so is the scoped G3. so why to go for it. Army is already using Stey SSG 69 and dragunov. POF is now working on Draganov. however MSG is ideal for police and other law enforcing agency. \nAs far as the quality of 9mm para round is concerned it is doubtful until past that is for sure. But strangely this is prominent in MP5 only that to in burst mode. and again no misfire only double feeding. POF is mum about the issue since both are there products.

(108453, ' In my [i][b]extremely[/b][/i] limited experience, I have only known a Taurus (PT609) to fail due to ammo quality (POF 9mm). Coupled with good quality ammo (Serbian Prvi Partizan hollowpoints or Chinese ball); never experienced a single problem. Have shot 3 Taurus handguns, the PT57 (.32ACP), the PT609 and the PT917.\n\nIt would probably be incorrect to say that the Taurus is not very popular outside, specifically the US. Despite the fact that there is a smaller price difference between Taurus and the other "higher" brands, people still choose Taurus, as it often gives them more features for less, compared to the competition. The Taurus 24/7 has (in most magazine reviews I have come across) received quite favorable reviews, which leads me to believe that in Pakistan, the gun is more plagued by ammo quality troubles than any other.\n\nA simple comparison, both Taurus pistols, the PT111 and the PT145, 9x19mm and .45ACP respectively may bring to light some observations. The former (and its variants) have received flak, now and then, for ammo troubles, while the latter is deeply lauded for its performance (as seen from the recent rush to buy PT145s for CC). From my limited knowledge, the .45ACP rounds available here are mostly limited to the high quality, high priced kinds, while the 9x19mm has a host of options, including, but not limited to, Darra-made, POF and Chinese, ranging from premium ammo to substandard bullets. What I glean from this information is that the PT111 may be suffering from the fact that most of us (I believe) use either POF or Chinese for general use, in other words, cheap, affordable ammo.\n\nProfessional reviewers in gun magazines understand that a particular gun cannot equally perform equally with all sorts and brands of ammo, although there are some pistols which are notorious for gobbling up whatever is fed. Each review, usually, advises the potential user to test out his particular gun with a variety of ammo, and reach their own conclusions about the reliability of each brand.\n\nNo, Taurus does not pay me to defend them :D (though I wish they did!), but the fact that my only experience has been with Taurus pistols somewhat contributes to my bias towards Taurus.', ''),

Let''s take this as an example: I carry Brand A ammo in my gun, while you carry Brand B, both for defence. You gun works perfect with both Brand A and B, but even if my gun does not perform reliably with Brand B, it doesn''t bother me because Brand A is the one which works for me, and Brand A is the one I carry. Therefore, my gun may be ammo sensitive in your point of view, but for me, it works perfect, as it does what I want it to do\n\nWhy didn''t Glock didn''t bother to introduce double-actions? Simply because, it worked for them. It sold well, it became popular... BUT, what works for them... might not work for others...\n\nYou believe in a weapon [i]"jo pathar bhi chalai"[/i]. Which is fine, as it is your own idea of how reliable a gun should be. Maybe you would be willing to sacrifice money and features for this reliability. Maybe you like your handguns to shoot whatever you feed them. Maybe I think differently. Maybe I want the features at a lower price, without caring much if the gun in question cannot perfectly shoot a particular brand of ammo that is known to have issues. It''s all perspective.', ''),

No doubt the Glock is more ammo reliable that the Taurus''s polymer/striker-fired pistols. Sir, you are absolutely right when you say that Glock made their pistols that way, which is why they became popular, and which is why they sold well. They were reliable. Absolutely.\n\nBack to why Taurus works. They give the features, particularly the safety lever (which I insist upon) at a [i]fraction[/i] of the price. Compared to the Glock which can fire [i]all[/i] that you can feed it, it will reliably cycle [i]most[/i]. However safe the Glock may be, the Taurus is safer.\n\nMaybe the Glock wins for you. Maybe the Taurus wins for me, simply because it gives me what I need, at a drastically lower price.\n\nThe question is not whether the Taurus is better or worse compared to other brands. The question is whether it fails or succeeds. As far as I see it, it succeeds, and it does so economically, compared to the "better" brands.', ''),

Also note that PT92 is official sidearm of; The PT92 is the standard sidearm of the Brazilian Army beside Imbel 1911, Military Police and ForÃ§a Nacional de SeguranÃ§a PÃºblica (in military service, it is known as the M975 pistol) & in Dominican Republic used by the Dominican Navy.', ''),

And can seniors pls reconfirm that taurus pt92 steel model has this feature? \ni would not mind being provided a link to another thread where this is explained.[/quote]\n\nChrome lined barrel has definately more advantages than plain (non chromed) barrel.\nThe barrel is much easier to clean since carbon and copper fouling can''t stick to the plating like it does in a plain barrels.\n\nThe chrome lined barrel is much more resistant to corrosions and can survive not being cleaned as often as plain barrels.\n\nThe chromed lined  barrel is much less affected by erosion than non chromed, so the barrel lasts longer.\n\nAlso the accuracy of chromed lined barrels is usually a little more than plain barrels...... :)\n\nAnd about the PT92/99 SS being chromed barrel, our seniors have already commented in another thread for which you better look for..', ''),

(108531, ' I agree with KageFox on this that it''s a matter of perspective and entirely depends on how one looks at the things. This will differ from person to person and accordingly, the importance of the same thing may not be same for two different persons. Also important are the habits and preferences that a shooter develops over the years. \n\nI can''t comment on other''s perspective and preferences but in my manner of thinking, I would never buy a gun that is ammo sensitive. And by ammo sensitive I mean sensitive to standard patent ammo which includes Norinco, POF and Russian ammos and not local made darra ammo. I fire a lot and just can not afford to have a handgun which is sensitive to Chinese or POF or Russian ammo. I have seen that these three ammos are not only the cheapest but at least two of them have always remained available, no matter what the circumstances. Therefore, how can I buy a gun which is sensitive to these ammos? (I am talking of my perspective). And during last 25 years, I have fired tens of thousands of rounds of these three ammos from dozens of handguns to know that there is nothing wrong with these ammos and if there is a problem, it is mostly with the gun and not with the ammo because the same ammo fires well with so many other guns. Also, in my personal manner of thinking, I would prefer to carry only that ammo in my handgun with which I practice in routine and about which I exactly know that how will it perform. I would seriously refrain from carrying such ammo in my handgun with which I have not extensively practiced, even if it happens to be the best available and most expensive ammo in the world. And I also know that I just can not afford to practice that much with Federal Premium JHPs as I can with say POF or Russian ammo. Hence my avoidance of ammo sensitive handguns :)    \n\nNow a few words about number of features that a particular handgun offers. My take on this is that lesser the features, more simple and reliable the handgun. So I would personally prefer a reliable, accurate and rugged gun with minimum of extra features and would try to avoid handguns which offer so many complicated features which do not contribute much towards enhancing the reliability, accuracy or ruggedness of that handgun. And if you see best handguns ever produced like Sig P226, Browning High Power, CZ75, Glock 17 & 19, Beretta 92fs, Makarov etc, they are all very simple handguns with only essential extra features. Armies and LEAs all over the world preferred them and still prefer them because they are all reliable, accurate and rugged. Will deliver when required with all types of ammos even during worst of circumstances. That what we need from a handgun, IMHO. \n\nThis is my personal perspective. I understand others may have a different perspective on the subject and may feel equally assured about the correctness of their perspective as I do about mine. After all, we are all here to share our experiences and preferences so that we can learn from each other and not to prove that who is right and who is wrong. :)', ''),

It produces what Armed Forces want it to produce and not something which is selling well in the market. It has a long time affiliation with H&K only because a long time back, Army decided to adopt weapons manufactured by H&K. Should Army decide to change its weapons, POF will also accordingly develop the expertise to develop those weapons, regardless of their commercial value / status. \n\nAs for the low efficiency and foresight as an organisation,  this ill is peculiar to most state owned organizations; POF being no exception is certainly not the most efficient organization around.  Off course there are many areas where POF can and should improve, most important being modernising itself as per the requirements of time.

[b]Similarly, an open internet forum may not be an appropriate forum to discuss inside working flaws of POF, which some of the members seem to know, perhaps in their official capacities. And if some members from forces have complains about the quality of POF products being supplied to their outfits, this certainly is not the forum to raise this issue.

Sigma pistols bear so much similirality to Glocks, that the lawsuit was rised against the S&W, so Smith & Wesson finally paid undisclosed sum (some millions of $$$) to Glock for violation of their patents, and then S&W received the rights to continue the production of Sigma line. \n\ntechnically, Sigma pistols are recoil operated, locked breech semi-auto pistols, built on modified Browning-style linkless locking principle. All Sigmas feature Glock-type single action-type trigger with automatical half-cock and manual striker cocking during trigger pull. Sigma pistols had no external (manual) safeties. Gun frame is made from polymer, the slide and the barrel can be manufactured from the stainless steel or from the carbon steel (in so called "Value" models). \n\nIn 1999 S&W improved the Sigma series. Main change was shortening the barrel and the slide by .5 inch (12.7 mm). Other improvements included more comfortable grip checkering, slightly enlarged ejection port and addition of the acessory rail at the front of the frame (under the barrel). \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsfwPMr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/fwPMr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsfwZL0][img]http://s2.postimage.org/fwZL0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Tsfx3Ki][img]http://s2.postimage.org/fx3Ki.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

These are very reliable guns. Even once I had a Pak 92FS clone, I fired hunderds of rounds without FTF with PAF & Norinko, I think any of our seniors should feed different type of ammo and determine what sort of ammo cause problem and why? This may be due to pressure, dirty gun, size of cartridge, magazine lips, sepatately purchased mags, old ammo, quick firing, ejector spring or nose and a number of other reasons.

(108754, ' Russia continues to gradually open its defense market for foreign manufacturers. On May 6 Russian Technologies Corporation, a giant state-controlled industrial and defense holding, announced its plans to launch a joint venture with Italian small arms manufacturer Beretta. According to the Corporationâs head Sergey Chemezov, the JV may start its work in the beginning of 2011 and will manufacture hand guns for police and intelligence agencies as well as hunting and sporting weapons. These weapons intended for both domestic market and export will be the first foreign small arms manufactured in Russia since WWI.\n\nThe JV will be located in the town of Vyatskie Polyany, Kirov region, at the facilities of a Molot plant controlled by Russian Technologies. Molot used to manufacture Kalashnikov RPK light machine guns, automatic grenade launchers and ATGMs. But now Russian Technologies plans to restructure its small arms assets that also include Izhevsk-based Izhmash and Izhmekh companies. âAll military products will be manufactured at Izhmekh and Izhmash while Molot will be repurposedâ, mentioned Chemezov.\n\nAccording to Kommersant daily, the annual sales volume of the new JV is to amount to 35 million euro. It will manufacture 160 thousand firearms a year, including about 60 thousand military handguns. The agreement between Russian Technologies and Beretta will be reportedly finalized in May.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqN7dar][img]http://s3.postimage.org/N7dar.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(108814, ' [quote=MIdreesTaj]It is best to find the most reliable and accurate load for any gun and practice with it later on to fill the cause of gun keeping in us civilians. i.e SD/Sports etc. Suppose your Beretta 92FS is able to eat any.. any load you can recall how ever you still will find the best one and go ahead with it for whatever purpose you''re using it, be it sports or SD.[/quote]\n[b]I absolutely agree with this argument till the time it is related to accuracy.[/b] Off course, a particular gun may fire more accurately with a particular ammo and a shooter should endeavour to find that out. That is why we see that in the quest for more precision and consistency, top shooter finally end up reloading ammo as per their or their handgun''s liking and do not normally use market ammo. \n\n [b]However, the same philosophy can not be applied to the reliability of a handgun, IMHO.[/b] Say if a gun, if tested with 10 different types of ammos, fires well with 7 types but has stoppages with remaining three, we must first check if other reliable handguns also develop stoppages with these three ammos. If they do, the ammo is faulty. If they fire those three ammos well than there is no problem with the ammo. The problem lies with the gun. We just cant get away by saying that ok, don''t fire these three types of ammo and you own a very reliable handgun. I see it this way that there must have been some design or manufacturing flaw in this particular handgun which caused these stoppages . With the same ammo, the stoppages did not occur in the other guns. \n\nTalking of my personal experience, I have fired thousands of rounds of POF, Chinese and Russian ammos with Taurus PT99, CZ999, Baikal MP446, NP22, Beretta 92fs, Llama M82, Walther P38, HP77B, Glock 17 & 19 and many others handguns and never faced any problems, except may be one odd occasional stoppage out of 1000 or even more. Firing the same ammos with Taurus 24/7 pro, Akdal Ghost (both TR1 and TR2) and few local made clones, I encountered frequent stoppages, both failures to fire and failures to feed. With CF98 and Stoeger Cougar, I encountered very occasional stoppages (may be one out of 150 or 200 or even more). [b]So what should be my final conclusion; \n[/b]\n1.  I should stop using Chinese, POF or Russian ammo because it does not go well with few handguns. \n\n2.  I should stay away from these few handguns and keep using Chinese / POF / Russian ammo because it is cheap and I can practice more with cheap ammo. \n\n3.  Buy Federal or Armscor ammo for these few handgun and compromise on less practice due to the higher cost and fire Chinese / POF / Russian ammo with all other handguns because they have no problems with these ammos? \n\n [b]I leave it up to the readers to see where the life is easier and accordingly make their own decision[/b] :)', ''),

(Heckler and Koch has instituted a spate of lawsuits lately against anyone copying any of the weapons they developed from the CETME, which is itself an outgrowth of the StG44 assault rifle developed by the Nazis in World War II.)[/quote]\n\n\n\nGOOD info Basharat bro', ''),

At least you go for a Maverick. Its recommended by senior Shotgun Experts of PG.\n\nAnd your question that why you cant use Slug with a DSA or other Pak made Shotgun. Brother, the simplest answer I can give is Why Winchester Defender costs 100K and DSA 20K ?\n\nYou can ask for a gun from DSA which should be of Same Quality as its motherproduct the Mossberg 590 or Mossberg 500. They will make one for you to use SLUGS but the cost will be same as the Mossberg 590 is. \n\n\nRegards,[/quote]\n\nThanks Mig for great info.\nand thanks for correcting my spelling mistake; I will always remember your kindness sir.', ''),

It would be worth trying but seeing the pics, construction of inner parts and specifications, it appears to me that most Sig P226 parts should fit in NP22 but not in CZ999.  However, unless one tries, nothing can be said for sure. Conversely, almost everything in CZ999 is slightly different from Sig P226 hence not compatible. :)', ''),

(109112, ' Local Darra or other local factory 9mm ammo produced here is of lower standard and will affect in 3 major ways:\n\n-Primers, used are WW2 type, corrosive ones having Potassium salts which embed onto the bore surface and erode the surface. Propellant charge, used is of low quality and has higher concentration of errosive compounds that tend to foul the bore with excessive residue. Cleaning such barrels immediately with a proper procudure becomes mendatory or they form rust in no time.\n-Propellant charge is not carefully measured, peak pressure levels vary per shot and can be felt and heard in that way. Chances of failure to function slide properly (retarded slide) followed by stove pipes/failure to extract and eject. And chances for squibs(under powered round not able to exit rifling and stuck inside barrel) which could result in kabooms.\n-Bullets are not made from guilding metal in the core and proper copper alloy jacket. Differences in bullet seating depths per round and over all lengths. Differences in bullet weights. These bullet will not snuggly fit the bore diameter resulting in varied pressure peaks inside barrel which will result in un-timed cycling of slide or retarded slide cycling. This will result in inaccuracy, diminished range and stability of the bullet during flight. Also due to lack of proper copper alloy jacket which is made of other harder materials that is closer to scrap iron, these bullets tend to slip through the rifling lands without clinging onto them. Also they tend to be very harsh on rifling rather very very harsh. The chrome lined barrels will take more of these but eventually chrome lining scraps off with usage, these bullets will do the process in 1/4 time.', ''),

Lets for an example take barrel and its CAM/breech sections are different in structure altogether, the frame inserts will automatically be different due to this. Same with the slide rails and internal dimensions they not exact copies like out of same dye.\nAn expert gunsmith can drop in a barrel which requires slight milling and re-touch, where barrel is already been made for that particular gun.

(109304, ' Just thought this article from the net belongs here\n\n"\nMost people who choose to carry a firearm for self defense will, sooner or later, have someone ask them the question, "why do you carry a gun?". Sometimes it will be asked accusingly by an anti-gun person seeking to ridicule them. Other times it will be by someone who has been lead to believe that guns are bad and the people who carry them are, but they''re not really sure and are genuinely curious.\n\nThere are lots of reasons why someone would decide to carry a gun. For some, it is because of their job, like a police officer or bank guard. It could also be a person who regularly carries large sums of money for bank deposits. Those are obvious, of course, and not the ones that usually get questioned.\n\nSo why would an ordinary citizen want to carry a gun? The anti-gun crowd will tell you it is because of paranoia or that they want to feel big and powerful. I''ve never found either to be the case. For most, it is because they want to feel safe. But I''m not really talking about just the fact that a person who carries a gun thinks they can win any fight. Most of us know that criminals rarely strike with warning and the best you can hope for is a fighting chance. Though, that''s a fighting chance you don''t have if you''re not armed.\n\nThe feeling safe argument does come into play, though, and is particularly relevant to outdoorsmen. It can be very comforting while fishing in bear country to be carrying a firearm. Similarly, a woman riding the bus alone at night is going to feel much safer with a .38 in her purse than a rape whistle.\n\nMore than that, though, it is a feeling of safety that is born out of confidence. Think about it this way. If a person doesn''t know how to swim, they''re likely to be more afraid of being out on a boat than a person who knows that if the boat does sink, they have the skills to survive. It''s the same thing with a gun owner. They know that if something did happen, they have a tool and skill set available to them to up the odds for survival.\n\nFor others, it is a sense of responsibility. Here''s another example. Let''s say you''re having dinner in a restaurant and the person at the table next to you starts choking. A skill like the Heimlich maneuver would save that person''s life. Some folks feel they have a responsibility to their fellow man to learn lifesaving skills like that. For some gun owners, they do feel a responsibility to protect others, but for most it is more of a responsibility to protect themselves and their families. Taking accountable for your own safety and well being is something that used to be expected in this country. Now, it is more common for that obligation to be passed along to someone else, whether the police, the government, or a higher power. However, there are still plenty of people who still choose to be responsible for protecting themselves and their loved ones themselves.\n\nWe all know that, for most of us, the odds really are low that we''ll have some violent criminal try to break down the front door at two o''clock in the morning. But if it does happen, wouldn''t you feel safer if you had a tool and a skill that could stop the intruder from killing your, your spouse, or your children? I don''t think it is paranoia to want to be prepared just in case. After all, isn''t that what they teach Boy Scouts, to be prepared?\n\nGetting back to the misconception about gun owners being paranoid, I think it is actually more likely that a non-gun owner is going to be paranoid. A person who legally carries a gun has the confidence that he or she can handle themselves and doesn''t usually even think much about a criminal attack. They know that if it comes, they''ll be ready. However, a person who has had half of the "fight or flight" responses taken away is much more likely to be distrustful and afraid of people they meet on the streets or jump at every bump in the night.\n\nThose are just a couple of the reasons some people choose to carry a gun, but there are many more. I do know a few carry simply because they can. The Constitution says they have the right, Ohio law makes a concealed handgun license available, so they do it. There''s nothing wrong with that. Rights are like muscles, if they''re not regularly exercised they tend to atrophy.\n"', ''),
(109305, ' And for Icing on the cake the following article\n\n"\n[b]Come on, Please, Try to take my guns.[/b]\n	\n\nThere will be much bloodshed if anyone ever trys to take my guns and leave me defenseless.\n\nIf you do manage to pry my gun from my cold dead hands you will quickly find yourself on the receiving end of a hail of bullets fired by my spouse and/or other family members from one or more of the many loaded guns lying randomly around my house.\n\nYes that''s right I DO NOT lock up my guns! What good is a locked up gun when a prowler wakes you up in the middle of the night? What are you supposed to do? Say âWait Mr. crook while I find my keys to unlock my gun cabinet to get my gun and load it.â\n\nOne time, many years ago, soon after I moved into my current home, I was awakened by the sound of a prowler on my porch. This prowler found himself eating dirt while a volley of AK-47 rounds tore up the trees just above his head. In the 18 years since that night I have not had one single prowler on my property while all my neighbors around me have been robbed numerous times. By the way I reported the incident to the local sheriff who came down and took a report and thanked me for the report and admired my AK-47, it was the only on in the area at the time. (It is a semi auto version and perfectly legal to own where I live.) What are people thinking when they own a gun for self-protection and then keep it locked up?\n\nMy guns stay loaded and ready at all times, by the bed, on top of a cabinet, under the sofa, beside the phone, on top of the computer, in my pocket, and other miscellaneous places around the house. And yes I have children in the house. I have raised many children, my own as well as others and they all know what a gun is and how it works and could, at anytime shoot any gun in the house of their choosing. The only requirement is that notify an adult before taking a gun outside to shoot, and it has always been a standing requirement in our house that we are available to supervise kids shooting at any time, anything else can wait.\n\nIt is the most awe inspiring thing in the world to watch a 10 year old rip off 30 rounds from an AK-47 that is almost as large is he is, or watch him load cock and shoot a pistol hitting a target dead-center without any help.\n\nThe common misconception is that a gun lying around a house will result in a kid dieing. This is not true! What results in a kid dieing is fear, mystery, curiosity, and ignorance in that order.\n\nLet me explain this way. For example letâs look at a scenario that has played out many times.\n\nKid finds his dadâs gun hidden in the closet and kills his best friend with it while playing âCops and Robbersâ.\n\nThe gun didnât kill that kid; the four items below are what killed him.\n\n1 Fear; We are afraid our kid might turn out bad or get hurt so we must hide this gun in the closet.\n\n2 Mystery; why do mom and dad tell me to never get in their closet.\n\n3 Curiosity; Mom and dad are gone to the store, lets see whatâs hidden in that closet.\n\n4 Ignorance; Wow a gun just like on TV letâs play with it.\n\nBANG dead kid!\n\nAs you notice the root cause is the fear of the parents,\n\nIn my house this could never happen, hereâs why.\n\n1 Fear; we do not fear guns, they are nether evil, or good, they are tools, nothing more. Tools are not hidden in dark mysterious places!\n\n2 Mystery; since there is no hiding there is no mystery in our house, (well maybe a little but whatâs hidden in the chest beside the bed wonât kill anyone:).\n\n3 Curiosity is seeking the unknown. Since guns in our house are out in the open and not a mystery there is no unknown and no reason to be curious abut them.\n\n4 Ignorance; This, is the GREATEST killer. EVERYONE in our house has seen what a gun can do and understand that a gun will BLOW you apart!\n\nOne of the first lessons I taught my kids when they were old enough to understand is the following; I set up a couple if melons in the yard and explain that the melon is just like a human head with brains in it, I then load a semiautomatic handgun with hollow point bullets in front of them and shoot on of the melons. Viewing the âbrainsâ of that melon scattered on the ground, they very quickly grasp that you donât want to be on the receiving end of a bullet. I then remove the clip and hand the clip to them so they can see that I took the bullets out of the gun. I then ask them if now that the gun I have is unloaded can it still kill you or is it safe? Invariably the answer was it is safe. I then, without another word turn and shoot a second melon with the âunloadedâ gun, blowing it apart. The expression on their face shows me that they will never forget that even an âunloadedâ gun can and will kill.\n\nThis system has worked for me for 24 years and I have no worries. So who is the Jerk, the person who by encouraging ignorance denies his child the ability to protect himself from the dangers in this world that he will sooner or later face, or the man who imparts to his children knowledge and understanding, and the power to protect himself, as well as the understanding that this world is a dangerous place? \n"', ''),

(109307, ' Nazim sahab, I appreciate your insight. Thanks for taking the time to elaborate on your points. Aside of carrying weapons, lets get to one''s needs/places where one should consider himself safe, and I mean when one does NOT have known enemies. \n\nGenerally speaking, if I go to the busiest, largest market in Allama Iqbal town, lhr where noone but families and normal good folk are going about their business, unsuspecting of any outcome that would make it the last day of their lives, would you say thats a safe place? Recall Moon Market lhr. A restaurant where good folk just go to relax with friends and family. Safe? plz recall the Marriott and Luna Caprice. With the current situation of Pakistan, where I live, and hence take to be my framework of input for making my decisions, I can recount literally hundreds of incidents in all kinds of places where one might NOT consider carrying thinking they''re safe, but they''re not safe, are they? By the same token, even Law Enforcement personnel who carry weapons for a living aren''t safe. Recall countless attacks on police stations, military check posts, FIA offices and so forth, all over Pakistan. I feel i can say, anywhere from my own home to the Military General Headquarters isn''t a safe place in Pakistan, based on real incidents that took place. \n\nThis establishes two things: \n1- My need or threat assessment process concludes that I am safe absolutely nowhere. How can I then create a list of places where I shouldn''t carry? How can i create a list of places where I can or cannot go? Again, I have no known enemies and don''t think am a ''gainful'' target for kidnapping. btw, +1 bros Faisji sahab and KageFox sahab for explaining it far better than i ever can\n\n2- Bringing a concealed weapon into the equation. I agree that in some situations, a tool, such as a gun or knife may not save you, but in these situations, not having these tools also won''t. Additionally, by not carrying, any chance or advantage you might have had, you deliberately forgo! I won''t make that decision. So, in a fight for my life, (which is no remote possibility) having a weapon MAY save my life. Not having it will DEFINITELY not!  +2 Faisji and KageFox bros\n\nIn conclusion, when anyone from the head of state (jhanda chichi blast, pindi) to high ranking military and government officials (countless accounts) to a commoner such as me (Nov 28, 2009 house break in, theft) isn''t safe, I will consider always carrying concealed UNLESS the law of where i am expressly forbids me. Only there I will either surrender my sidearm or leave is secured in my car. And this pretty much is what the purpose of this topic has been :) I agree with you that pulling a gun on a street phone-jacker will in most circumstances be wrong, according to the LAW (not necessarily according to what I think). If i shoot such a person to kill, then as far as my understanding of our "uncomplicated" law, that would be murder because i didn''t satisfy the stated pre-conditions of the constitution where use of lethal force would be justified. But this is a question of sensibility, right? Not one of carrying or not. I hope I''ve been able to clarify my position. I''m sure i speak on behalf of many, if not all my country-folk.', ''),

And a pleasure to preserve your thoughts on the matter.\n\nWhen i mentioned terrorism, it was specifically divorced from carrying or not carrying a gun, just my case of explaining how i differ from you on places of safety/unsafety. Inside a restaurant, fine. What about on the way to it on the road? etc. Emergencies/accidents are so called because you don''t see them coming. I agree that during the incidents in Marriott etc, someone being armed (assuming Marriott even allows it, which i doubt) wouldn''t have made a difference, but would it have been a better choice to not be armed? How? Why terrorism is different from a bolt of lightning is because it is committed by people. Lets not theorize, but there is a remote chance that people can be stopped. I don''t want to forgo that fighting chance. Baqi may Allah always protect us and our families from the ills of the world.\n\nWhats most important is that one''s decisions are informed based on valid input and in making them he is rational, on the right side of legal, with every purpose that will be in the benefit of himself, his family/friends and the community at large. In that vain, after reading your comments, I feel we generally agree on most things but have come to slightly different courses of action as a response, which, it is my prayer, will serve each of us well individually, inshallah.', ''),

Nor have we observed any common "firing pin breakage" history anywhere.\n\n5) Different .45 ammo gives same imprint, thus it''s not even ammo related as such, yet a "character".\n\n[b]We agree with you however[/b], that there [b]IS[/b] an "undue" friction somewhere between the firing pin and the shell during ejection process, but this got to do something with the [b]FAST AND SHORT movement of the slide[/b] during which the firing pin obviously does not manage retracting to the canal fully, not due to any spring weakness.\n\n But then, bearing in mind, that the firing pin itself is perhaps the "hardest" of components within a handgun, this minor "timing issue" has not given any negative/detrimental issue anywhere with the PT 145 whatsoever, hence we are of the conclusion that it could rightly be called a "character". \n\nThanks anyhow, for bringing this notion to lights and the opportunity to invite a discussion on this "trait".

You will coordinate with the seller to bring his gun to the dealer of choice (as mutually decided). The dealer will take the gun off the seller''s license and then put it on the buyer''s license. If the buyer already has a gun on his license, he will also take that off first. It is up to the buyer (of new gun) to either sell his old gun to the dealer or ask him to hold it for sale (as amanat).', ''),
(109533, ' quoting from a website\n\n"\n[b]Shooting The Makarov\n[/b]\nShooting the Makarov takes a few tricks to remember that may differ from other guns. First, always make sure the safety lever is ALL THE WAY down before firing. I''ve seen a couple guns where the safety could wiggle up just a hair causing the hammer to be blocked from hitting the fire-pin.   Forcing the safety down hard to "fire", when this occurred corrected the condition.\n\nAs far as accuracy goes, the gun is very accurate as it incorporates a fixed barrel design. I''ve always shot 45''s fairly well by paying attention to pressure points in my hand resting solidly against the gun.  The Makarov ergonomics may require a different method.\nPressure Point 1. Inside of thumb - bone presses firmly inward against gun frame\nPressure Point 2. Index Finger top knuckle (where finger attaches to hand) firmly against frame\nPressure Point 3. Heel of hand presses against bottom of pistol grip - DON''T DO POINT-3 WITH THE MAKAROV. With the Makarov, for accuracy shots, try holding it like a cup of tea with the heel of the hand not pressing against the grip. It might feel like the gun is floating a bit, but this seems to prevent some twisting of the gun as the trigger gets squeezed.\n"\n\n[url]http://www.bobtuley.com/makarov/[/url]', ''),

(109536, ' @ New_b,\n\nAsalamualaikum and a warm welcome to PakGuns.\n\nYou have a valid problem which needs to be addressed urgently. I''ll try to answer your queries to the best of my knowledge, but I''d like more knowledgable members of our forum to correct me without hesitation wherever I am wrong.\n\n[b]1) Regarding acquiring a license without having permanent address:[/b]\n\nYou do have a CNIC and on it you must be having a permanent address. So, apply through a dealer located in the area in which you permanent address is located as per your CNIC. Get an MOI license because these are all-Pakistan and you''re not confined to keep this weapon within any specific province.\n\nThe MOIs are currently closed, but the rumour is that they will reopen soon (within a month or so). For more information about how to get an MOI license, read our MOI thread in detail in our Club House section.\n\n[b]2) Security of your family members:[/b]\n\nWhile you wait for the MOIs to open and get a license, secure your rented home and make sure that security measures such as intercom at the front door (maybe one with a camera), good quality locks and bolts for the main doors, iron grills for windows, etc. are in place. Also consider installing an alarm / siren system at your home which can be activated on the push of a button. The blasting sound of the alarm / siren helps in alerting neighbours that there is robbery / dacoity in progress and enabling them to alert the police plus it also helps is disorienting the robbers / dacoits and forcing them to consider leaving the house immediately.\n\nIf you still can''t wait for the MOI licenses to open up, check whether it is possible to change the permanent address on your CNIC and then apply for a Provincial License, which are still open in Sindh and take about two weeks to one month to process ''normally''.\n\n\nIf you do not mind my asking, just for my information, which locality of Karachi have you shifted to ?  No need for full address, just the Area and Block (For eg., N.Nazimabad Block C or Gulshan Iqbal Block 9 or PECHS Block 2, etc) would be fine. Maybe I can give you a localized advice once I know this.', ''),
(109537, ' Marksmanship, is comprised of Accuracy (the ability to hit), Power (wound potential, to stop\nthe threat), and Quickness (the ability to hit before it is too late.). and for these reason one has to practice alot. but how would he know that he is practicing in the right direction and where he is required to practice more, for his purpose every one who wants to be a marksman and is a potential marksman should learn the art of TARGET READING.\nEven a service-grade pistol will shoot a golf ball sized group at typical combat distances, slow fire. Shooting faster will see that group open up, but it should be no bigger than a large grapefruit or perhaps wide-open hand, and remain centered on the target. Groups that get abnormally large indicated that the shooter is focusing on the target, not the front sight. \nAND THIS IS HOW TARGETS ARE ANALYZE AFTER THE SHOOTING SESSION.\n\nso few basic guidelines for hand guns marksmanship TARGET READING are ......\n\n\n12 o-clock groups indicate "heeling", pushing away with the heel of the hand at firing, or\nraising the front sight too high when shooting at distance. Combat zero should be 2.5 inches\nhigh at 25 yards\n9 o''clock indicate the firing wrist or grip is offset to the right, or trigger is pressed wrong, or\nsupport arm is moved out and upward.\n3 o''clock, too much gripping pressure and twisting to the right, often in DA auto pistols.\n6 o clock, mash instead of surprise break, or increasing firing hand pressure as the trigger is\npressed. Keep separate from PIP (post ignition push) IF the hits are still good, timing will\nbring the gun down in recoil.\n10-11 o clock indicates a lack of follow through, such as starting to reload too soon.\n\n\n\nAND AT THE END I LL SAY AGAIN THAT IT IS ONLY PRACTICE THAT WILL IMPROVE THE MARKSMAN INSIDE YOU.', ''),

(109665, ' AoA Everybody\n\nIt is rather easy to think that since NP22 is a Sig clone, one can buy the inexpensive Chinese clone as a base and build a fine pistol using after SIG P226 parts. truth of the matter is that its a pretty long shot if not next to impossible.\n\nhere is why:\n\n1. the locking mechanism on both guns is totally different as Norinco modified the locking block to include a portion of the rails as well.\n\n2. drop in barrels are precisely machined and tolerances can cause serious problems if both guns do not come out of same manufacturing plant/machinery\n\n3. SIG P226 has undergone several modifications over the years (not visible to the operator at first glance) whereas NP22 is based on old/early Sig design.\n\n4. importing gun parts (key parts atleast such as barrels and mags) is next to impossible without proper documentation.\n\n5. if one can import SIG parts, surely he has the ability to import the whole gun. so, might as well import a complete SIG.\n\nas far as CZ999 is concerned:\n\nit is not a SIG clone, it merely looks like one. to be honest if you take a closer look, you''ll see that even from external appearances there are minor differences that can compromise the whole "dropping in SIG parts" dream. as far as internals go, the similarity they share is like Apples and Oranges.\n\nMy humble opinion:\n\nanything that looks like a SIG does not mean that it will function like a SIG. the only benefit to owning a NP22 in my opinion is that it makes CF98 look like a classy high-end handgun.\n\nRegards.', ''),

I read in one of the posts where our American friend Steven Cline mentioned that he fires about 10,000 rounds at an average every year. Now that''s the kind of fire where problems like locking blocks etc come up and one needs to replace certain parts. Not in Pakistan, I reckon.

Females are only legally shot where there is an over population issue and even then they are permitted to be shot either as baits or as part of management and not as trophies. \n\nThe main aim of trophy hunting program is conservation of the very specie that is being hunted and this is achieved by taking old males that have past their breeding prime as they would already have passed their genes and they don''t have much further to contribute. The first Urial being displayed in this post is an example of such an animal and one that a hunter should feel real proud in collecting. Also, the funds that are generated by trophy hunting fees goes into the conservation efforts thus providing benefit to the wildlife.  \n\nHowever, there are rules for trophy hunting and they are notified to hunters when they obtain their hunting permit, these rules are there so that wildlife is not exploited and to insure that there is no negative impact of trophy hunting on the game population. Under the Trophy hunting notification a Trophy Urial is considered to be a male with 24 inches or above horns and trophy below 24â if shot has to be confiscated by the game department and penalty being imposed on hunter. Also, use of Shot Gun is strictly prohibited. Any one with even a little bit of trophy hunting knowledge will know about the legality of these hunts being posted here and I will leave it to that but it is indeed very sorry sight seeing babies and immature males of Urial being blasted by shotguns and displayed.', ''),

(109756, ' [b]Contribution by his Royal Highness\n[/b]\nQuote:\n\nHi,\n\nI travel quite a bit within the country and prefer to carry a piece with me from time to time. Since I do all my purchasing here in Lahore I also sometimes need to carry weapons for my security staff in other cities. Most people I meet are quite surprised to find that I am able to carry weapons so casually in this day and age with so many airport security checks. I''m surprised at the fact, how can you not ??  If your weapon is legal and you are the license holder it''s TOTALLY LEGAL to transport your weapon to other cities (provided you have a all Pakistan license).\n\nHere the procedure. When you enter the airport (not the drive in/parking, the main door)  before you put bag with the weapon in the scanning machine, tell the security person there that you are transporting your weapon is in that bag. He''ll ask you to show your license. Show your license and a copy of your ID card. You''ll have to show him your gun, he''ll compare the gun number with the license, enter it in a register, enter your ID card info along with your flight information and ask you for your signature. Once that''s done lock the bag and he''ll come with you to plastic wrap machine, get your bag sealed (free of cost) and then accompany you and the bag to the flight check in desk and oversee you check in the locked bag with the gun. That''s it, just pick up your bag normally from the baggage line when you reach and you''re done!\n\nI''ve even gone so far as to transport gun boxes without bags and pick them up from the baggage lines although it''s fun to see people''s expressions at the baggage line seeing guns next to their bags lol\n\nPart 2:\nI would like to update that I carry routinely from all major airports of Lahore, Karachi, Isb. Just remember not to carry more bullets/cartridges then the allowed limited on your license, that can cause some issues.\n\nUn Quote\n\n[b]Another Valuable Procedure by Blood Bath:[/b]\n1. Go to ASF control room which is located at the departure of every airport ..do this to avoid confusion cause at times the alertness level is red-alert and you might end up in a mess..so got to the ASF contol room and tell the duty officer that you wanna carry your licensed weapon in "hold baggage".\n2. He will depute a person with you and if things are normal will tell you to go to the "Hold Baggage search counter" or the first search counter...remember you have to declare your weapon if you forget... the x-ray baggage screening machine will.. and the operator will ask you to show the license for the weapon.\n3.  They will take you to one side and will tell you to open the bag and show them the weapon,,they will telly the license with the small arm and will make the following entries in the "arms register"\n     a.     Caliber of the weapon\n     b.     Make and type\n     c.      License number\n     d.     Number of magazines and rounds.\n     e.     your all personal details\n     f .     flight details and all\nthen he will call a guy from "PIA Security" this guy is responsible for inspecting and verifying the weapon for safe custody he is also responsible for locking the bag in which the weapon is kept the bag must be locked and strapped and there should be no round in the magazines and also there should be no magazine in the gun. The PIA Security guy will then book the baggage on your ticket and will give you a baggage tag. One copy of the baggage tag will be pasted infront of the arms entry in the arms register by the ASF guy. now the PIA guy will personally escort you bag till the baggage make-up area and then to the aircraft and will personally out it in the top priority pellet in the plane.\nNow once the plane lands you have the weapon bag amongst the first few cause of the accorded priority. You give the PIA people your tag and off you go.\nPlease remember that do declare your weapons if your weapon is accidentally not detected by the big x-ray machine (hold baggage) and is subsequently detected at the hand baggage search counter you will be declared a high jacker and its damn serious,,,,\n\n[b]Valuable Input by Skeeter60[/b]\n\nTraveling by air with weapons.\n\nTake a paper and write down the following details;\nName,\nAddress, Mobile number\nLicence number. Date and Place of issue\nFlight Number\nWeapon number and make\nNumber of cartridges/bullets\nWhen you reach the scanner declare there are arms /ammo in your box. and hand over the paper to the ASF person on duty.\nIt will be a great convenience for him to have all information ready. Show him the Licence.\nAsk him to call the security person on duty, immediately.\nThis guy is usually roaming somewhere and takes time to show up.\nThe security person ( he is other than ASF ) will check the weapon and ask you a silly question that is this a bara bore when it may be a rifle ) he will then put a steel wire around the lock and the box containing your  weapon and ammo.\nYou proceed to the counter where the luggage and weapon containing box is deposited by the security person in your presence and the tag numbers  and your seat number are passed on to the ASF.\nMake sure you arrive at least 30 minutes earlier then the regular arrival time\nCarry the weapon and ammo in a hard box or leather/canvas case which is lockable and has a lock with keys ready in your pocket.', ''),

(109778, ' One small piece of advise that my father gave to me when I carried a weapon for the first time by air.  My father lost his baggage on a flight from Karachi to Quetta and in the bag was his expensive pistol. He turned every stone until he found his baggage. Stating his experience he said that the lower staff at the airport knew about the weapon and may be they tried to steal it or the whole luggage.\n\nSo as advised by my dad. i always tell the airline representative that I will hold him fully responsible if my baggage(which contains a weapon) gets lost and also ask him for his visiting card. This I guess makes him bound to make it sure that he personally takes notice of the baggage movement.\n\nThis happened with my father about 20 years back and I guess now a days because of the high security, airport staff cannot think of doing such a thing but I still follow this advise.', ''),

You are not going to get this over night.\n\nThe VHF radios, of 5W, hand held type, are also not allowed. All frequencies are allocated, and you cannot transmit. You can only receive, so scanners are allowed, and we have grown up having fun with them especially when mobile phones in Pakistan were AMPS. For VHF, one also has to go through FAB.\n\nAll comms frequencies in Pakistan belong to Ministry of Defence, who chair the FAB. Then specific frequencies are de-allocated from MoD and licensed to a specific user. There are strict punitive actions against people violating the airspace. Its monitored, and people are caught and their radios broken.\n\nI would suggest, if you want to have a personal communicator, go to Circuit City or Best Buy, and pick up these Moto Comms sets that work in civil open use FM band. They work fine for 2-3 miles depending on terrain and you should be fine with it.\n\nYou can sneak almost everything through customers, but why take the risk?\n\nI hope this helps.', ''),

I mean are there any options floating in the market under that price tag? \n\nI dont expect to fire it a lot and would therefore not want to spend a lot but as an SD weapon would prefer that it is trouble free and reliable :) \n\nFrom what I have gathered pump are more reliable but is it possible to get a repeater which i can cosnider in that price tag??', ''),

(109925, ' [quote=Naveed_pk]@Lionheart bro You are confusing a little their is 2 model One GAmmo Shadow 1000 and Second is Gammo Delta 640 ... Hope it is clear now :)[/quote]\n\n\nActually, Lionheart is quite right. There are/were 3 models of the Gamo commonly seen in the market. In increasing order of power: The Delta, the Shadow 640, and the Shadow 1000. The Delta is the compact one, with a polymer outer on the barrel, the Shadow 640 has a sort of a gray-colored polymer body with black inserts at the forearm and the Shadow 1000 is the full-size, black-polymer bodied one, which incidentally, many members of this forum, including yours truly, own.\n\nA fourth Gamo, the Hunter 440 was available a couple of years ago, which was essentially, a Shadow 1000 with better micrometric sights, a wooden stock and a better aluminum dovetail/rail.\n\nMr JuGno, you would best be served by a Delta or a Shadow 640, as brother Lionheart wrote above. I myself have little experience with Chinese B2/B3, but apparently, it is held in high regard by the esteemed members of this forum.\n\nAs for a scope, well my suggestion, if you are a first time air gun shooter, is to get acquainted with the iron sights, and then move on to a scope.\n\nI believe these links will help somewhat:\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1968[/url] \n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3608[/url]\n\n[i]Note: Apparently, other members replied while I was typing my post, so I deeply apologize for repetition of information[/i]', ''),

When the cartridge is in its backward motion, it strikes with this ejector pin (its always located approx opposite to the extractor catch), and the cartridge flies off through the ejection port. :)\n\nHope I explained it clearly enough!', ''),

Like 24/7, has a great grip, as good as one can get. Is very well balanced and has medium recoil. During the accuracy test, the pistol proved moderately accurate. Was very accurate from 10 M but its accuracy at 20 and 30 M was found slightly below the expectations. During the test, there were no stoppages, however, after the test there was one misfire with POF1Z ammo. The cartridge did not fire even on second strike. The cartridge with two strikes was extracted and fired in a CZ999, and it went bang, no problems :)', ''),

(110280, ' SA sahib, IMHO, the test should remain standard for all guns. My reasons are as following. \n\nAccuracy, as a factor, is quite tangible and can be measured with fair degree of correctness if the parameters are kept standard. eg, This test should be able to show that Handgun A is capable of making a 2 inch group at 10 M, Handgun B is capable of making a 3 inch group at 20 M and Handgun C is making a miserable 5 inch group from 10 M. So this factor is tangible and can be measured. After the test we have the data, worked out on standard parameters. Now this data can be used by the user in the manner that fulfills his requirement.\n\nNow comes the question that a subcompact gun will generally not be as accurate as a long barrel full size gun hence it is not fair to conduct same test for both. My take on this is that the accuracy test should remain standard for both. Now it is up to the user to decided that what is his requirement. \n\nIf he is looking for a CC handgun than he should be more interested in 10 M test and maximum 20 M test. The gun should be making 2-3 inch group from 10 M and may be 5-7 inches from 20 M. \n\nIf one is looking for a full size pistol than it should be accurate at 20 and 30 M. And if he is looking for a match or competition pistol than it should be dead accurate even at 30 M. \n\nWhat we should not do is that lower down accuracy standard for a CC gun. Means we should not accept a 6-8 inches group from 10 M in any case on the pretext that I am going to shoot this handgun at a very short distance so I don''t really need an accurate gun. \n\nNow as we have seen in the previous tests, certain sub compact handguns like Makarov and compact handgun like Glock 19 and CZ75 have performed far better than much larger handguns like Beretta clones, Akdal Ghost, CF98, NP22, Kanuni S, Chinese TT, Taurus PT809 E etc. [b]So size of the barrel has not really made much of difference.[/b] [b]The overall quality of construction, which included so many aspects like slide to frame fitting, quality of the barrel, quality of the trigger, quality of sights etc etc contribute more to the accuracy of handgun than merely its overall size.[/b] Therefore, a well manufacture 3.5 inch barrel handgun may perform far better than a 5 inch barrel pistol with mediocre construction.  \n\nI hope I have been able to convey my point :)', ''),

Aside that fact, still this particular CF98 which PsiFactor owns is a very well made piece. Take another CF98 and it wont be as accurate as this one. \n\nTake another instance of any pistol, if the first instance was very accurate there is more probability of the second instance not being as accurate as the first one. This is because economically friendly  combat handguns vary more in terms of accuracy per piece, than the pricey ones. \n\nReason being tolerances and precision in production of parts. Like there is no two barrels of same caliber and model of firearm having exactly same characteristics no matter how precisely they are made. They do vary. True with the slide and frame to some extent but mostly the barrel is the main concept here. That is, The Barrel, its fitting and its relation with the sights installed.\n\nThe match grade pistols have all these aspects very well controlled but not still perfect.\n\nBTW about russian Wolf ammo, it is well known to be a very accurate round with moderate velocity.', ''),

(110410, ' Zeroing a handgun is matching the Point of Impact with Point of Aim.\nOR\nTechnically, zeroing is your line of sight should intersect your bullet''s trajectory well at the point of Aim\n\nThere are two factors which are not constant throughout the process (keeping in mind that same firearm is used), one is Distance and the other is Bullet (you might be shooting at varied distances also you might be using different bullets)\n\nDistance for an instance, lets say affects the whole matter. Your bullet while on its flight has different positions on its way with respect to its flight path as the distance increases. The greater the distance, lower the bullet will fall. Bullet fired straight in line towards a target will never hit the point of Aim rather it will hit lower due to pull of gravity. The barrel has to be risen from the straight line of aim a little bit to land your bullet on desired point which is your Aim.\n\nBullet is the other major factor, which can have different characteristics depending upon its ballistics/terminal performance. In simple words, the bullet weight, bullet shape and ballistics of the specific rounds being fired translates into bullets having different flight paths yet fired from same firearm.\n\nPlease Note: In a typical combat handgun which most of us are likely to use, distance might not matter that much as typical range of engaging a threat might not exceed 20-25 meters and will mostly stay inside 15 meters. A 9mm bullet has enough of a flat shooting character with in these ranges. \n\nOn ther other hand, bullets having different (weights/shapes/material) matter more than distance (SD scenario) as these will drastically change your point of impact. Same is in the case of rounds of same caliber having different internal ballistics e.g moderate/hot/hotter loads. Also heavier bullet spend more time inside barrel having lower velocity than lighter bullets if the round''s internal ballistics are kept constant. They resultingly impact higher than point of aim due to muzzle flip at the time of recoil upon firing. Lighter bullet will shoot to the point of aim or will shoot lower if the sights are zeroed for heavier loads.\n\nNow the complete zeroing consists of lateral and vertical adjustment of sights to confirm Point of Impact with Point of Aim. In fully adjustable sights both kind of movements are possible hence zeroing can be done real time with some perfection. However on most service/combat type handguns sights are fixed type, i.e not fully adjustable. They are partially adjustable. That is, the sight can be adjusted only with lateral movements. Some sights have screws on them which let them loose in the dovetail (the channel in the slide where the sight is plunged in) and they can then be adjusted. However most sights dont have screws rather they are only plunged in the dovetail. These sights require manual work for adjustment. Slide is fixed in a catch and the sight is punched using a sight pusher.\n\nLater method is how a CF98 can be zeroed as it is a fixed sight pistol and only allows for lateral sight movement using a sight pusher. Note that, this will allow you to adjust your point of Impact horizontally only. For vertical adjustment of bullet impact, you will need to consider your Sight picture Or will require to change/modify sights.\n\nAlso please do not try to do it yourself, you can easily ruin your sights and slide cosmetics and will regret on it later. Ask some smith who knows how to do it without damaging anything on your gun.', ''),

(110412, ' Dear friends,\n\nThe latest update is that I''ve been trying to arrange a meeting with Dr. Inamullah through his son, but been unsuccessful so far. The purpose was to discuss with him the approach and possibilities for establishing the club. Since, one of my probable sources has been unsuccessful, I intend to contact him through other sources now. Will start working on this from Monday inshaAllah. If anyone here can get a meeting arranged with Dr. Inam, that would be great.\n\nWith regard to the thought process, I have been thinking about the following:\n\n1. Start off with a virtual club. The purpose of this club would be to mobilize some basic funds (with a nominal donation per member, say 1,000/- or so) to arrange a couple of workshops on the subject and collect some basic information on enthusiasts from Peshawar. If we want to move ahead on this subject we will need a good number of people that are willing to pitch-in in terms of their efforts, finances, contacts, sources etc. A meeting of some reliable enthusiasts from Peshawar or surrounding areas is a must.\n\n2. Talk to the concerned government authorities (including FC, DCO office - Arms Section etc.) in Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa (KPK) about the necessary procedure required and the possibilities that can be explored (including providing some facilities for private citizens at the FC club).\n\n3. Meet with senior representatives of the National Rifle Association (such as Dr. Inamullah) for getting thier guidance and views about how to proceed.\n\n4. Identify a suitable place for the club. Any space in the vacinity of Peshawar that can provide a rifle range and space for skeet/trap shooting would be appropriate. The handgun and air gun ranges can be accomodated within the same space.\n\n5. Once the procedure and plans are more clear, we can start contacting bigger corporate sponsors to help us gain leverage in the government and of course provide the basic start up funds.\n\nPlease share your views on the above... and any other ideas that you might have...', ''),

(110415, ' The perfomance of Dr shahib with a what is basically a combat pistol is although incredible by no means unattainable for ppl who shoot regularly.By the time a shooter reaches around 15000 rounds in life time they have developed muscle memory for targeted shots and i am pretty sure doctor shahib had crossed that mark long time ago.\n\nThis type of shooting has more to do with shooter than the guns the shooter remembers the target,can visualize the flightpath of the bullet and then use appropriate muscles and nerve synaptic to fire the weapon on target and deliver the shot on target.Ordinary shooters have hard time make vision meet the reality and thus fail at muscle control.Only practice brings this kind of perfection.\n\nI have seen a active duty SSG major do a 1.5 inch group with 5 shots at 25 meters with a NIB TT while shooting single handed.It muscle memeory as these guys send large amounts of bullets downrange every week so they have excellent muscle-mind connections.', ''),

Frankly, I was expecting a harder recoil from such a small frame gun firing .45 ACP. But the recoil was very manageable and one hardly feels that he is firing a .45. Sights are good and allow quick aiming. There were no stoppages whatsoever and at the end of the day, I inspected the strikes on all the primers. It was a solid strike every time. The trigger of PT145, however, is not really very smooth and there is room for improvement. As for the ergonomics, like most Taurus guns, they are top class indeed. \n  \nOn Denovo sahib''s special request for a sub-compact handgun, PT145Pro was tested from 7M as well but the results have not been included in the final aggregate because I want to keep the testing method uniform. \n \nNow apparently, this final result is not mathematically very impressive.

I have therefore summarized the performance of all handguns tested so far in this post. I have also categorized them as per their size / use. The purpose of doing this is that though all handguns are being tested using the same procedure, their accuracy results do not carry equal values in my view. For example, a score of 65% by a sub-compact gun may be far better than a score of 70% by a large frame gun. Mathematical values are good as they describe the results in tangible form but in the end, members should carry out their own analysis keeping in mind their own peculiar requirements for a handgun.

However, seeing its final form now, I realise that it has somewhat become a result card kind of thing which speaks good of certain handgun guns and also bad of certain handguns. Please keep in mind following aspects while going through this summary...................\n\n1.  This by no means is a final result of some kind of ACCURACY COMPETITION held between these guns. [b]Neither these tests are the perfect / most scientific tests for judging the accuracy nor this should be taken as the final performance of a particular brand of handgun.[/b] \n\n2.  I realise that the results of those handguns which I have been firing more over the years or I own are better than few other guns. This is natural. So please don''t get carried away too much with the mathematics. If Handgun A is scoring 77.11 and handgun B is scoring 74.34 than it does not necessarily mean that handgun A is better. Perhaps both are of same category . If PT99 and CZ999 are on top of the list than it does not mean that these are two most accurate pistols around and are better than say Glock 17 or few other because these have scored better percentage.  However, it does mean that both of them are accurate handguns and can be trusted for accuracy :) \n\n3.  Few handguns have performed really bad. This again does not mean that all specimens of this brand would perform the same way. May be the one I tested was a lemon or its sights were way out. [b]But one thing is for sure; there is some serious problem somewhere.[/b] So please keep that handgun on your watch list and check it thoroughly before making a decision to buy it. \n\n4.  [b]Please do understand my limitations as a human being as well.[/b] I will never be able to give a standard performance everytime because it is humanly not possible, only machines can do it. Accordingly, the results may slightly vary for different handguns but not too much. \n\n5.  [b]This, by no means is a marketing campaign for a few handguns and a dumping campaign for the others.[/b] You may consult this as a reference but finally make your own decision while you are buying a handgun, keeping in mind your requirements and pocket. \n\n6.  Therefore, [b]these tests are not a most scientifically conducted final verdict on a particular handgun, however, they do provide a tangible basis for judging one of the most important characteristic of any handgun; its accuracy.[/b]  \n\n\n\nThanks and regards :)', ''),

Reason why I''m asking this is that the 145Pro which I have is DAO, while the rest of PG''ers have DA/SA ones. \n\nDo you think there is a difference between accuracy of DAO and DA/SA handguns (same gun, same model, same everything). The DAO only model''s trigger pull is measured at 6lbs 15ounces but smoothens up to 5.5lbs after a few hundred rounds.\n\nRegarding the results, what I take from it, considering the sub-compact close-range pure-SD purpose, the 7M, 10M and 20M would be something I would be looking at, and like you highlighted above, it''s an Accurate Handgun at these ranges.\n\n\n@ Denovo,\n\nBrother, thank you so much for taking your goodies all the way to Gilani Sb despite your ill-health.

(110644, ' [quote=SA]One query. What has your experience been with respect accuracy of Double Action Only handguns. Reason why I''m asking this is that the 145Pro which I have is DAO, while the rest of PG''ers have DA/SA ones.\n\nDo you think there is a difference between accuracy of DAO and DA/SA handguns (same gun, same model, same everything). The DAO only model''s trigger pull is measured at 6lbs 15ounces but smoothens up to 5.5lbs after a few hundred rounds.\n\n[/quote]\nSA sahib, thanks for your comments. \nTechnically speaking, DA or SA trigger does not effect the accuracy of a gun. However, practically speaking it does, for those who are not very well used to it. Longer trigger pull cause shaking / flinching etc which finally results in a misplaced shot. IMHO, those of us which are more familiar to a DA/SA trigger (which most of us are), will find it quite difficult to fire accurately with DA trigger unless they practice a lot with it. \n\nMoreover, if you notice, most competition or match pistols have SA triggers, generally ranging from 2-3 lbs, depending on the liking of the shooter. It ensures better trigger control and allows the firer to completely focus on the front site, which is so very important for accurate shooting. Conversely, many people prefer DA only triggers for SD. That perhaps is the reasons that Kahr (which specialises in manufacturing high quality CC handguns), has DA only trigger on all its handguns but that is a smooth and high quality trigger. \n\nYou will have to practice more to get fully accustomed to a DA only trigger :)', ''),

(110664, ' [quote=KageFox]@Gilani: A very useful compilation, sir, provides a rough estimate of the accuracy potential of the guns at a glance. Though I was surprised to see the Taurus PT99 having a slightly higher overall score than a target .22 pistol, in this case the famed Ruger Mark III.[/quote]\nPlease go through the Ruger Mk III results and you will find detailed answer to your question. Ruger underperformed because the sights were not zeroed as per my liking (zeroing differs from person to person). On the other hand PT99 sights were zeroed to my requirements hence it performed well. But I am convinced about one thing; while Ruger can score better if I carry out another test after properly zeroing it, PT99 is no ordinary handgun. It''s accuracy is close to a match pistol, far better than most other combat pistols available in Pakistan nowadays. Skeeter60 sahib also remarked the same when he fired with my PT99 the other day.  \n\n \n[quote=KageFox] To add to your marvelous article, I would like to state that the accuracy of the gun(s) in question is also affected by the number of shots one has already put through it... in other words, a familiar gun will usually outperform a newer gun of the same standard.[/quote]\n[b]Actually Sir, IMHO, better familiarization with a particular handgun does not enhance the accuracy of that hand gun. The accuracy stays where it was.[/b] It actually improves the results achieved by a particular firer with that handgun. (this is what you also wrote in the end). And I have already highlighted this aspect in my detailed post above that result of those guns with which I have fired a lot is slightly better than the ones with which I have not fired much. But the difference is small, not too much. I fire thousands of rounds every year and fire a variety of guns in routine. It does not take me much time in getting accustomed to the trigger / sights / grip / recoil of a new handgun. But still, some difference would always remain because I am a human :)\n   \n\n[quote=KageFox]In gun magazines, accuracy tests are often done with Ransom Rests, in order to remove the human element from the accuracy potential of the gun in question. However, results of such a test are not able to reflect the handling qualities of a gun, something which can be seen, to a certain degree, in your tests. [/quote]\nTruly speaking, I did not use proper rest in the first test because I could not get one. And after having carried out a number of tests without a hand rest (while resting the elbows on a table), I thought it would not be fair to carry out remaining tests while using a rest. Now I see another advantage of carrying out the tests without a rest which you have also highlighted, ie, it gives a result which is closer to off hand firing results. \n\nThanks for your views brother.

Price-wise also reasonable at 50-52K. :)\n\nAs for more detailed impression, you know, it''s hard to say anything about a gun that has not been fired by yourself, but from what appears on the surface, it''s a considerable item indeed, and as of maker history, you know Sarsilmaz is one established Turkish maker in the quality department.\n\nThe gun is widely in use by Turkish LEA''s, has an ALL STEEL/ALU frame and slide, a reasonably tight slide/frame connection, very unique finishing. Label it with any European/U.S name, you cannot tell it''s a Turk!\n\nLength is [b]210mm[/b], which should be slightly above 8 inches, barrel is [b]118mm[/b], which I believe is +4 inches, weight is [b]990[/b] Grms [b]WITHOUT[/b] mag! It''s a heavy item as such, basically due to the ALL STEEL composition, a Beretta 92 I believe is something like 940 grms. It''s a 15+1 Shots model.\n\n12 Gauge bro yesterday had reservations for it due to the weight, yet I tried a "hand feel" impression of both, the CZ 999 in one hand, the Kilinc in the other, and I personally did not feel any SUBSTANTIAL difference, deeming also the bit of "extra" weight somehow "beneficial" in the recoil segment. He however was of the opinion that it would give "wrist pains" on excessive use, I cannot say anything here. :) \n\nPersonally I''m of the opinion, it''s a nice solid item, a substitute for the PT 99/92fs, if one should want something out of the "tradition", yet i must say, it looks better than the PT 99.\n\nMay I add, it''s a CZ-75 off-spring, perhaps with a similar " natural point-ability" construction, and once again, what even 12 Gauge bro couldn''t dispute on, it''s wonderful "feel" in the hands.\n\nSome weeks back, while talking to Chief over the phone, I felt somewhat a "discrete" approval by him for this model.\n\nP.S...........Having written all above, a bit of "thorn in the side", heck there''s no "decocker", but a manual safety. You''ve to lower the hammer manually, yet it''s SA/DA both. :)', ''),

Construction, slide to frame fitting, price etc and finally, how do you rate it. \nthanks[/quote]\n\n\nEven though the question is not directed at me but kindly allow me the liberty to answer  it.\n\nKlinc 2000 light, though labeled as a light weight version of the klinc 2000 mega, was as heavy as a brick. it had a very slim profile (almost like a TT) that made me wonder where does all that weight come from. If i were to guestimate, I would say, he gun weighed atleast 1.5 to 2KG. leaving the weight issue aside, the best thing about the gun was the trigger which made it qualify in flying colors as an absolute POS. :)\n\nRegards.', ''),

(110733, ' I had the pleasure yesterday of seeing Aquarius bro for the first time in person, when during a shopping trip, accompanied with the pleasant profile of our "Pulau tomb raider", 12 Gauge bro, I met Ilyas and Aquarius bro in Peshawar.\n\nThe trip was basically an "ammunition stock program", and 12 Gauge bro kindly picked me up here in Wah, along with "mini" AK, my son, who just happens to love his PG uncles and insisted on a visit to the "Dumbaa" land! :lol: \n\nWe reached  Peshawar via the Motor-way at around 11.am, stopped first at Fakhre-Alam for some nice window shopping and ammo collection of some 300 .45 cal rounds, and a couple of hundreds of 9mm''ers, which Aquarius bro had very favorable pre-arranged for us. May I add, Fakre-Alam indeed has ONE GREAT VARIETY of weapons, ask for anything, a box of that will quickly be tabled before you! I''ve posted some items from there in the "Window shopping" thread.\n\n Aquarius bro met us here, and I must say, he''s one nice, soft-spoken gentleman we really enjoyed lots with. He has an immense knowledge into weapons, and to "some" extent, I could feel yesterday a PT 145 "crave" in him, when he time over and again would take mine and place it in his "dubaa" beneath his shirt, to feel how really it does conceal well there! :lol:\n\nI believe we''ll soon have another PT-145 entrant soon, Aquarius Sir! ;)\n\nAnyhow, the trip continued towards Hayatabad, where Ilyas bro was waiting to join in, and we went quickly through the famous Sitara Market, where I did manage to find a few "stars", in the form of a unique "Grip" for my rifle and some "rail covers" I had been looking for since long.\n\nThe rifle "Grip",may need some "modification, but 12 Gauge bro has promised some "work-shop" help.\n \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVQY0fr][img]http://s4.postimage.org/QY0fr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nThe Rail Covers (for Picatinny rail fittings):\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVQY7JS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/QY7JS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nHunger was "striking", especially "mini AK" who just wanted a "dumbaa" served for him right away, dead/cooked/alive, so Ilyas and Aquarius bro quickly arranged for the lunch over the phone, which was ready when we reached the spot on the Ring Road, and on our way, course, managed to have 12 Gauge bro''s "Pulau" packed from Baba Wali to be consumed at the "Dumbaa" spot! \n\nBoth guys, 12 Gauge and my son, if we''d delayed their lunch for another say 15 min or so, would simply have shot us with the CZ  999, they even liked to move around for themselves on the streets of Jamrud, cursing the other 3 of us for "waste" of time with weapons and ammo, heck it was the "food" they both travelled 350 Kms for!: lol: \n\nAnyhow, Ilyas really knew a very good spot, I''d never before considered on my frequent Peshawar visits, and indeed it should be tried by any of you if you''re around in Peshawar, it''s unique  in taste, and from the outer "facade" of the spot, you wouldn''t guess what tasty delicacies they really do serve in there! :P\n\nSome pictures: \n\nMy son picturing 12 Gauge bro''s "impatience" for the "Pulau"!\nAquarius bro in the background, discussing with Ilyas bro and me. The Gun is a G-19, I believe Aquarius bro''s, since both Ilyas and Aquarius bro''s were loaded with these yesterday.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxFlijJ][img]http://s1.postimage.org/FlijJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nFrom [b]Right to Left[/b], 12 Gauge bro, my son, Aquarius bro, Ilyas bro.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqcsMS9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/csMS9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxFodUi][img]http://s1.postimage.org/FodUi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nMy son, 12 Gauge bro, Aquarius bro and myself.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVR2g_r][img]http://s4.postimage.org/R2g_r.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxFoPjr][img]http://s1.postimage.org/FoPjr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nWe really missed KK, about whom Ilyas bro told me that he was busy with some urgent work, would really have loved to see him around, perhaps next time, even if I''ll have to "invade" his farm! :lol:\n\nOverall, it was a very nice trip, Peshawar was a bit "hot" yesterday, but still fairly pleasant and we managed things fast and fully. \n\nI really appreciate the great hospitality of Aquarius and Ilyas bro, for giving us all of their precious time and showing us around in Peshawar, it was really a pleasure to see and chat with both them, and I owe them great hospitality anytime soon they''d honor me with a visit to my area.\n\nThanks Ilyas bro and Aquarius for all your love, especially for your very kind and loving care shown to my son, I really appreciate your gestures beyond expression.

(110821, ' Asak ,\n\nsalam and hello to all members .  you uwill find the folowing reviews interesting\n\nIt''s been 3 months since I got the gun and I hadn''t made it out to the range until Friday. I had to requal with my duty gun and shotgun for in-service so there I was all day long shooting in dim light, flashlight courses, duty qual and shotgun course when after long last, lots of waiting and enough shooting to turn me off to the sport for about a week when the range session was finally finished for "official department business" and I could play.\n\n\nNow I say all this to lay the ground work that I didn''t want to be at the range and I was just turned off to guns in general when I shot the AR-24 but when I did It was actually pleasurable. My shooting hand was sore, I didn''t have enough sleep the night before, I hadn''t eaten any breakfast or lunch and I needed to pee by the time I got my AR-24 out and still it was so much fun I just kept loading the magazine again and again. \n\nI shot about 80 rounds or so through it and there was no hick-up. \n\nThe gun has no recoil. That is to say shooting it is like knocking on a door. There''s just nothing unpleasant there in the grip at all. When you shoot it there is just so much slide mass that there is no muzzle flip to speak of and the 9mm is a pussy cat round in a gun this heavy.\n\nThe sights were lacking and will have to be replaced. There''s just nothing nice I can say about the sights, they don''t belong on a gun. I shot low at 7 yards by 2" but the groups were so tight that the target I had was almost useless. \n\nThe gun was so accurate that I had to shoot an index shot, and then just put my other bullets as close to that first hole as I could. Folks, this gun can make a ragged hole. Even at rapid fire, IDPA speed, I was still fitting all shots in a group the size of a girls fist at 7 yards and I''m not a competition shooter. I put the gun in the hands of a IDPA competitive shooter, Rick Simes, (semi pro competitive shooter and range hustler) He seemed to like it but the trigger out of the box we agreed could use a gunsmiths touch though for a new gun, the trigger was mighty fine. It was probably around 12 pounds double and about 6 pounds single with a noticeable hump as you stage the trigger. \n\nAdvance Plating and Weaponry will fix the sight issue by fitting a new set of sights to the gun. It is a manufacturers defect in my opinion but that''s why they make adjustable sights. \n\nRick encouraged me to sell it to him when the "new" wore off. I was quick to tell him this gun will be buried with me. He just blew me off saying it would be a safe queen.\n\n\nHe''s right. I''ll be buried with my GP100. GOD after all prefers revolvers. \n__________________\nMAXIMUM ANNIALATIONIFICATION \n\n2nd review\n\nArmaLite wanted to update the gun a little cosmetically and bring it back to the US market, so they worked with Sarsilmaz to develop the pistol you see here. The final product''s slide might be familiar to fans of the Sig P210. One feature lots of people loved was the fact it could be carried "cocked and locked" like the 1911 although I always wondered why someone would buy a double-action and then not take advantage of the system. One advantage it does have over the 1911 is with the hammer cocked and the safety engaged it is still possible to retract the slide and unload without disengaging the safety. When the hammer is down, engaging the safety effectively secures the action since it prevents the hammer from moving, thus locking the slide. There is also a passive firing pin safety, but it is missing the magazine disconnect or mechanical lock everyone seems to love to hate. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator.\n\nThe three main components of the AR-24, barrel, flame and slide, are all machined on modern CNC equipment from solid forgings rather than castings as were used on some clones. ArmaLite reports the raw forging for the flame weighs over 3 1/2 pounds before it is machined. The finished frame, complete with guts and grips, weighs only a tad over a pound. A generous beaver-tail spreads recoil nicely and both front and backstraps have 20 lpi checkering. Some variations will have serrations instead of checkering. Grips on this test gun are wood with cut checkering, but later versions will have plastic grips The grip has a pronounced-and very comfortable palm swell on both sides and they extend outside the frame a little, which provides a great place for your thumb.\n\nMechanically there does not seem to be any differences from other CZs and fieldstripping is exactly the same. It is worth mentioning because it is a bit different from more common designs. On the left side of both frame and slide are a pair of witness marks just forward of the hammer. To fieldstrip the unloaded pistol, all you have to do is draw the slide back about 1/4" to align the two witness marks and then push the slide stop pm out from the right. The recoil spring and guide are not a captive unit so a bit of care is needed when removing it.\n\nShooting the AR-24 was properly uneventful and it shot without protest a wide variety of 9mm ammo including some less than stellar handloads I found in the junk box. The CZ-75 has a great reputation for reliability and the AR-24 does nothing to sully that. At around 500 rounds through the test gun there have been no stoppages or malfunctions of any kind.\n\nIn fact. I shot the ArmaLite for fun over and above the obligatory function and accuracy test because of the combination of good sights and nice trigger. The test gun has adjustable sights with the typical three dot pattern. but fixed and tritium illuminated sights are also available. My custom is to weigh triggers when I first get a gun and the initial 5 1/2 pound reading for the single-action was about what you''d hope for in a service pistol, but it was quite smooth and was no detriment to accuracy. Neither the single-action nor double-action pull weight changed with use.\n\nAccuracy was impressive, too. In my experience, stock 9ram service pistols average 3" to 4" 25-yard groups, but as you can see from the table the worst single group was only 3.04" and the average considerably better. Most of us are going to plink with guns like this, too, and good accuracy never hurts.\n\ni hope u find these reviews useful .', ''),

(110874, ' Up next, an original Gerber LMF II survival knife for helicopter pilots/crews. The category on this is A.S.E.K, ie Aircrew Survival and Egress Knife. The blade is 4.8" and overall Length is 10.5". The serrations are employed to be able to cut through chutes/chord, seat belts/fasteners or nylon threading etc. It fits its sheath solidly. A bit too solidly. Even entry/exit from sheath leaves markings on the finish. On this one though, the condition is fairly decent and the final price was negotiated to Rs. 2000, which for this market (only), I paid a bit begrudgingly\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/16-ger.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/17-ger.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/18-ger.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/19-ger1.jpg[/img]\n\nThe sheath incorporates a perfect edge angle ''v'' shaped sharpening stone system within itself. A great great benefit. Sharpens to scary extent well and accurately\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/19-ger2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab48/Krynheim/Survival%20and%20Tactical%20Knives/19-ger3.jpg[/img]\n\nThe buttcap can be used to break plexi glass to exit downed choppers etc. The blade is full-tang, by the way, or very nearly so. The buttcap is electrically isolated from the rest of the blade. Deliberately without giving details, this knife has been used to cut electric wire without threat to the person holding/cutting in a nightly ambush in a war. This is just a great knife!', ''),

(110877, ' Up next, two tactical folders. The Benchmade 635 Mini-Skirmish and a Boker tactical tanto, the series of which is not known to me. Benchmade seems to be a variant of the original 635 design (now discontinued). The original doesn''t have serrations and the reverse of the blade carries the designer''s mark and the ''S30V'' steel indication. This might''ve been made at a non-US subsidiary of benchmade. The knife is too solid and finely crafted to be a replica. The Boker, I can bet is genuine. The blade carries the Solingen mark and is from the (now discontinued) Tree brand series of Boker knives. The weight and solidity is extremely satisfying. This has a smoothly engaging liner lock. The lock on the Benchmade is the proprietary frame lock of benchmade which they call a mono-lock.\n\nOf course, I being a thorough self respecting geek, took apart both knives. Cleaned and lubed the mechs and now they deploy like the breeze.

Regarding you import query so brother at least what I can confirm you in this regard is;  you can bring an air rifle with you from UAE and this is the only nearest possible place but you well not be able to get much of a differences in prices what you are experiencing here.

This is what has happened in our Thar desert, where 95% of Chinkara population is lost because of indiscreet shooting.\n\nHarvesting of an old male like the above has a good effect on the population as this allows younger and sexually stronger males to breed with females resulting in larger number of offsprings from a herd. However, if you kill a female then you have not only killed her but also effectively killed all the offsprings that she might have in her life time, which in a Chinkara and Urialâs case is one or two every year and also the offsprings of the offspring. \n\nAlso, if you start killing young and immature males before they have a chance to pass their genes then that gene pool is lost forever.\n\nWe as hunters have a responsibility that we make sure that the very animal that we love to hunt has a chance to survive. This will not only allow us but our future generations to continue hunt these magnificent trophies. \n \nFurther, a hunter with the help of a good binocular can judge an animal up to 400 yards to an accuracy that shouldnât be off by a couple of inches that is not a problem. If an animal needs to be judged further then that, a spotting scope should be used. A good spotting scope will allow you to accurately judge an animal up to 1000 yards, no problem here. \n\nI hope that the next time our fellow Pak gunners go hunting, the success of their hunt should not depend on the killing of an animal, rather they should enjoy the experience and only shoot if they find a trophy even half as good as the above one.\n\nThis is just my two cent of advise.', ''),

(111190, ' Wonderful news PsiFactor... Will get in touch tomorrow inshaAllah.\n\nThank you for your vote Sonnenkind. I''ll elaborate on your point after a few updates as they are relevant to your question:\n\nUpdate: I had a meeting with one of the Managing Committee members of the Islamabad Gun Club today Lt. Col (Retd.) Raza (who has served as the President of the Army Rifle Association for over 20 years) with reference to our subject; he is also the administrator at the club. He was very happy to learn about our endeavour but was at the same time dissappointed in the role that the Peshawar shooters and enthusiasts were playing in the sport at the national level in terms of their participation. He shared some good points and made some calls here and there to facilitate me including an MNA and former activists in the shooting field Arbab Zahir, who confirmed that not much was going on in Khyper Pakhtoonkhwa (KPK) with regard to shooting. He shared that the government had alotted land through the Army for one shooting range (to be used for general public) in each of the four Provincial capitals, under the authority of the respective provincial rifle associations. As such, the Frontier Rifle Association was allotted a piece of land near the Peshawar airport runway (which we now generally know as the FC range). I shared with him that the general perception about this range in Peshawar is that it is not open to general public and private citizens, which he negated. He said that due to political differences, the club was not functioning as it was initially envisaged to service. And the FC has been given mainly an administrative role, which means that the range is not only meant for the FC! It is not closed to public. \n\nI also shared with him our plan to meet Dr. Inam, which he supported as he could not only play the role of a mentor, but also a facilitator in the capacity of the Frontier Rifle Association General Secretary. Lt. Col Raza further shared the following course of action:\n\n1. Supported the meeting with Dr. Inam;\n2. Meeting with the IG or DIG FC regarding the FC range services for private citizens;\n3. Meeting with the provincial minister for sports Mr. Aqil Shah\n\nTowards the end of the meeting we agreed that we should first determine the status of the FC range and its services. If for whatever reason (political or security etc.) this plan fails, then we will identify a private range. In a response to one of my questions he also shared that for the later option, we will need to have permission of the provincial home department. As you can see, Col Raza''s suggestions are inline with our thought process so I''m glad to know that we are on the right track.\n\n... Now coming back to your question Sonnenkind: Allow us to meet Dr. Inam and a high up in the FC first. If things don''t work, we shall arrange a meeting of enthusiasts in Peshawar to develop a work plan for establishing a private range. Thats when we will discuss initial donations, if at all required.\n\nIn the meantime, I request all members to bring onboard other enthusiasts and shooters to this forum so that they are also aware of the developments and can be informed for future events in time. In addition: Please provide the following information either on this forum (if comfortable) or email it to me privately on [email]mkkdurrani@gmail.com[/email]:\n\n1. Your full name and location (city or town would be enough)\n2. Occupation\n3. Email address\n4. Phone number (preferably a cell number that you mostly use)\n5. Interested to be trained/compete in which dicipline of shooting? Choose from [Air pistol / Air rifle / Rifle / Skeet / Trap / Double Trap/ Big Bore Handgun / Pistol]\n6.

Level of support you are willing to provide for the Peshawar Gun Club: [Membership / Voluntary work / Facilitation / References / Funds / Just a vote of support / Regular practice and training / Participation in competitions / None]\n\nMembers from other cities outside KPK, we will need your support as much as people from the province.

(111212, ' AoA Everybody\n\nRotorcrafts came to my place today with his newly acquired bespoke shotgun. guys, I must say though it is Pak made, the shotgun looks and feels extremely impressive. infact, this is probably the most impressively crafted local-made semi auto shotgun I''ve seen and believe me I have seem some serious POS local autoloaders that cost alot more than what Roto payed.\n\nThe gun had everything, light weight, good balance, extremely good finishing, wood to metal fitting, impressive deep blue-black bluing. each and every part clearly showed that the gun is built with special attention to detail as if the manufacturer''s name is on the line (and it was) and he is trying everything he can possibly do to make sure that it (his name and his reputation) doesn''t get hurt.\n\nfrom purely fabrication point of view, the metal work was awesome. it made Baikal shotgun look a like cheap clone. The best part of the shotgun in my opinion was the wood furniture, I was shocked to see the grain on this one. it was oil finished (yes gentlemen, it was not lacquer). it had deep checkering with crisp detail. overall extremely beautiful looking wood.\n\nI''ll let the pictures speak for themselves.\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqhBzvr][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hBzvr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxKxGX0][img]http://s1.postimage.org/KxGX0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsDKTgJ][img]http://s2.postimage.org/DKTgJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV1tgJ0][img]http://s4.postimage.org/1tgJ0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\njust look that zero. the rib to receiver fitting is absolutely zeroed in. I''ve seen some of the expensive imported semi auto shotguns lacking this feature. in case of Baikals, I have yet to see this level of alignment.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqhCBm9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hCBm9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nabsolutely straight rib, all the way upto the front bead. nice wide rib for easier acquisition too.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV1tUDi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/1tUDi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nRegards.\n\np.s. i''m seriously thinking about getting my shotgun''s wood furniture custom made from this guy. after seeing Roto''s shotgun, I believe, its well worth a shot.', ''),

As per law only bag limit is not defined but also the number of hunters for a particular shoot is defined. Going for a partridge shoot with 10 gun (shooters) and 20 beaters is illegal as per law in Punjab for a hunting party on a partridge shoot max. 3 shooters with 10 beaters are allowed beyond this everything is illegal therefore bag above 18 partridges is illegal in any case\n\nAs far as Wild boars are concerned they are âenemy of humanity so kill themâ this is what written on the shooting license.

Regarding the target, you''re measurements suggest that you''re using a standard NRA B-17 target (standard pistol precision/slow fire target for 25/50 m; with each ring being exactly 1 inch apart in radius)? If yes, then it also seems that you print your own targets and take only up to ring no. 5 and not all the way to ring no. 1? If not, then are you using the NRA B-37 target (standard pistol rapid fire target for 25 m), which has more distance between the rings and only goes up to ring no. 5.\n\n2. Your method also prescribes that the point of aim should always be the bull... Well, when I was testing the Baikal, aiming at the 6 o'' clock of the bull just didn''t work at all. I believe this is because the Baikal MP446 is a training and sporting model and therefore has a higher front sight. I was only able to hit the bull or near it when I was aiming at 12 o'' clock of ring no. 5 or 6 of the NRA B-17 target! I experimented this through a much more senior shooter, who came to the same conclusion... Could you please share what you POA was with the Baikal tests...?', ''),

Instead of illegal we should say unlawful hunting.\n\nSecondly i think many members are suggesting to take extreme measures as far as hunting pictures is concerned.

With due respect I would like to disagree with zarar sbs point 1, 3 and 4. Nothing of such kind is promoted by posting pictures.  Point 2 on the other hand should be highlighted after replacing the word negligence with corruption.\n\nIf such suggestions are implemented then the next in the pipeline would be:\n\n1) that you cannot show pics of more than 15 ducks and 10 partridges/quails, as that is the bag limit. \n\n2) send scans of your annual hunting permits to mods.\n\n3) Hold the present day newspaper in your hand to confirm that the animal/bird was not shot in off/breeding season.  This will also confirm that you hunted on Saturday and Sunday only, otherwise it is unlawful.\n\n4)No pictures of houbara bustard (talur), crane, heron, pelican, stork, spoonbill, ibis, flamingo, marbled teal, cotton teal, spotbill duck, common shelduck, ruddy shelduck and woodcock etc.\n\nThe list goes on and on....', ''),

If you point it to them instead of understanding they get offended and take it personally but still this should not stop us in highlighting something that is wrong, as who knows when the message can get across.\n\nI have read in magazine how poachers in USA got nailed after posting their illegal hunting pics on a website very similar to Pakguns.

(111387, ' Although I am not that old and nether have exception hunting experience but deep examinations and analysis thereof is what I used to do therefore after going through discussions on different forums, having conversation with friends and elders and having general gossiping I have concluded that There are different phases in the a hunterâs life.\n\nFirst phase is when one start hunting. In this phase pulling the trigger irrespective of the animal or bird in front is the most desired and enjoyable thing to do.\n\nThen comes the second phase wherein bags of nearby available species of games counts most. In this phase a hunter not only acquire required equipment but also learn different techniques like guns, calibers, cartridges, decoying, calling, blinds etc. just to harvest maximum bag. At the end of this phase a hunter is well aware of different game species, respective hunting spots and various hunting techniques and methodologies.\n\nThen start the third phase. Here a hunter change its hunting priorities like he /she become selective in game species like going for partridges shoot or going only in those areas where he might have more chances for grey partridge or black partridges or going for chukar or see-seeâ¦â¦â¦. Similarly in duck shoot more likes to shoot geese or ruddyshell duck or mallards depends upon a particular hunterâs choice. During this phase a hunter discover new hunting avenues and refine its hunting techniques and equipment according to desired game species at optimal perfection. Till the end of this phase a hunter has fulfilled its maximum desires of huge bags, has also harvested maximum of the available game species and have hunting opportunities at most desired destinations.\n\nDuring the second and third phase a hunter used all means and resources for hunting\n\nThen start the fourth phase where a hunter start talking about conservation, vanishing of game, hunting ethics, rules, regulation, etc. etc. here he / she become more selective and only hunt a few species. In this phase most of the hunters are found preaching Like âI only like to be in the fieldâ I like the company of friends then pulling triggerâ âI only shoot mallardsâ etc. etc. etc. and used to narrate stories of great hunting expeditions with some exaggeration. (Although story telling is a hunterâs particular hobby for life time)\n\nThen comes the fifth phase this phase starts when a hunter become physically week to go in the field. In this phase a hunter more like to talk about hunting than going out in the field\n\nCurrently with this global communication access through internet on different forums most of us are used to start talking about ethics and law in the second and third phase but ultimately practicing ethics starts in the fourth phase because unless and until a hunter has fulfilled its desires of having huge bags and harvesting verity of game species the curiosity usually not let a hunter to practice ethics (Exceptions are always there but donât tell me that everyone here is an exception)\n\nAll members are requested to kindly correct if I am wrong otherwise tell us that in which phase you are ????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nHappy hunting to all', ''),

I agree that hunting without a permit and exceeding bag limits is unlawful and must not be condoned, but as it was mentioned by Kakar saab where will the restrictions end.  another issue not considered by by zarar sahib is what about game that is shot on private reserves or game that is shot overseas?

(111418, ' This is with reference to my last post - Apologies for the bad image - Thats a shooter''s error :). \n\nIn the image, the blue squares represent shots fired with the Baikal using a benchrest, the red circles are shots fired free hand or without a benchrest. The triangles represent shots fired from an old Colt 1911 so that may be disregarded altogether. All shots were fired at 25 meters and the target used was a standard NRA B17 target. \n\nI won''t go into the scoring details as the method used had to be different. But I''ll share some things that I learnt through this test and will share other tests as soon as I can conduct these tests according to Gilani sb''s method at some private range:\n\n1. I realised that even if one does use a benchrest, it still won''t eliminate shooter''s error significantly because as mentioned in some posts above by other members, the grip, trigger squeeze etc. still play an important role; I thought so differently before. This is evident from the minor difference in my scores for benchrest as well as free hand. In fact, I''ve hit a few better shots without using the benchrest.\n\n2. This also means that the benchrest itself has to be prepared with great attention to minor details (as suggested by experts). Normally, one would have to prepare sand bags or other material suiting the shooters comfort. That is more custom work than I imagined.\n\n3. This further implies that either the tests should be conducted by an expert shooter who has immaculate hand control (which is a finding again opposing what I imagined earlier) or through some sort of a machine rest in which the handgun can be fixed.\n\nWith my findings above, I''m not sure how this whole testing business can be made more reliable except that the shooter should be an expert, which is the cheapest solution but in fact a difficult one as we''ll have to wait around for the experts to share their test results... But even in that case, there would be a considerable margin of error and the results might not be considered absolute. By saying this I''m implying that although these tests will definitely give valuable information about a handgun''s accuracy, I don''t think we should do injustice to the guns by ranking them strictly. Any handguns falling in the very accurate/extremely accurate categories should be given preferance. I''m sure the expert shooter will be able to perform well with these handguns...\n\nOpen for comments!\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqjU_b9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/jU_b9.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(111450, ' A proper rest would consist of a sand bag or a cushion, which will enable you to rest your pistol hand or both hands on it. Using a rest will eliminate wavy and shaky movement of hands which we all encounter in off hand shooting. That is it all about.\nPlease note that all other criteria of straight shooting are the same when using a rest, and lacking in any one or more of them would certainly result in inaccurate shots. These are Trigger, Grip, Sight Picture, breath control and consistency.\n\nBenchmarking a firearm is best done on a machine rest. One such product is from well known Ransom U.S. These rests have interchanable grips to accomodate any pitol grip. They are build to let the firearm recoil and do natural muzzle jump. Trigger is operated by a lever which gives a smooth and consistent pull regardless of how many times you fire it. They also have base pads which enables them to adjust lateral or vertical movement of your bore line just like you will do with pistol sights to move your POI. \nA machine rest evens out all criterions which are to be kept for precise shooting and it does it very well. Now it all depends on Barrel, its alignment and lock up. These are the three aspects which finally define accuracy grade of a specific pistol instance. Now all the business comes down to the Barrel quality and precision of grooves and muzzle, Barrel Twist Rate vs. the bullet fired, and lock up of barrel every time the slide cycles. Better firearm makers match the sights of pistol with that of point of impact using machine rests.', ''),

I thought that the benchrest would improve results by eliminating the shooter''s errors significantly, however, as mentioned in my last post and now yours, that isn''t so and a machine rest will in fact be required, which I''ve also mentioned in my earlier posts on this topic. However, a machine rest is hard to come by... and from your last post, you''re basically reaffirming that the tests we are trying to conduct most probably will be influenced significantly by the shooter''s abilities and practice... In which case we are left with the same option that I have proposed earlier as well. Several "good" shooters need to conduct these tests for the same handgun model. That should result in a top five or ten accurate guns - a one step ranking would be misguiding... Out of the top five or ten, it is then up to the shooter to produce the best results in an actual competition or security situation, which depends totally on his/her abilities and practice.\n\nGilani saab, by saying this I in no way mean to shoot down your efforts or method and InshaAllah I intend to continue my support of testing handgun accuracy for the general benefit of the PG members.

Secondary headaches require hospitalization  and extensive imaging to diagnose and most likely brain surgery.\n	 The treatment for primacy headaches- is to abort the headache, It is much easier when the migraine start and become difficult after it takes full swing. Primary can be acute or chronic and with or without aurora. An aura is flashing light, double vision, blind spot and begins 20 30 minutes before the onset of headache and subsides by the beginning of headache. Migrane headache gradually worsen from mild to severe. Migrane is caused among females more than males.  Children gets them too\nFor primary headaches the latest medication are Traptans catagories. Theses are serotonin agonist medications: here are some good migraine medications.   Sumatriptan 6 mg inject sub Q can be repeated in one hour later not to exceed two shots in 24 hours Sumatriptan also available in Nasal spray.\n          Next is Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg to 5 mg  PO not to exceed 10 mg/ 24 hours. \n	Dihydrergtoamine (DHE), a powerful venoconstritor The dose of 1-2 mg  IM usualy terminate migrane hadache.

Its an ongoing process guide people about conservation and convince them that if we did not saved wildlife nothing will left for next generations, we have already ruined the game but its time to wakeup. Slowly people will understand the values of ethical hunting itâs a slow but effective process but we should not left the wildlife at the mercy of poachers. Convince people to avoid netting first, discourage buying wildlife from poachers, discourage partridgeâs chicks purchasing and bhagwa / bulara culture. Promoting C.B.Uâs is also debatable, these are mostly under control of the influential poachers who find better opportunity to devastate the populated areas. Some areas are not illegal but against the spirit of hunting like taking sitters, spotlights, night nesting games, sale purchase of species, wounding out of range birds/wildlife using telescopes and above all killing birds/ wildlife just for fun (Without differentiating Hallal / Harram).

Bans on hunting do nothing more than earn brownie points from bunny huggers. Trapping, poaching, environmental pollution and most importantly loss of habitat are a much bigger threat to hunting.  Banning hunting does nothing but give a free hand to poachers as ethical hunters feel no need to care for species that they cannot utilise, and this then sounds the death knell for any species, affected by such a ban.\n\nNow it remains to be seen how the shikaris of Punjab will react to this unjustified hike in shooting licence fees.', ''),

(111711, ' MKKD brother, thanks for your detailed response. I will make an effort to answer the points raised by you  :)\n\n[quote=MKKD]1. Regarding the target, you''re measurements suggest that you''re using a standard NRA B-17 target (standard pistol precision/slow fire target for 25/50 m; with each ring being exactly 1 inch apart in radius)? If yes, then it also seems that you print your own targets and take only up to ring no. 5 and not all the way to ring no. 1? If not, then are you using the NRA B-37 target (standard pistol rapid fire target for 25 m), which has more distance between the rings and only goes up to ring no. 5.[/quote]\nIn all tests, I have used Standard 25M precision shooting target (B-17). Since my printer can only print up to a limited width, I take out the printouts up to 5 points. However, you would have seen in many places that I have included points less than 5. Those bullets which go a little outside the target but are still up to pt 1, I measure their distance from ring 5 and accordingly award the score.  \n\n[quote=MKKD]2. Your method also prescribes that the point of aim should always be the bull... Well, when I was testing the Baikal, aiming at the 6 o'' clock of the bull just didn''t work at all. I believe this is because the Baikal MP446 is a training and sporting model and therefore has a higher front sight. I was only able to hit the bull or near it when I was aiming at 12 o'' clock of ring no. 5 or 6 of the NRA B-17 target! I experimented this through a much more senior shooter, who came to the same conclusion... Could you please share what you POA was with the Baikal tests...?[/quote]\n[b]In all the tests I have aimed at the same place, ie, center of the bull.[/b] I am not sure about the Baikal that you fired, I have fired three Vikings and all of them were generally hitting in the center, ie, bull. I am strongly of this view (and I have already mentioned it more than once in this thread) that in order to determine the accuracy of the handgun, [b]the shooter must aim in the bull and let the gun fire wherever it does.  No effort should be made to adjust the fire by bringing it towards the bull even if one can clearly see the bullets going away.[/b]Now what is my rationale for this argument? I would like to explain it in some detail here :)\n\n[b]Technically speaking, the accuracy of a gun is indicated by the group that it forms. Smaller the group, more accurate the gun.[/b] However, if a small group is formed away from POA than it means an accurate gun with unadjusted / improperly aligned sites. Practically speaking, this aspect affects the final outcome of a firer effort, ie, his ability to engage a target accurately, hence an important factor to consider for fixed site guns (which most of the guns are). And as I have already mentioned in this thread, [b]it is very difficult for a common person or even a gunsimith to get the fixed sights zeroed.[/b] It is the job of a real expert like Skeeter60 or Dr Gundapur sahib who have spent their lives in this arena. It cant even be done by a good gunsmith unless he is using proper machines (sight mover etc) and has accurate idea of the extent of inaccuracy. Now, most guns from good manufacturers have their sights aligned with guns natural point of impact (the group) hence they produce good results out of the box. This however is not the case with an average manufacturer. [b]So as far as a common person is concerned, he must buy a pistol which fires accurate out of the box because adjustment of fix sights is normally a very difficult exercise.[/b] \n\n[b]During the test therefore, we must aim at the bull and let it fire wherever it does naturally. We would see that if a small group is formed but away from POA than the gun is accurate but not adjusted (which again is serious as I have already explained). If the group is large and also away from POA, the gun is no good and nothing can be done about it. [/b] Adjustment of fire with the purpose of bringing the bullets  close to the bull would, IMHO, defeat the very purpose of carrying out the accuracy test. In this case, it might become a firer''s test / performance whereas it is supposed to remain a handgun''s test :) \n\nAs for the rating in the tests, as you can see half the marks are for group and half are for precision shooting. Ruger Mk III test is a classic example of a accurate but non adjusted gun. But in the end, it came up because it scored very well in the group area. I would say that though the individual result of Ruger surely would have been better had it been properly zeroed, the test achieved what it was supposed to, ie, established Ruger Mk III as an extremely accurate gun. But Ruger had adjustable sights. In fixed sight pistol it cant be done hence my point of buying a gun which is accurate with well adjusted sights, out of the box.   \n\n\n\n\n[quote=MKKD] With my findings above, I''m not sure how this whole testing business can be made more reliable except that the shooter should be an expert, which is the cheapest solution but in fact a difficult one as we''ll have to wait around for the experts to share their test results... But even in that case, there would be a considerable margin of error and the results might not be considered absolute. By saying this I''m implying that although these tests will definitely give valuable information about a handgun''s accuracy, I don''t think we should do injustice to the guns by ranking them strictly. Any handguns falling in the very accurate/extremely accurate categories should be given preferance. I''m sure the expert shooter will be able to perform well with these handguns... [/quote]\nThough you have already read the disclaimer where I clearly wrote that neither these tests are most scientifically conducted tests to determine accuracy nor I am the best firer around, one may argue that if this is not a scientifically conducted accurate test which gives trustworthy results than why is Gilani sahib not only wasting everyone''s time but also his own time and ammo? The reason is that this is a voluntary effort where I have endeavoured to give some kind of tangible idea about the accuracy of a particular handgun which is not at all perfect but is better than nothing(becasue neither I am an expert firer nor I have ideal facilities available for conducting scientific tests) . For example, if a gun scores 68% in a test conducted by me than I am quite positive that if the test is conducted with a machine rest using handload ammo under controlled environment, the result might go to 75% or so but would neither go to 90% nor to 45% in my view. We would therefore have fairly nice idea of the accuracy of a handgun, though not an absolutely accurate one. \n\nAs for posting of results by experts, I absolutely agree with this and have been requesting that since the time I started this thread. It is very important to have diverse results / opinions because that will reduce chances of error / misjudgement. \n\n\n[quote=MKKD]Open for comments!\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqjU_b9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/jU_b9.jpg[/img][/url][/quote]\nI fully appreciate your effort here. However, my request / suggestion for the next test would be that even if the range guys do not allow a test from 10 M, do conduct them from 20 and 30 M. Reason is that with around 25 tests from 10, 20 and 30 M already posted, it has become a standard now. A result from any other distance would not be comparable and would find it difficult to draw the right conclusions. Secondly, please fire a group of 5 bullets only from one distance. With five bullets, one can have a fairly clear idea of MPI (mean point of impact). Firing more bullets may be counter productive. Save this ammo and use it for the second round with the same handgun.\n\nOnce again, thanks for your time and effort :)', ''),

It requires even more skill and practice, usually experience of having checked different guns from this perspective and then also checking their practical shoot out. \n\nI tell you slightly off front sight and rare sight is not an issue, but the real issue is when there is parallax between barrel and sights(which is not the right term here) more like crossing over of line of sights and line of bore.. both these lines ideally must be parallel because they are never perfect. Match pistols make an exception as always are loaded with micro mm adjustable sights. A slightest tinge of parallax between bore and sights will result in shot swaying off with increasing distance. Adjustable slights tend to bring ''em back anyways. This slight parallex is there to some extent always only degree of it varies between handguns and even in hadguns of same model.', ''),

(111780, ' [quote=KageFox]I searched the net, trying to find a proper way to zero fixed sights... only came up with a crude method, outlined in the link below:\n\n[url]http://www.ehow.com/how_5878992_sight_in-gun-fixed-sights.html[/url]\n\nBut how can one, while buying a gun, be assured that a fixed-sight pistol will shoot close to point of aim?[/quote]\n\nYes, this is the method for adjusting the fixed sights manually. Better is to use the sight pusher instead of a hammer. [b]But it is easier said than done and to do it accurately with minimum of strikes is the job of a real expert lest one might end up damaging the sights of the handgun.[/b] And if you have noticed, it is done on the range, not in a workshop (unless workshop has its own firing range). One fires and adjusts. So what we need to understand here is that to do this, one should be an accurate shot and than have the skill to do the mechanical job. \n\nNow how to ensure while buying that a fixed sight pistol shoots close to POA? [b]In fact this aspect has been the very source of motivation to start this thread. [/b]In Pakistan, we hardly have a dealer who would allow testing of the weapon by firing, one therefore cant test fire a weapon while buying. So a dealer would not allow firing of the weapon and even if he somehow allows firing of one weapon he will not allow a customer to test fire say three weapons and select the most accurate out of them. \nOne reasonably workable method is to compile a data base of firing results of different handguns. Through such data, one can draw a picture in his mind that for example hadgun A is in most cases very accurate out of the box whereas handgun B is average and handgun C is generally not very accurate out of the box. Still, there is no guarantee that the specific handgun  that one purchases would comply with the results of the tests, however, one would have a better idea based on some tangible results. :)', ''),

I just missed your post. \nI dont place my hand on the table rather I place my elbows. My hands are free with no support under the hands. I find this method closer to actual off hand shooting while placing of elbows on the table minimises the shaking of the hand. But if you intend using a handrest, it would be better. Just place a sand bad on the table / bench but make sure that your neck and head is at a comfortable angle to shoot. A shooter must not shoot from an awkward position which puts his muscles under undue stress. \nBest of luck for the test, would be eagerly awaiting the results :)[/quote]\n\nThank you sir, as they say, dair aye per durust aye.

The holster fits perfectly, and lies flat against the body but tends to slide on the belt while worn, due to softness of the material used. We figured that if that design were replicated in a harder material like leather, this issue would be solved. Unfortunately, Abba cannot easily make a leather holster due to lack of proper equipment.\n\nWe did try to get a leather version made through dealer friend of his, but the company approached refused... apparently they wanted a larger order than just a single piece.\n\nCan it be done?', ''),

(111802, ' Thank you brother Gilani for the detailed response. \n\nI''ve noted your method for POA and number of shots etc., however, as mentioned earlier, the tests I conducted were not according to your method due to range rules. I''ve also mentioned that I will be conducting these tests again soon inshaAllah at a private range; also that the interpretation of results is clear from the disclaimer... The only thing I was curious about, was the fact that the Viking I was using was hitting around ring no. 4 at 6 o'' clock while my POA was the bull. I must also mention here that this Viking was fresh out of the box. The results were the same when tried by another more experienced shooter. I understand your point about a handgun producing a good grouping, however, we must also note that if a handgun is grouping left or right of the bull, we have a solution for it with a fixed sights handgun; but if its grouping directly below or above the bull, there''s not much that can be done as I don''t know of any method through which the fixed sights can be adjusted for elevation.

(111805, ' Dear members!\n\nPsiFactor and I finally met Dr. Inamullah Gandapur today at his private range to discuss our subject... Thumbs up to PsiFactor for arranging the meeting at such short notice. It was a very pleasant meeting as I found Dr saab extremely welcoming and helpful. Well first off, I am very glad to share with you that we have full support of Dr saab in our endeavour. He has welcomed all [b]responsible[/b] shooters to use his range HOWEVER, we still need to work out some details with him regarding the rules and regulations that will have to be observed at his range. The best incentive for all of us is that we will have the opportunity to learn the art of marksmanship from Dr saab himself! One consideration is that the range is around 30-40 mins drive from Peshawar city. He has also suggested to arrange a meeting of all interested shooters from Peshawar and surrounding areas at his range where we can discuss things at a later stage. We also discussed the option of us (as in the members/shooters) pooling in some money to fund a couple of supervisors at the range (preferably ex-army men who are well acquainted with target shooting); these supervisors will have the responsibility to maintain discipline and range safety regulations etc. I am very confident that this will ultimately lead to part of the solution especially until a full-fleged range/club is established. He also offered his help in contacting the provincial minister of sports Mr. Aqil Shah with regard to establishing a more equipped range in Peshawar city.\n\nWith regard to the FC range, we still intend to meet the IGFC...\n\nBesides this good news, PsiFactor and I had a go at some metal plates with PsiFactor''s CF98 :) so that added a little more spice to the meeting. In fact, that was the start of the meeting! Dr saab took us straight to the shooting point and we had our Bismillah there...\n\nSo here we go guys! after 49 posts I thing we are much closer to our goal than my first post! I''m very happy for all the fellow shooters with this very positive development. Of course this is not the end and we will continue our efforts until we reach a more plausible, practical and permanent solution. The future course of action in a sequential order:\n\n1. I''ll be meeting some other senior PG members tomorrow hopefully to further discuss this topic and get introduced rather informally;\n2. We will be meeting Dr saab again, perhaps more than once, to discuss the exact rules and regulations for using his range until a more permanent solution is reached;\n3. We will arrange a meeting of all Peshawar and surrounding areas PG members and other interested shooters at Dr saab''s range for a detailed breifing inshaAllah\n4. In parallel to the above, we will explore options for the meeting with the IGFC and the provincial minister of sports...\n\nFor now, as requested earlier, please send me your info (see post no. 45 above). This information is cruicial for our objective as it might help A LOT in making our case with the IGFC or the provincial minister of sports for a better range facility. Not to mention, we will need to contact members from time to time to share important information and updates...\n\nPsiFactor: It was a pleasure meeting you in person.
