(609974, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;447787]What u actualy found .32 S&W (short) wow where where? I was gifted a box by someone who had gotten it from a celler in a baluch Sarder''s castle. They were from 1944. (ICI Kynoch: Made in the UK) And I had to use brasso on each and every one. before they would even fit. \n\n\nThey are an absolute joy to shoot. Almost non existent recoil. But In karachi yet to see a dealer who had even heard of them. \n\nIn .32 S&W there were only 2 types available here.32 S&W Long in S&B and Mumtraz brand. A local ammo that barely clears the barrel before falling a couple of feet away. S&W long is around 100 a pop and Mumtaz is 20 a pop[/QUOTE]\n\n.32 short is available at Hira Arms so are the wad cutters in .32 long.\n\nWhat I need was a NIB Arminius or preferably Smith & Wesson in .32 Long but after posting so much on the forum I think nobody is either interested or willing to do a sale of this weapon.\n\nAnyhow on Wednesday, before deadline ( my dealer will sale the ROSSI otherwise ) I will search the market again thoroughly and if the above mentioned brands are not available NIB than I will not waste a minute in purchasing Rossi M69 .32 S&W Long 6 shots 3'' barrel NIB with asking price of 22K. I actually want to purchase this revolver anyways even if S&W is available I will purchase both because licenses are not an issue.\n\nRossi is made up of SS with my dream barrel length of 3 inch. Even in future if I buy Taurus 66 in .357 Magnum I will still go for 3 inch barrel. Finish is beautiful although will need a lot of cleaning due to old grease sticking to revolver.\n\nBut the best part is Grip once I will give a review with plenty of pictures you will realize what I am talking about it is grooved for fingers fits in my hands perfectly well and feels very comfortable and extremely well balanced.\n\nInspite of being a Revolver ( Cylinder issue against CCW ) it is more easy to conceal Rossi than Baikal MP 442 PMM. I will post pictures of both side by side for CC comparision. \n\nNo doubt S&W and or Arminius in .32 Long are better than Rossi, they are no way near to Rossi when the thing comes "purchase the weapon whichever fits your hands well" their grips are not good at all. I know it because I held all these 3 types of weapons with my own hands side by side. Another negative they are in 4 Inch or more which is not my cup of tea.\n\nAt this stage I am confused what to purchase and what not to. Please guide me in regard of Rossi vs S&W vs Arminius ( all in .32 long ) their pros and cons and which one to buy. The day left is only tomorrow so early guidance will be very much appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance & Regards', ''),

I think HP77b/NP22 will be better than Cf98/NP42...\n\nHP77B/NP22 are more durable than CF98/NP42 since earlier were full metal psitol... whereas NP42/CF98 is polymer framed... So in my opinion metal is more solid than polyner, but then this adds a bit weight.. but for HD purposes still NP22/HP77B''s weight is no issue...\n\nPlus NP22 is said to be more accurate than NP22/HP77B... although shooter performs major part in accuracy... however, as per senior nember Gilani Sb'' famous review... NP22 turns out to be more accurate than CF98/NP42...\n\nHowever, may I suggest couple of pistols in 55K ??\n\nWell, before buying do look into Zastava''s EZ9, which is later version of CZ999, a very robust and good pistol (more accurate than NP22/HP77B, CF98/NP42 IMO). Its made in Serbia and will be available in 55K in Peshawar. IMO\n\nP.S. Please share your location, so that members help you accordingly. Thanks', ''),

You have not compared the inside and accuracy. The barrel locking lugs of the CZ specially the rear lug shows complete contact with the counter lug recess on the slide due to complete wear marks.\n If you look at the slide critically it gives out the real story once again. Look at the wear marks. The CZ slide shows a complete slide rail to frame rail contact and wear marks confirming all this, where as on the Canik there are only skimpy wear marks showing only little contact here and there.\nThe CZ slide to frame and barrel to slide fit is truly amazing and can be seen in your pictures.

(610588, 'An interesting  Mugging I decided to go to the friendly neighbourhood mosque today. I parked the car a block away since that was the closest parking place i could find. I saw a motorbike standing at a  distance with a suspicious looking character near the corner of the road that led to the mosque. I stopped and waited for him to leave. He left talking and gesticulating loudly to himself. i figured him out to be a harmless loony and exited the vehicle. As I  was walking down the road i heard the moterbike turning. I was like Oooh Shit.  And tried to walk away from the road. Stupid move really since there was nowhere to go. \n\nHe called Out: kahan Bhaagaay gaa? (Where do u think u can run) He had a point so I stopped trying to inch behind a car.\n\nHim: Paisay day day. (Give me money) \n\nMe: I don''t have my wallet yaar Masjid jaa raaha houn..Talaashi lay lo   (I am going to the mosque search me and see for yourself (By sheer coincidence I actualy had forgotten my wallet at home) \n\nHim: (Quite politely ) Main goli maar doing gaa ( I will shoot you)\n\nAnd to convince me of the seriousness of his threat. he fumbled for some time trying to get his gun out. it was a local darra made 14 shot TT. Absolute Junk..  It was obviously his pride and joy. It was stuck to his side and was all carefully wrapped up in a piece of semi transparent cloth.  \n\n(Apparently, i was supposed to wait till he would take it out.. Open up the parcel. Load the weapon and point and shoot)\n\nHim: There must be money and your wallet in your car. Lets get it. \n\nMe: Why.. would I leave my wallet in the car?\n\nHim:  You must have a mobile\n\nMe: Here take it. \n\nHe opened it and gave me the cover and took out the sim. \n\nMe: Thanks \n\nHim: I wont give u the data card. Unless you have family pics\n\nMe: of course I have family pics..\n\nHim: oh sorry i have a family too. here take it. \n\nThen as an after thought he added: I have a family too.. I really dont want to do this. But there are  (Majburian)  circumstances that I cant control. \n\nI have no idea if he wanted to condole me for robbing me or wanted my forgiveness.. \n\nThe mobile in question was a broken down old Q that I had been lugging around for purely sentimental value.  When i had gone to buy a smart phone i was offered around Rs. 100 for it.  The smartphone was in my pocket. Which he never checked. Nor did he try to divest me of my watch. Nice of him really.\n\nHim: Are you sure you don''t have any money on your car? He asked me hopefully. \n\nNo i am afraid i don''t i said trying to look as regretful as possible. \n\nHim: maaf karna bhai ( forgive me brother) And actually shook hands with me and left.  (If not for the gift wrapped TT i might have embraced him with brotherly love and affection)\n\nLater at the gate of the mosque a heroic-young-man asked me to hop on his bike so that we could  go and catch him. I was like umm err Ok. I made the heroic-young-man stop near my car to retrieve my pepper spray. I figured me and the heroic-young-man evened the odds a bit with the pepper spray against  the gift wrapped TT toting  thug. We tried but could not find the dude and I was relieved. A pepper spray is not much of an offensive weapon against a TT. And as for the heroic-young-man I had no idea what heroism he had in mind if we would have actually found the dude.  Since he was so excited i thought it rude to ask him. \n\nTail peice.: When i got home and told my mom the whole story she was like do u know how diificult it is to run a house. maybe he had little starvbing kids a sister desperate to get married. And u gave him a sau rupay kaa phone!!  ( A rs. 100 rupee phone) \n\nI was like i am sorry i really did not have my wallet with me. i don''t think she believes me. :(', ''),

I would request DSA to provide some different styles of after market grips.\nAll the rounds were fired smoothly but one FT-fire caused, the reason was the same i think DR.Gillani faced, & it fired that round right after tapping the magazine.\nOverall i think its the best choice in its price range, I am already in love with her, will share every AAR Insh-Allah.\nPics.\nTrigger guard is made large so fingers can get-in-out easily & can easily get behind the trigger when needed, the mag capacity, as well all know is 14+1.\n[IMG][URL="http://s102.photobucket.com/user/legionlad/media/DSA-Trushot_zps96c91071.png.html"][IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m88/legionlad/DSA-Trushot_zps96c91071.png[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\nThe lock is ambidextrous, I don''t have any info about the barrel, if DSA can help me out here.\n[IMG][URL="http://s102.photobucket.com/user/legionlad/media/mm_zps96bcecac.png.html"][IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m88/legionlad/mm_zps96bcecac.png[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]', ''),

But for those in the know their Mistral 3 that&#8217;s been around for quite a few years is a nice little tool. So much so that after testing I&#8217;d say if you&#8217;re looking for a good self-loader then this gun is worth serious consideration.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=arial]. [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=arial][B]More than a feeling[/B][/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=arial]Subtly stamped with the word FAP or F.LLI PIETTA, the appearance and finish of the Mistral 3 is probably more than you&#8217;d expect when compared to the price you&#8217;ve just paid. Equally once assembled, the gun&#8217;s 7lbs 2oz weight confirms that you do at least have a decent piece of kit in your hands.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=arial]Barrel wise, a small brass bead crowns off the slightly flared muzzle that&#8217;s designed to accept the three, flush fitting chromed multi-chokes (supplied) of Full, Modified and Cylinder restrictions. The 28&#8221;, chrome-lined, steel-proofed tube shows a constant cross &#8211; cut 7mm vented rib. What is interesting is that only a short extension and a small lug to the rear of the 3&#8221; chamber is required to locate and secure the barrel. The receiver is ERGAL (aircraft grade aluminium) with a black, anodised coating. The twin-lug bolt is chromed so contrasts nicely in terms of looks. This is finished off with a gold-plated trigger blade, white script Mistral and red diamond FAP logo.The mechanism is very much your standard gas/piston layout, with gas being tapped off the barrel and directed on to a sliding piston to cycle the action. Pietta have modified certain areas to their own requirements. The recoil spring that sits over the magazine tube is slightly longer than usual indicating an extended travel during recycling. Pietta remains singularly tight lipped regarding the action and its workings. Although these differences are visually marginal, they do make a significant improvement in use.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#666666][FONT=arial]Loading is standard; open the action and drop the first shell in through the ejection port, then press the bolt release located on the left of the action. The remaining rounds are simply pushed in to the magazine from the bottom. I have to say the design of the shell lifter did seem rather rudimentary in its construction when compared to the rest of the gun. The safety is a cross bolt plunger at the rear of the trigger guard, with the overly small bolt lock catch forward of it on the left.n many ways shooting the Mistral 3 sets your mind at odds. Here we have a traditional looking semi-auto with few frills; so no recoil inserts, cushions or any gizmos found on the bigger names in this area. However, apart from a noticeable &#8216;clack&#8217; when up and running, whether it was 28gram Supremes all the way up to 50gram Max Game, the Mistral 3 cycled the lot whilst dialling out truly impressive amounts of recoil Fitted with nothing more than ¼ choke, a round of Rishton SG&#8217;s sporting once again confirmed what a genuinely nice gun the Pietta is. Straight out of the box I fired two shots on the first stand to ensure the Mistral 3 actually worked. Then followed it up with a mid-forties score that was more than acceptable. The gun is genuinely nice; being light, efficient, well balanced and capable of throwing a good even pattern, all in all doing exactly what is asked of it. I have purchased it and found it very best realy [/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(611012, ' Why I love my Norinco AR... At one point, I had along with my CQ, a standard LMT, and a Daniel Defense V7. When I grew out of my AR obsession, it was an easy decision which ones to sell. The one rifle I honestly couldn''t let go of was the Norinco. The others were not accessorized but that had nothing to do with it. The DD already came with the front hand guard and Magpul stock, yet at twice the price, it''s quality was on par with the Norc. The LMT at thrice the price, looked just like the Norinco originally did from the factory, standard AR 15. It indeed had better fit and finish (although not 3x better), yet accuracy and reliability - wise, I noticed no significant advantage... or any advantage. One reason I didn''t enjoy those two rifles as much was because I found myself babying them all the time due to their cost. But regardless of that, when you spend X amount of money, one has certain expectations. In that regard, the more expensive rifles left me wanting. Because they cost extra, I was always looking for that extra something (which wasn''t there... or at least I couldn''t see it). But with the CQ,  even the original gun went way beyond my expectations. All in all, I ended up spending about as much on it as the DD, but in this case, I can see and feel exactly where all the extras are... and that is why I love my Norinco AR!', ''),

The day he gets the ammo through, I''ll be picking up a few many rounds at committed price of 27rs a pop.\n\nYou are correct that Karachi dealers have a stockpile as another Punjab based dealer I know sold all his Norinco shipment to a dealer in Karachi as he couldn''t get the clearance after trying for so many months. Good time for Karachi dealers as everything is routed via them one way or another so they are making a killing (per se).\n\nIt''s tricky but not thaaat difficult to move a few pistols from Karachi to other cities, such has been the case with these PX3''s, but moving a good few thousand bullets is more tricky and not many dealers can afford to have a large Chinese stock of theirs confiscated enroute. Punjab is getting hit hard with the you-can''t-have-weapons-only-we-can provincial government imposing new rules with increased frequency of raids as well.', ''),

You are confusing instincts with reflex actions. There might be a connection between the two at some stage and level but they are by no means the same thing. Instincts have a lot to do with you genetically (not entirely). \nAs far as your trigger discipline is concerned, well, placing the finger behind the trigger may make you feel safe but trust me, you do not want to develop it as a habit as it will ultimately lead you to to develop muscle memory that would involve placing your finger inside the trigger guard but not on the trigger. The finger should go into the trigger guard only to shoot, and I don''t think anyone would want to have any sort of confusion as to what one is doing with one''s finger when it goes into the trigger guard. Even the best trained tactical handgun shooters do not place their finger inside the trigger guard. \nNo matter how well trained you are, how strong you control your instincts (which, by the way, could be improved a wee bit but cannot be controlled because a lot of genetics is involved), I strongly advise you not to place your finger inside the trigger guard even behind the trigger. You will lose a precious second in an impromptu gunfight pulling it out and placing/adjusting it on the trigger itself after again losing a second in re-acquiring your target. Two seconds can change the game, all because of the action movie flick style finger in the trigger guard. The only exception being if you are a sniper and are not prone to clenching your fingers as a result of human reflex action in case you are kicking, jumping or trying to stay balanced while falling. A sniper has to stay very still so he is not prone to clenching fingers.\nAnd L-Lad, if you trust your instincts, do not attempt to control them else you will find yourself in a very bad spot.

(611194, ' [QUOTE=Glock17;449047]Lad, hate to break this on you but you are way off course from your waypoints. You are confusing instincts with reflex actions. There might be a connection between the two at some stage and level but they are by no means the same thing. Instincts have a lot to do with you genetically (not entirely). \nAs far as your trigger discipline is concerned, well, placing the finger behind the trigger may make you feel safe but trust me, you do not want to develop it as a habit as it will ultimately lead you to to develop muscle memory that would involve placing your finger inside the trigger guard but not on the trigger. The finger should go into the trigger guard only to shoot, and I don''t think anyone would want to have any sort of confusion as to what one is doing with one''s finger when it goes into the trigger guard. Even the best trained tactical handgun shooters do not place their finger inside the trigger guard. \nNo matter how well trained you are, how strong you control your instincts (which, by the way, could be improved a wee bit but cannot be controlled because a lot of genetics is involved), I strongly advise you not to place your finger inside the trigger guard even behind the trigger. You will lose a precious second in an impromptu gunfight pulling it out and placing/adjusting it on the trigger itself after again losing a second in re-acquiring your target. Two seconds can change the game, all because of the action movie flick style finger in the trigger guard. The only exception being if you are a sniper and are not prone to clenching your fingers as a result of human reflex action in case you are kicking, jumping or trying to stay balanced while falling. A sniper has to stay very still so he is not prone to clenching fingers.\nAnd L-Lad, if you trust your instincts, do not attempt to control them else you will find yourself in a very bad spot. Improve them.[/QUOTE]\n\nI already explained that one is natural & 2nd is mixed with learned behavior which can be improved, some instincts do contain a collection of reflexes.\nI don''t know if it is compulsory to follow the best tactical shooters because everyone has his own safety rules, with an assault full auto keeping finger on the frame can easily slide into the trigger guard while clearing a jam or at condition 1.', ''),

We salute your photography skills, the pictures in your review are certainly of a very high quality. \r\n\r\nPlease email us your questions regarding the barrel and we will respond accordingly. \r\n\r\nWe have been working at the grips since the 1st PG member review done by Dr. GILANI and friends. This will take sometime as new tooling has to be produced and made to satisfactory standards. I.A. we hope to provide enthusiasts with more options in near future however for the time being the current grip shall be seen on production DSA Trushots.\r\n\r\nKindly also note that the DSA scratchless coating is only available on the Aluminum frame and external surface of the Barrel.

I would request DSA to provide some different styles of after market grips.\r\nAll the rounds were fired smoothly but one FT-fire caused, the reason was the same i think DR.Gillani faced, & it fired that round right after tapping the magazine.\r\nOverall i think its the best choice in its price range, I am already in love with her, will share every AAR Insh-Allah.\r\nPics.\r\nTrigger guard is made large so fingers can get-in-out easily & can easily get behind the trigger when needed, the mag capacity, as well all know is 14+1.\r\n[IMG][URL="http://s102.photobucket.com/user/legionlad/media/DSA-Trushot_zps96c91071.png.html"][IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m88/legionlad/DSA-Trushot_zps96c91071.png[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\r\nThe lock is ambidextrous, I don''t have any info about the barrel, if DSA can help me out here.\r\n[IMG][URL="http://s102.photobucket.com/user/legionlad/media/mm_zps96bcecac.png.html"][IMG]http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m88/legionlad/mm_zps96bcecac.png[/IMG][/URL][/IMG][/QUOTE]', ''),

The fibre optic. well I saw the fibre. But there really was no optic. it was small transparent tube with zero colour. i think it faded away over time.  and the ones in the back had been recoloured  as well. \n\nOut of 2 peices One had its safety lock broken on the left side. Some one flicked it and well... it flicked right off!!!  Extra mags were not interchangeable. Extra true shot mags that is.. \n\nEven my Rac PT 92 could use extra mags. The True shot did not. not that piece anyway.  \n\n\nThe one I saw did not have a firing pin safety.  \n\nThen there was this issue it had with the disessmbly lever. Unlike the CF 98 or the PT 92 or just bout all pistols. U have to push a button or pin on one side and then open the latch and sometimes U have to align the slide to a certain point to commence desaambly. Not so with the DSA trueshot. All u have to do is flick the disassembly lever from a horizontal to the vertical position and pfft. the thing was fall apart. Its a pretty light lever at that. \n\nNow I tend to shoot with the index finger on the frame. Imagine a practical shooting competition and I rest my finger on the lever. I push it downwards accidentally and the whole thing will simply fall apart! \n\nThe mags have no cutouts. cant know how many bullets there are in the mag. \n\nThe Feed ramp is too steep. I was told that the particular weapon i was handling had issues with hollow points. \n\nBut the worst thing in the weapon from the safety point of view is its safety lever.. When its not flying off the gun that is. \n\nThe one I handled made a nice resounding click when I flicked it on. And it was cocked and locked right?\nWRONG! The darned thing dropped the hammer on the firing  pin!!!!! \n\n[I][B]You have to push the lever beyond its clicking point! [/B][/I]Otherwise the weapon is to all extents and  cocked and unlocked. That may seem like a small thing. But almost all of us who handle fire arms are conditioned to treat our weapons as locked when the safety latch can be heard! \n\nPlease notice that I am comparing the weapon to the RAC PT 92 here. Not any imported one. I am extremely sorry for these findings. i had hopes.. High apple in the pie hopes for the DSA Trueshot brand.  Its our own design made by my very own community. \n\nBy contrast the only issue I ever faced with my RAC PT 92 was that its back sight was loose.

In other areas the TT-33 differs more from Browning''s designs — it employs a much simpler hammer/[URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sear_(firearm)"]sear[/URL] assembly than the M1911, with an external hammer. This assembly is removable from the weapon as a modular unit and includes cartridge guides that provide reliable functioning. The Soviet engineers also added several other features such as locking lugs all around the barrel (not just on top), and made several alterations to make the mechanism easier to produce and maintain, notably a captive recoil spring secured to the guide rod which does not depend on the barrel bushing to hold it under tension.

Please step forward:  Evaluation of IDP’s situation  Our Appeal: 500,000 citizens of Pakistan from North Waziristan (NWA) are homeless today. Families don’t have a roof, children don’t have schools to go to, men and women are unable to provide for their families. There are several types of skin and stomach diseases, caused by heat, lack of sanitation and other crises induced factors. Aid is lacking and should be reinforced in the following areas: 1. Clean drinking water. 2. Hygiene products for women and children. 3. Clean clothes. 4. Rehydrating and energizing sachets/liquids. 5. Medical supplies for humans especially for skin and stomach diseases. 6. Fodder and medicines for live stock. 7. Volunteers to lend a hand in speeding the effort as well as emotional support to the people in need.  We are collecting funds to be able to assist in the current situation. If we are able to generate funds nearing 1 million PKR we plan to assist in terms of medicines for humans and fodder for animals. If we are able to generate the proper momentum and touch marks of 5 million and over we plan to open a fully functional medical camp which provides free assistance to people and invest in areas of sanitation (portable toilets etc). We have been a part of relief efforts in the past. However our appeal is that pick anyone you trust but do join the larger effort of helping the people of NWA. A small gesture, a small sacrifice like:  1. Encouraging your children to donate their pocket money/ Eidi/ video game money. (Teach them the virtue of selfless deeds) 2. Donating a day’s salary. (we know we can manage it) 3. Deciding not to indulge in extravagant ‘iftars’ this Ramadan or at least, reducing the number. (There will be a Ramadan next year too InshaAllah but these people might not be) 4. Volunteering for a couple of days (we need people on ground to help speed things up and to make them feel that we care) 5. Foregoing something of your own (even the smallest of things like a cup of tea/ coffee) and donating that money to commit yourself to the cause emotionally. 6. Spreading the message around, asking people to contribute.  And many more like these, are the ways to turn the fate of our brothers and sisters from North Waziristan, by dictates of religion and citizenship, the plight of the people of Waziristan is our plight. Their suffering and struggle requires our support and assistance. Our vision is to generate a momentum in the Pakistani society to stand with the people of North Waziristan to a point where every Pakistani is emotionally connected to the cause and feels committed to the rehabilitation of NWA and its people into the mainstream society. Detailed report of our visit to Bannu and analysis of the IDP situation: In Bannu we met with children who went to schools, boys who like to play football, men who had shops and businesses. I didn’t come across a single terrorist. Please make sure that our ignorance doesn’t turn them into one. Their sacrifice should not go to waste, please choose to take responsibility of these people. Do not submit their future to darkness. The Journey: Aanis and I left for Bannu to visit the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) on Saturday, June 28, 2014. We left early morning and were in Bannu at around 9:30am. The terrain changes gradually from green to dry and the temperature had reached approximately 40 degrees by the time we were crossing Lachi (approximately 100 km from Bannu). Near Karak (40 min from Bannu), the environment in the car was visibly tense. All the talk about terrorists and extremists was at play, each one seemed to be expecting the worst. Along the way, we stopped at a deserted petrol pump, a police check post and then in the middle of the crowded Bannu bazar to ask for directions. Everyone was very friendly and true to their Pakhtoon traditions, offered us tea or food. The Method: The FDMA (Fata Disaster Management Authority) registers people at two exit points from the operational area,. The FDMA issues a card each to all Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), which is then verified by NADRA (National Database and Registration Authority). This card acts as a record for all the cash and food items disbursed to these IDPs from different Distribution Points (DPs). The Setup: We visited two of the three major Distribution Points in Bannu. The first one was the main Bannu stadium, that acts as the largest and most crowded Distribution Point for the IDPs. Outside the stadium, there were smaller distribution stalls, set up by individuals and private parties. Inside the stadium there were: 1. Cash distribution setups 2. Food and necessity distribution setups 3. Medical camps A similar setup was seen at the 2nd Distribution Point, set up in Mamash khel on the Bannu-Miran Shah road (refer to DP3 in figure below). Arrangements for shade and clean drinking water were made outside both the Distribution Points . Priority was being given to elders, widows and the sick. The Situation: It was the third day since the start of the IDP relief efforts, the temperatures had gone up to 44 degrees centigrade. People had to wait for hours for their turns to come (lack of volunteers), however majority of them were satisfied with the quality of food and the distribution system at the Distribution Points. Average family size was reported to be 14 people. Overall, people seemed satisfied with the quality as well as the quantity of food being distributed. Unlike Swat, the weather in Bannu is hot and humid and the terrain is dry. As per the Government records almost 500,000 have exited the operational area. As livestock is the main source of their livelihood, majority of them have brought along herds of animals and livestock. There is a dearth of livestock fodder and medical assistance. Hence, these are desperately needed by the IDPs in Bannu. Skin and stomach diseases are rampant among the IDPs and likely to grow, keeping in view the weather and the over crowded conditions of the city. Hence, medicines, especially those treating loose motions and skin rashes are in high demand. Although current stocks seem to be working, more is required. A list of medicines is being chalked out with the help of some local doctors and will be floated on the page. Please come forward and play your role.  Waqqas Khanzada', ''),

But there really was no optic. it was small transparent tube with zero colour. i think it faded away over time.  and the ones in the back had been recoloured  as well. \nThe weapon in question was the property of Elahi Bux and co.[/QUOTE]\n\nDear ED\nFrom what I read here, I guess this particular unit was the lemonest-of-them-all. lol. Stay assured that during testing the Trushot for the first time and almost half a dozen times after that (when we visited DSA for sharing our feedback with their administration regarding TRUSHOT) we came across several of their newly produced handguns and none of them had the issues you pointed out. Thats why I am absolutely clueless as to what has reached Elahi Bux and Co in Karachi. \nDr Gilani''s handgun and then few others which we tested, the magazines were interchangeable (we were provided with 6 magazines for testing Dr Gilani''s handgun and they all worked fine); the optics in the rear and front sights were quite clear; (pictured below), the dis-assembly lever was operable (movable) only if the notch in the slide was aligned with the rotary design of the lever and last but not the least the safety lever was also functioning properly. The only conclusion I can make from your experience is that the one you came across was a lemon and should not be on the shelf of a dealer. Why did that particular piece reach a dealer''s shelf (in that condition) is a valid question which DSA needs to look in to. \n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/IMG_0613_zpsacfd51ae.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Trushot 9x19/IMG_0613_zpsacfd51ae.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nAs far as the peep-holes :) in the magazines are concerned, yes among few other things, that was also communicated to DSA and it should be done. \nThe interesting thing about feeding ramp is that on our first test, we shot more than 350 rounds (FMJs) and we didn''t see any FT-Feed. Hollow-points were not tested so cant comment. However, some observations state that some times the feeding of a JHP may occur in a certain unit of a particular model and at the same may NOT occur in another unit of the same model/brand. So other than being a physical dimensional related question, I guess its quite dependent upon the material composition of the feeding ramp as well as its level of surface polish. InshAllah, on our next visit to the range, we shall check out the performance of the JHP on Trushot''s feeding ramp.', ''),

(611629, 'Bladetech Holsters in Pakistan! OK, so I finally got hold of a set of BladeTech Tactical Holster and Mag carrier for my CZ-75B!\n\nHad been looking for the right thing for months now and had only seen an original Fobus at a Zamzama shop for Rs.3,500 but the [I]Made in Israel[/I] tag kind of put me off it.\n\nI  had given up hope and was deciding to either make a Kydex holster  myself or resign to those Saddler type nylon ones when I heard that the "Shooting-Association-whose-name-cannot-be-mentioned" had gotten the sole dealership of Bladetechs in  Pakistan!\n\nI went to the Bladetech website and was pretty impressed and  decided to get one. When I heard the price (Rs.11,000) for a set of  holster and magazine pouch(?) I was a bit depressed, that''s a lot of  money to pay for a holster even though they are charging almost the same  price as the website!\n\nSo I drove out thinking that  I''ll just check it out and then go to Saddar looking for 2,000-3,000  wala holsters. Afterall, they''re all kydex and what difference would it  make if it''s a Bladetech or a China Fobus?\n\nOnce I saw the  workmanship, yes i was impressed by the smooth and tight molding and  sturdy feel but still not impressed enough to cough up 11K. And then the  moment of truth came when I slid in my gun... damn, it fit like a  ******** ! (Ofcourse these holsters are custom made for specific brands and  models).\n\nI wore the holster on my belt and tried it out by  drawing and putting my gun back in and believe me, I understood why the  USD 100+ holsters are so costly; they are made with artistic precision!\n\nseating  the gun all the way in, it slides in with little effort and a click can  be felt and heard when it is fixed even though there is no lock or  button.\n\ndrawing too is a breeze, however any new holster requires a lot of dry practice to get the hang of it.\n\nThe  TekLok technology basically ensures that unlike a paddle or  conventional belt clips, this clip can be adjusted according to the  width of the belt and has a second "lock" lever like the kind of double  clasp you would find in a good wristwatch''s steel strap to maximize a  secure fit and eliminate accidental dropping or loosening.\n\nFurthermore,  there is a screw on both the holster and the mag pouch which can be  turned to adjust the tightness with which your gun or mags should be  held in place.\n\nI''m glad "they" have become the sole  distributor of Bladetech Holsters and despite the fact that I cannot  understand how they can keep the prices level with the actual company  rates, I just hope it stays that way and they bring in more accessories  in the future. I am proud to have gotten a product from their first  shipment.\n\nWhether you are a Law-man or a sportsman, whether you  carry openly on the uniform or for practical shooting sports, these are  the best holsters you can have.\n\nCan''t wait to hit the range ;)\n\nP.S. If you want to check them out, drop in at Elahee Buksh & Co at Clifton, Khi and see for yourself. \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]31418[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31419[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31420[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31421[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31422[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31423[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31424[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31425[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31426[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31427[/ATTACH]', ''),

(611666, ' [QUOTE=Jibz;449469]Dear ED\nFrom what I read here, I guess this particular unit was the lemonest-of-them-all. lol. Stay assured that during testing the Trushot for the first time and almost half a dozen times after that (when we visited DSA for sharing our feedback with their administration regarding TRUSHOT) we came across several of their newly produced handguns and none of them had the issues you pointed out. Thats why I am absolutely clueless as to what has reached Elahi Bux and Co in Karachi. \nDr Gilani''s handgun and then few others which we tested, the magazines were interchangeable (we were provided with 6 magazines for testing Dr Gilani''s handgun and they all worked fine); the optics in the rear and front sights were quite clear; (pictured below), the dis-assembly lever was operable (movable) only if the notch in the slide was aligned with the rotary design of the lever and last but not the least the safety lever was also functioning properly. The only conclusion I can make from your experience is that the one you came across was a lemon and should not be on the shelf of a dealer. Why did that particular piece reach a dealer''s shelf (in that condition) is a valid question which DSA needs to look in to. \n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Trushot 9x19/IMG_0613_zpsacfd51ae.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Trushot 9x19/IMG_0613_zpsacfd51ae.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nAs far as the peep-holes :) in the magazines are concerned, yes among few other things, that was also communicated to DSA and it should be done. \nThe interesting thing about feeding ramp is that on our first test, we shot more than 350 rounds (FMJs) and we didn''t see any FT-Feed. Hollow-points were not tested so cant comment. However, some observations state that some times the feeding of a JHP may occur in a certain unit of a particular model and at the same may NOT occur in another unit of the same model/brand. So other than being a physical dimensional related question, I guess its quite dependent upon the material composition of the feeding ramp as well as its level of surface polish. InshAllah, on our next visit to the range, we shall check out the performance of the JHP on Trushot''s feeding ramp.[/QUOTE]\nGood ans jibz.....', ''),

(611691, 'Range Review Approached LRC at about 10:00 AM and as expected range was all empty due to Ramzan Mubarak & today it was hot.\n\nAny way it was good for me as I can do things more comfortably while alone. Brought two weapons to the range\n\n1. Baikal MP 161 K 0.22 LR Semiauto Rifle\n2. Rossi M 89 .32 Long S&W 6 Shot Revolver ( The Revolver under discussion )\n\nFirst I planned to do some shooting with Revolver, previously I have just fired Revolver only once at LRC and it was Taurus .357 Magnum giving me hell of a jerk and was never able to even hit the target at all, all were flyers. So, I was a bit concerned. Here is the view at range\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]31430[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31433[/ATTACH]\n\nTargets were set at 15 & 25 yards. First I tried at 15 yards. As I mentioned earlier grip was very comfortable and as a result weapon was very well balanced. Front site was good enough. Fired six shots in SA mode, triger was feather light and here are the results\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]31431[/ATTACH]\n\nBetter than my expectation and recoil was almost nothing compared to 9mm. In my opinion a very good personal defense weapon even for ladies who are afraid of recoil. Noise was also low. If you can please appreciate the shot at No.6 ( there is only one shot at No. 6 ) at 5 o''clock position ..... that is of wad cutter on close inspection I realized it is different from others as it has very sharp cut edges making it easier for counting scores in competitions. Only then I realized why Jeff Cooper said .38 wad cutter is the best for competition / target shooting.\n\nThen I aimed at 25 yard target with following results\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]31432[/ATTACH]\n\nOnly six shots were fired due to lack of ammo and as it is quite visible 5 out of six shots landed in the black and the one which missed the black, it only missed by an inch or so. Shooting at 25 yards was more accurate than at 15 perhaps I gained a little experience by firing a few shots or firearm is zeroed at 25 yards.\n\nIn experienced hands the one who are more used to shooting revolvers I am sure results would be even more better.\n\nThis bring me to the end of review. I am extremely happy and thrilled by having this weapon and it outperformed my expectations really turned out to be a Gem at 25 K, an excellent weapon at very low price.', ''),

On the day Dr Gillani''s pistol was being tested at their facility Nazim Sb pointed out to the management that the trigger guard should have serrations as some shooters place their fingers on the trigger guard. After a couple of weeks later we visited their factory again and were shown a frame to check if the serrations were ok. Nazim Sb this time pointed out that the serrations are to wide and don''t add up with the aesthetics. After saying this we went to their range to test one of our purchases, while we were at it a new frame with closer serrations was presented before to seek our suggestions. This time to DSA''s good luck Nazim sb appreciated the serrations :P . This is just one example im stating here, Jibz would substantiate their keenness to address the weaknesses as pointed out by us. But I would request the members to continue the positive criticism but at the same I would request everyone to let them sell a few pieces and don''t disheart the DSA team by too much criticism otherwise this long awaited project may come to an end. So far only 2 pieces of the gun have been purchased by PG members, the first by Dr Gillani and the 2nd by Legion lad. Dr Gillani who by any standard is not a newbie and is quite an expert, if he is happy with his gun after firing over 400 rounds by now then i must say that this gun is not a lemon.

(611792, ' Respected Gentlemen, \n\nThank you for your comments, critiques, concerns and also uplifting support. All wonderful and expected segments of a community! \n\nAs mentioned several times before, the struggle for improvement never ends UNLESS a company is not interested in what it does. We can assure you that we are not such a company who doesn''t care for what it has to offer and its customers. Technical challenges always persist with new designs and with persistence they can be resolved. Some sooner than others. All your points have been given due attention and will be reflected into further productions as the product becomes more mature. You support for a Pakistani product is vital for it reaching the goals you expect from it too. We are very product of the PG members who despite of the Trushot being a newly released product, have kept their faith and confidence in our capabilities and determination to be indigenous in order to make a name for our country. \n\nMr. ED Thank you for sharing your thoughts. You are right, that unit was only meant for Mr. Hamza Zahid khan who works with Ilahi Bux co. to review it and pass on his feedback. It was one of the early productions and was rushed to Karachi carried on a personal All-Pakistan license upon multiple requests from Mr. H.Z. Khan. This was an internal production piece transferred to Mr H.Z. Khan and is/was not meant to be sold to anyone or being displayed on Shop shelves. Ilahi Bux co. also has no authorized dealer agreement with DSA at moment either. \n\nWe are grateful to Mr. H.Z.khan for the time he put in order to review this initial production piece belonging to a very small batch product for the purposes of getting initial responses from Dealers and professional shooters. Mr. H.Z. Khan''s feedback was implemented right away. This is the reason Mr. Jibz and Fraz, Dr. Gilani and Mr. Legion Lad did not have similar concerns. So Mr. ED if that piece was presented to you as for sale or as what the current Trushot is, then you have been misled. Please also note that piece you saw may have been taken apart during reviews and not put back together fully. We hope you will give it a second chance and try it out for yourself. \n\nThe trigger guard was justified previously as well. The Design of the guard is here to stay and a major reason is that the Trushot maybe considered by Law Enforcement agencies that require their personnel to wear combat gloves. When wearing gloves, the dexterity is greatly enhanced while in handguns with smaller trigger guards the fit is very tight and uncomfortable.  This was our major design criteria for a different style of trigger guard. The serrations have been added as per suggestions received from PG members. \n\nThe Forward trigger was decided after several iterations of trigger designs. In fact adjusting the trigger to its current position was a matter which delayed production by several months. With the trigger resting backwards, the trigger pull and creep were grateful affected and required a much tighter squeeze to make the action work. Over long period of time the would create fatigue in the shooters finger and palm. The new trigger position may be a little forward however, in reality it is much more ergonomic and easier to use compared to previous revisions. This by no means that every shooter would agree, every person has their own preference and their own size of hand and level of strength. This is why many people, specially competition shooters will spend a lot of time and money in further customizing their pistols to meet their personal needs. \n\nSome people were very concerned about a picture floated earlier having a foregrip. Please rest assure for those who don''t know it wasn''t a permanent feature of the gun,  such a foregrip attachment that can easily fit onto the front rail. Some people may like it for looks, some may actually use it and others may hate it. Isn''t that the case with pretty much everything? Once again the DSA Trushot is only a affordable and reliable platform with DSA physically present in Pakistan for after sales service. There are no limits of the amount of accessorization, enhancements and modifications you can do. All that is only limited by the person''s imagination, skills and budget.  The Trushot does offer a decent platform for this. \n\nAs mentioned a few times before, work has started on grips and sights as well. All these little things also take up time but we are consistently pushing the design forward. \n\nThere as mention by someone about our Auto Loader guns. We would like to acknowledge the comment made and also mention that the Auto-Loader was given a lot of time and attention however, it was taken off the production line due to persistent problems which were not acceptable to us or our customers. We supported our customers who came back to us in every way possible to resolve issues. Eventually even after several revisions and changes, the issues couldn''t be resolved to our required standards and product was discontinued completely. It was our responsibility to shut down the Auto-loader project and we did so. We will do the same for any other product if, GOD FORBID, it is needed. In fact any responsible company would do so!\n\nA slight change of Topic. While  some Pakistani''s skeptical of the DSA Trushot, we are Thankful to Allah and are proud to share the following excerpts from BATF USA. The TRUSHOT has passed the strict BATFE inspections and received a high score of 90 and is deemed fit for import to the USA. \n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]31447[/ATTACH]\n\nSincerely,\n\nDSA\n\n\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=Glock17;449424]The trigger guard is unnecessarily large specially under the trigger itself. Rest is okay. The trigger is way too forward in the guard. Bringing it back will also help in overcoming the chunky grip issue to an extent.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Or some other aspect?\r\n\r\nI rate Zastava M57 over others due to longer grip which gives me more control. In case of other TTs, the grip is short. I was never accurate with any TT till I shot with Zastava.\r\n\r\nAs far as reliability is concerned, I have never faced any problem with any foreign made TT. All shot very fine.\r\n\r\nAround 15 years ago, we had a Chinese TT which was gifted to us with half sack (that 50 Kgs fertilizer polypropylene bag) of mixed ammo (russian surplus sort of rusted, Chinese and Dara refilled). That TT shot every kind of ammo without any hick up.

Went to few factories making replicas and tt.  one shop had few locals and the guy was like this gun is used by rambo fired this much that much great gun, i looked in the barrel and found a lump. i told him theres a lump in the barrell its not safe, shop owner told me its rust and will be gone after few rounds. long story short, my uncle, their contect and shop owner all agreed that this is the piece. so we went to try it, put a cheapest round in it and gave it to me, i aimed at a tree and when i pulled the trigger, it made fire like that old guns and i closed my eyes, all the gun power came back on my face and the bullet also got stuck in barrell. Allah saved my eyes only forehead burns. shop owner insisted to take me to the doctor, he was very embarrassed. Any way they did buy from another shop, Indian made, this time i didnt fire it.[/QUOTE]\nBro you got lucky that you didn''t got injured . Why did you fired the gun even after seeing the lump in the barrel that also a 7mm rifle . Good to know you are safe be carefully next time .', ''),

So, if imported pieces will keep on coming who will buy the Pak-Turkey Handgun. \n\nOrient Traders told they have placed an order of some but were rejected so no chances of getting a NIB piece.

It was thick uninhabited forest near Indian border. Bear came down the mountain. It was about 50 meters away when we saw it. We were shocked, and stood still. Bear did not looked towards us, went down to the river, crossed it and climbed up in the even thicker forest on other side.\nEvery year local folks and Gujars (herdsmen) encounter these bears. They do attack humans and their animals. some time bears are killed in self defense or to protect live stock, but it is kept secret.[/QUOTE]\n\nCorrect. A man called Jumma Khan was attacked and killed by a black bear in Swat and his wife injured when walking with his family one evening a few years ago. Luckily his little daughter was unhurt. After this incident the a wave of fear spread across their local village and people stopped going towards the local/village forest.\n\nSuch attacks are unexpected and shocking surprises when happen and are quite possible in Pak areas specially in areas you mentioned or any others areas with forests and mountains. In many areas like KPK/ Punjab other wild animals like wild boars and Jackals are on a higher increase particularly in maize crop ( makaee) days and these animals do attack human.\nIn Khaneywal Punjab a couple of wood loggers were attacked a few yrs ago one was instantly killed and the boar bit on the other loggers right arm and was had hold of his arm in the mouth for at least half an hour chewing on it until it the arm was completely amputated from the body and then took his right arm in its mouth towards the Forrest leaving the poor man disabled with only left arm for life. There shocking and horrifying thing was a few ppl had gathered and made various attempts to save and release the man''s arm from the boars mouth hitting it on its head with axes but that had absolutely no affect on the boar and he continued chewing on his arm. Some of you may have seen the video on Youtube already. \n\nMy uncle who is a brigadier in Pak Army told me once he was driving back I think from Muree in the middle of night when all of a sudden a mountain lion or leapord/ Cougar something like that came out of the forest and crossed the road In front of his car and disappeared into the forest. I didn''t ask what type exactly it was because he used the word "sher" but whatever type it was had he not been in the car and him or any one walking that time would have been prone to a fatal attack that time. \n\nI still remember myself once in 1995 I went for a long walk up the mountain in our village and while climbing back down I took the remote isolated route and soon as I climbed down I saw a bunch of at least 5/6 What looked like jackals walking slowly not too far away from, I had a local .22 on me I took it out and had it ready in my hand but luckily soon they disappeared in the bushes and the next day I tried to fire the pistol it wouldn''t fire. Thank God I didn''t have to fire it the day before. \n\nThe retaliation time during such attack when a wild animal like a bear, wild boar etc charges at you should not be more than a split second. A reminder to those who carry their defence gun unloaded or nicely wrapped in a big silky cloth inside a nice holster, thats one reason I always carry my stoeger Cougar chambered n locked thanks to its ambidextrous de cocking mechanism specially after the evening.

I have lived in that area my self for a few years and still do visit. Theres an air force base near nathia gali, in the year 2005 there were frequent sightings of these leopards near human settlement. so the base authorities set a trap (a cage with a goat inside) and they actually succeeded in catching 2 leopards that year. Both were handed over to the wildlife department. But let me assure u that these leopards do not attack humans. Only the injured leopards do, as they aren''t fit enough to prey on other animals such as monkeys (which are in abundance in that area). And when they do attack humans, they mostly do it from behind and when the person is sitting (mostly), as in the sitting posture the person appears to be a smaller animal. Regards', ''),

The elder sister of teh P 07 duty. She comes wiht 3 grip sizes for small to large hands. and 19 round capacity. And I actualy found it concealable. ANd light and balanced as well. She is a sweet gun. As a first weapon i would not recommend you to go for the Glock. A weapon without a hammer or a decocker or a manual safety.  It does not have the option of being carried with hammer down. since it does not have a hammer to begin with. \r\n\r\nNo fire arm is forgiving towards errors. But the Glock is even less forgiving then most. As my instructor used to say "There is no sorry after an accidental discharge. its curtains. Game over! \r\n\r\nOf course in the end its all your choice. But I would council u to kind of "work" your way to a Glock. \r\n\r\nAs regards the weapon itself... The Karachi market has a lot of those. Last couple of weeks I have been visiting the market sporadically. Let me know when you get your license issues sorted out.

So, not only do you have to pay for the knife, you have to pay for the "privilege to buy one".

Among Hinderers and other full custom knife brands, the ones that get expensive have options for special blade grinds, special heat treating, different handle materials such as carbon fiber, titanium, zirconium, high speed steels, Damascus, Timascus, Zirca-Ti, even pearl, ivory, jade, gold, and much more exotic stuff. Different handle designs, and different pocket clip designs and materials are offered as well. It gets ridiculous. With fancier knives, the bulk of the cost is not in the materials, but the time it takes for the maker to form and fit those materials, originality, and the maker''s "artistic vision" is what people pay for. Another factor with high tech steel is the wear and tear on machines and the extra time it takes to form. For example, regular steel is easy to form and grind into a blade, but with a high tech steel, it may take 5 or 6 belts to grind the blade instead of 2 or 3, and it may take 2 or 3 bits to drill a hole instead of 1. At the end of the day, custom knives really won''t cut better than a $5 blade, just like a CZ won''t kill a person any deader than a TT, but this is taking things to the next level where people don''t even use their knives to cut, but rather carry them as "pocket jewelry or just collect them as pieces of art.', ''),

I once saw a small knife (not bigger than 6" total) worth I think 400 euros in Italy and when I asked the noob question "Why is it so expensive?" I got a weird look at first than a lengthy lecture from the vendor, in short the maker only makes 10 to 12 knives in a year and that particular one had an invory (real ivory) handle with a very special steel blade.

Full Tang.\n\nCurrently Gerber is a sub-division of Fiskars Brands Inc, owned by the Fiskars company of Finland\n\n1-USER OPINION:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]31510[/ATTACH]\n\nwell it was a first sight liking (not Love ) due to its looks. When i handled it i thought oh its fits in my hands like it was made specifically for my little hands ( i have small feminine hands ).\nI asked shopkeeper to show fresh pack GERBER PROFILE KNIFE, i read all features and Made In U.S.A was clearly written on the back of package. I asked the price and it was too affordable I didn''t\neven tried to bargain. Actually i was looking for GERBER PARACORD Knife but I instantly bought Gerber Profile. Came to home Happily, opened the package and inspected knife from every aspect. It is\nwell built, very nice non slip handle and traditional hunting knife looks. There is a thumb rest on the start of blade spine to secure knife in hand. Handle have finger grooves too, quite help full while handling.\nThere were some factory machine processing marks on the blade lightly hidden under Titanium Nitride coat. Edge was not sharp\nbut not dull too. Now something about Sheath. Traditional Sheath is just O.K with a belt loop and wrap-around-loop around knife handle to hold it tight inside sheath. Wrap around loop will tear after\nsome time. Long story short its not a heavy duty sheath.\n\n15/20 Marks.\n\n2-MATERIAL:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]31511[/ATTACH]\n\nTo be Honest I was not satisfied with metallurgy. It was made of soft stainless steel with Titanium Nitride coating which will help in wear and tear but not in heavy and abusive usage (which I was looking for).\nIt will get dull very soon after some heavy use in the field like chopping wood for camp fire.\nTextured Handle Rubber is fine non slip if even its wet, will not hurt hand in prolong use, attached to tang with 4 hex screws. There is hole for lanyard. Personally I liked the material and design of handle.\n\n12/20 Marks\n\n3-VERSATILITY:\n\nWell to be honest most of us including me don''t use our expensive knives at extreme so like this knife, so as a general purpose knife  it is well built knife. One can use it for cutting ropes, dressing game animal,\nmaking fire tinders and sticks etc. Very good to keep in vehicle, home, work place and backpack. Very light weight so you can carry it all day, easy to use at any time, concealable.\n\n17/20 Marks.\n\n4-LOOKS:\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]31512[/ATTACH]\n\nIts one of most beautiful knife in my collection. Traditional hunting looks, well Titanium Nitride coated blade, Beautiful textured handle and a really adorable sheath. It scores highest in beauty.\n\n19/20 Marks.\n\n5-USER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nOf course I will recommend it to any one, from hunters to factory workers and newbies in knives like me (yeah really). It will serve you very well any day, any time, but remember edge will get dull soon after some serious workout this is not a workhorse type knife but for general purpose its well recommended.\n\n18/20 Marks.\n\nTOTAL MARKS: 81 out of 100.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nGERBER PROFILE Hunting Knife is one best bang for the buck knife, it will serve you very well and if used with proper care it will last long ( actually it comes with limited life time warranty). As i mentioned early I was looking for an ultimate Hunting, Survival knife, Gerber Profile is not this, but still worth of every penny i have paid. You will not regret.\n\nSIDE NOTE:\nSpecial thanks to to our member and friend Brother Hesab Magsi.

Should watch.\n\n[B]Ip Man 2[/B]\n\nThis is the story of Yip Man, the first master of Wing Chun style who officially opens a martial arts school in Hong Kong where already several other (rather hostile to newbies) schools are operating. Things suddenly take an icy turn when a European boxer named Twister intimidates and insults some martial arts students performing a Chinese fighting arts display. A Chinese master challenges him and the match ends up with the death of the Chinese master from the hands of Twister who goes on to challenge any Chinese master in an open match. There is no-one but Yip Man to accept the challenge. I''d rate it 9/10. Must watch, if you like fighting movies.\n\n[B]Pompeii[/B]\n\nThis is made in the background of the horrible disaster of the city of Pompeii (this city was completely destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 72 BC). Two slaves are to fight in an arena where the champion apparently wins his freedom. The governor of Pompeii wants investors for his metropolis projects and the only man willing to invest (the Roman embassador) demands the hand of the governor''s girl in return. And in the meantime, the volcano keeps sending seismic waves, which grow in frequency and intensity as time passes. I''d rate this movie at 4/10. Quite useless. Sort of Titanic copy, only here it''s about a whole city, instead of just a ship.\n\n[B]The Raid Redemption[/B]\n\nThis has already been reviewed and rated by fellow members. I don''t think it''s as good a movie as suggested though, but I have rather different choices.', ''),

You will find all sorts of information here.\nIt would have been better if you read through the forum first and then opened a thread, would have saved your time.\nNow a brief answer to your questions.\nFirstly license are banned for the time being, you can carry with your license in a concealed way and in some places you need a 144 permit that is when they put a ban on carrying. But its better to have license and permit while carrying.You can only shoot some one in the public place when your life is in danger and there is no going back, Non fatal shots, which make you control the situation are better involve less hassle than killing some one. This is my opinion.\nfrom your above mentioned Ammo every thing is available, but be aware 7.62x39 is prohibited bore you need a prohibited bore license for that, which is not easy to get. Buckshots and slugs are available of different brands and it depends on what you plan on using them for, people here hunt Wild boars with buckshots, some use slugs for Home defense so its all up to you and what you think is best, the place where you live, the area......\nHope your questions have been answered now look into the legal section for more detailed stuff.\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forumdisplay.php?42-Licenses-%28MOI-amp-Provincal%29-amp-Legal-Issues[/url]', ''),

(613025, ' Okay, some movies most of you probably haven''t seen:\n\n"Time After Time" with Malcolm McDowell, circa 1979.  It''s a low-budget mashup of HG Wells'' "The Time Machine" and the Jack the Ripper mythos, except instead of traveling to the far future to a posthuman world filled with flesh-eating Morlocks, they only went to Hollywood, California in 1979, though I''d bet Hollywood film producers and lawyers would give the Morlocks a run for their money.  It''s a movie that shouldn''t work, but the editing is clean and McDowell''s performance of a Victorian Englishman in the late 20th century was outstanding.\n\n"Tremors."  Wormlike monsters pop up out of the ground and eat people in a small, isolated town.  Sounds like a cross between "Dune" and any generic horror movie.  But... it turned out to be a really good movie.\n\n"Innocent Blood."  A female vampire accidentally converts a Mafia don into a vampire, who then starts converting the rest of his mob.  The vampire teams up with an undercover cop to eliminate the unwanted vampires.  Sounds stupid... but it''s one of the funniest movies I''ve seen in a long time.\n\n"Shaolin Soccer."  A group of underemployed losers also happen to be hotshot martial artists, and form a team to play football.  The version I saw was in Chinese with English subtitles.  Despite the ridiculous-sounding plot, it''s very well done, and downright charming in spots.\n\n"Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning."  A mashup of Star Trek and Babylon 5, a full-length live-action motion picture done by a bunch of Finnish Star Trek fans with homemade sets, clothing, and props.  The audio is in Finnish, with broken English subtitles.  If you''re into either ST or B5, it''s so hysterically funny you''ll probably choke on your own internal bodily fluids.  If you''re not, it''s probably still a pretty good movie.  You want the original version they uploaded to the Internet for free, not the extended version they sold on DVD; the extended version is way too long.', ''),

Mostly, you''ll be concerned that it not warp or split.  Start with the dryest wood you can get; if it''s more than six months old, it''s probably okay.\n\n I would consider adding some internal ribs across the grain, or even a 5mm plywood liner glued to the inside if it looks like splitting might be a problem.\n\n Basically, what you''re building is a chest, or portable cabinet.  Chests get a lot of abuse, so woodworking suppliers stock stamped steel or brass corner pieces to keep the corners from being beaten up.  Some shallow feet or bumpers on the bottom will let you set it down without scratching the bottom.

Ive tested it enough and relied on it enough to carry it for 6 months during the summer months when my G17 is too big to conceal.

The .32 (short) is not to be confused with the .32 acp round which is a pistol round. Our famous .23 bateest bore pistol round. . 32 short is something cancer doc has used in his rossi.

The idea and concept behind the hydrashock is indeed exceptional, however, in the field, the hydrashock (9mm) does not always expand  as it is supposed to due to its lower velocity.So, in my opinion, rather than spending Rs.500 per cartridge on hydrashocks you can go for Barnaul hollow points (Rs.65 each) which have always shown proper expansion (in my experience). This would allow you to practice more often with your self-defense round (as per my guess).[/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=hmd;451126]Bro the standard 9mm round is 115 grain and the heaviest you get is 147grain .

The good thing about federal Hydra Shock is you get it in 124 , 135 and Federal HST comes in 147 grain so you can chose according to your need . There have been criticism for failure to expand in the beginning due to the hollow point cavity clogging . Hydra Shock feature a unique patented center post design notched jacket together they are meant to provide more reliable expansion and deeper penetration .

IMO when you state one of the best pistol under 70k do mention which are the other pistols in this batch, And the Best pistol title varies from your needs to what you plan on doing with it and how well it fit''s your hand.So just stating it''s one of the best pistol under 70k can be a tad bit misleading to newcomers or other silent viewers.It''s like all these fancy shotguns coming out copying the big names,On paper they may be feel good but in field they wont last or give any performance,The Mc27r being compared with the cz duty is an insult to CZ,I know you now own it and have a little bias towards it,But IMO it in NO way can be compared to the Duty its just a cheap over priced replica of the duty.

(613463, ' [QUOTE=shahroze;451287]I think you are pushing it a bit too much, best pistol under 70k?\nWell let me tell you one thing, there is no such pistol which you can honor it by calling [B]best[/B] under any particular price range.In this case it''s 70k Girsan does not even come close to be called best or value for money.Canik''s,Tarus,Norinco,Baikal,Zastava,Stoegar are the ones in the category that have a better repute better resale and aftermarket parts available. IMO when you state one of the best pistol under 70k do mention which are the other pistols in this batch, And the Best pistol title varies from your needs to what you plan on doing with it and how well it fit''s your hand.So just stating it''s one of the best pistol under 70k can be a tad bit misleading to newcomers or other silent viewers.It''s like all these fancy shotguns coming out copying the big names,On paper they may be feel good but in field they wont last or give any performance,The Mc27r being compared with the cz duty is an insult to CZ,I know you now own it and have a little bias towards it,But IMO it in NO way can be compared to the Duty its just a cheap over priced replica of the duty.

While he was at work (and he was mostly at work), he was mumbling absurd phrases. "Dumb phones ... smart phones ... oh God! what shall become of me?!"\n\nHe had also begun saving up from his wages and had made it a mission of his life to buy a smart phone. Gradually days turned into weeks ... and weeks into months. One day he picked up all his savings and went to the city center. There he saw neon lights and proper restaurants and sports cars among many other wonderful things which he had never imagined of.\n\nHe went into a shop which he thought was most likely to contain a smart phone (it was a confectionary) and walked straight to the manager who was reading the newspaper and having coffee [IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/teanews.gif[/IMG]. The manager passed a fleeting gaze at him and said "What may I do for you, Mr?"\n\n"I ... want ... a ... well ... I ... err ... I ..." he began fumbling over words and suddenly came up with "I need to become smart!"\n\nThe manager left what he was doing and thoroughly looked at this queer customer who had come to him with this bizarre statement.\n\n"You certainly need to become smarter, young man." He observed. "But I am afraid I cannot be of much help to you in this regard."\n\n"No no." Tha quickly interposed. "I mean to say that I don''t want to get a thrashing again!"\n\nThe manager involuntarily ran his eyes on the page where the news of escaped mental asylum patients and dangerous convicts were posted. There were actually news of a mental asylum patient who had escaped the premises the previous night and was now missing. He suddenly started feeling very uneasy. He said out aloud "Does anyone in this shop has any intentions to thrash this young man? He is feeling rather insecure about it."\n\nEveryone in the confectionary looked up at Tha and noded their heads in negative. "You see young man, no-one here is interested in thrashing you. So you can stop feeling scared about it."\n\n"No no no!" Tha shook his head vehemently as tears began to gather in his eyes. "I don''t mean the thrashing. I mean to say I want to have my phone smarted." He then paused and weighed the sanity of his last sentence and then corrected it. "I just ... oh God! I just want a smart phone. I WANT A SMART PHONE!"\n\nHe then quickly proceeded to open up his pocket where he had kept the precious savings. With a rattle, several coins dropped on the table in front of the manager. "These are all my life''s savings so far." Tha said in tears. "I have skipped on candies and even gone nights without diapers to save them. Here they are sir. Take them all and give me a smart phone. Please!" With these words, he burst into tears.\n\nThe manager quietly counted all the coins. They were eleven pounds and thirty pence. He put them in the pocket again and was about to tell Tha to consult professionall help when suddenly a girl walked up to them. She had some complaint with the staff, but seeing Tha standing there in tears and the manager with an unpleasant stern look on his face, she forgot her issue. She was a soft-looking, kind-hearted person and tears always moved her.\n\n"Hey, why are you crying big boy?" She enquired Tha who had tears rolling down his cheeks now out of embarrassment and apprehension.\n\n"I want a smart phone. I swear I want nothing but a smart phone." Tha replied between his sobs.\n\n"Hey, it''s all right. You don''t need to cry for that, ok." She wiped his tears and then produced her own smart phone from her pocket. "Here, you can have it. I''d get another one. I was thinking about switching it anyway."\n\nTha was dumbfounded with amazement, gratitude and disbelief! Could anyone give away their SMART PHONE like that?! Soaked in his own tears, he accepted the phone and then thanked the girl who had shown so unworldly generosity to him. "Thank you. Thank you! May you die immediately and be taken straight to heaven where the angels shower you with smart phones made of gems and gold. Amen to that!" He expressed his well wishes for his benefactor.\n\nThe girl laughed and shook his head softly with her hand. "It''s not very nice to pray for someone''s death, now is it?" She then handed him over her smart phone and said. "What''s your name by the way, big boy?"\n\n"Tha. It''s Tha. What''s yours?" Tha replied, pocketing the prized possession carefully.\n\n"My name''s Phantom Grammar." The girl smiled. "I work in that office over there. Come visit me someday."\n\n"I will." Tha replied, taking his savings from the manager. Phantom Grammar then proceeded to register her complaint with the manager and Tha left the confectionary.\n\n[IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/eekx.gif[/IMG] [IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/eekx.gif[/IMG] [SIZE=5]Colossal Spiders![/SIZE]  [IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/spider.gif[/IMG]\n\nTha had procured a smart phone but he was unable to use it. Everytime he tried to do something with it, there was a flashing sign and a beep after which he would hear a feminine voice announcing "Noob alert. Please notice that this is a phone, not a sandwich." Needless to say, Tha had been trying to eat the thing.\n\nOne day he saw that same kid (the 5th grade, who had thrashed him thoroughly) conveniently using his smartphone, and ran up to him. "Hey bro! How do eat this thing?"\n\nThe kid looked quizzically at him and then replied "You don''t eat it, weirdo. You use it. Do you have Skype i.d.?"\n\n"What i.d.?"\n\n"Skype i.d." The kid replied. "Like ... the thing you use to talk to other people over the web."\n\n"The web?" Tha was startled, for spiders always scared him.\n\n"Yes. The worldwide web. Internet, man. Where have you been living?"\n\nBut Tha was not there to listen to him. Gasping for breath and terribly scared, he had ran to his father. "Father father! Terrible news! Horrible news! Spiders have grown unimaginably giant. Their webs are now worldwide!"\n\nIt was only after a lot of reassurance and weeks of explanation that his fear and trauma gradually disappeared. He would still sometime mumble "Giant spiders ... worldwide web ... oh God no!" in his sleep and then suddenly wake up in the middle of the night, soaked in sweat.\n\n[IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/bananarock.gif[/IMG]  [SIZE=5]Mother Google[/SIZE]  [IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/google.gif[/IMG]\n\nHow exactly Tha learned about Google is something which can only be conjectured. There are no first hand witnesses of this vital find, so we can only assume that he might have searched google over google and came up with the google results about google.\n\nBut his journey in the dark dungeons of the worldwide web did not end at Google. He later made important online discoveries, one of which was Wikipedia. He named it "The Magic Shite" (for some queer reason, he always called websites ''webshites''). He learned that he could find almost anything and everything with the deadly combo of Google and Wikipedia.\n\nOne day a customer came to the bistro and before he could place any order, Tha proudly claimed "Sir, you need to place no order, for I know already what you will want to have!"\n\n"How the devil ..." the customer was shaken, considering him a mental asylum runaway (this was not the first time someone had assumed that about him, though). "How on earth is that possible?"\n\n"Just tell me your name and your locality and I''d tell you what would be your preference."\n\n"Very well. If you wager on it." The burly customer replied grumbly. "Gingerman - East London. Now tell me what would be my preferences?"\n\nTha opened his convenient magical tool, Google, and wrote in the search box "What would Mr Gingerman of East London prefer to have in lunch?" This google search resulted in "No match found for your search terms" which Tha conveniently translated as such: "Sir, I am sure you haven''t come here to eat anything. You only want to pass some quality time here and you are probably searching for the spiders which spun the worldwide web. Am I right?"\n\nIt took weeks for his bruises to heal completely, but he developed a permanent limp in his leg where that burly man had kicked him. That day he learned the disappointing lesson that even Mother Google could not provide him with all the answers ...\n\n[IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/cooldance.gif[/IMG]  [SIZE=5]Chat Rooms: The Ultimate Paradise[/SIZE]  [IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/argue.gif[/IMG]\n\nSome people conjecture that Tha discovered the world of chatrooms through Google, but there are clear proofs that this is not the case. It was Phantom Grammar who informed him of these magical escape corners of the worldwide web. "There you can be what you want to be." She had told him. "And nobody would be the wiser."\n\nTha tested her claim by joining a chatroom with the nick "NaughtyPari" and claimed he (she rather) was a teen girl living in Trinidad. He was amazed when nobody asked him to prove his claim. He later tried posing as the president of America, but apparently no-one offered enough respect to this the president-in-the-chatroom and Tha soon returned to being NaughtyPari.\n\n[IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/adminpower.gif[/IMG]  [SIZE=5]The Ultimate Career: Keyboard Warrior![/SIZE]  [IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/computersteal.gif[/IMG]\n\nOne day in the chatroom someone with Far-Car nick stated that Hazrat Bullay Shah did not have an authoritative take on Islam and was more inclined towards preaching self development and inner cleanliness. Tha immediately went through his magic shites and found out that he could actually claim the opposite. He immediately waged a war against it, claiming that Far-Car was a heretic, a blasphemic and was badmouthing Bullay Shah.\n\nWhen asked to bring proof for his claims, Tha made another claim that the proofs were in Persian language. When another chatter (his nick was Woot-Woot) told him that he could interpret and translate Persian, Tha immediately changed his statement and said that he meant to say that the original text was in a Peruvian library and that it was only a typo that he had written Persian in place of Peruvian. He was thinking about going offline in case someone from Peru happened to be on the chatroom, but then Phantom Grammar saved his online life again and changed the topic. She had long since taken the role of his caretaker and always made sure that he did not fall into serious online trouble.\n\nSince then, Tha has involved in countless online debates ... some of the important ones being why the rice grains were white, how did a mosquito fly, how many bacteria could fit on a pinhead and last but not least, were homo erectus and australopithecus (two primitive human races) really extinct or could they have any survivors still in the world?\n\nIt is not known whether Tha "won" or "lost" the last debate, but let it suffice to say that his own existence proves that primitive human races are still present in the world and some of them have even found their way online (that is, assuming Tha did not hatch from the water-gerbill''s egg as stated earlier in the start of this biography).\n\n[IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/lies.gif[/IMG]  [SIZE=5]Bibliography[/SIZE]  [IMG]http://marked.hostei.com/emots/readrules.gif[/IMG]\n\nThese sources have been used in writing this biography.

(613520, ' [QUOTE=rizwan;427149]is firing pin and extractor need opening and oiling during cleaning?thanks[/QUOTE]\n\nVery rarely, and when you do, no lube is needed on the firing pin. That actually has a lot to do with the subject of grease or oil. Grease is better in that it''s thicker, stays where it''s applied, and remains there for longer, but that is also its drawback. It attracts and sticks dust, sand, powder, and whatever other particulates that get around your gun. Dirt will also stick to oil, but to a much lesser degree. So decide for yourself based on the merits of each type of lube. For a gunfight in the desert, probably not a good idea to have gobs of grease in the action of your gun. But if it''s for use under controlled environments such as at a range, then no problem greasing it up. Also remember that even among the same models, each gun is unique, so experiment with yours. Some may run optimally very wet, whereas others are better with a thin film. Furthermore, I believe that a high performance motor oil is an excellent option for guns. Even in your average car, the pistons operate at higher temperatures, under more stress, at higher speeds, and for a lot longer durations than the the action of a firearm. So to me it only makes sense, that since the internals of an engine operate in a much harsher environment than the parts of a firearm, motor oil is more than sufficient for a gun. \nAnyways, that''s just my $.02 so YMMV :)', ''),

(613522, 'Px3 short review AOA.. I went to an arms dealer today in lahore to see this px 3.. I thoroughly examined this pistol and found that its of very poor quality. Its not made by norinco. It is made by some local manufacturing plant in china. Its quality is not even close to that of np22 by norinco. I noticed tooling marks on this pistol which are not present on any pistol made on a cnc plant. Its mags are of very low quality. There are welding marks on both sides of the magazine.  When u rack the slide back, it gets scratched up with the barrel. Its trigger pull is awful. Even on single action it pre travel is full of friction. Plastic grip is the worst. And pistol was sold to a customer and he returned it due to malfunction. Its magazine spring is very much under powered. Plastic mag follower is made of cheapest plastic. Its locking or disassembly lever is made of thin metal (patri) rather than a proper metal lever present on a np 22. I have seen locally made beretta clone by islamuddin arms.. I must say that beretta clone made by moon star islamuddin arms on cnc plant is of much superior quality than this china made px3. Mags of 14 shot desi 30 bore locally made are of higher quality standard than this px3 mags. I am posting these pics which i took from my iphone 5 camera so that these low built quality signs can be seen in these pics. Actually when i heard the news that now a chinese imported 30 cal pistol in high capacity of 17 shots is available, I really got excited and decided to buy this immediately. But after having a look at its built quality and standard I wont buy it and I dont recommend anyone to go for this px3. And yes 30 bore stamped on this pistol clearly shows that it is ordered to a local chinese manufacturer by Pakistani importer to make this pistol according to his demands. Otherwise internationally no one uses the terms 30 bore or 12 bore. I had this thing in mind but still wanted to go for it considering that its still a china made pistol. But unfortunately its not the case and I havent seen any other china made weapon of so poor quality than this ever.', ''),

One also asked me technical reasons of it and going further deep and expressing vast knowledge, raised a question about chemical treatment on metal and grades of metal used. You can see brother i wrote this thing multiple times that in every means russian is better than chinese. Wether its accuracy or built quality or parts fit, finish and feel. What i believe is that these type of questions and criticism is just to discourage and impose on one that he''s new on pakguns with few posts thus cannot make such a knowledgable comment based on experience and cannot claim a such things which majority here is not in favour of. \r\n\r\nBrother i also own an old production Type 54 with 66 in triangle (norinco 66 plant marking) pistol since many years. Its too been on my bedside since years now and it works flawlessly.. No doubt on that but still I prefer an original russian TT due to its quality, accuracy and great feel. I 100% agree with you about the feel of russian TT.. Its a really solid feel when you rack its slide and fire it. Every part of russian TT has that sturdy feel.. Its parts are more finished and rounded unlike new chinese and serbian rough metal pistols. I dont know why people have a problem in understanding this and keep on arguing that chinese and serbian are latest production with latest production techniques so they are better than russian. I even wrote that for now u just forget about russian TT. Talk about old chinese and new chinese pistols. There is a drastic difference in quality in old and new chinese pistols made by norinco. Old pistols are of very high finsh and quality than new production by china.   \r\n\r\nAnyways brother keep on posting..

This year,  at the IWA & [I]OutdoorClassics [/I]expo in Nuremberg (Germany),  the NORINCO company announces the conclusion of over two years of  research and development with the launch of a new variant of the NP-42  platform.\n\n\n\n  \nDubbed the Qx4, the new NP-42 variant comes  with a reinforced polymer frame, sporting an ergonomic grip and a  manual safety switch; it also features a frontal MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny  rail for tactical accessories, while the massive machined steel slide  sports front slide serrations and fixed sights.\nMuch like many other  NORINCO products, the Qx4 NP-42 version appears somewhat crude, but is  an overall acceptable performer in service and defensive uses, and  appears to be quite solid in construction.\n\n\n\nThe  main peculiarity of the NORINCO NP-42 Qx4 pistol is the availability in  a wide array of calibers &#8722; including 9mm, .45 ACP and even the good old  7.62x25mm Tokarev round, still highly regarded in Asia, Africa and the  Middle East due to the wide availability of ammunition and its  undoubtable stopping power capabilities. \n\nThe  pistol will be available in all the different calibers from factory;  the original project dictated for caliber interchangeability through the  replacement of some components, but whether or not this capability has  been retained in the factory version, it has not been clarified by the  NORINCO representatives at IWA.

How DSA manages to sell their product abroad shouldn''t be a point of concern because they would be competing with leading brands, so would have to produce quality firearm...[/QUOTE]\n1911''s wouldn''t be half as popular if you couldn''t get a good one for less than $1000. The price generally doubles here for each level you want to go up in the 1911 world... It starts at around $350 for a Norinco (very good quality 1911, and a popular foundation for custom builds), to around $700 for something like a Remington R1, then around $1500 for something at the level of a Kimber like the Tactical II, and double up again to $3000 if you want an Ed Brown Kobra Carry. There are in betweens as far as brands,  and prices overlap depending on models and options, but that''s the basic structure among the big names. Currently the two most significant/popular import brands are Norinco and Sig Sauer. Norinco pretty much owns the market at the less expensive end, as most people agree (myself included) that their product is simply better than the Rock Island and Armscor offerings for the same price. Sig pretty much just jumped onto the 1911 bandwagon, and at that level, most people would rather go with a name known for 1911''s such as Colt, Remington, or Springfield (regardless that today''s Springfield is a different company than the original Springfield Armory), or step up to a Kimber. \n\nIf the DSA''s make it here, it would be interesting to see where in the market they will compete. At the mid range and up, people will pay for the brand and its reputation as much as the product itself.

(613543, ' [QUOTE=Bhatti1965;450928]I don''t think the AR15 bolt carrier makes full auto impossible, after all people install tac-con triggers along with bump fire stocks and the rifles shoot close to full auto RPM. Also in America people put drop-in sears into their ARs which make them legally full Auto, with the same AR15 bolt (as per my limited knowledge). Many companies make full auto BCGs and they can be changed out any time. I don''t think its much of a benefit or much of a capability to have one or the other. Again this is just my opinion and I am only learning. BTW Awesome looking rifle Fudgepacker![/QUOTE]\nThanks for the compliment bro, I appreciate it! Just FYI, bump fire stocks are very different from full auto. They are legal because each shot still requires a press of the trigger ie. a 30rd magazine still takes 30 presses of the trigger to empty, whereas with FA, a mag of any size can be emptied with a single press of the trigger. They can''t be controlled nearly as precisely as an actual machine gun either (if a machine can even be considered precise), so they are considered more of a novelty than anything else. Also, people actually can not legally make full auto anything anymore over here, by any means. 1986 was the cutoff date for FA, so all civilian owned machine guns are at least that old.', ''),

(613566, ' Hmd, to be very fair and honest. To be very unbiased. Here is my confession:\n\nBoth Glock 19 Gen 4 and CZ P-07 Duty are excellent weapons in the polymer category. Both "brands" have a reliable track and combat record. It all boils down to personal preferences. IMHO get the newer CZ P-07 with improved ergonomics and eliminated minor glitches. You will save money (lots of it), you will never regret purchasing it, you can depend on it exactly as you would with a Glock and you will be thankful to me.\nThis statement is coming from personal experience encompassing a CZ P-07 Duty that fired more than 1000 rounds of various brands/load without being field stripped and cleaned once. Most of the rounds fired in temperatures around 45 degree Celsius. All in a time span of 5 months. It never failed on me when I encountered a failed car snatching attempt. What else can I say to testify or vouch for this great handgun. Lovely trigger (could be improved though).\n\nAs for the Glock? Yes it exceeds the CZ P-07 Duty in the following ways:\n1.  Lesser parts. Rest, you get the point.\n2.  Seemingly sturdier polymer technology.\n3.  Interchangeable back straps. Although I never needed one.\n4.  Serrations, grip pattern including finger spacing/ placement (not angle).\n5.  Loads of accessories. Although realistically speaking, an average owner would just need sights, extra mags and two holsters. But that''s just me. For anybody else, the sky''s the limit.\n\nI could compare both handguns realistically in the real world scenario, not from marketing perspective or on paper specs, but I don''t have that trusty CZ with me right now (traded it in). There is no denying that Glock will outlast the Duty but that may be the time when you would be a great grandpa.\n\nRegards', ''),

Let me clarify again that I am here to learn and I sometimes ask the questions which bug me a lot (about guns and ammo of course, not about dinosaurs, plesiosaurs or sudoku logic). Otherwise I just keep my head low and try to stay away from bugging/annoying respectable senior members who take a sizable amount of their precious time to contribute content to this forum which is of course a goldmine of information for rookies like myself.\n\nNow, if you look at my posts in other sections of the forum (the knives and the airgun sections specifically), you would notice that I do post on-topic stuff too. When I got my sword delivered, I tried and did a thorough review of it to help fellow members. You can find that detailed review about the sword in the Knives sub-section. It''s only that when I don''t have anything useful to contribute, I just read the valuable info posted by respectable senior members and keep my little stupid fingers from running around, spilling dinosaurs'' blood all around the place. No sir. I can promise you I have never done it and neither do I plan to do that in the future. I am a peace-loving, law-abiding, God-fearing member of this forum, trying to learn about guns (mostly about handguns and pcp airguns, as we don''t have any category about crossbows).\n\nOnce again sir, if you were offended by my little silicon particles scattering around the place, I assure you that I am no e-anarchist and I do not intend to offend, annoy or otherwise harm the members of this forum or deviate from it''s mission.

The thing is that i went to the market to buy this pistol actually. When i saw its built quality, i changed my mind.

I have also upgraded my glock 19 with several upgrades like night sights and some extenders etc.. But see that is just to upgrade the current weapon to make it efficient and suitable to my likings.

Each shell has to be loaded individually, so picture this... that drum (cylinder) is not removable, so you insert one shell, turn the cylinder a bit, insert next shell, turn, insert, and so on. Still, before you can shoot, you have to wind the thing up like some old fashioned clock, just so the cylinder will turn after each shot. Then when it finally comes time to shoot it, just imagine the worst trigger in the world. Seriously, it really feels more like working a lever on an industrial machine, than pressing a trigger. Then you have to unload each of the spent shells... what do you think this is?! Of course it doesn''t eject them automatically! :lol: Anyways, yes you really do have to manually remove each spent shell one at a time, like the opposite of the loading process. But the good news here is, yes there is good news, are you ready for it? There''s a built in rod to poke each shell out with.

Since you have put up this query I assume that you are already in possession of a valid firearms license since without said license it is not possible to procure a weapon legally.\r\n\r\nThe CF 98 is well below 70k and is retailing in Karachi at around 42 to 45k NIB (New in Box) \r\n\r\nA used peice can be purchased from 32 to 35k.\r\n\r\nThe CF is an excellent weapon for a newbie with features that are hard to come by even in weapons worth twice the price.  \r\n\r\nIt has a dedicated LCI (loaded chamber indicator both visual and tactile that enables u to know the weapon is loaded at a glance. (Or if its dark though touch) \r\n\r\nIt is  medium size that enables it to be CCed (conceal carried) Its polymer frame makes it light weight so carrying for long time periods is not a stain. More ever its polymer frame means no fear of it rusting. \r\n\r\nIt has a  rotating barrel mechanism that decreases felt recoil. Handy for a new shooter. \r\n\r\nIt has a decocker and manual safety combo lever that means u can safely lower the hammer on a live round and can put the weapon on safe as well when loaded. Also has a firing pin safety. \r\n\r\nIts mags and other accessories are cheap and easily available. \r\n\r\nIt has as small indentation behind the rear sights so that if the sights are accidentally misaligned they can be realigned again. Something I have never seen in any other weapon as yet. It even has a lanyard loop to tie the weapon to a string. \r\n\r\nIt has been designed for the Chinese army and as such is tailor made for people with smallish hands. \r\n\r\nThe older generation CF 98 has large  glow sights that glow in the dark once charged with bright light. \r\n\r\nIts newer generation model the NP 42 has a textured grip and accessory rails for laser/ tactical light combos but no glow sights. \r\n\r\nIn its price range it has few equals and no superiors. Its only drawback is that it has been known to have issues with Armscor brand of (made in philipines) hollow point ammo. \r\n\r\nThe only other 9mm weapons in its price range are the NP 22 and the NP 34. These 2 NP (Norinco Pistol) pistols are made on the venerable SIG platform but are full metal, heavy and devoid of a manual external safety. They are built like tanks but harder to conceal carry. The NP 22 like the CF 98 has a 15 round capacity while the NP 34 has a 13 round capacity. Their mags are 6k or so in hte Karachi market while the CF mags are 4k inthe same market.', ''),

(613721, ' [QUOTE=TRX;450868]Okay, some movies most of you probably haven''t seen:\n\n"Time After Time" with Malcolm McDowell, circa 1979.  It''s a low-budget mashup of HG Wells'' "The Time Machine" and the Jack the Ripper mythos, except instead of traveling to the far future to a posthuman world filled with flesh-eating Morlocks, they only went to Hollywood, California in 1979, though I''d bet Hollywood film producers and lawyers would give the Morlocks a run for their money.  It''s a movie that shouldn''t work, but the editing is clean and McDowell''s performance of a Victorian Englishman in the late 20th century was outstanding.\n\n"Tremors."  Wormlike monsters pop up out of the ground and eat people in a small, isolated town.  Sounds like a cross between "Dune" and any generic horror movie.  But... it turned out to be a really good movie.\n\n"Innocent Blood."  A female vampire accidentally converts a Mafia don into a vampire, who then starts converting the rest of his mob.  The vampire teams up with an undercover cop to eliminate the unwanted vampires.  Sounds stupid... but it''s one of the funniest movies I''ve seen in a long time.\n\n"Shaolin Soccer."  A group of underemployed losers also happen to be hotshot martial artists, and form a team to play football.  The version I saw was in Chinese with English subtitles.  Despite the ridiculous-sounding plot, it''s very well done, and downright charming in spots.\n\n"Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning."  A mashup of Star Trek and Babylon 5, a full-length live-action motion picture done by a bunch of Finnish Star Trek fans with homemade sets, clothing, and props.  The audio is in Finnish, with broken English subtitles.  If you''re into either ST or B5, it''s so hysterically funny you''ll probably choke on your own internal bodily fluids.

And in my jurisdiction, not only are they specifically not weapons, but if you have any "mobility" problems or gray hair, your possession and use of a stick is protected by law, just like crutches or a wheelchair.\n\n Besides discretion, a stick gives you the option of a level of response below "deadly force."

(613807, ' AoA Everybody.\r\n\r\nKindly allow me to offer my two cents on the subject:\r\n\r\nhow to clean your firearms actually varies and depends upon the number of rounds that have been fired.\r\n\r\nfor general / routine cleaning: \r\n\r\nyou may use kerosene. I prefer diesel cause its has slight lubricating properties to it and doesn''t leave metal bone dry.\r\n\r\nfor really nasty and stubborn carbon deposits you may resort to harsher chemicals/solvents. the best and probably the cheapest is ordinary carburetor cleaner or brake cleaner depending upon which is easily available and cheapest of the two.\r\n\r\nnow in my humble quest to find better cleaning solutions I have learned that it is always better to employ manual labor (self) then making use of the harsh chemicals cause 1. they are hazardous and 2. they are expensive\r\n\r\nwhat I am trying to say is that I would rather use force and repetition instead of strong (and mostly carcinogenic) solvents and remember! most firearms are actually destroyed by solvents than anything else.\r\n\r\nso...how should one clean the barrel of their firearms. well.... I have mostly converted to using simple and ordinary automotive polishing compound. works like a charm. doesn''t leave a single scratch or residue in your barrel (including your lungs, kidney etc.) and cleans your barrel to the point of "new in box/never used".\r\n\r\nas far as lubrication is concerned:\r\n\r\nwell....to be honest, anything works. so why waste money on expensive lubricants that work just the cheap and often no-name products.\r\n\r\nthis is what I do: we like to call this "PG-Lubricant"\r\n\r\nmix equal parts of:\r\n\r\n1. ZIC Dextron 3 ATF\r\n2. ZIC XQ 5w-40 synthetic motor oil\r\n3. Kerosene\r\n\r\nin the end, you just cannot get a better lubricant than this as long as you  stick to blued, parkerized and plated (chrome, nickle etc) surfaces and avoid painted surfaces.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I have told you before that norinco makes handguns for different regions with different names and difference in the location of stamps but still they have norinco box, norinco manual etc with it unlike the case with highlink. Highlink is an exporter only.. They have nothing to do with manufacturung of weapons. This thing cleared. \r\nNow you can clearly see what i have written in my review about px3 quality. Its looks and feels like a dara made cheap quality pistol. Cancer doc also ovserved this. Its not just about magazine quality, its also about pistol quality. Its not a cnc manufactured pistol coz ut has tooling marks. I hope you understand what tooling marks are. So this is for sure confirmed that its a very low built quality handgun not made in a cnc plant like norinco pistols. \r\nNow one thing i must say that this is my observation and my opinion about this pistol. If you personally like it then i have nothing to do about it. My sharing and comments are to tell the reality to other gun ehthusiasts that this pistol is not worth buying according to its price demand because its not of that quality. We all know many people who buy 4k desi darra made 30 bore and always say that its really great, we have fired 1000 rounds we have done this we have done that and their list of adoring never ends. So no one can convince them that this is not a good quality weapon. They have their own opinion and own liking. So i am not agruing anything on that as u have bought px3 and u like it. I have just wrote previously that this pistol is not worth buying for 50-55k coz of its poor quality standard. And i have proved that it actually has a very poor built quality by posting its pics. So i think there is no point in any more argument about it. I dont recommend anyone to buy this pistol and my only purpose of review was to inform people here about eye seen reality and help them in making a decision.', ''),

(613929, ' @ HeartTTAK\r\n\r\nI fully agree with you sir.. Russian TTs are the best of all variants by other countries like china and serbia etc.. There are different year models in russian tt pistols. Mostly they are made in tula. The ones which have a star sign are of tula. There are old russian tt pistols with thin straight line grip serrations on slide and there are later models of russian tt which has thick serrations. There are many markings on different parts of russian tt pistols. Actually the markings are russian proof marks by the factory. Eg on the trigger guard u''ll find small cuts like proof marks. Each proof mark indicates a meaning for russian tula production plant. Russian tt pistols are much superior than chinese serbian and all other copies of it. Russian pistols are heavy in weight than a chinese pistol. Russian tt''s metallurgy is highly advanced than chinese and other ones. Top most thing is that russian ones are true Tokarevs. The classic ones. Russian TT''s barrels are not chromed like chinese pistols. Thats why russians are more accurate. Chrome lining always reduces accuracy. There are many other differences between russian tt and chinese ones. Especially in its feel.. The feel of russian tt when you rack the slide..

(613958, ' Respected sir, the reviews i read and the videographic evidence i saw on youtube showed that the problem was not due to clogging but due to lesser velocity of the round. I know the mode of action of the hydra shock but, it cannot be denied that the probability of the 124 grain ammo being the best of both worlds is coupled with the probability of it being a disaster, having neither the velocity of a 115 grain bullet nor the stopping power of a 148 grain round. And speaking quite honestly, i use the 115 grain S&B ammo and i have never been disappointed as i prefer faster moving cartridges over heavier ones because the change in velocity has a greater influence on the energy of the cartridge as compared to that of a change in mass (because, Kinetic energy = ½ * mass * velocity²). And spending Rs. 500 each on ammo just because it MAY expand a little more than your everyday hollowpoint, which costs less than Rs. 100 usually, is neither an intelligent nor an appropriate thing to do as firearm effectiveness depends on your shot placement which needs practice and much more practicing can be done with a resonably priced round as compared to that above 5 times its price!\n[QUOTE=hmd;451126]Bro the standard 9mm round is 115 grain and the heaviest you get is 147grain . So if you use a bullet which is 124grain or 135grain you will get the benefit of both world good penetration and expansion . The good thing about federal Hydra Shock is you get it in 124 , 135 and Federal HST comes in 147 grain so you can chose according to your need . There have been criticism for failure to expand in the beginning due to the hollow point cavity clogging . Hydra Shock feature a unique patented center post design notched jacket together they are meant to provide more reliable expansion and deeper penetration . I personally like 124grain S&B JHP or FMJ due to price and availability if money and availability is not an issue Hydra shock any given Sunday .[/QUOTE]', ''),

(3) Hadit books cover a time period of 23 years ,92 seasons and countless questions from different tribes from all over the known world at that time, about common and their special needs . (4) The verdict and guide lines of Quran is final and not questionable ,but hadit advises according to specific needs,place or customs. (5) Taking a reference from a book of hadit and quoting it with certainty is not advised to common people by true scholars of deen as our beloved Prophet (PBUH) said he who narrates some thing from me which i did not said will go to hell . as we dont know the conditions ( siyaq o sabak)of a hadit and we quote it some where else makes it fall under the up mentioned category. ............... May Allah (SWT) keep us on straight path...... please take and follow the basics of our deen ,do not go for details and complication as a common man ,, we as a common men are advised to be as human as possible ,we are advised not to waste water even if we r on the bank of a river ,we are advised not to kill what u dont want to eat or what dont harm u,even if u r eating ur kill ,we r advised not to kill more than our need .', ''),

U keep chinese metal for some days in open while a after rainy type season and you will notice that i will have spottings of rust. Whereas Russian metal never catches rust.

If someone says the feeling are different, I think its 50 50, I have a TT local which feels more compact then a Russian & I have handled Russians who were not that compact or not giving that feel which was 35k (used) in stainless steel & the other 2 Russian which were black & those were solidly built & one was a bit shorter.\n [B]Why cant you tell the Difference[/B],\n  its because of the wide spread production of the TT, in Sakhna Kot & Dara there are hundreds of TT productions on small basis so definitely only a lucky person will get a solid one & if its solid then its sold in the name of Chinese TTs, & even a peron who was just a trunk maker in a small town near our location mastered in its production & he was able to built the whole TT totally on his own, so the point is the you can not tell by its finish or feel that where is it made, I am damn sure about this because here I have shopkeepers friend & they have handled & sold 100''s of them, they even cant tell you the difference easily, only way is to differ the local from Chinese & Russian is recoil spring,guide rod quality & accuracy but that''s can''t be decided at the point of buying but only after firing it. \nOnly a trustworthy friend & dealer can give you that piece which is a real end-to-end assured made in abroad.\nRegards.', ''),

Have hardly fired 50 rounds from each rifle and I love both of them as long term companions cannot even think to get rid of Darra made.\n\nAnyhow, so ones who are able to distinguish clearly between Original and Fake should go for this PX-3 pistol otherwise those who cannot ( including myself ) should avoid it or take the guidance of some knowledgeable person after all you are paying something more than half a lac rupees for an "in doubt" HANDGUN\n\nBrother if you can get your hand on some quality photographs just like those you posted before but of another PX-3 pistol plz do share them on this forum.\n\nRegards[/QUOTE]\n\nSure brother i will be more than happy to do that.', ''),

(614072, ' [QUOTE=Ameer;451818]We are talking about NP42 specifically, no comparison with other polymers. As, the NP42 has a comparatively lesser barrel life and its not recommended for high power loads in 9mm. I again doubt it for powerful calibers.[/QUOTE]\nYeah but barrel life is just that, the life of the barrel. It has nothing to do with the frame and other components. I personally have never worn out a barrel on any gun, and if you were to adhere to X number of rounds as the life of a barrel, you could simply change it out and the gun is good to go again. Plus there are many guns not officially rated for +P ammo nor do they specify the life of their barrel, like Glock. Its not because their barrels last forever, but they realize that barrel life is so variable, it''s pointless to guess. But, Glock does officially state that calibers are interchangeable among their pistols, that is you can take 9mm, 40SW, and 357Sig, or 45 and 10mm,  then play mix and match with the uppers and lowers. This only leads me to believe that there is no difference in their frame material between large and small calibers. That only makes senses, since the chamber and recoil spring contains most of the pressure anyways. Besides, with Norinco''s experience manufacturing so many different types of firearms in various handgun and rifle calibers, they should know what will hold up and I have full confidence in their material choice.', ''),

I never said that heavy is better. Lolx.. You gave glock example.. Janab glock is a polymer frame... We are only talking abt TT and same platform.. Let me give u a better example.. Norinco type 56 rifle is a stamped sheet receiver.. Russian akm is also a stamped sheet receiver. Norince stamped sheet is thicker than russian metal sheet thus more weight but still russian metal is more durable and rust/corrosion resistant than china metal stamped sheet.. My point is that russian metal is superior than chinese. Mostly people argue that chinese tt clones have chrome lined barrel and russian tt dont so chinese is better. This doesnt really it is.. Non chrome barrel is always more accurate. High-end competition grade rifles and handguns eg cz tactical sport competition pistol also doesnt have chrome lined barrel.. Its a latest production. Cz can make chrome barrel in ts like they have in their handguns but they havent.. Why??? Because ts is a precision shooting competition handgun which requires more accuracy. Chrome barrel always reduces friction and accuracy.', ''),

[/FONT][/SIZE][/QUOTE]\n\nBrother i agree with what you have written. And thanks for sharing your experience. As u have already stated i was not un polite ..  Didnt say anything to hurt anyone but that one member criticised without any reason just to dominate and impose that i am a new member so i cant have knowledge. And yes you can say that the statement i have was a broad blanket type about the quality of russian and chinese steel quality. Sir i am not a metallurgical expert actually. The statement i have with based on my personal experience and what we have been observing since years. Here in Lahore and peshawar if you talk to old gun smiths they also say that russian metal is more durable than chinese as it is more corrosion resistant. Now the thing is that no one has preformed a laboratory test on both the metals to see which grade of metal they are using but I can tell you that from my personal experience. Like it is a fact that non chrome barrel tends to be more accurate than a chrome lined barrel due to the fact that chrome reduces friction between bullet jacket and groves of the barrel. But as you have written that u would go for a chromed barrel any day of the week so i would say its a personal preference. I like original russian TT compared to chinese clone or any other clone of it. I have my own reasons for it. So i think that is totally fair. Now here are people who go and buy a 4k desi darra made tt clone of poor quality and keep on adoring it and keep on telling stories about its specialities reliability. Brother the thing is that me and you cannot convince them that its a poor quality gun and not worth keeping for self defence. So i think its more about personal preferences here.', ''),

(614207, ' [QUOTE=Leon;448391]7mm is not the caliber for even 400 yards.[/QUOTE]\n7mm or 7 X 57,\nIs the grand father of all modern cartridges. The 30-06 is based on it. Same case length increased from 57 to 63 mm and neck dia increased ( inside ) from .284 to 308. Scores of other calibers are based on it.\nIf  NATO was not there the most popular military caliber could have been the 7x57. A number of armies were experimenting with the 7mm.\nThe 7mms long and thin bullets have ideal Ballistic Co-efficients and Sectional densities and these  perform much better than 30 caliber bullets when fired at comparative velocities. The .308 Win was more desirable as a military cartridge due to the 6 mm difference in case length resulting in shorter strokes of machine gun moving parts  and reduced weight of components. Besides the US army weaned on the 30-06  was perhaps not ready to accept the 7 mm, for some reasons like a small difference in barrel life in favor of the 30 cal.\nThere were other compulsions as well which I will discuss later.\nAs a SPORTING OR MATCH  round the 7mm is far superior at long ranges. It has a flatter trajectory than a .308 win and is deflected much less by wind at comparable velocities, at longer ranges it remains above the transonic  and subsonic velocities better than 30 cal bullets of a 308 Win. \nIt has better penetration on big game than a .308 at any range.\nLate FM President Ayub Khan  reduced  taxes on 7 mm rifles and  ammo  to make it cheaper and easily available to the public. \nThe 308 Win is popular due to the military surplus ammo cheaply available and some how people thinking  it is more powerful and effective than a 7mm which is not true.\nIn the F class shooting the world over at 800 and 1000 yards the 6 mm, 6.5mm and 7mm are more popular than the 30 with some what higher recoil and poorer trajectory and wind deflection abilities.\nThe purpose of my writing this is to clear an unfounded  thinking.\nThe 7 X 57 when fired in any good rifle is superb. It''s hunting ammo is cheaper kicks less and more effective at the target end. The 7mm 08 is a great cartridge developed by combining the qualities of the two calibers, a short fat case of the 308 win with the magical 7 mm bullet, a very  efficient light recoiling caliber came about.\nThe 7mm Rem mag which remains my favorite both for hunting and matches restricted to hunting rifles.', ''),

The point I was trying to make is that, where I am, a cane or walking stick is, de jure, NOT a weapon.\n\n This means that A) you can take it in places where weapons are forbidden, and B) since it is not a weapon, any "force multiplier" legal hassles are avoided, should you have to use it.\n\n *IF* things work similarly under Pakistani law - which is quite likely, since most countries have a similar stance as far as "assist devices" - you would avoid a whole lot of potential hassle should you have to use the stick for defense. \n\n You can go through airport security with a stick, and even the TSA or HM Border Force won''t give you any trouble about it.  Bring a sword cane, and you''ll probably get to meet Doctor Jellyfinger for a cavity search.\n\n Even if Pakistan doesn''t exempt assist devices like other countries, you still avoid the hassles of "no weapons" zones, metal detectors, etc. that would give you problems with a sword.\n\n\n Now, the state I live in recently repealed all laws concerning knives.  A few years ago a pocket knife with a 50mm blade could net you a prison sentence.  Now, I can carry anything I want - a sword cane, a Klingon bat''leth, or a Zulu spear - and there''s no law against it, other than on Federal properties, which have a 70mm blade limit.  (overlapping jurisdictions, such fun!)  BUT, if I used a sword cane to defend myself, local law considers the blade to be a "force multiplier", and the prosecutors could make use of that against me in court, even if it was justifiable self-defense.  They can''t use a walking stick against me that way.\n\n Now, after typing all that, I have this sudden urge to get a sword cane... it''s a good thing my wife grabs all the knife and military surplus catalogs before I get to look at them.

I don''t know what perceived benefit there is that people pay 500/rd for Hydra Shoks, but they are not worth that, for what little (if any) increase in actual performance you are getting over the average hp bullet. Since velocity is correlated with likelihood of proper expansion, I''d have confidence in any bullet expanding as long as it has a hole on top, if it''s traveling at Tokarev speeds.\nSeriously though, IMHO  the only "high tech" bullet that actually has some substance behind its claims are Hornady''s Critical Defense. They use a polymer cap at the tip of the bullet which serves multiple purposes. First it encourages reliable feeding by giving the bullet an fmj profile. Second, it prevents the cavity from getting clogged with foreign material. Lastly, it promotes reliable expansion by initiating the mushrooming effect upon impact. It''s been tested to expand consistently, even in conditions that frequently cause Hydra Shoks to fail ie. as a slow moving 38 Spcl shot out of a snub nose revolver. Now that''s a premium defensive round worth paying a bit extra for.', ''),

Pakistan law clearly states on import of semi 223, barrel must be min 18".  It just happens so that this law applies to several South Asian countries aswell. And it''s just happens so that CQA is available from factory with an 18" barrel to meet the standard. Although they are originally 14.5" but slightly modified for these countries. I phyiscally haven''t seen it myself but been told that there is an extension on the barrel which can be removed by a gunsmith to make it into 14.5". The first batch which came by mistake were orignally 14.5". Now what does it do to the gun after removing from new stock batch, I have no idea. But personally I wouldn''t alter anything from factory on an AR except outside furniture which has only beautification function. 223 being just a fast bullet, I wouldn''t hamper the barrel. \r\n\r\nRegards', ''),

What makes for a good bullet is expansion (diameter at widest point), penetration (1 foot FBI minimum), weight retention (percentage), and core separation (or lack thereof, ideally). You can then experiment, I load different bullet types, weights, velocities. Without handloading, you can still try different brands, bullet types, calibers, different weights within calibers, put some sort of bone analog in the gel, form it into different shapes, try different barriers like wood, glass, car door, ect.

It was stuck to his side and was all carefully wrapped up in a piece of semi transparent cloth.[/b][/i] \n\n You probably wasted a fair amount of time just standing there thinking "WTF?!" which is the natural thing to do, and why the defense instructors are so tediously repetitive about "situational awareness" and "be prepared."  Your window of opportunity to make an effective response was about wide as anyone is likely to see in an armed robbery.\n\n From your description the robber sounded like a beginner and badly troubled, unless he had a really smooth line of patter already worked out.    You managed to turn a simple robbery into a lengthy negotiation, which probably significantly reduced the chance of violence.  And you walked away without being hurt, which was a BIG WIN. \n\n But your only options were to hand over your valuables and hope he didn''t shoot you for kicks afterward, or wave your arms and shout "HELP!  THIEF" and hope he ran away without shooting you in annoyance.\n\n A knife or stick gives you the option to do SOMETHING other than handing over your stuff or shouting.  From your description of what happened, there was time to use a stick and beat the guy senseless before he could get his gun out.  If he''d had the gun in his hand already, your options would be much more limited and less favorable, of course.  But the stick, the knife, and even the gun are all options, and the more options you have, the better chance you have to survive.', ''),
(614624, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;452426]Shooting jhp won''t do any more or less wear than fmj, but if you guys like to experiment with bullet performance, forget the the water bottles (although blowing up bottles is fun too!), do it properly and this is a whole other hobby in itself!\n\nThis side of the coin is more about the ammo than the gun. First, get yourself  some ballistic gelatin off the Internet, you can get it pre-made, otherwise it''s just like making jello and you can melt it down to reuse over and over. The mix is 10% by weight, and then you stick it into your fridge. When it becomes solid, you calibrate it with an air gun. If a .177cal BB penetrates it by approximately 8.5cm, then you have the perfect simulation of tissue :) \nTests are done at 10ft and the FBI standard is 4 layers of denim in front of the gelatin block. What makes for a good bullet is expansion (diameter at widest point), penetration (1 foot FBI minimum), weight retention (percentage), and core separation (or lack thereof, ideally). You can then experiment, I load different bullet types, weights, velocities. Without handloading, you can still try different brands, bullet types, calibers, different weights within calibers, put some sort of bone analog in the gel, form it into different shapes, try different barriers like wood, glass, car door, ect. The gelatin captures the bullet for you, and shows what the permanent wound cavity would look like... have fun![/QUOTE]\n\ngood info bro.', ''),

IMHO if we choose a handgun for SD, it should be carried. If carried, it should be chambered. If chambered and came across such an inevitable and uncertain situation, should be used.

What really matters is how determined you are and how well you have analysed the situation.\n\nLets say a swordsman and a person carrying a concealed hangun encounter the same situation. While they are walking casually (but alert) a thug stops his bike 3 feet from them and pulls out a chambered handgun. It will take the cc handgun person just one second to pull out his pistol and shoot. But do you really think he can make it? Remember I said the thug has a chambered gun. He only needs pull the trigger. Do you think the cc handgun person will actually get that decisicive one second he needs? I guess not. I have had swordsplay training and I know one second is a very very long time when you stand at gunpoint. You appear well versed in your pistols. What do you think about the duration of 1 second?

So I will use the element of surprise coupled with my senses which should damn well be in working order at that time.

Its natural that even with standard ammo pistols show wear signs after some thousand rounds.. And with +p or +p+ that wear time will be shortened and system life of any handgun will decrease. But the thing is that no one regularly uses +p rounds.. Even law enforcement agencies dont always use high pressure rounds. They train on standard ammo and for duty they carry high pressure rounds. In Pakistan +p is very rare. Only gun enthusiasts have a know how abt them. Here law enforcement departments dont even really know abt hollowpoints or +p''s.. They use standard fmj ammo on duty which is supplied by government. Only some gun enthusiasts like my self buy 20- 50 rounds of hydra shok type exotic ammo rarely available in market.. The purpose for us is only a fun experiment with few rounds and keep rest of them loaded in the magazine to (show off sometimes) and have a mental satisfaction that we have loaded mags of hydra shok.. Wow it feels so much satisfying.. Lolx. Its just to feel more secure and satisfied after spending 300 to 500 rs per cartridge. Otherwise i dont think that anyone here regularly buys and uses 500rs bullet extensively. So i think there is no harm in having few and firing 3-4 rounds sometimes just for the sake of fun.

In fact when it comes to taking abuse, I''m more comfortable with a polymer frame, simply because aluminum lacks elasticity. That is, once deformed, it doesn''t have that natural tendancy to return to its original shape.\r\nAnyways, that''s just one reason why I chose to go with CZ for my next gun, even though I only shoot standard pressure ammo, having a steel frame just gives a certain peace of mind.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nI have copied this from sig sauer website faq section.. \r\nCan I use +P or +P+?\r\n+P Ammo manufactured to SAAMI/CIP/NATO specs is fine to use as a defensive round or for occasional range use.

(615535, ' Woah, hold up! Take from it what you will, but a lot of things stand out here to me, the following are my opinions and observations from over a decade of working on and shooting Norinco AR''s.\n\nSo that "extension" goes on in place of the flash hider. Is it like a "fake suppressor" or does it actually contact the bullet? If it indeed "extends" the barrel, is it rifled? If its rifled, can it be verified that the rifling will match up? Also how flush is the fitment at the point where the two pieces meet, and is it perfectly in line with the rest of the barrel? Either way, unless that extension piece does not touch the bullet at all, with a two piece barrel like that, you can pretty much throw accuracy out the window. But of course that is just MHO, since I have never shot, let alone heard of, a barrel that scews together like that.\n\nAlso, that gun looks quite different than the CQ''s here. The finish actually looks like the rifles we were getting 20 years ago, which everybody complained about. Those early guns had a paint like finish that came off very easily, and judging from those pics, it already looks like thats happening. The current generation has a very durable parkerized/ceracoated finish.\n\nFurthermore, this gun has a [B]major[/B] issue where the upper and lower meets, on the right side, just above the safety. I simply can not believe Norinco, nor any other company for that matter, would let a gun go out the door with such an obvious and massive defect like that.\n\nLastly, the CQs I am experienced with do not say Made in China by the serial number. That''s probably irrelevant, but what I believe is very much relevant, is that all the rifles I''ve owned are chambered specifically for 5.56mm, but note they are model CQ-A-1, vs the CQ-A depicted above. I am very curious see what other differences there are between the two.', ''),

Don''t know if the engineer , at the time of replying me , was in joking mode or drunk[/QUOTE][/FONT][/COLOR]\nThere are several reasons it doesn''t make sense to me. First of all, if a pin sticks out to mark the bullet as described, it will destroy accuracy by affecting its travel down the barrel. Even small variations in the thickness of chrome plating (just micrometers) will have an adverse effect. Then you have a bullet that''s not going to fly true because it has a little bit taken off one side of it. It doesn''t take a lot to throw it off balance due to centrifugal force, like how a 20lb car wheel is balanced with weights that weigh mere grams. Furthermore, if you have a protrusion in the barrel, can you imagine how much lead and copper will build up at that point.

(615654, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;453385][COLOR=#222222][FONT=Times][/FONT][/COLOR]\nThere are several reasons it doesn''t make sense to me. First of all, if a pin sticks out to mark the bullet as described, it will destroy accuracy by affecting its travel down the barrel. Even small variations in the thickness of chrome plating (just micrometers) will have an adverse effect. Then you have a bullet that''s not going to fly true because it has a little bit taken off one side of it. It doesn''t take a lot to throw it off balance due to centrifugal force, like how a 20lb car wheel is balanced with weights that weigh mere grams. Furthermore, if you have a protrusion in the barrel, can you imagine how much lead and copper will build up at that point. Lastly, such a method of identification is really not necessary, since all guns have microscopic tool marks (unique as fingerprints) that can be matched up to any bullet that goes down their barrel, or any primer their firing pin hits.\n...if you didn''t before, you probably know now how much our Russian friends love their Vodka :lol:\nKidding aside, I''m not doubting you, but just wanted to offer my opinion on the topic.[/QUOTE]\n\nMaybe Zain Bhai got the wrong e-address.', ''),

Did you ever try to interchange the uppers between your norinco and other ar15s you own? If so did they work okay and fit flush? I believe the charging handle and buffer tube are not mil spec, wondering if the other parts(bolt assembly, barrels etc) and uppers are interchangeable?\nWould an after market piston kit just drop in or would it require professional gunsmithing?[/QUOTE]\nHi Khan, I always use an Accuwedge, but uppers and lowers interchange no problem. Take a look at the description and pics of mine on page 34, Noveske charging handle (before that I installed an extended release on the stock handle, which also fit perfectly), Magpul stock (over factory tube), Timney trigger kit, and a bunch of other stuff, they all fit.\nAs far as pistons go, I''m sorry I can''t comment because I fall on the DI side of the debate :)\nAnyways, as far as the kits go... do you really want a piston AR?:boink:\nJ/k! They''re usually plug and play, and may require minor fitting at the most. If you had an AR tool and a good gun vise (some guys stick a block of wood up the mag well and clamp the wood in a regular vise, but that won''t work for this project), you could easily do anything on an AR yourself. The hardest part will be getting your gas block and front sight off.

I have had various Swiss kits and one tactical knife (Rambo inspired lolz) and most were given away to friends during moves. \n\nFor large''ish hands for appropriate size & comfortable grip, a few practical ones (but very good quality) I require for the following:\n\n1.

I''m not criticizing you at all, but would just like to elaborate for everyone''s interest.\n\n"Playing with a gun" is pretty much whenever you''re (when I say "you" I mean anybody) handling a firearm but arent shooting . It be while cleaning, showing it off, dry firing, taking photos, admiring, fondling, etc. Say for instance you pull your gun out to clean. Drop the mag, clear the gun. It cleaned up well. So you decide to snap some pics while it''s shiny. You empty the mag and use the ammo as props, just to spice things up. The whole time, you have in your mind that you''ll put the ammo back when you''re done... and you do. But then you catch a glimpse of the gun at a certain angle that would make a great picture. So you put something in the trigger guard to hold it at just the right angle, and BANG. Sound far fetched? It''s not, because I saw something like that happen (it was actually a youtuber who caught the AD on video, he keeps all ammo in another room now when filming). Dumb things like that happen with unfortunate frequency, and its not because the person is dumb (ok, sometimes it is), but sometimes playing with guns while there''s ammo around is even more dangerous for the experienced shooter. Because they are so used to, like you said, [I]putting things back to their place[/I]... it becomes second nature. Bullets go in mags, and mags go into guns. I personally know someone who took out their HD gun to show off. It was the weekend and there were a bunch of guys sitting around the table after dinner BSing. So the gun was cleared and passed around, the unloaded ammo was put right on the table. There was one guy who wasn''t interested. So my friend took the gun back after everyone else was finished playing with it. Then, that one guy goes "let me see that thing". No problem. The next thing you know, bang! Luckily I wasn''t there, but my friend told me afterwards, he was just about to put the gun away, right before that guy asked to see it, and he didn''t even realize, he had loaded the gun. It happens, ask anyone who''s kept an HD gun for years, decades... what do they do when they''re putting it away? Insert mag, rack slide. Of course not everyone stores their guns loaded like that, but for the ones that do, they don''t think twice about it. \n\nAnyways, no one got hurt in those instances, but stay safe everybody, and have fun!\n\nIf anyone else has stories about AD''s/ND''s, please share. It''s a great way for us to learn what not to do... plus it''s fun to read about :)', ''),

(615785, ' Even shooting on flat ground your bullet travels in an arc. How much you correct for bullet drop obviously depends on how far away you are from your target. First, you must know your bullet path. If there aren''t published specs for the ammo you are using, estimate it yourself by shooting at paper from 25, 50, 100, 150, 200m... then see how far your point of impact is from your point of aim, and chart the arc. You should now know how much higher or lower your bullet will hit at a certain distance. If you want to use mils, remember that 1moa (minute of angle, 360 degrees in circle, 60 min per degree, 60 secs per min) = 1" at 100 yards, 2" at 200, and so on. 1 mil dot = 3.5 moa (approx). \nYou can also use mils to figure your distance. Say you see a deer, and you know that average deer are 3 feet tall. See how many dots high the deer is in your scope, then you can do the math to figure out how far away you are, and then you''ll know how much your bullet will drop at that distance and how many dots you then need to hold over.', ''),

(615787, ' came across this thread just today and remind me good old college days  of 2008. another victim here. in 2008 my uncle was serving as D.O  officer in Distt Bolan at Dhadar Balochistan. his govn Bangla was famous  as hounted house in the whole residential area. after metriculation in  2007 i went to dhadar for addmision in college. Uncle advised me to live  with relatives and warned me about gov house but I decided to stay in  gov house of uncle because it was empty 4 days in a week and there was  no one to disturb except CHOKIDAR (watch man). this was first time when i  was going to live totally alone in the house i was little bit scary ( i am a  human after all ) but mentally i prepared my self not to be scare at any  cost.\nwell first week was silent nothing happened at all and i  starting believing every thing is a rumor but ONE NIGHT when i was  watching t.v after 12am i heard some one is knocking the door i thought i  would be watch man but when i opened the there was no one, i ignored  that may be watch man is making some fun ( he was lil bit free with me  due to his funny nature ). after some time i again heard the voice,  opened the door and again there was no one i closed the door and  immediately called his number to confirm but he didnt picked up call, i  assumed he would be sleeping. came back to room and started watching t.v  and after not more than 5 minutes i heard like some one picked up all  the glass crockery and thrown on the floor. it was like bomb blast for me.  honestly i never expected this, i rushed to kitchen to see what happened  and to make me more scary every thing was on its place. i started  reciting Ayat-UL-Kursi and other Surahs. again went to bedroom turned  off only tv not lights ( didnt had that much heart at the time) and went  to bed. my forehead was full of sweat. later (may be a hour) i went  asleep. next day when i waked up, to my surprise lights were off.\nwell  it was my first experience with jinns or ghaybat or supernaturals.  after first night they didnt disturbed for almost a month. after some time at  night (worst night) when i was in bed and electricity was gone i heard  voice of my fiancee calling my name in a very charming way from window ( they were closed) i clearly felt sweat on my whole body and and a chilled sensation in my back bone. i started reciting Ayat-UL-Kursi and that voice stoped. when i am writing these lines i am feeling the same sensation :whistle:. i went asleep and in the middle of sleep i heard my fiancee is screaming and calling me for help like some one is pressing the neck i jumped up from the bed and wishing to go outside but at the moment my mind clicked and i remembered once an Aalim said never focus on a voice of a person which you are not expecting to be present there, again i started reciting Ayat-UL-Kursi and other Wazayef and the screaming stoped. at that night i didnt slept again. after dawn i called watch man to come immediately. when he came i told him every thing and he just smiled said get fresh we discuss it later few minutes. when i was having break fast he said you proved to be a strong man because you experienced worst events of this house and still you spent whole night, further he said that these JINNS doesnt harm only scare people inside house and previosly 3 watchmen left house just because of knocking the door and founding no one out side. i decided not to leave the house and in next 2 years i experienced many strange things happened to me like turning off of lights while switchs and outside lights are still on, disappearing of pens, books even towels from their specific location and founding them in other rooms. but then i learnt not to listen any voice and not to focus any thing and i managed it for whole 2 years. never heard such voices again thank god.\n\nHere my story ends and every letter is true and every one is free to agree or disagree.

I''ve never had the privilege of hunting in mountainous terrains, so when you mentioned inclines I only thought about the little hills that I''ve experienced here, very narrow minded of me. The scenario you presented is actually very interesting, and makes for challenging shooting indeed!  It''s because shooting on level ground (usually where we zero our scopes) there''s actually [I]more[/I] gravity acting on the bullet, than shooting up or downhill. Therefore at an incline, the bullet travels in a flatter arc and as you described, results in a higher point of impact. Shooting for accuracy in those situations involves shooting the "corrected for gravity distance to target",  instead of the "sloped distance to target" which is the straight line or walking distance to the target. \n[URL=http://s1277.photobucket.com/user/thegrossmaster/media/IMG_20140806_20080_edit_1407381016698_zpsyaiglnco.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1277.photobucket.com/albums/y489/thegrossmaster/IMG_20140806_20080_edit_1407381016698_zpsyaiglnco.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\nSince the "sloped distance" is further, you hold higher than necessary.

It literally is just a rubber tube, like from a bicycle tire. They do have finger grooves, but since they go over the stock grips, it will be fatter. The material is great, just like the model specific Hogues, but the way they fit and how they''re just slipped on like a sock, it just doesn''t feel proper to me.

Engagements are realistic too. None of this Call of duty over hyped action stuff. Real combat is thinking with your head and lobbing shots at 200-400m away with rifles. It also has a huge mod base, people are making mods , enhancements, new missions and stuff for it all the time. \n\nLearning curve is heavy though. you will be absolute trash for the first week or two before you get the hang of it.

(616011, ' Remember, we''re not discussing whether you''d choose AK or AR. The topic is DI AR or piston AR...\nWas your "gas tube" really blocked with dirt? If it is, you''re pretty screwed. \nSo what I think your point is (correct me if I''m wrong), is that with a piston, the rifle will run cleaner. Which is a reasonable argument. When M16 were first issued in Vietnam, there was an issue of fouling. But it was determined that inappropriate powder was used in the ammo. It was stick powder from the old 30-06 days, and when they switched to ball powder and issued proper maintenance instructions, that issue was pretty much alleviated.\n\nNonetheless, dirt/fouling comes from the ammo, so the same amount of dirt will be created whether that ammo is ignited by a piston gun or a DI gun. The issue is, where will the dirt go. True, in a DI gun, it gets blown all over bolt/carrier area. But with a piston gun, it stays in the piston area. If you''re worried about the "gas tube" getting blocked, think about the "gas port" which is a much smaller opening than the tube. Furthermore, the port is right where the piston is, exactly where a piston gun will accumulate dirt.\n\nTherefore, I think the issue of fouling is a write off. If you''re really relying on a rifle to save your life, I would think its reasonable to assume one would maintain it properly (at least keep it clean). Along with the fact that there''s just as much dirt in either gun, only difference is whether it''s in the front or in the back.\n\nPlease comment or question anything thats said guys, this is a great topic of discussion for AR enthusiasts!', ''),

(616029, ' Here''s a recap of a post I made earlier regarding the piston or direct impingement topic...\nAccuracy? Advantage DI. Less reciprocating mass and free floated barrel, without a heavy piston system attached. \nWeight? Advantage DI. All things being equal (same materials/accessories) DI guns are lighter.\nEfficiency? Advantage DI. Simpler system with fewer parts.  \nParts? Advantage DI. All piston driven systems on the market are proprietary systems while DI''s are standardized, allowing interchangability of parts between brands and models.\nLongevity? Advantage DI. Piston guns suffer from issues of bolt dive and cam pin gouging.\nTrack record? Advantage DI. Uninterrupted military service for over 50 years.\nSuppressed fire? Advantage DI. Piston guns don''t suppress as well due to venting of gasses at the port, and they also run hotter.\n\nAnyways, that''s why I take the DI side when it comes to AR''s, although I''m sure PDS proponents will have their reasons too.

It''s more efficient on fuel, creates more power, and runs cleaner. Carberetion could no longer compete. But PDS is not new technology that leaves the performance of DI guns in the stone age. So why is it only now, all these companies are making piston kits. It''s great to try new things, but I stand by my assertion that AR conversions are a fad.

And getting rid of the ''rock an roll option''  \nA local barrel could have been arranged for around 25k. But was not sure it would do any good.\n\nI will try and get some pics. Because.. heck its a pretty affordable .222 by Karachi standards (once it has been ''bleached ) and post em here. If a fresh barrel could be procured. I might actually get it transferred to my license.[/QUOTE]\nED Bro, a local 222 pipe is 5 grand here in my city.', ''),
(616057, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;453879]I also must reiterate, I don''t know it all either, and I''m not trying to say I know what''s better for you, or convince you to buy one gun over another. But I do like talking about guns, so just to continue the conversation...\n\nThe thing is, I wasn''t discussing whether an AK, or HK is a better gun than an AR. The point of contention [I]specifically,[/I] is if you took a standard AR, and made it run on a piston, what would the merits be compared to the original gun.\nTo use your example, if you took an ''82 Toyota AE86, replaced its carburetor with the fuel rail, injectors, and fuel pump out of a 1991 Volkswagen Golf. What are the merits of the modified system, or did you just make a more complicated, less reliable car?\n \nRegardless, FI was ground breaking technology that offered very significant advantages. It''s more efficient on fuel, creates more power, and runs cleaner. Carberetion could no longer compete. But PDS is not new technology that leaves the performance of DI guns in the stone age. So why is it only now, all these companies are making piston kits. It''s great to try new things, but I stand by my assertion that AR conversions are a fad. I will keep buying DI AR''s and they will keep making them, because PDS AR''s do not offer any advantages that would wipe them off the market. Try buying a new car now with dual Webbers :)[/QUOTE]\n\n\nI agree with nearly everything you mentioned. The simpler the better, fewer instances of things going wrong. Replacing a naturally carbureted car with just a fuel injection system is a can of worms I would not want to open but I would replace after market brake calipers or a an upgrade turbo kit.\nNow I can''t really say much about how complicated a piston mod is since I haven''t done it myself, so I''ll reserve comment until I have gone through the experience myself.\ni have heard hk416 has very minor upgrades from an m4, main one being the piston system, again this is all hearsay as I don''t have experience on either platform.', ''),

Brother i am more kind of amused seeing you target rather than being amazed.. I just cant up make myself to believe on this.. I am a shooter at LRC (lahore rifle club)..

And i know what it really is to practically shoot at 25 meters from a competition grade handgun like CZ Tactical sports.. Cz tactical sports is a pistol with built in competition features for precision shooting.. Single action only trigger weighing 0.8 to 1.5 pounds only and does not require any tasbeeh kind of techniques you have mentioned to smoothen up the trigger.. Its made for the purpose of precision shooting. What i mean by saying all this is that if a professional shooter or a national champion shows this kind of result at 25 meters with a competition pistol like CZ TS or Sig Sauer X6, believe me it would be his best targets and winning shots.. No offence janab, but this is simply not believable for a practical precision shooter.. And yes... You have written that you shot double taps... Can u plz explain this in practical terms of precision shooting?? At 25 meters you shot  a double tap with china made sig clone in 7.62*25 cal pistol and your shots landed on 9. And 4 of your shots landed on 10 making a kind of one tear hole. This is nearly impossible for a bare hand to acheive this accuracy from a high grade competition pistol in precision shooting. And can you plz explain the logic of double tap in precision shooting at 25 meters????? If you really wish to prove that you are true to your display name (sniper), then plz post a video showing this very results. Otherwise whole of your post does not have any logical means. And yes..

You posted that "liar" thing and then just edited it.. I never called anyone a liar.. I think you need to re edit your post again. Secondly brother for your kind information, no precision shooting is ever performed on a A4 size paper or i must say half A4 paper like in this case.. And no 25 meter precision shooting is performed on steel plates whether they are smaller or larger than A4 paper in a professional precision marksmanship.. That is a very different kind of shooting drills in which steel plates are shot. Its usually idpa type or defensive type shooting drills at 5 to 15 meters at most. 25 meter shooting comes under criteria of national championship precision shooting. And in that proper standard size targets are used of size 10.5 x 10.5 inch. So i hope now you are getting my point.. I have never said that mr. Sniper is a liar or any such word, but the only thing i am saying is that its apparently illogical and unbelievable.. Now its up to you that in what way to take these words.. A lie blame or a compliment.. Its up to you.. And definately mr. Sniper can turn this into a compliment at large by showing and proving that he has actually done that at 25 meters. I tell you what it takes to shoot this kind of results at 25 meters. Sir hitting a plate or a target even at 200 yards is totally a different thing.. Hickok45 also sometimes hit a gong plate at 200 yards by firing couple of rounds at it.. See being able to hit something often at such distanace is one thing but making a tight group at long distance such as 25-50 meters is another very different story.. To make a one or half inch group at 25 meters consistantly you need extra ordinary practice, skills and a high end competition grade handgun preferably with an adjustable sight. So with a new comer handgun like px3 showing that type of result is apparently not acceptable to mind.. Especially with a quote that double tap has also beed fired deliberately during that 25 meter shooting at the same tight group target..

I found it brandnew in a very old gun shop in lahore. Paid 35k for it.. Its kind of classic coz it is very old production with a very old off white card board box.. Its a direct copy S&W .22 revolver.. ( i cant remember that S&W .22 model number for now) i read in an article that these old style taurus revolvers with wooden grip and golden taurus emblem were the early productions back then S&W sold its revolvers manufacturing plant to taurus brazil..  It works fine.. I once had a problem with it.. I bought elley sport ammo.. It repeatedly misfired on double action but fired on single action.. I thought hammer spring is not making enough power on double action to fire it.. I really got worried.. Before doing anything thing with the gun i bought federal game shok and winchester high velocity 100 rds pack to test it with them. Both federal and winchester fired successfully on double action. I also fired many rounds rapidly on double action and it kept on firing.. So i got the idea that elley sport ammo i bought was faulty in a sense that it had hard primers for revolver to fire on double action.. Double action produces less power strike than single action coz on single action the hammer completely rests back end of the sear and releases with more force than double action which comes back little bit more than half way producing less strike power than single action.. I''ll post some good pics of my revolver with box shortly.', ''),

Dear sniper786, the thing is not about believing or not believing in you... I mean why should I or anyone would be intrested in whether you are a liar or a thuthful man. Neither I or anyone here ever said that we believe or dont believe on you.. Its nothing about "you".. Its all about that "tight group" you claimed to be shot at 25 meters with px3 including a "double tap" on the same tight group as you stated. So the thing is that that whole argument is about that tight group. You can read the previous comments in which we have stated that its apparently not believable for an "average human shooter" to see that kind of result from 25 meters with px3.. So lets stick to the target group thing and not try to be personally touchy about it. \n\nBeing said that, i would rather say that i never looked down to any shooter in means of degrading upon what kind of weapons they own. Why are you telling that you have this and you have that??? God knowing you maybe having missiles and tanks in your arsenal.. So what do I or anyone here has to do with that??? Dont try to impose false allegations please. I never said that you are down graded if you shot with px3 or tokarev or whatsoever handgun. \n\nAbout your trigger smoothing or dry firing technique to smoothen up the trigger, i would suggest you to do a better research on it and find a proper way to lighten up, polish up and smoothen your trigger pull.. Stating that i did "tasbeeh" 4000 times (showing religiousness) on the trigger by dry firing it is not a healthy idea i suppose. Do a research and you''ll find better ideas on how to polish the disconnecting point or sear of your pistol to make the trigger smooth. Sir plz dont assume or suppose my arrogance or humbleness from your thoughts.. What i replied to stranger1 was on a very different perspective. I explained in it for him.. You dont need to decide on that. \n\nOhhhhh... Ohhhh.... Wowwww.. What a challenge!... Relax.. Relax.. Keep all your high end snipers in your God knowing highly exotic arsenal store and read my comment AGAIN.... VERY CAREFULLY.. I didnt write that prove yourself by showing off your vast variety of snipers and start giving challenges  and inviting people on pakguns forum, I wrote and meant that its better if you post a video too with it so that everyone here can see your extraordinary skills on 25 meters and come to know how fastastic you are  and "how" you managed to stab the target with that tight group at 25 meters. Sir apart from that btw you dont need snipers to do that.. Like the results you shared, it seems you can perform at 500m from your px3 ... By the way janab its very surprising to see that you have a large range, also have a proper rangefinder, good camera and camera man too and yes not to forget huge collection of high end and good old rifles but how come you dont have proper standard size targets which are a standard size for shooting at 25-50 meters????? Anyhow God knowing how you are able to give such outstanding performances with those A4 paper targets from such long distances that you mentioned.   \n\nJanab I would not like to comment on your "caliph and our master" religious statement... I suggest you should keep your religious beliefs and thoughts to yourself. I dont want to get into any religious topic and argument here so plz refrain from such statements. \n\nThank you very much for showing hospitality. But I do not accept your invitation because you made a challenge out of misunderstanding my comment. Even apart from that we were never discussing rifles and 500m challenges on this thread.. So there is no point in your challenge statement at 500 meters. My comment was about your px3 tight group you made.. \n\nJust forget about gifting your rifle or me giving px3 and and 2000 rounds for torture test.. It will be a very pleasureful thing for us all if you just gift us a video here showing that how you can shoot such tight groups at (25meters) not inches, not foots. Its just that we all want because we are surprised at your wonderfull super human marksmanship skills of shooting double tap at 25 meters and making such tight groups. \n\nYou also dont mind janab.. Its just that you dont like my tone and I dont like your way of portraying things. And yes.. This is very much a humbly straight forward reply to your comments.', ''),

(616350, ' Let me emphasize I''m not taking sides. I find the subject at hand interesting, so I''d just like to offer a reasonable, unbiased and hopefully logical point of view, so my thoughts are this... First off, tone is really hard to interpret over Internet threads, I don''t think anyone had the intention to insult, so let''s not get defensive. Secondly, Khawaja bro never claimed to be a better shooter than anybody else,  with a handgun or otherwise.  So to challenge him with rifles just seems totally random. Third, his jab at the "Sniper" name was due to it being a self proclaimed title. On the other hand, Khawaja bro did not choose his name to imply prowess at anything, it was given to him. But lets just forget about that, its neither here nor there, and the etymology of our names or handles is totally irrelevant here. Finally lets be honest, fact of the matter is, Sniper effectively came out of nowhere, and just posted these amazing shots. With all due respect, forget about the "I just have to believe in myself" rhetoric, anyone who does that is probably expecting a reaction of some sorts... and that is exactly what happened. Look at it this way, if i just went over to a car forum and said, "check out this new Toyota I got guys, it can do 0-100 in 2.5 seconds" (not impossible, but unlikely). They''re not all just going to say, "wow thats cool, its so fast!". Those guys are going to say, "yeah right, prove it", and if I really had such a car, I wouldn''t say "I can prove it, just come race me on my private track in the mountains (if I had one:)). I would show them, and embarrass them, and shut them up. So let''s not make ridiculous wagers and challenges, why not just simply make the video.

(616407, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;454179]Let me emphasize I''m not taking sides. I find the subject at hand interesting, so I''d just like to offer a reasonable, unbiased and hopefully logical point of view, so my thoughts are this... First off, tone is really hard to interpret over Internet threads, I don''t think anyone had the intention to insult, so let''s not get defensive. Secondly, Khawaja bro never claimed to be a better shooter than anybody else,  with a handgun or otherwise.  So to challenge him with rifles just seems totally random. Third, his jab at the "Sniper" name was due to it being a self proclaimed title. On the other hand, Khawaja bro did not choose his name to imply prowess at anything, it was given to him. But lets just forget about that, its neither here nor there, and the etymology of our names or handles is totally irrelevant here. Finally lets be honest, fact of the matter is, Sniper effectively came out of nowhere, and just posted these amazing shots. With all due respect, forget about the "I just have to believe in myself" rhetoric, anyone who does that is probably expecting a reaction of some sorts... and that is exactly what happened. Look at it this way, if i just went over to a car forum and said, "check out this new Toyota I got guys, it can do 0-100 in 2.5 seconds" (not impossible, but unlikely). They''re not all just going to say, "wow thats cool, its so fast!". Those guys are going to say, "yeah right, prove it", and if I really had such a car, I wouldn''t say "I can prove it, just come race me on my private track in the mountains (if I had one:)). I would show them, and embarrass them, and shut them up. So let''s not make ridiculous wagers and challenges, why not just simply make the video. Do it for pride, for glory, for the education of others, for the fun of it! And above all else, do it to shut everybody up :D[/QUOTE]\n\nSir i dont know whether i should thank you on this reply or not because as you wrote this is not to take any one''s sides and totally unbiased. But one thing is for sure, this reply of yours and your unbiased and based on truth views created a whole new level of respect in my heart for you brother. I salute you for showing such courage and devotion to speak for truth. Now i dont feel like writing anything more on this topic as its already being very messy and even except that i have openly written everything to make my self very clear. But still if anyone here wishes to negate me or think that i did something really offensive then i suggest him to re read all my previous comments carefully and not just make up their minds and opinion just by having a thought that Khawaja Omar has a bad tone and he is making fuss here without any reason. Fudgepacker brother i really like your stance on that name thing written by sniper786.. I also found that very illogical to impose own religious views on someone. Apart of that, this forum discourages to make any kind  of religious statement here. And yes i said that "prove sniper thing" because of his title. Not because he''s really a sniper. But rather than to understand what i said he just blasted his religious views about my name. And yes brother.. I found his 500m challenge very funny though.. With all those exotic rifles he named.. Anyways brother now i dont have a need to repeat it all again as you very justly reported your views on the whole thing written by him. \nKeep it up Brother.. May God bless you.', ''),

(616565, 'Kumrat Valley: A Pictorial By Jibz It had been some time since I wanted to go to a Hill Station. Vacations are always looked forward to by me as I feel that it significantly helps in taking one’s mind off the deadly routine we go through every day. Every year I used to promise my kids and my better half but couldn''t materialize the same and evidently received a cold stare (you know from whom) every time someone used to narrate their story of a visit to certain hilly area.\n\nThis time it was more like a do or die situation and I couldn''t risk the shift from a [I]Cold Stare[/I] to something more violent in nature and thus had to choose to be at some hill station one way or the other. Fortunately, while planning where to go to, a very dear acquaintance suggested Kumrat Valley. We were told that it is one of the most beautiful places and we finally decided we will be making it to Kumrat.\n\nKumrat Valley is located in Upper Dir District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan on route through Sheringle. The estimated terrain elevation above sea level is about 2232 meters. Latitude: 35°31''0.01" and Longitude: 72°13''59.99"\n\nOn Friday morning, me and my gang (Two kids and their mom :P) were hell bent on reaching Kumrat. The route to Kumrat was as following. Peshawar-Chakdara- Timergara (Lowe Dir) - Upper Dir- Sheringle and finally Kumrat. We reached Sheringle in about 8 hours and we straightaway hit the river bank. The Kids played their hearts out in the cold icy water (brrrrrr..…it was really cold) and I took to shooting some snaps ([I]shooting[/I] with a camera actually; and please read it [I]Snaps[/I] Not [I]Snipes[/I], so some of you may sheath your unwarranted comments). :D.

The reason why I couldn''t go any further was the unavailability of a proper 4x4 vehicle and most of all an important meeting at office for which I had to be in Peshawar on Monday.

Theres jut something about a big hunk of slow moving lead :) When I got my 75, there were certain features that I wanted, and based on suggestions of everyone else, I went with the Shadow. Use of hollow points wasn''t an issue for me, but when I first got the gun, I was really impressed at how well polished the feed ramp is. Unless the issue is with the angle of the feed ramp, I wouldn''t worry too much about it. If you know the 97 is what you want, I''d go for it. You really can''t go too wrong with a CZ, plus hp bullets are not all created equal. If you have issues with one type, just try another brand with a different size/shape of opening. Not sure if you can find it, but Hornady makes a bullet called Critical Defense (far superior to Hydra Shoks IMHO) and they have a polymer insert that goes into the cavity. It really helps with reliable feeding, since theres no longer a gaping hole on the tip of the bullet to get caught up anywhere, and it almost guarantees expansion. \nAnyways, choosing what to get is always my favorite part about getting a new gun :)', ''),

Usually about 5-10%. sometimes 12. A better choice would be two gtx 770s in sli. You get redundancy, less heat problems, more performance,  according to you the 780 gives you a steady 50fps. a 770 itself would give you a 40. Slight overclocking would pretty much give you a 780 right there. then double it. Voila! instead of getting 50 fps, you get double that! ( a general rule is that for the first sli/crossfire card, you get 90% of the performace. then third is a 70% and fourth is a 50%.) so for the same price ( a 770 goes for about 300-350 USD, and the 780 for a nice shiny 550-600 dollars) you get double the performace, a backup in case one card dies, and enough fps to play smoothly even in 3d mode, ( as 2  frames need to be rendered, one for each eye, a 100 would become 50FPS. )\n\nSee what i mean? if you take your time, and research well, you can end up with a choice that is much more reliable. a setup like ^ will not need any upgrades for about 4 or so years, to max out every game on a 2k resolution, compared to a single card unit. \nI dont care how much money you spend, i care if you spent it WELL.', ''),

Looks can be very deceiving, as it is in this case (pretty good pun :)) where the smaller cartridge has much higher chamber pressures than the larger one. SAAMI ( Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute ) standards for the 9mm is 35,000 psi, but for the 45 ACP it''s only 21,000 psi. \n\nLooks are also deceiving with regards to how much gunpowder is inside each cartridge as well. You would think that a much larger case topped with a much larger bullet would have more powder, but... on average, a 230gr 45 and 115gr 9mm are both loaded with about 5gr''s of gunpowder. \n\nA little side note about ammo, since there are a couple threads floating around with people asking about reloading. I just want to emphasize that it''s not rocket science, but on the other hand it''s not something to be taken lightly. To clarify, when talking about ammunition,  the standard unit of measure is "gr" meaning "grains", and not "g/grams". For perspective, we all know 1kg is 1000 grams, alternatively, 1kg = 15,432 grains. It''s a very small unit of measure, and load data for how much powder goes into a cartridge is dictated down to 1/100th of a grain. So it''s a very unforgiving activity which requires extreme precision... not something to haphazardly experiment with!', ''),

(616779, ' Just want to shed some light on this issue because that''s a common misconception since a 45 is so much bigger than a 9mm. Looks can be very deceiving, as it is in this case (pretty good pun ) where the smaller cartridge has much higher chamber pressures than the larger one. SAAMI ( Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute ) standards for the 9mm is 35,000 psi, but for the 45 ACP it''s only 21,000 psi. \r\n\r\nLooks are also deceiving with regards to how much gunpowder is inside each cartridge as well. You would think that a much larger case topped with a much larger bullet would have more powder, but... on average, a 230gr 45 and 115gr 9mm are both loaded with about 5gr''s of gunpowder. \r\n\r\nA little side note about ammo, since there are a couple threads floating around with people asking about reloading. I just want to emphasize that it''s not rocket science, but on the other hand it''s not something to be taken lightly. To clarify, when talking about ammunition, the standard unit of measure is "gr" meaning "grains", and not "g/grams". For perspective, we all know 1kg is 1000 grams, alternatively, 1kg = 15,432 grains. It''s a very small unit of measure, and load data for how much powder goes into a cartridge is dictated down to 1/100th of a grain.

(616837, ' Thats an interesting question bro. To make such a comparison you have to shoot match grade ammo against match grade ammo, lock the gun in a vise, and the "bullet launcher" has to be the same for both calibers. But then how do you define accuracy? Tightest group at certain distance? Closest to point of aim from various distances? Maximum point blank range? In theory,  each has caliber has its issues. Like how the 45 has a much steeper trajectory. Not a problem if the gun is zeroed at a certain distance and you only shoot at that distance, but move the target by more than 15 meters and the 45''s point of impact will vary noticeably more than the 9. On the other hand, 9mm is traveling at supersonic speeds right out of the barrel. Only issue with that is, when it becomes subsonic, the resulting air turbulence affects the bulet''s accuracy.\nNow keep in mind that is really just splitting hairs. For all practical intents and purposes, I think they''re effectively quite equal.', ''),

(616858, ' Making a slingshot is easy and if made accurately, it is deadly accurate. The hardest part is finding the right V for it. The wooden thing on which you attach the rubber and the leather thing. They have the longest range of all improvised weapons as far as I have used, but they are kinda noisy too. About 1/2 of a non-silenced spring-piston airgun. It was my prized possession during childhood. In in my teen years I developed the extremely bad and damaging habbit of shooting/breaking street lights with it. Thankfully I got out of it after a year or two. I don''t have any with me now, but I do wish I had.\n\n[B]Slingshot [/B][B]Advantages[/B]\n1- Long range\n2- High accuracy\n3- Free ammo. You can shoot ball bearing balls, round pebbles, sun-dried adobe balls in it and all would give you the same accuracy.\n4- Easily concealable due to small size.\n5- Parts are readily available and repair takes only 15-20 mins.\n\n[B]Slingshot Disadvantages[/B]\n1- Finding the wooden V shaped base is a hard thing these days as slingshots aren''t as popular these days\n2- Despite all the advantages, it isn''t as "exotic" as the other things discussed here.\n\nBlowguns are incredibly easy to make. You only need a 4-5 feet long steel/aluminium pipe of 0.4-0.5 inches diameter and you''re good to go. They are very very addictive and estremely fun to shoot with. Highly accurate, but have a far lesser range (almost 1/2) of the slingshot. Ammo (darts) are cheap to build but take time and are a pain in the butt to build. One small error and your 3-4 mins effort goes down the drain. Plus, in case of sabotage missions (as espressed in the OP), the darts would stay in the target object and would yell out loud "It''s [B]him[/B]. That guy with the long pipe thingy!" Not too much fun outdoors, but small blowpipes (3 feet or so) are unparalleled for shooting in halls, galleries, roofs, lawns etc.\n[B]\nBlowgun Advantages[/B]\n1- The pipe itself is readily available anywhere and does not take any effort to make.\n2- Is very accurate.\n3- And silent.\n4- Best choice for indoors shooting.\n5- Does not attract any unwanted attraction from LEAs, police and all.\n6- You feel like a south american small bird hunter with it ;)\n\n[B]Blow[/B][B]gun Disadvantages[/B]\n1- The darts are a pain to make and each dart takes about 3-4 minutes to make at least. In the start, it would take you almost 5-6 mins to make one dart.\n2- Bad bad idea for covert operations like shooting off the lemons from neighbors'' lemon tree, as the darts would give it away :(\n\nWhen we talk of bows and arrows, we immediately think of the ones professionally (or at least made by the espert craftsmen) developed and available in the market. Fact is, in our area folks used very lightweight arrows (esplanation ahead) with bamboo bows. Nowadays kids interested in bows and arrows still use the same type of arrows, but the "bow" is made of a plastic pipe and the propelling power comes from a broad rubber band attached at one end. I will post a video someday. The arrows, which I mentioned, are simply made of reed sticks with a small, sharp head attached to them. The effective range is around 50 meters (birds and small game) while they fly to over 100 meters (losing their force and accuracy after 50 m). These also give a highly aesthetic feeling during shooting. I used them excessively at one point in my life, but then quit. Making the arrows is a pain.\n\n[B]Local Bow & Arrow Advantages[/B]\n1- Easy to make. Cost is even lesser than the slingshot and the blowpipe.\n2- Give you a very aesthetic feel.\n3- For covert operations, you can detach the arrowheads from the shaft (a reed stick) and carry them separately. Nobody would give a shyte to some stupid reed sticks. The "bow" (the rubber band thing) can be easily hidden anywhere.\n4- Completely silent.\n5- Have the highest damage potential where slingshots cannot be used.\n\n[B]Local [/B][B]Bow & Arrow Disadvantages[/B]\n\n1- It is very very hard to find straight reed sticks. Really. Trust me. It is amazing how hard it is to find one reed stick that goes straight for 2 feet.\n2- Arrowheads are slightly, though not excessively, hard to make. Not as much pain as the darts though.', ''),

(616862, ' .22LR is a very nasty little round, and in ''close range'' it can cause real havoc in the body as the bullet doesn''t stay just behind the entry point. It ricochets inside the body violently damaging tissue and anything soft that comes in it''s way, in the case of non-hollow points. It is nightmare for surgeons to operate to get the bullet out because the bullet pattern after entering the body is nothing like 9mm or other more conventional pistol calibers.', ''),

(616866, ' Verve, i know that its behaviour in flesh, but the problem is, its not as....\nwhats the word..\ni swear, if my english was better id use something else but here we go= reliable as a killing weapon. A .22 lr can kill, just like a fall down the stairs or a airgun can kill. possible, but dont bet on it, Yes, it can go through bone, but in the case of a unlucky shot, the 9mm will be better off.\n\n Lets say you pop they guy in 5 general places. In the arm and leg, hitting bone is hard, and both rounds will just blast right through. The wider wound channel doing more damage, hence 9mm win.chest and abdomen, Medically speaking the only "immediate incapacitation you will get is if you hit the spine. which is unlikely, but both rounds can do it. But if you miss, as usual, the 9mm will blast right through, and the .22 will maybe, be slightly offset by bone,and somehow manage to hit the spine.So a very unlikely spine hit vs guarenteed significant damage through and through? 9mm wins. In the head, as any youtube vid will show you, both will blow clean through bone. PLEASE dont give me any of that ( .22 bounces in skill BS. A hit to the brain is immidiate death/incapacitate  no matter what the caliber. If one side vs two sides are turned to mush, the opponenet will STILL DIE . both win. so the end score is 5-1\n\nboth 9mm and .22 lr are easy rounds to handle. hell, after starting on .22 lr, even petite women go ahead and choose the 9mm as their to-go round. \n\nKeeping in mind that you want to kill a opponent when firing in self defence. If you point a gun at someone, its to kill em. no "non-lethal shot" bullcrap here. \nthe 9mm is=\nthe same fps\nmildly more expensive\nmore reliable ( a .22 pistol, as all .22 pistols go, will have the occasional feeding and firing issue due to the rim of the cartridge. )\nguns (pistols, go for pretty much the same price)\nare more reliable as a offensive weapon.\nare better suited for less-then-ideal conditions ( wind, rain, thunderstorm, longer ranges, dusty environments ) \nIs more or less of a staple round. i mean, sure .22 is everywhere, but only for sporting. 9mm is EVERYWHERE, sporting, LEA, you name it. Its like what the .30 tokarev is to pakistan. \nmore rounds. .22lr weapons go upto 10 rounds max unless its a auto weapon, ( no autos in pak. ) but with 9mm we get a avg of 15-17+1 rounds to 33+1 rounds. \nIf you consider both as Hollow points, the 9mm will leave a much bigger wound channel. \n\nthe vitues of the .22lr are not many. \ncheaper ammo\nand the ability to cause bleeding in many small wound channels. \n\n\nThe guy in question, if he was a star shooter, he could of course perform 3 headshots with a .22 lr, just as he could with a 9mm. But the point is, in less then perfect conditions , lets say 2 head shots and a torso hit, a 9mm would leave the defendant with many more bullets in the mag, and even if the hit is in a non vital area, would cause more damage. Surely the man will not just stand there like a doofus and let himself internally bleed to death. he will flee, or shoot back. Now tell me, in that 10 second period after he gets hit, will a 1.3- 2cm hole bleed more or a .7-1 cm hole? \nForget about the surgions stories. We want the target to never even get to the surgeon at all. If surgeons go around saying oh so and so, .22 bounces around and is hard to remove, lets think why are there no such stories about 9mm, or .45? Because the robber never got the chance to get to the surgeon. \n\nYES the .22 lr is underestimated as a bullet. But this is a case of expecting the underdog to have superpowers. cars dont replace trucks. each have their own place. IF, you think that ( bouncing around) benefit is worth it, use something with a much higher chance of that happening. AKA bird/buckshot\n\nThe EMT fourms on the internet state the same thing. They say almost all .22 rounds are completely go though the body, and in some rare, incredible outrageous case, may bounce around. Mostly what they state is = "Small caliber bullets like the .22 will either barely hurt, or in extreme cases, kill you"\n\n\nEven for women, id hand em a .22 for the first 100 or so, and move em up to a 9mm/or a 38.special ''volver gun and tell em they can stay there or move up.\n\n\nSo my final words on the topic would be, \nDont "underestimate" or "overestimate" the power of our trusty .22lr', ''),

This topic is about Handguns not revolvers and i will tell you about most commonly used rounds around,\n each round has it own advantages and disadvantages\ni have chosen .22lr, 9mm, .40s&w, .357sig, 7.62x25tokarov and .45ACP\n\ni start with .22lr:     5/10\n.22lr is a great round to go specialy if you are new to guns and if you are a lady, week much to handle recoil, or you just want to train with less bang of money,\n.22lr is easily available in pakistani market you can buy darra made to high veolcity American rounds depending upon your budget, .22lr gives you less recoil so you can aim gun more precisely but here is one thing bro what you have to do of recoil if the bullet dosent make suffiecent wound , it dosent mean that .22lr is safe and it will not kill , belive me there is no other round that has killed more people than .22lr round simply becz some people underestimate it, but here is the condition in survival conditon you had to shot it in speed at multiple times because it doesnot makes bigger holes in body and thats why it is not a good stopping round other than if it hits head or chest right in to the heart , the handler had to shot it couple of times before eliminating the threat, you can buy local to imported rifles , revolvers and handguns for this round they are widely available throughout the pakistani market\n\n9mm:       8/10\n9mm is most widely availabe round there is no place on earth from where you cant get it, pistols in 9mm  alows you to carry more ammo in your magazine because of its compact disgn , it''s recoil is tolerable its cheap and it can save your life by eliminating threat quickly but practical results on human targets in military combats tell other story it does not has good stoping power you need multiple shots to put the bad guy down that is why it is being replaced as a standard military cartridge very quickly from rest of the world,\n\n.40s&w     7.5/10\nNo doubt it is a great round , it has good stopping power makes bigger wound has tolerable recoil (more than 9mm), it is a powerfull round but it comes with one big disadvantage it is not regularly avaiable in pak market and is costly too, and it does not allows user to carry much ammo in magazine since its a bigger round, for people with excellent target practice it is good way to go because they can hit vital spot with less missing targets which simply means with less ammo they can get the job done, but those who are new shooters need higher capacity magazines because there chances of missing targets is far more and nobody wants to waste all his ammo in such situation to soon and then stand like a dumb with your life in the hands of an  angry bad guy who is probably boiling with your attempt to kill him.\nto carry more ammo get some 9mm pistol, you can find many handguns for this chamber but they are far less in number than 9mm types but they are more in number than .357sig\n\n.357sig     8/10\nit is best Handgun round in my opinion, its trajactory is very straight simply it means that you can hit the spot at which you have aimed if you have aimed correctly, this alows this round to have long effective range than any other pistol round, many folks compare it with .40s&w and some with 9mm but it is actualy in between them it is just an over powered 9mm its bullet diameter is similar to 9mm but its case is of 40s&w with neck squeezed to fit bullet, it has best trajactory good stopping power since it can penetrate more than 9mm , but here are some disadvantages just like 40s&w it does not has bigger ammo capacity in normal magazines, very less pistols are available that are chambered in .357sig in pakistani market, so you don''t have much pistol choices for this round, glocks and sigsors have bigger price tags which are available in this chamber, big reason to worry for a budget buyer,\n\n7.62x25:     7/10\nHmm, Russian sounds deadly already???\nand yes it is, it is among the most lethal handgun rounds around ,it is still in use by pakistani police and some other countries though it is now largely replaced by 9mm but it doesnot means it is less lethal than 9mm, infact some professional ballistic results show it to be more lethal than 45ACP(at close range), because of bigger demand of 9mm round guns this round and its guns are vanishing from the international market but still in pakistan it is readily available in cheap price, one disadvantage of this round is that due to its bigger size it doesnot allows much ammo to be feeded in magazines and on standard you get like 7+1 or if lucky enough than 9 round magazines by far, big advantage is that the pistols which use this round are cheaper than any other pistols in the market from zastava to russian TT-tokarov, to norinco you name it all are

(616907, ' Sir i have used many different brands of oils for gun cleaning and lubricating..  But at the end i landed up with the same opinion.. For my Glock i use a fair quality demoisturant and penetrative spray. But that i use only to clean wipe off all the dirt residue. I use toothbrush to scrub wash all parts with spray and then i clean wipe off it dry with a soft cotton cloth. After that i use good quality mobil oil for lightly lubricating the slide rails and other parts a which frictions. Less than one drop and equally applying with finger, coating it with thin layer. I dont lubricate inner side of barrel. I just clean it off and leave it dry. And i dont use any oiling of firing pin. Last time i tried Singer oil for lightly lubricating. Singer oil is very thin oil used for lubricating parts of sewing machines by singer brand. I think its good quality white oil.. I found it very good.. That because its very thin and lightly lubricates the parts and has less tendency of attracting dirt or residue than thick motor oil..

All three  cars were together, till nueplex, my brother and others decided to stop  for movie tickets.  I was driving, my dad and Aunty were with me, as it was getting quite  late, was 1:10 am already, we decided to move on, leaving two cars  behind.  Okay, so the place I am talking about is next lane of nueplex, which  goes towards eithad. street was pitch dark, no street lights nothing,  all was good until we were almost half way on that road.  A new corolla came from behind, on full speed, I was on the fast lane,  considering they were in a rush, I gave them space, instead of moving  on, they slowed their car, and came right next to my driving side,  slowing their speed, man ( who was around 30 plus years old wearing  shalwar kameez) rolled down his window trying to say something, which I  didn''t understand at first, but when I looked closely, he had a gun with  silencer, in his hand, and was telling me to stop, straightaway. I put  my foot on the accelerator hard, decided not to stop, he fired on the  car, on my door. I left them behind me, and since the road is narrow,  they were trying hard to over take the car, but I tried not to give any  space to them, until a point came, where was a lane going on the left,  there they came ahead us, and stopped the car in front of ours. The man  from the back seat got off, proceeding towards us. I don''t know how, but  Allah swt, gave me the strength, and courage to do it. I decided not to  give up, put the car in the reverse gear on full speed, the man got  shocked, and ran back to sit in his car. I went into that lane on left  which came before, it was dark, all dark nothing could be seen, I turned  off the cars lights so that they cannot trace us, I don''t know how in  that darkness, Allah swt showed me the way, to get out from there, and  escape, leaving them behind. Else there was no hope, at all.  Khair the whole purpose of writing this is that, there were 5 men in  that car with guns, and Allah knows what their intentions were. I would  have stopped and not taken the risk, if they were on bikes, and simple  mobile snatchers. But when I saw their faces, It looked different,  worse. I don''t want to say the feelings I got, worst endless  possiblities I can think of. They could be there for kidnapping or Allah  knows what.  Later, I got to know that there had been a lot of kidnapping happening  in that area, and they are targeting female drivers, and families.  I would not have written this, but I just realised, that there are night  shows happening at nueplex, and mostly couples and families, go to  those shows, and am sure many take that route. Please AVOID !!  What I went through, I don''t want anyone else to go through it. Chase  lasted for 10 minutes. Those were the worst 10 minutes of our lives, may  Allah doesn''t make anyone else go through it. P.S those who think I should have stopped the car, and not tried to run  away please ignore such comments! I agree there was risk involved in  this, but I did what I felt was right, in that moment, and Allah guided  me, and dua''as of elders saved us.  If I would have stopped the car, it would have been a lot worse, and God  forbid, but I might not have been there to write this. And at that  moment getting out of there, taking my family out of that situation  securely was my priority."[/QUOTE]', ''),

It''s for durability in military use, so that the ammo won''t dent or deform as easily during transport, when dropped, stepped on, etc. \n\nThere are bigger differences between the guns themselves than the cartridges, where a 556 chamber will have a larger throat. [I]However, [/I]with either rifle, both cartridges will go into battery just fine. \n\nTechnically, shooting 556 out of a 223 rifle creates unsafe conditions according to SAAMI, because a hotter round in a chamber with a smaller throat could lead to excess pressures. [I]However[/I], many seasoned shooters have been doing so for years with no ill effect.\n\nSo, the debate/disagreement comes from one side arguing the theory and technicalities, while other guys speak based on their experience and what is commonly practiced. Personally, if I knew from the beginning I would be using both calibers regularly, I would just buy the rifle with a 556 chamber. [I]However[/I], if I had a 223 rifle, I wouldn''t hesitate to feed it the odd 556.\n[URL=http://s1277.photobucket.com/user/thegrossmaster/media/IMG_20140814_19164_edit_1408069022711_zps14a8p8vq.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1277.photobucket.com/albums/y489/thegrossmaster/IMG_20140814_19164_edit_1408069022711_zps14a8p8vq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),

(617002, ' As you guys probably know by now, I have an opinion on just about everything when it comes to guns... so why should Dan Wesson be an exception :lol:\n\n\nFirst of all, no disrespect to current owners and fans, but I never liked DW 1911''s. I understand if the market lacks alternatives, but if there was a choice, I would never have one. Aside from the few I''ve seen here on PG, I don''t even know anyone who owns one, and if one just fell in my lap, I would honestly just sell it without even shooting it. Here''s my issue: I see their jumping on the 1911 bandwagon merely as a desperate attempt to save the company from financial distress. They did not set out with the sole purpose of trying to make the best 1911, unlike a "real" top tier 1911 manufacturer. Revolvers had always been their specialty, it was their foundation, and their history; yet they totally lost focus and all but gave up on that part of the business. A horrible decision if you ask me, but that was just one of many bad decisions that led to the company going bankrupt; not once... but twice, and almost a third time! That is why CZUSA came along bought them out. With a record like that, it''s hard enough just to have respect for the company, to have confidence in the products they build is beyond me. Anyways, IMHO there are a lot of better 1911''s for the same or even less money, and instead of worrying about no more DW''s, I think dealers in Pak should focus on getting brands like Springfield, Ruger, and Sig Sauer. If Glocks are making their way over, I don''t see why that couldn''t be possible.\nThe way I see it, just like in plane rides, there are 4 levels in the 1911 world. These are my favorites in each class:\nEconomy - Norinco\nBusiness - Remington\nFirst Class - Kimber\nPrivate Jet - Nighthawk\n\nAs always, just my $0.02... what''s yours?\n:)', ''),

(617027, 'A Road Trip to Chitral :) After going through Jibz''s thread on Kurmat Valley, i feel i should also share my road trip here :) \n[COLOR=#555555]\n[/COLOR]On Thursday 19 June, 2014 I called My friend Asad Ali&#65279; to make a plan for a short trip up North, on Friday evening we finalized a plan to visit Shogran and Siri Paye. To our pleasure, Zohaib Akram&#65279; also joined us for the trip. We left Pindi on Saturday morning at 0930 hrs on my Suzuki Khyber, upon reaching Hasan Abdal we changed our destination and instead of turning towards Abbottabad we got on M1 from Burhan and selected Chitral as our destination. Then started a looooooong journey, full of fun, jokes, pictures, zillions of potholes, stones etc :) after getting off from the M-1 at Rashakai, we headed for Dir, via Malakand, Batkhela, Chakdara and Timergara. We stopped for Lunch at Timergara and ate a traditional Chicken Karahi cooked in charbi. We arrived at Dir later in the evening and stopped there for about 20-25 minutes and then resumed our journey. At Dir we were told by a few people that we wouldn''t be able to make it to Chitral on the khyber, even then we continued our journey undeterred :) After a little while the metalled road finished and so began the perilous journey, for about a good 5 hours the car was driven on a horrible jeep-able track. This patch is no doubt a nightmare for cars, the only cars we saw plying on the route were Non Custom Paid (NCP) Toyota Corolla station wagons (models 1987-1994), the rest were 4x4s, trucks and coasters. We reached the Lowari Tunnel at about 2015 hrs and were told that the tunnel is closed for traffic owing to ongoing drilling in the tunnel. But we requested the Chitral Scouts men deployed at the tunnel and they were kind enough to entertain our request, we were allowed to use the 9 KM tunnel which saved us almost 1.5 hours.  We travelled, travelled and travelled and travelled for ages through Darosh, Kesu and reached Chitral city at 0100 hrs on Sunday. We wanted to visit Shandur but couldn’t as it was the last day of the festival and it wasn’t possible to reach Shandur prior to the closing ceremony, so we hired a NCP corolla station wagon and headed for Kalash (Bamborat) aka Kafiristan, spent almost an entire day wandering here and there looking at the sceneries, taking loads n loads of pictures. Learnt a lot about the culture of the Kalashi people. In the evening we returned back to the city loitered about and had a tea break in the lawn of Chitral Scouts HQ Officers'' Mess. On Monday we did a little shopping and visited Chitral Gol National Park near Haart. There is an old palace situated on the top which was closed but we managed taking a few pics with its exterior and enjoyed the beauty of nature from that top. The track towards this point was quite dangerous and tricky. In the evening we returned to the city, enjoyed some time on the bank of Chitral river and headed back to the Mess. The following morning i.e Tuesday we started for pindi at about 0600 hrs. On reaching the lowari tunnel we again requested for passage through the tunnel but we weren''t allowed as blasting was in process, so we had to come via Lowari Top, which was a blessing in disguise, otherwise we would have missed the awesome scenic beauty of the area. On a couple of places on the track water flows from the mountain and crosses the track. At one such place while attempting to cross the water the car got stuck in the rocks. The water level was quite high and in no time the water started coming in the car’s cabin, I then realized how the passengers of titanic must have felt when it was sinking :P My friends immediately jumped out of the windows and started to push the car. The water in the car had reached to the level of the pedals, the accelerator, clutch and brake were now under water L and we could see a few things (like my hand sanitizer) floating in the cabin. But my faithful car didn’t let us down and the engine kept on roaring despite the water in its silencer. We got the car out of the water and spent the next half hour getting the water out of the car. We literally had to use a mug (improvised from an engine oil bottle) to get the water out of the car. This was the only hiccup in our journey, the journey has further strengthened the bond my car and I share. We reached Pindi at about quarter past 9. It was one memorable trip to say the least J . Now its time for me to shut up and the pictures to start talking. \n[COLOR=#555555]\n\n\nEnroute to Dir \n[/COLOR][IMG][URL="http://s1281.photobucket.com/user/FrazNawaz/media/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0264_zpsa10638f7.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a508/FrazNawaz/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0264_zpsa10638f7.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\n\n\nA broken suspension bridge near Dir\n\n[IMG][URL="http://s1281.photobucket.com/user/FrazNawaz/media/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0279_zps97b0d7ec.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a508/FrazNawaz/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0279_zps97b0d7ec.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\n\nLeaving Dir \n[IMG][URL="http://s1281.photobucket.com/user/FrazNawaz/media/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0284_zpsf0d84305.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a508/FrazNawaz/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0284_zpsf0d84305.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\n\nA waterfall, after Dir\n\n[IMG][URL="http://s1281.photobucket.com/user/FrazNawaz/media/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0287_zps85b23618.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a508/FrazNawaz/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0287_zps85b23618.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\n\n\nThe three musketeers :)\n[IMG]http://s1281.photobucket.com/user/FrazNawaz/media/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0304_zpsd5ddde9a.jpg.html?sort=3&o=34[/IMG][IMG][URL="http://s1281.photobucket.com/user/FrazNawaz/media/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0299_zps5e4385fe.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a508/FrazNawaz/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0299_zps5e4385fe.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]\n\n[IMG][URL="http://s1281.photobucket.com/user/FrazNawaz/media/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0304_zpsd5ddde9a.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a508/FrazNawaz/A Road Trip to Chitral/DSC_0304_zpsd5ddde9a.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/IMG]', ''),

(617043, 'Wd-40 I saw a post on FB by RON ENGLISH Founder & Managing Editor at [URL="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Editor-SalvationLinkscom/163611960496526?ref=br_rs"]Editor, SalvationLinks.com[/URL]. He shared some funny things about WD-40. \n\nWhat Is The Main Ingredient of WD-40?\n Before you read to the end, does anybody know what the main ingredient of WD-40?\n No Cheating.....\n WD-40 ~      Who knew!\n I had a neighbour who bought a new pickup.\n I got up very early one Sunday morning and saw that someone had spray\n painted red all around the sides of this beige truck (for some unknown\n reason).\n I went over, woke him up, and told him the bad news.\n He was very upset and was trying to figure out what to do   ....\n probably nothing until Monday morning, since nothing was open.\n Another neighbour came out and told him to get his WD-40 and clean it off.\n It removed the unwanted paint beautifully and did not harm his paint\n job that was on the truck. I was impressed!\n WD-40 who knew?\n "Water Displacement #40".\n The product began from a search for a rust preventative solvent and\n degreaser to protect missile parts.\n WD-40 was created in 1953, by three technicians at the San Diego\n Rocket Chemical Company.\n Its name comes from the project that was to find a ''Water\n Displacement'' Compound.\n They were finally successful for a formulation, with their fortieth\n attempt, thus  WD-40.  The ''Convair Company'' bought it in bulk to\n protect their atlas missile parts.\n Ken East (one of the original founders) says there is nothing in WD-40\n that would hurt you.\n When you read the ''shower door'' part, try it.   It''s the first thing\n that has ever cleaned that spotty shower door.  If yours is plastic,\n it works just as well as on glass.  It''s a miracle!\n Then try it on your stove-top.\n It''s now  shinier than it''s ever been.\n You''ll be amazed.\n WD-40 Uses:\n 1.      Protects silver from tarnishing.\n 2.      Removes road tar and grime from cars.\n 3.      Cleans and lubricates guitar strings.\n 4.      Gives floor that ''just-waxed'' sheen without making them slippery.\n 5.      Keeps the flies off of Cows, Horses, and other Farm Critters.\n 6.      Restores and cleans chalkboards.\n 7.      Removes lipstick stains.\n 8.      Loosens stubborn zippers.\n 9.      Untangles jewellery chains.\n 10.    Removes stains from stainless steel sinks.\n 11.    Removes dirt and grime from the barbecue grill.\n 12.    Keeps ceramic/terracotta garden pots from oxidising.\n 13.    Removes tomato stains from clothing.\n 14.    Keeps glass shower doors free of water spots.\n 15.    Camouflages scratches in ceramic and marble floors.\n 16.    Keeps scissors working smoothly.\n 17.    Lubricates noisy door hinges on both home and vehicles doors.\n 18.    It removes that nasty tar and scuff marks from the kitchen\n flooring. It doesn''t seem to harm the finish and you won''t have to\n scrub nearly as hard to get them off.  Just remember to open some\n windows if you have a lot of marks.\n 19.    Remove those nasty bug guts that will eat away the finish\n on your car if not removed quickly!\n 20.    Gives a children''s playground gym slide a shine for a super fast slide.\n 21.    Lubricates gearshift and mower deck lever for ease of handling on\n riding mowers.\n 22.    Rids kids rocking chair and swings of squeaky noises.\n 23.    Lubricates tracks in sticking home windows and makes them easier to open.\n 24.    Spraying an umbrella stem makes it easier to open and close.\n 25.    Restores and cleans padded leather dashboards in vehicles, as well\n as vinyl bumpers.\n 26.    Restores and cleans roof racks on vehicles.\n 27.    Lubricates and stops squeaks in electric fans.\n 28.    Lubricates wheel sprockets on tricycles, wagons and bicycles for\n easy handling.\n 29.    Lubricates fan belts on washers and dryers and keeps them running smoothly.\n 30.    Keeps rust from forming on saws and saw blades, and other tools.\n 31.    Removes grease splatters from stove-tops.\n 32.    Keeps bathroom mirror from fogging.\n 33.    Lubricates prosthetic limbs.\n 34.    Keeps pigeons off the balcony (they hate the smell).\n 35.    Removes all traces of duct tape.\n 36.    Folks even spray it on their arms, hands, and knees to relieve\n arthritis pain.\n 37.    Florida ''s favourite use is: ''cleans and removes love bugs from\n grills and  bumpers.''\n 38.    The favourite use in the state of New York , it protects the Statue\n of Liberty from the elements.\n 39.    WD-40 attracts fish. Spray a little on live bait or lures and you\n will be catching the big one in no time. Also, it''s a lot cheaper than\n the chemical attractants that are made for just that purpose.   Keep\n in mind though, using some chemical laced baits or lures for fishing\n are not allowed in some states.\n 40.    Use it for fire ant bites. It takes the sting away immediately and\n stops the itch.\n 41.    It is great for removing crayon from walls. Spray it on the marks\n and wipe with a clean rag.\n 42.    Also, if you''ve discovered that your teenage daughter has washed\n and dried a tube of lipstick with a load of laundry, saturate the\n lipstick spots with WD-40 and rewash. Presto! The lipstick is gone!\n 43.    If you spray it inside a wet distributor cap, it will displace the\n moisture, allowing the engine to start.\n                 My discovery,        Ants don''t like it..................\n \n P.S.\n As for that Basic, Main Ingredient.......\n Well.... it''s FISH OIL....\n Now This Is Definitely Worth SHARING!!\n \n\n\n\n[URL="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=775822679095857&set=a.163588713652593.39848.100000043970594&type=1&relevant_count=1"][IMG]https://scontent-a-mxp.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/t1.0-9/10155822_775822679095857_4978153840522986953_n.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[/URL]', ''),

I understand if the market lacks alternatives, but if there was a choice, I would never have one. Aside from the few I''ve seen here on PG, I don''t even know anyone who owns one, and if one just fell in my lap, I would honestly just sell it without even shooting it. Here''s my issue: I see their jumping on the 1911 bandwagon merely as a desperate attempt to save the company from financial distress. They did not set out with the sole purpose of trying to make the best 1911, unlike a "real" top tier 1911 manufacturer. Revolvers had always been their specialty, it was their foundation, and their history; yet they totally lost focus and all but gave up on that part of the business. A horrible decision if you ask me, but that was just one of many bad decisions that led to the company going bankrupt; not once... but twice, and almost a third time! That is why CZUSA came along bought them out. With a record like that, it''s hard enough just to have respect for the company, to have confidence in the products they build is beyond me. Anyways, IMHO there are a lot of better 1911''s for the same or even less money, and instead of worrying about no more DW''s, I think dealers in Pak should focus on getting brands like Springfield, Ruger, and Sig Sauer. If Glocks are making their way over, I don''t see why that couldn''t be possible.\r\nThe way I see it, just like in plane rides, there are 4 levels in the 1911 world. These are my favorites in each class:\r\nEconomy - Norinco\r\nBusiness - Remington\r\nFirst Class - Kimber\r\nPrivate Jet - Nighthawk\r\n\r\nAs always, just my $0.02... what''s yours?\r\n:)[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nyou have a problem with most of the guns :) kidding, no offense intended\r\n\r\nnow my question is why would you sell a gun without even testing it? :) i mean they may be going through financial problems but that doesnt mean that they manufacture sub standard guns\r\n\r\nJust my Rs. 0.02 :)', ''),

Barrel wear occurs mostly during continuous rapid fire with extremely high temperates, and that is how they come up with a figure, like in those endurance tests in videos. If you [B]continuously[/B] shoot[B] as fast as you can[/B], the barrel [B]may[/B] need replacing after 6000 rounds. But, that is not how people shoot. When you go to the range, do you load up 10 mags, empty them all as fast as you can, then pack it up. Even if you shot 500 rounds every session, it''s not going to be continuous rapid fire. Sure you might do a mag dump every now and then, but you''ll probably fire off a couple rounds, check your group, fire some more, reload your mags, put up a new target... you know, like "normal" people :lol: Amyways, that''s why most manufacturers don''t even state a "barrel life", it''s almost impossible to determine, and most people won''t wear out a barrel in their life time anyways.

(617137, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;454830]As you guys probably know by now, I have an opinion on just about everything when it comes to guns... so why should Dan Wesson be an exception :lol:\n\n\nFirst of all, no disrespect to current owners and fans, but I never liked DW 1911''s. I understand if the market lacks alternatives, but if there was a choice, I would never have one. Aside from the few I''ve seen here on PG, I don''t even know anyone who owns one, and if one just fell in my lap, I would honestly just sell it without even shooting it. Here''s my issue: I see their jumping on the 1911 bandwagon merely as a desperate attempt to save the company from financial distress. They did not set out with the sole purpose of trying to make the best 1911, unlike a "real" top tier 1911 manufacturer. Revolvers had always been their specialty, it was their foundation, and their history; yet they totally lost focus and all but gave up on that part of the business. A horrible decision if you ask me, but that was just one of many bad decisions that led to the company going bankrupt; not once... but twice, and almost a third time! That is why CZUSA came along bought them out. With a record like that, it''s hard enough just to have respect for the company, to have confidence in the products they build is beyond me. Anyways, IMHO there are a lot of better 1911''s for the same or even less money, and instead of worrying about no more DW''s, I think dealers in Pak should focus on getting brands like Springfield, Ruger, and Sig Sauer. If Glocks are making their way over, I don''t see why that couldn''t be possible.\nThe way I see it, just like in plane rides, there are 4 levels in the 1911 world. These are my favorites in each class:\nEconomy - Norinco\nBusiness - Remington\nFirst Class - Kimber\nPrivate Jet - Nighthawk\n\nAs always, just my $0.02... what''s yours?\n:)[/QUOTE]\n\nAnd where do you rate Colt and Taurus?', ''),

(617183, 'PX-3 (7.62x25)- Finally Reviewed With Range Report If I reckon correctly, it was in May 2014, when someone on the forum announced that PX-3 (7.62x25), a Chinese semi-auto handgun has reached our shores. This news was received by many with enthusiasm and by others with a mixed reaction. The fact remains that seldom does an opportunity arises when a manufacturer goes back to their drawing board and brings out a handgun which is destined to be fed obsolete ammo and that’s what we had in the new PX-3.\nI also remember that among other comments about the PX-3, the most memorable were, its not good; It looks nice; it’s a bad copy of Sig; it’s almost the same as NP22 or for that reason even HP77B (with the exception of the rail); it won’t bear the pressure of a 7.62x25; it will not be accurate and what not and what not. During our conversations, Aquarius sir and myself did discuss this handgun many a times but talking about a gun and then letting it talk its heart out on a range are two very different things. So we decided that it was time to put PX-3 under scrutiny and no better place for doing that other than on a shooting range. Colt1911 was kind enough to join us and unfortunately Dr Gilani couldn’t make it. We missed you dearly, Dr Gilani sir.\nOn 14[SUP]th[/SUP] August when the nation was celebrating the Independence Day; supporters of two political parties were marching in rallies; Peshawar chapter of PG was hell bent on testing PX-3 at the most humid possible hours of the day. Ufff it was hot and humid.. Marr dita, simply. So here is our take.\n \n[B][U]FEW COMMENTS ON PX-3''s LOOKS[/U][/B]\nAlthough PX-3 is completely based on NP22 platform (which itself is based on Sig), the most innovative thing about it is its caliber. But wait, could its caliber be the ONLY most innovative thing about this handgun; no not at all; why are we forgetting that unlike other 7.62x25 caliber handguns (TT, CZ52 and even the C96-7.63x25) it has a Picatinny rail where all the bells and whistles aka “bling bling” could be attached. NP22 has currently established itself in our country in the 9mm division and the same may be expected from PX-3.\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-373_zps25b80089.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-373_zps25b80089.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-372_zps4aa7d940.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-372_zps4aa7d940.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-371_zpse32e54fa.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-371_zpse32e54fa.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nThe grips on PX-3 are moulded plastic and the checkering is negligibly aggressive.  The magazine release has slanting serrations. The serrations on the slide are tilted towards the front from top and are sufficiently grooved to give the user a clamping grip. The piece which we were testing at the range was somewhat excessively oiled but we could still grip the slide very comfortable with sweaty and oily hands. Horizontal serrations have been made in the trigger guard which is a blessing for shooters like me who tend to place their index finger of the support hand on these serrated trigger guards. PX-3 is featured with white three-dot sight system that may be a breath of fresh air for the traditional 7.62x25 users.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-376_zps37d6ce38.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-376_zps37d6ce38.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-377_zps55b9fb6d.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-377_zps55b9fb6d.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3710_zps179474df.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3710_zps179474df.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3715_zps3a4d3897.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3715_zps3a4d3897.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nMechanically speaking, to naked eye, there is no significant change in the design of PX-3 from NP22 with the exception of an elongated grip eventually a result of the longer 7.62x25 caliber round. We didn’t have NP22 on the range however, it was confirmed by the rest of the PG members like Aquarius and Colt1911 that the grips may be the only difference between the two.\n[B]\nLength 199mm (7.83 Inches)[/B]\n[B]Height 140mm (5.51 Inches)[/B]\n[B]Barrel length 112mm (4.41)[/B]\n[B]Number of rifling grooves 4 (With Clockwise turns)[/B]\n[B]Weight (excluding magazine) 820gm[/B]\n[B]Magazine weight (empty) 100 gm, [/B]\n[I](The above information on length, weight etc is sourced from the manual which came with the handgun)[/I]\n \nAs stated earlier, PX-3''s sights are easy-to-see, however, a new user may (or may not) initially have to struggle with them to get-used-to. NP22 users may not feel any difference whatsoever with its sights. About the trigger, what we all noticed (and was quite interesting) that it was satisfactorily crisp. Yes, we were under the impression that like many other handguns, PX-3’s trigger may also require break-in but in-fact it didn’t at all. The first stage travel was medium length and then the second stage started and ended immediately; there was a negligible travel. The trigger broke quite crisply and this I am stating in comparison to CZ handguns. By no way am I stating that it had a better trigger than the CZ; rather I am trying to say that it performed better than what we expected. The trigger reset was very short and quick double or triple taps were easily possible with it. (Clearly captured in the videos)\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3714_zpsc782b971.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3714_zpsc782b971.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nThe pistol’s slide profile is slimmer than that of a Duty P07, which was available on the range so from everyday carry point of view if one feels comfortable with NP22 or Duty, PX-3 won’t be even minutely different. Talking about levers and other related protrusions, the decocker was not that intuitive to operate however the magazine release was easier to reach.\n\nStay tuned.. There is more to come.', ''),

(617185, ' [B][U]EVERY DAY CARRY[/U][/B]\nWith my stature (in dimensional terms…. :D ), even CZ97B is an everyday carry gun so I don’t consider myself to be the right person to give his opinion on the matter, however, if one feels comfortable in carting around NP22 for everyday carry, PX-3 would also not be a turn off. I guess a simple belt holster should suffice for carrying PX-3. The full-sized grip might create some issues for certain holster choices. PX-3 offers more than reasonable capacity (considering its old aged competitors in similar calibre) and is still very much concealable.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3711_zpsf9f36495.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3711_zpsf9f36495.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3712_zps5f16c3db.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3712_zps5f16c3db.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n \n[B][U]METALLURGY [/U][/B]\nI always wonder how come people start commenting on metallurgy when they don’t have access to any lab which can analyse the chemical composition of a metal or give exact info on the type/grade of metal being used. Yes, yes I am sure it must be a surprise to some but that is the fact which our dear commentators need to realize that you actually require a technical lab/facility to analyse metallurgy and can’t actually be done while sitting in-front of a computer. I also don’t have access to any such lab so would refrain from commenting on it. If at all I have to comment, I will do so with regard to PX-3’s built quality and that too in comparative terms. So here is how I can put it in simplest possible way; [I]“The built quality of PX-3 seems similar to NP22 or HP77B”[/I]. I don’t think anything else needs to be stated here anymore.\n \n[B][U]RANGE REPORT[/U][/B]\nFor many shooters, TT has always been considered exceptionally accurate and thus the same may be expected from PX-3 as well. At the range, since the only available ammo was Norinco, we could not run a selection of other popular ammunition through it like the Czech S&B or Serbian Prvi etc, well next time, inshAllah. \n \nAs one might expect that due to its 7.62x25 calibre PX-3 may have a hard recoil, in fact that’s not the case and its recoil can be categorized in medium-recoil pistols (You will observe that in the videos). The full-sized grip certainly makes recoil manageable, though, and I found it to have more than acceptable accuracy for a carry gun. BTW, I really liked its full-sized grip.\n\nAs stated earlier, felt recoil was at an average level and seemingly due to its large grips the muzzle flip was very much in control. I personally, don’t feel comfortable with TT’s grips as they tend to be too skinny (in weaponry terms…. lol) for my taste. I’ve always found the grip on NP22 to be better contoured for my hands and PX-3 (despite being slightly larger) was no exception. Not only it fit well in my hand, I can confidently report that Aquarius and Colt1911 also felt comfortable with them. Shooting the PX-3 didn’t disappoint me or the other esteemed members present at the range, rather we all were sufficiently impressed with the accuracy level that can be obtained with its 7.62x25 caliber round. [B]Having put about 180 test rounds through PX-3, we didn’t experience a single malfunction.[/B]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3718_zps5c5f7141.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3718_zps5c5f7141.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3719_zps61aa04d9.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3719_zps61aa04d9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3720_zpsf8ec142a.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/PX-3 Test and Review/PX-3720_zpsf8ec142a.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nStay tuned.

(617189, ' To hunt within the border belt you need a hunting permit from DG Rangers or permission from other higher ups of Pakistan Rangers (PR). Wildlife department has no jurisdiction over the border belt. PR is all-in-all there. Although, if you do have a permit from Rangers you still need hunting license and can only hunt legal species.\nI think what wildlife inspector meant by notification was that every year provincial government issue a notification, sometimes in November, through wildlife department explaining opening date, limits, allowable species, means & methods, open thesils and other rules for the upcoming hunting season. He was probably asking you for that notification to see if dove hunting or trapping was allowed during the current season at the location you were at.\nHope that helps!', ''),

(617242, ' [QUOTE=ATA-;454862]D3 bro thanks for detail explanation.\nAb accessories would like to have quad rail, Vertical grip, scope, laser[/QUOTE]\n\nbro Quad rail is a must accessory even if you dont want to use more acessories for the rifle Quad rail is porous and airy it gives better air flow to barrel, it comes with two main advantages no1, you can put lot more accessories on the rifle by using quad rail at different angle''s according to your choice and hand placement eg left handed or right handed shooter, no.2 as i mentioned earleir it is quite airy so it will help the barrel to keep it self cool under rapid fires because it will desipate heat quickly out of barrel, a minor disadvantage is that because it is airy it will also allow proper oxygenation to barrel which can aid rusting of barrel in humid conditions but since the barrel keeps it self hotter during fire the vapours will keep on evaporating but after fire kindly remove the quadrail and clean the barrel thoroughly then apply some oil to it , best combo will be mobiloil+diesel combo(on outside of barrel) only on that side which is going to be covered by quadrail, \nNote: dont apply to much just oil it a bit ,bcz to much oil can also damage the outer paint coating of barrel now put your quad rail back and wrap it with 2-3 layers of heavy cloathing and then store it, you will be good,\n\nfor vertical grips you can get them they are good if you experiance some recoil issues and therefore can;t aim your gun properly but the angle of the wrsit sometimes in this position becomes awkward and some people complain that there hand''s are aching or they can;t grip gun properly for this adjust the grip and the foldstock according to your comfortabilty , you can also use handstop grip and angled foregrips if you dont find verticle grips comfortable i will suggest you angled foregrips becaz of there desighn they give you more mobilty and dont add much weight to anterior part of the gun , i don''t know wether they are available in pakistan or not, but vertical grips are not bad either , you know it is matter of choice one liking are different from other persons some times,\n\nLaser, honestly i will not suggest you if you are a new gun handler, 1st laser pointers are battery operated even though laser follows a stright path but at 300+ meters it is not going to help you much so far , if you have extra money, if you want to use gun within 200yards, if you just want to add some more looks to your gun then purchase laser pointers,\nLaser optics: these are very expensive beuties i just saw a couple of them in lahore markets they are very reliable some of them are integrated with range finders while other help you to focus properly but still i will not vote either Laser pointers nor Laser optics bcz they together dont make a good gunner, bad items for practice shooters\n\nScopes: yeh this is some thing i will add in must items you should buy a scope no gun is completed without a good scope, if you dont like big heavy scopes then you can use greendot and red dotsights these are very easy to use they dont require much adjustments all you have to do is to look through them place the green or red dot on the target and fire , this is as easy and that, but they are limited for efficency for upto 70-120 yards only, if you want long range shooting like 400-500 yards then you need a scope, many different scopes from nikon to carlziess are available, cheap china scopes are also available they can save you a lot of bucks and are not bad either for reliabilty, if you have much more to spend then go for expensive Leupold scopes these are USA manufactured and can give you best quality, but keep this thing in mind more money always don''t get you a best item many other compnies can offer you the same specs with less bang of money, here your window shopping and knowledge will help you my friend,\n\nExtra magazines:\ni add them in must list, bcz who likes to refill the empty mags while on shooting again and again , buy P-mags if you have less money they are good for those AR''s which are based on original colt design they don''t jam the gun they are most reliable mags out in the market ,E-mags are more expensive than P-mags they can be used with a big varitey of guns Like AR''s ,HK''s and many more chambered for the specific cartridge, i will suggest you to get P-mags they are not bad and military itself uses them, in latest trends they have empty spacing on the side of magazine some are transparent to give you idea how much bullets are left in gun, it is just the matter of choice what you like, i will suggest the one with spaces they are mettalic and durable other than transparent plastic ones and they serve the same purpose of letting you know how much bullets are left in magazines you can see bullets from a curved cut on the side of magazine,\nI am done......', ''),

Some gun expert or a Baikal 155 owner from the forum will definitely shed some light on this issue. However, here is rookie’s guess:\nI am not familiar with Baikal brand but I think black spots are being formed on your gun''s mag tube by the hot gases venting through the gas bleeding ports or holes in your barrel, just like it happens on the mag tube of my Remington. I use dry lube on the magazine tube before shooting and that makes it a lot easier to remove these carbon deposits.  When cleaning these spots I use bore cleaner while lightly scrubbing them with fine steel wool or a tooth brush. Although spots come off easily but stain stays and that is not a big deal.\nThe key is not to apply too much pressure or use really abrasive/hard material for scrubbing. Baikal’s tube is probably made of light aluminum alloy just like Remington’s and rubbing too aggressively with really abrasive/hard material will make the tube thinner at this spot and that will be NOT good. \n\nHope that helps!', ''),

(617766, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;419856]Its a funny sounding question, but one that can have serious implications, especially for mods and admins. IMHO "keyboard commandos" are way worse than "mall ninjas".\n \nHere''s how I see it... In the online world, the "mall ninja" is the equivalent of the "nerd" or the "dork" in  school. He''s the guy with a red dot, dual lasers, tactical light, and infrared illuminator on his grand dad''s old hunting rifle. He''ll post about the new "tactical spring" he got for his mag release that''s sooo much better than your factory spring because it''s made from grade 2165 unobtainium and will last 567,223 magazine releases. Anyways, he may be annoying, but harmless, and may even contribute to keep things entertaining. \n\nThe "keyboard commandos" on the other hand, are like the ones who were the bullies in the playground. They are far from being the smartest, but are always right (in their mind). They  have to have their way, and if you disagree with them, they will impose their will upon you by way of ridiculing, criticizing every post you make, and mocking every thought you share. Sure it''s just the Internet, but nonetheless, just words can make people feel very uncomfortable. As a result, members post less and less, then stop posting, and if the harrassment continues, they eventually stop visiting the forum (or blog, or website, or channel) altogether. And where a once hot spot, virtual or real, becomes unpopular, it is very difficult to turn things around. Anyways, just something to think about... \n\nWith the online world becoming such a large part of our lives, and a place where we spend so much time, "Internet bullying" has become a real issue for many kids, and even adults. Yet unlike in the schoolyard, no one''s going to get a black eye for standing up to the bigger kid, we should all do our part to stop it. The real world is tough enough, let''s keep the online world fun for everyone![/QUOTE]\nTotally agreed and usually the aggrieved party  becomes the abuser in the future \nlets all just try to adhere to this advice if you all know what i mean seeing a few latest posts by our esteemed members', ''),

(617914, ' A sig club, eh? \nId like to bring back the respect and honor of sig, in my mind. So without further ado, \nas the first gun ive ever fired, i tried out a Sig P226. Needless to say, i HATED IT ( Not when shooting, of course, but right after when i tried a few other pistols ) The grip was too thick ( maybe it was just me. from my wrist to the tip of my middle finger, its just under 8 inches. Do sig-ers have bigger hands then mine?), the gun was heavy and unwieldy, ( not unmanageable, but "okward" ) Because of the weight, i think , the gun felt unnatural, as it was damping the behavior and recoil of the gun It felt....somewhat delayed and unnatural. Imagine power steering vs no power steering. With no power, you can feel everything, front he road surface to the position of the wheels, and the behavior of the car itself. With power steering ( electric, not hydraulic ) there is none of that. \n\n The mag never seated properly, a straight upward push wouldent seat it, it usually took me about 2-5 attempts to seat the mag, the recoil was in such a....unkempt and unrefined/unwieldy manner , i was all WTF was wrong with it after trying a few other pistols and ''volvers;\n\n when it recoiled it was not a straight upwards kick, even if i was holding it with two hands, and my left finger on the slide ( im RHD ) when it kicked it first went at a 300 degree angle( from my POV and 0 degrees is straight up, circle goes clockwise ) then went 270, then 180, then my own muscle force made it get back on track.  I got about 2 stovepipes with 100 rounds though it.\n\nThe mags, they were hell; as ive told you before, they never seated properly, and loading them was a pain in the a**. the spring was so stiff that the rounds were slipping, and my thumb got stubbed more then once while pushing them in. \n\nThe gun never...aimed properly, ( thats the only way i can put it. if there is a special phrase for this, tell me ) When i brought it up to my eye, i had to search for the sights every single time. so from raising the gun to firing, there was a 5 second delay. Mainly because i spent that much time looking for the irons. \n\nWhen i switched over to the springfield XD, its was...amazing. All my shots were dead on, the kick was nice and predictable, the weight was a featherweight, mags loaded and seated easy, and the grip safety combined with the 2 stage trigger was excellent. \n\nThe .357 mag was the same\nalthough it was not as intuitive for me, everything was nice. the kick was easily handled, it felt nice, controlled, accurate, and pedigree and well-behaved, although the kick was something i did not handle as well as the 9mm. Not the way it recoiled, but the force of it. \n\nSo seeing as how popular sigs are,they must be worth their weight in gold; is it just me that did not suit the gun ( if anyone can review it, too , please do it ), and if i plain sucked at shooting, i would be crap with the XD and the revolver too; or maybe i got handed a lemon?

Germans "complained" about Americans shotguns being ruthless, while they were torturing people and throwing them in gas chambers. Bottom line is, they wanted them, but didn''t have them. Nonetheless, they never have been nor are they currently banned. Ever heard of the M870 Remington? How about the M1014 Benelli? Both shotguns in active duty with the US Military.\n\nDon''t know about you, but I''ve always been taught that shotguns are the #1 choice for HD. I''m talking short, tactical shotguns that are maneuverable in tight spaces. I''m talking collapsible stocks, rails, and pistol grips, not your Grand Dad''s shottie he uses for bird hunting, with a 32" barrel. But regardless, they all have a wide poi, pumps/break actions are as reliable as guns get, and chances of over penetration are greatly reduced. \nIn other words, when you''re scared sh!tless, hands are shaking and the bg''s somewhere in your house, would you rather have a gun that shoots a 1/2 inch or less point of impact, or something that fires a 1/2 foot or more poi? When your family is at stake, would you rather have a semi auto that may or may not jam, or a pump that''s going to cycle as long as you still have your arms? When someone you love could be hiding in the next room, would you rather fire a round that could go through the wall and kill them, or something that will probably stop at the wall?\nThe choice should be obvious.

Lacking spunk, to put it another way. \n\nAll Carcal pistols = Because of the same reason as glock and Sig. But the unique thing is, when you tell them they are ugly, they blow up just like wives and girlfriends, except in this case they try to re-arrange your face with high speed bits of metal from the slide. \n\nI think....ive named pretty much every gun available in pakistan, for a reasonable price TBH, i only find extraordinarily few poly pistols good looking,and have a personal pref for the 92fs and the 1911.

(617988, 'Brass, Steel, Aluminum and nickel coated cartridges. And Lead vs Copper While carrying out my god-given duty to trollolol the internet and life in general, i came across stories of other types of ammo. From a far far land, they use ammo cased in steel and aluminium. \n\n*Sigh* this sounds dumb. ill get straight to the point. \n\nBrass is expensive, and the main reason for ammo costing so much. seeing as the reloading benefit of brass cannot be used in pakistan, as evident by the other thread i made. \n\nI.e( these are real prices, checked em out myself), 20 rounds of .223 Remington here in pakistan goes for a good 8 dollars, FMJ. In Brass\nThe same thing, in steel case goes for about 4 dollars. \n\nFor Aluminum cased ammo, CCI blazer Al case FMJ in 9mm goes for about 11 per 50 box, and 9mm in brass is about 16. \n\nthe only issue with steel and AL case is usually that a bit more cleaning is nessassary, and the extractor may or may not wear out more quickly. Seeing as a new extractor for a cz 75 is about 30 USD, and it will wear out after going well into the thousands of rounds, that is not a issue. \n\nSo my Q is, seeing as we cannot reload, why do we use brass cases in pak? getting the dealers to import Tula ammo, or make local darra ammo that is cheaper. It cant be THAT hard, there is only about a 300 C differential between the melting points of steel and brass. The same thing applies to the lead and copper issue. Quite a few darra bullets ive seen use copper, not lead. Why? nobody here is going for a contest or anything, we just wanna shoot stuff.', ''),

Your opinion may differ but i can''t put my faith in the tiny .22lr especially when i have the option of the good old 9mm or .45\nI read a post on the forum one member shot and killed robbers with .22lr revolver with head shots,  he controlled the situation pretty well and must have a good aim and nerves, I for one don''t have steel balls to aim at the head nor i would be able to keep my self calm at the very best i would manage to stop my hands from shaking and this is the story of the average man, Now what i derive from the term Self defense is that to immediately stop a threat .22lr lacks that knock down power or energy to successfully drop/ neutralize the threat in one shot.

(617995, ' Whether it causes more or less wear, I can''t say for certain because I''ve never shot an equal number of rounds of both types of ammo through identical guns, and then measured the chambers and barrels for differences in rate of wear. What I can say for certain, is that shooting steel cased can be less reliable. Because steel doesn''t expand/contract as easily as brass (that''s why it can''t be reloaded), it doesn''t create a good seal as the cartridge goes off, and a lot of gasses blow back through the chamber. This results in lower pressures, and along with steel being less "slippery" than brass, cycling issues may result. Although some companies plate their steel cartridges in brass or coat them in lacquer in an attempt to mitigate those effects. But keep in mind, I''m not talking about every other round jamming. In my experience, with a gun that normally runs 100% with brass ammo, I might get 1 or 2 FTE''s out of every one or two hundred steel cased shots fired. Having said that however, I have witnessed guns that just won''t cycle steel cased at all: I just saw a guy having stoppages every other shot at the range, and he was complaining about the steel cased ammo; I don''t remember which pistol it was, the brand of ammo, nor if they were plated or coated.\n\nAlthough you may not wish to rely on it, if you do a lot of shooting at the range, or plinking in the fields, saving several hundred rs with every box of ammo will add up quick. Had a bunch of brass plated steel cased 223 a while back from Norinco, so I know they make it.\nIMO, if your gun feeds it, ejects it, then go ahead and shoot it... I do.', ''),

Add more, or tell us of the guns that you find ugly. \n\nEvery glock = No spunk, and plain ugly. \n\nEvery Sig Sauer pistol = the ugly ducklings. Functional, but very ugly nevertheless, short, fat, but in every review and test (except mine) they get straight As and you get the feeling thats what burger boys would be like if they were guns. \n\nThe DSA Trushot= same reason as the Sig. I think it is because of the very thick slide/barrel portion that i find em ugly looking. \n\nThe TT-30 = You all know why. Its hard to explain, but you know. \n\nThe [COLOR=#3E3E3E]CF 98/NP42/QSZ-92 = most bland and dull design seen in the history of guns. \n\n[/COLOR]The Walther 22 = looks lie a china toy with all those indents and depressions. Id go as far as to call it a geological nightmare, if there was a piece of land shaped like so. \n\nThe CZ-999 = just plain ugly, like the glocks and the sigs\n\nAll Taurus pistols except the 92fs and the ''volvers\n\nThe Tangfolio Viper and Sarsimilaz B6 = Have no persona when you look at it. Lacking spunk, to put it another way. \n\nAll Carcal pistols = Because of the same reason as glock and Sig. But the unique thing is, when you tell them they are ugly, they blow up just like wives and girlfriends, except in this case they try to re-arrange your face with high speed bits of metal from the slide. \n\nI think....ive named pretty much every gun available in pakistan, for a reasonable price TBH, i only find extraordinarily few poly pistols good looking,and have a personal pref for the 92fs and the 1911. Most shiny ''volvers look nice, along with most high end classic with good designs( all high-class flintlocks, are beauties to behold) \n\nAlmost all metal auto-istols are good lookin, with the exception of pistols who have a too fat/too thin slide area ( The Sigs and the TT, respectively. ( no kidding. the TT looks like a starved child, or a person with anorexia) \nAnd probably pissed off everyone who owns these, ( pretty much all of PG ) \nIll go hide in some other thread now. \n\nGive your own opinions, flames on my sense of taste, and show general hate and displeasure of me insulting your guns in general alongside your own ugliest guns list below \\/\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\/[/QUOTE]\n\nBro MAy be they are ugly to you but beauty lies in the eyes of beholder! :) but glocks yes they are Ugly!', ''),

I can''t do it but I''ve seen people hit targets out to 100m with baby Glocks. However with a pocket pistol, the main concern is accuracy within 10m, which the G30 is more than capable of in the hands of an average shooter.\nDurability and reliability is all standard Glock. And don''t worry about "big bore", 45ACP is actually a very low pressure round, it''s just fat. FYI, I have a G20 (10mm) that shoots ammo capable of taking down black bears, even moose (can weigh upto 1000lbs). I''ve never done it, but I know a lot of people in Alaska who carry the G20 with really hot ammo for protection against large animals.\nLastly, I never bother to look into serial numbers, prefixes or what the dot and pentagon stands for, but there are lots of websites that can help you with that.', ''),

Supply and demand dictates that the lower the price per unit, the more is sold. Like with most things, if you buy more (they sell more), a lower price can usually be had per unit. But it also works in reverse if demand is lowered...\n If 100,000 is required to run a shop each month (with profit, utilities, rent, wages, etc), and the shop sells 100 items per month; an average of 1k per unit sold is required. But if they lose business and average only 50 items sold each month, there''s only one way for prices to go, if the store wants to stay in business.', ''),

Germans "complained" about Americans shotguns being ruthless, while they were torturing people and throwing them in gas chambers. Bottom line is, they wanted them, but didn''t have them. Nonetheless, they never have been nor are they currently banned. Ever heard of the M870 Remington? How about the M1014 Benelli? Both shotguns in active duty with the US Military.\n\nDon''t know about you, but I''ve always been taught that shotguns are the #1 choice for HD. I''m talking short, tactical shotguns that are maneuverable in tight spaces. I''m talking collapsible stocks, rails, and pistol grips, not your Grand Dad''s shottie he uses for bird hunting, with a 32" barrel. But regardless, they all have a wide poi, pumps/break actions are as reliable as guns get, and chances of over penetration are greatly reduced. \nIn other words, when you''re scared sh!tless, hands are shaking and the bg''s somewhere in your house, would you rather have a gun that shoots a 1/2 inch or less point of impact, or something that fires a 1/2 foot or more poi? When your family is at stake, would you rather have a semi auto that may or may not jam, or a pump that''s going to cycle as long as you still have your arms? When someone you love could be hiding in the next room, would you rather fire a round that could go through the wall and kill them, or something that will probably stop at the wall?\nThe choice should be obvious.

If i were to be perfectly honest, a small, short bullpup shotgun in semi or pump take your pick, like the KSG loaded with sabot slugs and a rifled barrel would be my top choice. The reason why i choose slugs instead of buckshot, is beauce in the short ranges that HD encounters are made in, the "spread" of buck is nonexistent. \n\nI have a nagging feeling that EVERYBODY who is going for .22 for a HD weapon has never in their life experienced such a situation. \n\nI think, everyone here needs to go play paintball and realize how ******* hard it is to actually shoot someone who is having a go at you. If you are lucky, you can land a chest shot. id rather have more stopping power in that one hit then *hope* that i magically will get a headshot every time. This is real life. not call of duty people. If any of you have played arma, americas army, ISI, delta force, or any realistic shooter you have a inkling of what i am talking about. \n\nPlease dont give me any of that optimistic stuff. We are looking for things that can kill reliably, even with less then perfect shots. 22 lr does not fit the bill. It can kill, no doubt about that. But as reliably as a bigger caliber? nope. And please, none of that .22 lr has low recoil and lots of rounds. 9mm weapons have MORE rounds and manageable recoil, enough that greenhorns are given 9mm to start with. And once again, with a less then perfect shot, significant damage will still occur. And once again, please none of that " less lethal" stuff about not wanting to kill the robber. The second you point your weapon at something, YOU WANT IT TO DIE, BE DESTROYED COMPLETELY AND SENT TO THE 7TH LEVEL OF HELL. PERIOD. \nbe it for the sake of food, defense, or offence. \nThe only thing a surviving attacker will do is either sue you in court ( and win, if its the western world) or stay there and pop a few more rounds at you.\n\nAs for Fudge and seeker, get over your girlish slap-fest. You are making youselves look bad. Both of you are grown, respectable men and members of our PG society. Show it. Give us some real fierce debate, on logic and points rather then this husband and wife quarrel. \n\n\n\n@ED\nSeriously, 10 yards and you couldent hit it? even with 4 years of practice?

The modular frame made use of a fiber-reinforced plastic which combined the trigger guard, grip, and integral magazine well.

STI''s modular frames are marketed under the brand name 2011 (a take on the 1911 name).[/COLOR][/I][COLOR=#000000]\n \nOn to my gun, the grip texture checkering is amazingly sharp, your hands do not slip.  All parts are crisp fitting and neatly finished.  I found no warping or shrinkage anywhere on the metals due to casting (thats if anything was casted.  The hammer was well polished where it needed to be and the trigger breaks somewhere between my CZ75 TS customized (Thunderbolt) and the standard Sig X5 Tactical.  The bull barrel is HUGE... the barrel is much thicker than that found on the Sig X series of pistols - I make that comparison because I had a few and they too have the thicker barrels.  Barrel lug is where one normally sees a lot of left over tool marks and scratches; however, on this gun it was nicely clean and precisely fitted.  The two stage spring guide rod is very nicely setup with the reverse guide rod plug with the initial recoil spring setup for 10lbs only for 9mm.  The ambidexterous safeties are very light and crisp in movement for lock and unlock.  The beavertail is very tightly and neatly fitted.  I took it apart to see what else was inside and this gun comes with the S7 sear.  Sights are fiber in the front and Bomar style rear.  Ah, what to say except I can''t wait to do a range test on it.  Currently the GClub is closed for shooting... so all I can do is just look at my patiently-acquired-well worth-toy.\n[/COLOR][ATTACH=CONFIG]32006[/ATTACH][COLOR=#000000]\n[/COLOR][ATTACH=CONFIG]32007[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]32008[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]32009[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]32010[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]32011[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]32012[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]32013[/ATTACH]', ''),

I''m constantly buying ammo, It''s a fixed expense, part of my monthy budget along with food, phone, utilities, etc. Otherwise, like hmd said, 1k per caliber is a good rule of thumb and if you only shoot one caliber then keep 5000. It may sound crazy to the uninitiated, but it''s not paranoia, not even for shtf situations, that''s only if you just like to shoot... \n\nThink about it like this:  1 round every 6 seconds is a nice slow rate of fire. That means, 100 rounds every 10 minutes. I can''t speak for others, but when I go to the range, I usually spend 3-4 hours there. Include some time for loading mags, changing targets, checking groups, bs''ing with the guys, whatever, and I''ll still go through 500-600 rounds in that time. I try to do that every other week, so if I don''t have time to go to the store, or if they don''t have what i want, you can see how several thousand rounds won''t last very long. \n\nAnyways, what''s your shooting routine like?', ''),

(618194, ' Thanks for sharing that Faisji bro, it''s really interesting research. Disregarding the rifle and shotgun, it appears all the handgun calibers quite comparable. Its interesting to note that .22 had the highest probability of incapacitating with one hit, on average it required the least number of rounds to incapacitate, and tied with .357 for most likely to end in death. These are stats from actual gunfights, so I think there''s a really simple explanation: Shot placement has everything to do with incapacitation, and a .22 shot is the easiest to place. That''s surely the case for the average person, but I''ve actually had that discussion with competitive shooters who also said that, no matter how well they can shoot a 9, 40, or 45, it''s still easier to shoot a 22. Obviousy, traits suchs as being "simple" and "requiring less effort" are beneficial, especially under stress, but I never really thought about the real world ramifications of that until now.', ''),

It must have been too loud in the store so I only heard it after getting home, and of course the store was closed by then, so I was pissed! Only thing I could do at that point was look online to see if it was something I could fix myself. So I googled "Sig rattle", and when I saw all the results that came up, I was relieved and disappointed at the same time. It''s apparently quite common and theres no "cure" but like I said, it doesn''t affect accuracy or reliability, but is extremely annoying (like how once you notice something, you always notice it). Anyways, I got another one and it didn''t rattle... at first, and then it started. I got a used one, and it rattled. I got another one, and it hasn''t rattled... yet :) \nSooo, that''s my story of the [I]notorious Sig rattle[/I] :lol:', ''),

(618247, ' I respectfully disagree. Unless you only concern yourself with Colt 45''s, the contemporary definition of "1911" refers to a platform, or style of gun. There are many manufacturers of it, and they don''t all follow identical specs. If it has an SAO fire control group, sear blocking thumb safety,  trigger blocking grip safety, straight pull trigger, Browning design tilting barrel with toggle link, and preferably a barrel bushing (cough, Moeen, cough, cough :)), it''s considered a 1911. Otherwise it makes no difference what caliber it is, how long the slide is, how wide the grip is, what material it''s made of, how far the controls stick out, whether they''re on both sides or just the left, or what kind of sights are on it. In fact, if you had a 1911 made like the first ones ever produced, down to the very last detail... you''d have a pretty crappy gun :lol:', ''),
(618248, ' Salam All,\nVery nice to have you here PDW; however, nothing is written in stone...  having said that I will elaborate on your statement.\nThe original design of the 1911 is a 7 shot gun, as time progressed so were the customizations done to the 1911 from various gunsmiths (some of whom are now complete firearms manufacturers) like Wilson Combat, Les Baer, Ed Brown, EGW, Briley and the list goes on and on.  The biggest setback in present day that a 1911 owner faces more so in competitions has been the lack of hicapacity.  ParaOrd and Caspian were the front runner in the Hi Capacity 1911 (yes that what it is... called that by the manufacturers 1911).  Only, STI and SVI decided to call them 2011s.  All others still call them 1911.', ''),

(618570, 'Six new licenses (shotgun, rifle, handgun), purchase advice appreciated Dear all,\r\n\r\nI have been a silent observer of this forum for a few years now, and very regularly over the past few months.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of my father being a retired bureaucrat and his terminal post and post-retirement job, as well as my employment for a US multinational, exposing him and us (his family) to a number of ongoing security threats, we recently acquired three licenses each for personal protection purposes. These were applied for in June and received in July.\r\n\r\nI am now at a loss as to what exactly to procure, and would greatly appreciate the help of the experts on this forum.\r\n\r\nBased on extensive online research, I have narrowed it down as follows:\r\n\r\nLicense #1: 12-gauge shotgun under my name\r\n- Beretta A400 Xplor Unico already procured under the advice of keen hunter friends\r\n- Will be used for the occasional hunt and home defense purposes\r\n\r\nLicense #2: 12-gauge shotgun under my father''s name\r\n- Thinking of importing with FBR clearance an AyA SxS\r\n- For the very occasional hunt, although really for the aesthetic value and heirloom purposes\r\n- If FBR clearance is not forthcoming, I am thinking of a Beretta O/U or SxS. This will be a present to my father from me, so I have no issue spending ''big bucks'', in the range of 500K+ depending on the quality of what''s available\r\n\r\nLicense #3: 9mm handgun under my name\r\n- Thinking of either Glock 17/19, Beretta 92FS, CZ P-01, or SIG P226\r\n- Budget around 350K\r\n- This will be for defensive carry in the car on occasions where I feel necessary (traveling with female friends, late night driving, etc.), and most importantly, for when I go hiking -- I would like the gun to be visible as a deterrent against anyone who thinks here''s a poor rich city boy who we can rob or kidnap at will. I am NOT into concealed carry, so while light weight would be nice to keep hiking pack loads down, it is not critical.\r\n- I am in love with the looks and heritage of a Beretta 92FS, have great respect for Glocks for their uncomplicated operation and minimal looks, revere the SIG for its mythic status, and respect the CZ for not making me feel like an idiot paying 3-5x the actual retail on the other guns.\r\n\r\nLicense #4: 9mm handgun under my father''s name\r\n- Budget around 250K\r\n- This will be entirely for self defence purposes. Will probably be kept at home throughout its life by my father, in some drawer somewhere, and hardly if ever taken to a range\r\n- For this reason, I am thinking of a low-maintenance easy to use revolver\r\n- I would like a Smith & Wesson but am not sure of availability of new models in Pakistan. If a revolver is not available, then I''m thinking of a relatively low-cost CZ, e.g. 75B\r\n- As I understand it, changing from a 9mm to a typical revolver bore should not be problematic\r\n\r\nLicense #5: .22 rifle under my name\r\n- Budget around 250K\r\n- This will be used for target practice at the range since no larger rifles are allowed at LRC, and the occasional hunt, as well as to prepare myself for a larger bore rifle on more serious hunts (see below)\r\n- I would like a bolt action for the simplicity/heritage of the action design\r\n- I am not sure what is available in the market, but would like the best within my budget\r\n\r\nLicense #6: .22 rifle under my father''s name\r\n- Budget around 350K\r\n- This will be used very very occasionally for big-game hunting should the opportunity ever present itself, and otherwise for heirloom purposes.

So far my vote goes to either PARA or Buksh Elahee.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nI cannot say much about actually obtaining the weapons in question, as ive never purchased a weapon in pakistan.\n\nBut as for what to use, your current Beretta can easily double as a HD weapon. Nice, reliable, and from a well known manufacturer. But when not hunting, when its kept at home, use imported shells only. Not to shed dirt on the local makes, ( shaheen etc ) but some of them do have a reputation for breaking in the weapon itself. Not often, mind you but it has happened. \n\nIt will be best to keep the guns under the name of the person who will be keeping and using them. Caught with a other persons weapon even if it is under their fathers/uncles names, ive had this happen to more then one friend over the year, and fortuantely the LEAs were lenient enough to let him go, but strictly/legally speaking, he should have been jailed for that act, or at least handed a hefty fine.  \n\nFor the second licence, the glock and the cz75/85 are roughly the same in utility and use. Get the one that suits you the most. However, if practicality is your thing, the 92fs is the way to go (provided it suits you). Even if some real harsh import issues come along, to the extent of arms embargo''s, the local POF factory is making a 92fs replica, called the POF PK-9 . That means if ever needed and even if import is banned/stopped for whatever reason, replacement mags/parts are available to a extent. \n\nSince you have such a large budget, Id advise you to not get the .22 lr rifle at all. What i propose, is for small time hunting and target practice, get a PCP airgun in .22 caliber, such as a Hatsan. Largely, it can take whatever game you can with a .22 lr rifle, provides a unit for cheap target practice, is superior in accuracy compared to the .22 lr. You can pick up the entire setup for about 95k, roughly. Also, when you said "big game hunting" with a .22, that is a....oxymoron, to put it bluntly. You cannot take a large animal with a small caliber like that. You will be suffering from both range, power, knockdown and penetration issues. It is possible, very much so, but there is more luck then skill involved. At more then 70-100 meters the .22 lr starts tumbling and goes off course majorly anyway. Past 50m, you chance of taking even small game like rabbits slims down. Most likely, you will just hurt it and make it die slowly over the course of a few hours then a clean kill.  \n\nWith the last spare licence, pick up a nice bolt action in either 30-06 or 7mm Rem mag. Savage rifles are good, but if you want a real show stopper, go for a match version of the legendary Winchester model 70, once again in either 30-06 or 7mm rem mag. \n\nSince you have...high end political clearance, even if you cant find these at a shop, getting it imported will probably not be too much of a hassle.', ''),

For example, hunting guns typically have long barrels that make them very unwieldy and thus a poor tactical choice for maneuvering in and around buildings and vehicles. Going around blind corners is extremely difficult, and knocking some furniture over or bumping the long barrel into something can give your position away, which in itself could be a fatal error. The O/U, SxS guns you are considering only hold 2 shells at a time, and the A400 you already purchased only holds 3 in order to comply with the laws of many countries that restrict magazine capacity for hunting. Yes, there are guns that can do both, but if you have a serious security concern, you would be best advised to acquire a gun designed specifically to serve that particular role.[QUOTE=1stranger;456399]Seconddly, if you are new to gun consider keeping a firearm with [B]safety[/B] or decocker as well...and as seniors advise, beggeiners should start from a hammer fired pistol instead of a striker fired... However, you may opt for for striker fired and hammer fired eand practice extensively so you remain no longer a beginner :)[/QUOTE]Safety is paramount. If you are new to shooting, there''s a powerful quote that has shaped the progression of my experience with guns, both as a hobby and as a sport. I always keep it in mind, and it is very simply: Your first mistake with a firearm, could be the last mistake of your life.[QUOTE=1stranger;456399]Thirdly, I would as per limited knowledge, advise you not to open carry (as you described in hiking etc...) this is for two reasons...1.

Even in the few states where open carry is permitted it is generally not practiced, especially in densely populated urban areas and major cities, unless people just want to make a statement. Also consider the element of surprise, it is a major tactical advantage which you forego when your weapons are on display. If someone is really out to get you, and you tell them what kind of gun you have and where you keep it; it will have the opposite effect of being a deterrent. Again, to echo 1stranger, [I]a weapon is no guarantee to safety[/I]. In otherwords, say someone buys a piano, surely they could make sounds, but that doesn''t make them a musician. You''ve told us how much you want to spend on guns; but the real questions are: how much will you spend on training, and how much time will you invest into practice?[QUOTE=1stranger;456399]Last but not the least, a brotherly advice to you is that if you can get quality firearms in reasonable budget dont go for extravagance... as extravagance is not permissible in Islam.[/QUOTE]I understand everybody wants nice stuff, and the attraction to guns for a lot of guys is at least partly due to aesthetics; and some guns [I]are[/I] purely made for beauty. So instead of filling all your licenses at once, why not just buy a couple guns first, learn how to use them properly. You will get a thousand answers from PG, but only from that experience will you really come to know: what works for you and what doesn''t, what you like and what you don''t, what you need and what you want.

In Canada it''s not illegal either, so long as the person borrowing has proof of registration and is licensed for that class of firearm. \n\n\n[I]Everybody [/I]needs a .22! And almost everyone who is into guns has one, it''s the best selling rifle cartridge in the world and the best selling pistol cartridge in the world. Admittedly I don''t have much experience with air guns, PCP or otherwise, but I do have alot of experience with 22''s and unless you are thinking 22 longs or 22 shorts, I highly doubt the two are comparable in terms of power and/or accuracy.\nA standard 22lr topped with a round nose lead bullet weighs 40gr, and goes about 1100fps, which results in approximately 110ft-lbs of energy. Now, correct me if I''m wrong, but doesn''t a 22 caliber air rifle pellet weigh less and travel slower than that? If either speed or velocity is reduced, it will result in less energy, meaning a less powerful projectile. That also means it will have a poorer ballistic coefficient than a .22lr, which means less accuracy. I can also attest to the fact that a standard velocity 22lr RNL bullet does not tumble at 100m because I regularly shoot paper targets at 150m and at times out to 175m, with no keyholing (bullet hitting target sideways).

They find the full frame gun, and start to interrogate him. As the gun is his uncles, he has no licence on him, and the rangers get called. the rangers, finding him with a gun that has no licence, arrest him and start to take him away. At the last moment, he decides a week- or maybe 5 years in jail werent worth it, and calls his uncle, who then talks to the rangers/guards. Needless to say, they refuse to believe him, and make to arrest him anyway. After a long, LONG chat, and plenty of peacocks flashing their feathers ( multiple relatives had to get in contact with em, and state their positions and worth and influences and political friends, ) Then finally, after the entire 3 hour ordeal, he was let go. Although this was to be expected by now, his uncle got pissed at him doing something so reckless ( carrying a weapon like that with no licence and pretty much on full display to the world ) had a friend come and take the weapon from him and to his uncle, then tell him, until he was 18, no more firearms.\n\nWith PCPs, in the .22 caliber, you can hit about a good 50-70FPE at the muzzle with a repeater style rifle, and if you go up slightly in price ( no insane price increments as no taxes etc for airguns ) PCP rifles like the airforce condor easily put out 90-105 FPE at the muzzle. In airguns, we try to avoid increasing the speed too much( not to say they cannot push normal pellets to 1000+ FPS, but for accuracy we either slow it down a bit or we use a heavier pellet; Think pistol ballistics. a .223 caliber will be downright useless in a pistol so we use .45, even though it is slower, it functions better on the target( a animal cannot outrun a 600-800 fps projectile, hell, it cannot outrun a 400 fps projectile; so why have a higher speed when you can put the power to better use with a heavier projectile?).For a lighter pellet, it does not have the initial break through energy as a firearm will, and when breaking the sound barrier will tumble. instead, we switch out to using heavier, streamlined slugs, at subsonic speeds ( subsonic rounds, be they fired from airgun or firearm are more accurate due to to boom interference.) \n\nTaking into account that you can shoot a airgun anywhere at all ( try that with a firearm ) in terms of practicality the PCP wins out. In accuracy, well, its a commonly accepted truth that PCP airguns are the most accurate projectile weapon available in the 21st century.  \n\nHere is the Pros for each from my side=\n\nPCP=\ncan take the same game\ndoes not take a extra licence, so you can have 4 weapons instead of 3\nSame power, go buy a air force condor and you will have the same impact energy as a .22lr\nless noisy\nfire anywhere you want= allows for practice in neighborhoods and your backyard, in a urban area.\nno hearing protection needed\ncheaper ammo\nallows you to get a big game rifle early, and not spend unnecessary money on a .22 lr\nprovides you with some degree of practice and experience\nLess, FAR less things to maintain.

(618615, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;456406]\n...A defensive shotgun and hunting shotgun are very different things, built to serve two very fife rent purposes. For example, hunting guns typically have long barrels that make them very unwieldy and thus a poor tactical choice for maneuvering in and around buildings and vehicles. Going around blind corners is extremely difficult, and knocking some furniture over or bumping the long barrel into something can give your position away, which in itself could be a fatal error. The O/U, SxS guns you are considering only hold 2 shells at a time, and the A400 you already purchased only holds 3 in order to comply with the laws of many countries that restrict magazine capacity for hunting. Yes, there are guns that can do both, but if you have a serious security concern, you would be best advised to acquire a gun designed specifically to serve that particular role...[/quote]\n\nNicely Explained Sir.

(618619, ' Thank you all immensely for your replies.\r\n\r\nVery interesting point regarding the ''art'' of deterrence. I will certainly consider. My thinking is -- and I keep telling my parents this, who worry far too much -- that I''m probably safer when I''m up north hiking than I am in Lahore, and I doubt anyone would come out all that way with the premeditated intention to kidnap or harm me. So I think the more likely threats are in fact from petty thieves or ''ad-hoc'' kidnappers who may in fact be deterred. In the city, I do think the threat is more credible and indeed a concealed carry option makes more sense. In that case, a lighter/smaller gun may be the answer. Also, I wasn''t aware that open carry is not permitted in Pakistan. In that case, how would someone carry a rifle or a shotgun when out on a legitimate hunt?\r\n\r\nI appreciate all the comments re: responsible gun use. My thinking is as follows. The ONLY reason I would ever draw or use a gun is if, god forbid, there is a threat to my or a loved one''s life, or god forbid any sexual assault against a female companion. All other situations, specifically threat to my property, money etc. (e.g. car snatching, pickpocketing) do NOT call for any violent retaliation on my part. Nothing is more sacred than one''s life.\r\n\r\nI smile at how my budget may have given the impression that money is not an issue -- on the contrary. However, I consider these one-time purchases that I would look forward to handing down to my children, and reliability with such instruments is paramount. Hence my willingness to shell out hard earned money. When it comes to extravagance, your point is well taken. To be honest, my friends and social circle would in fact frown upon guns -- there are too many bad associations with the type of people who brandish their weapons as signs of their masculinity. Hence my ownership of a gun is for my personal use only -- extravagance is something I associate with proudly displaying expensive objects to one''s friends for the purpose of showing off, which is not something I would do.\r\n\r\nRegarding the A400 Xplor -- I believe the shotgun in the Pakistani market does not have the round limiting plug. If it does, I believe it is relatively easy to remove. Should, god forbid, I ever encounter a home defence situation, I think a few rounds of the shotgun coupled with a handgun would be adequate. Beyond that, I''m not sure my choice of gun would be the determining factor. More likely (I hope!) it will be used for hunting. That is why I went with a semi-auto vs. an O/U or SxS, since I think it would be better suited for the HD and hunting dual purpose.\r\n\r\nI will certainly be using imported shells as I don''t see myself shooting (at most) more than a few hundred rounds a year, so the money saved is not worth the compromised reliability.\r\n\r\nRe: the .22 -- I apologize for not being clear on this and causing a misunderstanding. I do not intend to use it for big-game hunting, but in fact for target practice at the Lahore Rifle Club, where larger than .22 rifles are not allowed. Hopefully some of the skills thus acquired would carry over to if/when I ever go for a big-game hunt, in which case I would use either the 7mm or 30-06 procured on the other rifle license.\r\n\r\nI do plan on getting an air gun as well in any case, just because they''re fun! Most likely a Diana 34.\r\n\r\nRegarding importing any of these guns, I think the Grade 22 relaxation permits only one firearm to be imported. I know it''s Pakistan and ''exceptions'' can be granted with the right connections, but that is something my father is generally dead against, so it would have to be a single imported firearm, and that too only if it is explicitly permitted.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding not getting all these guns at once -- believe me, I am in no mood to put out such a large sum of money at once. The problem is -- and please correct me if I''m wrong -- I believe one has to purchase guns on a new license within 3 months of the license issuance, otherwise they stand cancelled. If possible, I would certainly like to stagger the purchases beyond the three months that I would otherwise have to comply with. There is no immediate need for two rifles, for example, and even the second shot gun could wait.', ''),

I for one, don''t know anyone who spends $20,000 on guns when they''re just getting into firearms :lol: \nBut I hope you can see how it may give the wrong impression when you say you''re going to spend all this money, on guns that many people aspire to own, and you''re going to get six of them... at once... as your first guns.\n[QUOTE=Taimur Malik;456442]\nRegarding the A400 Xplor -- I believe the shotgun in the Pakistani market does not have the round limiting plug. If it does, I believe it is relatively easy to remove. Should, god forbid, I ever encounter a home defence situation, I think a few rounds of the shotgun coupled with a handgun would be adequate. Beyond that, I''m not sure my choice of gun would be the determining factor. More likely (I hope!) it will be used for hunting. That is why I went with a semi-auto vs. an O/U or SxS, since I think it would be better suited for the HD and hunting dual purpose.[/QUOTE]\nIt''s not hard, but removing the plug only gives you an extra shell of capacity.

I know it''s Pakistan and ''exceptions'' can be granted with the right connections, but that is something my father is generally dead against, so it would have to be a single imported firearm, and that too only if it is explicitly permitted.[/QUOTE]\nIf you''re going to import, it may be wise to choose something in a caliber that is readily available in Pakistan.\n[QUOTE=Taimur Malik;456442]Finally, regarding not getting all these guns at once -- believe me, I am in no mood to put out such a large sum of money at once. The problem is -- and please correct me if I''m wrong -- I believe one has to purchase guns on a new license within 3 months of the license issuance, otherwise they stand cancelled. If possible, I would certainly like to stagger the purchases beyond the three months that I would otherwise have to comply with. There is no immediate need for two rifles, for example, and even the second shot gun could wait.[/QUOTE]\nRemember, you don''t have to own a gun permanently.

No need to verify as they were obtained through the proper channel, i.e. through a senior Punjab government official''s quota.\n\nI''m a little reluctant to share details, but with the right connections, anything is possible, even within days. Let me just tell you this: when we filled out the forms, sent them to the DCO''s office, and then asked where we would need to go for pictures etc., the answer was ''no where, just stay put.'' Within an hour, someone was at our front door with a digital camera and a large plastic sheet with some government seal embossed on it. The sheet was spread against a wall, our pictures were taken with it as the background, and the license was promised within days.\n\nIt took three weeks -- and not days -- after that because of Eid holidays and the printing press in Karachi (I understand all licenses are printed there) being closed for some time.\n\nI tell you this not to ''show off'' but to illustrate that in this country, VIP culture is rife, and ANYTHING is possible. I must admit that apart from being somewhat amused, I was rather disgusted and ashamed at how it all worked. I know people with needs just as legitimate as ours who have to wait years and pay all sorts of bribes to get gun licenses. It''s just not fair and incredibly unfortunate that even those who wish to follow the law find that their is no practical way to do so.\n\nBear in mind that (1) not a single penny was spent outside what is mandated by law, i.e. PKR 5000 per license, and (2) the only ''favour'' -- if you can call it that -- that we asked for is that the procedure be done according to the law and as per our entitlement as ordinary, law-abiding citizens. At no point did we ask for this VIP treatment, but alas it was given.\n\nIt''s at a point where my father is now reluctant to ask for additional favours, just because he too is rather put off by how it all transpired. For example, our licenses only provision 100 rounds per year -- not nearly enough to practice as you could well imagine. Yet he told me point-blank that he will not ask for this to be revised upwards, and it''s up to me to get this done through a dealer.', ''),

(618740, ' Again, very helpful posts, thank you all.\r\n\r\nWow, I guess I didn''t realize just how much it all added up to. 20K USD is kind of ridiculous. I guess that was the very upper limit, I''m hoping it doesn''t end up costing so much. And good to know re: how to get one''s license validity extended -- certainly makes things easier.\r\n\r\nHahah -- opening my holster. Hey, I''m not married, the girl''s cute, why not? We all have different morals, and that''s fair. But no, I had been planning to pick up a gun much before that -- that was just an anecdote in response to shahroze''s comments.\r\n\r\nRegarding gun training, use in high stress situations etc., I guess that''s something I''ll have to work towards, no other way.\r\n\r\nRegarding not using the guns much -- unfortunately that seems to be a logistical constraint I can''t avoid when it comes to shotguns specifically. The Lahore Rifle Club, where I''ve applied for membership, does not permit shotgun use. So that will probably have to be restricted to the odd days where I can go out to a friend''s farm or something. I do plan on practicing with the handgun far more. Shotguns for HD are kind of spray and pray anyway, no?\r\n\r\nRe: the rich kid comment, no offense taken at all. None of this is daddy''s money (there''s not much to go by), I''m salaried, I work hard and earn well. I''m (relatively) young, unmarried, I enjoy buying the best I can afford to avoid the false economy of saving pennies that could cost you more in the long run.\r\n\r\nSo here''s the plan.\r\n\r\nSeptember:\r\n\r\n- CZ P-01 or Glock 19, depending on what feels ''right'' at the time of purchase. If the CZ satisfies, I may go with that to keep costs down. Can always change later if I feel the need, as very wisely pointed out by many, and it also fits the concealed carry bill. For concealed carry purposes -- the virtues of which I''m now convinced of thanks to some very informative posts -- the Beretta 92FS doesn''t cut it, so it''s out... I think.\r\n\r\n- Diana 34. Because air guns are boss.\r\n\r\nOctober:\r\n\r\n- CZ or BRNO .22, since they''re relatively cheap.\r\n\r\nDeferred: \r\n\r\n- Revolver for my father if and when a good Smith & Wesson becomes available -- will extend the license in the meantime using the methods suggested.\r\n\r\n- An AyA shotgun if and when the import permit can be arranged -- again, will extend the license in the meantime\r\n\r\n- An extension on the second rifle license -- no need for a second one right now\r\n\r\n\r\nFudgepacker: I look forward to sharing pictures as well. The obligatory kitsch element is most appealing. What''s the protocol exactly? Guns to be photographed next to an expensive watch and pen, a vintage camera, a single malt and a cigar? Or perhaps the Eastern equivalent? A portly man playing the harmonium and his sidekick tabla-nawaz, floor cushions, a bejeweled sword, a dancing girl and a chalice brimming with Rooh Afza?\r\n\r\nOh the possibilities...', ''),

We all have different morals, and that''s fair...[/QUOTE]\nOh no bro, I''m not against thy at all :) \nI don''t know about 1stranger bro, but I was referring to your literal holster. What I meant was, don''t let the presence of others cloud your judgement. Do not open fire just because you have a girl next to you, and you think she expects you to do so. No matter how immasculating you think it may be, your obligation is to do what it takes to get out of the situation without firing a shot; be it retreating, apologizing, handing over money, possessions, crying, even begging. If all else fails and bodily harm is imminent, [I]then[/I], do what you feel you must do to protect yourself. Indeed, others have no right to rob you, but you have even less of a right to be the judge, jury, and executioner of their actions on the spot.\n\nOf course those are just my own values and beliefs. You may wish to take them into account, maybe not. But no matter, when you point a gun at somebody, you are effectively holding a human life in your hands. However you feel about it and what your values are, it''s not an easy decision to make... imagine having to make it in a split second. \n\nAlso regardless of values and beliefs on the subject, the following advice is universal...\nI don''t know if any classes are available to you, that teach the legal and moral obligations of carrying a firearm for protection, and the legal and moral ramifications of actually using it; but if there is, take it, if there isn''t, research it (in depth) yourself. Then, take a class that teaches you how to use a gun in that role ie. concealed carry by a civilian for personal protection. Then, practice, train, practice, and train. That can not be emphasized enough. Because as stated in your op, there is good reason to believe you are at increased risk for a personal security breach. So if the potential is likely there, you want to have as many decisions made before hand as possible. That is, God forbid it ever happens, but should it come to that, you want to know what you are going to do, as much as possible. \n\nBut remember, no matter what you decide, you will ultimately be responsible for your actions or inactions: legally, morally, physically, and psychologically; to the courts of the land, to your community, your friends, your family, to yourself, and to the others who may be affected by your actions or inactions, along with their families and friends. \nSo in effect, the best defense is to avoid conflict as much as possible.\n\nJust some food for thought... Let me know what you think.', ''),

(618765, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;456571]Oh no bro, I''m not against thy at all :) \nI don''t know about 1stranger bro, but I was referring to your literal holster. What I meant was, don''t let the presence of others cloud your judgement. Do not open fire just because you have a girl next to you, and you think she expects you to do so. No matter how immasculating you think it may be, your obligation is to do what it takes to get out of the situation without firing a shot; be it retreating, apologizing, handing over money, possessions, crying, even begging. If all else fails and bodily harm is imminent, [I]then[/I], do what you feel you must do to protect yourself. Indeed, others have no right to rob you, but you have even less of a right to be the judge, jury, and executioner of their actions on the spot.\n\nOf course those are just my own values and beliefs. You may wish to take them into account, maybe not. But no matter, when you point a gun at somebody, you are effectively holding a human life in your hands. However you feel about it and what your values are, it''s not an easy decision to make... imagine having to make it in a split second. \n\nAlso regardless of values and beliefs on the subject, the following advice is universal...\nI don''t know if any classes are available to you, that teach the legal and moral obligations of carrying a firearm for protection, and the legal and moral ramifications of actually using it; but if there is, take it, if there isn''t, research it (in depth) yourself. Then, take a class that teaches you how to use a gun in that role ie. concealed carry by a civilian for personal protection. Then, practice, train, practice, and train. That can not be emphasized enough. Because as stated in your op, there is good reason to believe you are at increased risk for a personal security breach. So if the potential is likely there, you want to have as many decisions made before hand as possible. That is, God forbid it ever happens, but should it come to that, you want to know what you are going to do, as much as possible. \n\nBut remember, no matter what you decide, you will ultimately be responsible for your actions or inactions: legally, morally, physically, and psychologically; to the courts of the land, to your community, your friends, your family, to yourself, and to the others who may be affected by your actions or inactions, along with their families and friends. \nSo in effect, the best defense is to avoid conflict as much as possible.\n\nJust some food for thought... Let me know what you think.[/QUOTE]\n\nOh. Heheh. May have overplayed my hand there by misunderstanding the comment. Whoops.\n\nNo, I totally agree with what you say. Like I said earlier, I have considered the scenarios where guns come into play. A woman''s words -- or anyone else''s for that matter -- have no bearing on that use scenario. \n\nSome questions are a bit daunting. How does one differentiate between an armed robbery (NO justification for gun use) and a kidnapping attempt? I have a friend who was kidnapped in the recent past, a high profile case with all the political backing one could imagine, who has yet to emerge after three years. As hard as it is to come to terms with, few of us are under the impression that he is still alive and will ever be recovered. In such a situation, how can one be sure? How can one know that ''okay, this will at most be a ransom case, so no need to use violent force'', versus ''there is no way I emerge from this alive''?\n\nI don''t think any amount of specialized training that may be on offer in Pakistan (I doubt there is any at all) could prepare one for the decisive moment mentioned above, for example.\n\nWhat I leave that to is some hope that the human mind and survival instinct kick in at such points and allow one to make better decisions than one would otherwise imagine.\n\nBut again, I don''t know, and I hope never to find out.\n\nIt''s a sticky situation, gun ownership, and as you say, requires all sorts of thought and protocols, not unlike the game theoretical analysis that goes into a country''s nuclear doctrine (which, as a political science student in college, would fascinate me). Again, one can put in all kinds of thought but I think the decisive moment is that unfortunate moment alone, and that''s where I can hope that survival instinct and adrenaline and what have you lead to heightened awareness and better decision making.\n\nMany times, while thinking these things through, I''ve wondered whether I''d like to carry a gun at all. The responsibility of doing so, the consequences, all can be overwhelming. But at the end of the day, the pros seem to outweigh the cons. I would not be able to forgive myself if I were in a situation where a gun would have given me a fighting chance of saving a loved one''s life, only because, like an ostrich with its head burrowed in the sand, I refused to deal with the overwhelming responsibility of ownership.', ''),
(618766, ' I''d like to add, the evolving (devolving?) situation in Pakistan only makes things scarier. I don''t know whether it''s alarmist parents trying to dissuade their children from unnecessary risks, but many elders with political/military/security backgrounds repeatedly mention evolving tactics being used by extremist outfits who find their funding sources dwindling and relying upon ransom for new channels of income. And we all know the threat of recent military operations forcing extremist activity closer to home, in urban centers that have thus far been relatively insulated.\n\nAnyhow, it is what it is. Where rationale and logic fail to provide answers, one has no choice but to turn to Providence and Fate. \n\nFudgepacker, where in Canada are you based? I was in Ottawa for my last two years of high school, before going on to college in the US.

(618801, 'Coping with Cops: An incident I have been carrying on and off sporadically for the past few years. Sometimes with a 144 permit and sometimes without. When finally my luck ran out. \n\nI was stopped late night, last week near Karachi&#8217; s 2  swords roundabout. I was alone and carrying my NP 42 chambered with the hammer down safety off. \n\nI immediately declared that I had a licensed loaded fire arm and it was resting in the door sleeve. \nI asked the cop if he wanted to see the license or the weapon first. The cop asked for the license. And after handing it over I took out my weapon and told him that I am unloading it. And once unloaded handed it over. \n\nHe checked it, saw that it was registered at the local PS and the license itself was up to date, computerized and issued by the home department with the relevant bank stamps. Saw that the weapon was purchased through an authorized fire arms dealer whose purchase receipt was also attached. \n\nHe then asked me for a section 144 permit. I was not in possession of the requisite document since such permits are not currently being issued by the Home department Sindh. \n\nTo which he replied it was not really his fault and said section has been imposed and it is his duty to see the law is implemented. He then proceeded to inform me that  I would have my mobile phone confiscated and should spend the night in the police lockup and have to pay Rs. 60,000 to clear up the charges.\n\nThat struck me as a trifle high so we started the (somewhat) arduous process of negotiation right there on the road. After an hour I had whittled it down from 60,000 to Rs. 6000. And then they accompanied me to the nearest ATM Machine,. I tried to take out the amount.. And the machine broke down.  I tired a couple of times and indicated my helplessness. So they took me to another ATM.  At Ocean Mall this time. There was a huge barrier there. \n\nI was like: &#8220;what do you expect me to do. Clamber over or crawl under&#8221;? \n\nBy which time we were all pretty exhausted and they said just forget it and hand over what ever you have in your wallet. I said Rs. 2500. I was wrong.  I Had Rs. 1750. They took Rs. 1500 and then the started telling me his life story.  How he had been posted in the crime infested Lyari area and had survived 5 years there to get a relatively cushy posting in the Boat Basin Police station.  \n\nAnother one was openly contemptuous of the gangsters in Karachi who have killed almost 200 cops in Karachi in this year alone. He opined that if he has to die he will do so but with a gun in his hand and take a few with him. \nThe one who had stopped me then showed me his most priced possession.  A Chinese TT Type 636 old Model.  Unfortunately it jammed after firing only one round. \n \nI promised to find the best TT gunsmith in the market and let me know and took his number. \nTowards the end the cops (around 8 of them, all constables without even a head constable amongst the lot) were quite apologetic and offered to return the amount they had taken but with around 7 or 8 of them Rs. 1500 was one decent meal each. Which I figured they deserved since I really did not have a section 144 permit while the section has been imposed in the city (since infinity) \n\nTailpeice: Till the Home department either dispenses with the afore mentioned section or starts issuing permits, its better not to carry firearms.   \n\nOther then that the cops are doing a really difficult job trying to fight crime in a city bursting at the seams with around 20 million souls. Almost 200 of them have lost their lives fighting crime in this year alone.  Talk to them&#8230; Treat them like human beings. That&#8217;s pretty much what some of them want.', '');

The Soviet Union continued developing methods to make steel cases, and eventually a large portion of Soviet ammunition was steel cased.\n\n Meanwhile, sometime in the 1970s as far as I can tell, the Koreans developed the aluminum case for various pistol calibers.  I think the Russians are making some aluminum case ammunition now, but what we see where I live is all Korean.\n\n The steel and aluminum cases are all Berdan primed and non-reloadable.  Not that Berdan cases can''t be reloaded, but Berdan primers simply aren''t available in the USA any more, plus there are at least a dozen different sizes to deal with, vs. four Boxer primers. \n\n Probably only a few percent of American shooters reload, but they''re a big enough market that fired brass cases are often worth 10% or so of the price of a loaded round; if you save your brass and sell it, it''ll pay for every tenth or dozenth box of new ammunition.\n\n Plus, "Brass!

(618822, ' [QUOTE=Taimur Malik;456588]\nSome questions are a bit daunting. How does one differentiate between an armed robbery (NO justification for gun use) and a kidnapping attempt?  ...How can one know that ''okay, this will at most be a ransom case, so no need to use violent force'', versus ''there is no way I emerge from this alive''?\n\nI don''t think any amount of specialized training that may be on offer in Pakistan (I doubt there is any at all) could prepare one for the decisive moment mentioned above, for example.\n\nWhat I leave that to is some hope that the human mind and survival instinct kick in at such points and allow one to make better decisions than one would otherwise imagine...[/QUOTE]\nWell, regardless of others opinions on what constitutes a justified response in the event of a kidnapping, but that is something you must decide for yourself. But, I gotta tell you, when the adrenaline is flowing is the worst time to make important decisions. I''ll tell you why... Ever heard of tunnel vision? That''s the most common example most people are familiar with, when they''re about to get into a car accident, they see a plate about to fall, when a something is thrown at them, etc. They focus in on one thing and lose sight of everything else. And that''s just a result of light-medium stress levels. When under extreme stress, your body and mind reacts in a lot of strange ways. You see less, but you see further. You lose fine motor skills, but gain strength in gross motor skills. You feel less pain, but lose awareness. You think less, but react faster. However, the most detrimental effect of stress is, you actually become [I]dumber[/I]. Studies showed that people under stress actually score lower in iq testing. That''s why I say, as much as possible, know what you are going to do before the shtf. You''re are absolutely right that its impossible to be completely prepared for everything that could happen in a crisis situation. But, prepare for what you would/could do: if someone attacked your strong side; be proficient at defending/shooting with your weak hand. If you hear invaders in your home in the middle of the night; prepare a safe room or an exit have a gun to your head; will you surrender? If so, have a plan for that too; will you expose your weapon, will you hand over your wallet, will your id be in your wallet, will you have a "dummy wallet", will you hand over your phone, can the bg''s locate your friends and family with that phone... In those situations, forget about making the wrong decision, just taking the time to think, "what am I going to do now...", could mean the difference between life and death. Anyways, that is what I mean and why I say, do as much decision making as you can beforehand, then if/when the time comes, all you have to do is react.', ''),

(618830, ' [QUOTE=Taimur Malik;456393]Dear all,\n\nI have been a silent observer of this forum for a few years now, and very regularly over the past few months.\n\nBy virtue of my father being a retired bureaucrat and his terminal post and post-retirement job, as well as my employment for a US multinational, exposing him and us (his family) to a number of ongoing security threats, we recently acquired three licenses each for personal protection purposes. These were applied for in June and received in July.\n\nI am now at a loss as to what exactly to procure, and would greatly appreciate the help of the experts on this forum.\n\nBased on extensive online research, I have narrowed it down as follows:\n\nLicense #1: 12-gauge shotgun under my name\n- Beretta A400 Xplor Unico already procured under the advice of keen hunter friends\n- Will be used for the occasional hunt and home defense purposes\n\nLicense #2: 12-gauge shotgun under my father''s name\n- Thinking of importing with FBR clearance an AyA SxS\n- For the very occasional hunt, although really for the aesthetic value and heirloom purposes\n- If FBR clearance is not forthcoming, I am thinking of a Beretta O/U or SxS. This will be a present to my father from me, so I have no issue spending ''big bucks'', in the range of 500K+ depending on the quality of what''s available\n\nLicense #3: 9mm handgun under my name\n- Thinking of either Glock 17/19, Beretta 92FS, CZ P-01, or SIG P226\n- Budget around 350K\n- This will be for defensive carry in the car on occasions where I feel necessary (traveling with female friends, late night driving, etc.), and most importantly, for when I go hiking -- I would like the gun to be visible as a deterrent against anyone who thinks here''s a poor rich city boy who we can rob or kidnap at will. I am NOT into concealed carry, so while light weight would be nice to keep hiking pack loads down, it is not critical.\n- I am in love with the looks and heritage of a Beretta 92FS, have great respect for Glocks for their uncomplicated operation and minimal looks, revere the SIG for its mythic status, and respect the CZ for not making me feel like an idiot paying 3-5x the actual retail on the other guns.\n\nLicense #4: 9mm handgun under my father''s name\n- Budget around 250K\n- This will be entirely for self defence purposes. Will probably be kept at home throughout its life by my father, in some drawer somewhere, and hardly if ever taken to a range\n- For this reason, I am thinking of a low-maintenance easy to use revolver\n- I would like a Smith & Wesson but am not sure of availability of new models in Pakistan. If a revolver is not available, then I''m thinking of a relatively low-cost CZ, e.g. 75B\n- As I understand it, changing from a 9mm to a typical revolver bore should not be problematic\n\nLicense #5: .22 rifle under my name\n- Budget around 250K\n- This will be used for target practice at the range since no larger rifles are allowed at LRC, and the occasional hunt, as well as to prepare myself for a larger bore rifle on more serious hunts (see below)\n- I would like a bolt action for the simplicity/heritage of the action design\n- I am not sure what is available in the market, but would like the best within my budget\n\nLicense #6: .22 rifle under my father''s name\n- Budget around 350K\n- This will be used very very occasionally for big-game hunting should the opportunity ever present itself, and otherwise for heirloom purposes. As I understand it, one can change the license to other bores (e.g. .243. 30-06, 7mm)\n- Which of the above bores should one get for big-game hunting?\n- I have a soft-spot for CZ 550, but would absolutely love to get my hands on a Remington or Winchester in one of the above bores\n\nMany thanks for your help.

(619020, 'I never understood shotguns.*may later turn into a beginners guide to shotties* I never understood shotguns,whereas cartridges are simple. Can someone explain them to me?\n\nIll keep this in nice bullet points. Two parts, one to tell you what i can make of it, and the second filled with questions. \n\n- Shotgun barrel diameters are measured in gauges, which are a reference to the weight of a lead ball that is needed to perfectly fit the barrel. \n- they come in smoothbore and rifled. Firing slugs out of a smoothbore is not a good idea, and vice versa with pellets and rifled barrels. \n- the ammo available for them are = slugs, sabot slugs, shotshells, beanbag rounds, salt rounds and dragonfire rounds, along with other hand loaded/ factory made exotic ammo. \n- chokes are used to control the spread of the pellets. \n\nNow the Q and A\n- People say 12 ga buckshot. But 12 ga is the size of teh barrel. What do they mean? that the SIZE of the buckshot pellets are 12ga? or the buckshot pellets are in a shell sized for 12ga shotguns,( if so, where do they identify the size of the buckshot? ) \n\n- why do shotguns all look the same? The barrel holding the tube, and the other barrel on top, and the middle portion ( the action/slide) all look pretty much the same. What makes one pump shottie worth 60k and the other worth 150k, and the mechanical design is mostly the same, then why? brand name? I understand the extra price for semi autos, and tac shotties, but all pumps look nearly identical, hell, you could draw a basic outline of the action of one shotgun, and i bet you all the pump shotguns you put on it will stay within the borders of that outline. Whats up with that? There is more variance in pistols then that. \n- how does the sizing of buckshot and birdshot work? along with slugs? are slugs only defined by their caliber/gauge/bore size?\n- Do normal slugs contact the barrel and then impart a spin on the slug? Or are they ment to be used in smoothbore-close range only?\n- are sabot slugs smaller then the barrel, so only the sabot makes contact and turns itself and the slug, or are sabot slugs the same size and they both contact the rifling. \n- where does the choke fit?\n- why are shotgun shells made of plastic instead of..metal? I mean, there is still a gunpowder boom going on,why dont they burst/melt .....?\n- why do we still store ammo in tubes, when its obviously easier to use a magazine box?\n- why do all the shotguns have a rail of metal with holes in it, sparingly running alongside the top of the barrel?\n- what is the point of a wad in a slug?', ''),

(619074, ' Let''s see if we can simplify things a little... First of all, twist does not affect speed or power,or aerodynamics of the bullet. For a given caliber, the first two factors are varied by powder charge along with bullet weight, and aero, or ballistic coefficient, is varied by sectional density (weight distribution), along with the shape and size of the bullet''s frontal area. However, for a given bullet weight, bullet size, and bullet speed, you want a "twist rate" to match. Twist rates are either "fast" or "slow". They are expressed in a ratio eg. 1:9 (one in nine) or 1:14 (one in fourteen). The first number is always a "1", for one complete revolution. The second number indicates how many inches it takes to make that one revolution. 1:9 means it takes 9 inches to for the bullet to spin once, a relatively fast rate. 1:14 means 14 inches to make a complete revolution; taking 5 more inches, it would be considered a slower rate than 1:9.\n\nSo what? If it doesn''t increase speed, and doesn''t increase power, doesn''t increase aero, whats it for? If you''ve ever thrown an American football, you''ll already know the answer. Like a bullet, the football is shaped with an "ogive", or pointed front. If you''ve thrown a football, you know what happens if you don''t put a good spin on it... it wobbles. Rifling twist stabilizes the bullet so that it can travel straight.\n\nFor heavier bullets, you want a faster rate. Longer bullets also require a faster rate, and slower bullets require a faster rate. So why don''t manufacturers just always cut their barrels with really fast rates? Because too much spin will destabilize the bullet, just as not enough spin. So why do manufacturers sometimes make the same gun, in the same caliber, with different twist rates? So that different people may use the same gun and caliber combo for different purposes. Take an AR for example; for competition, I''d use ammo with a very light charge, just enough to cycle the action. That reduces recoil, allowing the rifle to get back on target quicker, and making it easier to shoot more accurately. But with so little powder, that means I also have to use a very light 30grain bullet, which works best with slow 1:14 twist rifling. On the other hand, guys who hunt with their AR''s generally prefer a much heavier bullet, which necessitates a faster twist rate, like a 1:9.\n\nAnyways, hope that helped!', ''),

(619134, ' [QUOTE=Fudgepacker;456893]Let''s see if we can simplify things a little... First of all, twist does not affect speed or power,or aerodynamics of the bullet. For a given caliber, the first two factors are varied by powder charge along with bullet weight, and aero, or ballistic coefficient, is varied by sectional density (weight distribution), along with the shape and size of the bullet''s frontal area. However, for a given bullet weight, bullet size, and bullet speed, you want a "twist rate" to match. Twist rates are either "fast" or "slow". They are expressed in a ratio eg. 1:9 (one in nine) or 1:14 (one in fourteen). The first number is always a "1", for one complete revolution. The second number indicates how many inches it takes to make that one revolution. 1:9 means it takes 9 inches to for the bullet to spin once, a relatively fast rate. 1:14 means 14 inches to make a complete revolution; taking 5 more inches, it would be considered a slower rate than 1:9.\r\n\r\nSo what? If it doesn''t increase speed, and doesn''t increase power, doesn''t increase aero, whats it for? If you''ve ever thrown an American football, you''ll already know the answer. Like a bullet, the football is shaped with an "ogive", or pointed front. If you''ve thrown a football, you know what happens if you don''t put a good spin on it... it wobbles. Rifling twist stabilizes the bullet so that it can travel straight.\r\n\r\nFor heavier bullets, you want a faster rate. Longer bullets also require a faster rate, and slower bullets require a faster rate. So why don''t manufacturers just always cut their barrels with really fast rates? Because too much spin will destabilize the bullet, just as not enough spin. So why do manufacturers sometimes make the same gun, in the same caliber, with different twist rates? So that different people may use the same gun and caliber combo for different purposes. Take an AR for example; for competition, I''d use ammo with a very light charge, just enough to cycle the action. That reduces recoil, allowing the rifle to get back on target quicker, and making it easier to shoot more accurately. But with so little powder, that means I also have to use a very light 30grain bullet, which works best with slow 1:14 twist rifling. On the other hand, guys who hunt with their AR''s generally prefer a much heavier bullet, which necessitates a faster twist rate, like a 1:9.\r\n\r\nAnyways, hope that helped![/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBravo. +1 well explained . but twist dose not have to do any thing !

Before that, we did a lot of practice with Vepr to understand recoil, grip, impact, point of aim etc. But you are rights, accidents do happen as this is a bit more risky sports/hobby.', ''),

NO, bcz it looses its  trajactory quickly than 5.65x45s , same is the case with .22lrs and 9mms  .22lrs are known for there straight path if you got some good rifle you  can shot somebody at 300 with some skill, but with 9mm it will be very  tricky only competitve shooters which have great skill and thousands of  hours of practice can do that ,\n\nwe can all take this discusion  long and long and long. Most of us will be logical and correct in there  views, but i will say this that we should be serious about a bullet  either it is 9mm or .22lr or .223 - 7.62x38s every single bullet is  desighned for only one purpose and that is to kill yes each and every  one of them is different and every bullet is suitable for differnt  conditions but they are dangerous all of them and please don''t  underestimate any round, we all have choices according to our  requirements but If somebody asks me of which round we should generaly  afraid off:\nthen i will say the round which has hitted you......\n\nI am done .........', ''),

Although I (as Deathrow and Ed have advised me) wanted to get a NP-42 (the Norinco thing), but somehow a friend sent me in this thing. Said it''s one of the best handguns I can lay my hands on. It has been used for 2 years and the fella said it never gave him any ftf/e or misfire probs. I asked him the price but he says I should enquire it''s price from people who know about guns and then pay him whatever I think is a reasonable price :S\n\nThe weight (empty mag loaded) is around 700g or so (I haven''t weighed it, just telling my estimate of it''s weight). It fits in my hand easily (although I can''t swing it like a sword. what a shame!) and the bolt sliding and all is also easy. Although the trigger is hard for my choice, but it is smooth from start of the pull to the release. I have shot it "dry" a few times, but haven''t banged it yet.\n\n1- So. First off. Tell me what is it called because I don''t know shit about it, except that I am supposed to carry it around at night and should pull it out in case of an urgency, instead of the trusty sword *sob sob*.\n\n2- Also tell me it''s caliber and how much would it''s ammo cost me.\n\n3- Plus, what is the "reasonable" price for it, considering it has been used for 2 years. I took the pics in a haste, without cleaning it first, so it looks rather older than it really is.\n\n4- Oh and what about it''s ammo price and availability? Sorry I forgot to take pics of it''s bullets. If required, I will post a couple pics tomorrow.\n\n5- Can / should I trust it in times of urgency? Would this be a better choice for personal safety (CC at night) or the NP-42, as advised by Ed and Deathrow?

In other areas the TT-33 differs more from Browning''s designs &#8212; it employs a much simpler hammer/sear assembly than the M1911, with an external hammer.\n\nAnother copy by Germans:\nThe Wehrmacht captured a fair number of TT-33s and issued them to units under the Pistole 615(r) designation. This was made possible by the fact that Russian 7.62 mm Model 1930 Type P cartridges were nearly identical to the German 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge. Therefore German ammunition could be used in captured Russian arms, and vice versa. Due to much higher pressures, the Russian cartridges should never be used in the German Mauser pistols. Such use could be very dangerous.\n\n[B]Chinesse complete reverse enginering:[/B]\n\n"Production in China\n\nThe TT pistol was copied in China as the Type 51, Type 54,[6] M20, and TU-90.\n\nNorinco, the People''s Liberation Army''s state weapons manufacturer in China, manufactured a commercial variant of the Tokarev pistol chambered in the more common 9×19mm Parabellum round, known as the Tokarev Model 213, as well as in the original 7.62×25mm caliber."\n\nsource:         [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TT_pistol[/url]\n\nNow remains american POW''s mystery i will track it down too just wait .........', ''),

This was made possible by the fact that Russian 7.62 mm Model 1930 Type P cartridges were nearly identical to the German 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge. Therefore German ammunition could be used in captured Russian arms, and vice versa. Due to much higher pressures, the Russian cartridges should never be used in the German Mauser pistols.

(619424, ' [QUOTE=D3AD!;457144]Here you go brother:\r\n\r\nDesign details:\r\nExternally, the TT-33 is very similar to John Browning''s blowback operated FN Model 1903 automatic pistol, and internally it uses Browning''s short recoil dropping-barrel system from the M1911 pistol. In other areas the TT-33 differs more from Browning''s designs — it employs a much simpler hammer/sear assembly than the M1911, with an external hammer.\r\n\r\nAnother copy by Germans:\r\nThe Wehrmacht captured a fair number of TT-33s and issued them to units under the Pistole 615(r) designation. This was made possible by the fact that Russian 7.62 mm Model 1930 Type P cartridges were nearly identical to the German 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge. Therefore German ammunition could be used in captured Russian arms, and vice versa. Due to much higher pressures, the Russian cartridges should never be used in the German Mauser pistols. Such use could be very dangerous.\r\n\r\n[B]Chinesse complete reverse enginering:[/B]\r\n\r\n"Production in China\r\n\r\nThe TT pistol was copied in China as the Type 51, Type 54,[6] M20, and TU-90.\r\n\r\nNorinco, the People''s Liberation Army''s state weapons manufacturer in China, manufactured a commercial variant of the Tokarev pistol chambered in the more common 9×19mm Parabellum round, known as the Tokarev Model 213, as well as in the original 7.62×25mm caliber."\r\n\r\nsource:         [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TT_pistol[/url]\r\n\r\nNow remains american POW''s mystery i will track it down too just wait .........[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nI wouldn''t say that''s a direct branch off, most, scratch that almost all center fire pistols use Browning''s short recoil and tilt barrel designs. Thats like saying the cz 75 and glocks is based on the 1911, in reality they only share the actions designed by our dear Mr. Browning, the short recoil and tilted barrel autoloading designs.', ''),

In otherwords, if you took lead balls for a 12 gauge gun, it would take twelve of them to make up one pound.', ''),

The manufacturing tech for it like casting drilling was already widespread, at most they just had to slap the cheapest suitable alloy for the pistol, something that they already have quite ample know lage about by making their own guns. \n\nIf its a electronic device then just to make a copy , much effort is needed.

(619523, ' [QUOTE=atiq;324602]let me give you a simpler answer. CF98 has a trigger system that is intended for plain shooting if the need be for defense and NOT for Practical shooting let alone when you are practicing calling shots. Too much slap, too much disengaging travel, too much over travel. It would be the same as testing a mehran car on a f1 track. What would you get out of testing such a car?? all the results will only show that it is working perfectly for a normal person.\n\nIPSC is the F1 racing (best car with best driver and tactics) with multiple calibers and highly tuned normal guns available for carry as well; and target shooting Olympics style is like Drag race (dedicated weapons such as Hammerli 208s) where the gun matters a lot and only small calibers are used.\n\nNP22 is a regular military gun design, and we use it to learn high end things; kam kharch bala nashin.. at 1000 rounds the gun has removed all the creep in the trigger and works smoothly, though it needs cleaning at every 300 rounds or so, so that the buildup of carbon doesnt start to create crud and act as emery IF you want your gun to reach 15000 rounds and LOOK as if IN top condition and resale isn''t diminished to such an event that the guns is worthless piece of junk.\n\nIF the factory itself admits that the gun life is 10000 rounds then they are implicitly saying that it is NOT intended for heavy use and is for occassional use. Whereas NP22 as i have seen is well worth the amount of money you put in.\nTHERE is NO comparision between CF 98 and NP22; absolutely NO comparision and doing it would make one wonder am i doing something that is within the lines of sanity.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=HelveticaNeue]First of all my SALAM to all the respected members of this blog........

(619628, ' [QUOTE=Enigmatic Desires;456622]I have been carrying on and off sporadically for the past few years. Sometimes with a 144 permit and sometimes without. When finally my luck ran out. \n\nI was stopped late night, last week near Karachi’ s 2  swords roundabout. I was alone and carrying my NP 42 chambered with the hammer down safety off. \n\nI immediately declared that I had a licensed loaded fire arm and it was resting in the door sleeve. \nI asked the cop if he wanted to see the license or the weapon first. The cop asked for the license. And after handing it over I took out my weapon and told him that I am unloading it. And once unloaded handed it over. \n\nHe checked it, saw that it was registered at the local PS and the license itself was up to date, computerized and issued by the home department with the relevant bank stamps. Saw that the weapon was purchased through an authorized fire arms dealer whose purchase receipt was also attached. \n\nHe then asked me for a section 144 permit. I was not in possession of the requisite document since such permits are not currently being issued by the Home department Sindh. \n\nTo which he replied it was not really his fault and said section has been imposed and it is his duty to see the law is implemented. He then proceeded to inform me that  I would have my mobile phone confiscated and should spend the night in the police lockup and have to pay Rs. 60,000 to clear up the charges.\n\nThat struck me as a trifle high so we started the (somewhat) arduous process of negotiation right there on the road. After an hour I had whittled it down from 60,000 to Rs. 6000. And then they accompanied me to the nearest ATM Machine,. I tried to take out the amount.. And the machine broke down.  I tired a couple of times and indicated my helplessness. So they took me to another ATM.  At Ocean Mall this time. There was a huge barrier there. \n\nI was like: “what do you expect me to do. Clamber over or crawl under”? \n\nBy which time we were all pretty exhausted and they said just forget it and hand over what ever you have in your wallet. I said Rs. 2500. I was wrong.  I Had Rs. 1750. They took Rs. 1500 and then the started telling me his life story.  How he had been posted in the crime infested Lyari area and had survived 5 years there to get a relatively cushy posting in the Boat Basin Police station.  \n\nAnother one was openly contemptuous of the gangsters in Karachi who have killed almost 200 cops in Karachi in this year alone. He opined that if he has to die he will do so but with a gun in his hand and take a few with him. \nThe one who had stopped me then showed me his most priced possession.  A Chinese TT Type 636 old Model.  Unfortunately it jammed after firing only one round. \n \nI promised to find the best TT gunsmith in the market and let me know and took his number. \nTowards the end the cops (around 8 of them, all constables without even a head constable amongst the lot) were quite apologetic and offered to return the amount they had taken but with around 7 or 8 of them Rs. 1500 was one decent meal each. Which I figured they deserved since I really did not have a section 144 permit while the section has been imposed in the city (since infinity) \n\nTailpeice: Till the Home department either dispenses with the afore mentioned section or starts issuing permits, its better not to carry firearms.   \n\nOther then that the cops are doing a really difficult job trying to fight crime in a city bursting at the seams with around 20 million souls. Almost 200 of them have lost their lives fighting crime in this year alone.  Talk to them… Treat them like human beings. That’s pretty much what some of them want.[/QUOTE]\n\ni bet brother even if you got that permit, They still had taken the money out of your wallet any other way, as they have thousands of lame drama and excuses which they use to harress inocent citizens', ''),

(619731, ' I just went through a big process choosing chokes. If you can get Briley''s, I''d highly recommend them. They have a very even pattern distribution and proper constriction. I did a lot of research, and tried a lot of different chokes in different shotguns. Ill share a couple other things I learned. First, whichever choke company you go with, make sure the constriction is listed. Determine the pattern you want, then choose a choke according to the constriction that gives that pattern. Do not just go by whether its called a full, modified, or IC, etc. Heres how I learned this... I had a light modified I was using on my Beretta, and I really liked the pattern it put out. So, I wanted the same for my Remington. I went to the store and asked them for a light mod, but they only had Remchoke in modified, so I figured it would be close enough and took it. Later, upon closer inspection, I saw that the modified Remchoke only had 0.006" constriction, whereas the light mod Briley''s choke on the Beretta had 0.016". So, a choke that was supposed to be tighter by name, was actually looser in actual constriction. Needless to say, I returned the Remchoke and ordered the Briley''s that I wanted in the first place. \n\nSecond thing I learned has to do with porting. Ported chokes cost a little bit more, and some companies make wild claims of reduced reoil, less muzzle rise, how it "catches" the wad to produce a better pattern, whatever. However, others say they have no noticable effect on performance, but it is offered simply as a style choice. After trying the same extended chokes, one ported and one not, I tend to agree with the latter. I must admit they do look cool, however, they are a major pain to clean. \n\nAt  the end of the day, the best advice I can give is, just pattern your gun. That is, shoot at paper from different distances to make sure you have the spread that you want. Different chokes can have different points of impact. Different brands produce different patterns. Same size choke, same brand, in a different gun can also produce totally different results. Also keep in mind that a shot pattern is 3 dimensional, an aspect that is lost on paper patterns. Anyways, whether your hunting birds or shooting trap, investing in a quality choke can go a long way, good luck finding what you want!', ''),

He charged me only one thousand rupees extra for entry in the  deputy commissioner''s office. My license'' details are as follows:\n\nPage 1: A round national bank stamp with some initials with a red pen and a separate date stamp by the national bank.\n\nPage 2: A black book number stamp, license No: DC/ South/****/**, Date of issue (the back date), and District: South.\n\nOn the page adjacent to page 12 in license, a big round stamp of Deputy Commisioner South Karachi, on my photo.\n\nPage 19: Stamp bearing the name and designation of Additional deputy commissioner II, South, karachi. Another stamp saying Home secretary quota. A third stamp saying Fees paid, Challan No.****, valid upto 31-12-2013.\n\nPage 22 (Renewal): National bank renewal stamp, another stamp bearing the date, a number by the bank with a red pen( the same number which they also write on challans) and initials with a red pen.                                                 \nHe also took me to the home department  for computerization of the license where they took my photo and  fingerprints on digital fingerprint machine and issued me a computer  generated slip. He asked me if I was in a hurry for the computerized license and I told him ''no''.  He said they were busy computerizing licenses of important people and I needed not worry. Hopefully, I will get mine soon. By the way, I had never requested him to get me a license.
