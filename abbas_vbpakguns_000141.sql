The shotgun incorporates decades of Beretta’s experience perfecting the gas operated semi-automatic design. The reduced felt recoil is complemented by the infallible reliability Beretta shotguns are known for. THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR HOME/SELF DEFENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES The very light and compact TX4, with its 18.5” barrel, is very maneuverable, while maintaining a 5+1 round capacity. Like the CX4, the shotgun’s length of pull may be adjusted with ½” spacers (one included), while the soft rubber grip inlays on the stock and fore-end ensure firm grip in all situations. A metal Picatinny rail is mounted to the receiver to accept your optics or the included rugged and fully adjustable ghost ring sight. Adopting Beretta’s new Optima-Bore HP and Optima-Choke HP choke tube system, the included choke may be replaced with several optional accessories. Like the rest of the Storm family, the TX4 may be accessorized to meet the demanding needs of today’s shooter. Button operated on trigger guard; ambidextrous/reversible. Rear sight adjustable in elevation and windage, protected. Removable from Picatinny rail. Front sight, protected, fixed on the barrel. \r\n\r\n[url]http://www.beretta.com/Defence-Pistols-Carbines/Defence-Shotgun/Tx4-Storm/index.aspx?m=82&f=2&idv=46&idc=208&id=1275#cps[/url]', ''),

Mod choke se to quail gets burst in air, and more choke is even devastating on the bird in terms of meat damage. Hitting the target is no big issue, the right and i wd call it OPTIMUM pattern at the reqd range is the issue. Quail''s best shotshell is #8 reg and the best overall choke is IC though three chokes are ok for it: Skeet, IC, LM..last being Light Modified i.e. Skeet 2. One can use as per shooting range experienced at field. My experience is that if one attempts regularly longer shots too, don''t go beyond Skeet 2 choke bec that damages badly meat at closer ranges even with #8 regular cartrdge.', ''),

I bought an uncle mike holster with it. I learned to rapid firing and quick draw from holster and shoot from it. Now I was able to shoot 100 rounds daily and it gave me so much confidence that after that glock 21 was not an issue and I was able to hit bull&#8217;s eye.

Its what I do: literature ;)\n\nBTW, about Brutus, perhaps you wanted to suggest that his language APPEALS to the emotions? His is treachery driven by a false sense of honor. Thats a completely separate plane of unconscious we are talking about. However, being in the same vein, his language none the less does reflect his intellect and personality. The syntactical patterns Shakespeare uses for Brutus'' character, suggest conspiracy in eloquence at many levels. Harold Bloom, in his research work "Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human" suggests something along these lines as well. \n\nThe beauty is to note the hard work and research that went into the creation of Brutus'' character. His eloquence in the use of the metaphor and his dexterity with the language does reflect the refinements in his characters and his brought up in terms of scholarship.

Its what I do: literature ;)\n\nBTW, about Brutus, perhaps you wanted to suggest that his language APPEALS to the emotions? His is treachery driven by a false sense of honor. Thats a completely separate plane of unconscious we are talking about. However, being in the same vein, his language none the less does reflect his intellect and personality. The syntactical patterns Shakespeare uses for Brutus'' character, suggest conspiracy in eloquence at many levels. Harold Bloom, in his research work "Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human" suggests something along these lines as well. \n\nThe beauty is to note the hard work and research that went into the creation of Brutus'' character. His eloquence in the use of the metaphor and his dexterity with the language does reflect the refinements in his characters and his brought up in terms of scholarship.

Some reload ammo to save money, other do it to get better accuracy. There are others, like me, that reload for combination of these two reasons. Some countries do not allow the practice of ammo reloading. \r\n\r\nHand-loaded ammo is usually better than factory ammo.  With reloads, one can control many of the variables - like powder type, bullet weight and shape, primer type, bullet seating depth, uniformity of cartridge casing diameter, etc. \r\n\r\nOnce the "reloading" factory" is set up, saving come from reuse of cartridge casings and bulk purchase of cartridge components. I have a manual reloading press and dies for  7.62/.308 and 5.56/.223 rifle cartridges. I also have dies for 9mm Luger, 45 Colt, 44 magnum, .357 Magnum, 38 Special handgun cartridges.\r\n\r\nThe last batch I reloaded was 500 cartridges in 9mm Lugar.  For the price of one box of 9mm factory ammo, I can hand reload several boxes of my own. For the same amount of money, one gets to practice more on the range or hunt more in the field.', ''),

My friend jst returned from a grand duck hunt a month back from Tando, and you hv to ask him too what they bagged and what choke experience they had. It woz a phenominal bag.\r\nSecond...if u want to sell the idea that IC is good for all hunting situations then certainly a no. Geese with IC is ok enough, but Mod and IM is certainly better for shot density. ''''Shot density'''' bhi koi cheez hai besides ''''shot spread'''' which u are aiming for through IC choke. Goray ne koi research kar ke hi banayi hai yeh, as i said.\r\nThirdly....partridge with IC and 8# regular is ok for shorter distances, but above 30 yds, it gets crippled off and on, and LM or M has to be used to give that ''''shot density''''. Or other cure is to switch to #6 load with IC choke. But if u insist using IC with #8 on partridge, I will certainly rule that out as that will not give the optimum pattern at ALL ranges, you can try. I have done a lot of partridge shooting in the past ...and have experienced that several times. \r\n\r\nAs patterning is the key for different gun brands, but for Berettas, mainly with A303 & AL391 Teknys that I''m using, I hv found above rule sufficient enough in practical situations.\r\nBaqi huun tussi ''choke choke''  khedna chande ho forum te time pass waasteh teh most welcome...', ''),

(343771, ' [QUOTE=francolino;182503]Firstly....40yds shooting is quite often done in duck and geese, but partridge and quail (usually) obviously not. Ask the Sind shooters too. My friend jst returned from a grand duck hunt a month back from Tando, and you hv to ask him too what they bagged and what choke experience they had. It woz a phenominal bag.\nSecond...if u want to sell the idea that IC is good for all hunting situations then certainly a no. Geese with IC is ok enough, but Mod and IM is certainly better for shot density. ''''Shot density'''' bhi koi cheez hai besides ''''shot spread'''' which u are aiming for through IC choke. Goray ne koi research kar ke hi banayi hai yeh, as i said.\nThirdly....partridge with IC and 8# regular is ok for shorter distances, but above 30 yds, it gets crippled off and on, and LM or M has to be used to give that ''''shot density''''. Or other cure is to switch to #6 load with IC choke. But if u insist using IC with #8 on partridge, I will certainly rule that out as that will not give the optimum pattern at ALL ranges, you can try. I have done a lot of partridge shooting in the past ...and have experienced that several times. \n\nAs patterning is the key for different gun brands, but for Berettas, mainly with A303 & AL391 Teknys that I''m using, I hv found above rule sufficient enough in practical situations.\nBaqi huun tussi ''choke choke''  khedna chande ho forum te time pass waasteh teh most welcome...[/QUOTE]\n \nHun pehly chock chock hi hoigi ......\n\n\nFranci Bro, \n\ni am 100 % agreed with u. Your point is very solid and logical and one cannot argue at all. Chocks are designed for precision shooting better grouping and accuracy and surely more pallets will hit with tight patterns. Tighter the chock more dead shoots and several other positivity. Your point is unanimously agreed and no second word.\n   \nOne of my very close friend cum Mentor Col. (R) Jahangir Mirza (SSG Group & Wing Commander Sindh Rangers) he is a master hunter and i always consult him for correction of my shoots and improvements. He had also visited several time to all lakes / water of sindh including Qabool muhammad shah etc. \n\nThere are 2 to 3 shoots normally at ropes and boats. Hunters in hides ready to get them. \nIts starts with IC chocks because ducks approach u within 10-15 yards than 2nd round starts when ducks cross around 20-30 yards (MOD selection sometime). \nThe last circle 35 yards plus MOD/ FULL chocks in action. Bags 1400-1700 ducks ..... yes i am tell truth. \n\nNow here come chocks in action because things are certain usually and one has to play his role within counted ranges mostly. \n\nGora bhai mostly go for driven shots and selected birds, where ranges are almost known. Chocks certainly will come in action here. \n\nHum goora kehnda e K mallard nu 1 & 2 number maroo, Tey asi 8# mari jaa rahy aan .... Faraq e bohut sada ty oona da janab ..............\n\nWhere do we stand bro jee.................  ik teal tey ik geese dasoo kithey jaiye.

How many of them were above 30-35 yards. \nKeeping in mind 30-35 yards is a huge distance.\n\nWhat would as a senior you all will suggest common hunter to go with ????', ''),

(343890, ' Ahem ahem. :) \n\nOkay being very SIMPLE here:\n\nFirst of all, Norinco 1911s are hard to find as NIBs. Most of these I have come across around here at LHR have been used thoroughly. Secondly, the Norincos are made of recycled railroad and are very reliable no doubt, however, they are notorious for problems with barrels and slides, swinging out of battery frequently. Compared to PT-1911s, these are basic 1911 replicas of the colt series 70/80, whereas pt-1911 is a semi-custom 1911 with forged steel parts (SS Model) and lots of upgrades. \n\nSo? I guess I''ll stick with PT-1911 for its upgraded qualities and the mere fact that I can have a piece new and untouched. Period.\n\nMy two cents on the subject.\n\nRegards,\nCD.', '');

PT-1911 is currently my HD+SD+CCW (ie everything) and I have had 300 FMJs through it without a malfunction.

It was not a satisfactory military sound but became a popular commercial caliber. American companies loaded it to about 1940 and both Colt and Smith & Wesson chambered revolvers for it. Also loaded in Europe, it is now obsolete. It is often listed as the 450 short, 450 Adams or 450 Colt. A 450 Mk III was used in WWI as a reserve arm/cartridge. \r\nThe 450 Revolver cartridge was originally a black powder round loaded with 13 grains of powder and a 225-grain bullet. Smokeless loads were also manufactured. The 450 can be fired in any 455 Webley revolver, and it was often used as a light target load. It is in about the same class as the old 44 S&W Russian and makes a fairly good short-range self-defense cartridge. Ammunition can be made from cut off 45 Webley cases.', ''),

The pistol was not entirely satisfactory and was replaced by the end of WWI. The cartridge resembles the 45 ACP, but uses a very blunt-pointed bullet.\r\nThis cartridge has seen very little use in the United states, although a number of Webley pistols in this caliber were sold in military surplus stores after WWII.

Despite the different caliber designation, these two cartridges actually have the same case dimensions. They differ only in bullet diameter, type, and construction. The 476 was a black-powder cartridge and so was the 455 Mk I at its inception. However, in 1894 the propellant was changed to the then new Cordite, and after a few years, it was found the smokeless powder burned more efficiently in a shorter case. Consequently a shorter case was adopted in 1897, and this altered round was designated the 455 Revolver Mk II. This is the present 455 Webley familiar to American shooters. It has a case 0.11-inch to 0.14-inch shorter than the original round.\r\nThe 455 Colt is nothing more than the Colt commercial designation of the 455 Revolver Mk I in a somewhat improved loading. It is listed in various publications and was loaded by American companies under this name, but was discontinued in the late 1930s. It is not a Colt designed cartridge, but does have different ballistics than the British Mk I. Later, the new cartridge dimensions were adopted and this round called the 455 Colt Mk II.\r\nThe 455 Mk I, 455 Mk II, 455 Colt and the original 476 Revolver are all interchangeable and can be fired in early British service arms. The 450 Revolver cartridge can also be fired in 455 revolvers. However, the 455 Webley is the only one commercially loaded. Use the same bullet and 455 Webley loading data for any of the 455 cartridges listed here. Power and performance are the same.', ''),

It is a modification of an earlier round originally designed for black powder (455 Revolver Mk I). Modern revolvers will chamber and fire either the old or new cartridge. The 455 Webley was used officially in both WWI and WWII, although it was partly replaced by the 380/200 (38 S&W) adopted in the mid-1930s. In addition to the Webley revolver, both Colt and Smith & Wesson chambered arms for this cartridge. Ammunition was loaded by American companies up to about 1940.\r\nThe 455 Webley Revolver cartridge was never very popular or widely used in United States because standard American sporting and military arms in 45 ACP caliber were more easily obtainable. However, after WWII many obsolete 455 arms were sold at low prices, and this has changed the situation somewhat. It is better known and more widely used than previously, but most 455 revolvers have been altered to shoot the 45 ACP, using clips or the rimmed 45 Auto-Rim. The 455 Revolver is not a very satisfactory field cartridge because of the low velocity and curved trajectory. On the other hand, it has excellent short-range stopping power,being on a par, or perhaps slightly better,than the 45 ACP. It can be improved by hand loading and the use of semi-wadcutter hunting-type bullets.', ''),

(344035, '.22LR - Sorting Ammo by Weight I buy 22LR ammo in bulk packs (also called "bricks") of 500-550 cartridges with the aim to save money. Match and target ammo is expensive, in some cases very expensive. Even with the "cheap" ammo I buy, I want and can get better performance. \n\nWith rim-fire ammo almost all of the variable are in the hands of the manufacturer - primer, bullet, powder, etc. If you take a 22 cartridge apart you will notice that there is very little power - about 2 grains/129 milligrams. Most of the 22LR ammo I use have bullet weights that range from 33 grains to 40 grains.\n\nThe only practical point left for the shooter to consider is to see if there is any weight variation of the cartridges within a given pack/brick.\n\nI did this exercise by using a RCBS powder weight scale that can measure as little a 0.1 grain/6.5 milligrams. I put each cartridge on scale and weighed it. I put the weighted cartridges in batches that were .1 grain apart. Here are the results of my findings:\n\nRemington (1522) Golden Bullet 40 gr. 19 batches 1 brick\nRemington (1622) Golden Bullet 36 gr. 19 batches 1 brick\nRemington (1733) Yellow Jacket 33 gr. 35 batches  1 brick\nWinchester Xpert 22 36 grains                7 batches 2 bricks\n\nIt is interesting to note that total cartridge weight variation of the Winchester Xpert 22 ammo in two bulk packs - only 7 batches. Of these 7 batches, one batch consisted of only one cartridge. In contrast, Remington Yellow Jackets had the most variation - 35 batches.\n\nIf you do not know that the next cartridge you are about to fire has the same overall weight as the last one your fired, will the result on the target be the same? \n\nNow take the cartridges that have the same weight and see the proof on the target. You will get consistent results with cartridges that have been sorted by weight.', ''),

Do you know the resulting point of impact change at a given distance?\r\n\r\nI have a Thompson 22LR Classic with rear adjustable sight with 20 marks on the rear sight. I wanted to know the point of impact change at 60 yards if I moved the rear sight by one mark. (Later on I installed a scope on this rifle.)\r\n\r\nHere is how I calculated: With a caliper I measured the movement of the rear sight from the highest level to the lowest level. The difference between these two measurements  was 0.125 inch. Each mark on the rear sight represents 0.125/20 = 0.00625 inch.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the front sight and rear sight ("sight radius") is 15 inches. \r\n\r\nThere are 2160 inches in 60 yards. This distance equals to 2160/15 = 144 "sight radius" lengths.\r\n\r\nMultiply 0.00625 by 144 and you get 0.9 inch.

(344220, ' [B]50 Action Express ( 50 AE )[/B]\r\n\r\nThis cartridge is another development by Evan H. Whildin, Vice President of Action Arms. It was developed during during 1988 as part of a program to upgrade the performance of the semi-auto pistol through new cartridge design. The 50 AE has the same rim  diameter, case length and overall  length as the 44 Magnum. However, the base diameter is .547-inch- so like the 41 AE the 50 AE has a rebated rim. Again, the reason is so that the cartridge can be chambered in the Desert Eagle pistol without making any changes in the basic design. The pistol is already chambered for the 44 Magnum, and by retaining the same rim diameter, the change in caliber to the 50 AE will require only a new barrel. The rebated rim on the Whildin-developed cartridges is a very practical approach.\r\n The 50 AE uses a .510-inch diameter bullet weighing 300 grains. Muzzle velocity from a 10-inch pressure barrel registered from 1565 fps to 1632 fps. Because the Desert Eagle is available with a 10-inh barrel, this is pretty close to the ballistics one could expect from the production model. A 300-grain bullet at 1632 fps would develop 1792 fpe of energy, which would make the 50 AE not only the world’s most powerful auto-pistol cartridge, but also right up there as anoe of six or eight most powerful handgun cartridges available for a repeating handgun. It would be an excellent field cartridge for deer-size animals or as a backup when hunting dangerous game.', ''),

(344225, ' [QUOTE=12GAUGE;182989]Bro, a 76mm chamber would not (i''ll repeat, would not) be safe with 3.5 inch super magnum cartridges as it is only designed to be used with 3 inch magnum cartridges. therefore if you wish to use 3.5 inch super magnum cartridges you should opt for a shotgun with 89mm chamber. however this comes at a sacrifice on reliability (on lighter loads) as the increased chamber size reduces the gas pressure which inturn reduces its ability to cycle lighther loads.\r\n\r\nnow one must ask this question: how often do you plan to use 3.5 inch cartrides and how often will you be using cartridges of 3inches of less (such as 2.75 inch)? remember: almost all game/sporting cartridges available in the market are 2.75 inch cartridges. you''ll be lucky if you can get your hands on anything above 3inch. \r\n\r\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\ni am deeply grateful for such a swift & comprehensive response brother . going for a NIB baikal  mp 153 model 2010 with 76mm chamber, tomorrow INSHAALLAH', ''),

(344245, ' [B]454 Casull[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 454 Casull yet another old-timer that has been around for a number of years. Originally called the 454 Magnum Revolver, it was developed by Dick Casull and Jack Fullmer of Salt Lake City, Uttah about 1957. The first public announcement was made by P.O. Ackley in the November, 1959 issue of Guns & Ammo magazine. Solid-head 45 Colt cases and duples and triplex loads were used in the original loading. Specially-altered Colt and Ruger single-action revolvers were used in the initial development. Currently, the 454 Casull employs a simple heavy case that is a 0.10-inch longer than the standard 45 Colt, to prevent it from chambering in 45 Colt revolvers, and heavy charges of 296 or H-110 propellant. The new revolver is a five-shot single-action designed by Dick Casull and manufactured by Freedom arms Co. The revolver is made of stainless steel throughout, has a 71/2-inch barrel and weighs 50 ounces. Ammunition is is loaded and marketed by Freedom Arms Co.\r\nThe 454 Casull is primarily a field and hunting cartridge, although it will probably also find acceptance among metallic silhouette shooters. Freedom Arms loads three bullet weights: a 225-grain HP at 1740 fps; a 260-grain JSP at 1723 fps, and a 300-grain JSP at 1353 fps. These are very impressive handgun ballistics and make the 454 Casull one of the most powerful revolver cartridge available at the time. Anyone who contemplates hunting dangerous game with a handgun should give serious consideration to the 454 Casull and freedom Arms revolver. Also, for those wishing a reduced load, the standard 45 Colt can be fired in the 454 revolver. There has been a modest but persistent call for a 45 Magnum revolver ever since the 44 Magnum was introduced, the 454 certainly provides all that could be desired in that caliber. Whether the demand and sales volume will be sufficient to keep the company in business remains to be seen.', ''),

Place a mirror facing the rifle at the desired distance.

Knowing the ballistics of the 22LR high velocity ammo, I knew that the bullet will be on target at 20 yards and again at 60 yards. (Read my earlier post on this topic).\n\nFirst I aligned my scope with the mirror set at 20 yards.

How do you align (sight) the scope so it in line with the target at the distance you have in mind?\n\nPlace sand/dirt in a bag and rest your rifle on the bag. Place a mirror facing the rifle at the desired distance. Make sure the mirror surface is straight up & down and not slanted/tilted. \n\nLook through the scope and make elevation and wind adjustments on the scope until cross-hair of the scope is in line with the center of the barrel as reflected by the mirror. Do Not Shoot Live Cartridges at the Mirror !!!\n\nI aligned my scope this way on a rifle that was not the bolt-action type. I wanted to set it for 60 yards. Knowing the ballistics of the 22LR high velocity ammo, I knew that the bullet will be on target at 20 yards and again at 60 yards. (Read my earlier post on this topic).\n\nFirst I aligned my scope with the mirror set at 20 yards.

(344363, 'Do not try to catch a dropped gun article that I found reasonable so I prefer to share as well\r\nQuoted as,\r\n\r\nJeff Cooper’s four rules of firearms safety are simple. They’re also pretty ingenious in that to really ruin someone’s day, you generally have to violate more than one of them. If you peruse the news for negligent discharges (more often than not incorrectly called “accidental discharges”), they’re commonly cleaning “accidents” and holstering “accidents.” And quite a few are the result of trying to catch a dropped gun.\r\n\r\nWhether it’s guns falling from the pants of star athletes, hunters trying to catch a falling rifle, servicemen grasping the trigger of a falling gun during cleaning or someone shooting himself in a rather sensitive area because he tried to stop the descent of an unholstered pistol, these incidents, while rare, do happen.\r\n\r\nAn obvious lesson that can be learned from some of these cases is to always carry a handgun securely in a proper holster. Yet, an equally intuitive lesson can be learned from this type of incident: Do not try to catch a dropped gun.\r\n\r\nWith extremely rare exceptions, modern firearms will not discharge if they hit the ground. Hammer blocks, firing-pin blocks, transfer bars and safety notches are found, often in combination with each other, in the vast majority of modern guns. In fact, some states, like California, require drop safeties on all guns sold in the state.\r\n\r\nWhen you drop a gun, you’ve inadvertently violated Rule 2 since you cannot control the direction the muzzle is facing while gravity has its way. What you can control is not introducing even more danger to the situation.\r\n\r\nYou can make the problem much worse by trying to catch the falling firearm. Your finger may land inside the trigger guard, and you’ve now violated Rule 3 of firearms safety. That combination can be disastrous. Let the gun hit the ground. It may get a scratch on its finish, but you’ll live.\r\n\r\nWhile catching a dropped gun is clearly a violation of two of the four rules of firearms safety, it may warrant its own place in the rules to emphasize its importance. As they say, “If it saves just one life…”\r\n\r\nRule 5: Do not try to catch a dropped gun.', ''),

(344409, 'You Adjusted Your Rifle Sight/Scope at Distance of  ??? Yards - But Why? You adjusted your rifle sight/scope to hit the animal at a certain distance. How did you decide on that distance?\r\n\r\nWhen shooting paper targets, you know the distance by measuring it. When hunting in the field, the answer to this question is not so easy.\r\n\r\nFirst ask yourself - what is the size of the animal that you want to hunt? To know the hunt animal is to know the "kill-zone" of that animal.  The "kill-zone" of the animal is that vital area, if hit, will bring the animal down. Small animal like a squirrel has vital areas of about one inch. Large animal like a rabbit has vital area of about 1.5 inches.\r\n\r\nOnce you decide on the animal you want to hunt, select the ammo you will use. Look at the ballistics tables for the selected ammo and determine the distance for rifle sight/scope adjustment that will keep the bullet within the "kill-Zone". You just aim at the animal and shoot.\r\n\r\nLet us take an example, in my case jack rabbits - big desert rabbits. I use 40 grain high velocity ammo. I decided to align my scope for 60 yards. With the animal, ammo and the distance selected, I know that the "kill zone" will be from the muzzle of the barrel to a  distance of about 83 yards. The bullet will leave the barrel no more than 1.5 inches low. At a distance of 20 yards bullet will be in line with the sigh/scope. At a distance of 60 yards it will again be in line with the sight/scope.  At 83 yards it will be no more than 1.5 inches low at the far end of the "kill-zone". \r\n\r\nThere no rifle in existence that will shoot a bullet in a straight line - simple law of physics/gravity prevents this from happening.', ''),

(344422, 'Shopping for Rifle Scope? How Will You Decide Which One to Buy? What do you to look for when shopping for a Rifle Scope?\r\n\r\nYou have a rifle and want to mount a scope on it. You know your budget limit. Within that budget, you have to select one out of the many scope that may be on the market. Which one will you select?\r\n\r\nHere is how went about my selection process. My last rifle purchase was a  22LR Thompson Classic. The rifle came with an open rear sight but no scope mount. It was already  threaded for scope mount installation. I needed not only a scope but also a scope mount.\r\n\r\nMy budget at the time was 4,000 rupees - converted from US Dollars. Of this amount, I allocated 3,000 rupees for the scope and the other 1,000 rupees for the scope mount.\r\n\r\nFor this amount of money , I wanted certain features. The scope had to be a well established brand with good reviews from users. I was seeking variable power - from 3X to 9X. I did not want the objective (front lens) to be too big or a tiny one. I settled on 32mm objective. I also wanted some capability of range estimation.\r\n\r\nThis filtering brought my selection from several within my budget to just two. I settled on a Tasco 3-9X32.  Here are some "extras" that I got for the same money: Elevation and wind adjustment range of 410 - 1/4 minute clicks. Each click adjustment represents 1/4" at 100 yards at the target. This scope had the wide view - 39 yards at 3X and 13 yards at 9X at a distance of 100 yards. \r\n\r\nAnother "extra" with no extra cost was the "30/30 reticle" range-finder cross hair. The "30/30 reticle" has fine-line cross-hair in the middle and bolder cross-hair toward the edges. The finer cross-hair represents a measurement of 30 inches at 100 yards with the magnification set at 4X.  \r\n\r\nHaving purchased the scope, I started looking a very sturdy scope mount. I consulted others - to find out if the scope I bought need a "high" mount or a "regular" mount as the objective was 32 mm in diameter. I even considered a mount that would allow me to use the rear open sight that came from the factory with the rifle.\r\n\r\nI found the mounts that would fit my demand - very sturdy. But they were priced more than the price I paid for the scope itself! To stay within my budget for the scope mount,  I started searching for Chinese-made mounts. I found one of very high quality for 800 rupees.\r\n\r\nOver the many years that I have been in this hobby, I must have bought half-dozen Tasco scopes and at least a similar number of Bushnell scopes.', ''),

(344432, 'Spirit of Hunting -------  &quot; Massai &quot;  The Lion Hunters of Africa The Maasai are ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. They are among the most well known of African ethnic groups, due to their distinctive customs and dress and residence near the many game parks of East Africa\r\n\r\nThe Maasai people have viewed the killing of lions as a tradition. Historically, lion hunts were done by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, lion hunts done solo are discouraged by elders. Most hunts are now done by groups of 10 warriors. Group hunting, known in Maasai as olamayio, gives the lion population a chance to grow. Maasai customary laws prohibit killing a sick lion. The killing of lionesses is also prohibited unless provoked.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each age-set, usually after a decade, the warriors count all of their lion kills to compare them with those hunted by the former age-set in order to measure accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIt is notable that warriors do not need to attend a gym, and do not need a rifle for lion hunting. All you need is one spear and one shield. Many warriors have been lost to lions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lion spear is interesting in its size of metal blade, the weight of the wood shaft and in its over-all precise balance. The metal in the spear tip and in the butt tip is made of hand-forged steel, (which today comes from the springs of old automobiles), by a Masai craftsman. This spear measures 60-63 inches long and is extremely heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded 2 pictures of Massai hunters and their Lion Hunting Spear\r\n   \r\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1745[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1746[/ATTACH]', ''),

(344499, ' You and your friend have two different rifles. \n\nAssume you buy rifle brand XYZ Firearms, model Super 22 with serial number 1234. Also assume your friend also buys a rifle brand XYZ Firearms, model Super 22 with serial number 1235. The two rifles are similar - the only difference is serial numbers - according to factory one was built after the other one - but not true. With the same ammo you shoot both rifles. You friend also shoots booth rifles. You compare the target results. Very likely both of you got better results with one rifle (the same one rifle) than the other rifle.\n\nThe variation may be due to manufacturing tolerances and the way parts move through the factory manufacturing assembly line. Just because two rifles bear consecutive serial numbers only means that the parts bearing the serial numbers were stamped one after the other one. The receivers of the rifles came from one big bin. No one knows if the receiver bearing serial 1234 was in bin at the top or bottom of the bin. Likewise same goes for receiver with serial number 1235.  The rifle barrels were manufactured in a different process - totally different machines. No one knows if the barrel attached to receiver serial number 1234 was made before or after the one attached to receiver serial number 1235.\n\nLet us not forget that microscopic variations in cartridge chamber and the rifling (groves) in the barrel can vary the results on the target. Most 22LR rifles have a 1:16 rifling twist. This means that for ever 16 inches of bullet travel in the barrel, the bullet turns one time. \n\nHere is how to calculate the revolution per minute of a 22LR bullet that leaves the barrel at 1255 feet per second (high velocity 22LR): 12 (inches in one foot) / 16 (rifling twist ratio) X 1255 (velocity of bullet at the muzzle) X 60 (seconds in one minute) = 56,475 revolutions per minute. Knowing the bullet rpm, we can comprehend and respect how a slight variation in the barrel chamber/barrel rifling can have adverse impact on the target results.\n\nThis is my "short" answer.', ''),

(344502, ' [B]218 Bee[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 218 Bee, introduced by Winchester in 1938, was originally chambered in the Model 65 lever-action rifle, a modified and modernized version of the Model 1892. Considerable enthusiasm greeted the announcement of this cartridge, and many magazine articles were devoted to its superior killing power and range as compared to the 22 Hornet. Although criticized by many gun writers as inaccurate, some Model 65s were capable of minute-of-angle accuracy. Probably its greatest detraction was that the action did not allow top mounting and centering of a scope sight, which had to be offset to one side. After WWII, Winchester brought out their medium priced Model 43 bolt action in 218 Bee. Mechanical troubles developed in some early models, and the rifle did not achieve sufficient sales volume to continue. For a time, one or two European manufacturers, such as Sako and Kriko, furnished small Mauser-type rifles in 218 Bee. \r\nat the present time, the Kimber bolt-action is the only "full production" gun chambered for the 218 Bee, although a number of custom rifles are turned out each year. Browning is chambering their new Model 65 lever-action rifle in 218 Bee, but only 5000 rifles were be built. The 218 Bee is based on the 32-20 case necked-down to 22 caliber. Cases can be made by necking-down 25-20 or 32-20 brass, then fire forming.\r\nThe 218 Bee has a larger case and somewhat greater powder capacity than the older 22 Hornet. It provides higher velocity and a greater effective range than the Hornet, and in a good single shot or bolt-action rifle, is just as accurate. It is one of the most economical small game or varmint cartridges available. On small species it can be counted on for quick kills out to 200 yards, but on coyote, bobcat or the like, it cannot always be depended on for one-shot kills farther than 150 yards. Beyond 200 yards it tends merely to wound a large percentage of what is hit. On rabbits or other edible game it is necessary to use full-jacketed bullets or reduced loads, otherwise it is too distructive and ruins much or the meat. The Bee is easy to reload, and one can duplicate anything from the 22 Short up to and exceeding the 22 Hornet. With modern powders, the factory performance can be improved safely. By using heavier bullets of 50 or 55 grains, its killing power and range on medium-sized animals can be increased. Although still a fine cartridge and useful for many purposes, the 218 Bee has been largely replaced by 222 Remington and other modern developments. The 218 Bee, like the 22 Hornet, has a relatively mild report as compared to the larger, more powerful 22 centerfires and can be used under circumstances in which the larger cartridges would not be acceptable. It is a better performer than the 22 Hornet and its lack of popularity has always been something of a mystery.', ''),

(344523, ' [B]22 PPC[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 22 PPC was developed in 1974 by Dr. Louis Palmisano and Ferris Pindell, primarily as a benchrest cartridge. Although originally a wildcat, Sako of Finland introduced commercial rifles and ammunition late in 1987. Since it is an American development, it is listed here as a current American rifle cartridge rather than as a European cartridge. The cartridgevis based on an alteration of the 220 Russian case which, in turn, is a necked-down version of the 7.62x39mm Russian military cartridge. The Wichita Engineering and Supply Co. made the original rifles and their Classic and Varmint rifles have long been the only American-made commercial rifles to chamber both the 22 and 6mm PPC cartridges. Many custom rifles have been turned out in this caliber, often based on the short Remington 700 action, some with heavy-sleeved actions and other special features.\r\nThe originators altered the 220 Russian case by giving it a 10-degree body taper and 30-degree shoulder angle, as well as expanding the neck to accept the standard .224-inch diameter bullet used in the U.S. The cartridge cases are made in Finland by Sako and use Small Rifle primers. Although the 22 PPC is a short rather stubby case only 1.51 inches long, it nevertheless develops ballistics superior to some larger, longer cartridges such as the 222 and 223 Remington. The 52-grain bullet can be pushed out of the muzzle at over 3500 fps, and this definitely places the 22 PPC in the varmint and small game class. A 1 in 14-inch twist has become pretty much standard for these rifles.', ''),
(344524, ' [B]6mm PPC[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 6mm PPC is an outgrowth of the 22 PPC, based on the same case configuration with the neck expanded to take 6mm (.243-inch) bullets. This cartridge was also developed by Dr. Louis Palmisano and Ferris Pindell and based on the original 220 Russian case, which is itself a variation of the 7.62x39 (M43) Russian military cartridge. The original rifles were made by Wichita Engineering and supply Co. in 1975, and they manufacture the only American-made commercial rifles. Manu custom rifles have been made up in this caliber in both sporter and benchrest types. Although originally a wildcat, Sako of Finland begun turning out commercial bolt-action rifles and supplying loaded ammunition late in 1987, thus moving both the 22 and 6mm PPC into the current American rifle class. Actually, both should be considered European cartridges since they are both manufactured there, but they are American developments and most people look them here. The 6mm PPC is one of the top competitive benchrest cartridges. In addition to loaded ammunition and factory cases, make their own cases by fireforming 220 Russian cases necking-down and reforming 7.62x39mm brass.\r\nChronograph tests by various individuals have demonstrated that the 6mm PPC gives very uniform velocity readings, which may account for its very fine accuracy. On the other hand, practically all rifles chambered for the cartridge are special benchrest accuracy jobs, and that must also be a factor. Rifles for match shooting usually have a 1 in 14-inch twist. The 6mm PPC is not only an outstanding cartridge, but gives a very good accounting on small game and varmints. It is only slightly less powerful than the 243 Winchester, despite the much smaller case, and might also do well on deer or antelope at moderate ranges. The velocity with the 90-grain bullet is only some 100 to 150 fps less than the 243 Winchester.', ''),

However, it is by no means a toy. It is claimed that the bullet will penetrate up to 1.5 inches of pine, and that is sufficient to inflict a serious wound at close range.

Thought the chokes i got were faulty but it was the bore which was defected.\n\nAfzal, i can share all the material i have with me of 2010 model if u want.\n\nP.S  @12Guage, the gun is still with a gunsmith, the bore has been changed to .725 and after polishing, its .729 now, i have asked to give me a mirror polish on throat. I''ll be going on probably this weekend to test it. Trulock chokes will be delivered in about 2 weeks i believe.', ''),

You had kindly said to look into this matter. I wanted to know if they''ve resolved this problem.\n\n2) I''ve throughout read info about Hafiz Abrar Sahab (Rainbow), and Ashraf Sahb (Paragon). I must have missed it as my mistake, but just wanted to ask who is Mr Asrar (reference to your post # 552)? Is he related to Rainbow, or Paragon?\n\n3) Can members who have already purchased this gun give me information about reliability of this airgun? In other words, what is it''s life with average 10 palettes / day? \n\nI hope you or other senior members can find time to answer my queries (also questions of post#552).\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n[Edit: Sir, I just contacted Hafiz Abrar Sb today, he says courier charges are now Rs.300, total price with special stock being Rs 4300/-. I told him that charges with courier were Rs 4K, but he said those were from two months back, now prices have moved up. Is it still worth the purchase? I don''t want to pay him more than what other members here have paid. He also said if I wanted to book my order, I should let him know in 2-3 days, because he''s going to start production soon so have to book in advance before he starts his work. Also he quoted delivery to be in 15 days. Don''t know what to do. Bit confused. Can Dr Sb / someone please give me good guidance? I''d really really appreciate it...]', ''),

(344752, ' [B]240 Weatherby Magnum[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 240 Weatherby was added to round out  the Weatherby proprietry magnum line in 1968. It differs from the other 6mm’s in having a belted case along with somewhat greater powder capacity. It is very similar to the 240 Belted Rimless Nitro-Express introduced by Holland & Holland sometime around 1923. Thus far, it is available only in the Weatherby Mark V bolt-action rifle or through custom gunsmiths. It is an Excellent cartridge and will push the 100-grain 6mm bullet with about 200 fps greater muzzle velocity than the 6mm Remington and around 400 fps faster than the 243 Winchester. Obviously, it would be a somewhat more effective deer and antelope cartridge than the other two. The principal detraction regarding the 240 Weatherby Magnum is that ammunition and brass cases are expensive and difficult to find outside of the large cities. The 240 case has about the same capacity as the 30-06 and the rim diameter is also the same.\r\nThe 240 Weatherby is the most powerful of the 6mm cartridges generally available. It represents about the maximum performance the one can squeeze through 6mm tube with modern powders. The 244 H&H Belted rimless Magnum, based on necking-down the 375 H&H Magnum case, will hold more powder, but dosen’t produce much improvement in ballistics. The Late Roy Weatherby built a successful prorietry gun business on the basis of a good product plus the all-important element of ballistic one-upmanship. The Weatherby magnum cartridges have traditionally offered higher velocity and enrgy than their standard factory counterpart, and the 240 was born of this same tradition. Of course, Remington, Winchester, Norma all had their own magnum line in various calibers, and Winchester offered the 300 and 375 H&H Magnums long before WWII. However, Roy Weatherby was the first to really popularize this British innovation in the U.S. and convince the American shooter that it was something he truly needed. For the hunter who must have that extra edge in a 6mm rifle, the 240 Weatherby is undoubtedly the cartridge of choice.', ''),
(344649, ' [B]22 Accelerator[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 22 Accelerator is not a new cartridge at all, but rather a special loading of 30-30, 308 and 30-06 cartridges using a sub-caliber .224-inch diameter bullet held in a discarding 30-caliber plastic sabot. These loadings were introduced by Remington, the 30-06 in 1977, the 30-30 about a year or so later and the 308 in subsequent years. All versions employ a 55-grain soft-point bullet retained in a 7-grain, six-fingered, plastic sabot with a hollow base. According to the 1979 Remington catalog, the rifling of the barrel imparts a super high rate of spin, which, combined with air resistance, causes the bullet and sabot to separate approximately 14 inches from the muzzle. The 30-30-224 Accelerator has a muzzle velocity of 3400 fps; the 308 version has a cataloged muzzle velocity of 3800 fps; and the 30-06-224 the impressive muzzle velocity of 4080 fps. The existence of three different 30-caliber Accelerator rounds seems to indicate commercial success. It will probably be sometime before Remington introduces Accelerator cartridges in other calibers. Which calibers these might be will depend on Remington''s private sales results. It is worth nothing that there are many 270 rifles out there and Remington loads four different 7mm rifle cartridges.\r\nThe experimental shooting these Accelerator cartridges indicated that the accuracy is not as good as when the same 55-grain bullet is fire in one of the high-velocity centerfire 22 rifles, such as the 222 Remington, 22-250, etc. Actually, the Accelerator cartridges appear to group about the same as the standard 30-caliber cartridge does in the same rifle, which is just what the factory says it will do. In other words, if your rifle ordinarily makes 3-inch five-shot-groups at 100 yards, it isn’t going to do any better with the Accelerator loading. However, from a practical point of view, this is not all bad, and the Accelerator loads will allow one to use a regular 30-30 or 30-06 big game rifle for varmint shooting. The lack of MOA accuracy might restrict the effective range to 200 yards or less, but this will vary greatly with individual rifles. The Accelerator concept is probably of greater usefulness to the shooter who does not reload than to the fellow who can cook up his own varmint loads with light 110-grain 30-caliber bullets. After firing, the plastic sabots are usually found anywhere from 40 to 100 feet in front of the mule. Remington has applied an old principle to modern shooting ammunition and come up with what is potentially a very useful innovation.', ''),

(344660, ' [B]6mm Bench Rest Remington[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 6mm BR Remington is one of about eight cartridges based on the 308x1.5-inch case necked either up or down. It is impossible to determine exactly who first came up with the 6mm version because a number of individuals claim the honor, dating back to 1962 and 1963, However, Mike Walker of Remington Arms deserves credit for standardizing the dimensions and configuration in 1978. This also allowed the cartridge to eventually be adopted as a standard commercial cartridge, and in late 1988, Remington announced that the 6mm BR would be produced as fully-loaded factory ammunition. Prior to that, it was a sort of factory wildcat and cases had to be formed from Remington BR brass, which is actually a modified 308 Winchester with a Small Rifle primer pocket, comparatively thin walls and annealed to facilitate reforming. The new load has a 100-grain bullet with a muzzle velocity of 2550 fps and 1444 fpe. The 6mm BR was intended primarily as a benchrest cartridge, but it would also make a good varmint number. It is currently available as one of the chamberings for the Remington XP-100 single shot pistol.\r\nThe 6mm BR is similar to the 6mm PPC, except that the case is of larger diameter and has about 10 percent greater volumetric capacity. The 6mm PPC is loaded somewhat hotter than the 6mm BR with some loading manuals listing the 90-grain bullet at around 3000 fps. There is no reason why the 6mm BR can''t do anything the 6mm PPC can do, and the availibility of factory ammunition should increase its popularity. This will also help overcome one of the problems with the 6mm PPC-- the matter of obtaining suitable brass over-the-counter basis and at a reasonable price. Remington is chambering their Model 40-XB for the 6mm BR.', ''),

Let it dry out for 30 mins or plus and then apply thin film of a good gun oil thru an oiled cloth and put few drops of oil in critical moving parts. Other thing is WD40 also is coming fake in market.

However, it actually originated in Austria about 1913-14 as the round for the Erika auto pistol and is sometimes reffered to as the 4.25 Erika.

In 1903, the Belgian-made Clement auto pistol was adopted to the round and this resulted in the change of name. The cartridge is listed in the 1904 and 1934 DWM catalog (No 484) and was loaded until about 1938. It was replaced by the more effective 25 ACP.\r\nThe Clement auto pistol was well made and fairly popular in Europe. The 5mm cartridge is of bottle-necked type and the 36-grain bullet starts out at 1030 fps. Because of the velocity, it develops slightly greater energy than the 25 ACP. However, it is not a more effective cartridge for any purpose. Like the 25 ACP, it is not an entirely satisfactory self-defence number and not humane for hunting anything but rats, mice, sparrows or similar pests.

It is of .20-to .21-inch diameter and was available with a 37-grain lead or 34-grain full-metal cased softpoint bullet. According to White and Munhall, muzzle velocity is just a little under 600 fps. Muzzle energy would be about 30 foot pounds or less than half of the 25 ACP. Obviously not a very potent round. The cartridge has little practical value except for indoor target practice.

(344932, 'Getting The Most Out Of Your Baikal O/U Shotgun - Part 1 [B]AoA Everybody[/B]\r\n\r\nDuring one of my routine (but always extremely enlightening) conversations with Starfish, we both came to a conclusion that a budget shotgun''s performance and pleasure can be enhanced by a respectable level by adding some (functional only) after-market parts/accessories. Immediately light bulbs started flashing in our heads and we had ourselves a little project to kill a little time (and a few million brain cells in the process) over it.\r\n\r\nAs with any project, the price factor comes into play and we had to decide on the budget for the after-market parts/accessories. Starfish proposed that any Customization/ Add-ons should not cost any more than 30% percent of the value of a budget shotgun.\r\n\r\nHaving been given this target, I set out to customize a Baikal MP-27EM-1C over and under shotgun also known as IZH-27EM-1C (Same thing, just different product identification code). \r\n\r\n[B]Any how, all settled, this is what I had:[/B]\r\n\r\nBaikal MP-27EM-1C O/U Shotgun (Price): 50K\r\nBudget for Customizations/Add-ons: 15K (30% of 50K, Dah!)\r\n\r\n[B]This is what I wanted:[/B] (to improve the performance/pleasure of a budget shotgun)\r\n\r\n[B]Quality Recoil Pad:[/B] Limbsaver or Kickeez\r\n\r\nMy research led me to believe that both enjoy top of the line reputation and significantly reduce recoil. However one offering in Limbsaver''s precision fit line gave me the near perfect fit that I was looking for. Grinding and fitting a grind-to-fit recoil requires a lot of patience and I am the sort of a man who is always a little short on patience.\r\n\r\n[B]Better Sighting System:[/B] Fiberoptic or White Front Bead\r\n\r\nPersonal preference really but I like a good white bead (or a fiberoptic) at the business end of my shotgun. Some might argue that a bead doesn''t do much in improving a shotgun''s performance, well&#8230;, for me, Ya it does! Something that looks and feels that good can''t be wrong. Call me superstitious. Moving on!\r\n\r\n[B]Improved Patterns:[/B] Trulock Chokes or Carlsons After-market Chokes\r\n\r\nI measured the factory chokes supplied with the shotgun and boy! You''ll be surprised how way off the mark they were so had to do something about that.\r\n\r\nThere are quiet a few names in after-market chokes tubes but I''ve found that Trulock not only offers the most variety for Baikal shotguns but were also very welcoming in sending their precision engineered products to their International Customers in Pakistan. Therefore the choice was pretty clear. One thing I would like to mention here is that I''ve talked to almost every manufacturer of after-market chokes in the United States and nobody (I''ll repeat, nobody) even comes close to the quality of customer service that Trulock provides. Period!\r\n\r\nAs to which chokes tubes I needed, after reading up and consulting a few friends, I figured Skeet, Improved Cylinder, Modified and Full should pretty much cover most of everything I do with a shotgun.\r\n\r\n[B]Now the Pictures:[/B]\r\n\r\nI sincerely apologize for the poor quality of the pictures. Some are just not blessed with good camera skills. On top of that, creativity has never been one of my virtues.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00611.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAll Add-ons added to the shotgun. The patch you seen on the comb of the shotgun is actually an improvised cheek pad. Why I needed one, we''ll come to that later.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00612.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSame shotgun, different view. I''m basically trying out my luck with photography here.\r\n \r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00614.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nWe can clearly see that the limbsaver recoil pad is pretty close to a perfect fit (at least 95%). Let me say that it way better than any factory/OEM recoil pad I have come across so far. It houses dual chambers that compress when a shot is fired, significantly lowering the [B]thump[/B] of the recoil (technical jargon: recoil pulse).\r\n\r\nI could have gone for a Kickeez recoil pad which is also a big name in recoil reduction however Sorbothane (the stuff Kickeez recoil pads are made out of) weighs a lot and in my humble opinion, it feels like that it will catch on clothes a lot during mount. However Kickeez definitely looks better finished than a Limbsaver. \r\n\r\nFrom engineering standpoint, Kickeez is a pad made of Sorbothane (noise/shock dampening material) whereas Limbsaver is an engineered product which utilizes compression chambers to spread the recoil pulse. Take your pick based on whatever tickles your fancy.\r\n\r\nNow let''s talk a little about the white patch. This particular shotgun had too much drop at comb for me to begin with and as a result I was hitting below the Point of Aim. In order to fix that I needed to raise my rear sight (essentially the operator''s eye). While discussing some quality materials with Denovo87 bhai I came to know that the material he is using to make footballs is near perfect for my use. It''s strong, does not absorb water and doesn''t get stained. So, it was taped onto the comb using ordinary double tape available at auto part shops. Strong enough to last and leaves no residue once removal is required.\r\n \r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00619.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nHere we can clearly see the white bead at the business end of this shotgun. I will not go into the details of advantages/disadvantages of this thing but I wanted one.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00615.jpg[/IMG]\r\n \r\nThe same white bead is highly visible even under dim lighting.\r\n \r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00621.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis is what the bead looks like up close. In order to install it, the factory brass bead had to be unscrewed then this white bead of matching threads and diameter of the shank (This is where research comes into play) was screwed on. One can clearly see that the construction of the bead is quiet robust.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00625.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis picture shows Trulock chokes installed in both barrels. One can see that four slots machined into them for a firm grip using a four-slotted wrench. You can use conventional (factory supplied) wrench with them too or you can order one of their proprietary (e.g. speed wrench) wrenches.\r\n \r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00630.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nWe can see that these (flush fitting) chokes are supplied in stainless steel (mirror) finish and are laser marked with respective constriction and choke designation. I must say the finish is the smoothest I have seen so far on any machined object. The first thing that I noticed while screwing them in place was that how easily one can tighten them due to high quality threads machined into each choke tube. I practically screwed and tightened them using nothing more than finger pressure.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Baikal%20MP-27EM-1C%20Mods/DSC00632.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B]Specs and Cost:[/B]\r\n\r\nPrices are rounded off to the next number and all subsequent charges (such as shipping & handling and custom duties) have been added for ease in calculation however they do represent accurately the total cost born in acquiring and installing them.\r\n\r\n[B]Limbsaver Precision Fit Recoil Pad[/B]\r\nModel/Item No: 10601\r\nPrice: PKR 4,000\r\n[URL="www.limbsaver.com"]www.limbsaver.com[/URL]\r\n\r\n[B]White Front Bead:[/B] \r\nMarble Arms\r\nPrice: PKR 900\r\nThread size: m3.0x.5 or 3x.5mm or (metric) 3mm\r\n[URL="www.marblearms.com"]www.marblearms.com[/URL]\r\n\r\n[B]Trulock Choke Tubes:[/B] \r\nModel/Item No: Pattern Plus (flush fitting)\r\nPrice: PKR 2,500 each (10K for 4 chokes)\r\n[URL="www.trulockchokes.com"]www.trulockchokes.com[/URL]\r\n\r\n[B]Total Expense:[/B] PKR 14,900 (Pretty close)\r\n\r\n\r\n[B]Conclusion:[/B]\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project was not to prove that a budget shotgun can be converted into a high end shotgun by simply adding after-market accessories. All I am trying to suggest is that certain performance enhancement is possible if you wish to get the most out of your budget shotgun.\r\n\r\nIn short: One cannot convert a Toyota into a Mercedes however one can increase the pleasure of driving a Toyota by adding some quality wheels and a decent sound system.\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]\r\n\r\n[URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?6510-Getting-The-Most-Out-Of-Your-Baikal-O-U-Shotgun-Part-2"]Getting The Most Out Of Your Baikal O/U Shotgun - Part 2[/URL]\r\n\r\n[URL="http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.php?8286-Getting-The-Most-Out-Of-Your-Baikal-O-U-Shotgun-Part-3&p=248053&viewfull=1"]Getting The Most Out Of Your Baikal O/U Shotgun - Part 3[/URL]', ''),

(345080, ' [B]243 Winchester[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 243 Winchester was introduced by Winchester in 1955 for their Model 70 bolt-action and Model 88 lever-action rifles. The 243 was quickly adopted by Savage for their Model99 lever- and Model 110 bolt-action rifles. All or the British and European manufacturers began chambering bolt-action rifles for this round, including BSA, FN, Sako, Husqvarna, Mannlicher-Schoenauer and others. In fact, even Remington, who developed their own 6mm, had to recognize the popularity of the 243 and start chambering their rifles for it. The 243 (6mm) Winchester is nothing more than the 308 Winchester case necked-down. Original development and publicity was due largely to the efforts of gun writer, the late Warren Page, who along with other wildcatters worked out a similar version before Winchester. The 243 is probably chambered in more different rifles than any other cartridge, except possibly the 308 Winchester.\r\nThe 243 Winchester represents a successful effort to develop a varmint-to-deer class rifle that could hold its own with the various high-velocity 22s for extremely long-range use on small targets and still be adequate for the larger animals. The 243 does this job so well that it has taken a lot of play away from the 222 Remington and all the rest of the 22 cartridges. It eliminates the need to own two different rifles for anything from small game and pests right up to and including deer, antelope or black bear. The 80-grain bullet is intended primarily for varmint and medium-sized game and the 100-grain bullet for deer -size animals. The 257 Roberts and the 250-3000 Savage are supposed to cover the same range and certainly do. However, the 25-caliber bullets don''t have quite the sectional density for long-range varmint shooting until bullet weights gets up around 120-grains, and then the velocity falls off badly. All in all, the 6mm does a better job in covering the intended range of game and shooting conditions.', ''),

(345092, 'Review: Taurus 917 Salams, \n\nThe reason why I''m doing a review of the Taurus 917 is that quite a few members have reported a negative feedback regarding this gun''s accuracy. The good news is where as a few comments have been made about it being a bad shooter no has has claimed that it is unreliable or has FTF/FTE issues. \n\nI came across this gun a few years back, shot a 1000 odd rounds though it and moved on. I remember thinking it was a decent handgun and a good shooter. Infact I bought one for my brother as a home defense gun. The gun has a 19 shot mag capacity with a SA/DA trigger and a 4 inch barrel. The sights are fixed and a cocked and locked style safety and decocker are also present. The gun weighs around 900 grams, is well machined and the finish is good. \n\nThe trigger is a little hard and takes 5/6 shots getting used to. The back sights although fixed can be manually adjusted with a hammer if required. \n\nThere is nothing new or unusual about the gun, it''s a 92/99 with a one inch shorter barrel. I took some quick pictures posted below to do the rest of the talking.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1784[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1791[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1790[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1785[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1786[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1787[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1788[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1789[/ATTACH]\n \nTargets were shot at 15M. The gun shoots perfect there is nothing wrong with it''s accuracy. I would prefer it and rate it above the Cz999 and the Stoeger Cougar. \n\nI would also like to say to friends that please don''t form opnions based on other people''s experiences which might not be true at all. New shooters tend to blame the handgun rather than admit they are average shooters. Believing that one of the largest gun makers in the world is producing an inaccurate gun and that too of a copy of one the most famous designs in the world is just strange. \n\nThat reminds me of someone who returned two brand new pieces of an orginal Italian made Berretta 92 FS because he thought the guns barrels were bent because he was shooting to the right :doh:', ''),

(345124, 'What is the Distance to Target? - You Have No Scope &amp; No Measuring Device Some time you have to estimate the distance to the target. You have nothing at hand but just the rifle itself. How would you estimate distance?\n \nHere is how I estimate distance to target with the rifle front sight.\n \nMy rifle''s front sight is 1/16 inch (0.0625 inch) wide. The distance from my eye to the front sight (sight radius) is 30 inches. The ratio of these two measurements is: 30/0.0625 = 480.\n \nI aim the rifle and point the front sight on the target - a pigeon (Where I am, it is illegal to hunt any bird with a rifle - only shotguns are allowed for bird hunting. I am mentioning the pigeon just as example target). I notice the front sight covers the pigeon''s head. I estimate the head of the pigeon to be about one inch.\n \nWith the derived ratios of 480 and the pigeon''s head of 1 inch, the distance to target is: 480/1 = 480 inches or 480/12 = 40 feet. If the pigeon''s head looked 1/2 the size of the front sight width, the estimated distance would be: 480 X 2 = 960 inches or 960/12 = 80 feet.\n \nYou come across a rabbit in the field. You align the rifle front sight on the rabbit''s head. You estimate the rabbit''s head to be about 3 inches. The front sight covers the rabbit''s head about 1/4. You calculate the distance: (480/3) X 4 = 640 inches or 640/12 = approximate 53 feet. \n \nSince the rabbit''s head was 3 times bigger than the pigeon example, the 480 ratio was divided by 3. And, since the front sight covered rabbit''s head only 1/4, the number was multiplied by 4. If the rabbit was closer, the head would appear bigger as compared to the front sight. As the rabbit moved farther aways, the head appears smaller as compared to the width of the front sight.\n \nIn like manner, the width of the front end of the rifle barrel can be used as a measuring tool. My rifle barrel width at the front end is 3/4 inch (0.75 inch). With my rifle sight radius of 30 inches, my ratio now becomes 30/0.75 = 40. Now I have another tool for measuring distance.\n \nSince you sighted your rifle for one distance, it is essential for you to know the ammo trajectory and to know the distance to target. By applying this method of distance estimation - if needed, you can make aiming compensation before pulling the trigger.', ''),

(345130, 'Various Kinds of Ammo - Still Not Happy with Rifle Accuracy You have a rifle. You tired various kinds of ammo but still are not happy with accuracy. Beside the accuracy issue, you like the look and feel of the rifle. You want to keep - but, want to improve accuracy. You may have an option. \n \nIt is possible the rifling at the front of the barrel (the crown) is worn due to wear or damage resulting from improper barrel cleaning. It is also possible that the factory did not finish the crown properly. See my earlier post on how to examine the crown.\n \nI had a Ruger .308 rifle that did not give me satisfactory results - even with precision hand-loaded ammo. The previous owner had damaged the crown with improper rifle barrel cleaning method. \n \nI cut off 1/2 inches of the barrel with a hack saw. Then I used a metal file to smooth the end of the barrel. I made sure the "new" end of the barrel finish was at 90 degree angle to the axis of the rifle bore. This point is very critical as the gases behind the bullet must leave the barrel evenly.\n \nI used a grinding compound (used for car engine valve grinding and finishing) on the head of a brass bolt and started twisting it slowly against the crown. When I noticed that my progress was slow, I used electric drill and attached brass bolt to it. I placed some more compound on the bolt head and started slowly spinning it against the end of the barrel. Every now and then I wiped the end clean and used a magnifying glass to check the finish. When it looked shiny, smooth and rifling edges sharp, I stopped. I throughly cleaned the barrel with warm water. This project improved the accuracy of the rifle.\n \nAny time I wanted to clean the barrel, I used a small plastic tubing at the muzzle end before inserting the cleaning rod into rifle barrel. The plastic tubing prevents any future damage to the "new" crown. \n \nNot brave enough to cut the end of the barrel and finish is properly?

(345228, ' Salam All,\nWelcome to Pak Guns - I do hope you find all the knowledge you seek here on this site.  You will find many members from karachi there to help you.\nYou know the situation in Karachi is quite bad, although born there, Karachi is a changed place since I left which was at the age of 9.  Anyways, rather than give you advice on purchase of firearms, my suggestion would be - relocate to another city.\nIts like this time I was at a allergy specialist buying all kinds of allergy medicine for hayfever, animal dander and such... and the doctor looked at me and said why don''t you simply avoid these allergic situations and stay away from medicines, its after all its medicines (bad for you in the long run) not vitamins!\nFirstly, you will have go out and get training WITH various small weapons - only then will you be able to decide what suits your needs best.  Once you have that figured out then you will have to apply for and get the license and then locate the weapon of your choice.  Assume for arguments sake you have done all this, you will then need to practice shooting regularly which is either an added expense of joining a club or travelling by car to the outskirts of Karachi, and being a school teacher, the cost of ammo purchases will cut into your income.  Worst of all, having never been around firearms, this is a home disaster waiting to happen.  Most firearm accidents happen at home... for your info.\n \nSomething to think about.\n\n@Common.Denominator - Very well stated, I believe that small preventative measures will help you stay safe by way of deterrents.\n\nMy opinion - don''t take an extreme position on this matter till you have tried alternative measures first.', ''),

(345262, 'You Admit Your Mistake?  - Wish You Did Not Sell Your Rifle/Handgun? You ever look back and wish you kept the rifle or the handgun you sold?\n \nI admit to having made this kind of mistake several time - but, at least two times in particular. \n \nIn the very early 1960''s I bought a 22LR S&W K22 revolver from a retired policeman who lived near me. It was esentially in new condition. Over the years I used the handgun for target practice. Few years back, someone who knew me talked to me about the K22 that I kept wrapped in a towel. He told me to "bring the towel". He examined the K22 closely - he was collector of guns. He asked if I ever fired the gun. I said I did fire it many times - but kept it clean and stored it properly.\n \nHe asked me how much it would take to buy the K22 from me. No one ever made me an offer like this. I named the price and he put the money bills in my hands. Afterwards he said to me that in the many years of gun collecting he had not come across a K22 that in like-new condition. \n \nSecond case I recall was a Wichester 22LR 69A. It was equipped with a rear peep sight with 1/4 minute adjustments (each 1/4 mniute represents 1/4" inch at 100 yards). It was from the prior 1950 era. When I got it/bought it, the bolt action was very rough. I took the bolt out of the receiver and took the bolt apart. I quickly found out that someone had improperly assembled the bolt. I put the parts in their proper places and the bolt started working properly.\n \nThe walnut stock of the rilfe was in good shape but the finish of the wood was not to my liking. I sanded the varnish-like finish to the bare walnut wood. I used a wet cloth to wipe the wood to raise the wood grains. I sanded the stock with finer and finer wood sanding paper. Lastly, I used fine steel wool on the wood stock. When the work look smooth, I applied linseed oil into the wood and buffed it until wood grains appeared applealing to me. Finishing of the wood stock took many, many hours.\n \nI used my refurbished 69A for years. The 69A did not bear a serial number. Then, someone came along and asked me if I wanted to sell it. I said how much would you pay? He asked how much I wanted. I named the price and he handed me the money. \n \nDuring the late 1950''s and early 1960''s I had acquired a large collection of Mossberg 22LRs from an old-timer. Over time, the Mossbergs slipped from hands into the hands of others.\n \nIn hindsight I wish I had the K22 and the 69A back in my hands.', ''),

However, as you mentioned the price of both in US - if we were in the US and we are not - bear in mind that all a Glock owner has to do is spend 120usd on a longer ported barrel, another 200usd on disconnector/trigger/spring combo, FULL adjustable Meprolite three dot night sights 150usd - total being: 470usd (parts)+499usd(gun)= 969usd.

In the Ruger category there is pretty much only one rival out there and thats the Buckmark.\r\n@Skeeter 60 - Sir, having fired the Ruger first, I believe you will never look at a Buckmark; however, I urge you to try out the Buckmark with the bull barrel, I believe it will amaze you.', ''),

(345508, ' [B]224 Remington[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 224 Remington was introduced by Remington in 1955, chambered in their Model 722 bolt-action and later available in the Model 760 slide-action, and for a short time in the Model 742 autoloader. The cartridge is based on the 257 Roberts case necked-down to 6mm and was actually originated as a wildcat by Fred Huntington of Oroville, California. The wildcat version preceded the factory design by several years and was called the 243 Rockchucker. Only Remington chambered the 244 among American manufacturers, but several European-made bolt-action rifles were available in this caliber.\r\nThe 244 Remington is ballistically almost identical to the 243 Winchester. The only notable difference is that Remington made their 6mm rifles with a 12-inch twist  (one turn in 12 inches), whereas Winchester adopted a 10-inch twist for their 6mm. The net result is that the 244 Remington will not handle spitzer bullets over about 90-grains in weight while the 243 Winchester very well with 100-or even 105-grain bullets. Remington looked on the 6mm as largely a varmint and small game development and concluded that anything beyond the 90-grain bullet was unnecessary. Winchester, on the other hand, decided the 6mm was very much a big game cartridge and therefore the heavier bullets would be highly desireable. Who was right ? It happens if something like 8 to 10, 243 Winchester-chambered rifles were sold for one 244 Remington. Remington changed to a 9-inch twist at the last, but too late to rescue the 224 from oblivion. What Remington did to extricate themselves from this delimma was to change the name of the 244 to the 6mm Remington and make all such rifles with a 1 in 9-inch twist. for additional information see the 6mm Remington.', ''),

(345520, ' [B]6mm Remington[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 6mm Remington has exactly the same case configuration as the 244 Remington and differs only in the fact that it is loaded with bullets of up to 100-grains, whereas the 244 Remington was never loaded with bullets of over 90-grains weight. Ammunition marked 244 Remington can be fired in 6mm Remington chambers and vice versa. However, rifles marked 244 Remington will not stabilize the 100-grain bullet. The difference in the two is that 244 rifles (if manufactured by Remington) have a 1 in 12-inch rifling twist and rifles marked 6mm Remington have a 1 in 9-inch twist. When Remington introduced the 244 in 1955 the selected the 1 in 12-inch twist as best suited to long-range accuracy with bullets of around 80 grains. They were quite correct except that most shooters wanted to be able to to use 100 to 105 grains in order to cover the range of game from varmints through deer with the same rifle. To correct this misjudgement of the shooting public, Remington renamed the cartridge and changed to a 1 in 9-inch twist. to have retained the 244 designation and simply change the twist would have brought complaints from purchasers of the original244s with the slower twist then they tried to use the new 100-grain load. The change in cartridge nomenclature to 6mm and the faster twist occurred in 1963. The Rmington 700 series and 788 bolt-action rifles as well as their autoloaders and the slide actions have been available in 6mm. \r\nThe original 6mm Remington was loaded only with the 100-grain bullet. However, later it was available with 80-, 90-, and 100-grain bullets which greatly extends its flexibility. Although the older 244 lost out to the 243 Winchester, the 6mm Remington is gradually picking up an enthusiastic following. It is an excellent choice for the varmint hunter who also wants to use his rifle for deer and antelope. Although the 6mm has a slightly larger powder capacity than the 243, the difference in performance is negligible as far as killing power is concerned. Nevertheless, this small advance in ballistics appeals to some people and so does the longer neck of the 6mm case, which many handloaders consider desirable.', ''),

The ruger 10/22 is semi-auto and its own type of rotary magazine which some times give troubles with different brands of ammo, but Brno will digest easily what ever brand  you feed her.\nRegards.', ''),

(345578, ' [B]22 Remington Jet[/B]\r\n\r\nThe 22 Remington Jet, also known as the 22 Center Fire Magnum, was introduced jointly by Remington  and Smith & Wesson. The first developed the cartridge, the latter the revolver. The first news of this cartridge "leaked" out in 1959, but production revolvers and ammunition were not available over the counter until into 1961. The S&W Model 53 revolver is the only revolver ever to chamber this cartridge, and it was discontinued in 1971. The 22 CFM grew out of popular wildcat handgun cartridges such as the Harvey 22 Kay-Chuk and other based on the altered 22 Hornet case, plus special hand-altered revolvers. Marlin once offered a rifle for the 22 jet (the Model 62 lever action) and the H&R Topper also offered it for a time. The Thompson/Center Contender is the only handgun currently chambered for the 22 Jet.\r\nRemington and Smith & Wesson teamed up to develop a new concept in handguns and cartridges. The 22 CMF is strictly a hunting and sporting number intended to provide high velocity and flat trajectory in the field. The M53 will also fire the regular 22 rimfire by use of supplemental steel cartridge chamber inserts and an adjustable firing pin-a handy arrangement. This cartridge has ample performance for any small to medium game at ranges out to 100 yards and beyond, but not many people can shoot a handgun that well.\r\nwhen first announced, most gun writers and gun editors went absolutely wild praising the fantastic performance. The velocity of 2460 fps was supposed to be developed in an 8.5-inch barrel. Chronographed tests by various individuals, indicated an actual velocity around 2000 fps in this length barrel. Quite a come down, but it is still a good cartridge. The S&W Model 53 in 22 Jet was discontinued due to problems with the cylinder locking up when firing full powered loads.', ''),

(345623, ' When posting this thread I knew it would get some ''Glockaholics'' ruffled up ;)\n\nI would like to say that this was a shooting session on a range where thankfully there was no mud, rain, enemy soldiers or life threatening situations involved. This is also the case with 99.9 % of my friends here at PakGuns, we use our guns on paper targets and little else. \n\nI would also like to clarify a few points that Glock enthusiasts like to highlight and compare them with the CZ Shadow and CZ''s in general.\n\n1). Glocks are NOT more reliable than CZ''s. Infact both are equally reliable and trusted as much for carry as the other. I have never known a CZ to FTF/FTE in over 10,000+ rounds nor have Glocks. On another note I have never had a misfire with a CZ clone as well  (Canik 55) in the 6500 + rounds I have fired from it. Infact I keep it as my night stand gun even though I own and have owned atleast half a dozen Glocks.  \n\n2). The CZ''s are much more accurate out of the box than Glocks. There is no confusion on that point. \n\n3). CZ''s are easier to shoot as the Glock triggers don''t suit everyone the same. Some love it and some hate it.\n\n4). Cz''s are beautiful while Glocks are.. to put it diplomatically ''bland''.\n\n5). Cz''s are just as durable as Glocks and last forever. \n\n6). Glocks are lighter but the slighter heavier weight gives the CZ''s a better recoil and easier more accurate follow up shots. \n\n7). Glocks while sold as DA/SA are not. My understanding of a double action trigger is each time I pull the trigger on an empty gun it resets to fire again. Glocks have a SA and ''sort of D/A'' trigger. \n\n8). Cz''s triggers are easier to practice dry firing on. With the Glock you find yourself racking the slide after each fire, with CZ''s you can simply pull the Trigger again or recock the hammer.\n\n9). There are as many after market parts for the CZ''s available as for the Glocks.\n\n10). The Glock is simpler to disassemble / assemble but the CZ is not difficult either. Cz''s on average take 2/3 seconds more. \n\n\n@Skeeter, Denovo, HassanJamshad, Anthrax, Moeen, Dr. Zakir, Scorpio Thanks.\n\n@Abu Hawal +1\n\n@Denovo Lolz not big hands I presume. I wouldn''t have sold my Glock otherwise but a friend asked a favor, he needed one cheap and the market price these days it 330 K so I let it go. Looking to buy a 4th gen later on. \n\n@Khurramdool Brother you misunderstand. Glock is not a good gun, it is a [B]fantastic[/B] gun and probably one of the best guns ever made. I am simply saying that it is not worth 300 K + (USD 3500) specially when other better guns are available for half it''s price. In car metaphors, would you buy a Corolla if you could get a Camry and Accord [B]both[/B] for price of a Corolla ?\n\n@Aquarius Not saying sell Glocks, saying buy more CZ''s ;)\n\n@Moeen ;) Your assessment on the Glock shooting as well or better than the Shadow after installing aftermarket parts may be correct but in Pakistan installing all those parts would push the Glock price to the 450 - 500 K region. Meaning 1 Glock shooting on the same (or better) level than a Shadow = 4 Shadows ? This is X5 / X6 territory which is sort of insulting to be compared to a Glock. \n\nOn another note even most friends who own Glocks still prefer to carry either Taurus or CZ because I quote "Glock are too expensive to carry". ;)', ''),

Sir jee, that is exactly what I''m saying, since genuine POF may cycle perfectly, we''re throwing the guns to cheap, local made DARRA type ammo, which I feel should not be the perimeter to gauge CZ''s sensitivity! And course we''re discussing both things, sensitivity to different type of ammo, in order to categorize the CZ or the Glock.\n\nWell, let me put it in another way. The dubious POF ammo was tested by myself and Gilani Sb in different guns and heck the Maestro was lucky not to drop a CZ-999 due to the unexpected high recoil from these. I still remember how Gilani Sb stopped shooting for a while and checking the CZ-999, which literally seemed to have pained his hands!\n\nNow, this means that this DESI POF ammo has even a higher kick then the genuine POF, which Gilani Sb is quite used to firing with. Hence, if the genuine POF 2Z ammo is slightly +p, the dubious one is for sure full +p! Now, in order to judge the CZ''s ammo sensitivity as such, we should perhaps check them with real +p rated ammo, where I still feel they''ll be performing satisfactorily, leaving only the [B]recycled[/B] feature/quality of the dubious POF as the [I]culprit[/I], why the CZ''s are not digesting it, due to deformations perhaps in the casings.\n\nHence, I still feel, this sort of ammo should not be the benchmark for categorization.\n\nThat the Viking and OSS responded well too, well, how do we say it, just call it a fortunate thing for Viking/OSS owners, and one more reason why you should pretty soon have one of these back to your closet, lolz!\n\nRegards.', ''),

(345740, 'Which Bullet has More Energy - Increase Weight 25% or Increase Velocity by 25% In this hobby of ours, we play with numbers a lot. \n\nWith guns, lot of subjective elements come into play - look, feel, etc. On the other hand ammunition is another breed that we select not by look and feel but with the desired results. If the target is paper, we want to hit the mark. If the target is an animal, we want to bring it down. This discussion is about the energy of a bullet, kinetic energy - energy due to motion of the bullet. \n\nThe formula for bullet energy is:\n\n[(bullet weight in grains X bullet velocity X bullet velocity)] / 450,435. \n\nChange in bullet energy is proportional to change in bullet weight. Increasing bullet weight by 25% will increase bullet energy by 25%. \n\nIn the examples below let us see how change in bullet velocity effects the bullet energy.\n\nExample 1: any caliber, bullet weight 40 grains, bullet velocity 1,000 feet per second.\n\n[(40 X 1,000 X 1,000) /450,435 = 88.8 foot-pounds\n\nExample 2: any caliber, bullet weight 40 grains, bullet velocity 1,250 feet per second.\n\n[(40 X 1,250 X 1,250)] /450,435 = 138.7 foot-pounds\n\nExample 3: any caliber, bullet weight 40 grains, bullet velocity 1,500 feet per second.\n\n[(40 X 1,5000 X 1,500) /450,435 = 199.8 foot-pounds\n\nExample 4: any caliber, bullet weight 40 grains, bullet velocity 2,000 feet per second.\n\n[(40 X 2,000 X 2,000)] /450,435 = 355.2 foot-pounds\n\nTaking example 1 as baseline we see that increasing velocity by 25% (from 1,000fps to 1,250 fps) results in bullet energy increase of 49.9 foot-pounds (138.7-88.8) or an increase of 56% from baseline. \n\nIncreasing the velocity by 50% (from 1,000 fps to 1,500fps) from baselines results in bullet energy increase of 111.8 foot-pounds (199.8-88.8) or an increase  of 125% from baseline.\n\nFinally, increasing the velocity by 100% (from 1,000fps to 2,000fps) from baseline results in bullet energy increase of 266.4 foot-pounds (355.2-88.8) or quadrupling (4X) of bullet energy. \n\nIf given the choice - increase bullet weight by 25% or bullet velocity by 25% to gain bullet energy - the choice is clear - go for increase in velocity. Adding 25 % to bullet weight gains 25% bullet energy. But adding 25% to the bullet velocity gains 56% bullet energy.', ''),

Glock has way more loose chamber than CZ.\nAlso check slide to frame play, glock has minimal while CZ has tighter tolerances there.\nAs per ammo sensitivity issue, tighter chamber can result in higher sensitivity to Magazine feed.\nVariance in ammo quality can show up some difference here too, such as reload and resized cases. \nCZ may over come this by applying less support to the cartridge and bigger/less steeper feed ramps but this is true in case of Glock again, and not CZ.\n \nPrimer ignition incase of tough primers is dependant on solid firing pin strike and I dont think it should be considered in ammo sensitivity department, it is rather general reliability department (ofcourse ammo sensitivity falls under it as well), can be cured with replaced springs, (not a design weakness) IMO, just like recoil springs are changed to match grain of ammo/powder types.\nFor a normal person to judge they both are equally reliable. \n \nBut as far as designs are concerned, Glock is an outstanding combat handgun design while the CZ Shadow is Excellent one.

(345860, 'You are Ready for the Big Hunt - Is Your Weapon Ready? Are You Sure? We get an idea in our head that we need to hunt - perhaps ancient survival instinct, hunt or die of hunger. Perhaps this instinct is in our genes. I think we in this hobby are born with this behavior. \n \nOnce the hunt idea gets in our heads, we start preparations. We start taking mental notes what will be needed and start collecting the "stuff" for the next hunt - the big hunt. We all wait. We start the mental clock running that counts backward - like launching a space capsule, 10, 9, 7....\n \nSo it was with me in the mid 1950s. I lived on a farm. I had an old Winchester pump 22LR. There were plenty of rabits around for my killer instinct. I was getting bored with small game. I want to go for the big one. I made up my mind that this was my objective.\n \nI lacked an appropriate weapon for the big hunt I had in mind. I made up my mind that I wanted a shotgun. With a shotgun, I reasoned to myslef, I could hunt birds and big game. The law allowed me to use the shotgun for big game if I used slug cartridges.\n \nI found and bought a used 12 gague shotgun. To this day I can not recall the brand I bought, but it was 12-gauge for sure. I remember the bore as the only slug ammo I could find was 12 gauge rifled slug. \n \nThe shotgun has a simple bead for sighting. For me to hit the big one I had make sure the simple bead at the end of the shotgun would be able to do the job. I started to practice - 75 yard target with slug ammo I bought. Soon I was able hit the spot where my previous shot went. I was ready, my weapon was ready - I thought it was.\n \nThe hunt was to be in the mountains - about 3 hours of driving time. When my mental countsdown went to 1, I headed to the forest. I arrived at the campsite in the late afternoon. I left the campsite on foot to do some scounting. Tell tale signs told me that the big game I was after was there. I made a mental note of the spot that looked ideal for me to hunt the next day - 30 minutes before sunrise.\n \nI went back to the campsite and tried to get sleep on the back seat of the car (cars in those days were big, really big). I could not sleep - I had "hunt fever". I was up most of the night. Most of the time I spent in the car looking at my watch. The minute hand (no digital watches in those days) was moving slow, the hour hand seemed to be stuck. Time moving too slow for me. I finally decided to get out of the car, take my shotgun and ammo and head for the hunting spot I selected the evning before. \n \nI found my way to that spot. Again, I started looking at the dial face of my watch. I felt the watch was working against me, The big hand was moving a bit but the little hand hardly moved. At times I thought my watch was broken. Finally there was some light. The hour hand did move. Now it was up to the big hand to let me into the big hunt. \n \nFinally the time came - 30 minutes before sunrise. My eyes were open super wide. My head moved side to side, up and down. I spotted the big one. I took a deep breath, aimed and pulled the trigger. I did not hear a bang or a kick to my right shoulder. I pulled the trigger again. Again nothing - no bang and no kick. I ejected the cartridge in the chamber and loaded another. To my luck the big one was still there. I took another deep breath, aimed and pulled the trigger. Again, nothing happened. I said to myself - I did aim and I did pull the trigger. Then all of a sudden I had a chill - something is wrong with the shotgun. Again - talking to myself - I shot it the day before and it made a bang and it kicked my body. \n \nDejected, I came back home. I discovered that a small piece of metal had ruined my big hunt. It was a broken firing pin. Once in while my mind goes back half century to recall this event. Even to this day that recollection gets me a bit upset - not as much as 50 years ago, but still upset. The big one was a big deer.\n \nIf you are ready for your big hunt, is your weapon ready? Are your sure?', ''),

(345955, 'Ruger Standard 22LR Semi-Auto -  Custom Work &amp; Custom Look It was about early or mid 1960s, I saw a gun dealer  advertisement for a Ruger 22LR semi-auto - later called the Ruger Standard 22.\n\nIn the advertisement the picture of Ruger looked like the style of German Lugar. I not only liked the looks, I liked the price even better. I still have the cancelled check showing the price I paid,  under $30 for this brand new pistol.\n\nThe Ruger not only looked good, it functioned well. When the honeymoon with the Ruger was over, I took it apart and cleaned it. Upon closed inspection I discovered the finish of the gun was lacking in quality. Many of my older guns - guns much older than the Ruger carried a better metal finish under the blue finish.\n\nI considered rebluing it to a darker finish to hide the machine tool markings on the metal. Until now I had reblued only two 22LR rifles before with results that were so-so. Here I had a gun that was brand new and I was thinking of messing up the blue finish it carried. Perhaps I was out of my mind - even thinking about doing this.\n\nI kept saying to myself - they did sloppy metal finish. My mind was made up. I wanted to finish the metal beneath the blueing to perfection. I had emery cloth and steel wool. That was all that I need. Since the gun was already apart, I started working on the barrel first as this was the prominent part of the gun that attracted the eye. I built up courage and wrapped a strip of emery cloth around the barrel. With one hand I firmly gripping the emery cloth and with the other hand I twisted the barrel.  After few twists, I unwrapped the emery and took a look. I must have twisted the emery cloth very hard as I got down to the bare metal pretty fast. I saw and could feel with my finger nail the machine cutting marks around the barrel. Again, I said to myself - they did a sloppy job. I was not happy. Now I was stuck - I had done the damage to the pistol. Now there was no going back.\n\n\nMany-many hours, days and weeks passed. I was making progress. Finally I started seeing the daylight in my project. All metal surfaces that I could see now had a mirror smooth finish -very smooth but dull finish.\n\nHaving brought the metal to perfection (perfection in my eyes), I had to make a decision on how to apply a finish to the bare metal surface. My brother made a suggestion - why not plate it? I said, how would I plate it? He said that he had a friend who does plating. I said ok. In turn he asked me what kind of plating I wanted. I asked him what were my choices, he said nickel or gold. I asked him to have it nickel plated. \n\nWhen the gun came back from the plating facility, I could hardly recognize the piece. It looked so pretty. I gave the "new" Ruger to my brother as a gift. The gun was never fired again. It became a museum piece - for show.', ''),

(345980, '22LR Ammo Decision Time - Hollow Point or Round Nose Solid? We have our favorite 22LR rifle ready and waiting. We want to hunt small game. Of all the ammo available, selection is now  narrowed to hollow point or round round nose bullet. Which one to pick?\r\n\r\nIn hunting the objective is impart all the kinetic energy (energy due to the moving bullet) into the animal. If the bullet exits the animal on the other side, some of the bullet energy is lost. For a given animal, solid bullet is more likely to go farther into the animal than hollow point bullet. Hollow point bullet on impact will the same animal is likely to have shallower wound - but a bigger wound. \r\n\r\nThe design of the hollow point is such that the bullet nose, upon impact with the animal will expand - much like a larger caliber bullet hitting the animal. This bullet expansion assures that maximum amount of bullet energy goes into the animal. The negative of the hollow point bullet is the tendency (at times) to disintegrate upon impact and not generate a large deep wound in the animal.  This is specially true if the bullet hits a bone of the animal. In this case the bullet may shatter or take a different travel path.  \r\n\r\nHollow point and round nose solid bullets have their negatives and positives.

(345987, 'Ruger Target Rifle Changed Into Hunting Rifle I have always admired the quality of target rifles. In a lineup, the target rifle can be spotted quickly.\n\nOpportunity came and I bought a new, in the box, Ruger M77 VT in stainless steel with two-stage trigger at a very attractive price. Th rifle was in the condition as advertised - brand new.\n\nI took the rifle apart to see the trigger assembly and bolt mechanism. I was impressed by the quality of workmanship. The rifle had 26 inch very heavy barrel and a very sturdy laminated stock. I hand loaded some ammo and tried it. I likes the results.\n\nMy neighbor who lived across the street had a shot gun that he used for bird hunting. He learned that I was planning a deer hunt. He had not hunted big game before but he wanted to join me in the hunt. \n\nHe lacked a rifle for big game. He said he wanted to buy one like the one I bought, Ruger M77 VT. I told him that I got it at a very special price and that another one was not available at that price. He asked for my opinion as to which one to buy. I recommended the standard Ruger sporter. He bought the rifle that I suggested.\n\nOur hunting site was over 800 miles from home. We took turns driving the long distance. Finally we arrived at destination and set up camp. We did some scouting the day before deer hunt started for the area we were in. We were there for five days. \n\nI had bought a shoulder sling for the new rifle. I carried the heavy monster target rifle on my shoulder up and down the mountains - like a mule.  I noticed that in that in thick forest it was difficult to swing the long barrel. The deer that we saw were not worth shooting. \n\nOn the last day of the hunt, my friend fired some shots with his new rifle at a distance spot. I gave him my rifle to him to try. He asked me how come his rifle gave him bigger kick than my rifle - we use the same ammo, my hand loaded ammo. I told him that reason for kick difference was due the weight difference in the two rifles. We came back home empty-handed.\n\nI learned two lessons from this trip. One, my gun was too heavy for me to use it in the field. Second, the 26-inch barrel was too long to swing it in the forest.\n  \nAfter I came back from this hunting trip, I started with the two lessons, reduce the weight of the gun and the length of the barrel. Since the rifle was a target model, the stock was very sturdy - made of laminated wood and some kind of resins in it. The stock where the barrel rests was very fat and flat at the bottom. I decided to trim the width to make it look like a sporter version. The stock part where the cheek rests was thick. I decided to trim what was thick and fat. \n\nWith a laminated stock, the only way I knew to trim was to use a band sander. I did not have one but another neighbor did. I used his sander and trimmed the stock to my liking. The wood parts that got trimmed looked different than the rest of the wood as I had taken off the factory finish. Now I had to sand the whole rifle stock to make the finish look even and smooth. Sanding that stock was hard work - the wood was very tough. I sand  finished it to my satisfaction. I applied linseed oil for the finish. \n\nI cut barrel was to a length of 22 inches. My earlier post explains how I cut another rifle barrel and how I finished the crown. After all the work on the wood and metal was done, I assembled the rifle. It looked and worked like a precision instrument. It was a target rifle that was ready for the field. Cutting the barrel from 26-inch 22-inch reduced my velocity a bit - nothing to complain about. I was happy with the results of my effort.', ''),

(345990, 'Peep this Sight We are very much familiar with the open rear sight of a rifle. Those who know the peep sight, when given the choice, will most likely dump the open rear sight and pick the peep sight instead. Why such a preference?\n\nOpen rear sight requires alignment of three points - rear sight, front sight and the target. With peep sight, only two alignment point are required - front sight and the target. When looking through a peep sight the eye automatically self-centers the rear sight in the peep hole. All that is required is to align the other two points - front sight to the target.\n\nOn most rifles (not all) the rear sight is installed father back - closer to the shooter. This positioning of the peep sight farther aways from front sight gains the advantage of a larger "sight radius" (see my earlier post). Larger sight radius gives advantage in the precision of alignment. Peep sights have more positions  of alignment for elevation and wind than the regular sights. With a peep sights, adjustment of 1/4 inch (or even more refine) at 100 yards are possible. In contract, the regular open rear sights are not as precisely adjustable.\n\nIn metal sights, the peep sight has the advantage - take it.', ''),

(346057, ' As-salaam alaikum fellow PG hobbyist.\n\nI was inspired by your discussion and field report on this weapon and had decided to buy one. I think that you''re more experienced than us here in the Philippines judging upon the date, comments, and reports made in various thread here. Also, from a visit to our pinoy1911.net from by [B]Bro[/B] [B]K B W[/B]. ([URL]http://www.pinoy1911.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6798&start=10[/URL])\n\nPeople here in the Philippines generally do not favor Chinese made weapons since they regards Chinese products as inferior.(though I generally disagree since I own a couple of them and had friends who had personally tested them in the field) It is only just recently that Norinco had quite a following due to its price and robustness. My unit cost me 11,500.00 pesos or roughly 19,575.75 Rupee plus licensing cost of around 4,000.00 Pesos with a license processing of 4 days.\n\nMy unit was black matte finish. It has the Norinco logo, NP42 and 9x19mm markings, Laser etched and almost unreadable. It came with 2 magazines, a box, & a cleaning rod. No Manual.(I survived cleaning the gun by watching [B]Bro Antharax[/B] Youtube video, Thank you and your English was great!)\n\nMy NP42 package came with 2 different magazines:\n1. One resembles a lip of an NATO 5.56mm rifle magazine  \n2. The other looks like your regular 9mm magazine.\n\nI''m coordinating with our local gun store here to see if the other units they''re selling had non-identical looking magazines like mine. Funny thing I noticed was that my guns serial number(1000, for example) is also laser etched on both my magazines and are serialized as 1000-1(magazine 1) and 1000-2(Magazine 2).\n\nI haven''t tried firing the gun at the range yet to see it both works but  I had problem hand cycling the slide with the regular 9mm-look  magazine. Have anyone experience ending up with 2 different looking  magazines? If someone had, did both mags cycled well during firing? \n\nI hope you can help me guys with my question. I would appreciate any feedback. Shukriya :-) \n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]1852[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1853[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1854[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]1855[/ATTACH][IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y246/Fabrique/NP42/100_0733.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y246/Fabrique/NP42/100_0753.jpg[/IMG]\n[I]\n[U]Pinoy Pistol Forum:[/U]\n[URL]http://www.pinoy1911.net/forum/index.php?sid=5c87d624a7496d4e8eaec92726bde7d2[/URL][/I]', ''),

Do you any any particular rifle in mind? If such is the case - make, model, caliber and approximate age of the weapon would be of help in searching for any options that may be available to you. Many older 22LR rifles had two or three threaded holes on the left side of the receiver - toward the rear. In those rifles, replacement is very easy.

Having decided that hollow point bullet is not the type suitable for the game you are after (see earlier post), now your decision rests with 40-grain solid bullets that are either round or flat nose. Which brand to select? This decision may depend on what is available in the local market.\r\n\r\nWinchester, Remington and CCI are popular brands and are available in many place. This discussion is about comparing 40-grain, non-hollow point ammo of these three manufacturers and to see if there are any direct substitutes within these brands.\r\n\r\nWinchester: \r\n(XT22LR) Super-X Standard Velocity  1150/976, 117/85\r\n(WD22LRB) Dyan Point 1150/976, 117/85\r\n(X22LR) Lead Round Nose 1255/1017, 140/92\r\n(X22LRSS1) Lead Round Nose 1300/1038, 150/96\r\n\r\nRemington:\r\n(21022/21284) Target, 1150/976, 117/98\r\n(1500+/1522) Golden Bullet, 1255/1017, 140/92\r\n(TB22A/TB22B+++) Thunderbolt 1255/1017, 140/92\r\n\r\nCCI:\r\n(0032) Standard Velocity, 1070/908, 102/73\r\n(0953) AR Tactical, 1200/964, 128/82\r\n(0058) Lead Flat Nose, 1235/992, 135/87\r\n\r\nHere is how to read the last entry under CCI: (0058) is the manufacturer''s designation for this ammo. AR Tactical is the common given name. 1235 is the velocity in feet per second at the muzzle. 992 is the velocity in feet per second at 100 yards. 135 is the bullet energy in foot-pounds at the muzzle. 87 is the bullet energy in foot-pounds at 100 yards.  \r\n\r\nNotice that Winchester (X22LR) Lead Round Nose, Remington (1500+/1522) Golden Bullet and Remington (TB22A/TB22B+++) Thunderbolt have the same performance specifications listed above.

(346111, 'Number One There can only be one - Number One. No arguing, 22LR (22 Long Rifle) is the caliber of choice in the whole wide world. The 22LR can be fired in rifles and handguns. It is available in remote corners of the world.\n\nThe reason for the popularity are many and not difficult to enumerate. The 22LR is the cheapest brass cartridge available. Due to the low cost, most beginners start with a rifle in the caliber. Beginners also go for this one because the recoil is minimal. Upon pulling the trigger there is no worry of receiving a big kick in the shoulder. Also, there is no big bang on firing the weapon.\n\nMany hunter use 22LR for small game and varmint control. Many carry firearms of this caliber for protection or survival situations. Shooting 22LR has taken an art form - target matches that command precision of the shooter, precision of the rifle and precision of the 22LR ammunition. To cater to  the diversity  of shooters, manufacturers have developed a wide variety of ammunition to meet those needs. Within the small range of bullet weights that can be loaded, there is an array available ranging from below subsonic to supersonic velocity.\n\nJust because the 22LR cartridge is small, it does not mean that it is a play-thing. This cartridge is lethal. Not that it is designed for this purpose, with proper placement, it can kill big game like a lion (22LR is illegal for hunting lions). In this shooting hobby of ours, we need to pay due respect and practice safety in handling all ammunition and all firearms.\n\nThe tiny 22LR is the world choice caliber. My vote also goes to the 22LR. This cartridge has a very long history, spanning well over a century. Long live the 22LR. 22LR - Zindabad!', ''),

(346115, ' [QUOTE=Moeen;184011]Salam All,\nWelcome to Pak Guns - I do hope you find all the knowledge you seek here on this site.  You will find many members from karachi there to help you.\nYou know the situation in Karachi is quite bad, although born there, Karachi is a changed place since I left which was at the age of 9.  Anyways, rather than give you advice on purchase of firearms, my suggestion would be - relocate to another city.\nIts like this time I was at a allergy specialist buying all kinds of allergy medicine for hayfever, animal dander and such... and the doctor looked at me and said why don''t you simply avoid these allergic situations and stay away from medicines, its after all its medicines (bad for you in the long run) not vitamins!\nFirstly, you will have go out and get training WITH various small weapons - only then will you be able to decide what suits your needs best.  Once you have that figured out then you will have to apply for and get the license and then locate the weapon of your choice.  Assume for arguments sake you have done all this, you will then need to practice shooting regularly which is either an added expense of joining a club or travelling by car to the outskirts of Karachi, and being a school teacher, the cost of ammo purchases will cut into your income.  Worst of all, having never been around firearms, this is a home disaster waiting to happen.  Most firearm accidents happen at home... for your info.\n \nSomething to think about.\n\n@Common.Denominator - Very well stated, I believe that small preventative measures will help you stay safe by way of deterrents.\n\nMy opinion - don''t take an extreme position on this matter till you have tried alternative measures first.[/QUOTE]\nYes like I said, I am fully aware of the responsibilities of keeping a weapon at home.

That''s the technical +point only, yet it requires that one has tested one''s semi-auto [B]extensively[/B], with different forms of ammo and selected one that is totally reliable and that the gun digests with no issues at all. I personally would use only the top notch of imported shells in a semi-auto security shotgun, that too, after testing out at least 4-6 boxes.\r\n\r\nThe pump action literally takes any kind of ammo, as long as you stay away from expanding, cheap reloads.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(346315, 'You Hunt - You Give When we hunt for game, we take aways something from nature. A good conservationist always gives something back to nature.\n\nI recall going hunting with two friends in the late 1960s. It was the fall season. We had our hunting licenses and deer tags (permits for taking deer). We had plans for a 7-day hunt. For transportation we used a large pickup that I had. We gathered all the supplies we could think of for our needs; food, water, clothing, etc. \n\nThe trip was to a national forest - well over three hours of driving time. We studied the forest map and decided that we would initially camp at a mountain top - elevation 8,847 feet (2,697 meters) for the first few days. From Los Angeles we had to go north and cross the Tejon Pass in the Tehachapi Mountains. Once over the mountain range, we refuled the pickup and headed west on a lonely country road that would lead us to forest. As we were nearing the forest, the paved road became narrower and narrower. Finally we saw the entrance sign of the forest. We registered our names at the ranger station - in case of an emergency situation.\n\nOur initial destination was to the top, the very top of the mountain to set up camp. We were going in the forest on dirt roads - more like trails. They were winding up and around the curves. At each trail junction we consulted our map so we take the right route and not get lost. The drive in the forest was exhausting. Finally, we were at the top, a small plateau with a ring in the center. The ring was a  circle of rocks being used as a fire pit. The forest service had placed a portable latrine at the far end of the plateau.\n\nOn the afternoon of our arrival we rearranged our supples and "things". Our plan was to sleep in the back of the pickup truck. For the evening we had to transfer our supplies into pickup cab to make room for our sleeping bags. In the morning we would reverse the process, roll up our sleeping bags, transfer the supplies from the pickup cab to the back of the pickup.  \n\nOn our first late afternoon we did scouting - looking for tell tale signs of deer, any deer. We went down perhaps 1,000 feet and came back up before dark. Official dear opening season was to begin the following day, 30 minutes before sunrise. We were all excited, waiting for tomorrow to come.\n\nWe were up early the next day, ready with our backpacks, our rifles and maps. The official deer opening time ticked to the zero hour, zero minutes. Few moments later, in the far distance we heard sounds of gunfire - some lucky hunter spotted a deer and got one or shot at one and missed. We were looking for similar opportunity, hoping it would come our way. Noon time came and we sat down to have our packed lunch. We shared with each other our observations. About 15 minutes later we were again on our feet, looking for what we came for - deer. At the end of the day we headed back to camp. On the second and the third day, our results and findings were no different. We did see deer - female deer, not legal to hunt. It turns out our planning did not take into account the very low temperatures we were to encounter at the mountain top. Our sleeping bags were not warm enough to keep up comfortable. In the mornings we woke up shivering from cold.\n\nAt the end of the third day we decided to move to a lower elevation and locate a site where we could set up camp within the rules of the forest service.  By nightfall, we were at a different location. Since we had arrived late in the evening, there was not enough daylight left to do some scouting. We had to do this the next day - we were going to be left behind. We figured that other hunters in the area would have done their scouting and positioned themselves at the right "hot spots". All the same, we got up very early to make up for lost time. The new day and the next day our results were the same - we saw deer, but only female deer. \n\nWe decided to call it quits. Our next day was to be day number six. We had planned for seven days. We were going to go home one day early. With nothing else to do on the sixth day, we decided to brainstorm - what to do on the sixth day. We had noticed that on our way to the forest on the lonely country road, we saw empty bottles and cans along the road. At about the same time, we came to the same conclusion - we were going spend the whole day picking up  cans and bottles along the country road until the day was done or the pickup was full. \n\nWe would take tunes driving the pickup - one behind the steering wheel, the remainder walking on each side of the road. It was a back breaking effort - spotting a bottle or can, bending to picking it up and throwing it in the back of the pickup. It was an honest day of work. The day was over, the pickup full and we were all tired.\n\nI came back not with a deer as I had planned, but with a pickup full of empty cans and bottles. When my neighbor saw my pickup full of cans and bottle, he jokingly asked if I was going into the trash business. I had a situation at my hand - how I was going to dispose of what was behind the pickup? It took several weeks to empty the pickup truck by filling up the city provided trash bins. The municipality collected the household trash on a weekly basis. Every week I would fill up my trash bin and that of my neighbor (he gave me permission) with cans and bottles.\n\nThe hunt we went for was uneventful. But, we were more than satisfied in cleaning up litter along a lonely country road. Years and decades later, we look back and feel happy that we had done a good thing. We went to hunt, in turn we gave something back.', ''),

(346328, ' I am sorry, I no longer have the Ruger M77 VT. I exchanged it for another firearm. Unless the money pocket is deep, the only way to experience other firearms is to let one go and replace it with one you do not have. Over the decades that I have been in this hobby, I have done this exercise numerous times - too many to recall all.\n\nWhen I shortened the barrel the first time, I thought that I was a nut - not qualified to do it properly. After I had cut the barrel the first time, the cut (made with a hack saw) looked crude, like some blind man had done it. It took a metal file and some time to make crown flat - 90 degree to the axis of the bore. The finishing part was easy. The M77 VT was a target rifle and not intended for use in the field for hunting. I cut the barrel so the gun could be used in hunting. Most sporting rifles have  barrel lengths where there is no need to shorten them. You may come across a rifle that upon close inspection of the crown ( with glass magnifier) see need for some "help". In most cases this can be resolved by simply re-crowning (see my earlier post). Please bear in mind that if you have a metal front sight, you are limited to the amount barrel length that you can cut and still retain the original metal front sight. Usually there is only a small length ahead of the front sight that could the target of  the cut. The Ruger M77 VT did not have a front metal sight.', ''),

(346417, ' .22--the hunter''s choice\nThe .22 caliber pellet grew out of the .22 rimfire, which, at the start of the 20th century was the choice for most small shooting jobs such as pest elimination. But, a .22 caliber pellet is no longer the same diameter as a .22 rimfire bullet, nor will a rimfire barrel work well for pellets. The rimfire barrel is sized 0.222" to 0.223" across the grooves, while the airgun barrel is sized 0.217" to 0.218".\n\nTwenty-two caliber was the most popular airgun caliber in America until the late 1960s. That''s why more airguns of that caliber exist among the vintage and antique guns made in this country. The .22 caliber pellet is definitely the choice of the hunter and pest eliminator. It hits harder and also transmits more of its energy to the target than the smaller .177. A .177 pellet traveling at high-velocity is small enough to pass completely through the body of a small animal, leaving no visible signs of trauma if a vital organ or bone is not hit. Even a chipmunk can be "acupunctured" in this way. Of course, the animal is in extreme pain, but since animals don''t act the same as humans, it appears to simply run off. Usually, it will die several days to weeks later, after suffering increasingly greater pain.\n\nThe same thing CAN happen with a .22 pellet, but, because of the larger size, it''s much less likely. Speaking of high velocity and hunting with pellet guns, let''s clear up a misconception. In firearms, a high velocity bullet does so much damage to its target that much smaller calibers can be used to hunt big game. This began with the introduction of the .220 Swift in 1935 and grew very popular through the promotion of Roy Weatherby.\n\nBut, pellets are not centerfire bullets. They don''t travel 3,000 f.p.s. and faster. Even at a top speed of 1,200 f.p.s., a pellet is going WAY too slow to have a similar hydraulic shock effect on game. So a "fast" pellet is of no advantage to a hunter unless it also carries a large amount of energy that it can successfully transfer to the animal. That''s why the .22 is the king of the hunting calibers.\n\nAs far as general shooting goes, the .22 caliber is just fine. The pellets do cost more than .177s and the velocities of the guns are usually slower, but a good shot will have no problem with a .22. It''s the second most popular airgun caliber.', ''),

They will also show deformation of their head and it was real nasty for them. Is that also a problem in Ireland?[/QUOTE]\r\n The disease you are referring to is called Myxomatosis,and is a horribile one which causes an horific death,we get it here at times,but it is not that common.', ''),

It is in a very good condition and perhaps has its case too. Colt has the best trigger in revolvers and they are very durable and not at all ammo senstive. It is really an collecter item. They do get sold but resale is quite slower then semi autos. Accuracy is great, they are basicly comptition guns and with 8 inch, it would be more accurate, best for wild bore and other hunting games. but i think price is high. Why not get the number from sales man and call the owner may be he can give you the good bargain.', ''),
(346506, 'Ten Degree Edge I have a friend who is into blades of all kinds, including pocket knives. He was introduced to me about quarter century ago. His passion is custom knives - he makes his own knife blades and knife handles. \n\nOn each visit (I have not seen him for a couple of years) I used to see one or two knives on his desk that were in various stages of "production". He made those knives for himself.\n\nMy recollection is that at age about 8 (now I am almost 71) I was in the Shahi Bazar in Bahawalpur looking at pocket knives. Since then I have had one or two knives at all times - usually kept at home, but at times one in my pocket when hunting. Knives were not my passion; but, I had interest in them.\n\nWhenever a knife became dull, I pulled out my sharpening stone and started to work on it. I usually tested the knife edge by the "paper"-cut method - apply the blade to the edge of the paper. If the blade at any point hesitates against paper, the blade is considered not sharp.\n\nWhen I started to show some interest the knives that my friend made, he asked me if I had any pocket knives. I told him that I had two at home. He told me to bring them at the next visit, which I did. Few weeks later on the next visit I saw two pocket knives sitting on his desk. I asked him if I could see them - he said sure, go ahead. I picked them with one hand. When I opened my hand, I realized the knives in my hand were my own. My friend made them look like new and sharpened the blades to perfection. He gave me research papers on the topic of sharpening blades. \n\nAbout three years ago, I came across someone who was a collector of knives. I traded with him a non-functioning air rifle for a dozen of his old pocket knives. Even though I have had a knife or two all my life, my interest was only casual. Now that I had a dozen, I started researching about my collection. It turned out that only one knife was worth keeping and restoring. The tang of the knife is stamped "Schrade+ USA 227UH". The handle of the knife bears "Uncke Henry" emblem. It has a stainless clip and skinner blades. The length when close is 5 1/4 inches. The handles are Derlin stag with silver bolsters and brass linings. According to my research, the knife was made between 1972 and 1983. The exact date of manufacture is not know.\n\nI worked many hours on this knife to put it in decent shape and sharpen it to my liking. I measured the thickness of my main blade - three mllimeters.  the width -18 millimeters. I had read articles about the appropriate angle of the blade. There was no definite finding what that angle should be. With the blade measurement I had taken, I applied trignometry to find the angle of the blade if I ground the blade perfectly flat - instead of creating a cutting angle just at the last 2-3 millimeter of the blade. This required lot of sweat bring the steel blade (400 series stainless steel) perfectly flat. My calculations concluded that the final angle would be 10 degrees (9.5604 degrees to be more precise).\n\nI used a two-sided  stone with one side medium grit and the other side fine grit. I used water on the stone as a lubricant. I soaked the stone overnight in water. As I worked the blade against the stone I kept an eye that the water surfaced on each stroke. If it did not, I soaked the stone again in water. After the rough spots were gone from the blade, it still required lot of labor to bring the knife edge to a wedge shape, like an axe blade. I sharpened the secondary blade, but not to the same angle as the thickness of the blade was not the same as the heavier duty blade.\n\nI will pass this knife to my elder grandson when he comes of age.', ''),

It is not defined (I have not come across it) in a dictionary. It is like the Aryan baradari (I am Aryan). I call the love and passion of 22LR the 22LR kinship or 22LR baradari.\n \nTake two individuals, from two different countries that are not friendly toward each other. These two individuals meet in a third country. Neither one knows where the other one is from. In talking, they come to learn that both have interest in 22LR firearms. What began as 22LR discussion, leads them to share personal family information. Their talk goes on until they run out of steam. Near the end, each learns the origin of the other - the country they are from. \n \nThe relationship - the 22LR kinship established earlier when the they first met, leads them to part ways as friends. This is akin to two boy scouts from different countries meeting each other as friends. \n \nPerhaps, now the meaning of 22LR kinship is coming into focus.', ''),

(346603, 'Transforming Rifle Stock - From Beat Up to Good Looking Over the years I come across rifles that looked beat up - wood stock in pretty bad shape, dings, scratches, etc. \n \nWhen we get a new rifle, we admire the looks, specially the stock - it shines from the final finish put on that wood. When we get the first scratch in the stock, it hurts the most. Scratches that come later do not feel as hurtful. Times passes, the rifle starts to look like it belongs to someone and not you. You start to alienate yourself from the not-so-good-looking rifle.\n \nI have gone through all those stages. I have also gone through the renewal of life of those same beat up wood stocks. I make an assessment - is the wood-look too ebarrassing to me? If I answer no, I keep using the rifle, as is. If the answer is yes, I remove the wood stock and I get to work. Necessary supplies for the project are simple to acquire: some cloth rags, wood sanding paper of different grits and lindseed oil (also called flax seed oil) for the finish.\n \nStarting with course paper, remove all slick/shiny finish. Gradually user finer and finer wood sanding paper to make surfaces smooth. At times you may need to cut the sanding paper in small strips and fold the strips and use like a shoe-shine boy uses his polishing cloth to polish shoes. You are not polishing the wood, only making the wood surface smooth. \n \nAs you get closer the desired wood surface finish, use wet-damp cloth to wipe all sanded surfaces. This wiping process will bring up the wood grains -like beard whisker. Use the finest wood sandpaper to remove the wood whiskers. Do this a couple of times. Throughly wipe the wood clean multiple times. Now you are ready to apply the linseed oil as your finish. Use a small piece of cloth and fold it several times so you get it into a square - about 3-4 inches. Pour few drops of linseed oil onto the cloth. Slowly start rubbing the cloth on a small aread of the sanded wood stock. Pour few more drops of the oil and do so the same on the adjoining areas, making sure to rub the overlaping surfaces.  After you have finished this process, leave the wood stock overnight. The next day, repeat the process and again leave the wood stock overnight. On the third day, use a damp (not wet) cloth and start polishing the wood. You are not going to see any shiny, slick finish. But, you will see beautiful wood in its natural grains and glory.\n \nIf you ever get a scratch, just rub it with some linseed oil, and it will again come back to its original condition. I do not have any refinished stock to show you at this time. Next time I tackle this kind of project, I will take photos.', '');

Trajectory knowledge is power in your hands - know your caliber.\r\n\r\nA bullet fired from a gun does not travel in straight line. Law of gravity pulls the bullet down from the moment it leaves the muzzle. To compensate for this behavior, the gun sights are above the barrel bore and adjusted accordingly for the distance intended target. Some calibers have flatter bullet path than others. All the same, the laws of gravity and physics pulls them down to earth.\r\n\r\nThe sportsman usually has distance in mind - be it a a paper target or living thing. Common practice is to sight the gun for that distance. But, what if the distance to target or game is not known. Perhaps an estimate of that distance can be made. If the sportsman knows the trajectory of the ammo he is using, he is in a better position to adjust his aim point accordingly. Lack of bullet trajectory knowledge can mean the difference between a successful hunt and coming home empty-handed.\r\n\r\nAmmunition manufactures make trajectory information readily available for the various kinds they do make.

(346663, '22LR - Kill How Far? No doubt we have heard, read or experienced bringing down a rabbit with an air rifle. If an air rifle can kill a rabbit, how far can a 22LR kill the same game? Let us see.\n \nIn this excercise we will use an air rifle that delivers velocity of 1,000 feet per second. For the ammunition we will deploy a good quality pallet that weighs 10 grains. With the given velocity and pellet weight, we can calculate (see earlier post for bullet energy calculations) the energy at the muzzle is: \n \n[(10 X 1,000 X1,000)] / 450,435 = 22.2 foot-pounds\n \nThe rabbit shot with the air rifle was at some distance from the shooter. Let us give benefit of a doubt in favor of the air rifle and assume the rabbit was in front of the muzzle - meaning distance was 0 yards and bullet energy was 22.2 foot-pounds.\n \nNow let us see the energy that a popular high velocity 22LR ammunition can deliver at long distance - say 800 yards. Most ballistics tables go to range of 100 or 150 yards. I used an online ballistics calculator and entered the required information.\n \nFor this example I used a Winchester (X22LR) 40-grain round nose lead bullet with muzzle velocity of 1,255 feet per second. Before I could enter what was required in the calculator, I had to use another calculator to estimate the bullet coefficient. Bullet coefficient (BC) is a numerical measure of the bullet shape in overcoming resistance to air in the flight path. For this bullet the estimated BC was 0.134.\n \nThe rifle was assumed to have sight that was 1.75 inches above the bore of the barrel. The rifle was sighted for 800 yards. The ballistics calculator revealed the following.\n \nBullet energy in foot-pounds:\n200 yards 71\n300 yards 57\n400 yards 47\n500 yards 39\n600 yards 33\n700 yards 27 \n800 yards 23\n \nWe can see from the above that a high velocity 22LR bullet will deliver the same amount of energy at 800 yards that an air rifle delivers at the front of the barrel - the muzzle.\n \nLet us now see the bullet drop data: \n100 yards +185. inches / 15.45 feet / 5.15 yards\n200 yards +170.2 inches / 14.18 feet / 4.73 yards\n300 yards +151.2 inches / 12.6 feet / 4.2 yards\n400 yards +129.9 inches / 10.74 feet / 3.58 yards\n500 yards +102.9 inches / 8.58 feet / 2.86 yards\n600 yards +73.3 inches / 6.1 feet / 2.03 yards\n700 yards +39.0 inches / 3.25 yards\n800 yards 0.0 inches\n900 yards -45.7 inches / -3.8 feet / -1.27 yards\n1,000 yards -97.3 inches / -8.11 feet / -2.7 yards\n \nIf an air rifle can kill a rabbit at a distance of 0 yards, the 22LR has same amount of bullet energy to kill the same rabbit at a distance of 800 yards. Now we get an idea of the lethality of the 22LR. It is diminutive in size but deadly in power. Distance of 800 yards is almost 3/4 kilometer (731.5 meters). \n \nWe need to pay due respect to the power of the 22LR and all other ammunition. Always - safety first.', ''),

(346702, 'Naked Look Take a naked look in the bore of your rifle. You may be surprised at what you see.\n\nFirst, before you do anything with the rifle, make dead certain that there is no ammunition in the chamber or in the magazine. Please, remember - safety first. \n\nIf the rifle is bolt action type, take the bolt out of the receiver. If the rifle is 22LR semi-auto, hold the bolt in the open position by the small lever near the trigger guard or near the bolt itself. If this lever is lacking, you may have to hold the bolt open by your fingers. In this case a helper would come in handy. To view the inside of the barrel of a  22LR semi-auto, a small mirror is needed.\n\nHold the muzzle toward not-too-bright sunlight. Examine closely the condition of the groves (deep channels) and lands (high ridges) from one end of rifle barrel to the other end. Repeat this examination by looking at the interior of the barrel from the other end. For 22LR semi-auto, use the mirror to get the light into the barrel. Examination of a semi-auto 22LR is not as thorough as with a bolt action rifle because direct straight-line view is not possible. \n\nIf you see fouling or copper build-up, it may be time to clean the barrel. Only do the bore cleaning if you have learned the proper technique, otherwise you are likely to damage the crown -front end of the of the barrel. Excellent rifles have been ruined by individuals with good intentions. Application of a steel rod against the inside of a steel barrel make a poor combination. If the rod gets damaged, you are likely to throw away that rod. What if the barrel of the rifle gets damaged? Are you ready to throw away that rifle?', ''),

Let us see.\n \nDo you have a rifle that gives "erratic" results on the target? No matter which ammunition your try, your shots land all over the place. Perhaps the cure for this ailment may be as near as your screwdriver.\n \nRifle components receive severe punishment as we pull the trigger. The burning powder in the cartridge propells the bullet through the barrel. As the bullet travels violently through the bore, vibrations and their harmonic waves reach bolts and screw - esentially every part of the rilfe. Over time, those bolts and screws may become lose. This in turn results in loss of rigidity and firmness that is so essentail in an accurate rifle. Every bolt, screw and nut needs to be attended. They need the proper amount of torque. This deficiency may have originated directly from the factory, due to faulty assembly.\n \nIf the rifle wears a optical scope, pay attention to the screws that hold the scope mounts on top the rifle receiver. Don''t forget the screws on the rngs that couple the optical tube to the scope mount.\n \nAfter you have made an inspection, attend to the points as needed. You may be surprised by the results.

I stretch my arm, make a fist and point the little finger toward the side (not up & down). I look at the little finger with my right eye and measure the distance between the eye and the little finger. It  measures  30 inches. \r\n\r\nThe ratio between the width of the little finger (0.5 inch) and the distance between my eye and the little finger (30 inches) becomes my measuring instrument. In my case it is: 30/0.5 = 60\r\n\r\nI stretch my arm and aim the width of little finger against a person standing away from me. He appears to be as tall as the width of my little finger. I judge he person to be about 6 feet tall. For every foot of the person''s height, the width of the little finger represents a distance of 60 feet. Since the person is judged to be 6 feet tall, the distance to him is about 60 X 6 = 360 feet (120 yards).\r\n\r\nLet us say I was wrong in judging the person''s height. Instead of being 6 feet tall, the person in fact was only 5.5 feet tall. In this case the estimated distance would be: 60 X5.5 = 330 feet (110 yards). \r\n\r\nThe error is 360-330 = 30 feet (10 yards).\r\n\r\nOur initial estimated distance of 360 is still within 10% of the actual distance. \r\n\r\n 30/330 = 9.1%\r\n\r\nIn like manner you can use your thumb, width of the closed wrist, length of finger, thumb, distance between joint of fingers and other body parts as measuring tools.

(346975, ' @philosgal\r\n\r\nPhysics 101: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. whenever you launch a projectile with forwards, equal amount of the that force (hence reaction) travels backwards. the heavier the projectile, the higher recoil. the lighter the projectile, the lesser the recoil.\r\n\r\nTherefore every firearm that launches a bullet will always have recoil. the trick is to pick up the weapon that you feel most comfortable in terms of recoil. there are some factors that lower recoil such as weight of the gun. the more the weight of the firearm the lesser the recoil. the closer the axis of the bore (gun''s) to the operator''s hand (or shoulder for a shoulder fired firearm) the lesser the (perceived/felt) recoil.\r\n\r\nanyways, in my humble opinion, one can easily get used to any recoil as long as the operator is familiar with that weapon. woman in my home happily shoots 9mm handgun which always scares me to death. lols! ;) not because I am uncomfortable with the recoil. i''m more uncomfortable with the idea that she can always use me for target practice if I ever manage to piss her off. hahahahahhaa.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(347037, ' I am willing to take a chance in exchanging my rifle with your rifle. Your rifle may or may not give me better results. I do have a large variety of 22LR. It is possible that from the variety of ammo I have at hand, I may find one type that may "favor" the rifle you have. Customarily you get the rifle and look for ammo that it "favors".  In this case I have already tried my rifle with the ammo I have. My underlying motive is to try your rifle with my ammo.\n\nWhen acquiring a rifle (new or used), I try out variety of my ammo before deciding the ammo that the rifle "favors" the most. I have come across shooters that have done this exercise with over sixty kinds of 22LR ammo wit hone rifle. I have only about twenty types of 22LR ammo. Poor results on target (shooter considered marksman) can not be blamed on the rifle alone. We are looking for a happy marriage between the rifle and the ammo. We can not go out buying a rifle every day. But, now and then, we can go out and buy 22LR ammo that we have not used with the rifle in question.\n\nWith 22LR ammo there is no way to change components of the cartridge. The only choice is to change between brands and types of what is on the market. This is not the case with center fire cartridges. I can hand load center fire ammo by selecting my propellant (powder), bullet, primer and empty brass cartridge. In hand loading center fire ammo I can take measurement of the empty brass cartridges to check for consistency and correct some elements as needed (thickness of the neck, cartridge length). I can do the same about primer seating depth, overall length of the loaded cartridge, etc. I can more precisely do the loading steps than any fast churning ammo factory can produce. I can charge the cartridge with powder to within 0.1 grain (0.65 milligram) by weight. Take apart a box of center fire commercially loaded cartridges and see the amount powder variation within that box of 20 - (or what quantity is in the box).\n\nThe idea is to vary the components (mostly bullet make, type, design, weight along with the propellant type (slow, medium or fast fast burning) and propellant amount. At times, it is found that by reducing the velocity (reducing the powder) a more perfect match ca be found between the rifle and the ammo with hand loaded ammo.\n\nIf the scenario involved center fire rifle, I would have no interest in trading/exchanging my rifle for yours. \n\nI like the 22LR. It is low in cost. I can do good amount shooting to practice the hobby and not burn a hole in my money pocket. It is an ideal cartridge for small game. I sing 22LR praises all the time. 22LR - Zindabad\n\nThank you all.', ''),

(347044, 'Review Diana Air King 54 [U][FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=5][/SIZE][/FONT][/U]\nBefore I write anything about this impressive springer, let me just say that Diana Air King, Model 54 is perhaps the King of Air Guns. It is an Air Gun lover&#8217;s dream come true, sheer beauty, very accurate and a collector&#8217;s item. The Diana Air King Model 54 comes in three calibers .177/4.5mm, .22&#8221;/5.5mm and .25&#8221;/6.35mm. The air gun being reviewed has a .22&#8221;/5.5mm caliber.\n\n[URL="http://postimage.org/image/285nvxnvo/"][IMG]http://s4.postimage.org/285nvxnvo/IMG_2084.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\n[FONT=Book Antiqua][COLOR=darkorange][U][SIZE=5]Vital Stats[/SIZE][/U][/COLOR][/FONT]\n\nModel    : Diana 54 AirKing\nManufacturer:     Mayer & Grammelspacher\nCountry of Origin: Germany\nType:     Spring/piston (semi recoilless)\nAction:     Sidelever\nStock:     Beech sporter\nCaliber:     .22&#8221;/5.5mm\nWeight:    9.8 lbs / 4.5 kg\nOverall Length:     43.5 inch / 1100mm\nBarrel Length:     17.3 inch / 440mm\nTrigger:     2 stage adjustable\nMuzzle Velocity:    230 m/s or 850-900 fps\n\n[B]OTHER FEATURES:[/B]\n\nAdjustable Front Sight (Plastic)\nAdjustable Metallic Rear Sight (Elevation and Windage)\nCheckered Wooden Stock\nRamp for Mounting Scope\nRight Hand\nCocking Guard\nRubber Butt Plate\n\n\n\nThe Air King is a sheer beauty. It is an adult&#8217;s rifle, weighing 10 lbs and carrying along on a hunt can tire a person. But all things good have their downside. The checkered finish on the pistol handle and front stock ensures a good grip. This should suit hunters well as the hold can become slippery due to sweating, especially in summers.  The metal finish is very good and one can imagine the effort that must have gone in to make a rifle of this standard.the metallurgy is as good as Diana''s reputation.\n\nThe high quality Rubber Butt Plate provides adequate comfort to the firer&#8217;s shoulder and also serves to protect the air gun when placed vertically. Just two screws, one near the trigger guard and the other at the far end of pistol handle (both at the bottom) hold the springer in place. Loosen them and the air gun comes apart. The wood is of good quality as is always the case with Diana.\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://www.gunmart.net/images/content/gun_reviews/42/14.JPG[/IMG]\n\nThe screws are placed on the lower side since it is snot a break barrel type air gun:\n\n\n\nJust two screws hold the rifle in place:\n\n\n\nThe Diana Air King 54, has side lever and it is a fixed barrel rifle. The lever requires some effort to load the spring, I am not sure how much in terms of force. A cocking guard prevents the lever from accidental closure when loading the pellet. A gentle press is all it takes to bring the side lever back to its position. The movement of slide lever and cocking guard spell precision. The feeling is great, no bumps, stops or jams. On closing the slide lever automatic safety is applied. As with Diana guns the safety can be easily released with one&#8217;s thumb just before firing the gun. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe lever when opened makes an angle roughly 120 degrees, anything less and it won''t work:\n\n[URL="http://postimage.org/image/28bwt0v1g/"][IMG]http://s4.postimage.org/28bwt0v1g/IMG_2105.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nthe cocking guard and the rear sight:\n\n[IMG]http://www.gunmart.net/images/content/gun_reviews/42/06.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.gunmart.net/images/content/gun_reviews/42/18.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[URL="http://postimage.org/image/28c8dsahw/"][IMG]http://s4.postimage.org/28c8dsahw/IMG_2093.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nBoth the front as well as rear sights are adjustable. A small screw is required to be loosened to adjust the front sight. The ramp can be fitted with a scope, it requires stoppers though or the scope slides and has to be zeroed again. \n\n[B]The Best Part.[/B] The best part of Diana Air King is the recoil-less action. There is minimal recoil in the gun. This is achieved by a recoil-less mechanism consisting of a floating mechanism where the metallic part of the rifle (tube included) moves back on a rail while the pellet leaves the barrel. This backward action results is no or minimal recoil while at the same time improves accuracy. (As we shall see later). Although the movement is no more than 1&#8221; but even this is enough to compensate for the recoil. So basically the movement prevents spring vibration while the pellet safely exits, thus ensuring greater accuracy. Firing the King is a very nice and unforgettable experience.  \n\nThe front sight is made of good quality plastic and is adjustable as well:\n\n[IMG]http://www.gunmart.net/images/content/gun_reviews/42/05.JPG[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.guns.com.pl/photos/diana54_013.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://www.guns.com.pl/photos/diana54_021.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[URL="http://postimage.org/image/28cib0dgk/"][IMG]http://s4.postimage.org/28cib0dgk/IMG_2100.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nThe safety along with slide rail. The metallic parts move till the pistol handle:\n\n\n\n[URL="http://postimage.org/image/28ctvrsx0/"][IMG]http://s4.postimage.org/28ctvrsx0/Safety_and_rails.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]PRECAUTIONS[/B]\n\nThe slide lever requires some force to pull back to full position, it will make an angle of 120 degrees when fully opened. That is the point where cocking guard becomes effective. If the lever is not pulled back to its required position, the cocking guard will not function, will appear to be jammed. This is a dangerous position because at this point the rifle is not cocked. If at this time the lever is accidentally released you might injure your fingers/hand. After spending a little time with the rifle I was able to make out the cause. When the gun is fired the whole mechanism moves back by 3/4 to 1". It does not go back to its original position. So when you try to cock the rifle, it requires more force since it has to move the metal parts also. The way to avoid is to hold the rifle with the barrel pointing downwards (after firing it) and let the gravity work. The gun parts will automatically slide back to original position. Now the next cocking effort will not require much effort and won''t even jam.\n\nI found nothing wrong with the Air King 54. If there could be a sling attached to it, this would make it easy to carry in stead of tiring the hunter. I have seen hooks on some Diana models and I am sure with some good modification, these can be attached to it as well.\n\n[B]ACCURACY[/B] \n\nAre you kidding me? Just see the results. my rifle was fitted with a Bushnell Scope (Chinese). I shot about 20 plus pellets and couldn''t figure what was wrong. It would shoot groups and then would at once go haywire. The Chinese scopes loose zeroing after every few shots. So I removed the scope and shot at 20 and 25 M with Iron sights. I won''t say anything about the results, just see the targets screen-shots. This rifle will not miss its mark. \n\nResults at 20 M\n\n[URL="http://postimage.org/image/ytaoig04/"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/ytaoig04/20_M.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nResults at 25 M\n\n[URL="http://postimage.org/image/ytsvf9fo/"][IMG]http://s1.postimage.org/ytsvf9fo/25_M.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]CONCLUDING REMARKS[/B]  \n\nLike I said before it is a collector&#8217;s item. Its major pros are solid body, no recoil, reliability and excellent workmanship.  I can find no drawback or downsides. The price in Pakistan is around Rs. 60,000 which is quite steep for and air gun, but then the King is a leading model and a purchase which no one will regret. It is an air gun which promises to give years of service to its owner.\n\nP.S. The target used was a standard 25 pistol target. I wasn''t sure which target to use with this Air Gun. I  intend trying out this monster on more distance/range but 25 M was the maximum I could afford with conventional sights .', ''),

(347046, '22LR - Long Range Shooting Some of us in 22LR hobby are interested hunting small game at long distances. Is hunting range at 100 yards or more possible? Yes - If you know the game you are hunting,  behavior of your ammunition and be able to judge distance.\n\nBefore were can go long-distance hunting in the field, we need to get acquainted with ballistics. Ballistics is a science that tell us how a bullet behaves in flight. Our interest is in "exterior ballistics"  a science that tells us how bullet behaves once it leaves the barrel. \n\nCommon discussion about ballistics is actually discussion about "exterior ballistics". The term "interior ballistics" refers to what happens from the time the firing pin ignites the cartridge primer to the point where the bullet is about to leave the barrel. \n\nWe all know that rifle sights are above the barrel.  This means that when we aim our rifle, the bullet will have to leave the barrel and travel some distance going up before it cross a  point where it is in line with what we see from the rifle sight - from behind the rifle. this means we have slightly slanted the rifle barrel in an upward direction - the barrel is not horizontal to the ground. If we did not slant the barrel and left it straight, the bullet will leave the barrel and start going down due to the law of gravity and never cross our line-of-sight. If you understand what I said so far, the rest of the discussion is smooth sailing.\n\nWith our rifle barrel slightly slanted upward, the bullet travels some distance until it reaches a point where it crosses our line-of-sight as seen from the front and rear sights. This crossing point is commonly know as the "first zero". At this point the bullet does not change direction and start going in a straight line, it keep going upwards in a arch fashion until the gravity of the earth starts bring it down. After coming down, the bullet crosses our line-of-sight again. This is know as the "second zero". When we sight a rifle, we are commonly discussing the second zero point.\n\nNow that we understand basic ballistics, we need to turn out attention to the specific 22LR cartridge we are interested in using in our long-range hunt. We need to study the ballistics of this particular ammo - how it will behave in the flight pass until it reaches the second zero. \n\nIn this discussion we will use high velocity Winchester (XPERT22) 36-grain lead hollow point cartridge with muzzle velocity of 1,280 feet per second and 1,038 feet per second at 100 yards. Bullet energy of this cartridge is 131 foot-pounds at the muzzle and 70 foot-pounds at 100 yards. We will assume that the rifle sight is 1.5 inches above the bore of the rifle. \n\nFor this ammo a ballistics calculator gives us the following data: (distances in yards / line-of-sight-drop in inches / velocity of bullet in feet per second / bullet energy in foot-pounds)\n\n0  /  -1.5 / 1,280 / 131\n10 / -0.1 / 1,255 / 120\n20 / 1.2 / 1,176 / 110\n30 / 2.1 / 1,132 / 102\n40 / 2.8 / 1,094 / 95\n50 / 3.2 / 1,060 / 90\n60 / 3.3 / 1,031 / 85\n70 / 3.0 / 1,005 / 81\n80 / 2.4 / 981 / 77\n90 / 1.5 / 959 / 73 \n100 / 0.0 / 939 / 70\n\nFrom the above data we see that when we sight the rifle for 100 yards, the bullet will travel 60 yards and be 3.3 inches above our line-of-sight. If the rifle is sighted for 100 yards and the game is at 60 yards, unless you compensate accordingly, you may miss your hunt game. \n\nIn long range hunting, it is essential to be a good judge of distance (see my earlier posts) and know the ballistics of the ammunition in use.The 22LR has the same amount of bullet energy at 800 yards as a good air rifle that can kill a rabbit at 0 yards. Yes, you can shoot game at long distance and be on target - you have to know the distance to target and the ballistics of your ammunition.', ''),

So, diseases can be effect on any human being.\n\nNot only Muslims are forbidden, All Ibrahimic religions including Christianity and Judaism forbid believers for consuming pork. It is written in the Q''uran(Islam), Bible(Christianity) and Tanakh(Jew)\n\nWHY MUSLIMS ARE NOT EATING WILD BOARS\n\nWhy Muslims do not eat Pig and are forbidden to eat Pig because of certain reason.\nThe first and the main reason &#8220;God said by his messenger Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W) &#8220;Pig is haram for Muslims&#8221;. So, that&#8217;s sufficient for us being muslims.\n\nHARAM\n\nFirst look at the meaning of "Haram&#8221;\n\nHaraam (Arabic: &#1581;&#1585;&#1575;&#1605;&#8206; ; often haram) is an Arabic term meaning "forbidden". In Islam it is used to refer to anything that is prohibited by the faith. The religious term haraam can be applied to:\n\nCertain behaviors, such as adultery or abuse and profane language.\n\nCertain objects and sacrilege.\n\nCertain foodstuffs or food ingredients, such as Pig or alcohol.\n\nAnd also to foods, objects and people that would normally be halaal but which were tarnished in some other way, for example meat slaughtered in a non-permitted way.\n\n\nBut for more satisfactions; now come to the question is why &#8220;Haram&#8221;?\n\nHistorically Pigs declared &#8216;Haram&#8221; in the period of Prophet Hazrat Musa (A.S), and finally again said by Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W) in Holly Quran according to the order of God.\n\nQURAN  SAYING\n\n"Say: ''I did not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, except the meat of an already dead animal, or running blood or the flesh of swine (Pig) - for these are unclean - or flesh of an animal which has become profane because of slaughtering in the names other than Allah. Even so, if anyone is forced in a helpless situation, intending neither disobedience nor transgression, you will find your Lord Forgiving, Merciful.''"\n(Quran, Surat al-An''am 6:145)\n\nDISEASES IN THE PIG&#8211;WILD BOAR.\n\nEating of pig can cause no less than seventy different types of diseases. A person can have various helminthes like roundworm, pinworm, hookworm, etc. \nOne of the most dangerous is Taenia Solium, which is in lay man&#8217;s terminology called tapeworm. It harbours in the intestine and is very long.\n\nAnother dangerous helminthes is Trichura Tichurasis.\nTrichinella is the genus of parasitic; The genus was first recognized in a larval form in 1835.\nTrichinella is known as the smallest human nematode parasite. At the same time it is also the biggest of all intracellular parasites.\n\nA common misconception about Pig is that if it is cooked well, these ova die.\nIn a research project undertaken in America, it was found that out of twenty-four people suffering from Trichura Tichurasis, twenty-two had cooked the Pig very well. \nThis indicates that the ova present in the Pig do not die under normal cooking temperature.\n\nACCORDING TO THE &#8220;JEW & CHRISTS&#8221; \n\n&#8220;Do not eat any detestable thing. These are the animals you may eat&#8230; The pig\nis also unclean; although it has a split hoof, it does not chew the cud, you\nare not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.&#8221; \n(Deuteronomy 14:3-8) \n(Leviticus 11-1-8)\n\n&#8220;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have\nnot come to abolish them but to fulfil them. I tell you the truth, until\nheaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of\na pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is\naccomplished.&#8221; \n(Matthew 5:17-18)\n\n\n&#8220;A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged\nJesus: &#8216;Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.&#8217; He gave them\npermission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs.&#8221; \n(Mark 5:11-13)\n\nWILD BOAR HUNTING.\n\nSpotlight-Stalking-Driven hunting these methods are famous around the world.\n\nIn Pakistan first favorite method is Spotlight hunting with Jeeps (Easy kiddy enjoyment)\n\nDriven Hunt (thrilling but little bit expensive; for this kind of hunt you need expertise and good team for real enjoyments)\n\nStalking (its real time adventure and the real available hunt with full of thrill; but must you need passions, good stemma & A grade health + field information).', ''),

(347109, ' I find somewhat similar to this on \n\nparallaxscurioandrelicfirearmsforums.yuku.com\n\nThe Pakistani POF website indicates that the velocity of this ammo is 395m/s or rougly 1300fps.  Some sources describe this ammo as containing a 124gr bullet.  If so, this is really hot for 9mm and would put it around the level of 9mm NATO ammo which exceeds SAMMI specifications - I don''t want to put that through my aluminum alloy Walther P-1.  \n\nTo check bullet weight, I took a round apart.  The bullet weighed 116gr (had some sealant or something on it).  It is probably 115gr.  There are 6 grains of a small flake powder. \n\nA 115 grain 9mm bullet at 1300fps is still hot.  My reloading manuals show loads topping out at about 1270fps.  However, the POF website does not say what firearm was used for the testing.  They describe 1z ammo as for use in the Walther 38.

(347138, 'Rifle Scope - How to Adjust for Elevation &amp; Windage With a regular metal rifle sight (called iron sight)  the shooter has to line up the rear and the front sight with the target. With a optical telescopic sight, the shooter simply aims the cross air of the rifle scope on the target.\r\n\r\nBeside the simplicity of aiming, optical sight has another big advantage. The view of the target is clearer, as the rifle scope provided magnification to the shooter''s eye. With a clearer view, the shooter has better opportunity of placing the bullet on the target.\r\n\r\nAssume you have already secured the scope mounts on the rifle''s receiver and that the scope has been secured to the mounts with the rifle scope rings. Before the rifle-scope combo can be used properly, the scope need the be aligned so that it is properly positioned in elevation (up-down) and windage (left-right) position at the distance you want to have the bullet be on the mark. You can read my earlier post that shows how you can save some ammunition using the "mirror trick" in aligning the scope.\r\n\r\nThis discussion centers on how each click/mark on the scope elevation and windage adjustment knob translates into certain amount of distance movement on the target. Many rifle scope are marked with "1/4 minute" graduations.  Each adjustment (click/mark) represents a distance shift of 1/4 inch (in elevation or in windage) at a distance of 100 yards. To shift the cross hair 1 inch would require movement of knob (elevation or windage) by 4 clicks/marks.\r\n\r\nWhat if you want to zero the scope for 50 yards? In this case  each click of the adjustment knob would represent movement of the cross hair of the scope by 1/8 inch. To shift the cross hair of the scope 1 inch at 50 yard would require 8 clicks of adjustment.\r\n\r\nIf your scope is set for distance of 100 yards and you want to shift the aim point one inch at 400 yards, you would move scope knob by one click.   \r\n\r\nAdjustment of rifle scope for elevation and windage is simple. Just get know how much one click/mark of the adjustment knob represents at the distance you have in mind.', ''),

(347183, ' Dr. Malik,\r\n\r\nSalam\r\nI am a new member. I have read about the air rifles made in Sargoda. I got introduced to air guns in the early 1950s at age 10-11. Both my air rifles and air pistol were made by BSA. I used them so much that on both guns I wore out the pivot points. There was no "karigar" in Bahawalpur in those days that could repair my guns.\r\n\r\nCan you kindly tell when/how you got interested in air guns? My only affiliation with Sargoda is that my father was in civil service there before I was born, in 1940. You are first person I have come across (in person or on the net)  who is from Sargoda. I am at some distance from you, otherwise I would come in person to shake your hand. \r\nRegards,', ''),

(347187, '100-Yard Sighted Scope - Count Clicks &amp; Sight for 90,80,70,60,50 Yards At times we may need to zero our rifle scope for a different distance. My Thompson 22LR Classic has scope that is mounted 1.5 inches above the barrel bore. The scope has elevations and windage adjustments in increments of  1/4 minute. This means that at 100 yards one click adjustment of elevation or windage will result in 1/4 inch shift of the impact point.\r\n\r\nAt this time my rifle is sighted for distance of 100 yards. I used an online ballistics calculator and determined the  ballistics for Winchester 40-grain round nose bullet with bullet coefficient of 0.138. Bullet coefficient (BC) is a numerical measure of the bullet shape in overcoming resistance to air in the flight path. Muzzle velocity of this ammo is 1,255 feet per second.\r\n\r\nIn the calculator (temperature set at 23 degrees celsius) I adjusted the zero point to 90, 80, 70, 60 and 50 yards and determined the amount of bullet drop for 100 yards. The drop of the bullet at these distance was in inches. I converted the drop in inches to the number of clicks down for those drops. Here are the results.\r\n\r\n90 yards   5 clicks down\r\n80 yards 10 clicks down\r\n70 yards 14 clicks down\r\n60 yards 18 clicks down\r\n50 yards 22 clicks down\r\n\r\nIf your rifle is zeroed in at 100 yards, you use same  ammunition and your scope has adjustment in increments of 1/4 minute then you just count the number of clicks given above to change to a new sighted distance. \r\n\r\nProblem solved by just counting clicks.', ''),

(347189, ' There are certain differences in the two rifles. the No. 1 uses a hammerless falling-block that harks back to the farquharson design of the 19th century, although with modern updates and engineering. The value of design is that it is immensely strong to take cartridges fron .204 ruger to .458 lott.\r\n\r\nLoading is also different as to load No.1 lever latch is pressed and the nder-lever is swing downward to its full. This exposes the breech end of chamber into which cartridge is inserted. Then lever is raised back up to closed position. Safety is also thumb operated. Ruger No. 1 is extremely solid gun for beginners to the most experienced. It is more similiar to Winchester Model 1885 while Baikal is similiar to any single shot, break open  shotgun.', ''),

(347192, 'Hunt Story - Missile Speed Yellow Jackets We are familiar with Remington 22LR Yellow Jacket hyper velocity ammunition - 1,500 feet per second at the muzzle. We drool at this kind of stuff. After you read this, see if you still want to drool or change your mind and laugh or pray.\n\nSome time ago, I went deer hunting with a friend. The hunt took us to a forest that was about about 750 miles by vehicle. On the third day of hunt we were deep into the forest, just below the tree line. We had not seen another person all day. We knew the general direction we came from where our pickup was parked on a dirt trail that was use by forest rangers. The sun was setting. Up high where we were, rays of the sun were still visible. Down below us there was no sun.  All day long we had been climbing and going downhill all day long. We were every tired and wanted to sit and rest. We came to a clearing where we found big dead trees lying on the forest floor. I headed toward a big log and my buddy followed. The tree must have been about five feet in diameter. I hopped on to the top and sat down with my rifle against the log. My friend did the same. As I sat on the log and shifted my body to get comfortable, I kicked the log with the heels of my boots. \n\nWith that kick something happened that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I heard a buzz near my ear, then another buzz, then another. With a thump I jumped off the log and to the ground - my  boots first. I flipped my hands toward my ears to ward off what I thoughts were some bugs. We picked up our rifles and decided to find another spot to rest. As we turned around to look for a more comfortable spot, we saw not just bugs but yellow jackets - swarm of them.  \n\nThey were after us. We were racing full speed downhill with our rifles on our shoulders. We were picking speed. The swarm of yellow jackets had the same idea and were going in the same direction - our direction. They too were going downhill and picking up speed. But they were even faster than the Remington Yellow Jackets. We both were wearing short sleeve shirts. The only protection from attack we could think of was to be in the pickup cab. By the time both doors to cab were opened, they - the yellow jackets were with us in the cab and under our shirts. \n\nWe had a choice to make - get out of the cab and quickly throw our shirts on the ground or try take the shirts off inside the cab and counter attack the yellow jackets that were under our shirts. Our split second decision was to counter-attack as the army outside the pickup cab was growing larger. We took off our shirts and killed them all inside the cab. But, they had already unloaded their ammo into our bodies. We could feel the stings. I was mentally calculating the time it would take us to get out of the forest and find a health facility before we become unconscious. I was also worried that the sun had already set and it was getting darker. In our rush to get out of the forest to go for help, we did not want get lost in the winding dirt trails of the forest.\n\nIt must have been about an hour before we left the forest behind and were on a main road. Our bodies that were itchy and burning from stings were starting to cool down. We came to a spot where, if needed, we could call for help. As time passed, we felt relieved that the attack of the yellow jackets had not made unconscious or worst still.\n\nWhenever I pick up a box of 22LR hyper velocity Remington Yellow Jackets, my mind flashes back to the time when we came across missile-speed yellow jackets. \n\nWe went hunting equipped for cut, bruises and snake bites, but not for an attack by an army of yellow jackets. Now the emergency kit includes a supply of antihistamine.', ''),

In all I must have had 6-8 10/22s at one time or another. The ones I missed most were collection of Mossberg 22LRs that I bought from an old-timer. I showed interest in his collection. Eventually he sold them all to me. These were early Mossberg rifles that were quality-built. At one I also had a Winchester 69A with peep eye sights. The world famous Winchester 75 was based on the 69A design. Production of the 75 ended in 1980 (if my recollection is correct). \r\n\r\nI am glad learn that you like 22s just like I do.

(347286, 'Know Limits of Rifle Scope - Avoid Damage We all want to keep our "gun-things" undamaged. If you have rifle scope, it will pay to know the limits of that optical instrument.\n\nIn discussions about rifle scopes we talk about fixed power, varialbe power, eye relief distance, objective lens diameter, elevation and windage adjustment graduations, exit pupil diameter, brightness and other such matters.   \n\nIn earlier posts I discussed about necessary elevation adjustments for achieving a certain zero distance. It needs to emphasized that your rifle scope may not have the range or number of clicks available for the needed adjustment.Trying to exceeding those limits could damage your scope.\n\nWhen I was shopping for a scope for my last 22LR rifle, I paid attention to number of clicks available on that scope. The scope mounted on my 22LR has 410 clicks available for elevation and windage in 1/4 minute increments.  This  translates into available adjust of 102.5 inches at 100 yards. This gives me the opportunity to count my clicks and zero the scope for longer distances - past the current zero distance.\n\nThe current version the scope I have mentioned here does not have the same adjustment range - it is limited. The filed-of-view is still the same - at 100 yard and at 3 power field-of-view is 39 feet; and at 9 power it is 13 feet.\n\nKnow the limits of your scope - avoid damage.', ''),

Say ''In them is great sin, and some profit, for men; but the sin is greater than the profit.''"  (Qur''an 2:219)\n\n &#8220;O&#8217; ye who believe!

(347326, ' Salam All,\n@PakistanFirst - I remember whilst living in Gatorland (Gainesville, FL) and roaming the acres and acres of land I always carried a .22lr for snakes after my first brief encounter with a rattler.  Initially, I used to walk around in shorts & flipflops having been advised several times by the ranch owner that one of these days I would get bit either by a rattler or a water moccasin.  \nI came upon my first rattler when I was cleaning up my full size shooting targets off the ground near a pond.  I remember, changing colors like a chameleon.  I ran back to the house picked up off all things a daisy pump air rifle mistaking it for the Browning pump .22lr.  I got back to the pond, realized my mistake but still decided to stand my ground and pumped pressure into the airgun and fired at the snake... I missed!  I ran back and decided to pick up my single barrel Stevens I had bought from KMart for farm use (Franchi Spas12 was toooo heavy to lug around) ran to the snake and fired... I missed again!  I reloaded and fired again, this time I got lucky, I believe only ONE of the shot pellets got the snake just behind the head.  This caused the snake to go into some sort of violent convulsions.  Hahahaha, I remember dropping the Stevens and running back home to get the machete and a stick.  My dogs ran back with me to the snake, I pickup the dead snake and the proceeded to remove its head from the body.\nFrom then on, rather than lugging around my HEAVY Ruger .22lr bull barrel pistol, I purchased a very very fine gun based on advice from the Range Master at the Alachua County Police Academy... Bernardelli Mod. USA (imported by Magnum Research).  What a great gun, I could shoot plates with it at OVER a 100yards!  \nBoss, you bring up some seriously good memories from times gone by.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/0006.jpg[/IMG]\nMe 26 years ago!!\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/00011.jpg[/IMG]\nMy Siberian Husky, this dog could run, really run.\n\n[IMG]http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/pyramids99/00015.jpg[/IMG]\nMy Lab/Husky mix, she had one blue eye and one black.', ''),

(347429, 'Rifle Shoots High/Low - No More Sight Adjustment Available You may have a rifle that shoots either too high or too low for the desired distance and you have no more adjustment positions left on the rifle sight to bring it into zero. What to do? I faced this situation when I acquired a used 22LR rifle.\n\nThe rule is that you adjust the rear sight in the same direction that you want the bullet to move - lower the rear sight to lower the point of impact and raise it to raise the point of impact. The same rule also says that you can adjust the front sight in the opposite direction - raise the front site to lower the point of impact and lower it to raise the point of impact.\n\nLet us say you have lowered the rear sight as far as it will go down and still the rifle shoots too high, say two inches. Common open rear sight is either a "V" or a "U'' notch on a metal leaf that is dovetailed at one end into the barrel and the other end is bend upward where you see "V'' or "U" notch. Customarily this rear sight leaf is tensioned against the barrel. A small slot is cut into the leaf in which a small metal slider is inserted. This metal slider has small notches of varying heights at the top. Generally when the slider is moved toward the muzzle, the rear sight moves up. When it is moved backward, the sight position is lowered. If the rifle shoots too low, put something under the slider to raise the height. Read further to see what that "something" thickness should be.\n\nIn our case the rear sight slider is in its lowest position and we still can not bring the shot to the desired position by two inches at 100 yards. Now we need to make measurements and calculations to determine how much deeper the "V'', "U" or the slider notch needs to be.\n\nMeasure the distance between the front sight and rear sight. This measurement is called the sight radius. For sake of this example, let us say the sight radius is 20 inches.\n\nThere are 3,600 inches in 100 yards. This translates into" 3600/20 - 180 radius lengths.\n\nFor 180 sight radius lengths the need correction is two inches. For one radius length the correction needed is 2 / 180 = 0.011 inch. We need to make the "V", "U" or slider notch deeper by 0.011 inch to bring the point of impact in line with the desired position. \n\nIn my case, the previous owner had installed a high-grade rear peep sight that was adjustable in 1/4 minute increments (1/4 inch increment at 100 yards). The rifle appeared to have been factory drilled and threaded for mounting rear peep sight. The previous owner had removed the factory open rear sight. I tried to zero the rifle at 100 yards. Even with the lowest adjustment, I could not bring it to zero. I was shooting too high. The only option left for me was to replace the front sight that was higher by the amount I calculated for my needs.', ''),

Gas system is self-regulating and does not need manual adjustments. Gun is fitted with modified AK-style safety that has additional lever that permits faster "safety on" operation (mostly useful for IPSC shooters). Safety lever is also duplicated on the left side of the receiver. Other useful addition that is not found in AKor Saiga 12 is bolt hold-open devicewhich holds the bolt open when magazine is exhausted. Magazine housing is provided with extended magazine tunnel, which permits for faster magazine insertion (without typical AK-style rocking movement,necessary to lock the standard AK-type magazine). Furniture includes a detachable or fixed flash hider on the barrel, a side-folding skeletonized butt with polymer coating, and plastic pistol grip and forend. Bottom handguard and bottom of gas block are fitted with Picatinny-type accessory rails, additional rail is provided on the receiver top cover, which is hinged to the receiver at the front.Standard sights are of AK pattern as well, with front sight installed on the gas block and adjustable rear sight on the receiver. It is worth to note that Vepr 12 shotguns can use both proprietary 8-round magazines and Saiga 12 magazines, but Vepr magazines will not work in Saiga 12.\r\n  Vepr shotguns are produced in three basic versions, standard (with 430 mm /16,9" barrel with removable flash hider), Vepr 12 mod.01 (with 520 mm /20,5" barrel with fixed flash hider) and Vepr 12 mod.02 (with 680mm / 26,8" barrel with interchangeable chokes).', ''),

The more bullets you can put in the assailant''s body in the same spot, the better chances you have of survival.

The reliability of a 1911 depends on feeding accuracy which pertains to the feed ramp especially, the barrel fitting which is important so you dont blow your gun up and the barrel bushing fitting for accuracy so your barrel doesnt have any movement. So it aint just about changing them parts but gettin em snug up inside there too. Meaning the fitting should be perfect cuz you know there aint nothing like a stock part for a 1911.

(347687, ' Moen & Survivalist,\n\nSalam\n\nYou are both on firm ground for the reasons you cite. There is no question that a shorter barrel like in 22LR handgun will produce lower velocity than a longer barrel on a rifle. And, if someone can hit a 100-yard target with a 10-inch barrel handgun and peak velocity/energy is not a concern,  then my all means use the shorter barrel. \n\nRaging debate about the optimum 22LR rifle barrel length revolves around the point where no additional velocity is gained. Having a longer barrel from that point forward, velocity is lost due to friction.\n\nSome have experimented to test for this optimal length. Tests have shown (cutting long barrel one inch at a time and taking velocity measurements) that the ideal length is about 16 inches. It just so happens that a rifle (any caliber) with barrel length shorter than 16 inches is considered by law as illegal at this end.\n\nBeside peak velocity from the 16-inch barrel length and requirement of the law, there is another very good reason (in my thinking) why this length is optimal. In 22LR rifle barrel length discussions very few people cite the reason that I am thinking of. Can you deliberate on this point?', ''),
(347688, ' Very nice info by Tiger. Thanks for sharing your knowledge & I also thank Prince for his profound concern about indiscreet killing of this animal. \n\nAs many of you know, I&#8217;m quite attached with wild boar hunting, rather, it&#8217;s my profession and by its virtue I&#8217;ve studied various aspects of the wild boar &#8230; all the way from its taxonomy, habitat, conservation, it&#8217;s hunt as big game hunting and last but not the least, &#8230;. its "real status" in our religion. \n\nI&#8217;ll try to highlight only some very important issues very briefly since a lot has been already narrated by brother Tiger & Brother Prince so there is no need to repeat what they&#8217;ve already said or copy & paste long text from wikipedia .... lol \n\nIn my opinion, wild boar (all species) is the MOST PRECIOUS creation of Allah (JSH) for so many benefits of humans, animals & plant life. So in order to protect this &#8220;Precious Animal&#8221; Allah (JSH) has made it harram (forbidden to eat) and to flourish its population, Allah has designed its incredible birth system so secure & powerful that a sow (female boar) is impregnated TWICE A YEAR & each time it gives birth from 8 to 12 piglets, whereas, (with exception of many) most of the animals in the world, usually, breed once a year and many of them (with exception of many) give birth to two & sometimes as few as one offspring. \n\nBy nature, all wild boar species &#8220;love digging&#8221; (or plowing) using their tusks .. they dig the soil for several hours &#8230;.. every day .... non-stop for 365 days a year !!! So in other words, I would entitle the boar as the &#8220;Gardner of the Wild&#8221; (Jungle Ka Baghbaan) &#8230;! Just like the cultivation of every crop in the world needs a thorough plow (digging) & intensive care by its  farmers, the boar does plowing in the uninhabited and wild habitats, plains, jungles, meadows, ravines, alluvial fans, pastures, mountains, &#8230;. you name it & they are found almost in every geographical location on the face of this Earth (except some sand & snow deserts)\n\nBeing omnivorous, (animals who eat both meat & vegetables) their menu is composed of a large variety of edibles and they love to eat fresh roots & many young plants which may impede the growth of bigger trees. By eating the fresh & shallow roots of trees which spread horizontally on the forest floor, the boar prevents the entanglement of roots of various trees with each other, which becomes dominating for younger & weaker trees. As a result of this hard work by the boar, the roots tend to flourish deeper (vertically) into the soil which strengthens the trees, improves the water table of the area and also helps the younger & weaker trees to survive, rather, flourish. By eating the mushroom growth of many  fresh & young plants, shrubs & weeds, the boar keeps the jungle floor clear of many natural obstructions & improves the biodiversity of its flora & fauna. Obviously, the ultimate benefits of this hard working animal go to all the humans, animals, birds & plant life that share life with us on this Earth.\n\nSince I&#8217;ve been working all night on my PC & I&#8217;m quite tired, I need to take some sleep but InshAllah, I&#8217;ll reveal some very interesting & &#8220;surprising&#8221; facts about the wild boars &#8230; tomorrow. This will also include .. the &#8220;scientific reasons&#8221; on which Allah (JSH) has made this animal Harram ! & revelation of a new scientific research on the Nephrology of boars.\n\nWith kind regards, I thank you all for sharing !', ''),

My advice to you, go for both the benelli M2 if you think you''ll use it for hunting and get a pump for HD. \nA decent turkish pump will cost you only 25K - 30K, which is nothing compared to what you''ll be spending on the Benelli. I saw the akkar karatay (with folding stock) for 25K and the Hatsan Escort Aimguard for 28K a few days ago in Karachi.

Regardless of their contents, it&#8217;s a healthy sign that we are all discussing a topic in a friendly & respectable manner and at the same time also disagreeing each others [B]&#8220;without being disagreeable&#8221;[/B] .. I wish our country&#8217;s leadership learns manners from PG forums &#8230;. lol &#8230; can someone invite them and show them how democratic we are !!!\n\nWell, I&#8217;m back &#8230; fresh with good sleep & ready to resume the topic and I would like to add a few more points which might interest you, meanwhile, however, some of my friends have already  jumped to conclusions on what I meant when I highlighted the benefits of boars in our lives &#8230;. so here&#8217;s the remaining stuff !\n\nHaving said all, on one hand the boar&#8217;s natural habit of digging generates innumerable benefits for the mankind, animal & plant life, but on the other, this digging habit happens to be a great nuisance, especially for the farmers who lose their crops worth billions each year around the world. We all know that the boar destroys & wastes more crop than it eats ... I was surprised to know that the wasted (left over) crop, branches, leaves etc by the boars contaminated with their saliva is not eaten by any cow, goat, sheep, horse or other animals .. so the farmer''s losses are in fact doubled. I&#8217;ve seen them literally crying with tears &#8230; This is &#8220;one big reason&#8221; &#8230; rather, it is in fact in lieu of so many invitations we receive every year from farmers from many parts of Pakistan that we go for boar hunts & help them live in peace &#8230; at least for a few weeks ! \n\nHow many of us know that [U]wild boars destroy 30% of the total crop of Pakistan[/U] &#8230; [B]which is grown for 160 million people[/B]. So you may rest assured, they exist in Millions. So if a pest destroys your crop and also causes nuisance in one&#8217;s life, one has all the [U]Secular & Religious Rights[/U] to [B]&#8220;control&#8221;[/B] such pest .., here I used the word [B]&#8220;Pest Control&#8221;[/B] &#8230;.. & this may not be reckoned as total elimination of a specie regardless of the magnitude of its nuisance. \n\nBoar hunting also originated in lieu of its pest controlling and over years it became a sport since the hunters found thrill & challenge in hunting this specie. Now boar hunting has become a favorite sport around the world and there are various ways & styles of hunting this animal. However, nowhere in the world would any Government allow hunters to use means & methods which may endanger the natural growth of this specie. \n\nIt&#8217;s a pity, however, during recent years, a mushroom growth of unethical boar hunters has arisen in Pakistan which is endangering this specie at an alarming rate. These are some groups of boar hunters from Multan & surrounding areas who use [U][B]100 to 300 dogs[/B][/U] for hunting boars in various parts of Punjab. These dogs flush out the boars, chase them and ultimately kill them. The worst part of this dilemma is that piglets (baby boars) in large numbers are also killed which has a devastating affect on the natural growth of boars. These groups of boar hunters (approx 50 to 80 persons) start  their journey in a fleet of buses, cars & jeeps from Multan (& surrounding areas) and proceed on the organized & indiscreet killing of these animals. Their average score in each of the villages they touch is [B][U]300 to 400 boars.[/U][/B] By the time they return home after a week long trip, they&#8217;ve massacred over a thousand of boars. This practice continues from November till end February & several thousands of boars are killed in lieu thereof &#8230; This is indiscreet, inhumane & totally against the law but it&#8217;s so unfortunate no one stops them !\n\nPlease note this interesting fact that due to this indiscreet & gross killing of boars by these dog hunters ... most of the boars have migrated to undulating hills in Punjab & KPK where these dog hunters (mostly feudal lords) find it extremely difficult to chase them. [U]When most of my friends at PG ask me where I take my hunters for boar hunting I tell them go to these hills & you''ll still find them in big numbers ... ![/U]\n\nIn comparison, the genuine wild boar hunters (not the eliminators) both from Pakistan and from abroad hunt this animal within certain rules of the game & ethics & even if they don&#8217;t follow the rules &#8230; I can bet my life on this particular claim &#8230;. Even if they don&#8217;t follow the rules, these hunters, [U]&#8220;EVEN ALL TOGETHER[/U]&#8221; can&#8217;t shoot boars indiscreetly in thousands simply because we all know how much a rifle cartridge costs & we all know how challenging it is to shoot the boar with shotguns. So I can prove here that all the hunters using GUNS (discreet & indiscreet hunters) DO NOT pose any threat to these fast growing animals. \n\nFor the sake of reference, I would like to mention here the modus operendi and of my own hunting groups who come from abroad & we organize driven hunts for them. Please note, none of the foreign hunter&#8217;s groups (our own & from our competitors) have ever crossed a total score of over 150 boars during a trip of 4 to 5 days. Personally, I&#8217;ve fixed a bag limit of five boars per hunter per day. This indeed is a safe limit and gives ample bag to our guests and yet, does not disturb the natural growth of the boar. \n\nThe other benefit of our organized boar hunts is that after all that shooting of rifles and howling of beaters the farmers rest in peace for a few weeks & secure their crops till the next season begins and we disburse over Half a Million Rupees among the beaters, guides, drivers, cooks & other field staff who serve our hunts. With disbursement of such a reasonable amount to poor people at grass root level, I think I''m engaged in something quite ethical .. unless the true meaning of this term is changed !\n\nSo my dear PG Hunting Members may relax & continue boar hunting with whatever rifle & shotgun you may have &#8230;. Rest assured, [U][B]With All Your Combined Guns[/B][/U], you simply cannot overwhelm their population !\n\nWith my best regards, I&#8217;ll revert 2moro with some very surprising and interesting biological facts on boars &#8230; until, take care & Allah Hafiz !!!', ''),

(347949, ' thanks for appreciation Moeen Sir,\r\n\r\nReading following information I think a complete twist in barrel is not only factor that determines barrel length but other players may also be given consideration for the optimim. The information available is a bit complex and need your guidance (Moeen Sir & PakistanFirst Sir) to decipher.\r\n\r\nI would like to quote Chuckhawks on barrel length, he write;\r\n"[B][U]Barrel length, accuracy and ballistics[/U][/B] \r\nIt is worth mentioning that a longer barrel is not inherently more accurate than a short barrel. Intrinsic accuracy is a matter of quality, not length. However, a longer barrel is generally better in terms of practical accuracy, because a longer and therefore heavier barrel (within reason) is easier to hold relatively steady from unsupported positions; thus it is easier to shoot a long barreled rifle accurately.\r\n\r\nThe length of the rifle barrel has a direct influence on the velocity obtained from the cartridge for which it is chambered. Ballistically, for centerfire calibers, longer is usually better. However, for carrying, handling and maneuvering in close quarters (like thick brush or getting in and out of vehicles), shorter is usually better. Some sort of compromise must therefore be reached.\r\n\r\nVery long 27-30 inch barrels are seldom seen these days on repeating hunting rifles, although they are still occasionally found on single shot hunting rifles and target rifles. The longest barrels usually seen on hunting rifles today are 26 inches in length.\r\n\r\n26 inch barrels are usually found on rifles chambered for high velocity magnum cartridges. A long barrel is required to burn the large amounts of slow burning powder used in this type of cartridge. Unfortunately, most repeating rifles with 26 inch barrels balance too far forward; they are muzzle heavy and slow to swing. The long barrel seems to hang up on every limb and outcropping of rock in the area and a hunting rifle so equipped can be very awkward carry in steep terrain. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, many magnum rifles now come with 24 inch barrels, which sacrifice some of the magnum''s velocity. 24 inches is about the minimum barrel length practical for most magnum cartridges. Cut a magnum''s barrel down to 22 inches and the muzzle blast and flash become intimidating. Also, magnum cartridges such as the .264 Win. or 7mm Rem. lose so much velocity in a 22 inch barrel that they show little ballistic advantage over standard calibers like the .270 or .280.\r\n\r\nThe typical barrel length for a repeating hunting rifle chambered for high intensity cartridges, such as the .243, .270, .308, or .30-06, is 22-24 inches. These are useful all-around barrel lengths for such cartridges. The highest velocity standard cartridges (.243, .25-06, .270 Win.), which achieve muzzle velocities around 3000 fps, are at their best in a 24 inch barrel and 24 inches is the SAAMI standard for almost all American centerfire rifle calibers. However, for cartridges such as the .257 Roberts, 6.5x55, 7mm-08, .308 Win., .30-06, .338 Federal, .35 Whelen and .350 Rem. Mag., which typically operate at 2500-2800 fps, the velocity loss in a 22 inch barrel is not extreme and a rifle with a barrel of this length usually balances and swings well.\r\n\r\nCartridges with smaller cases that operate at lower velocity, such as all .22 Rimfire cartridges, the .30-30, .32 Special, .35 Rem. and similar numbers, do well in 20-22 inch barrels. The very popular carbine versions of classic lever action rifles like the Winchester 94 and Marlin 336 usually come with 20 inch barrels. These short rifles ride well in a saddle scabbard, are easy to carry in rugged terrain and handle very fast in close quarters. Because they are light rifles, they balance well with a 20 inch barrel. Muzzle blast from these cartridges in a 20 inch barrel is less severe than from the larger high intensity cartridges in a 22 inch barrel.\r\n\r\nCombine a high intensity cartridge with a 20 inch barrel, however, and the velocity drops noticeably while the blast becomes annoying. Still, a rifle with a 20 inch barrel, chambered for short action cartridges like the 7mm-08, .308 and .358 Win., makes a very effective mountain or woods rifle. These cartridges retain enough velocity in a 20 inch barrel for medium range shooting and the stubby barrel is less likely than longer tubes to get hung up on branches, overhanging ledges, rocky outcroppings and so forth.\r\n\r\nTo my mind it is hard to justify barrels shorter than 20 inches for any purpose. I have owned rifles with 18-19 inch barrels and in every case I wished that they had come with at least a 20 inch barrel. Very short barrels of standard contour (not bull barrels) tend to make the rifle muzzle light and unsteady to hold and swing. I like a rifle to balance between my hands, not toward the butt. Even .22 rimfire rifles balance better with 20-22 inch barrels, although in this instance the longer barrel has no ballistic advantage, since the .22 LR cartridge burns all of of its powder in about 16 inches. Very short barrels also increase the muzzle blast from high intensity cartridges to very annoying levels and the velocity loss is excessive."', ''),

(347954, ' Twist rate and bullet stabilityIn 1879, George Greenhill, a professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy (RMA) at Woolwich, London, UK[10] developed a rule of thumb for calculating the optimal twist rate for lead-core bullets. This shortcut uses the bullet''s length, needing no allowances for weight or nose shape.[11] The eponymous Greenhill Formula, still used today, is:\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n\r\nC = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)\r\nD = bullet''s diameter in inches\r\nL = bullet''s length in inches\r\nSG = bullet''s specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)\r\nThe original value of C was 150, which yields a twist rate in inches per turn, when given the diameter D and the length L of the bullet in inches. This works to velocities of about 840 m/s (2800 ft/s); above those velocities, a C of 180 should be used. For instance, with a velocity of 600 m/s (2000 ft/s), a diameter of 0.5 inches (13 mm) and a length of 1.5 inches (38 mm), the Greenhill formula would give a value of 25, which means 1 turn in 25 inches (640 mm).', ''),

(347957, ' Another factor to consider is Bullet Rotational Speed (RPM). Bullets leaving a rifled barrel can spin at over 100,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) depending on the muzzle velocity of the bullet and the pitch of the rifling. The rotational speed of the bullet can be calculated by using the formula below. The formula divides the number of inches in a foot (12) by the rate of twist that the barrel has. This number is multiplied by the muzzle velocity (MV) and the number of seconds in a minute (60). For example, a bullet with a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet per second (910 m/s) leaving a barrel that twists once per foot (1/12") would rotate at 180,000rpm.[5]\r\n\r\nMV x (12/twist rate in inches) x 60 = Bullet RPM\r\nExample using a barrel that has a twist rate of 1 turn in 8" with a muzzle velocity of 3000 ft/s:\r\n\r\n3000 x (12/8) x 60 = 270,000\r\nExcessive rotational speed can exceed the bullet''s designed limits and the resulting centrifugal force can cause the bullet to disintegrate in a radial fashion.', ''),

(348006, ' starfish,\n \nThe subject we have undertaken for discussion appears simple of the surface but is in fact is very complex. Over the decades governments and arms manufacturers have spent billions in money on research. Individuals have spent billions of hours in testing ammunitions and rifles to come up with "happy combinations". For various calibers, common bullet weights and bullet shapes, there is general agreement on certain rifling twists for many calibers. Within the industry certain rifling twist rates have been standardized - an example is the 22LR, 1:16. Some in the industry have chose a different paths with rifling twists of their own - an example is .223/5.56X45, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1:10 and 1:12 with 1:10 and 1:12 being more common. Bullet weight and bullet shape in this caliber plays a big role having a stable projectile in flight path. The popular .308 Winchester (7.62X51) has twist ratio of 1:12 and the 30-06 Springfield has a twist ratio of1:10.\n \nLet us throw away the subjective elements (rifle balance, muzle flash, etc.) from the equation and just deal with achieving velocity and bullet stability. Maximum velocity does not translate into maximum bullet stability. To get the results more refined, we need to select the bullet weight and bullet shape. Now we come to realize that arms manufacturers can not offer diverse combination of barrel twist ratios other than a select few (for example .223, 7mm Remington magnum).\n \nYou can custom order almost any barrel twist ratio, if money pocket is deep enough. But, would you know in advance if the twist ratio your are ordering will give you most stable bullet? Perhaps, not. Perhaps you will need to sacrifice velocity for stability. If highest velocity and highest bullet stability is the objective, you may have to experiment on your own by reloading and keeping resulting records like a scientist would maintain in a loboratory. \n \nNo two rifles of same make and model with same ammunition will guarantee similar results. If this the case, how can we say that in this caliber and with this bullet, you get the best combo for maximum velocity and maximum bullet stability. May be you do get it. I have the same make and model of rifle as you do. We bought them the same day from the same dealer. How come my rifle with your ammo does not give same result on the target as your rifle?\n \nThere is no easy answer. There are generalities we can agree on. We can apply all the formulas we want. In the end, we want to see the results. Maximum velocity and maximum bullet stability - perhaps not. Less than maximum velocity and maximum bullet stability - likely yes. I have not come across a formula that will guarantee me what I am looking for if I were to plug the data for caliber, muzzle velocity, barrel length, bullet weight, bullet shape and size , twist rate, propellant used . What if my need is for 100 yards, or 500 yards. Hunting or target shooting? \n \nIn summary, we can discuss this topic in genral terms. There are too many variables. Science is not yet advanced to the stage where we can get answer to our questions by just plugging in all the variables and all that we looking for in that particular rifle-ammo combination. If it were true science, we should be able to replicate results of your rifle-ammo combo with my rifle-your ammo combo - both rifles brand new, same caliber, same make and model, bought the same day.', ''),

(348046, '&quot;Keeping vs. Carrying firearms&quot; and a few other things... Hi all members of PakGuns. Assalam-o-Alaikum!\r\n\r\nI see that in other countries (USA for example) there are separate regulations for buying/keeping and carrying concealed firearms. Does that apply in Pakistan, too.?\r\nIf that is the case, does a normal NPB license allow me to carry the concealed weapon inside the jurisdictional territory? Or do I have to take measures for that privilege.\r\n\r\nAnother question that I wanted to ask is, what is the case with an All-Pakistan license? Is there such a thing? I heard from a friend about someone that I have mere acquaintance with, that he has an All-Pakistan NPB license, since he has to travel a lot. Wouldn''t that be difficult to manage because of the different standards of PB vs NPB in different provinces of Pakistan?\r\n\r\nThirdly, there used to be a section in the old version of PakGuns forums, where instructions and form was provided for someone who wants to get a license issued. I can''t find it now. Can someone direct me to it, please? Or is that section deleted for some administrative reasons? \r\n\r\nThat''s all. Thank you very much.', ''),
(348047, '22LR - Shoot 150 Yards? 22LR - Shoot 150 yards? Yes, possible - if you know the ballistics of your ammo and distance to target. If you know the ballistics, but not the distance - you may miss the target.\n \nWhen we buy a rifle, we decide on the ammo to use. We take the rifle out and sight is for the intended distance. With the rifle properly sighted we should be hitting that target with consistency, within the rifle''s accuracy limitations.\n \nWe take the same rifle-ammo combination into the field for hunting. Now the ball game has changed. We know the distance for which the rifle was sighted. But, we do not know the exact distance to target in the field.

If not - the hunt may end in sad failure.\n \nLet us say we are using Winchester 37-grain (X22LRH) lead hollow point ammo. The rifle sight is 1.5 inches above the bore of the barrel.

With this setup our bullet drop in inches for the give distance will be:\n \nSighted for 100 yards:\nMuzzle -1.5\n25 Yards 1.35\n50 Yards 2.68\n75 Yards 2.29\n100 Yards 0.00\n125 Yards -4.37\n150 Yards -10.98\n175 Yards -20.01 \n200 Yards -31.62\n \nSighted for 150 Yards:\nMuzzle -1.5\n25 Yards 3.18\n50 Yards 6.34\n75 Yards 7.78\n100 Yards 7.32\n125 Yards 4.78\n150 Yards 0.00\n175 Yards -7.2\n200 Yards -16.97\n \nFirst we use the rifle sighted for 100 yards. We see a rabbit (facing us) - a target of about 4 inches. If the distance to rabbit is within 125 yards, we are likely to hit that rabbit. If we underestimate the distance and the rabbit is farther away, we will miss it.\n \nNow we use the same rifle, but have sighted it for 150 yards. The rabbit is the same and at the same distance (facing us). If the rabbit is at range of 50 to 100 yards (more like 50-110 yards, if 5-yard intervals were listed) from us, we will miss the shot. If you know the ballistics of your ammo, and can do good estimation of distance, you may be able to make appropriate compensation - in cases where the sighted distnace is closer/farther than the distance to the hunt animal.\n \nThe longer the sighted distance, the higher the bullet has to be launched. This higher angles gives us greater range at the expense of trajectory that is not as flat as compared to trajectory of a rifle sighted for shorter distance. \n \nIf the objective is to shoot longer distances and hit the mark, it becomes essential to be able to estimate distance to target. See my prior posts about estimating distance - without any distance measuring tool.', ''),

(348143, 'Buying Used Gun Shooters like to save money. In this hobby we spend (actually burn) money.We are always looking for another gun to acquire. To stretch our addiction and our money, we look for ways to get what we want - for less. We are not always looking for opening a new box. We will be satisfied if there is no cardboard box to open as long as the price is right. \n \nIn forums like this one, questioning goes like this:\nI want one - how much did you pay?\nCan you give me name of that gun dealer?\nCan you buy one for me for the same price?\nCan I get it for same price here (your city)?\nCan you order one for me at the same price?\nWill he (gun dealer) sell me at the price you paid?\n \nWhat is going on? What are we trying to do? We go from bazar to bazar, from dealer to dealer, from city to city - looking of a good deal, trying to save money. \n \nAn alternative to dealing with a gun dealer or haggeling with one is to look for some individual that wants to get rid of his gun because he no longer needs it, is not happy with it or wants to convert it into cash to buy another gun. Many gun owners are not aware of the potential/quality of the firearms they own or their real value in the used market.\n \nMembership groups, gun clubs and shooting ranges are ideal avenues in finding individuals that want to part from their guns. Once you have located the prospective seller, your next task is to learn more about that firearm than the owner. Next come the inspection and testing at the gun range. Once you are satisfied that the gun meets your criteria , you begin to negotiate price. If you are not a good negotiator, bring a frind along who can point out to the seller the negatives - scratches, dings, worn metal bluing, etc. If I was near, you could take me along for this phase of the deal-making.', ''),

Whilst you were training along with Butt Sb, another chap from here of my local area, Jabir Ali (A title holder), was being supervised by me and we trained lots together. The guy was benching max 60Kg''s, before I took him over, and in less than 8 weeks, I had him pressing out 6 reps with 130Kg''s, squatting some 150 as well. His major weakness was, and still is, and of what is normally a trouble to Pakistani BB''s, the very [I]calfs[/I]! These are never given due attention to, yet in international run ups, it''s usually such things which come into final focus.\n\nAnyhow, I personally used[I] L-Arginine[/I] amino''s mostly, along with 90% Protein powder, some pre-exercise carb fuel, etc, sticking basically to natural nutrients instead, and in those days the variety of high tech nutrients was also very basic only, much more advanced today, no doubts.\n\nBtw, what is this[I] Megamen[/I] thing, basically? And as far as evading breathing issues, bro, you gotta cut down on the intoxicating habit of yours, no match to anything at all.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n \nThank you big brother for your kind reply :)\n\nIts great to hear you have trained professionally. And I can only imagine how Mr. Jabir Ali must have had a total change in training attitude shifting from an amateur mode to a professional one ;) so thumbs up to you... :thumb:\n\nThe max Weight I have done with Mr. Butt was 240ks on smith machine, 200ks on free bench press, 140ks on inclined. But I have squatted with over 300ks with him... and I was only 15 or so back then :) He really knew how to push the trainee to the limits... Afterwards when I returned to weight training after some 5/6 years I got to 400ks on squats and that was a real achievement for me. However I still regret somewhat doing that much weight so early in my life... I have had some real issues with my back...\n\nI come from a doctors family. My father (God Bless his Soul) was a doctor and my mom is a specialist. So they included multi vits into my diet from a pretty early age. I dont recall what pills they used to feed me when I was a child or a teenager, but since I turned 18 they fed me with GNC tabs. GNC is General Nutrient Company or something... I believe their website is located at gnc.com. They have a couple of outlets in Lahore and are pretty good. MEGAMEN is their multi vit pill, a competitor to AtoZ. Pretty general stuff only really really potent.\n\nBro I really appreciate your advise about smoking. That shows your care for which I am extremely thankful. I almost quit just before my father passed away... after his demise it was a ride downhill... was working on my M. Phil. Dissertation and keeping two jobs so basically needed that nicotine. I am coming back to quitting. To use your will power you need to concentrate and circumstances need to provide that space for you for your concentrative efforts. I just basically been lacking that. Its hard for me to quit cuz I am a nicotine addict. And no matter what people say, there is a huge chemistry change when you quit. Nicotine gums are an excellent aid. So lets see how it goes :) I definitely plan to quit before marriage InshaAllah cuz smokes are killers for your spouse and your children. Especially the infants. \n\nThank you once again AK bhai... \n\nRegards,\nCD.', ''),

(348189, 'Extreme Conditions and Extended Duration Storage [B]AoA Everybody[/B] \r\n\r\nA year ago I was sorta obsessed (among other things ;)) with the idea of "Long Term Storage". I wanted to know how I can store stuff without the risk of corrosion. In the search for a solution, I found out that normal preservatives such as gun oils and stuff are pretty much useless for extended durations. I found out that that sealing a bag air-tight and sucking out all the air to create a vacuum is not possible at "home-made" level. I found out that preservatives that do work for extended durations are a PAIN to get rid of once they are no longer required. I found out that ordinary polyethylene bags are not moisture proof as some of us may think, we need a minimum thickness of 200 microns to do that and that thickness is quiet significant. I found out that sealing a bag means you are essentially trapping moisture inside which will eventually start corrosion.\r\n\r\nthen some thing struck me, [B][URL="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/default.aspx?productNumber=154282"]VCI[/URL][/B]. [B][URL="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/default.aspx?productNumber=154282"]Volatile Corrosion Inhibitor[/URL][/B] to be precise. if this thing works as claimed then we can store stuff in extreme conditions and don''t have to worry about a thing. all we need to do is to seal VCI inside a polyethylene bag thick enough to ensure zero transmission along with the stuff we need to store away for extended and extreme storage conditions.\r\n\r\n[B]what is [URL="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/default.aspx?productNumber=154282"]VCI[/URL]:[/B] Volatile Corrosion Inhibitors (VCIs) (sometimes referred to as vapor corrosion inhibitors) provide excellent protection for metal surfaces and can prevent corrosion for many years. VCIs are chemicals used directly on the product that needs to be protected. They are designed to create an invisible barrier, keeping moisture at bay. VCI molecules attach themselves to metal surfaces to form an invisible, thin film only a few molecules thick.\r\n\r\nSo, to test that I claim, I gathered a few things of metal, Stainless steel and Mild steel nails, some blued parts, some browned parts, one parkerized guide rod, one chrome plated nail and some unfired ammo (for shiny brass). each and every piece was chemically degreased to ensure that they were free of any preservative of any sort. they were handled using latex gloves to further ensure that no human residue was left on there. I wanted to give VCI the best level playing field that I could possibly provide.\r\n\r\n[B]One Year Extreme Conditions and Extended Duration Test:[/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00636.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00637.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00639.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00640.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00641.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00642.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00643.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00644.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00645.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00646.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00647.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00648.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af103/12gauge-pakguns/Long%20term%20Storage%20Test/Dsc00649.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAfter one year, everything came out shinny just like the first day. not even a single spot of rust anywhere, no discoloration and no signs of corrosion. VCI worked beautifully and just as claimed. the stuff came out ready to use and not requiring any post cleaning as with regular long term preservatives that require complete dismantling and multiple cleaning sessions to get rid of all old preservative which normally turns into a hard coating.\r\n\r\n[B]Directions:[/B]\r\n\r\nGet a few [URL="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/default.aspx?productNumber=154282"]VCI[/URL] time release tabs (or chips) and heat seal them alongside the stuff you want to store away, making sure that you seal it good and leave no skin oil/residue on the stuff while handling. one more thing, you do need a polyethylene bag of 200 microns thickness which I was fortunate enough to get from our very own Denovo87 Sb.\r\n\r\nI know some of you might be wondering why a lawn was chosen for such a test. well.... first it probably provides the most extreme environment that I can possibly throw at VCI. secondly, only by pushing through the limits we truly establish the limits. :)\r\n\r\nThink of it as this way: this test came out great in an extreme environment of a lawn even after storing for a full one year. Imagine how long VCI can protect your stuff if stored and kept away from sunlight, humidity and extremes of temperatures. Imagine being able to store your stuff and use it right away when needed without requiring any post-storage cleaning.\r\n\r\n[B]Regards.[/B]', ''),

(348217, '30/30 Reticle Rifle Scope - Measure Distance Key advantage of rifle scope over iron sight is clear - no need to align rear sight-front-sight-target. With rifle scope, you just aim at the reticle (crosshair) on the target. Rifle scope also gives the advantage of magnification - better resolution of the target.\n\nRifle scope are available in different styles of reticles. A popular reticle style is called the 30/30 - also known as the duplex reticle. This style has a fine-line crosshair in the middle and a bold crosshair toward the ends of the scope. The fine-line crosshair represents 30 inches at distance of 100 yards when the magnification of the scope is set at 4X.\n\nWhere I am, a male mature deer trunck (from top of body to bottom of body) represents about 15 inches. In the scope eyepiece if the deer body fits within the crosshair center and the end of the fine-line crosshair, the distance to target is 100 yards. If the same deer is at 50 yards, the entire length of the fine-line crosshair will cover the deer''s body. \n\nI have prepared the following distance measuring chart for 30/30 reticle scopes.\n\nFine-line cross-hair End-to-End:\nTarget 10 inches @ 3X - Distance 50 Yards\nTarget 30 Inches @ 4X - Distance 100 Yards\nTarget 30 inches @ 6X - Distance 75 Yards\nTarget 10 inches @ 6X - Distance 25 Yards\nTarget 30 inches @ 8X - Distance 50 Yards\nTarget 10 inches @ 9X - Distance 150 Yards\n\nFine-line cross-hair  Center to End:\nTarget 5 inches @ 3X - Distance 50 Yards\nTarget 15 inches @ 4X - Distance 100 Yards\nTarget 15 inches @ 6X - Distance 75 Yards\nTarget 5 inches @ 6X - Distance 25 Yards\nTarget 15 inches @ 8X - Distance 50 Yards\nTarget 5 inches @ 9X - Distance 150 Yards\n\nThere are many reticle styles available on the market, some for measuring distance. The 30/30 reticle style is popular as it has been in use for a long time. I have used it since the mid 1950s. The 30/30 will measure the distance - you need to know/judge the size of the target.', ''),

(348258, 'Ruger 10/22 Likes &amp; Dislikes We all have our favorite - 22LR rifle. Even with the favorite one, we wish the manufacture took away all of our dislikes and added our likes to that rifle. Case in point is the Ruger 10/22. \n\nI have owned quiet a few of these rifles from the time they came into the market. Few years after the initial offering, I saw an advertisement somewhere for their sporter version. I could hardly wait to get that one. And, I did. Having a 10/22 was kind of a love-hate affair.\n\nUp to the time of the 10/22 introduction, what the market place offered was the same old stuff. The 10/22 changed the whole ball game. Here was a rifle that allowed you to  add features by buying accessories from other companies. The rotary magazine was totally novel for a 22LR. Even with what was offered by others to upgrade the 10/22, something was still lacking.\n\nI dislike the receiver not being solid steel. I also dislike the way the barrel is mounted - 2 screw V block. Why not solid steel receiver and thread-mounted barrel into the solid steel receiver?\n\nLooking for perfect 22LR - I did find one. The Thompson Center 22 Classic. I bought one few years ago. Once you get your hand on the Classic, you could swear that you could not do without one. Everything in the classic is precision from one end to the other. The Classic was replaced by the R-55. Even though the R-55 appears in the current catalog, it is no longer available.\n\nYou have a love-hate 10/22 relationship?', ''),
(348259, ' Norinco NP44 is an excellent gun for its price. I wanted to buy one myself but couldn''t find a brand new NP44 in Lahore. I found a couple which were used thoroughly for around 15k each. One of my friends thought it was a sweet deal but I had known better through my experiences with used guns. Unless the dealer would lemme take it apart and inspect it closely for defects, I would not go near a used gun ever in my life.\n\nSo I think you should buy a NP44 if it is being offered brand new. It is an excellent gun for the price you pay. And Norinco is no novice to the firearms market neither. Their repute is excellent. However, do the reliability tweaks on the gun after you have ''broken'' it in. And it will be as reliable as anything else!', ''),

Carrying a double-stacked 1911 concealed is nearly impossible. I know from experience. What makes a huge handgun like 1911 concealable for larger framed people is its slim profile. The double-stack feature takes that slimness away from the design. Where it adds to the firepower and thence eliminates one of the cases made against a forty-five, it disturbs the ergonomics and concealment profile of the gun immensely. I would never buy a double stacked 1911 for cc. However, the gun in question (NP44) is pretty desirable for me as an HD gun.\n\nSo I am in total agreement with you Enigmatic Desires brother :)', ''),

(348387, ' I''ve never been impressed with the accuracy of 10/22''s so I''m pretty much done with them. Yeah, you can get great groups if you pour a ton of money in to one or just buy a Volquartsen Custom, but I''m getting one-hole accuracy for a whole lot less in other rifles. \n \nBest example I have is the Marlin Model 25. You can buy these new today, but they redesigned the trigger so you can''t work on it. If you look around you can find these used really cheap, just make sure the muzzle crown is uniform and the barrel lands are good. Marlin 22 barrels are micro groved, which means there are 2-3 times more lands which give a uniform gas seal for much improved accuracy over non-micro groved barrels. \n \nThe triggers typically break clean but are too heavy, but you can fix that with a screwdriver and a retractable ballpoint pen. Remove the bolt, unfasten the barreled action from the stock, and the screw in the trigger assembly. Remove the spring from the pallpoint pen and shorten the length of it to around 5/8" to 3/4", replace the heavy steel spring with pen spring and reassemble your rifle. The trigger should now break around 2 lbs. You adjust the pull by trimming the length of your spring. \n \nTap out the dovetailed rear sight, unscrew the front sight, mount a good scope with steel tipoff rings using an alignment tool, and you''re ready for a test drive from a benchrest. Use match grade ammo like Eley Tenex. I bought a used Model 25 for 65 bucks at a local pawn shop, topped it with a 6-18x44 AO with fine duplex, gave it to my GF, and she is able to light a strike-anywhere stick match at 30 yards with it off a rest. Try that with a 10/22.\n \nSince my early Model 25 days I stepped up to an 880SQ barrel and action with a chromed sear mounted in a laminated stock, courtesy of the Marlin Custom Shop, topped with an 8-32x44 AO Mil dot I still shoot today, but the crown jewel is my 2000L.

Those laws are in place to protect the wildlife and their spaces for us and future generations that will follow us. If we kill a game out of season, take more than the legal limit, kill specie that is protected, hunt without a proper license - what are we doing? We are stealing from our own family - family of hunters and others who do not hunt. Which religion teaches that we can steal? No religion of earth preaches stealing. Perhaps no one sees you when you poach. Will you sleep well at night whenever you think about that deviant behavior? \n\nWhen I go hunting, I look forward to meeting the game warden in the forest. He is there to enforce the laws that protect our wildlife. When I greet the game warden, I volunteer to show him my rifle, my ammunition and my hunting license. Sensing that I am a law abiding hunter, I hear him saying, " I hope to meet you again." Is this  not a welcome mat? Should we not look forward to another encounter with the one who is there to see that we have hunting opportunity during our next outing? What is the impression I left behind with the game warden? Positive impression. \n\nIf I see someone breaking any hunting laws. I will go out of my way to report such incident to the game warden. I want that person to get maximum penalty that the law allows. I want to see that person in jail - for a long time.\n\nThe minority that do break hunting laws leave bad impression on the society, which includes us - the law abiding hunters. We in the hunting community are victimized - get blamed as a whole for the misdeeds of the few. As good citizens it is our obligation to report the violators.

So there is absolutely no difference between these and the original ones except for the bbs that are used in these guns instead of bullets.\n\nI was unable to find one in Lahore. Even asked guys at pace and they said they can''t import these as these are banned items. So I asked a friend who visits China frequently, and he brought me two of these, a 1911 rep and an HK rep. Both of these cost me about 40k including custom etc (I hope you all know what etc. means in this case hahahahah). The beretta rep that I own is a plastic spring one with ditto weight. I bought is from the Mall. It shoots pretty well and was about 2k when I bought it. It appears that this item has been banned from the market too. But if you can find this heavyweight spring model in the KHI market, I think it can pretty well do the job as well. I have trained with this model and it pretty accurately replicates the weight, ergonomics and the dimensions.

I regret seeing this pic. \n\nBut Gentlemen, there are certain harsh realities with it too. We are living in a country where budget is deficit for decades and we are constantly dependent on foreign aid. Under such circumstances, wild life is not a priority for the government. Secondly again for the same reason that our Government is bhooki, we have discriminatory law. The Arabs come every year, pay our government and have permanent hunting reserves in south Punjab, Sind, and Balochistan. How funny, that a foreginer can come and hunt in our country but the tax payer nationals are deprived of this luxury.\nSame ways, there is a Trophy price for Punjab Urial for foregners where as even here the local even if want to match the price are not allowed the trophy. Till such discriminatory laws are not finished, such cruelty will remain a harsh reality of our Wild life affairs.', ''),

(348565, ' [B]250 Savage[/B]\r\n\r\nDesigned by Charles Newton, the 250 Savage was introduced by the Savage Arms Company as a high-velocity round for the Model 99 lever-action rifle. The original loading used an 87-grain bullet at 3000 fps muzzle velocity, and Savage named it the 250-3000. About 1932, the 100-grain bullet was marketed by the Peters Cartridge Company and later the velocity of 87-grain bullet increased a little, so now it is simply called the 250 Savage. The Savage Model 20 and 40 bolt-action rifles also chambered the round, as did the Winchester Model 54 and 70 bolt actions. A few European rifles have been made in 250 Savage. Late in 1971, Savage announced that their Model 99 would again be available in this caliber, but that''s all changed. Others, such as Ruger and Remington, have made some 250s lately.\r\nFlat trajectory, outstanding accuracy and good killing power on anything up to and including deer are established characteristics of the 250 Savage. It was, and still is, excellent on varmints through deer, but has been edged out by 257 Roberts and the new 6mm cartridges. It has almost always been available in both lever and bolt-action rifles, which has broadened its appeal. It is far superior as a deer cartridge to the 30-30 or anything in that class, regardless of what some 30-30 addicts claim. Its popularity diminished for a time but is on the increase again, and it should remain on the active list for many years.', ''),

(348715, 'Gun Barrels (Discussion #1 on core elements of a weapon) While we always have been discussing and questioning which is better over what and what is worst to which; Wanting to Side_With the best of the weapons that others Think, Use, Wish and Dream,; here I would like my fellow newbees gentlemen to opine why shouldn''t we develop our own insight into weapons in a new way, starting with learning core elements which will place us in category to judge and justice with what we want to side-with:  (Of course, I will have to write from internet so pardon for plagiarism, if any, I commit, unless intellectual brainstorming from all or any of you sparks in me to write something of my own.)\n\n\nLets look what a Gun Barrel has to say to its owner\n\n1.  [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_barrel[/url]\n\n[B]Construction\n[/B]\nModern day gun barrels are sophisticated in their construction and makeup. A gun barrel must be able to hold in the expanding gas produced by the propellants to ensure that optimum muzzle velocity is attained by the bullet or shell as it is being pushed out by the expanding gas(es). Early firearms were mostly muzzle loading (loaded from the mouth rather than the breech), which tends to be a slow and complicated procedure, resulting in a low rate of fire. Breech loading provided a higher rate of fire, but early breech loading guns lacked an effective way of sealing the escaping gases that leaked from the back end of the barrel; resulting in a lower muzzle velocity. During the 19th century, effective mechanical locks were invented that allowed loading from the breech while effectively sealing the breech from escaping propellant gases.\n\n  Smoothbore   = [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothbore[/url]\n  Rifled, A = land diameter, B = groove diameter\n  Polygonal\n\nGun barrels are mostly of metal construction. The early Chinese, the inventors of gunpowder, used bamboo, a naturally tubular wood, as the first barrels in gunpowder projectile weapons. Early European guns were made of wrought iron, usually several bands of the metal arranged around circular wrought iron rings and then welded into a hollow cylinder. The Chinese were the first to master cheap cast-iron cannon barrels. Bronze and brass were favoured by gunsmiths, due to their ease of casting and their ability to resist the corrosion created by the combustion of gunpowder. Early cannons were hugely thick for the caliber that they fired. Early manufacturing defects (such as air bubbles trapped in the metal) were key factors in many gun explosions, when the expanding gases became too much for the weak barrel, causing it to rupture and explode in deadly fragments.\n\n\n[B]A: Rifling [/B]   [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling[/url]\n\nRifling is the process of making helical grooves in the barrel of a gun or firearm, which imparts a spin to a projectile around its long axis. This spin serves to gyroscopically stabilize the projectile, improving its aerodynamic stability and accuracy.\n\nRifling is described by its twist rate, which indicates the distance the bullet must travel to complete one full revolution, such as "1 turn in 10 inches" (1:10 inches), or "1 turn in 25.40 cm" (1:25.4 cm). A shorter distance indicates a "faster" twist, meaning that for a given velocity the projectile will be rotating at a higher spin rate.\n\nThe combination of length, weight and shape of a projectile determines the twist rate needed to stabilize it &#8211; barrels intended for short, large-diameter projectiles like spherical lead balls require a very low twist rate, such as 1 turn in 48 inches (122 cm).[1] Barrels intended for long, small-diameter bullets, such as the ultra-low-drag, 80-grain 0.224 inch bullets (5.2 g, 5.56 mm), use twist rates of 1 turn in 8 inches (20 cm) or faster.[2]\n\nIn some cases, rifling will have twist rates that increase down the length of the barrel, called a gain twist or progressive twist; a twist rate that decreases from breech to muzzle is undesirable, as it cannot reliably stabilize the bullet as it travels down the bore.[3][4] Extremely long projectiles such as flechettes may require impractically high twist rates; these projectiles must be inherently stable, and are often fired from a smoothbore barrel.\n\n\n[B]Recent developments[/B]\n[B]Polygonal rifling[/B]\n\nThe grooves most commonly used in modern rifling have fairly sharp edges. More recently, polygonal rifling, a throwback to the earliest types of rifling, has become popular, especially in handguns. Polygonal barrels tend to have longer service lives because the reduction of the sharp edges of the land reduces erosion of the barrel. Supporters of polygonal rifling also claim higher velocities and greater accuracy. Polygonal rifling is currently seen on pistols from CZ, Heckler & Koch, Glock, Tanfoglio, and Kahr Arms, as well as the Desert Eagle.\n\n\nFor tanks and artillery pieces, the extended range, full bore concept developed by Gerald Bull for the GC-45 howitzer reverses the normal rifling idea by using a shell with small fins that ride in the grooves, as opposed to using a slightly oversized projectile which is forced into the grooves. Such guns have achieved significant increases in muzzle velocity and range. Examples include the South African G5 and the German PzH 2000.\n\nTO BE CONT.....', ''),

Partridges are available for sale at various prices and upto desired number because they have an easy excess to every city.\n\n  People from Multan, khanewal areas are coming with dozens of dogs and beaters in these areas and devastation the boars from the areas. Urials are also migrating to inaccessible mountains and cranes have also shifted towards DIK and thal areas.  River sawan is almost fully cover from gujar khan to dhok pathan and migrated birds also lost their rest areas.\n\n  We all took full advantage of motorway to reach those areas were we never even dreamt. Khushab, mianwali, rangpur were the areas where minimum travel time was 8-10 hours but it cut down to 4-5 hours now. Game is not safe anywhere.\n\n  What befits we can get out of this motorway access for our wildlife????\n\n  This is the question which I want to share with all my associates. \n\nPlease put your suggestions which can promote some positive impacts on game like promoting private game protection areas, some more game reserves like chua saiden shah etc.\n  C.B.U&#8217;s idea has planted a bad impression on hunting because owners are more into illegal hunting and game damages are inexplicable in those CBU&#8217;s. \n\n\n  What idea can be promoted to save wildlife of these beautiful and huge areas?', ''),

The more bullets you can put in the assailant''s body in the same spot, the better chances you have of survival.

(348818, ' I started hunting by myself. I went with my cousin for a very few times in early 90''s in Gujranwala district. But in 2010, I made my first shooting license. Then I got my 12bore license (although I had rifle and pistol license before that). My father gifted me a 12 gauge pump-action (17&#8221; Barrel Length/Viper, Turkey).  Nobody was there to guide me about hunting. I searched Internet and from PakGuns I got some guidelines about hunting places. Then I located the places through GPRS-GPS. I asked several friends of mine to go with me but nobody got ready. Then a person whose name was Afzal and was a badminton player, he got agreed to go along with me. I had heard that, time of waterfowl hunting was early in the morning. My friend afzal and I decided to meet at 4 o&#8217;clock on second Sunday of October 2010. Then we moved for Babukwal near Lahore. We did not know, where to go and how to go. We reached the village at 5.00 a.m. A villager guided us, how to reach riverbank. There we found a hunters&#8217; jeep. We followed that jeep and reached the riverbank. Interesting thing was, that we were riding a Coure car. The way to riverbank was too sandy for the car but we got success to reach the riverbank. The senior hunters&#8217; in the jeep were kind enough. They guided us a lot and tried to facilitate us but we couldn&#8217;t shoot even a single bird. Then the other hunter&#8217;s party left the place before us. Returning back, we got displaced from our way. We had to get help from some villagers and their tractors to pull our car from muddy sands. After so many efforts we reached a metal road and completed our first hunting trip without any bird. But after that visit, I established good relations with those hunters who had met us. Then I visited several good places from Narang Mandi to Har-Choki-Hatar \r\n(near River-Sutluj and Kanganpur) and learned a lot of things. I purchased a repeater of Browning company, a Russian overunder, a BRNO .22 rifle and two pistols. Now I have planned to get a jeep. Now days I am searching for it. So, this the story, how I started hunting.', ''),

If anyone is interested in ordering any of these brand flashlights i can recommend the following two websites. I have ordered from both of them and they offer international shipping. Do a google search on their discount codes as well. \n\n[url]www.goinggear.com[/url]\n[url]www.lighthound.com[/url]\n\nAs far as the comparison to Surefires is concerned, while it is easy to look at the specs and pick the brightest flashlight, you have to realize that Surefire primarily caters to the law enforcement and military where the pricing is alot different. Secondly the quality, modularity and reliability of Surefires is legendary. I have quite a few chinese (including Fenix, Olight, Solarforce etc) and Surefire flashlights and while some of the Chinese flashlights are brighter and even decent quality i can vouch for the Surefire quality being top notch hands down. Run time matters as well, sadly the Surefire incandescent flashlights are showing age and have actually now been discontinued. \n\nI read a comment above regarding better color rendition with the LEDs warm tint and white light. Actually the opposite is true when compared to incandescent flashlights. Color rendition is measured via the CRI (Color rendition index) which stands at 100 for incandescent bulbs and 90 for the best of the warmer LEDs out there. Warmer LEDs will give a better result as compared to cooler ones but that can only be determined when compared side by side. \n\nYou can upgrade almost any Surefire incandescent flashlight to LED or even a high output bulb via OEM and third party dropins. Malkoff, Solarforce, Lumens Factory all make excellent third party dropins to upgrade your Surefires. \n\nRegards', ''),

(348883, ' Where I grew up rabbits are plentiful to say the least and they make a fine and tasty dish if you know your way around the kitchen too.  My first handgun was a .22 Ruger Single-Six which is a classic small game handgun if you invest the time practicing to master the draw/cock/fire sequence required by single action revolvers.  My pal''s hobby was making leather goods so it didn''t take much coaxing to have him craft me a holster that rode low enough to position the butt of my revolver at the perfect level for my quickdraw that also tied around my leg. \n \nI practiced almost every day for a whole summer to where I was not only fast, but accurate from the hip.  For those of you that have done this, you know exactly how many hundreds of hours this takes, don''t you?  Winter soon came, the season was open and time to go gunning for bunnies with my pistol. I soon realized the flaw in my plan was that I had been drawing and firing on stationary targets the whole time.  Yep, the ones that just sat there waiting for my bullets.  Bunnies on the other hand have a pretty good sense of survival and they really run like heck when they take off.  Needless to say I had promised my mom I would bring home dinner and I wasn''t living up to my word.  In fact where I come from they call it "getting skunked".  Week after week my shot placement was always a few feet from my lightning fast furry friends, and then it finally happened.  I spotted one, as I slowly moved in closer he took off like a rocket, I drew and shot in my usual fluid motion, and down it went.  Shot from the hip on a dead run with a single action 22. Good as it gets. Out of the snow, into the game pouch, and strait home to lord my spoils over my mom who by now had become very skeptical of my skills as a gunfighter.  \n \nGunfighter - 1, Rabbit - 0, the way it should be. Or at least that''s what I thought until I got home.  I burst in the house all puffed up with my best "I''ll show you!" smile on and that''s when it was discovered the rabbit only had 3 legs.  At some point in Mr. Rabbit''s career he had lost one of his front legs.  It was all healed over and in his defense it hadn''t hindered his ability to beat a hasty retreat from all his predators, but this fact had completely escaped my mom, who by now was laughing almost to the point of tears that I was gloating about how I had conquered a handicapped bunny. In the end the rabbit had triumphed. Not only in his ability to turn the humiliation tables on yours truely, but he was also the toughest, stringy-est eating son of a gun I''ve eaten in my whole life.', ''),
(348886, ' [QUOTE=arawan;187589]I started hunting by myself. I went with my cousin for a very few times in early 90''s in Gujranwala district. But in 2010, I made my first shooting license. Then I got my 12bore license (although I had rifle and pistol license before that). My father gifted me a 12 gauge pump-action (17” Barrel Length/Viper, Turkey).  Nobody was there to guide me about hunting. I searched Internet and from PakGuns I got some guidelines about hunting places. Then I located the places through GPRS-GPS. I asked several friends of mine to go with me but nobody got ready. Then a person whose name is Afzal and is a badminton player, he got agreed to go along with me. I had heard that, time of waterfowl hunting is early in the morning. My friend afzal and I decided to meet at 4 o’clock on second Sunday of October 2010. Then we moved for Babukwal near Lahore. We did not know, where to go and how to go. We reached the village at 5.00 a.m. A villager guided us, how to reach riverbank. There we found a hunters’ jeep. We followed that jeep and reached the riverbank. Interesting thing was, that we were riding a Coure car. The way to riverbank was too sandy for the car but we got success to reach the riverbank. The senior hunters’ in the jeep were kind enough. They guided us a lot and tried to facilitate us but we couldn’t shoot even a single bird. Then the other hunter’s party left the place before us. Returning back, we got displaced from our way. We had to get help from some villagers and their tractors to pull our car from muddy sands. After so many efforts we reached a metal road and completed our first hunting trip without any bird. But after that visit, I established good relations with those hunters who had met us. Then I visited several good places from Narang Mandi to Har-Choki-Hatar \r\n(near River-Sutluj and Kanganpur) and learned a lot of things. I purchased a repeater of Browning company, a Russian overunder, a BRNO .22 rifle and two pistols. Now I have planned to get a jeep. Now days I am searching for it.

I doubt if any form of Creatine or Protein or Glutamine or any other "non-steroid" supplement can take a person that far!\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\nAmmmm... pounds? lol :)\n\nBrother I had seen enthusiasts younger than me at that point in time doing more weight with Butt Sahib. I don''t know if they were pumping steroids or not but I surely wasn''t. It has a lot to do with genetics too brother and the diet. Supplements were surely there but not steroids.\n\nHow do I remember the exact weights? Cuz I still have my work sheets from back then in my old stash. I started weight training when I was 12 and reached these weights after about 2.5 years of training under Butt Sahib (and by that I mean his tutelage, cuz he wasnt always present while I was pumping iron. He used to assign different tasks to his students at Shapes). Yes I was about 15... into my sixteenth year.\n\nBy the way... the ultra stress technique in supersets requires only 3-4 reps each set. For example, 1 set of smith with 4 reps followed instantly by an inclined bench press set of 3 reps followed instantly by an exercise for back/lats or biceps (depending on days of week). Then a 10 sec break and back to work. Repeating this three times and you''re done with two parts of the body for the day.\n\nWhen pumped like that and trained in this fashion, your muscles become ''addicted'' to ULTRA weights. There is no turning back once you have tasted the ultra stress. But like I said I did face some repercussions later on for training with such stress early in my life.\n\n\n Thank you for your post bro :)', ''),

(348958, '9mm vs... Five Seven Hail VS. Threads :hail:\n\nHere is yet another one:\n\nYou guys must have heard about the FN 5.7x28mm bottlenecked bullets. Here is a little about these beauties from WikiPedia:\n\n[QUOTE]The 5.7x28mm cartridge was created by FN in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7x28mm cartridge weighs 6.0 g (93 grains)&#8212;roughly half as much as a typical 9x19mm cartridge&#8212;making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. The 5.7x28mm produces considerable muzzle blast and muzzle flash, but it produces roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9x19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7x28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.\n\nOne of the design intents of the SS190 variety of this cartridge was that it have the ability to penetrate Kevlar protective vests&#8212;such as the NATO CRISAT vest&#8212;that will stop conventional pistol bullets. Fired from the Five-seven, the 5.7x28mm SS190 is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 100 m (328 ft), and it is capable of penetrating 48 layers of Kevlar material (roughly equivalent to two stacked Level II Kevlar vest panels) at a range of 50 m (164 ft). It is also capable of penetrating a PASGT vest at a range of 300 m (984 ft) or a PASGT helmet at a range of 240 m (787 ft). According to FN, the Five-seven has an effective range of 50 m (165 ft) and a maximum range of 1,510 m (4,950 ft).\n\nIn testing conducted by Passaic County, New Jersey Sheriff''s Department, the SS190 penetrated to a depth of 27 cm (11 in) in bare ballistic gelatin, and a depth of 23 cm (9 in) in gelatin protected with a Kevlar vest.[6] In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7x28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85 in) projectile length[10] to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet''s terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.\n\nThe 5.7x28mm projectile potentially poses less risk of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration and has a reduced risk of ricochet. In the event of a miss, the lightweight projectile also loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (1,310 ft), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9x19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (2,625 ft). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7x28mm cartridge''s intended applications, so the cartridge''s limited range is not conversely considered a disadvantage.[31] Since the 5.7x28mm SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow point, the cartridge and pistol are considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.[/QUOTE]\n\nThe FN FiveSeven (Which is actually the name of the firearm manufactured by the FN and not the bullet, however I use these as synonyms) was recently featured in a Cuba Gooding Jr. Movie called "The Hit List". \n\nSo what do you guys think about the new Five Seven bullet? Should be better than a 9mm for SD scenarios?:biggrin1:', ''),

[B]All trainers i''ve come accross stress a minimum of 8 reps[/B]. I''ll have to do more [B]research on the technique you told and the pros and cons of each[/B]. Thanks for the detailed explanation on ur exercise regieme back then.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n[B]@Doomsday.[/B]..........Min 8 reps and above is ok for the beginning to kind of "open" your body and muscles to take the load of heavier weights later, but sticking to this many reps will not give any significant increase in size/density of the muscles, which are best grown when exposed to heavy loads.\r\n\r\nGenerally, high reps give you muscle [I]definition[/I], low reps the size and greater [I]mass[/I]. Body builders reduce loads and increase reps only prior to competitions, and a different diet and supplementary line of products is usually followed with this.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of greater muscle mass, you should ideally increase the weight load, as soon as you can rep out 6-8 reps comfortably with any given weight, and increase the load so you''re back to 4-6, now use this weight till you again achieve easy 6-8 reps and then load up more weight, and so on.\r\n\r\nMay I add, movement of reps has to be [I]controlled[/I], both in the positive as well as negative phase of the rep, in order to gain maximum. Usually we jerk the weight up and let it fall freely back in the negative phase, and that is the wrong way to go about it. Also, assisting help should be given in a controlled manner, lest you''re building your chest lesser than the helping guy is building his biceps, by "curling" more than you''re "pushing" lolz!\r\n\r\nI remember I used to put just  two fingers to the bar and my mate only had a "psychological" feeling of being helped, and I noted how much the psyche plays tricks with people!\r\n\r\nFinally, as to the tips given by CD bro, that is also o.k, for [I]shocking[/I] the muscles now and then, but you can''t stick to it on a permanent basis, the body responds to shocks, and you have to change from one technique to another, alternating.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(349039, ' Salam All,\nToday, I had the pleasure of finally checking the Beretta/Taurus Compensator.  I took a Taurus PT99 with me to range with Dr. Zakir.  We both had a great day, which towards the end was topped off with cooling rain whilst we were still shooting.  So no photos (didn''t wanna get the Iphone wet!).  The Taurus fired FLAWLESSLY, NOT one jam.  I fired two boxes of POF 2Z and S&B 124Gr. ammo.  Dr. Zakir was using the Chinese stuff if I remember.  This compensator is AMAZING, it doesn''t require the barrel be threaded or anything.  All one does is remove the slide, then the guide rod is replaced with the longer unit and the slide goes back on the frame.  The comp. slides into place and is locked into place via a small nut in the front.  How was the recoil... literally none existent!!  We did have a slight problem with the Taurus in that when shooting plates the front sight of the PT99 is NOT black like the rear sight, so we were trying to guesstimate the aiming against the plates at 25meters (27yards).  Over all the gun was a blast to shoot.  I also took my commander out of its cobwebs and gave it a twirl as I hadn''t fired it for over a year.  Both fired WITHOUT jams.  Here are the photos, the rest I will leave for Dr. Zakir to comment on.

That way I was told aerobic effect wd be maximized.\r\n\r\nAny more ideas??? Perhaps adding some resistance training to it?? In what sequence & type of exercise??', ''),

(349084, ' The awesome Winchester Model 52 was the undisputed champ for most of a century in my book. I shot for the ROTC rifle team back in college and while most of my team members couldn''t wait to pair up with the newer Anschutz models, I preferred the 52.  You can still find them in nice shape but the nostalgia factor has really upped the price bad.  I''m an old school guy, I really love the indisputed classics, but from a technical stand point also I have to appreciate my 2000L may well be a better platform at a fraction of the cost.  No matter what, the custom made guns rule the competition today and tomorrow too.  The stakes are so high these days no one stands a chance with a gun bought off the rack.  Thankfully I don''t have to hold myself to the highest standards requiered to win national championships and can relax and enjoy the spoils of their conquests.\n \nThe 572 is intriguing to me.  Haven''t shot one but it''s nice to see them doing what I think Ruger has failed to do all along, which is up the ante on an off-the-shelf platform.  To me, Ruger 10/22''s have failed to offer significant improvements to their platform by relying to the after-market to correct their design and manufacturing flaws and it needs to come back and bite them.\n \nMy photo skills stink almost as bad as my shooting, but if there is some hardware I have you would like to see sir, I will post it for you as best as I can.', ''),

It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American  birds. It is also the leading gamebird, with up to 70 million birds shot  annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to  sustain its population under such pressure stems from its prolific  breeding: in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six [URL="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"]broods[/URL] a year.Mourning Doves are prolific breeders. In warmer areas, these birds may raise up to six broods in a season.  This fast breeding is essential because mortality is high. Each year,  mortality can reach 58% a year for adults and 69% for the young.\n The Mourning Dove is monogamous and forms strong pair bonds.  Pairs typically reconvene in the same area the following breeding  season, and sometimes may remain together throughout the winter.  However, lone doves will find new partners if necessary.(wikipedia)[/COLOR]\n\n\n[B]Breeding season[/B]\n    February through October   \n\n[COLOR=purple]Collared Doves are now such common visitors to the garden, imagining  that this bird did not live in Britain before the early 1950s is       difficult. One reason for this is their long breeding season:  March to       October.[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=dimgray]Though they lay eggs throughout the year, Laughing Doves main breeding season is from September to October or November, and from March to April. [/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=seagreen]On the average, a mourning dove                  will raise 3 broods during the breeding season which runs from                  March - September. Doves will generally return to the same areas                  they were hatched year after year. [/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=darkorange]Young doves stay with or near their parents for at least a week after  leaving the nest.  After that, they are pretty much on their own,  although they may well stay around the territory they''ve come to know at  least until next spring when the nesting season begins again and they  must find their own territory.  The parent birds frequently go on to  raise more broods after the first one is fledged.  Mourning Doves, for  example, have been known to raise as many as five broods of babies in  one season.  Maybe that''s why there are always plenty of Mourning Doves  around![/COLOR]\n\n\n[SIZE=5][COLOR=yellowgreen]The breeding season is very long; in the middle states it lasts from May to August and rarely to early September. The birds commonly rear two broods in a season, and Miss A. R. Sherman believes that they probably rear three sometimes. In her notes Miss Sherman says in substance: \n[I]The doves are so numerous and so secretive in their ways that it is not possible to say whether a pair of birds, which has nested in May or June, breed again late in June or July. When a nest is used twice in the same season, however, the assumption is that a pair of birds is using their own nest a second time.[/I][/COLOR][/SIZE][COLOR=yellowgreen] [/COLOR]\n\n\n[B]Fall and Winter[/B].--In regions where mourning doves are common, they begin to resume their gregarious habits soon after the breeding season is over. \n\n[FONT=Century Gothic][SIZE=5][COLOR=deepskyblue]Mourning doves have the longest breeding season of all North American  birds.

They nested for the entire month , grw up the new ones and now all are out of nest, thus raising the population considerably.They might be breeding again ,,,but as I pointed out earlier ,,,there is no fun of prevention ,,,if it has to last the entire year.I just know that life,s getting difficult with each passing day for the hunter....very few can indulge in the pleasure of real hunt like antelopes or patridges and quails etc because of wild life deptt regulations...well if someone wants to ban the last bit of pleasure available,,,,by superfluous considerations,,, go on', ''),

(349332, 'Common Sense Guidelines &quot;PROTECTING HUNTERS FROM THE RISK&quot; @All friends; I think safety precautions being hunters can minimize to the expecting risks with game.\n\n&#8226;	Avoid hunting if you are feeling ill. People are more prone to disease if their immune systems are weakened by other illnesses or conditions.\n\n&#8226;	Take precautions to minimize insect bites.\n\n&#8226;	Do not handle or eat wild game or fowl that appeared ill or were acting in an abnormal manner before they were killed.\n\n&#8226;	Do not eat, drink or smoke while cleaning wild fowl or game.\n\n&#8226;	Always protect your hands with gloves (heavy rubber, latex) when field dressing wild game or fowl. Do not use the same utensils to clean different species.\n\n&#8226;	Minimize contact with brain or spinal tissues. When boning out the carcass, keep both the head and spine intact. Do not cut into the head of any antlered animal when removing antlers from an animal, use a handsaw and always wear safety glasses.\n\n&#8226;	Avoid abdominal shots because they lead to contamination of the meat and can cause the animal needless suffering. \nIf any intestinal contents of the game come into contact with meat, the meat should be considered contaminated and should be cut off and discarded. \nDo not feed the contaminated meat to other animals, or they may become infected.\n\n&#8226;	Large game should be shot with a clean, humane kill shot, preferably avoiding the abdomen, followed quickly by removal of the intestines; this minimizes the risk of intestinal contents contaminating the meat.\n\n&#8226;	If any of the intestines have an abnormal smell or discharge, or if pockets of blood are seen in the muscle unassociated with the bullet/shot wound, the flesh should be considered unfit for eating.\n\n&#8226;	The abdominal cavity should be cleaned, dried and cooled until the meat is processed. During warm weather (over 65° F, or 18.3 C), bags of ice should be placed in the body cavity to hasten cooling. The carcass should be protected against flies.\n\n&#8226;	Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer immediately after handling wild game or fowl, including the tissues and meat.\n\n&#8226;	Wash tools, equipment and working surfaces thoroughly with soap and water, followed by disinfections immediately after handling any wild game or fowl. \nAdding a minimum of 1 tablespoon of bleach to 1 gallon of water is usually adequate for use as a cleaning/disinfecting solution.\n\n&#8226;	While prepare your own ground meat, thoroughly clean and disinfect all equipment after use.\n\n&#8226;	Avoid eating raw or undercooked meat. Always cook wild meat until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink in color (generally 150-180°F [65.6 &#8211; 82.2 C], depending on the type of meat). \nThis will reduce the risk of food-borne disease. Because the color of the meat is not always a reliable indicator of proper cooking. \n\n&#8226;	Cook wild birds thoroughly - any cooked bird should reach an internal temperature of 165°F (73.9 C) or higher to make sure that organisms and parasites are killed and are no longer infective.\n\n&#8226;	Any uncooked game should be promptly frozen, refrigerated or disposed of properly. Keep uncooked wild game separate from cooked or ready-to-eat foods to avoid contamination.\n\n&#8226;	Meat should be properly wrapped and stored on bottom shelves of the refrigerator or freezer to avoid blood dripping on (and potentially contaminating) other foods.\n\n&#8226;	Meat should be refrigerated or frozen properly and should not be kept at room temperature. Freezing meat does not necessarily protect against disease.\n\n&#8226;	Make sure hunting dogs are up-to-date on their vaccines, especially rabies, prior to hunting season.\n__________________________________________________________________', ''),

Comparing fiveseven to 9mill, in my opinion, only serves to highlight the supremacy of the later on the former, especially in CQC. \n\nIts availability is an issue no doubt.

The "ectomorphic" built, hence longer muscles and body organs, extremely low BMI factor, does best with the heavier sets, low reps, fewer exercises, and high intake of carbs and protein, whereas the endomorphic, mesophorphic types pack on size, muscles easier and can do with less of carbs, and usually require a relatively higher number of exercises, reps and sets.

I agree to the points you have made. Comparing it with TT would be better suited. However, I was comparing it to 9mill cuz of the reasons already mentioned in answering brother denovo''s post.\n\nOver penetration could be useful in certain scenarios. For example in firing from behind the walls/covers etc. Also, I am particularly interested in the bullet''s flat trajectory. The bullet is cited as one of the most ''on-target'' projectiles around. That gives an extra edge in SD CQC scenarios. And then there is no fear of a ricochet and the bullet loses its potency after only 400 meters. All these things interest me and I think it would be a good alternative to 9mills in near future when the gun and the bullets become easily available in PK market. Hopefully :) \n\nOn a side note... also taking into account Dr. sahib''s precise post, I dont think practice can exist without the theoretical. Vice versa of the said, however, is not impossible. And the idea of ''practicality'' is pretty subjective in nature too. I know gun enthusiasts who own more than 16 guns... for what? Simply cuz its their passion. In a realistic world, would you call that ''practical''? Would you call any passion by those standards ''practical''? I mean I am a salaried middle-class person and I am a gun enthusiast but I own only one gun, which is for all purposes (target practice, HD, SD etc). Thats practical to me. On the other hand, you may deem people with 15 guns practical too and cite their passion as the justifying point. \n\nOne of the biggest factors in CQC is the psyche and how different people feel more secure with different kinds of ammo/guns etc. There have been studies over the ''life style'' of different gun model lovers. Built, clothing, day to day routine, subconscious fears... there is a lot that can be reflected through your choice of guns and ammo. Discussing different calibers in comparison to each other add to my knowledge in this regard and that is primarily why I am interested in these kinds of ''theoretical'' studies. I hope some one else shares this ''passion'' too ;)\n\nThank you for your input bhai. Greatly appreciated. :)', ''),

We both had a great day, which towards the end was topped off with cooling rain whilst we were still shooting.  So no photos (didn''t wanna get the Iphone wet!).  The Taurus fired FLAWLESSLY, NOT one jam.  I fired two boxes of POF 2Z and S&B 124Gr. ammo.  Dr. Zakir was using the Chinese stuff if I remember.  This compensator is AMAZING, it doesn''t require the barrel be threaded or anything.  All one does is remove the slide, then the guide rod is replaced with the longer unit and the slide goes back on the frame.  The comp. slides into place and is locked into place via a small nut in the front.  How was the recoil... literally none existent!!  We did have a slight problem with the Taurus in that when shooting plates the front sight of the PT99 is NOT black like the rear sight, so we were trying to guesstimate the aiming against the plates at 25meters (27yards).  Over all the gun was a blast to shoot.  I also took my commander out of its cobwebs and gave it a twirl as I hadn''t fired it for over a year.  Both fired WITHOUT jams.

I was carrying rifle and shotguns were with friends. \n\nWe planned to avail all available sports arms on herd; friends left me at paralleled height on opposite hill with rifle. They set time 15 minutes for shot after their departure to behind ''Urials Hill''.\nDuring these 15 minutes I was crawling to set perfect range; I was very well camouflage and wind direction was favorable for my shot, "Urials" were grazing without any sign of danger around their hill. Means everything was fine.\n\nI set my rifle at big one  within 7-8 minutes after departure of my friends and distance was around 90 -100 meter, I didn&#8217;t wait for my friends according to our shooting plan and I took shooting decision. \nBut my decision was very bad non technical and immature. \nBecause, I choose time to shoot when saw 02 big animals are standing with their cross heads towards me, and I thought what a great chance,  ''if I will fire on the neck of the animal at the front than the bullet will cross from neck for the next target, and I will hunt 02 animals with one bullet before my friends. \n\nBut at that time I didn&#8217;t not considered that I am taking shot with soft nose 140 grains of 7X57 bullet, its not a military bullet.\nWhen I took that shot animal at the front moved neck down and bullet crossed near to the lower portion of the second animal. \nAnd I missed both due to my bad shot with a non hunting wish at very close distance. After shot boom my friends appeared from the left  & right slopes of the hill with angry faces.\n\nBecause, I too that shot, 05-minutes before mutually settled time and meanwhile they were climbing up.

(349539, ' [B]@Zeeshan Malik..[/B].........First of all, Drag80 bro''s issue was mainly his office and car parked all day in open, uncovered area. Hence, those suggestions of mine above.\n\nNow, for the general carry in the car, let me put my genuine impression, that our main problem in Pakistan is summer specific and our national dress!!\n\nHadn''t it been due to the these limitations, I''ve always stated, best carry method, fastest draw, is undoubtedly the [COLOR="blue"]horizontal[/COLOR] shoulder carry, from which cross draw is possible quickly, effectively, no matter whatsoever position one is in,[I] sitting[/I], [I]standing[/I], [I][COLOR="blue"]driving[/COLOR][/I], [I]lying down[/I]!!!\n\nUnfortunately, our weather does only facilitate us this option during winters, covering the gun with some form of winter clothing, jacket, coat, waistcoat, etc. That''s my suggestion for the winter, even when driving the car.\n\nAs for the summer, where you can''t conceal your weapon with any clothing, the issues begin, especially when driving a vehicle, where a hip holster, whether IWB or OWB, whatsoever, is really too cumbersome to draw from, even in standing position, leave alone the sitting one, especially if wearing traditional national dress!!\n\nDashboards, etc, are only o.k for concealing the gun, not for an SOS draw. I personally just put it between the gear and the rear console, but it''s dangerous, if you park your car momentarily, without locking.\n\nI''ve seriously been contemplating screwing up the console to the right and just beneath of the steering wheel, by having a Fobus type holster fitted there,[I] by any technical means[/I], since that''s a position from where the gun can easily be drawn, while being reasonably concealed as well, and the Fobus secures that unwarranted hands cannot draw the gun easily, just like that, if out for a moment. But then again, it''s still a "PROJECT" only, lolz!\n\nThe door side is dangerous, since the gun can drop out, easily.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

The console between the front two seats (AK bro I guess we have the same car model so u will understand better what am talking about), is comparatively better place. Its easy to access and more importantly, it gets less heated up due to sunlight.\r\n\r\nTill a few days ago, I used to carry it to my office in my bag but one day one of my collegues saw it and his jaw nearly hit the ground ''''what the hell is that''''. lol. That day i realized that guns are normal things for gun enthusiasts like us but for other people, carrying guns like this is not a normal thing. \r\n\r\nAnyways, so the conclusion is that if car is parked directly under sun in summers, the temprature inside the car poses no threat and the bullets wont malfunction.\r\n\r\nThats quite a relief. :-)', ''),

(349656, ' [QUOTE=AK47;188207]You''re welcome! Let me just add, I always found the 6-8 as the best, only occasionally switching over to 4-6, to shock the muscles, now or then, with a couple of heavy sets.\r\n\r\nAlso, let me say, it again depends on your built and purpose, if you already are well massed, and only need some "definition", you may do better with high reps, like 10-12, and even more, occasionally. What''s your BMI factor, height, weight? \r\n\r\nAlso correct dietary intake is as important as the exercise itself. The "ectomorphic" built, hence longer muscles and body organs, extremely low BMI factor, does best with the heavier sets, low reps, fewer exercises, and high intake of carbs and protein, whereas the endomorphic, mesophorphic types pack on size, muscles easier and can do with less of carbs, and usually require a relatively higher number of exercises, reps and sets. The mesomorphic type is just the most ideal, natural figure to have for body-building purposes.\r\n[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nI would say that my body is more towards Endomorph than Mesomorph. My current BMI is 24.9, and that too after losing 9kgs. I have to be very careful with my diet because I tend to gain weight around the tummy area easily. My height is 5''8" or 9" and current weight is around 74.5 kgs (reduced from 83.5kgs). \r\n\r\nIt is due to my build that i have to include atleast 30 mins of cardio and abs exercises in my workout regime. I do a minimum of 8 reps and a maximum of 12 with any given weight. But now I think the time has come to start experimenting with significantly heavier weights and lesser reps like you mentioned. \r\n\r\n(B.T.W, I can benchpress a max of 30kgs (each side, bar weight excluded), and I''m finding it a bit difficult to increase it. One reason is that uptil now, i was aiming for a minimum of 8 reps for any weight, which is difficult to achieve if you increase the weight.)', ''),

Coz semi auto have lot of moving parts and even best semi auto can jam or misfire and no one can deny this fact. This doubt always shakes my confidence coz in SD situation u wont get a second chance. If a person aims at a BG and fires and his weapon jams, the BG wont give him another second to live. \n\nAlthough chance of jam/misfire is low but still there is a chance and atleast I dont take chances with my life. so now am seriously thinking to start carrying my 357 mag for SD.\n\n@ Fasji Bro, I dont know where u live may be its a village or farm and I agree that at such places u need automatic weapons but in cities and congested areas where most of us live, u may not require more than 4-5 rounds. and believe me in situations which u have described above, even a semi auto weapon is not enough. U need a swat team for ur defense.\n\nWhen I hear suspicious sound in my house at night, I carry my pt 92 in holster as backup weapon and my 357 mag as primary weapon in my hand.

(349955, 'Extreme Temperatures and Firearms The other day it was too Hot.I was thinking if the temperature of the gun and ammunition were 10 below zero or what are some problems that would occur at 100 degrees or more, like humidity etc.\r\nAny idea what would happen if you tried to fire a frozen firearm?\r\nSo did little research and here is what i dig from the Net.Your comments will be helpful.\r\n\r\nIn extreme cold conditions moisture accumulated within the action can cause the bolt to freeze shut and may operation of the weapon imposible.\r\nA common problem is the sluggishness of the operation of the weapons in extreme cold. Normal lubricants thicken in low temperature and stoppage or sluggish action of firearms results. During the winter, weapons must be stripped completely and cleaned with a drycleaning solvent to remove all lubricants and rust prevention compounds.\r\nAnother problem in the areas of severe cold is a higher rate of breakage and malfunctions. These can also be attributed primarily to the cold, although snow in a weapon may cause stoppage and malfunctions. The tempered metal of automatic weapons, for example, will cool to a point where it cannot be touched by human flesh. This extreme cold makes the metal brittle. When the weapon is fired at subzero temperatures, the temperature of the barrel and gun will rapidly rise to between 200° and 750°, depending upon the number of rounds fired. This again reduces the temper and, because the parts are working, breakages will occur early in the firing while the weapon is warming up. Many malfunctions also occur during this period due to the presence of ice or snow in the weapon or freezing of working parts. The weapons should first be fired at a slow rate of fire. Once the parts have warmed up, the rate of fire may be increased to the cyclic rate. One of the main problems is to insure that snow and ice do not get into the working parts, sights, or barrel. The weapon must be carefully handled during movement through the snow-covered woods, and especially under combat conditions in deep snow.\r\n\r\nHeat on the other hand doesn''t affect the firearms so much, unless there''s a bedding problem.\r\nAs for extremely high temperatures, the heat can cause various parts of the gun to expand and warp, leading to potential jamming, and accuracy problems. The humidity would not have a significant effect on the weapon, other than causing rust and corrosion to form over time if it is not cleaned.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, propellants vary in energy output with temperature. That''s why the classic British cartridges of the golden age of the African safari are so voluminous and low-pressure. The heat of Africa could raise pressures to unsafe levels in smaller cases. Hodgdon has done a fine job of designing propellants that are less temperature sensitive, but they can''t be made completely impervious to temperature.', ''),

[B]If its changed everything goes perfect all we need is to turn our hunting towards enjoyment instead meat collecting.[/B][/QUOTE]\n Not to bring religion in but I would like to add some points after reading this. Hunting in Islam is only permissible if it is for meat collection, as far as my knowledge says.\nHunting really implies taking a life of a living being. Taking a life of a living being (other than humans) is allowed in Islam, if the purpose is to eat the animal. According to Islam, this permission is granted under the strict condition that God be remembered while taking such life - reminding ourselves that:\n\n   1.      God alone is the source of all the blessings that we enjoy in life and therefore God alone needs to be thanked for all these blessings of in life;\n   2.      the animal is being killed with the express permission of God; and\n   3.      God - the sole source of life for all living things - is the only true authority that can grant permission for taking life.\n\nThe permission of taking life of another living being, however, is restricted to using the meat of the animal for eating or for using its parts in things that are generally beneficial for man or for saving oneself from the loss that the animal may entail for man.\n\nContrary to the above explanation, hunting, as a sport, implies killing another living being for our pleasure. I really do not think that the pain, torture and death of another living being could be a source of pleasure for any human being, let alone a true, God-fearing, Muslim. Hunting as a sport is an inhumane act. Islam does not approve any act, which is brutal and merciless in its nature.\n\nThe Merciful would indeed expect us to show some mercy on creatures upon which we have some power. After all, what would be our refuge, if God started hunting us, as His sport?\n\nConclusion: I would say that instead of pleasure/enjoyment, hunting should only be done for obvious reasons like- If you kill something that hurts you or your things, for food ( especially if something is good to taste and healthy).\n\nHunting was only done in past centuries, I think , as the main source of food for humans was hunting. So hunting should be done only for meat collection IMHO.', ''),

These are preferred for home defence as there are no safeties to fumble with and no empty chambers and slides to rake etc. \nBy the way the click on an empty chamber is the loudest experience if one lives to remember, so Revolvers are still prefrred for HD and by ladies who are scared of breaking nails on the slide and loading of magazines is a problem for most.\nHow ever a .357 when shot in the confines of a room will be an experience by itself.\nA lady shot two dacoits dead in Karachi about 8 years back while her husband pretended to be fast asleep, she used her husbands .357 and had never fired a hand gun before.\nRevolvers tend to be bigger and heavier and if one is large then it is alright but for a small frame man these are harder to conceal, yet air weight revolvers by S&W are very light and small and can easily be carried all  day and concealed easily.\nSD\nI how ever maintain, for SD a revolver should be at least a .38 special.\nIf small barrelled Revolvers is preferred then never go for a .357, stick to a .38 special. A .357 is only usefull when 4 inch barrelled as in case of shorter barrels there will be a terrible blast, recoil and a fire ball ruining your night vision at night', ''),

(350094, 'Review: P07 DUTY (600+ Rounds - Zero Malfunctions!) Asalamoalaikum everyone! \n\nRecently I was looking for a compact, practical and DEAD accurate 9mm handgun which I could carry everyday with an IWB holster. Purpose was to get the handgun solely for Self-Defence. Started looking for one and well, CZ answered the call! More precisely, DUTY answered the call for DUTY! :D \n\n[size=+2][b]Initial Impression; [/b][/size]\n\nThe first time I ever held the DUTY, I knew instantly that this would answer the call to my requirements. It was very light weight with an amazing grip angle, the grips themselves are a bit aggressive but that''s because it doesn''t come with the option to change the grip so it fit perfectly. The sights are standard nonadjustable and they give a ''Glock'' like impression to the user. Trigger comes with the CZ''s new ''Omega Trigger System'' and breaks clean and crisp. Quite impressive! For a polymer, slim-profile 9mm, the gun holds 16 rounds of 9x19. Also comes with a picatinny rail system for mounting light/laser. \n\nHere''s a video of my first impression of the gun; \n\n[video=youtube;6Xtmg5zG7Vg]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xtmg5zG7Vg&feature=relmfu[/video]\n\n[size=+2][b]Range Report; [/b][/size]\n\n[img]http://i55.tinypic.com/30w36s4.jpg[/img]\n\nThe DUTY''s been through 200+ rounds so far and it pretty much ate up everything I fed it. So far I''ve tried this ammo manufacturers through the duty; \n\n[b]1. Sellier&Bellot \n2. Armscor Precision 124 Grain JHP\n3. Chinese red box (311 designation)\n4. Chinese blue box (2009 Designation)\n5. Russian WOLF ( Gold Projectile - Gray Shell)\n6. Russian Barnaul [/b]\n\nAll of them worked perfectly with the DUTY. \n\nFrom a distance of 15 meters, I''ve been able to get these results; \n\n[b]5 rounds; [/b]\n\n[img]http://i51.tinypic.com/14njqyb.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]20 rounds (Same target); [/b]\n\n[img]http://i54.tinypic.com/2ln876.jpg[/img] \n\nIs that beautiful or what? :D 10 rounds = 1 gigantic crater. \n\nConclusion as far as range is concerned, well, targets speak for themselves. For a compact pistol with a 3.7 inch barrel, this pistol goes beyond the call of DUTY (Cheesy, I know :P) I was expecting a lot of recoil from this weapon but frankly, you barely feel it (If you grip it right) and it''s quite manageable! \n\n[size=+2][b]Practical Shooting - Self-Defence Scenario/Draw from Concealment [/b][/size]\n\nI decided to test this weapon from a carry point of view as well. 3 threats were at 7 7/12 meters away and only 6 rounds were in the magazine. I was carrying the weapon concealed and on Starfish''s signal, the shooting began! Took a little less than 5 seconds to down three targets. Results? Please watch this video; \n\n[video=youtube;_uBVYSL77fU]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uBVYSL77fU[/video]\n\n[b]124 Grain Armscor Precision Hollow Point Test[/b]\n\n\n[B]Test # 1 - 8 rounds [/B]\n\n[video=youtube;inbM-dkWduk]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inbM-dkWduk[/video]\n\n[B]Test # 2 - 6 rounds[/B]\n\n[video=youtube;mYcbyaqA31I]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYcbyaqA31I[/video]\n\n\nIf I''d have to score this weapon based on MY OPINION, I''d go something like this; \n\n[b]POU (Point of use) - DUTY/SelfDefense/CCW\n\nAccuracy - 9/10 \nConcealment - 8/10\nTrigger - 10/10\nReliability - 10/10\nAmmo Capacity - 10/10 (Based on one mag of 9x19 - 16 rounds)\nGrips/Grip Angle - 10/10\n\nGood enough for self defense? 10/10![/b]\n\nOverall, I''ve found the weapon I was looking for so long! The P07 DUTY Delivers so far and I''m hoping that it''ll keep on delivering the goods for many years to come. It''s a must have if you''re looking for a primary SELF-DEFENSE weapon. It''s accurate, it''s deadly, it''s compact but packs a BIG PUNCH! Probably the reason why they named it DUTY, right? :P \n\nI hope this review was a bit helpful to all the new users who''re considering to buy this handgun. At the end of the day, my opinion is; GET ''EM WHILE THEY''RE HOT! :D \n\nI wish you all a good and safe day! :)\n\nP.S Some eye candy from my range session 2 weeks back; \n\n[img]http://i51.tinypic.com/2hy7zgl.jpg[/img]', ''),

Otherwise its not possible to get same penetration from the two calibers. \r\n\r\nAn increase of 400 ft/sec muzzle velocity of a bullet may seem ordinary to us but in fact it makes a huge difference. Just like u need 1 horse power to get a car from 0 to 20 mph but u need 50 horse power to get it from 200 to 220 mph. Hence, even a slight increase in top end velocity means huge difference in power.\r\n\r\nA 9mm 158 grain bullet has muzzle velocity of around 290 m/s and energy approx 430 Joule. On the other hand, 357 mag 158 grain bullet has muzzle velocity of around 490 m/s and energy approx 1,250 Joule, making it far more powerful than 9mm.\r\n\r\n357 mag has proven its self all around the world and rated as ''''the most effective handgun caliber'''' by law enforcement agencies in United states. Search on the net and u will get ur answer.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I dont like about my revolver(608 6.5 inch) is the weight and size. At first I thought that its Taurus that makes heavy guns but then I checked the specifications of Smith n Wesson 357 mag with 6.5 inch and it has almost the same weight with difference of only 2 ounces.

(350170, ' AoA Everybody\r\n\r\nAfter owning (and using) a Baikal MP446 Viking and a CZ 999 Scorpion, my vote goes to the Scorpion. in my humble opinion, it is more of a "complete package" type handgun. it might not be as durable as a Viking (just a subjective/popular view, no concrete evidence of one being more durable over the other exists) but it offers some other qualities that are absolutely absent in Baikal MP446 Viking. To me, a firearm is just like another tool/toy/equipment. it should offer durability as well as comfort and luxury to the owner/operator. thats just my opinion, your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nSecond is the availability of parts in case you break something. I know, the probability of breaking something in these two handguns is quiet small but nonetheless, it can happen as the famous Murphy''s law states [B]IF ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG, IT WILL[/B]. with CZ 999 Scorpion, you can almost certainly find replacements online in the shape of SIG P226 parts (springs, guide rods). you can also use local made sig parts (clone SIGs). they may not be as long lasting as original Sig parts but they will get your gun working ASAP. Some of the parts that are not "drop-in type" can be easily modified from SIG P226 parts either original or clone.\r\n\r\nThen there is the magazine issue, beretta/sig mags can be easily converted into CZ 999 Scorpion mags by any competent gunsmith in a matter of minutes. since the local market is practically floods with beretta mags (clone and original), the cost of such a converted mag is unbelievably small. whereas with a Baikal: [B]good luck finding extra mags[/B].\r\n\r\nThere u go, I have expressed my opinion on the subject. This is just my opinion based on what I like and do not like in a handgun. your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(350173, ' and as for the popular view of a Baikal MP446 Viking being more durable than a CZ 999 Scorpion, Here are my findings about the CZ 999 Scorpion:\r\n\r\nA design that has seen war/conflict. the hardest/harshest of any test. undergone changes afterwards. stating that the product matured or incorporated the lessons learned. whereas Baikal Viking has seen no such thing.\r\n\r\nThe cold hammer forged barrel of the CZ 999 Scorpion is thicker than Baikal MP446 Viking. after measuring both with a vernier caliper, I welcome anybody to reject my statement. another plus, it is chromed lined from inside and outside. some say it is a sign of durability, I''ll say not necessarily. but I would rather have inside and outside chroming instead of only inside chroming.\r\n\r\nThe rifling on CZ 999 Scorpion is distinct and deep than on Viking. I do not know what that means but I would rather have deep and distinct rifling. kinda gives an impression to me that such a barrel would have longer life. but thats only my guestimation. your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nnow coming to controls, Baikal''s trigger is the best in its class not doubt about it. but thats not the end of it. there are other controls too, CZ 999 is supplied with an ambidextrous decocker, ambidextrous slide release and ambidextrous magazine release. this is a big time plus in my opinion. whereas baikal''s controls in my opinion are less than impressive.\r\n\r\nNow, the way I see it. I have yet to find a single point/argument where a Baikal Viking would exceed a CZ999 Scorpion in terms of durability.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

By definition any shot gun which can fire more than one shells successively is a repeater, so DBBL, believe or not it is a type of repeater.

I found the most economical means of travel is perhaps your own vehicle, even on Petrol, if you''re 2-4 passengers, and apart from a couple of places with breakages of the road, well, the general route was pretty good and acceptable to any modern day car.You''ll need a car with you, since distances locally from one spot to another are huge and local rentals expensive.\r\n\r\nNow, a few snap-shots:\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="4"]An outlook from PTDC motel[/SIZE][/COLOR]:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Picture010.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="4"]An outlook from Eagle''s Nest[/SIZE][/COLOR]:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Picture038Medium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="4"]Karimabad Morning (Eagle''s Nest)[/SIZE][/COLOR]:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Picture055_editedMedium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="4"]Hunza Fort[/SIZE][/COLOR]:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Picture023Medium.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="red"][SIZE="4"]A Local type of Cows[/SIZE][/COLOR]:\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1136.photobucket.com/albums/n497/wahstar1/Picture015.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA night''s lodging in Karimabad was for around Rs. 1500 at PTDC Motel, that is 3 years back. May stand at some Rs. 2000-2500 today. General cost of food is kind of "national", around Rs. 200-400 pr. person/pr.time, coz guests are few there and they charge accordingly to meet the expenses.\r\n\r\nA night''s lodging at Eagle''s Nest Motel may be for around Rs. 4000 today, for a room with 2 beds.\r\n\r\nNatco one-way tickets were for around Rs. 850 per passenger in those days, and may stand at some Rs. 1200-1500 today, and a one-way PIA fair from Gilgit to ISB stood at some Rs. 2500 per passenger in those days, may stand at some Rs. 4500 today.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the thread is to portray and [I]expose[/I] the scenic beauty of our beloved country, and share the travel experiences, with respect to travel costs, lodgings, food, general expenditures, tips, routes, etc, and any general info, as to help and assist practically, any other of our aspiring members. So kindly share and make posts that stay within this purpose.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

John Pondoro Taylor has published his research which is known as John Pondoro Taylors Knock Out Tables.\nJP Taylor wrote this about 40 years back after about as many years experience in Africa .\nThe terminal ballistics and the wounding effect of bullets is a very vast and complex subject.\nIf we take two FMJ bullets like 9mm and a .45 the wounding effect of the 45 is likely to be more effective the 9mm wil be impacting at about 1200 fps while the 45 will be impacting at close to 800 ft per sec.\nWhen we take the same two calibers and fire identical Hydra shox or any other expanding bullets we will find the 9mm will create a a much larger wound channel and will be more effective due to the expansion of the 9mm bullet to at least 1.5 times its caliber due to its high velocity, where as the 45 bullet due to its very low velocity may not expand as much.\nThis is still controversial and not conclusive, I am basing my opinion on the research work carried out already at great length by the W.P White laboratory and other ordnance departments of US army and police and can be accessed easily on the net.\nDiscussing this subject helps us all in understanding this very complex subject.\nWhen we shoot big game like buffaloe a very high velocity ordinary soft point bullet simply breaks up on penetrating a few inches and hitting any of the massive bones; where as the premium expanding bullets which expand to a controlled degree without weight loss and fragmentation create a large wound channel and yet penetrate deeply.\nTalking of military bullets the 5.56 fragmentates( even though FMJ) at high impact velocities . These fragments act as secondary missiles inside the very soft human body; when a human target is shot at under 200 yards from a 20 inch barrel rifle but when the shorter barrelled carbines(12 to 14 inches) are used the bullet fragmentates at ranges of under a 100yards ( please see the site quoting the research work; I am quoting from there ). \nThe 7.62 bullets usually do not fragmentate but they achieve greater destructive power by tumbling.\nAs AK47 correctly said it is caliber, weight ,velocity and construction or type of bullet which will determin the terminal effects. Nothing beats SHOT PLACEMENT.\nPlease look up John Pondoro Taylors Knock Out Tables on the net and also Terminal Ballistics;  we will realise we are tying to re-invent the wheel.', ''),

The road up to Hunza is undergoing major repairs and is largely torn up these days. Do not come up in a normal car! If you''re driving from Islamabad, you can break your journey at the PTDC in Besham and give the kids a break. If you fly up, its not a big deal to arrange transport to Hunza and the other nearby spots.\n\nA few of my photographs at this link, my bandwidth here is too limited to upload directly.

Bro 12Gauge is right in pointing that out that barrel length is immaterial in that sense. But as far as exact weight of this gun model with barrel length of 29.5" to be exact (i.e. of Sporting ver of Baikal over & under MP27) is concerned, it is listed to be 7.9 lbs .... now that weight is one&#8217;s personal  preference. It is better to handle the gun and then compare its handling with MP-27M model in both 26&#8221; and 28&#8221; barrels (my guess would be 26&#8221; barrel would be about 7.25 lbs and 28&#8221; barrel about 7.6 lbs). However, the wider rib and the nickel finish is a plus certainly as I have extensively used a wider rib Beretta A303 (Sporting ver) with twin beads, and seen it work like magic at upland and even at skeet. So the weight and its balance (called &#8216;shotgun handling&#8217;) should be personally checked as in my opinion it is an individual choice. \r\n\r\nBaikal O/U 26&#8221; barrel = 7.25 lbs (almost exact)\r\nBaikal O/U 28&#8221; barrel = 7.6 lbs (approx)\r\nBaikal O/U 29.5&#8221; barrel (Sporting) = 7.9 lbs (exact)\r\n\r\nNow THREE different weights are available &#8230;. Main thing in my view is to personally inspect the weight of each and its balance (center, forward or backward bias?). Ideal weight tilt for me is &#8216;slight forward weight balance&#8217; and a &#8216;moderate weight&#8217; of 7-7.5 lbs for upland & quail.

Bro 12Gauge is right in pointing that out that barrel length is immaterial in that sense. But as far as exact weight of this gun model with barrel length of 29.5" to be exact (i.e. of Sporting ver of Baikal over & under MP27) is concerned, it is listed to be 7.9 lbs .... now that weight is one&#8217;s personal  preference. It is better to handle the gun and then compare its handling with MP-27M model in both 26&#8221; and 28&#8221; barrels (my guess would be 26&#8221; barrel would be about 7.25 lbs and 28&#8221; barrel about 7.6 lbs). However, the wider rib and the nickel finish is a plus certainly as I have extensively used a wider rib Beretta A303 (Sporting ver) with twin beads, and seen it work like magic at upland and even at skeet. So the weight and its balance (called &#8216;shotgun handling&#8217;) should be personally checked as in my opinion it is an individual choice. \r\n\r\nBaikal O/U 26&#8221; barrel = 7.25 lbs (almost exact)\r\nBaikal O/U 28&#8221; barrel = 7.6 lbs (approx)\r\nBaikal O/U 29.5&#8221; barrel (Sporting) = 7.9 lbs (exact)\r\n\r\nNow THREE different weights are available &#8230;. Main thing in my view is to personally inspect the weight of each and its balance (center, forward or backward bias?). Ideal weight tilt for me is &#8216;slight forward weight balance&#8217; and a &#8216;moderate weight&#8217; of 7-7.5 lbs for upland & quail. For skeet or any stationary hunting (like waterfowl or boar) it is no problem even with a shotgun weight of 8.5 lbs.[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nbro, in my humble experience, weight is irrelevant as long as the gun is balanced right at the center or under the forend-receiver joint (my personal preference). if you having been using a muzzle heavy A303 then I''m sure you''ll absolutely love the balance of a baikal "sporting" because it balances just one inch forward of the forend-receiver joint.\r\n\r\ndid I mention that you can easily shave off half a pound from "sporting" ?\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),
(350925, ' @12Gauge, thats good .... shaving off 1/2 lb from Sporting version (Baikal O/U). How do you achieve that?

Mine is the cz 75d compact. which is basically the cz p-01. the cz p-01 designation is for the american market and the nato forces. for international markets they sell it as the cz 75d compact. the one which national traders has with the safety is all steel and without an accessory rail the one i got has an aluminum alloy frame.\nA little more food for thought.\n\nmy model: [url]http://www.czub.cz/en/catalog/79-pistols-cz/PC/CZ_75_D_COMPACT.aspx[/url]\nsafety model : [url]http://www.czub.cz/en/catalog/79-pistols-cz/PC/CZ_75_COMPACT.aspx[/url]\n\nDifferences: Cz 75d compact weighs 800 grams. Cz 75 compact weighs 920 grams.\n                  Cz 75d compact has rubber grips. Cz 75 compact has plastic grips.\n                  Cz 75d compact has an accessory rail while the Cz 75 compact does not.\n                  Cz 75d compact magazines have a rubber base plate. Cz 75 compact magazines have a thin metal base plate.\n                  Cz 75d compact has an extended slide release while the Cz 75 compact does not.\n                  Cz 75d compact magazine release button is raised out of the frame more then the Cz 75 compact.\n                  Cz 75d compact has a lanyard loop on the butt while the Cz 75 compact does not.\n\nMy humble opinion is that the Cz 75d compact is better in all aspects then the simple version and basically it is the Cz p-01.

(351128, 'Opinion on Stoeger Model 3500 shotgun Stoeger''s Model 2000 is a very popular shotgun. It uses the same inertia operated semi-auto action as the Benelli shotguns, but at a much lower price. Earlier this year, Stoeger introduced the Model 3500 at SHOT Show, a 12 gauge 3.5" magnum version of the Model 2000.\r\nThe M3500 includes all the same features as the Model 2000, as well the addition of a mercury recoil reducer to tame the magnum recoil. Strangely enough, no doubt to save assembly costs, the recoil reducer does not come installed and requires the owner to fit it. I hope this does not become a trend and that buying a gun will not become a similar experience to buying Ikea furniture!\r\n\r\nThe Model 3500 is available with a Black Synthetic, Realtree APG and Realtree Max-4 finishs and with 24", 26" and 28" barrels. The MSRP price ranges between $629 and $679. This is about $120 more than the Model 2000.', ''),

I checked the wind and planned my stalk, and climbed up a precipitous slope to reach within a 100 yds of the trophy in about an hour or more, the light was very low as there was a haze and fog, I thought the trophy was a little further; I began to aim from a very steady sitting position with my left hand resting on a boulder with my woolen cap under it, I was so sure that I aimed, squeezed the trigger half way and released it again to recheck the range and I took a deep breath , exhaled part of it and Again re- started to take up the slack on the trigger before starting the solid aiming process and THE RIFLE FIRED while I was just beginning the aiming process\nI could have vommitted, I did not eat for a a couple of days and till today I have a racing heart beat when I remember the miffed shot.\nThe temperatures in Kakar Khurasan dip as low as 16 degrees minus in the winters and I was a 25 years old young captain not aware of gumming up of oiled triggers I was over cofident and aimed and almost before firing relaxed my trigger finger and restarted the trigger squeeze and the stuck or gummed trigger just went boom.\nWe in the infantry have a lot of pride in marksmanship and the soldiers died laughing (they are freinds and brothers ) in our infantry and they said Captain sahab may be the best shot of the regiment on Targets, but can not shoot game. Well this lasted a week or two when I dropped a 46 inch Suleman Markhore at 350 yds and a week later two Gads at between 150 and the second at 300 yards.\nEven today I go into a very sad state of mind when I think of that Gad it was the biggest I held in my sights and although I shot 3 or may be 4 Cycloceros Gads but none came even close to it in horn thickness or length and the neck ruff flarring in the wind makes me feel the animal is having a big laugh at me.', ''),

(351284, ' [QUOTE=Skeeter60;189908]No one talks of the shots he missed.\nThe year was 1974, I was camping at Qamar-ud- Din Karez at Kakar Khurasan on the Afghan border.\nThere were large numbers of Markhore and Cycloceros Gad or Urial in the mountain range towards Ashewat.\nI went there, we camped at Ashewat and left for the mountain at 2 in the morning in star light. at about 6 when the dawn was breaking I spotted a Gad on the sky line about a 1000 ft above us. I checked the wind and planned my stalk, and climbed up a precipitous slope to reach within a 100 yds of the trophy in about an hour or more, the light was very low as there was a haze and fog, I thought the trophy was a little further; I began to aim from a very steady sitting position with my left hand resting on a boulder with my woolen cap under it, I was so sure that I aimed, squeezed the trigger half way and released it again to recheck the range and I took a deep breath , exhaled part of it and Again re- started to take up the slack on the trigger before starting the solid aiming process and THE RIFLE FIRED while I was just beginning the aiming process\nI could have vommitted, I did not eat for a a couple of days and till today I have a racing heart beat when I remember the miffed shot.\nThe temperatures in Kakar Khurasan dip as low as 16 degrees minus in the winters and I was a 25 years old young captain not aware of gumming up of oiled triggers I was over cofident and aimed and almost before firing relaxed my trigger finger and restarted the trigger squeeze and the stuck or gummed trigger just went boom.\nWe in the infantry have a lot of pride in marksmanship and the soldiers died laughing (they are freinds and brothers ) in our infantry and they said Captain sahab may be the best shot of the regiment on Targets, but can not shoot game. Well this lasted a week or two when I dropped a 46 inch Suleman Markhore at 350 yds and a week later two Gads at between 150 and the second at 300 yards.\nEven today I go into a very sad state of mind when I think of that Gad it was the biggest I held in my sights and although I shot 3 or may be 4 Cycloceros Gads but none came even close to it in horn thickness or length and the neck ruff flarring in the wind makes me feel the animal is having a big laugh at me.[/QUOTE]\n very well narrated incident,\ni really like the way u expressed it in words,and i enjoyed it as if i was with u in the field that day', ''),

Well, I agree with you, and we can''t bring these two things at par by a simple barrel change, but I was merely pointing towards the accuracy syndrome, which may be pretty much barrel/rifling/grooves quality related, perhaps up to 50-75% of the aberration, remaining difference shared by other parts.\n\nI feel a harder barrel[I] substance[/I], in terms of metallurgy of the quality barrels of Berettas, may "[I]give in[/I]" lesser to the exiting rounds, and combined with better grooves, will do lots to the accuracy issues. If you remember how[I] unaffected[/I] your Glock barrel dispelled off a stuck round with a bit of force applied, I''m sure a lower quality gun barrel would not have remained that unaffected.\n\nMay I just add, for the general info of our members here, Taurus PT 99/92''s accuracy has always been reported excellent and perhaps one of the best in budget guns, Denovo bro and I are just comparing to top of the line Beretta''s.\n\nI feel we need another "battle", perhaps, now who has an original, extra barrel for sale, lolzzzzzzzz!\n\nRemember SaleemUllahKhan once advertised one.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(351392, 'Concealed-Carry &amp; Self-Defence (Handguns only) Salam friends, \r\n\r\nEver since I started carrying a concealed weapon (2009), I''ve been on the quest of gaining as much information on this subject possible. I''ve read countless amounts of threads on foreign forums about CC and Self-defense and though they were very helpful, I was never really satisfied because all of them were themed according to western societies, cultures and threats. \r\n\r\nHere in Pakistan, we know that the threats are different. The surroundings are different, the attitude is different and the mindset our criminals have, is different. Purpose of this thread is to get more aware on the SELF-DEFENSE aspect of our hobby/passion. \r\n\r\nA lot of us got our first weapon in the name of ''Self Defense''. I''ve met members here who carry their handguns in Cars and on person (concealed). Point is, if a situation arises where you have to think about drawing your firearm, what situation would that be? \r\n\r\n[b]What type of situation do you have in mind when you walk out of your home with either a weapon concealed on you, or a weapon placed strategically within your car?[/b]\r\n\r\nHere are a few things to discuss regarding CC and SD in Pakistan; \r\n\r\n[b]1. Why do you carry a firearm concealed?\r\n2. Why do you carry a firearm for SD in your car? \r\n3. Have you ever shot a firearm under stress and panic (150+ BPM)? \r\n4. Are you generally aware of your surroundings? \r\n5. Have you ever pictured a scenario where you have to draw your weapon?\r\n6. What type of scenarios are you prepared for? \r\n7. What type of threat do you believe would require you to draw your weapon?\r\n8. When carrying a handgun concealed, what methods do you utilize to make sure that    you''re the only one aware of your concealed firearm? \r\n\r\n9. When carrying concealed, do you prefer; \r\n\r\n- Round in the chamber, hammer back, safety on. \r\n- Round in the chamber, decocked. \r\n- Round in the chamber, manually riding the hammer home (Pistols without a decocker)\r\n- No round in the chamber, hammer down.\r\n\r\n10. While carrying concealed, going about your business, you hear a ''bang'', would you run away from the bang or run towards the bang? \r\n\r\n11. If you''re with your loved ones in a shopping mall, market, restaurant etc, you hear a ''bang'', what would be your plan of action? [/b]\r\n\r\nI think we should discuss ''Conceal Carry'' and ''Self Defense'' more around here simply because we all seem to have at least one weapon dedicated to the purpose of SD but are we really prepared to defend ourselves/family/friends from potential threats that we hear about everyday in the news? \r\n\r\nOn my closing note, I''d like to share this; \r\n\r\nI was sitting in a group of friends the other day and one of them told a story about his friend who was once stopped by two guys on a motorbike at gunpoint, asking for his money/wallet/phone etc. At the time of that incident, the victim was with his friend who saw the entire scenario. They were very helpful and gathered their valuables and as they handed them to the robbers, one of them said how long they''ve been waiting that night to find their targets. After that, he simply aimed and aimed to kill. \r\n\r\nThe guy on the driving seat was murdered while his friend right beside him barely escaped death because of the culprit''s poor aim and quick getaway. I''ve heard of similar stories where these ''robbers'' are actually cold-blooded murderers, prowling the streets, looking for a quick buck and a quick adrenaline rush from killing a human being. \r\n\r\nThis is just one scenario that got me wondering. Let''s all discuss this topic for everyone''s information and knowledge and I''m specially looking forward to hearing from the members who''ve been through SELF-DEFENSE scenarios in the past. We all can definitely learn from their experience.', ''),

While members will automatically enlighten, elaborate, expand and channelize this topic to fruitful learning and awareness for now I will just add to your above lines another food for thought:\n \nAnd it is; Chances of somebody being able to dominate or aggress some one else are very very high say 90% and + if that somebody has started it. What I mean here is, the one who attacks other by surprise, one who ambushes... one who is determined to assault, the one who has started it finds 90 + chances of getting successful in it. He is the Offense doer.\n \nOn the other hand, the defendant might not even know where he was hit from and the time for him has come to be slain...in case we know attacker has 90%+ success probability. \n \nIf he is a self defense believer, as we are discussing in mentioned topic, he needs to literally reverse the ill effect from 90% success probability of attacker back to his own regime. It is hell of a difficult job of handicap nature. \n \nVery precise qualitative and quantitative measures will only help you to dominate the ambush scenario.', ''),

(351477, ' It is delightful to note that the thread was started by a ''lord of war'' and was answered beautifully by another ''lord of war''. Lords of war are surely the best people to discuss the very art of it. :)\n\nI am not a veteran at these forums but I will share with you some of my preparation and battery, adding to Faisji Brother''s appreciated input. First a little about the CCW in PK (copy/paste from my article):\n\n--- begin paste ---\n\nUnlike in many other countries, buying and carrying a firearm in PK is different. The difference can be traced on three major levels and I will briefly touch upon each of these:\n\n1. The Legal Dimension:\n\nEveryone knows about the rule of law in Pakistan. We lag behind all developed and most of the developing countries as well-educated law-abiding citizens. There are many factors contributing to the fact, but the bottom line is that owning a gun in PK is not thought of as a huge responsibility or an attitude-altering event.\n\nMost people who carry around here, to the best of my knowledge, are either hobbyists or people with enmity/vendetta. There are very few people (extremely few in fact) that I know of who belong to the middle-employed-class who carry a gun for self/home defense. \n\nGetting a licence through means of bribe, hush-money and ''sifarish'' is common. Most repercussions that play a huge role in affecting the CCW decision of an individual do not play an important role in PK. The legal system is corrupt and there are many loop holes awaiting to be exploited by individuals in power (with a ''back'' or money).\n\n2. The Cultural Dimension\n\nAdding to the above factors, the displaying of the owned firearms has become a huge cultural component in PK over the years. "Air Firing" is common on cultural events, most prominent of which are the "Shab-e-Bara''at" and Wedding Ceremonies. \n\nIt is common for people with enmity/vendetta to proudly display their guns in public and ''feel'' safe. To some extend, it has become a boost for their egos, and added edge to their psyches.\n\n3. The Personal Dimension\n\nLastly, a noticeable thing about the gun community of PK (that I am familiar with) is the lack of training. There are virtually no means for civilians to get firearm training in PK and almost all serious gun-owners in PK rely on skills learnt through random shooting at the ranges. \n\nThere is something known as the Conceal and Carry Attitude or CCA in foreign communities which addresses responsibility. When you buy a firearm, you have to have to realize that it is a 24/7 responsibility that you cannot ever escape. A question a gun-owner needs to ask him/herself is that is he/she an asset to the society or a threat? It is not a source of power or is meant to save your ego but an emergency life-saving tool that you have to employ ONLY when your or one of your family member''s life is in danger. You have to heighten the awareness of your surroundings and train efficiently with a holster if you plan to carry. You have to learn the five laws of safety by heart and then keep practicing with them regularly to not to forget or take for granted any one of these.\n\nIt is tempting to show your firearm off or fire in air on occasions but we should all keep in mind that that is illegal. It doesn''t matter if we can get away with it or not, something wrong stays wrong even if one can evade getting punished for it.\n\n---end paste---\n\nNow to your questions.\n\n"A lot of us got our first weapon in the name of ''Self Defense''. I''ve met members here who carry their handguns in Cars and on person (concealed). Point is, if a situation arises where you have to think about drawing your firearm, what situation would that be? "\n\nFirst of all brother, we need to understand something called ''state of mind'' which is a pscyho-physiological state (not the other way around). Irrespective of the situation, human mind needs to be trained in terms of situational awareness, wiliness to kill in defense, and willingness to live with the trauma of the combat which may include physical aftermath, legal penalties, emotional stress or psychological complications. A good starting point maybe Jeff Cooper''s "color code" system (pasted from wikipedia for ease of access):\n\n------ begin paste ------\n\nThe color code, as originally introduced by Jeff Cooper, had nothing to do with tactical situations or alertness levels, but rather with one''s state of mind. As taught by Cooper, it relates to the degree of peril you are willing to do something about and which allows you to move from one level of mindset to another to enable you to properly handle a given situation. Cooper did not claim to have invented anything in particular with the color code, but he was apparently the first to use it as an indication of mental state.[6]\n\nWhite - Unaware and unprepared. If attacked in Condition White, the only thing that may save you is the inadequacy or ineptitude of your attacker. When confronted by something nasty, your reaction will probably be "Oh my God! This can''t be happening to me."\n\nYellow - Relaxed alert. No specific threat situation. Your mindset is that "today could be the day I may have to defend myself". You are simply aware that the world is a potentially unfriendly place and that you are prepared to defend yourself, if necessary. You use your eyes and ears, and realize that "I may have to shoot today". You don''t have to be armed in this state, but if you are armed you should be in Condition Yellow. You should always be in Yellow whenever you are in unfamiliar surroundings or among people you don''t know. You can remain in Yellow for long periods, as long as you are able to "Watch your six." (In aviation 12 o''clock refers to the direction in front of the aircraft''s nose. Six o''clock is the blind spot behind the pilot). In Yellow, you are "taking in" surrounding information in a relaxed but alert manner, like a continuous 360 degree radar sweep. As Cooper put it, "I might have to shoot."\n\nOrange - Specific alert. Something is not quite right and has your attention. Your radar has picked up a specific alert. You shift your primary focus to determine if there is a threat (but you do not drop your six). Your mindset shifts to "I may have to shoot that person today", focusing on the specific target which has caused the escalation in alert status. In Condition Orange, you set a mental trigger: "If that person does "X", I will need to stop them". Your pistol usually remains holstered in this state. Staying in Orange can be a bit of a mental strain, but you can stay in it for as long as you need to. If the threat proves to be nothing, you shift back to Condition Yellow.\n\nRed - Condition Red is fight. Your mental trigger (established back in Condition Orange) has been tripped. "If "X" happens I will shoot that person".\n\n---- end paste -----\n\nThis color code is perfectly applicable in any and all situations in Pakistan for the "situation" is being rendered irrelevant while training the mind for combat. This color code is pretty similar to what Massad Ayoob teaches in his classes about combative mindset, though his way of putting it is a little more complex. Jim Cirillo also talks about this kind of a mindset in his "Guns Bullets and Gunfights" book. It is an absolutely essential ''skill'' to acquire.\n\nMr. Cooper''s book "Basics of Self Defense" lists seven principles of SD:\n\n1. Alertness\n2. Decisiveness \n3. Aggressiveness \n4. Speed \n5. Coolness \n6. Ruthlessness\n7. Surprise\n\nThese principles are to be employed and made an essential part of the defensive repertoire. In other words, these seven principle form the backbone of a Conceal Carry Attitude. \n\n\n"What type of situation do you have in mind when you walk out of your home with either a weapon concealed on you, or a weapon placed strategically within your car?"\n\nAny and all situations that trigger the "KEYWORD" "THREAT"! And a real threat is always to life, not to property! I am of the view that if you find yourself in a situation where some petty mug is asking you for a wallet on the gunpoint holding a cheap gun which he probably doesn''t even know how to dissemble, you have failed already! You were not aware of  your surroundings while carrying and thats a fatal mistake that cannot be forgiven. It is better to hand him over the wallet and just get out of the situation instead of trying to do a fast draw and fight him. If, however, you know that he''s gonna kill you... well you are probably already dead! You died the moment he gained tempi on you, closing in on your ''personal space'', and pulled his gun on you, brass in chamber, hammer cocked, finger on trigger! \n\nThe best defense is ALWAYS (and there are no exceptions to THIS rule) to AVOID a dangerous situation! Keep an eye on your 6 O'' clock... always. ''Cuz thats where most of the threats come from.\n\nIf you are home, it is a different situation. There someone has entered in ON your property. The above rule, however, is applicable to this situation as well. Keep your home secured without depending on a weapon cuz thats the last resort. Choose better doors and windows. Dont get cheap on those basic necessities. Choose better locks. Always plan in architecture a ''safe room''. etc etc\n\n"1. Why do you carry a firearm concealed?"\n\nText book reply: Because the constitution of Pakistan has established my right to defend myself as one of the basic human rights as outlined by the UN. I carry a weapon to defend myself and my family in threatening situations, if the need of the said arises. (this is the answer you should practice if you are to appear before court)\n\nFrankly: ''cuz I can. ''cuz I decide to. ''cuz I am willing to fight and defend myself and my my family. Period!\n\n\n2. Why do you carry a firearm for SD in your car? \n\nI don''t. I think its pointless to place it somewhere in you car. I always carry it on MYSELF irrespective of modes of transportation. Needs lots of training to be able to draw it from a sitting position effectively with a seat belt. Even more training to draw it one handed while driving a bike. So you should be prepared for those stressful trainings if you are willing to defend yourself.\n\nWhy I think its pointless to carry it in your car? cuz I dont think its consistent with my training of ''presentation'' of the weapon and it is difficult to effectively employ my weapon system if it is placed on the seat or worse still in the glove compartment. I need to have it on me, in the same place where it always is, if a dangerous situation arises.\n\n"3. Have you ever shot a firearm under stress and panic (150+ BPM)? "\n\nYes.\n\n"4. Are you generally aware of your surroundings? "\n\nPlease elaborate on ''generally''. Mostly I am. Or at least try to.\n\nA quote from Mr. Cooper comes to mind while addressing this question:\n\n"Observe your cat. It is difficult to surprise him. Why?\nNaturally his superior hearing is part of the answer, but not\nall of it. He moves well, using his senses fully. He is not\npreoccupied with irrelevancies. He''s not thinking about his\njob or his image or his income tax. He is putting first things\nfirst, principally his physical security. Do likewise."\n\nUnlike the ''cat'' we may sometimes be occupied with other thoughts and neglect our surroundings. That''s precisely why we train. To achieve a level of mental alertness where it becomes structured into our psyches like subconscious.\n\n5. Have you ever pictured a scenario where you have to draw your weapon?\n\nI have trained with multiple scenarios yes. Is it helpful in real situations? My personal experience says sometimes it aint. Wouldn''t want to elaborate on this tough.\n\nMy experience is: train with consistency. Even if you are training for multiple scenarios, make you draws, acquiring sights, reloading habits, etc. etc, consistent. The more you train with the same movement, the more muscle memory you will have. And then when you are experiencing the Tachypsychia in an adrenaline rush, your muscles will know what to do even if your rationale doesnt.\n\nIf, on the other hand, your question is about the mental preparedness, then I have addressed it already. If you are asking specifically if I have the guts to go all the way or not, then I would take the fifth ;) (meaning I would politely refuse to answer the question).\n\n6. What type of scenarios are you prepared for? \n\nAnswered above. \n\nFemales should also be prepared for scenarios involving sexual harassment. It is a complicated matter to define the boundaries. The rule of the thumb is, if it has exceeded from the verbal and enters the physical, then its time to take action. Formal complaints can now be made against the verbal or the gestural.\n\n7. What type of threat do you believe would require you to draw your weapon?\n\nA threat to life. Period. Forget the rest!\n\n8. When carrying a handgun concealed, what methods do you utilize to make sure that you''re the only one aware of your concealed firearm? \n\nSorry can''t answer that ;)\n\n"9. When carrying concealed, do you prefer; \n\n- Round in the chamber, hammer back, safety on. \n- Round in the chamber, decocked. \n- Round in the chamber, manually riding the hammer home (Pistols without a decocker)\n- No round in the chamber, hammer down."\n\n1911... condition ONE. Sometimes though, I also carry in Israeli condition (no round in chamber, hammer down, fully loaded magazine inserted)\n\n10. While carrying concealed, going about your business, you hear a ''bang'', would you run away from the bang or run towards the bang? \n\nDepends on the situation. Normally AWAY from the bang to a safer place where I can safely assess the situation first, like ducking behind a cover etc. If the situation is crowded, I would not draw. If not, then this ducking etc would happen while drawing and moving.\n\n11. If you''re with your loved ones in a shopping mall, market, restaurant etc, you hear a ''bang'', what would be your plan of action? [/b]\n\nAn extremely difficult situation. The gut-reaction would be to shield my loved ones and find a safe exit. If confrontation is at hand, then would engage ruthlessly with the assailants in order to save the lives of my loved ones. However, if God Forbid it is a terrorist attack, then the only resort is to act as a human shield for your loved ones. Like I said, an extremely difficult situation.\n\nI would rather do the shopping and outing by myself lol hahahahhahaha\n\nSeriously though, it is already a lose lose situation if you have to defend not only yourself but your family members also ALL ALONE with as inadequate a weapon as a handgun. I''d rather have an extra piece on me and give it to another family member in a situation like this at least to have a leverage. When planning visits to places to shop, I''d choose a supermarket like Pace etc which is well guarded if possible instead of taking them to anarkali or window shopping on the roads. While choosing a restaurant again would like to scan for those who at least have some kind of security measures available. Would always try to get seats with their backs to concrete walls where I could keep an eye on the surrounding.\n\n"I think we should discuss ''Conceal Carry'' and ''Self Defense'' more around here simply because we all seem to have at least one weapon dedicated to the purpose of SD but are we really prepared to defend ourselves/family/friends from potential threats that we hear about everyday in the news? "\n\n+1\n\n"On my closing note, I''d like to share this; \n\nI was sitting in a group of friends the other day and one of them told a story about his friend who was once stopped by two guys on a motorbike at gunpoint, asking for his money/wallet/phone etc. At the time of that incident, the victim was with his friend who saw the entire scenario. They were very helpful and gathered their valuables and as they handed them to the robbers, one of them said how long they''ve been waiting that night to find their targets. After that, he simply aimed and aimed to kill. \n\nThe guy on the driving seat was murdered while his friend right beside him barely escaped death because of the culprit''s poor aim and quick getaway. I''ve heard of similar stories where these ''robbers'' are actually cold-blooded murderers, prowling the streets, looking for a quick buck and a quick adrenaline rush from killing a human being. \n\nThis is just one scenario that got me wondering. Let''s all discuss this topic for everyone''s information and knowledge and I''m specially looking forward to hearing from the members who''ve been through SELF-DEFENSE scenarios in the past. We all can definitely learn from their experience."\n \nAn extremely rare case in everyday Pakistani situation. However, like I said above, if you have allowed someone to gain on your personal space, then you have almost lost the war already.  Sun Tzu has some very wise things to say in this regard in his magnum opus. The time and space are the keys. Battles are not won by firearms, but by preparation and readiness. \n\nOn an ending note, I would like to draw your attention to the religious factor also. It is a huge part of our culture. The forum rules do not allow me to engage in discussion on this dimension... however please note that the situational awareness in Pakistan doesn''t work the same way as in many other cultures. Here you have a closeness to other people which is shared through a common religion/culture. We hug people that we know when we meet not just shake hands. If you are carrying, a hug is the last thing you should aim for. But if you deny a hug to someone you know, you would appear rude and might damage your relationship with the guy. Also people around here are accustomed to sit close to each other even if they are strangers. Over 78 percent of the population travels on buses. etc etc. It is my personal experience that in order for you to develop the right kind of situational awareness in PK, you should be prepared to accept a certain level of seclusion... both emotional and physical. \n\nLike I said, forum rules do not allow me to dwell on this subject in detail. But I have mentioned some pointers here. Hopefully these won''t go unnoticed ;)\n\nBe safe! You and your family!\nCD\n:rockon:', ''),

What I mean here is, the one who attacks other by surprise, one who ambushes... one who is determined to assault, the one who has started it finds 90 + chances of getting successful in it.

It is hell of a difficult job of handicap nature. \n \nVery precise qualitative and quantitative measures will only help you to dominate the ambush scenario.[/QUOTE]\n \nIf you are being ambushed, and you are not aware of the potential threat and don''t have the required skill and awareness to deal with it, then well you are almost as good as dead.

Google earth is a neglected resource in this regard. How many times have we actually studied the map of the specific area that we live and work in? Or how many times have we tried to explore new routes to work and look for intersections? \n\nIf it is likely that you would be ambushed, then your life has already been changed.

My demise is humane. It is a fact that cannot be changed. If the time has come, it has come. So be it. Put some of that brass in my flesh and see if that stops me from spitting blood in your face! The difference arises where I CHOOSE TO fight. Win or loss is irrelevant.\n\nThat is a little different from saying that I accept whatever fate has in its scrolls to offer. Instead it is saying that I will accept the consequences of my placement, my will and the resulting action. The only absolute end a true Muslim has in his mind is the hereafter.

(351501, ' a little off topic,yet a funny story:-\nin early days of the last duck season we (me,my younger and elder brother) found a very good spot for duck hunting.we reached there early (about 6) in morning,spread decoys,camouflaged, and finally got 4 or 5 teals till 9am.i was getting bored and giving my gun i said to my younger brother "time for u to show some shooting skills on ducks"lols.i said them i will join u after a short break,i am going to drink fresh water from a hand water pump (nalka)  (about 150meter behind side of our spot) and i will be watching your game from there.\nas i left the blind,drank water and sat on the bank of the canal passing nearby,started watching them from that point,there started the duck movement.the ducks were coming towards the decoys but every time at a certain point they turned back,about 4 or 5 times this happened,alot of ducks came towards the decoy but they turned back and not a single flock was properly decoyed,i started getting angry and called  my brothers but there was some network problem there.when ever a flock turned away i even shouted loudly and angrily (oyeeeee ooooooooo, o ke kar ray o)!!!!  but no response from their side.\nthen i decided to go back to the blind,i reached there,i saw both of my brothers were talking and laughing loudly.i said angrily "both of you are the most irresponsible hunters ever in the hundreds of thousands  years old history of hunting and both of u dont even deserve a gun"\nthey said in a funny and light mode how can u say this??? this made me more angry and i said "lanat payjo swairay swairay uthan tay,aae wadday shakari,murghabi utay ud rae a tay a thallay hus ray nay,wa g wa"\nthey again started laughing loudly hhahahahhahahahhaha............i dont know what happened to me  i also started laughing with them first slowly and then at their tempo.\nafter we managed ourselves to get rid out of this laughing,they told me that they were well aware of the ducks coming towards decoys and that they were properly camouflaged.they told me that ducks were out of the firing range  and returned back all the time,and they were themselves confused that what is happening here.................and then he told me further when last flock came and it was about to decoy,they suddenly heard the sound of somebody few meters behind their blind.......and that was a abot 20year old paindu (holding a stick in his hand and saying tha tha...dazzz.....dazzz) \n(mentally  out) saying them in punjabi "a ke dramay bazi lae j"??? my brothers replied "we r hunters,get camouflaged ducks r over the head" then he said "wah g wah sanu paghal samagday nay shehar walay,udan walian batka(ducks)"and he again replied pointing towards the decoys "a jairay under nay o maar lay j"??? and then he started a series of questions\n"a rifle ooothay (pointing about 1km away) tak mar laynde a ??? "a mar k khanday o" etc etc\nthe one thing he was frequently saying during all this conversation was "acha acha shakari o....hmmm....tay mar day o parinday...hmmmmmmm...shakari ooooo.............."\nafter hearing all this story all of 3 of us started laughing again.\n\nthis is on top of the funny hunting incidents of my life and even today,some times when we talk about some hunting memories my younger brother says me in the same way as that boy said "shakari oooo??? marday o parinday???? and then he adds sharam nae j aande" and it makes us to laugh in the same manner as we did on that  day in the field.\n@ avais bro\nthis is the incident of same day of this hunting season when u,uncle gul,shery and zaraq met us on the canal.', ''),

(351569, ' [QUOTE=nisar;190292]All discussion is very interesting. But my question is:\n\nHow we can train us for these kind of situations?\n\n1. Discussing here? \n2. Watching youtubes? \n3. Roaming forums? \n4. Reading books? \n\nWhat is the solution?[/QUOTE]\n \nThats only the theoretical aspect of it. You need to first know the theoretical basis of handgun fighting and then you should put your knowledge into action by training with or without a partner on a private range. Since we do not have any civilian combative training institute in PK, this is the only way available to us.\n\nI''d suggest you look at some good videos on youtube about the stance, trigger break, sight picture etc etc, and then you should practice with the different philosophies you''ll come across and choose the best method for you. For example choosing between the weaver or  isosceles, or using modified weaver or even the modified isosceles taught by Mr. Burkett. Obviously before moving to stance you need to first find the best handgun you could shoot well, the best carry holster you can draw from and the best method of presentation that suites you.\n\nFor clarification, let me break down the process of self-training for you that I find most beneficial.\n\n__________________\n\nA. The theory PART I\n\n1. Ballistics (calibers and their damage charts etc)\n2. Handgun basics (design basics, pros and cons of different designs etc)\n3. Holster basics (which holster to use in which scenario, difference between different holster types etc)\n4. Gun belts and clothing (for conceal and carry)\n\nAfter you have done the above research on the internet, you choose a gun, get a licence, a cc permit, and bring the gun home with some ammo.\n\nB. Practical PART I\n\n1. First look at your gun (disassembly, cleaning and lubrication, scanning for weaknesses etc). Obviously these you would accomplish through the theoretical knowledge that you already have acquired through research in part I.\n2. Getting to know your gun (getting to know about its functions in detail and getting comfortable with it. for example a DA/SA gun that you''d buy would probably come with a decocking lever. you need to understand its function and practice with it to get comfortable with that particular function of your gun)\n3. Choosing a holster and experimenting with it\n4. Choosing a good belt \n\nC. Theory Part II\n\n1. Learning basics of presentation methods (draw techniques etc)\n\n....... and this model of theory and practice would continue....', ''),

(351645, ' [B][U]1.) Browning Auto:[/U][/B] Perhaps no other shotgun brought so much to the hunter as the venerable hump-backed Automatic-5. In 1903, it heralded the way for every semi-automatic shotgun to follow. Although gas-operation overtook this recoil-operated classic five years short of its centenary, much of the operation is common to both type guns.\r\n\r\n[B][U]2.) Manton Side-by-Side:[/U][/B] Joseph Manton (1766-1835) is the British gunmaker who established the final form of the side-by-side. Over the years, ignition systems changed, and mechanical refinements followed, but the form of the double from Manton''s shotguns remains.\r\n\r\n[B][U]3.) Winchester Model 1897:[/U][/B] The exposed-hammer Winchester 1897 spawned all the pumps that followed. Although Christopher Spencer''s Model 1890 pump was first, it was the Browning-designed 1897 that was the first truly successful repeating shotgun; it remained in inventory until 1957. \r\n\r\n[B][U]4.) Browning Superposed:[/U][/B]Compared with today''s too-light over/unders, the Superposed had the right heft to shoot heavy field loads and help complete the swing, not to mention durability. It was the first over/under to be truly affordable.\r\n\r\n[B][U]5.) A.H. Fox Super Fox: [/U][/B]Built with heavy barrels on an equally heavy action, the Super Fox was the first true waterfowl shotgun. Patterns with Western Cartridge''s then-new Super-X ammo were a guaranteed 80 percent at 40 yards. Today backboring is touted as new, but the Super Fox was first back in 1922.\r\n\r\n[B][U]6.) Boss Over/Under:[/U][/B] The Purdey is but a pallid approximation of the Boss. Why not have the first? It incorporated trunnion-pivoted barrels with low-mounted locking lugs, ejectors mounted on the barrels and sleek lines. \r\n\r\n[B][U]7.) Remington 870:[/U][/B] They''ve sold 10 million, but the stock dimensions are mired in the 1950s. The 870 is a hard worker, and the ability to make it in a variety of models from dirt cheap to exquisite is genius.\r\n\r\n[B][U]8.) Remington Sportsman 58:[/U][/B] I guess if you''ve only shot Remington 1100s you wouldn''t know any better, but anyone who has shot an S-58 will agree it''s the very best pointing and handling semi-auto ever made.\r\n\r\n[B][U]9.) Winchester Model 21: [/U][/B]The Winchester 21 is a tough, well-designed gun. From its truly selective single trigger to its fabulously strong barrel steel, it''s a tank.\r\n\r\n[B][U]10.) Galazan: [/U][/B]If I had a sheik''s ransom to spend, it would be on one of Tony Galazan''s made-in-America over/unders or side-by-sides.', ''),

A loader stands close behind the shooter, ready to take his Lordship''s empty gun and hand him a loaded one.\r\n\r\nPrice: $120,000 (pair) \r\nGauge: 12 \r\n\r\n2. L.C. Smith Monogram American double shotguns flourished from the 1890s until shortly after World War II, when the public demand for cheaper, mass-produced pump and semiautomatic guns killed the old classics. \r\n\r\nThe high grade L.C. Smiths like this Monogram Grade were among the most heavily decorated guns made during the so-called Golden Age of American shotguns, in the 1930s and 40s. This heavyweight gun accepts powerful magnum loads intended for high-flying ducks and geese.\r\n\r\nPrice: $12,000 \r\nGauge: 12 \r\n\r\n3. Perazzi SCO Sporting \r\nPerazzi''s earned public notoriety recently as Vice President Cheney''s gun of choice for quail and attorneys. Shotgun aficionados, however, have long known these wonderfully sleek Italian guns as winners of countless target shooting titles. \r\n\r\nPerazzis debuted in the early 60s, and ever since they''ve been among the top guns of international competitors. This beautifully engraved SCO model is made for Sporting Clays. \r\n\r\nPrice: $25,000 \r\nGauge: 12 \r\n\r\n4. Krieghoff K-80 \r\nAmong competitive trap and skeet shooters, the name "Kreighoff" represents the last word in target-crushing consistency. Machined with Teutonic precision in Ulm, Germany, the K-80 isn''t sleek, but it''s built to shoot forever. \r\n\r\nThis K-80 comes with four sets of barrels for skeet competition in four different events. It''s been decorated with gold engraved ducks and pheasants to remind the owner of days afield.\r\n\r\nPrice: $13,500 \r\nGauge: 12, 20, 28 and .410 barrels \r\n\r\n5. Browning Superposed \r\nJohn Browning of Morgan, Utah, was the greatest, most prolific inventor of both sporting and military guns in modern times. \r\n\r\nHis last gun, the Superposed, was an expensive gun that debuted just in time for the Depression. Its Belgian factory was occupied by the Nazis in World War II, but the Superposed survived to achieve tremendous popularity by the 1960s. \r\n\r\nSuperposeds remain in production as custom order guns today. The Midas grade model, with its gold inlaid pheasants and ducks, is one of the most lavishly decorated models.\r\n\r\nPrice: $21,500 \r\nGauge: 410 \r\n\r\n6. Beretta SO-4 \r\nAfter 475 years in the gun business, you would think Beretta might have learned a thing or two about making shotguns. They have: The SO-series guns stand among the world''s finest. Even at their premium prices, SO guns are a relative bargain with fit, finish and engineering the equal of guns costing much more. \r\n\r\nThis S0-4 will withstand decades of high volume skeet shooting, and still look gorgeous in the winner''s circle.\r\n\r\nPrice: $8,125 \r\nGauge: 12 \r\n\r\n7. Fabbri Over-Under \r\nThink of Italy''s Fabbris as the Lamborghinis of shotguns -- stunning blends of beauty and performance at a "if you have to ask, you can''t afford it" price. Fabbri makes just a handful of guns a year for such luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Tom Selleck and King Juan Carlos of Spain, among others. \r\n\r\nThe swirling brown and blue patterns on the steel of this gun are the result of case coloring, a process in which the metal parts are hardened by heating them in a steel box with charcoal, bone and leather.\r\n\r\nPrice: $82,500 \r\nGauge: 12 \r\n\r\n8. Boss O/U \r\nEnglish makers are known for their side by side shotguns (barrels arranged alongside one another), but the Boss O/U (barrels stacked vertically) is a graceful exception to the rule, and first appeared in 1909. \r\n\r\nThis 1925 example is a beautiful between-the-wars gun. Light in weight for easy carrying in the field, this gun is richly decorated with the rose and scroll pattern typical of British "Best" grade guns.\r\n\r\nPrice: $48,000 \r\nGauge: 12 \r\n\r\n9. Cosmi Autoloader \r\nMeticulously hand-fitted parts and a complex design set the Cosmi apart from mass produced semi-automatic, making it by far the most expensive repeating shotgun in the world. \r\n\r\nThe Cosmi''s ingenious self-loading mechanism dates to 1925 and requires over 100 hand-fitted internal parts; it''s the Swiss watch of fine shotguns. Cosmis hold up to eight shells in a tubular magazine in the buttstock. Famous -- or perhaps infamous -- Cosmi owners include Leonid Brezhnev and Benito Mussolini.\r\n\r\nPrice: $8,250 \r\nGauge: 20 \r\n\r\n10. Connecticut Shotgun Manuf. Co. Model 21\r\nOf all the American classic doubles that disappeared following the end of World War II, the Winchester Model 21 lasted the longest, limping along on life-support until the early 80s. \r\n\r\nThe 21 is one of the classics revived by Connecticut Shotgun Manufacturing Company, which owns that Winchester model''s name and patent. Made right here in the U.S. the guns are probably built better now than they ever were. \r\n\r\nPrice: $19,500 \r\nGauge: 16 \r\n\r\nCourtesy: [url]http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0801/gallery.collectorguns.fortune//index.html[/url]', ''),

(351696, ' [QUOTE=AK47;190404]@CD bro... Whenever you get a chance to step out of your books, literature and philosophical world, you may come to understand that negative vibes/vendettas/enmities, etc, stretch beyond Sultan Rahi and Mustafa Qureshi, and are not class oriented at all. Can happen anywhere, we''re still not sufficiently civilized, sadly. Regards.[/QUOTE]\n \n\n\nAK bro, you judge me... and have been judging me all along. And you dont know anything about me. If I appear respectful and indulge in discussions in scholarly fashion it doesnt mean I lack the motivation to aim a piece and pull the trigger, neither does it reflect on my previous experiences of dire situation with multiple assailants. Most of the gun owners around here are hobbyists, I am a gun owner cuz I NEED a gun. You might wanna rethink your judgement pertaining to the specificity as to WHY I NEED a gun and carry it on me 24/7. For fun or Sultan Rahish ambitions?\n\nI understand your vendetta/enmity pov. I was just making a point where my personal experience has shown me multiple times that people who can AFFORD to keep a vendetta or enmity are the ones who have at least some sort of financial and political backing available to them, even links with local desperadoes/petty badmashs. Kalashans and Triple Twos don''t come in cheap. And when killings happen on both sides, you need lots of resources to get out of the fix, or at least some sort of webbing tactics to avoid immediate penalty/repercussion. Most middle class ''safaid posh'' people cannot afford these. Especially people with principles who refuse to become as corrupt as the system itself. Most of the middle class people don''t even have enough necessities to begin with what to talk about enmity etc which is a luxury for them. The only type of enmity I have seen in these people is based on honor stuff. And that too is often settled through court or local panchayat, not firearms and deadly tactics. People who ''most of the times'' acquire enmities are precisely looking for these... and the subculture I have mentioned in my earlier post hints at societal formation of the very attitude of "teri to..." resulting from this subculture. Of course there''ll always be exceptions to rules.\n\nI see the same attitude of discarding anything based on sound studies and theory as impractical on these forums as it is with our Pakistani society, which is a very dangerous attitude to say the least. In your old times brother, the knowledge of combat was limited and most of the people only got half-baked information through social interaction with their peers, through some practical incidents or cultural shooting traits which may or may not have been sufficient in terms of adequacy. Times have changed now and we have more knowledge bases available to us. It does not mean you live in books or movies, for these are merely entertainment habits of an individual. But to discard all sound knowledge based on a mere prejudice against books, scholarship and theory is hardly a wise approach.\n\nSuffices to say that whatever I have said above is not mere theory, but repeated practice based on modern art of gunfighting.\n\nI must say here, that when I joined these forums I was willing to share whatever knowledge base I had available to me. But the general attitude on these forums has discouraged me multiple times and amused me to a point where now I think its pointless to indulge into any meaningful discussion on these forums, and hence you can see I have limited my interaction and indulgence on these forums. Investing time into discussions has no meaning if there is no fruitful learning involved. I''ll further limit it sir, lest you think somebody as bookish as me has nothing to share at all. ;) I am entertained! :)\n\nRegards dear sir.\nCD.', ''),

Paper targets dont shoot back. However, I must add that there nevertheless are benefits of educated training and modern day techniques.

For your consideration, here is Google''s definition:\n\n________________________________\nven·det·ta\nnoun&#8195;/ven&#712;det&#601;/&#8195;\nvendettas, plural\n\nA blood feud in which the family of a murdered person seeks vengeance on the murderer or the murderer''s family\n\nA prolonged bitter quarrel with or campaign against someone\n- he has accused the British media of pursuing a vendetta against him\n____________________________\n\nI guess you were using the term in a different meaning, perhaps in synonymity to general enmity. However, this is a very specific term and to the best of my knowledge, vendettas are limited to rural areas for most part in today''s world. It is also my experience as my father quit his land and went abroad for studies to get out of the vicious circle of fruitless vendetta very early in his life. \n\nI have also used enmity in specific frame of reference, where it is an enmity for blood based on previous grievances of extreme nature. In everyday urban life, you don''t acquire enmities just cuz somebody has abused you in a fight over a better spot at a restaurant, or just cuz you were in an accident where the mistake in rules of traffic was committed by the other person who also happens to be a knucklehead and is far from being polite. Enmities are a thirst for blood, where families have been ruined for a piece of land or a petty matter that turned into murders of children and women.\n\nI am really interested in knowing what kind of enmities you can acquire in modern everyday urban life? If you can please elaborate on this, I''d be thankful. Hopefully, one of your examples wont include the incidents of physical fights over the so called ''girlfriends''... hahahahhaahah lol', ''),

Are there any specific things you take into account, scan for, and prepare for?

Like I said above, I felt the comment was personal, and thought it was tasteless. It is not to say that I minded it or that I was angry in any way or anything of the sort. I have lots of respect for him, and if you search for our previous interactions I have displayed my gratitude numerous times to him. There is absolutely no question of me minding anything he says... he never says anything of the sort to begin with :)\n\nAbout your advise. Again you''d say I am elaborating too much, but understand that art of precise and crisp language where saying less is saying more is an art from the many arts of war. You direct crisp precise sentences at an individual or a group with whom you are not comfortable making conversations. It is not a mode of normal friendly everyday social interaction, unless somebody thinks he is the Bonaparte of future. However, you have already seen me limiting my discussions and your advise is further noted in this regard.\n\nThere is no question of minding dear brother. It is quite naive to think ''free speech'' and frank discussion is ''minding''. We all have a right to disagree with any opinion or premise, and disagreement is not ''minding''.\n\nHopefully, I was precise in this thread ;)\n\nRegards,\nCD.\n\nEdit: Perhaps my comments on discouragement made you think I minded Ak bro''s comments.

This will force your opponent to rethink a couple of times, as far as the conventional one-on-one affair is concerned,  and as regards the "unconventional" approach , means "organized assault", well, it''s not for the average Joe of opponents to arrange such in a swift move, giving you a time-delay effect at least, if not total abolishment considerations to the would-be assailant.

(351790, ' [FONT=Calibri]During a border area expedition we were wondering around in search of some big game over an open jeep. We were 4 in total. As this was a very particular visit and there was no guide / helper was available. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]I was a spot light carrier because I had availed my chance, while Saad my buddy was holding a 30-06 and standing beside me. Elder brother was driving CJ5 and Doc. Salman Bukhari our teammate was sitting at adjacent seat. He was holding a repeater filled with heavy loads.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]There were two more guns (a pair) laying over Jeep&#8217;s bonnet which were obviously mine one filled with Heavy loads and other with 6#. Another DBBL was also there belongs to my brother which was also bearing small pallets because his riffle was also ready and fixed at his right panel.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]This was the all arsenal which was ready to welcome any game species at any distance. Sorry, few, pistols (30, 9mm) were etc. were also part of that fully packed commando mission.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]Story starts now:-[/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]Travelling along with series of lights we reached a place where further travel was not possible because there was a big water channel and we started moving backwards taking some different route. I was the light owner and directing the trajectories.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]Suddenly while I moved the spot light to our left over a turn. Next question which arise in my mind was &#8220;What is that????&#8220; i whispered &#8220;Rooko Rooko&#8221; and started gazing at an animal which was standing our way. I again undertone &#8220;SUUR&#8221; (Boar). MY brother shouted &#8220;Na Marna Kaatta Jey Kattaa&#8221; (Dn&#8217;t shoot it&#8217;s a BULL). [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]It all happened in just a while and he raised his head and it was needless to say that was a gigantic boar which we all can never forget in our life. For an instance we all stunned but Doc. Salman was first who took the aim but till date I am surprised what he was hitting because if someone intentionally wants to miss him he cannot. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]DUZ DUZ DUZ close range shots but resultless. The Boar turned and started walking ahead with a slow speed at a distance not more then 15-20 meter (max) to our left. It was Saad&#8217;s tern now, who was holding 30-06. Meanwhile, doctor sb fired the remaining 2. Boar was still going slowly and trying to find some place to enter thick Bella thus why he was slow. Saad took aim but missed because jeep was also travelling with the same speed and track was not smooth, he clearly missed few fit to our side, bolts it again and fired simultaneously but all bullets missed. I shouted saad hold this light now. My brother helped me and I got my gun over my shoulder now. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]Boar after so many fires and failing to find any place to enter inside Bella turned right towards the track on which we were travelling and sprinted like a panther. Meanwhile, I was ready to hit this beast. Before he could cross the track I took aim and shoot, failed. Next one hit on back legs (distance 10 mtr) and another it also hit but pest started full throttle. He was a ghost??? afer hitting so many pallets he was enjoying his sprinting and teasing us.[/FONT]\n \n \n[FONT=Calibri]It was a strange position boar was running on a very bad track with full speed and my brother was also following him with more speed and he wants to take him underneath. [/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]We all were helpless because he was so close where shooting him can be very dangerous. Suddenly my brother put his feet over the break paddle and we felt that now he will provide us chance to hit him again but he used the break in a way that we both (standing behind) couldn&#8217;t managed to keep ourselves standing and we rolled over the center pipe and next while we were in driving area with legs pointing upwards.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]There were several questions which arose to my mind like brother pick a punishment for us on such a bad missing or another thing which came in my mind were some mechanical particle damaged due to which its chocked badly etc. etc. One thing was however was clear in mind that I have many small scratches and bones were feeling Brocken for thousand places my partner having swelled ribcage and limping legs. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]Allah know after how much time when mind got its memories back and I started recognizing three others around, I lit a cigarette without having any talk. I felt others are also having similar condition so my acting will not work anymore so I turned towards my brother and asked &#8220;Aye Ki keeta Jey Bhai Jan&#8221; what you have done with us. All started looking at him.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]He was also rubbing his knees smiled &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. He is my elder brother and our mentor and there was many other religious and blood relations restriction on me to stop retaliating about such smile. Anyhow, we controlled ourself and gazed at him. He said look at your left (Where we had left track and jeep was turned towards right side and fell in a soggy field) we instantly turned our faces towards right but nothing understandable. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]He took us back to track again and walked ahead maximum 10 steps. My goodness, that was the river bank were we were standing and this track end right into the deep river water. We were stunned stupefied in a swoon, for several minutes we were kept silent. Finally, I asked how u guessed we are heading towards river. He replied while chasing boar on track suddenly I got a shade of water ahead and whatever happened is the spontaneous reaction.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri]We had forgotten our wounds and thanked ALLAH that he saved our lives that day. We find big blood spots while travelling back but the beast managed to jump into the river and hopefully never get out of it.[/FONT]', ''),

With several variations of the RSA in the market today, GLOCK&#8217;s goal with this voluntary exchange is to standardize the RSA to gain the best possible performance in each pistol.\n\nGLOCK&#8217;s product development team has modified various elements of the RSA. The new RSA compensates for all design modifications made to the Gen4 and allows the pistols to function up to GLOCK&#8217;s rigid quality standards and reliability goals.\n\nConsumers should note that Gen4 G26 and G27 models will not require a modified recoil spring.\n\n&#8220;We are moving proactively and quickly to standardize this part of the pistol. This is a voluntary exchange specifically for the new Gen4 models,&#8221; said Gary Fletcher Vice President GLOCK Inc. &#8220;We have developed a program for consumers to send in their existing recoil spring assemblies and receive new ones at no cost.&#8221;\n\nThe replacement of the Gen4 pistol RSA can be performed as part of the regular field-strip process; consumers do not need to take the Gen4 pistol to an armorer. Consumer&#8217;s wishing to participate in the exchange program are urged to call 1-877-745-8523 to order their new recoil spring.\n\nFor more information on the details and shipping requirements on the replacement program, visit [url]www.teamGLOCK.com[/url]', ''),

I''m posting here my own post in another thread, deeming it to be more in relevance to the question of the thread here:[/B]\n\n[QUOTE]Respected CJP is there to interpret the laws [COLOR="blue"]and we have a senate and a parliament to make or amend the laws.[/COLOR] Hence, if any limitation is to be amended to the number of licenses allowed, it has it''s own forum and law making processes to go through, not the operative area of the Supreme Court.\n\nI believe this was basically the "jack" needed to counter the Lahore writ.\n\nStill, the Lahore writ is fully pro-revalidation of licenses via Nadra, but just questions the viability of the card system and record keeping of ammo purchases, since they''ll will go unchecked, kind of, in that there''ll be no records on carried Nadra card on how much ammo a single purchaser has been able to avail. In addition to this it mainly questions the cancellation of licenses in the absence of a gazette notification. \n\n[COLOR="blue"][SIZE="5"]Law n'' order: [/SIZE][/COLOR]15 people here in Wah looted 8 shops of jewellers last night and the bullets from aerial firing landed close to my house. The episode took place around 7 pm. Couple of cars were snatched on the spot, and one guy received a bullet in the foot for resisting to give his motorbike. Plunder was about Rs. 4 crores. Such is the state of law and order, that no police in otherwise "security-packed" Wah managed reaching the spot in the heart of the city, with Police station being about 500 meters away only.\n\nWould you be bound to move homewards to collect the "single allowed" pump-action back home for your safety, or should you be allowed to secure yourself with another CC weapon?\n\nEven as for personal security - requirements for which respected CJ seems to be consenting - different sets of weapons are required for different situations. You can''t be expected to be moving around with a longer barreled only, if that particular 1 weapon happens to be your single allowed one for protection.\n\nSame goes for hunting sports. Would they ban hunting as a whole or would you be bound to shoot your occasional dove and big game and everything that comes in between with the "single allowed" .22, i.e ????????!!!!!!\n\nCome on guyz, just get ready for the re-validation, these remarks by respected CJP seem more to be the "green signal" required for that process by the Gop, and a reflection of honorable CJP''s mindset for the serious situation in Karachi.\n\nI''d agree, however, with the present set up in the regime for longer than needed, the "single iron theory" could be one agenda, regret-ably by the same set up which first went liberal for quite the opposite.\n\n\nRegards.\n\n[/QUOTE]', ''),

My humble advice would be: Just practice on labair (Russian dove) and wild pigeons (salara) if they are legally open to shoot ... "pre season". And second, lead from the duck''s beak and not from body (alwayz keeping a ''sight picture'' of leading from the beak). Try this method: Do not calculate leads in feet or inches because you won''t be able to do that ever of course, imagine approximately DUCK LENGTHS or GOOSE LENGTHS from the bird''s BEAK...that will give you the best lead approximation and estimation in my view. Technically they say 2.5 mallard lengths at 40 yards at a 90 degrees crossing mallard (not quartering). But that is just an idea. Adjust that a bit at say 25 yards to 35 yards ... which is the nominal shooting range we get here over decoys. And thirdly, it really also depends on your shooting method: whether you are shooting the ''swing thru'' method or the ''sustained lead'' method or ''spot-shooting'' method. In swing thru style (which I normally do), the lead would be lesser, in the second one, it would be more. So its a complex qs you have asked. Best tip would be to first ascertain your style, get the lead going after the shot (i.e. follow thru) and then check approximately HOW MANY BIRD LENGTHS you need from the BEAK (and not the body). This is the method I use on geese hunting and I have found it to be just lethal, because the bird (goose) is a v deceptive bird in terms of flight and hence lead estimation. People very often underestimate the lead required sheer becoz of the bird size and apparently slow flight whereas the flight is pretty fast enough, close to a mallard''s speed if I am not mistaken.', ''),

In the haste and "heat of the moment", in any critical SD situation, your natural defensive reaction would be to just "draw n'' pull" the damn thing for a quick bang, no time to think about crappy, employed safeties to have deactivated first. Remember, we''re talking DEFENSE, where the benefit of surprise is already with the would-be assailant and to be overcome by you, hence no time playing around with safeties, so I can live without these, and would prefer a decocker instead, for the safe chambering of live rounds, perhaps on daily basis, and it is a great "safety" by itself to me and my surroundings.\n\nHence, safeties to me are more for stupids trying out the feel of my unattended gun, which I''d never leave unattended, anyways.

(352254, 'Cz75 p01 [I]Came across this, and thought would definitely add to  the CZ75 sum up, for those who are not much aware of what this weapon has been through, specially in our part of the world! \r\n[/I]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe P-01 is a NATO classified pistol and issued the NATO stock number NSN 1005-16-000-8619.\r\n\r\nThe CZ P-01 is the culmination of several years of exhaustive design and testing. Ceska Zbrojovka has always had some of the most rigorous testing requirements in the world but, the Czech National police has required that they go even further, the testing regiment for this new pistol was the most demanding anyone has ever encountered. There are almost 20 specific requirements covering everything from accuracy to interchangability, from safety to reliability/durability and everything in between.\r\n\r\nThe pistol: The CZ P-01 is a Gen 3 pistol that began as a requirement for a lightweight compact pistol that will deliver the accuracy and durability of a full size, full weight pistol. This was no small task, several manufacturers declined to even start the project.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you notice about this pistol is the M3 light rail on the frame, a first for CZ, the alloy frame is a little wider at the top than a steel CZ 75. This adds strength and rigidity for mounting the light and increasing the accuracy and service life of the pistol. The P-01 also sports enhanced controls as well as a drop free magazine and a lanyard loop.\r\n\r\n[U]The pistol was required to pass a wide variety of tests:[/U]\r\n\r\nThe police required that the pistol ensure the highest level of comfort, an extended slide release was added as well as an extended magazine release and the trigger was reshaped to give a more consistent pull throughout the trigger stroke.\r\n\r\nThe pistol must be 100% reliable in extreme conditions, the following is a list of some of the minimum requirements.\r\n\r\nMust be able to complete the following without failure:\r\n\r\n4000 dry firings \r\n3000 De-cockings\r\nOperator level disassembly 1350 times with out ware or damage to components.\r\nComplete disassembly 150 times, this is all the way down, pins, springs etc.\r\n100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U]Safety requirements:\r\n[/U]\r\n[U]Drop test\r\n[/U]1.5 meter (4.9'') drop test, this is done 54 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked. Dropping the pistol on the butt, the muzzle, back of the slide, sides of the gun, top of the slide, in essence, any angle that you could drop the gun from. This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.\r\n\r\n3meter drop (9.8'') 5 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked, This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.\r\n\r\nAfter these tests are complete the gun must fire without service.\r\n\r\nThe factory contracted an independent lab to do additional testing on guns that previously passed the drop tests. These pistol were dropped an additional 352 times without failure.\r\n\r\nThe pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test: \r\nThis means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud.\r\nThe pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at –35C (-36F).\r\nThe pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F)\r\nThe pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.\r\n\r\n[U]Service life:[/U]\r\nThe service life requirement from the Czech police was 15,000 rounds of +P ammo!\r\nThe pistol will exceed 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.\r\n\r\n[U]Reliability:[/U]\r\nThe reliability requirements for the P-01 pistol are 99.8%, that’s a .2% failure rate. \r\nThis equals 20 stoppages in 10,000 rounds or 500 “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) \r\nDuring testing, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired, this is a .05% failure rate, a MRBF rate of 2142 rounds! Over 4 time the minimum acceptable requirement.\r\nThe U.S. Army MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 grain Ball ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[U]Heritage:[/U]\r\nThe P-01 is based on the CZ 75, the most used pistol in the world. Over 60 countries use it as the standard side arm of their Armies, National police forces, National security agencies or other Law enforcement organizations. No other pistol can make this claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n[I]copied from pafoa.org[/I]\r\n\r\n\r\nPS\r\nThis weapon is also known as the CZ75D Compact...available at National Traders Lahore, and soon to be short supply.... :D', ''),

At other times you might have to shield someone, or carry something in your reaction hand. Sure you can rack the slide on your belt buckle, with your shoe or on any hard surface if you practice well, but it will take time.

(352346, 'The Beast &quot;HK Mark 23&quot; I bought the HK Mark 23 few months back but before I took it to the range a friend of mine liked it so much that he took it from me. Then I had to place an order again to get this beautiful beast. During my last trip home I heard the good news that my new beast has arrived and after custom clearance it will be ready to go along with me on my Green Book :) . Too bad that I got it home just before leaving back for abroad. No time to test fire and have fun at the range. But Inshahallah next time when home will take it to the range to have shooting fun it.\r\n\r\nA special thanks to Farhan Bhai of Majeed Sons who imported this beautiful beast for me as per the deal and the time frame. I have seen that he is the man of his words and keeps his promises and can import unique and most collectable items which no other dealer can arrange.\r\n\r\nThe MK23 is considered a match grade pistol, and is capable of making a 2-inch (51 mm) group at 50 yards (46 m). The MK23 has exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion-resistant. It uses a polygonal barrel design, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability. It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. \r\n\r\nThe HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns in .45 ACP. The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols.\r\n\r\nIn more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the handgun enthusiast’s requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!\r\nBasic Features of Mark 23:\r\n\r\n•	Threaded O-ring 5.87” barrel with polygonal bore profile\r\n•	Match grade trigger\r\n•	One piece machined steel slide\r\n•	Frame mounted decocking lever and separate ambidextrous safety lever\r\n•	Can be carried “cocked and locked” in single action mode with the safety lever on\r\n•	Patented HK recoil reduction system\r\n•	12 Round Magazine capacity\r\n•	Corrosion resistant blued finish\r\n•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame\r\n•	Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves\r\n•	Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories\r\n•	Ambidextrous magazine release lever\r\n•	Extended slide release\r\n•	Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator\r\n•	Patented Lock-Out Safety device.', ''),

(352430, ' A very professional and important discussion; kindly let us be cool and focus on the issue only.\nThe safety is a very controversial issue.\nSome guns have it on the pistols frame (where it belongs ) 1911 and CZs, others have it on the slide like the Beretta 92 and Tauras and many others.\nSlide mounted safeties do have issues with them, as Mr Faisji has pointed out very correctly one has to not only tilt the gun to the right out of alignment but also shift it in the hand spoiling the grip in order to manipulate the Safety. \nThe second problem is that if one rakes the slide in ANGER the slide mounted decocker or the safety also get gets worked ruining your day.\nNow the Frame Mounted Safeties are where they should be; there is the least bit of mis alignment and movement of the gun to remove the safety. These safeties are very functional and fool proof.\nNow comes the catch; Mr AK 47, Faisji, Stigma and Starfish and Ameer have indicated that a loaded and cocked gun is still like a grenade with the pin removed but the lever squeezed in a death grip.\nI admit I can never carry a loaded and cocked gun with the safety applied unless it has a 1911 type GripSafety. In case a gun has a safety but no grip safety 1911 type then I load a round in the chamber and lower the hammer slowly with the thumb while squeezing the trigger, in case of DA the gun is good as a Glock and in case of SA one will have to cock it which will take time and mis align the gun and spoil /delay the crucial first shot.\nEnter Glock. This is one gun which is the safest with a round in the chamber as it is not cocked fully till one pulls the trigger. Also it is fumble free you draw point and shoot.\nNow guns with DECOCKERS are a very good compromise, one loads and Decocks without fear of hammer slippage due to oily hands or while one is under the influence.\nThe only problem with the decocked DA guns is that there is a sea change in the grip, finger position and feel of the trigger on transition from DA to SA on the second shot. One MUST practice firing his DA gun with the first shot DA and one or two SA on Targets at least once a month otherwise one is not ready to go in harms way.\nTrigger_ happy78 and jawin I remain at  your service to answer any questions to explain my self better.\n Wolf hunter brother we have tactics in card games ,cricket ,hockey foot ball and while saving ones life one has to apply tactics the gun is like a racquet or a hockey stick or a bat.\nThank you all for a lively discussion after a long time.', ''),

Most 22LR shooters don''t get full potential of their 22LR rifles as they fail to try a variety of ammo to find the best rifle-ammo combination. They try one or two kinds of ammo and complain that the rifle is not accurate and put the rifle away. \n\nIf you are really interested in 22LR shooting, start collecting small amounts of different kinds of ammo. The more variety you can collect, the better. Whether you buy a new or used 22LR rifle, you will need this collection to determine which ammo will give you the best accuracy.\n\nI hope you find a 22LR bolt action rifle to your liking.

In the last decade or so manufacturers of handguns have caught on the polymer disease and have been passing it on to handgun shooters.\r\n\r\nI can forgive them in deploying  polymer/plastic for grips but not for the rest - which is the guts of gun itself. We have been lead to believe that the plastic guns are more durable. What is the proof? There is not long enough history to this claim. For all steel guns the proof in the past history. Take the 1911 .45 for example. Has anyone questioned the dependability and durability of this workhorse? No one. Can plastic guns provide this kind of proof? They can not - as there is none.\r\n\r\nPlastic handguns are a cheap alternative to the real McCoys. How about plastic triggers for the plastic hand guns that sell for a lot of money? What could be a bigger joke than this?\r\n\r\nThe key reason manufacturers use plastic is to cut manufacturing costs. True, they weigh less. For the same caliber gun that weighs less, you have more recoil than one made of steel - simple law of physics teaches us this fact of life. \r\n\r\nI am happy with all my handguns - all made out of solid steel. You are free to "play" with your plastic handguns. \r\n\r\nI rest my case in defense of solid steel hand guns.', ''),

(352754, '22LR Bullet Energy Table - It Is Free I have prepared a 22LR bullet energy table for my own use. Included in this table are bullet energy data covering bullet weights ranging from 31 grain to 40 grains in 1-grain increments and bullet velocities ranging from 500 feet per second to 1,700 feet per second in 50 feet/second increments. Energies listed are in foot-pounds. \r\n\r\nThis table can also be used for other cailbers and bullet weights. Here is an example. Let us say we need to find the bullet energy of a 200-grain bullet with bullet velocity of 3,000 feet/second.\r\n\r\nThe table lists 40-grain bullet with velocity of 1,500 feet per second as having 200 foot-pounds of energy. Bullet energy gain is proportional to the bullet weight gain. Since the 200-grain bullet is five times heavier (200/40=5) than the 40-grain bullet, we multiply 200 by 5  and come up with 1,000 foot-pounds of energy.\r\n\r\nDoubling the velocity of the bullet increases the bullet energy by a factor of 4. In this example we multiply 1,000 by 4 and come up with 4,000 as the bullet energy in foot-pounds of the 200-grain bullet with velocity of 3,000 feet per second.\r\n\r\nOther members may find this bullet energy table useful.', ''),

To me the only truly safety is the one between an operator''s ears. anything else (be it a safety or a decocker) are nothing more than switches and knobs that only offer a false sense of security/safety. however we do need them from time to time as they do one thing quiet superbly. that is, they provide us something to pin our stupidity/mistakes on. \r\n\r\nOOPS! IT WASN''T ME, IT WAS THE SAFETY THAT DIDN''T WORK. OOPS! I DIDN''T KNEW THERE WAS A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER. OOPS! I ACCIDENTALLY FORGOT TO TURN THE SAFETY OFF.\r\n\r\nsounds familiar? \r\n\r\nmoving on, I never carry a round in the chamber. never felt the need to. why? because in my humble opinion, it requires very little time in racking the slide and chambering the round so why carry a round in there in the first place. how many milliseconds we can save by taking this very dangerous route.\r\n\r\nsomeone might argue that even a single millisecond is more than enough to turn the tables around and change the outcome of a fight. well, In my humble opinion, that is nothing more than pure Hollywood talk. ever wonder why in movies the good guy always takes out his gun first and shoots two bad guys standing left and right and in slow motion?\r\n\r\nthe only time I can benefit from a firearm is when I can foresee or realize or recognize an imminent danger approaching. shorter than that, its pretty much pointless for me to even carry a gun let alone carry a loaded firearm. because there simply isn''t time to react. unless i''m in a Hollywood movie locked in a face-off with two bad guys and wearing a t-shirt with a punisher skull.\r\n\r\nso, where all that leaves me, well....the only time I find a decoker usefull is when I need to draw my weapon out, rack the slide, wait for the imminent danger to approach and leave, decock the weapon, remove the magazine, empty the chamber by racking the slide again.\r\n\r\nso for all practical purposes I only need a single action firearm with no safety/decocker of any kind whatsoever.

To me the only truly safety is the one between an operator''s ears. anything else (be it a safety or a decocker) are nothing more than switches and knobs that only offer a false sense of security/safety. however we do need them from time to time as they do one thing quiet superbly. that is, they provide us something to pin our stupidity/mistakes on. \n \nOOPS! IT WASN''T ME, IT WAS THE SAFETY THAT DIDN''T WORK. OOPS! I DIDN''T KNEW THERE WAS A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER. OOPS! I ACCIDENTALLY FORGOT TO TURN THE SAFETY OFF.\n \nsounds familiar? \n \nmoving on, I never carry a round in the chamber. never felt the need to. why? because in my humble opinion, it requires very little time in racking the slide and chambering the round so why carry a round in there in the first place. how many milliseconds we can save by taking this very dangerous route.\n \nsomeone might argue that even a single millisecond is more than enough to turn the tables around and change the outcome of a fight. well, In my humble opinion, that is nothing more than pure Hollywood talk. ever wonder why in movies the good guy always takes out his gun first and shoots two bad guys standing left and right and in slow motion?\n \nthe only time I can benefit from a firearm is when I can foresee or realize or recognize an imminent danger approaching. shorter than that, its pretty much pointless for me to even carry a gun let alone carry a loaded firearm. because there simply isn''t time to react. unless i''m in a Hollywood movie locked in a face-off with two bad guys and wearing a t-shirt with a punisher skull.\n \nso, where all that leaves me, well....the only time I find a decoker usefull is when I need to draw my weapon out, rack the slide, wait for the imminent danger to approach and leave, decock the weapon, remove the magazine, empty the chamber by racking the slide again.\n \nso for all practical purposes I only need a single action firearm with no safety/decocker of any kind whatsoever. I do need all the bells and whistles (SA/DA, decocker, safety) to show them off to my friends however.\n \nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n \nI guess old age is catchin'' up I do not remember when or even if I ever did see a Single Action pistol without safety except Serious Target pistols. The Single Action reveolvers are without safety though.\nThe Glock''s unique safe action is the best for SD , CC.\nFollowed  by double action pistols with safeties, or decockers in my humble opinion. \nMIT s point is very correct a pin block is a must on CC guns.', ''),

Was travalling in a car with two bodygaurds , one carrying a PB rifle and other carring a 12G shotgun; both guns were [B]Not Loaded[/B]. Subject was on driving seat ,one gaurd on front seat and one at the back.\nThey were travelling on a [I]Single[/I]-track [I]road[/I] near a Industrial Area in Lahore District. The road was Bumpy and under construction. There was a carriage Van ahead of them travelling at a speed of 10 km/h. The van ulitmately stoped due to the road condition and [B]Three Robbers[/B] appeared with [B]Pistols[/B] in their hands. Two of them went towards the Van and pulled the van driver out  and one Robber came back towards the Subject''s car from the left side. In a Flash of time the robber realised that his Clients are carring guns and started firing while running away , as in the mean while, Subjects Gaurds were loading their guns in panic. One Gaurd on the front seat was hit under his right shoulder. After fealing the heat of that hit that gaurd opened a brust on the front van where other two robbers were hiding forcing them two run away. In the same mode of time the Subject who was driving reversed, the car a bit, overtaked that van and ran to Saftey."\n\nAfter this story I also agree with [B]12Gaugue[/B] bro''s term but in another way that "[B] its pretty much pointless for me to even carry a gun[/B]"\n\nSometime[B] Carrying a Big gun can become a huge Risk for you [/B] as after carrying that it is hard for you to surrender.

(352851, 'PAKISTAN''S JIM CORBETT; all SENIOR &amp; JUNIOR hunters of PG must read it. @All friends; \n\nMy advise is for all senior and junior hunters of this forum must read and know about real hunting heroes of your country.\n\nAlmost we are always getting inspire by foreigner hunters, I also experienced companies of many world class foreigner hunters in my life but I am inspired only from a hunter who belongs to my own great country.\n\nI found many similarities in his life and in the life of Jim Corbett especially survival at their early days of life and later on love with Wildlife. So, I called him Pakistan&#8217;s Jim Corbett, and no doubt he is.\n\nThe hunter&#8217;s name is "MR. SAFDAR JAVED CHEEMA SAHIB", \n\nI have the great honored to met him many times and I am lucky I spent good time in his company but time was too short I met him in 2001 but bad luck is he died 02 years ago due to heart attack. (Allah Tallah Unki magfirat farmaien aor unko jannat-ul-Firdos may jaga atta farmaen "Ameen")\nHe loved me like his sons; I learnt many things from Cheema Sahib, I spent good time at his home when ever I visited Lahore my first priority was to meet the legend. \n    \nMany senior hunter may already knows about him but I am sure they know very little, because Cheema Sahib was very down to earth man, he don&#8217;t like self exposures for nothing.\n                            \nMR.SAFDAR JAVED CHEEMA&#8217;S ACHIEVMENTS \n\nCheema Sahib was not only a hunter but he was also holding many professional achievements as following     \n                 \nAdvocate Lahore High Court, Lahore (M.A. Political Science, M.A. Punjabi L.L.B.)\nEx-Best Professional Hunter.\nEx-Game Warden, Punjab.\nEx-Commercial Pilot Civil Aviation, Pakistan.\nRadio, T.V. & U n (Play Back Singer, Awarded by "Lata Mangeshkar")\nSpecial Correspondent Daily "PAKISTAN" / Daily "SAHAFAT".\n\nWeeks or a month is less to watch his all collections about hunting including his photo albums. He handed over me his autobiography which was save with me as aprecious gift; and now same I am sharing here for best of my community&#8217;s knowledge.\nAt bellow I am posting the same autobiography without adding or deleting any single world.\n\n\nMR.SAFDAR JAVED CHEEMA SEARCHED OUT PIA&#8217;s CRASHED PLAIN AT NEPAL.\n\nFirst I like to share 02 missed things in autobiography, he was the close friend and hunting teacher of Mian Nawaz Sharif  Sahib (friendship was based purely upon hunting).\n\nCheema Sahib proved himself as a hero and true hunter, when he searched a PIA crashed plan on his feet \nIn 1992 &#8211; Pakistan International Airlines Flight 268, a Airbus A300-203, crashed into a mountain in Kathmandu, killing all 167 people on-board. \n\nAnd Safdar Javed Cheema Sahib was the first man who  provided solid information to Pakistan & Nepal Government with pictures about real crash story.  \nHe searched out on his feet and beard all rescue expenses from his pocket. \n\nBefore Cheema Sahib''s  solo rescue mission ,both governments were closed their rescue operation activities due to failure in search of crashed plan in depth of the high mountains of Nepal. \n\nAfter these news Mr.Safdar Javed Cheema Sahib took first step towards recues mission with skills of hunter. \nSo, he practiced his hunting skills and found the said plain in the mountains of Nepal.\n\n\nAUTOBIOGRAPHY "MR. SAFDAR JAVED CHEEMA"  (Dated-June-2003)\n\nI was born in 1941 without a silver spoon in my mouth rather with a thorny bush in my soul and psychology. My father was an eminent advocate from Sargodha and my mother was a second year student of M.B.B.S. at the time of their marriage, as far as my memory says, my mother and father had a separation (not divorced) due to personal conflicts, not known to me.\n\n So my mother was dictated to be a bread winner also in addition to her tough studies, with the result that I, myself had to adopt the practical ways and means to meet my days for my future life, right from my childhood. \nSo I was engaged in the profession as a tutor of 4he children of lesser age than mine i.e. when I was r ass sixth, I was teaching the children students of class three to meet my basic needs of life.\n\nAt the same time, a "singer" was also born with me, so instinctively 1 :was inclined towards "singing" and I also used my above said talent for bread winning by virtue of singing on the Radio, T.V. & as a film playback singer\n\nAnd at the same time I was a born "Game Hunter" within myself, so through some body I managed to have catapult. Being a medical student, my mother was living around King Edward Medical College / Mayo Hospital and I also used to join her in her practical held at different medical wards with different patients. \n\nI was offered a contract to provide the rock / jungle pigeons for the patients facing the disease of paralysis against &#8220;Four Annas&#8221; per pigeon which was enough for him in those cheaper days. Here he used his catapult to drop down the pigeons in a large number from different buildings of the different areas of Lahore city and around the city.\n                        \nI employed myself with a gentleman as his assistant who possessed a .22 rifle and who used to take me out with him with the said rifle and I used to fire five shots per week with the said rifle on different targets. \n\nThis practice added to my accuracy, and as a result, I was declared as the best firer in my school time in the competition amongst three schools i.e. Central Model School, Saint Anthony School & Atchison College Lahore in the target shooting.\nGen. Muhammad Azam was the Chief Guest in 1957 at the dispersal of trophy ceremony in Central Model School and I was very much appreciated by the said Chief Guest.\n\n I requested him to get me a license for 0.12 bore shot gun in that tender age, as a prize for me the request was fulfilled at that time and I was issued a 0.12 bore license, I, again managed / maneuvered to purchase a shot gun for my use. The said shot gun, "emotionally" attained a status of my beloved.\n\nThen started his gun shooting, as a boy with partridges, ducks and other game birds. Simultaneously I converted myself on the big game also and stared with the shooting of "WILD BOARS". \nIn those good days the agriculture department of this country used to award R.s.7S/- to the hunter against per tail of the wild boar, as an award as the wild boars had been always injurious to the vegetation and crops.\n\nAt the same time, one Mr. Cricklivie was the curator then of Lahore Zoo, who was interested in buying the said wild boars against Rs.100/- per wild boar, I started to supply the wild boars to the said gentleman through a Christian assistant friend whom I had employed with me for the purpose of harvesting.\n\nI became a so called rich man with the said assignment and I now possessed a military model motorcycle, a military model jeep and a good combination of gun and, he opted commercial flying as his career and qualified his C.P.L in 1963, than diverted myself towards legal profession in 1973 till today.\n\nReferring my own country i.e. Pakistan I harvested the Ibexes & Markhor trophies and shot the leopards, sloth bears in the northern area like Gilgit, Chitral, Kaghan etc etc. I also shot the Panthers from the lower hills of Jehlum, Tarragi and Pubby Hills which was quite rich in the bird life also. \nI enjoyed the shooting of Chinkaras, Bustards and great Indian Bustards in the desert of Choolistan, the said areas are still very rich in wild life, along with the above said shooting I kept myself busy in the duck shooting also, almost in every part of my country, along with other migratory birds. \n                    \nWhen I was student of third year, I had an invitation to have a shoot of royal Bengal Tiger in the jungle of "SunderBun" in then East Pakistan in 1961. In this assignment I shot a Sunder Bun Man Eater Tiger with the said shot gun and the rifle.\n\nAfter the said experience I succeeded to have a permit to shoot in the Corbett Park (India), which was absolutely anew and wonderful experience, particularly with the background of the classic books, written by him.\n\nMr. Jim Corbett, he somehow or the other managed to have d big game in the South India also, where I shot a few leopards and sloth bears from the citations, referred by Mr. Kenneth Enderson in his books, again a renowned big game hunter in India. \n\nI have a rich experience of having the big game in Nepal around Katmandu in the valleys of Himalayas. After the said experience I was honored by the then Chief Minister Punjab to be appointed as Game Warden Punjab,\nwhich I substantiated for three years i.e. in spite of the fact that basically I was a game shooter.\n\nI worked for the sake of protection of wild life, of course in the opposite direction, using all my skill and knowledge about wild life and hunting on a different angle for which I was awarded with so many honors and colors by the Govt. of Punjab regarding the protection of wild life.\n                               \nEven now, although I am a heart patient, I go out for shooting to different spots i.e. within the existing legal limitations regarding protection and conservation of wildlife by the Govt. of Punjab, my sons &#8220;Gulrez Cheema&#8221; & &#8220;Gulzeb Cheema&#8221; have been trained to replaced me in the real sense and spirit.\n\nI found my country as one of the richest habitat" with the reference of existing wild life, in every corner and in ever respect throughout Pakistan.\n*******************************\n\nFEW PICTURES\n\n[IMG]http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h355/Lion_Lion_Lion/newfileeducationdepartment.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h355/Lion_Lion_Lion/newfileeducationdepartment005.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h355/Lion_Lion_Lion/newfileeducationdepartment001.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h355/Lion_Lion_Lion/newfileeducationdepartment002.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h355/Lion_Lion_Lion/newfileeducationdepartment006.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h355/Lion_Lion_Lion/newfileeducationdepartment004.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nBellow mentioned picture is captured from a presentation boot at one Hunting & Wildlife Exhibition held at Lahore (organized by Safdar Javed Cheema Sahib).  Cheema Sahib donated all his stuffs to Punjab Wildlife Department for more displays at next exhibitions for Wildlife and hunting lovers and  for public awareness. \n\nBut at the last PWLD behaved according to their history. PWLD didn''t arrange event further and lost and sold all stuff donated by Cheema Sahib.\nMost important is Cheema Sahib was owners of 03 houses at  posh areas of Lahore, but time by time he sold 02 houses to bear the expenses of PWLD projects and for the wildlife and hunting promotional activities. \n\nI salute to him  because he didn&#8217;t  owned or received any reward/award /lease/ land/ farm house or any kind of benefit by Punjab Government. \nHe never asked for any kind of permit/license/loan or jobs for himself or for his sons; even he was very fast  an good friend of Mian Nawaz Sharif Sahib. But he told me the story about a event when he gave gift to Mian Sahib. \n\nAhh &#8216;&#8230;badluck is nowadays real and so called hunters; both are joining companies or shaking hands with leaders & politicians only for their own benefits but not for Wildlife & hunting communities, we have many examples in the near past.\n\n[IMG]http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h355/Lion_Lion_Lion/newfileeducationdepartment003.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

We were invited to join them in Shakargarh on the banks of Daik Nula, we joined them on hunting night (we were told that it was a boar hunt) I took my new rifle and left shotgun at home.\nWe started jeeping in the night and at a place we didnot have a bleak idea about, didnot find any boar but there were many rabbits running in front of our jeep''s head lights (yes, we didnot have any moving light but the head light and fixed fog lights ;) ). We decide to go for rabbits.... I started shooting them with 7mm from very fast running jeep ALL BAD SHOTS ;) even the host shikarees tried their shotguns on many of the rabbits but every shot went in the ground without even touching any animal.... this kept on going for more than 1 hour till the friend who was on his new jeeps trial asked us " if you dont fire on next rabbit I will fetch you at least one rabbit to take home".. so we did that and kept our cool when next rabbit was sighted..... and that rabbit was hunted without firing a single shot....... HOW; our brave driver/hunter just chased him for 400-500 yards and hunted it by just hitting him with his jeep :clap2: and mind you it was a cleaner kill than any of the shotgun kill (not crush) :peace: we came home proudly with [B]one big TROPHY[/B] but sadly the Shakargarh hunting party never invited us again :(', ''),

(353056, 'MOA - Is It Greek? Your friend tells you that his rifle shoots one MOA. Is your friend speaking Greek? No, he is speaking the language of hunters and shooters.\n \nYour friend is telling you that his rifle has an accuracy of one inch at 100 yards. MOA refers to Minute Of Angle. We know that a circle has 360 degrees. One degree has 60 minutes. Take two staright lines that start at one point and open up with an angle of 1/60 degree or one minute of arc. As the distance from the starting point gets farther, the distance between the two lines becomes larger. At a distance of 100 yards from the starting point, the two lines will be one inch apart from each other. Actually the distance is a bit larger than one inch. It is about 1.047 inch. Commonly it is referred to as one inch.\n \nRifle scope and peep sight manufacturers usually graduate their equipment for elevation and windage in fractional increments of MOA - usually 1/4 minute (but not always). A change of one click/mark on a scope or peep sight will translate into a change of 1/4 inch at a distance of 100 yrds.\n \nFor scope and peep sights graduated in 1/4 minutes, use the following to determine the change of impact point for the distance given for one click/mark on scope or peep sight. Also shown is the number of clicks/marks required to move impact point by one inch.\n \n25 Yards - 1/16 inch. One inch = 16 clicks/marks\n50 Yards - 1/8 inch. One inch = 8 clicks/marks\n75 Yards - 3/16 inch. One inch = 6 clicks/marks\n100 Yards - 1/4 inch. Once inch = 4 clicks/marks\n150 Yards - 3/8 inch. One inch = 3 clicks/marks\n200 Yards - 1/2 inch.

(355541, ' Salams Achilles, great to hear from you again. Hope all is well. \n\nI respectfully disagree. The Colt Commander is a fine gun but no where near the class of the DW Valor. I''m surprised you bought a series 80 for 230 k ?? Please correct me but I thought the Series 80 stopped production in the early 90''s ? If that''s the case then I assume your gun was also not brand new. \n\nA brand new Colt Lightweight Commander costs under $ 800 while a DW Valor sells for around $ 1500. Also the ones that we have on the forum here are the ones with the Ceramic coating which costs 350-400 extra so these guns end up costing $ 1800-1900 retail ! \n\nI think you''re probably comparing the entry level models of DW or even the Pointman series to the Colt which sell for around 800 and might be a fair comparison.  \n\n@Usman Great to see you on the forums !

That''s not possible to keep maintain the lead of 1 feet or 2 feet for different flying patterns.\n\nBut the Natural swing will give you best result if you have been studied to the weapon in your hand before any shoot,, for example, \n\nSelection of cartridge number for specific bird, \nTest patterns of your desired cartridges with choke and cylinder,\nStudy about the behavior of flying patterns of game birds,\nPattern of your shooting suite/vast which you like to wear at the shooting time. \n\nI think all these elements are involve in your poor or good flying shooting results.[/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nnicely explained ... very well TR\n\nand yes lead rule is specific with bird, shot size, distance and choke.

(353417, ' @Avais bro, i am not contradicting the lead aspect, i second your opinion about lead. Swing action cover the lead by itself actually and person behind the gun feels he has not given any lead. Actually he also led the bird while swinging his barrel. However, there are few style which are very common to throw the gun on the target and start swinging led according to height / distance / velocity / direction and bang. Some other way commonly used is calculated lead i.e. poking gun ahead of the target and then moving forward with same distance and pulling the trigger. \n\nAll are fine all depends upon the practice and easy for the shooter. I described my style which may be not as good as others are familiar with but since years i have gone through the same functionality i much feel easier. \n\nAs far as any field demonstration is concerned it always a healthy sign. you miss u learn. Keep learning and learning. No one is perfect in this universe. One bullet one bird is exceptional, however, 70% + is excellent in my theory.\n\nAs far as quails are concerned they are good as starter but take the hunt as game without competition amongst friends. Certainly one of teammate will be top scorer but it doesn''t means he is the best. he will be second or third another day. This is part of game and we just get intact with our passion.\n\nI heard long tales before reaching hunting grounds for labairs, but, i find it not that difficult because i was in practice over ducks which are also fast and swinging so results were not discouraging for me. however, i lost few birds because i started with 8# in a thundery evening but as soon as i shifted to lower numbers, i got the desired results. Anyhow, i still eager to hit this bird with number 8 in calm wind, let wait for another season then i will be in position to conclude.', ''),

(353485, ' The TT 7.62 bullet is .310 in dia\nThe 9mm is .355 in dia\nOnce a medium is hit with a bullet it is the rate of de-celeration which causes damage. The higher the rate of de-celleration, more damage is the result .\nThere are many variables but to simplify, it depends whether the bullet hits a soft spot or dense muscles and bone also whether the bullet is soft point or hollow point etc etc. An expanding bullet will rapidly lose its velocity causing maximum damage.\nThe 9mm bullets usually fired are from 90 gr to 147 gr, and are shot at velocities ranging from 1500 ft /sec to 1080 ft/sec where as the TT bullet is 86 gr at velocity of 1410 ft/sec.( military load which are used over here )\nThe 9mm has about 20 to 25 % more energy and is a more lethal cartridge than the TT round. Both 9mm and .30 rds over penetrate a human torso when FMJs are used ; how ever when soft points are used the 30 round lacks authority in comparison with the 9mm.\nThese days more stress is on anti terror activity by forces around the world so over penetration is avoided  and quicker incapacitating rounds get priority; hence the move over to larger calibers like the 9mm and 10mm, the .40 and the .45 ACP ( in the anti terror role the special forces use expanding bullets like Corbons, Glasers, and Black Talon or Golden Saber etc etc) as the Geneva convention does not apply to anti terror ops) The military have to use FMJs as per the Geneva convention in regular wars', ''),

(353562, ' [QUOTE=Prince;192164]@Avais bro, i am not contradicting the lead aspect, i second your opinion about lead. Swing action cover the lead by itself actually and person behind the gun feels he has not given any lead. Actually he also led the bird while swinging his barrel. However, there are few style which are very common to throw the gun on the target and start swinging led according to height / distance / velocity / direction and bang. Some other way commonly used is calculated lead i.e. poking gun ahead of the target and then moving forward with same distance and pulling the trigger. \r\n\r\nAll are fine all depends upon the practice and easy for the shooter. I described my style which may be not as good as others are familiar with but since years i have gone through the same functionality i much feel easier. \r\n\r\nAs far as any field demonstration is concerned it always a healthy sign. you miss u learn. Keep learning and learning. No one is perfect in this universe. One bullet one bird is exceptional, however, 70% + is excellent in my theory.\r\n\r\nAs far as quails are concerned they are good as starter but take the hunt as game without competition amongst friends. Certainly one of teammate will be top scorer but it doesn''t means he is the best. he will be second or third another day. This is part of game and we just get intact with our passion.\r\n\r\nI heard long tales before reaching hunting grounds for labairs, but, i find it not that difficult because i was in practice over ducks which are also fast and swinging so results were not discouraging for me. however, i lost few birds because i started with 8# in a thundery evening but as soon as i shifted to lower numbers, i got the desired results. Anyhow, i still eager to hit this bird with number 8 in calm wind, let wait for another season then i will be in position to conclude.[/QUOTE]\r\nSo in one or another way basic rules are the same.', ''),

(353580, '30/30 - Rifle Caliber or Something Else? The 30/30 is not a rifle caliber, but 30-30 is. The 30/30 is rifle scope reticle (cross-hair) type that is available from many manufacturers. The 30/30 offers the ability to estimate the distance to target. The 30/30 reticle represents a target of 30 inches in size (height or width) at a distance of 100 yards with scope power set at four. The fine cross-hair is the portion of the reticle used for distance estimation.\n \nFor the 30/30 reticle scope, I have computed and prepared a distance table for target sizes of 6, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24 and 30 inches and scope powers of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Distances given in the table are in yards. Accuracy of the distance in the field will depend on judging the target size.\n \nLet us say your target covers the full length (height or width) of the fine-line cross-hair with scope power set at 4X. This represents a distance of 50 yards.\n \nYou see a 12-inch tall rabbit through your rifle scope. The rabbit''s body covers 1/2 of the fine-line cross-hair with scope power set at 5X. The rabbit is at a distance of 64 yards.\n \nYou see a 18-inch tall coyote through your scope. His height covers 1/4 of the reticle with scope power set at 7X. The coyote is at a distance of 136 yards.\n \nOnce the distance to target is known, you can make any needed aiming adjustment based on your ammunition ballistics and your rifle zero-set distance.\n \nThe original file was too big to upload - I had to "shrink" it.', ''),

(353664, 'Mil-Dot? - How Different From MOA? Many rifle scopes offer mil-dot markings. The mil-dot is a abbreviation of milliradians (mills), 1/1,000 of one radians. Radian is a unit of measuring an angle. There are 2pie radians in a circle. Pie is a math constant - approximately 3.141593. A circle has 2X3.141593 = 6.283185 radians or 6,283.185 milliradians. This an awkward number to manipulate in doing math calculations. Depending on where you are, the number of mills in a circle may be rounded to 6,400, 6,300 or 6,000. \n\nWe know there are 360 degrees in a circle and 60 minutes in one degree. A circle has 21,600 (360X60) minutes. Some scopes are graduated in mills with a circle having 6,000 mills. Such scopes will have one mill equivalent to 21,600/6,000 = 3.6 minutes of angle or 3.6 MOA.\n\nIf we draw two straight lines that originate from one point and open up by an angle of one mill (3.6 minutes of angle or 3.6/60 of one degree), the distance between the two lines at a distance of 1,000 yards will be one yard and at a distance of 1,000 meters the distance between the two lines will be one meter. Because one mill is 1/1,000 of a unit, the ratio is easy to understand. \n\nFor our purpose of hunting let us look a distance we are familiar with. We learn from an earlier post ("MOA - Is It Greek" - my post of June 7, 2011) that one MOA at a distance of 100 yards is about one inch - closer to 1.047 inch. This is equivalent to 1/3.6 mills. A target that is one mill high represents 3.6 MOA or 3.6 inches at 360 yards.\n\nDo you want a scope graduated in Mil-Dot or MOA? Which is easier to use? You pick the one  that you are comfortable in using. Both give estimate of distance to target. In both cases you have to judge the size of the target in order to estimate the distance to target.', ''),

(353689, '22LR Hunting Challenge True sportsmen enjoy the challenge of a hunt. It is not good sportsmanship to kill a rabbit at 100 yards or more with a .30 caliber rifle. But, it is to do it with a 22LR.\n\nSmall game long-distance hunting with 22LR invites challenge that true sportsmen seek and enjoy. Bear in mind that some people hunt rabbits with air rifles that have pellet energy of about 20 foot-pounds at the muzzle. A 22LR delivers this amount of bullet energy at over 800 yards. For all practical purposes, a 22LR will kill a rabbit at any distance you can target. The point is - can you hit the target at that distance?\n\nThere are three keys to successful long-distance small game hunt. First, you have to know the ballistics of your ammunition. Second, you have to judge the distance to target. Third, you have to judge the size of the the target. All three keys are withing your reach. Let us discuss each key.\n\nIf you are using high velocity 22LR ammo with muzzle velocity of 1,255 feet per second and your rifle zero-set distance is 90 yards, your bullet will rise no more than 2.11 inches at 50 yards and fall no more than 2 inches at 105 yards. \n\nJudging distance to target without any measuring equipment is doable. Read my post of April 10, 2011 - "What is the Distance to Target? - You Have No Scope & No Measuring Device". Also read my post of April 24, 2011 - " Nothing in Your Hand - How Far is Your Friend Standing?" If you do have a scope, the task of estimating distance becomes easier. Rad my post of June 7, 2011 - "MOA - It It Greek?" and my post of June 11, 2011 - Mil-Dot? - How Different From MOA?"\n\nJudging size of the game animal will depend on your local conditions. You have to get to know the height of the animal in standing and sitting positions. Where I am, desert rabbits (jackrabbits) while sitting on hind legs are 15-18 inches tall with their ear perked up - listening for danger signals.', ''),

(353704, '22LR Rifle Suffer From Accuracy Sickness? Does your 22LR rifle suffer from accuracy sickness? Are your target groupings at 50 yards over 1/2 inch and at 100 yards over one inch?\r\n\r\nPoor accuracy could be due to you - the shooter, the ammunition you are using or the rifle itself. Poor accuracy could be due to combination of these factors. Have a friend try out your rifle with your ammo. If your friend can get better results, you need to hone your shooting skills. If his shooting results are similar to yours, then you need to proceed to the next step - the ammunition.\r\n\r\nUnlike center fire ammunition, 22LR ammo can not be custom loaded to achieve accuracy. The only option is to try different ammunition. Get your hands on as many different kinds of ammo as you can. Try them all out. Don''t be surprised to find if some cheap ammo delivers better results than expensive target ammo. It is just the nature of 22LR caliber that you need to tune your rifle-ammo combo to achieve maximum accuracy.\r\n\r\nLast, your rifle may be faulty or in need of service. Is the bore clean? Is the chamber clean? Is the crown of the barrel damaged or worn? Check it under magnifying glass. You should see edges of the lands and groves of the bore clean and sharp. If not, have it re-crowned by a qualified gunsmith. \r\n\r\nA 22LR rifle that "behaves" badly can be brought inline. It takes some effort, but the results are rewarding.', ''),

May I add, 1.st shot always has a mentally shocking/ traumatizing and kind of pacifying effect upon the hit object, no matter where it lands on upper body, actual job is usuall done with the quick follow up SA shots, so never mind a partially stiffer 1.st shot, whether full DA, or half cocked.

I''ve got my minuscule collection of toys, i.e. 1 Steyer M9, 1 Diana 54, 1 Theoben Sirroco, 1 Gamo Shadow 1000. I''ve got 1 Hawke Sport HD scope 3 x 9 x 40 which I really enjoy using one the Theoben. I''ve got a Diana 1 piece scope mount on the way along with a Seben Camera mount...both of which were left at my bro''s house abroad for the last few months and none of us bothered to have them brought over. Now I''ve got my enthusiasm for the sport back and I''m having that stuff brought over asap along with some more stuff that I''ll order. \r\n\r\nI''m about to buy a BRNO .22, a Baikal Shotgun and another higher caliber hunting rifle which I will be seeking guidance on here. I have MOI licenses for the 9mm Steyer and the Shotgun, and Tayebally says they can get the MOI licenses for .22 and higher caliber (i.e. 7mm, 30-6, etc) within 15 days.  He''s asking for PKR 24,000 which I find obscenely high....so if anybody has any info on this, that would be great. I would like to practice sniping and do some small game hunting first before going for larger game. I need a couple of scopes, 1 for the Diana 54, 1 for the BRNO .22 and maybe one more for the higher caliber rifle...but I may buy this later. I like the half mil dot reticles, but I''m not sure of the pros and cons of the various kinds. I prefer larger objective lens (i.e. 50mm) bcs it provides a clearer picture and makes it easier for me find targets in the bush or low light conditions. I''d like to get myself some sort of range finder as well so I can practice sniping properly....I am totally uninformed on this subject so input from experienced shooters would be appreciated. Do I need a laser bore sight as well? I''ll get myself a tripod or two for the various rifles. \r\n\r\nSo here are the things I need input on:\r\n\r\n1. Which (long range sniping) scope to buy for .22 BRNO. Also, which scope mount and accessories do I need along with this? My budget is up to USD 500\r\n2. What type of range finder do I need? Budget is up to USD 400\r\n3. Do I need a laser bore sight?\r\n4. Where can I get an MOI license for a reasonable price? And, if not, what is the experience of other PG people with Tayebally in this regard?\r\n5. Although this isn''t the proper forum for it, which larger caliber hunting/sniping rifle should I plan for in the near future?\r\n6. What is the experience of other PG people with respect to tripods on the BRNO .22?\r\n7. What other accessories should I buy to make my sniping/hunting a little more fun/accurate/whatever?', ''),

( get a leupold VX-III scope for the initial rifle which will cost around $ 450 ) and it will also do a great job on bigger caliber rifles that you will aquire later.\r\n\r\n6) It is better to get a bi-pod for the 22 rifle. It will make your shooting more accurate and fun.\r\n\r\n7) There are endless accessories to make shooting/hunting more fun.Try to acquire a good set of binoculars. Get started with the above first and add the accessories later.', ''),

They slowed down in front of your car, you honk them to get the way but they stopped the bikes almost 14 ft from your car and naturally you hit the brakes to stop as well. Now both the pillion riders turn their heads towards you and that is the point your alarm goes on.

Hitting the pedal on the mettle and running them over:\r\n\r\nThe driver can do the above but there is a chance that the BGs will start firing and assuming that the dad riding the shotgun can not shoot so the risk is 50/50. The scenario would have been different if the dad was driving and the shooter sitting on the next seat started shooting whilst the car is roaring towards them.....\r\n\r\n2. Reversing the car\r\n\r\nRemember that the car runs a bit slower in reverse gear as compared to forward gear so there might be a chance that the BGs will start chasing ...... or perhaps shooting\r\n\r\n3. Haulting the Car and allow them to loot:\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that in areas like Gaddap the dacoits are much more organized than street criminals and chances are that they are after much more than merely your cell phone and wallet...

(354239, '22LR - Minimizing &quot;Flyer&quot; Shots We all want our shots to count - hit the mark. We can test our rifle-ammo combination for accuracy by shooting at a target. In such testing, we may notice that some shots land out of the main group on our target. We call such shots as "flyers".\n \nHow can we minimize such flyers? One way is to "control" our ammunition. Since 22LR ammo can not be custom loaded, all we can do it to try different types of ammo to minimize the number of flyers we encounter. Another way is to sort ammo by weight. Granted, we do not know if weight variation is due to the bullet weight or the propellant (power) weight. Regardless, we want weights of the loaded cartridges to be consistent.\n \nI have personally weighed thousand of 22LR cartridges and taken account of the weight variations. Cartridges that weighed at the extreme ends - either very high or very low were physically taken apart. This was done to check if the weight variations was due to the bullet or the propellent. My findings were in almost all cases, the weight variations were due the weight of the bullet. Bullet weight variations can lead to variation in bullet velocity This in turn can lead to change in the impact point of the bullet, thus resulting in flyers.\n \nWe can help minimize number of flyers by sorting our ammo by weight. I have done this exercise in increments of 0.1 grain. You can use a small scale like the jewelers/goldsmiths use for sorting your cartridges by weight.', ''),
(354240, ' [QUOTE=Furrukh;192957]I hate such scenarios bro !!!!! Before I start commenting please allow me to vent my frustration. These bastards take advantage of the fact we are driving with our families, if I could run into a BG with his family then all hell will run loose. I recently got robbed but my wife was with me so I sat like a desperate / helpless man waiting to be forgiven for earning a decent living.\r\n\r\nNow the anger is out of the way, lets analyse all our options:\r\n\r\n1. Hitting the pedal on the mettle and running them over:\r\n\r\nThe driver can do the above but there is a chance that the BGs will start firing and assuming that the dad riding the shotgun can not shoot so the risk is 50/50. The scenario would have been different if the dad was driving and the shooter sitting on the next seat started shooting whilst the car is roaring towards them.....\r\n\r\n2. Reversing the car\r\n\r\nRemember that the car runs a bit slower in reverse gear as compared to forward gear so there might be a chance that the BGs will start chasing ...... or perhaps shooting\r\n\r\n3. Haulting the Car and allow them to loot:\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that in areas like Gaddap the dacoits are much more organized than street criminals and chances are that they are after much more than merely your cell phone and wallet... In worst case scenarios there is a possibility of kidnapping for ransom or car snatching etc\r\n\r\nI personally would not prefer shooting in a situation of 1 vs. 4 with a semi automatic. Idealistic situation would be an automatic glock.\r\n\r\nWhat would I have done ? Recite Ayat ul Kursi and give them the valuables but would tuck in the gun in my jeans in case if the situation of a kidnapping arises...[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nI humbly did not  know about the background or whereabouts of "Gaddap"! So we''re talking about "toughened" goons of the roads, with experience not only in road blockades, but also in dealing with armed backfire, right? And kidnapping for ransom likelihood as well? +1 Farrukh, the "drive through" option involves risk of fire, even vehicle stalking. Too dangerous. But I''d still say, the old man at the steering wheel remains my issue . An active person can still reverse the car fast enough, while the back seat guy, with both hands free, can engage the guyz with fire and delay their move forward and manage creating a safe distance. BUT, it requires some intelligent syncronization of thoughts between the guy driving and the back seat guy with the gun, kind of asking for too much "luck" here. I have a feeling this was either a very narrow escape, if the guy with the gun really went mad and managed frigtening them off somehow, or, what''s seems more likely to have happended, a plain surrender. I''d still stick to the shoot n'' reverse theory, but it requires of the old man, quite some action. Omkhan bro, how abt declaring a couple of cards? Regards.', ''),

Two motorcycles are in the way and from what I''ve heard, they''re well built and strong and can easily cause a car to damage. I wouldn''t want my only option at escaping FAR away from the scene of hostility becoming a dead weight with my car''s engine/wheels/lights smashed out. \n\n2. As soon as I see random ''people'' in the middle of buttfudge nowhere, I''d go in a state of high alert. Would ask my wife and child to duck in the foot rest area while the same would be applied to the elderly sitting in front. There''s enough room in the leg rest to duck and cover. Note; ANY random bikes/people in the middle of the road, 100-50 meters away from me and I''m stopping and carrying out with step 2 and 3. If they come out of nowhere like this situation, I''ll try my level best to follow step 3 as fast as I can while making sure the loved ones are behind at least SOME cover. \n\n3. You see motorcycles coming in the middle of the road TOWARDS you, hit the breaks, turn the floodlights on (Follow point # 2) step out of the vehicle while drawing and aiming at the perpetrators and try my level best to remain calm and silent. \n\n4. If I''m in the middle of a place known for kidnapping and murders, I''m not taking any chances with the lives of everyone that I hold dear to me. If the perpetrators see that I''m already ahead of them because I''m out of the car, have already drawn my weapon and now I''m simply aiming at them, waiting for them to react. Having a gun pointed right in your face can leave many ''Sultan Rahi''s'' piss their pants (Or so I''ve heard) and that is why I believe I''ll be calling the shots and not them. If they realize the gravity of the situation, they''d turn back. If they don''t and decide to take chances then well, I''m a second away from blasting away.

It depends on the "duct of clearance", however, and more importantly, the DISTANCE of REACTION, if the accelaration will have impact enough for a drive through. Hitting the bikes can make one of them go UNDER your car, or part of it, which will either cause stalking of your car, or at least act as speed breaker and you may end up right where the want you!  Forward drive is only if the duct is partially clear, no chances of "dragging" any of the bikes along with you. I remember a fat bulldog that once ran across the road and infront of me, heck it was dragged some 100 mtrs on the road, and I still couldn''t get it off, until I stopped the car and reversed out of it! Here, we''re talking solid steel of well built bikes. Otherwise, the route is a FORCEFUL REVERSE and either evade, or engage, if still pursued. Thanks Omkhan for clearing me up on the driver.

(354339, 'Bullet-Drop Compensating Rifle Scopes We buy a rifle scope to gain better resolution of the target. Due to the nature of ammunition ballistics and the law of gravity, we have to sight our scope for a certain fixed distance, we can call this the "zero-set" distance.\n\nBased on the ammunition being used, this zero-set distance may meet our shooting needs. However, if our target is too far or too near the zero-set distance, we may have to compensate by either a hold-over or hold-under (aim higher or aim lower at the target) or by adjusting the scope elevation knob to raise the point of impact or to lower it.\n\nLet us say we are using a 22LR rifle. Our ammunition is a 40-grain cartridge that delivers muzzle velocity of 1,255 feet per second. When the scope is sighted for a distance of 100 yards, the bullet reaches a height of 2.82 inches at 60 yards (see my post "22LR - High Velocity Ballistics Table - It Is Free" - May 31, 2011).  Now we want a zero-set distance of 50 yards. To adjust the scope to this distance we need to lower the elevation adjustment knob by 11 clicks/marks.\n\nWhen we reset the scope to zero-set distance of 50 yards, we counted 11 clicks/marks downward from the prior setting. Bullet drop compensating scopes have a knob for adjusting the distance to target. This knob is marked for distance in yards. The clicks/marks are missing between the distance markings. In this particular case, there are still 11 clicks/marks between the 100-yard and 50-yard distance settings - even though they do not appear on the bullet-drop compensating scope dial/knob that is calibrated in distance.  \n\nThere in nothing secret or complicated about bullet drop compensating scopes. Based on the ballistics of the ammunition in use, the shooter still has to judge the distance to target.', ''),

(354386, '22LR Field Hunting - Why You Missed Target? You are in the filed hunting with your 22LR rifle. You spot your game - you carefully aim and pull he trigger. You missed your target. Now, you wonder why?\n\nLet us analyze the circumstance/situation. We can take the "you" out of the "why" equation as your aim was good. This leads us to question the rifle, the ammunition or both.\n\nWas the rifle mishandled since you last tested it for the zero-set distance? Is it possible that the rifle sight (open iron sight or telescopic sight) got misaligned during transportation? Did you use the same ammo in hunting as you used in sighting the rifle?\n\nWhat was the zero-distance? You may be able to recall the distance for which you sighted your rifle. How far was the animal when you pulled the trigger? How did you estimate the distance to target? How good was your estimation of the distance?\n\nLet us assume that your scope-mounted rifle was sighter for 90-yard distance. You "kill-zone" for this game was about 1.5 inches. You could have missed hitting your target if your distance to target estimation was anywhere between 37 yards and 70 yards as the trajectory of the ammunition could have been out of the kill zone. Let us not forget the margin required to account for the accuracy tolerance of the rifle itself.\n\nIt is essential to know the ballistics of the ammunition you use. Ballistics of 22LR ammo are readily available. Either memorize them for the ammo you use or write them down on a "cheat sheet" with bullet drop data and carry the sheet with you in the field. \n\nAs to estimating distance to target - either acquire a rangefinder or a scope that avails you of range finding capability. Read my post of June 10, 2011 "30/30 - Rifle Caliber or Something Else?" for using one type of rifle scope for estimating distance. \n\nYou may wish to learn other techniques for estimating distance to target. Read my post of April 10, 2011 "What is the Distance to Target? - You Have No Scope & No Measuring Device". Also read my post of April 24, 2011 "Nothing in Your Hands - How Far is Your Friend Standing?"\n\nApplying the knowledge of ballistics and judging the distance to target are essential in a successful hunt.', ''),

(354452, '22LR - Why Buy One? Are you new to the sport of shooting and hunting? Are you interested in buying your first weapon? May I suggest that you first buy a 22LR (22 long rifle caliber) rifle. Later you can acquire other types of guns.\n \nSound reasoning for buying a 22LR rifle are many. Here are some. A 22LR will afford you a low-cost way of entering into this sport. Aditionally, with 22LR ammunition, you will be able to shoot and practice more than other brass cartridge ammo. The 22LR is ideal for hunting small game. The 22LR cartridge is the most popular ammunition in the world. This cartridge offers more bullet enery at 800 yards than an air rifle does at the muzzle - the front of the barrel.\n \nPurchase of a 22LR rifle is an investment. If purchased wisely and cared for properly, it will still be worth what you paid for - perhaps worth even more after five or ten years of use. with a 22LR rifle you can introduce others in the family and friends to this hobby.\n \nTake the right step - buy a 22LR rifle. You will enjoy a lifetime of fun.', ''),

(354500, ' Brother, \n\nAlthough decoys are not so expensive, their import becomes expensive due to volume based shipment, +taxes & +customs etc.\n\nI frequently buy stuff from Cabelas, Wing Supply, Optic Planet, Cherokee & other vendors from the US. But Cabelas add 45% of the invoice as shipping charges which becomes a lot of money. Plus if you import anything through courier, they''ll levy custom duty as per their prescribed list & invoice you accordingly ... whether the items are customable or not.  \n\nRecently I came across a private store called RC Store owned by gentlemen Bobby & Kim Cox. It''s a family business and I found them very honest, reliable & cooperative. Their prices are very competitive and the best privilege I got from them which you cant get from anywhere else is that if they don''t have any thing you want, they''ll buy it for you from other stores and include it in the order you''ve placed with them so this saves your expensive & repetitive shipping for small items which is a problem faced frequently because you find a few things at one store & the others at others store & you really don''t want to place orders for just petty items. So you just give them the product # of any item of your choice & the website address & they''ll buy it for you & upon receipt they''ll include it in their order & ship them to you. \n\nRegarding shipment, tell them to ship by ordinary US Air Mail. Your pack will arrive at GPO (inside Chaklala Garrison ) where you''ll have to go for its clearance. So far, I''ve never been charged customs for any of my hunting stuff by the custom team at this GPO. Last time I paid just Rs 40/= as some minor duty / service charge.\n\nThe address of RC Store is as follows\n\n[url]www.rchuntingstore.com[/url]\n605-426-6371\n[email]rrcox@valleytel.net[/email]\n\nRegarding decoys. I would suggest you to buy the Fusion series inflatable decoys from Cherokee .. they are light weight & compact when deflated. Go for the fusion series only because their upper portion, that is, neck & head is solid & fits on the shoulder which is solid also, whereas, the lower portion is inflatable. These are lightweight with compact volume & easy to carry and also inexpensive to ship across. Where most of the decoys are painted over a shell, these ones are actually photos of real ducks printed on inflatable plastic so they render a photo realism perspective which gives a far better quality than any other painted duck. I bought them after studying its good reviews & recommendations and since they are cheap, I didn''t mind taking the risk. The only draw back is they are booked till next season & you''ll have to wait. I placed order in December last year & I got them in February this year. Currently, since the duck season is off you might get all its editions. ... this shows this product is becoming quite popular. \n\nANOTHER USEFUL TIP : Instead of browsing through dozens of websites & shopping stores, you just type the name of your desired item in search box of this very useful site called [url]www.thefind.com[/url] and you''ll get hundreds of offers from dozens of stores. You then compare prices, choose the cheapest and note product # & while placing order at RC Store, you also request Bobby to fetch you this order also .... This will make your LIFE SIMPLE & EASY ! ... please don''t forget to mention my name to Bobby when placing orders. I got commitment from him that he''ll give discounts to all my PakGun Brothers !', ''),

(354565, 'HD/SD Shotgun with low recoil I am a new member and this is my first post.\n\nUp until April 2011 I knew nothing about guns and in fact was one of those who never wanted a gun in the house. That was until a gang of extortionists attacked my house in our village when (thankfully) we were out. Without getting into any of the details of the incident, just wanted to say that our lives changed from that point on.. the law and order situation in Pakistan is getting out of control (to say the least) and although owning guns will not solve the problem for us, one should at least be prepared for the worse of times. With the state failing to do its part to protect its citizens, if there ever is a life threatening situation and help is not around, it would be my responsibility to protect my family.\n\nA concerned relative arranged for me to get two licenses (9mm pistol and a 12g shotgun). I have already bought the 9mm pistol (stoeger cougar) and have had a chance to get training and tried it out myself. Although it was my first time with a handgun, but thanks to the countless hours of research and driven by a will to defend my family,  my friends thought that I was quite good with it. I can now manage to hit a 1 litre pet bottle at 20 yards and I might get better with more training. Cant say how I will do under panic situation, but hopefully I would never have to find that out. Cougar has been a good purchase though.\n \nAnyway coming back to the topic and the help that I require. \n\nI dont seem to have enough knowledge to make a decision regarding the 12g shotgun especially considering that I have a back issue and am worried about the recoil. Having gone through pakguns.com and other forums I understand that a better option for HD/SD is a pump action but then I have also seen youtube videos which show that pump actions kick a lot more than semi automatic gas operated shotguns. The recoil worries me because I might injure my back while training with it. However I have also come to know that although recoil is a relative thing, there are a number of factors which can reduce the recoil such as the type of cartridges (their load/fire power), type of stock etc. \n\nI can push my budget upto 100k or even 110k but ideally I would want to keep it around 75k. Could some one please guide what would be an appropriate option for me to buy considering the availability of brands/guns here in Lahore.\n\nI will be grateful for your suggestions.', ''),

(354568, ' [QUOTE=PakistanFirst;193197]See my June 13, 2011 post "22LR Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands". \n \nHigh-end ammo in match grade rifle was supposed to perform better than cheap ammo. The test results speak otherwise. Here are the findings at 50 yards. \n \nWestern Value Pack [cheap bulk pack] beat all these:\nLapua Master, Eley Pistol Match, Lapua Midas L, Lapua Master M, Eley Tenex Semi-Auto, Lapua Super Club, Eley Tenex, Lapua Standard Plus, Eley Standard, Eley Club Xtra, Eley Subsonic HP, Eley Club, Eley Sport, Eley Match Xtra Plus, Lapua Crow HP, Eley Silhouex and Eley High Velocity.[/QUOTE]\n \nIf and when two or more ammo types have to be compared then a a number of weapons of known accuracy are used for the trials. In case only only one ,rifle has to be used then it must be of known accuracy. Eley Ten X is being used in the Olympics in the three position Rifle Match the Prone match and numerous pistol events by almost 80 % of the shooters for the last 60 years the other being the Lapua Midas top grade with few users of RWS R 50. \nI have a number of .22 weapons, Anshutz Olympic Match Rifles and also plinking rifles like Browning and Brno No 2 , the pistols are Hammerli 280, Pardini RF, Walther GSP Expert , Ruger Mk3; and in each weapon The number one accuracy goes to Tenex EPS and Tenex , followed by Rifle and Pistol match and then RWS R50 I have not tried the Midas Olympic stuff yet.\nMy observations as a shooter are very acute as specially when one uses the ammo in an Olympic Rapid Fire pistol match; where one fires 5 shots in less than 4 seconds, the slightest difference in recoil or blast throws one completely out of time in that string. The same goes for the Timed series of the Standard Pistol Matches. I have encountered several problems with cheaper ammo in practice and never used other than match Grade ammo even for practice/training accept shooting vermin with my Pliking weapons.\nThe Three position Rifle matches are at 50 m and the ten ring is about 8mm and the scores of 60 shots are 600/600 in prone position decisions are made on number of x s scored ( X ring of 50m tgt is about4 mm)by the shooters and final shots where a very tough decimal system of scoring is adopted.\nTo surmise; the top end  match ammo is less accurate than the  ordinary plinking  ammo, which is atleast two to three times more expansive; without extensive testing and with proper  test parameters could be wanting.', ''),

Although Armtac does manufacture for verney carron this particular model is not mentioned in any of the verney carron sites.

(354699, '22LR - Costs Nothing but Could Improve Accuracy Center fire rifle shooters can custom load ammo to achieve peak accuracy. With 22LR, we are at a disadvantage - we can not custom load our ammo. All we can do it to try different type of ammo to get better results.\r\n\r\nWhen we pull the trigger, the propellant (powder) ignites and the bullet starts to move and it starts vibrations in the barrel. The idea is to minimize or eliminate these vibrations. Different techniques have been developed and tried. The easiest method is one that costs no money.\r\n\r\nFirst, fire five shot on your target. Now, try this. Loosen the front bolt that hold the stock and the barrel. Take a business card and insert it between the stock and the barrel - in front of the bolt. Now tighten the bolt - same as before. If after tightening the bolt you find that the business card is lose between the stock and the barrel, loosen the bolt and take out the card. Now fold the card in two, and again insert it and tighten the bolt with the same torque. You may have to try more than one card to get started.\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to do the testing. Fire five shots on a new target. Compare the first and the second target. See any improvement? You can repeat this process of inserting another card couple of times. No one can tell you if your results will improve or not. All you can do is to try this method.', ''),

I am also very found of PCP air rifles but unfortunately this particular air rifles are difficult to get. It seem that UK is the only easy available option of getting any PCP but according to my knowledge/search, pcp air rifles are much most expensive in UK specially those which has adjustable power option.  Before I was hoping/considering  Al-Sayad in Dubai but they don''t have PCPs and this was a bit of disappointment for me. \r\n\r\nAt this time I would like you to share with us your experience of buying/boarding your all this stuff including their prices?

Here is the reason. While I was in lahore, I got a contract offered to me for a few months in Denmark. The company wanted me within a few days after I had passed the interview etc. So I had to wrap up quickly and leave Lahore to go to Denmark. As you guys can imagine last 15 days have been absolutely busy for me and some nights I only slept 3/4 hours due to coming to Denmark. So I bought the flight and here I am writing this from Denmark now.so...\r\n\r\n@LionHeart bro:\r\nThanks. PCPs have always amazed me since the day i heard about such a gun.You are right UK is not the cheapest but then again, ther eis no such thing as perfect situation, you will probably have to give in on something one way or another. In the UK you will not have adjustable power above 12ft lb. As you need a fire arm licence (FAC) for those sort of powers. But just to give you an idea of what sort of power 12ft/lb is, I have shot rabbits from around 70 to 80 meters away which is a hell of a long way using my Theoben Rapid 7 taking a head shot. The pellet penetrated the head very happily too. The rabbit just flipped in the air and I knew instantly I have hit it. Anyways my 9 ft/lb springer is the most powerful springer I have shot in Pakistan. And I have always thought it had a lot of power (until I measured it before coming to Denmark)\r\nSo just saying that even 12ft/lb is pretty good too. A normal shooter can not hit a target in the rough open hunting situation anything more than a 100 yards. and a 12ft/lb rifle is easily enough for distances reaching that (or close to 80 yards or so) easily and accurately. Please remember that power alone is not enough. Accuracy of the rifle and the shooter, a steady hand, a lot practice and consistency is also as important as the power and may be even more. cos its not every time you need to hit something at 100 yards, but you need all the other factors every time though.\r\nRegarding the boarding stuff: This info that follows is gathered from a few online forums that I am a member of too. and people talk about their experiences going from a country to another etc. I brought my Webley Vulcan a few years back abd PIA made me run around a slight bit but at the end it was all fine. Now it only depends on the airline if they allow carrying weapons on the flight or not. there are some airlines which wont take any sort of weapon. So first of all you have to classify it and declare it as"sporting goods" as thats what it is. So never never say that its for hunting, just say you do "target shooting" and are going to participate in a competition IF someone asks, otherwise always put a label on the gun itself saying "Sporting equipment, disabled, unable to be used" atleast thats what I did. \r\nAs you know I have brougt two rifles this time around, a pcp pump, and a 15 litre cylinder all in one go. Thats because we had 90Kg allowance between us and i made a very good (full) use of that too.\r\nanyway, at Heathrow when I was checking in, I told the guy at the desk that I have a pellet gun in my luggage (I had two but I didnt want to sock him too much) just to see his reaction. The guys said that he needs to ask his supervisor. The supervisor was a lady (which I always try to avoid when checking in especially with this kinda stuff) and told me that she will call the manager and the manager will have to take me to the customs declaration officers. I said fine because I knew it is perfectly legal to take them. I had also dimantled them so took the barrel off, took the buddy bottle off, completely emptied the  buddy bottle of any air, then removed the valve, and then just left the valve hand tightened so any one can open and inspect it from inside too. anyways I had the parts of the two rifles spread in 3 different suit cases. The manager came and seemed quite a nice and reasonable Pakistani man (as the airline was PIA). he took me to the "CUSTOMS EXPORT" department. No one was there, so he phoned someone from the phones available there and asked them if someone could come and give an "all-clear" for my pellet guns. A few minutes later a gentle man came in uniform and asked me to open the case after asking me a few questions like what it is, what it fires etc. he didnt seem to know too much about the air rifles so I just answered his questions and then he asked me to take it out of the suit case. I did, and his mouth just stayed open when I took out the S16. It really does look like a serious bit of kit. First thing he asked me if this is a replica of a fire arm, i said no, it just looks this way itself. Told him to check it on the internet if he wishes for the name S16s and he will see the pics and specs etc. A few more questions and he asked me to put it back in the suit case. after he had finished completely, he asked me to wait. went inside his room, wrote something ona form and stamped and signed it and brought it out for me. The form said "Fire Arm Export Certificate", tag numbers of the bags,and the number of weapons etc. He seemed quite satisfied and so was I :)\r\nHe then called the airline manager and gave him the certificate. I had to pay £30 extra for "secure handling" of the suitcases to PIA as the cases had to be kept separate from the normal luggage until the plane is ready to fly so no one can get their hand s on them. But as they could charge per bag too, I was happy to just pay one time for the 3 bags otherwise I would have to pay £90. It was a kind manager I guess. I considered it to be £15 each gun, so not too bad.\r\nAnd then my checking in was complete. The guy gave me a receipt for the £30 payment and a spare copy of the certificate issued (even though I didnt need one) it was only for their records.\r\nThen I gotto Lahore airport (this was a direct flight which I also recommend if you or any one else is thinking of bringing something lie this because otherwise every one on the path will have something stupid to say about this stuff wherever this luggage is detected).\r\nAt Lahore airport our Pakistani rishwatti brothers jumped on every thing I had as almost all the suit cases had something they could detect in the scanners. But the worst one was the cylinder itself . when the guy saw it he jumped out of his chair with a long stick, and hit the bag and shouted whose bag is that? I had hired the porter for this,, Anyways, you can bring anything in Lahore as long as you throw the dogs a bone. Even though it is all legal stuff. Sorry to say this but it is shameful and unfortunate enough for our nation that they would offer their mother if you could show them a big enough bone :(\r\nAnyways, just to clarify I didnt put any thing related to the guns in the gun case you see in the picture. That was packed alone in brown cardboard totally empty. It was light and who ever touched it knew instantly that its empty and thats what I wanted too. The last thing you should do is to actually put the airgun in that case. Flying within Europe is fine and people do take them in these cases as they are flight approved and lockable too. but coming to Pak I wouldnt use that. Instead, break up the gun into pieces and then spread it around so it can not even be recognised or used as one. Anyway, no one even asked or even looked at the case as it went through the scanner as nothing was in it.\r\nyou just have to believe and know that it is all legal stuff and do everything properly. Dont think you are doing anything wrong cos u aint. Dont let any one tell u otherwise brother.\r\n\r\nRegarding your pellets, please send me a PM and I will let you know what to do. You will be through 200%. Just so you know, ,rifle scope and pellets are all legal to bring as far as the UK is concerned. Just DO NOT EVER bring them in your hand luggage otherwise they will be taken from you, and you may look like an idiot too.\r\n\r\nI think that just about covers your questions. Dont forget to PM me if you want to know and I will let you know how to deal with the dogs without a bone regarding the stuff u r bringing.\r\n\r\nSalaams.', ''),

WE ALL LOVE PAKISTAN and Pakistanis (as a nation, in general) are so patriotic that no other nation in the world can compete us in this passion, rather, obsession, however, we all have different ways to express it & we must respect all such various acts & means in which we exhibit our patriotism.\n\nMeanwhile, I followed your link & read your remarkable & very useful comments...  & I liked them so much ... that for the convenience of other readers I would like to copy & paste what you said under that link as follows ... and this is what actually happened in case of our brother who chose an unusual name like Bhooka Nanga and while choosing this name he actually had a great notion in his thought which he never conveyed to other people initially but when he did ... like you said ... his plain, rather, blunt array of words could not convey his true thoughts which motivated him to choose such a name and since his later explanation was not so well worded or if I may say (bluntly) ... he took it for granted that perhaps we all have the wits & common sense to understand what he actually meant made the whole situation confusing in the beginning and sooner ... than later, some of our brothers jumped to conclusions and awarded Mr. Bhooka with some indiscreet & harsh comments ...! for which I really felt sorry & I would like to accord my true sympathy to this poor gentleman .... I wish we all had read your teacher''s following lesson ! \n\n\nText under : [url]http://www.pakguns.com/showthread.ph...ht=#post187490[/url]\nOne of our communication Teachers taught us, mis-communication give rise to a number of misunderstandings especially the written one. I believe all of us including myself as a First Person, should pay a little more attention while writing some words any where as we cant see the face expression, body gestures and individual moods when we are not talking face to face, I try to observe every where about the above narrated fact and found it working. I know everyone here understand my words. What you people say.[/QUOTE]\n\nPakistanGuides : \n\n   I hereby thank you for listening and understanding my view point, that''s what required from all of us ( I being the first person ) in every field of life, and off course we all say and believe " Pakistan First ".\n\nWe people usually do not pay attention to above narrated fact about verbal or written communication, but as i said earlier i found it working. \n\nWe all walk in the woods, open areas, mountains and some times I call a person from FAR " either my call do not reach him or he is not able to understand what I have said ", again a barrier in verbal communication and what the barrier is " MAY BE WE ALL KNOW BUT DON''T OBSERVE ". There are a lot more examples, surly we will share some day.\n\n" To Accept Is To Understand "\n\nThanks Again.', ''),

You not only need to take into account the initial purchase price of the rifle, but also look at the ammo prices. No doubt, if you put the effort, you can find some good 22LRs at reasonable prices. Few days back Leopard reported here that he bought a bought a brand new CZ452 E-2 for 55K from a dealer. Look for a used one in good condition. It may cost half the price of a new one or even less.\r\n\r\nWhy not get in touch with Leopard who did lot of leg work to find his. I am sure he will be happy to share the information he gathered in his hunt for his 22LR. Also, beterra7 reported few days back that he bought a CZ model 2. You may want to check with him and learn from the information he gathered in his hunt for a 22LR.\r\n\r\nUsed 22LRs do not wear out. You can fire well over 100-200K cartridges before you even think of any wear in the barrel or the chamber. Improper bore cleaning is the worst enemy of a 22LR rifle. You can spread the word that you are looking to buy a 22LR. I bet there are many 22LRs just gathering dust for years. Don''t worry about the cosmetics of a used 22LR. Make sure that it functions properly and that the bore is good condition. \r\n\r\nYou have not mentioned if you are thinking of buying one, searching for one or have given up your search for one.', ''),

(354838, ' Review of the Weihrauch HW 100T FSB:\n\nI had been saving money for this the first day I saw It on the weihrauch website which also happend to be a week before I had told my Chacha to buy a HW80 which I also consider my gun as I use it the most and take care of it, after a year of saving up the money to get the HW100T I decided to do a bit of research and Airguns of Arizona had it listed for the lowest price at $1423.95 still a little on the pricy side but considering Im an avid air gunner , have always been and will continue to be one the price didn''t deter me plus I knew I would be getting weihrauch quality which is worth the price. Got the gun a week later and my first expressions of the gun were just as I had expected "Weihrauch quality" it came in a weihrauch cardboard box with form fitted Styrofoam with all the accessories in a cardboard box. The gun its self is really light lighter than my HW80 and seemed lighter then my competition walther lg 300. The stippling on the pistol grip is a bit rough not interms of quality though. Before I ordered the gun I called up Air guns of arizona to request the owner to send me the gun with the most beautiful stock  he advised me to go in for the walnut finish and i am thankful to him for shipping me what he had promised " pictures don''t do justice to the stock as it wasn''t too good of a camera. I also got 2 tins of H&N baracuda pellets with it which the owner of the shop advised me and got a FX 3 stage pump as well though I usually use the scuba tank to charge it up at my University''s shooting range. Ok so now lets get to the details of what comes with the gun in the box and some other stuff. \n\nin the box: air rifle , two 14 shot rotary magazines, air reservoir tank, pressure releasing tool, air charging adapter.\n\nI got the scope from Optics planet and Leupold mounts from Cabelas, hammond Indiana . \n\nfirst impressions of after shooting,,,,, Impressed !!! even though I was shooting from the 50yard line at our range with a full powers scope with no wind since its indoor the rifle was giving me single hole 10 shot groups at that range which I think does not test the full potential of the gun will need to move outdoors at a 100yard range to test the full potential. I have used H&N barracudas, crossman premier hollow points, JSB predators and ,RWS wad cutters in it and the first to give the best performance .\n\npros: just plain Weihrauch quality ! I have become a weihrauch buyer for life as long as they keep making air rifles the way they are now and Gamo does not buy the company. \n\nCons: I don''t know but its just a little too light to shoot accurately off hand not that its the guns fault but I personally just can''t keep it steady " considering I also shoot 10m competition air rifle and 50m .22 3 position on the university team" also the absence of sling mounting points does not help, I know that I can put sling attachments on it but I don''t want to do any thing to the stock. The safety is some thing weihrauch have to improve on in all their guns its non reversible in most of their guns but in this its just to hard but it is reversible. That''s all for now will be bringing back the gun to Pakistan In Dec hope to bag some bunnys and doves with it .', ''),

(354843, '22LR - Wind &amp; Bullet Drift The 22LR cartridge is a marvel. Due to light weight of the bullet, it is more prone to wind drift than heavier bullets. The speed of the wind and its direction will dictate where the bullet will land.\n \nWithout any instrumentation, how can we judge the speed of the wind? Over two centuries ago, admiral Beaufort devised a scale (Beaufort Scale) for measuring wind speed at sea. Later, his scale was adapted for use on land. The Beaufort Scale is based on describing the effect of the wind on objects. At approximately four to seven miles per hour, we feel the wind in the face and tree leaves rustle.\n \nWind to/from northeast and to/from northwest have the largest impact on bullet drift. At five miles per hour wind, a 22LR 40-grain high velocity bullet will drift just over an inch (1.06) at a distance of 70 yards and just under two inches (1.94) at 100 yards. By estimating wind speed, appropriate aiming adjustment can be made.', ''),

(354853, '22LR - Sharpen Shooting Skills The diminutive 22LR cartridge is full of amazement. Compared to other calibers, the cost of ammo is affordable - it will not break the bank account.\r\n\r\nThe 22LR is ideal for hunting small game. You should be familiar with the ballistics of the ammo you use. Based on the type of hunt you have in mind, you should have zero-set your rifle for the appropriate distance.\r\n\r\nYour challenge is to hit not just one game target, but two game targets or even more. To meet this challenge you will need to align the two or more game animals so that they are in the same line of fire. For this kind of hunt, it is best to use solid round nose bullet. Using bullet type - like hollow point, is likely to break up in the first target and perhaps not even hit the second target. For this reason, just stick to the 40-grain solid lead bullet. The cartridge should be high velocity type - not standard velocity.\r\n\r\nOnce you get your first double-hit, you will want to try it again and again.', ''),

(355516, ' Dear Ahtasham Bhai,\n\nLet me first congratulate you for your great contribution to PG&#8217;s small hunting community. I''m so glad you took pain & spent lot of time & wrote all this useful stuff for the safety of our fellow hunters. \n\nThe best thing I liked in your article is that you wrote the safety tips exactly according to the prevailing environment & "hunting mahol" of Pakistan, whereas, most of the tips published by Goras (though very useful) are designed according to THEIR OWN environment ... so at times we, in Pakistan may not fully understand what they mean. So my hats off to you once again !\n\nI think this is a very useful document & must be preserved as a part of permanent syndicate of Pak Guns & (CHAP also) I would humbly suggest you to kindly give me permission to edit its grammar &  beautify it''s layout so that &#8220;mummy daddy people" may not find any &#8220;keeray&#8221; in this wonderful document ... lol \n\nFor this I would suggest that first we accumulate all suggestions and relevant points contributed by all our hunter brothers and then we re-compose the whole document in a proper & professional format. \n\nAhtasham bhai, since this is your work & you''ve worked so hard to narrate all these points, I would humbly suggest you to kindly use headings and sub headings and give serial numbers to all points for easy reference & reading ... I hope you''ll kindly agree. \n\nMeanwhile, I have noted the following few points which may need further improvement (if you agree.)\n\nYou Said : &#8226; While entering unknown waters never wear a wader, adding to it, never wear a wader while riding over a boat.\n\nI think we must also emphasize, rather insist our fellow hunters to use a WADER BELT, especially when its waist high and a must for chest high wader because in case you fall into water, the wader gets filled with lot of water so quickly and becomes so heavy, it drowns the hunter INSTANTLY (even if he&#8217;s a swimmer) ... if people get confused with what a wader belt is .. they can use any belt or ever an ordinary rope around their waist  (preferably two between chest & waist if it&#8217;s not a built in wader belt) & minimize this big risk. It''s a pity, most of the low quality waders found in Pakistan don''t happen to have any belts or loops for the belts with them & many of our fellow hunters don''t even know the importance of this belt ... if I don''t exaggerate, I would call it the &#8220;LIFE BELT&#8221;  of any wader user !\n\nI noted another well written point of yours to which I won''t agree .. though I''m quite a junior duck hunter ... !\n\nYou said : &#8226;Never fire while sitting, always shoot in a standing posture, it will not only increase your bag, but is also a major safety guard.\n\nRespectfully, this point is applicable only if you are not using the layout blind in which the hunter has to lay down on the ground with his body & face totally camouflaged in the lay out blind & upon arrival of ducks, he cant stand up, rather he shoots them from his sitting position which requires lot of practice & it has it''s own set of precautionary measures taken into consideration. I think a brief mention of layout blind will also be a very useful addition. \n\nI also think a brief inclusion of first aid box & tool box would also be a nice & useful addition to this wonderful document. Rest all is perfect ..!!!\n\nAnd last but not the least safety tip is the SAFETY ATTITUDE ... What I mean by this term is that no matter how well trained, experienced and an EXPERT hunter you are, we must never hesitate to ask, discuss, communicate & let our fellow hunters know if there is something going wrong somewhere hidden or out of sight in our group that could potentially cause a hazard or accident. [B]I mean hamain shrmana nahi chahiay .. ke Ahtasham bhai kya kahain gay .. ke darhi chiti ho gai .. laiken isy itni choti se baat nahi pata &#8230; and we make a mistake of remaining silent & therefore cause great risks for ourselves & others [/B] We must not forget, we all learn from each other & duck hunting is perhaps one of the very few activities which demands mutual respect, teamwork, clear communication and above all brotherly care of each others'' comfort & safety ... the results are obviously great !\n\nAhtasham Bhai, I hope you&#8217;ll work more to elaborate this very useful document !\n\nWith my best regards, I remain, \n\nSincerely yours', ''),

This option is quite expensive especially for decoys as freight will be charged by volume not the net weight, import duties are another issue with courier companies, I tried DHL, UPS, Fedex but they just hand you over their own bill having only one figure that doesnot state what these charges are about. When inquired from courier they told me that when their whole shipment ( consisting all the parcels coming that day) arrives at Pakistan airport they file a single bill of entry for all the parcels and duty is paid collectively so they devide this amount among all the small shipments without any set formula. So I am sure when your parcel of decoys will arrive they will charge you quite heavily as your parcel will be biggest of all.\n\n2) USPS (United States Parcel Post): This service is not faster like courier but takes 7-10 days to reach your nearest Head Post Office, although they give you a tracking number but it stops telling anything you after shipment is boarded from US.  USPS shipments land and are customed at nearest Head Post Office of destination (in my case Sialkot HPO Foreign Post branch). In your case I will suggest you to go for this option but after doing a thorough research like which HPO will be catering you and also try going there to make some pre-shipment arrangements & acquaintances ;) as the custom staff at foreign post office always try to squeeze as much as they can (legal & CHAI PANNI as well) because they have quite a few parcels to handle thus make lot of fuss when see a MURGHA ;)   so an acquaintance there will be a good thing to avoid unnecessary hassle when your shipment arrives and you are desperate to see, hold n use your new toys ;)\n\nOnce again if you are importing something individually for personal use there are no confirm duty structure that customs will follow.', ''),

The upper portion that is, the head & neck is made solid (though light) so it looks quite real & the lower body of the decoy is lightweight inflatable plastic with real photos of duck printed on them so they render a photo-realsism perspective which is far better than any brightly painted decoy. Another great advantage is that unlike the conventional decoys, none of these decoys happen to have any keel under them & the belly is totally flat & free of any obstruction ... so it floats & moves & this will obviously give it an edge over the others.\r\n\r\nThe best thing I like in these decoys is that they are so COMPACT & so LIGHT you can carry dozens of them in just a small bag, whereas, all other conventional plastic shell decoys demand more volume.\r\n\r\nHome Page : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/default.aspx[/url]\r\nWaterfowl Products : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/c-6-waterfowl-hunting-products.aspx[/url]\r\nGadwall Decoys : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/p-23-gadwall-per-6.aspx[/url]\r\nGreen Wing Teal Decoys :[url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/p-24-green-wing-teal-per-6.aspx[/url]\r\nMallard Decoys : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/p-21-mallard-per-6.aspx[/url]\r\nPintail Decoys : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/p-22-pintail-per-6.aspx[/url]\r\nRing Neck Decoys : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/p-74-ring-neck-per-6.aspx[/url]\r\nShoveller Decoys : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/p-43-shoveler-per-6.aspx[/url]\r\nWood Duck Decoys : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/p-26-wood-duck-per-6.aspx[/url]\r\nWigeon Decoys : [url]http://www.cherokee-sports.com/p-42-wigeon-sold-out-for-the-season.aspx[/url]\r\n\r\nAnd here are some videos of hunters using these decoys.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olfiy3sCF88[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnsc1PoJpro[/url]\r\n\r\nHappy hunting ... \r\n\r\nKind Regards[/QUOTE]\r\n \r\nvery nice decoy intro by you...had read abt them somewhere but didnt know they were rugged and good in field too.', ''),

(355024, 'Review: Dan Wesson Valor .45 ACP Salams, \n\nI recently bought a Dan Wesson Valor (Bobtail Commander), which is probably the best production 1911 money can buy. \n\nThe gun true to the 1911 heritage is in .45 ACP, has grip and external safeties, Trijicon ''Straight 8'' night sights and awesome looking G 10 grips. Calling this a production gun is almost an insult, everything about it is custom / hand built. The slide to frame / barrel / bushing fitting is so tight and perfect that it took me the better part of an hour disassemble and reassemble it.  The machining is simply outstanding. \n\nHolding the gun for the first time the word that comes to mind is quality. It feels solid and if I might say extremely badass. I''ve been around guns all my life but only when handling the Valor I understood the feeling criminals must feel when holding a gun for the first time, ''Empowerment''. You know a weapon is special when it makes you feel something other than just wanting it. \n\nThe tech specs: Made of Forged Stainless Steel with a 4.3 inch Match grade barrel, two high quality ''CheckMate'' 8 rounds mags, weighing around 2.2 lbs (1000g) and with the amazing DUTY finish. The trigger is adjustable and around 4.5 pounds from the factory. \n\nNow for some pictures:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/DW1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/DW7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw8.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw9.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw10.jpg[/IMG]', ''),
(355025, ' Following are some comparative pics with the Taurus 1911 which is our benchmark for 1911''s here in Pakistan.\n\nMy PT1911 is a full framed 1911 with a 5 inch barrel while the Valor is a  Commander model which basically has a shorter barrel length for easier  carry.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw11.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw12.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw13.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw14.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw15.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw17.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw16.jpg[/IMG]\n\nIn my opinion there is no comparison in quality between these two guns.  The DW is in another class altogether. A decent comparison would be with  other 1911 names like Kimber or perhaps even Les Baer. \n\nSince this is a carry gun rather than a range gun what really  makes it stand out is the DUTY or Ceramic coating on the stainless steel  frame/slide. It is very scratch resistant and although I would not like  to experiment on my piece this link  [URL]http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/01/05/czs-new-dan-wesson-valor-1911-with-duty-coating/[/URL]  should make things clear.', ''),
(355026, ' Shooting the Valor:\n\nI couldn''t wait for range day to shoot the DW. Bought 300 rounds of different makes to test it. \n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/DW18.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw19.jpg[/IMG]\n\nLoaded the mags, racked the slide to chamber the round, the gun felt  even better. Fired it and went "****", but then I''m not much of a .45 fan. My targets were not post  worthy and asked Starfish, Anthrax and Omer Butt to shoot the gun for  posting. All shot the crap out of the targets at 15 M. Groups were  everywhere. Thanks guys, making me look bad :mmph: ;)\n\nTargets below:\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw20.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/Dw21.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/IMG_0521.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe gun itself is fabulous and extremely accurate. It is a pure carry gun with does not  disappoint come range day. None of the guys who shot this gun had any  issues with it, I did however have some observations. \n\n1). The grip chequring is too aggressive for me at 25 LPI. I would have  preferred it at something like 30 or 35. The gun is very grippy indeed  with the 25 but made my hands feel like cheese through a grater after 30  rounds.\n\n2). The trigger sort of bites your fingertip. Each shot felt like a pin prick. \n\n3). The recoil is substantial, so much so that after firing the first 5  shots everyone was shooting atleast 2/3 inches from the center.\n\n4). Trigger although at 4 / 4.5 has a very slight creep in it. I would  love no creep and would not mind predictable creep but the way it  breaks, I did not like 100 %.\n\nI tried a misfit Houge over the grips to see if it helped improve shooting and it did but the trigger still bit. \n\nI have shot upto 1500 rounds in a day but never have I had swollen  fingers, the DW is the only gun to make my hands and fingertip in  particular to swell and hurt for more than 24 hours. One might compare it to a rug burn, it hurts but you''re happy why you got it ;)\n\nI would like to say that all of the other friends who fired it  did not experience any of the above except more recoil but then this is  not a range gun, it is a pure thoroughbred combat handgun which allows  you to shoot two or three mags at the the range now and then. \n\n[U][B]Verdict[/B][/U]: An absolute prize for anyone who likes to carry .45''s and the full length Valor is the best 1911 around, period.', ''),

This is Pakistan, our dealers evade the notifications via bribes and paperwork quite efficiently. Hell the people at customs wont even know the law of 18'''' barrel length being minimum, otherwise 100s of rifles below 18'''' wouldn''t be registered onto licenses themselves! Clearly no one cares about that law and it is not enforced by the authorities either. Its a hit and miss sometimes it arrives sometimes it does not. Some countries require you to make them aware of the law before you import from them, thats why the ARs coming from the Czech Republic are 18'''' because they require a lot of check and balance before they send it out to dealers in Pak. On the other hand China doesnt really care as long as they are getting payed and will make the product and mark it to your preference as we have seen in all the different markings present on norinco CQAs in the same shipment.', ''),

(355090, ' very well topic dr hanif brother.\r\nyes the current and expected rainfalls in moon soon have boosted up our moral for the coming duck season,\r\n\r\ni am not an experienced hunter like others here but my observations are as follows:-\r\nEARLY MIGRATORS  AND THEIR HABITAT\r\n 1) ducks usually (teals) arrive in late august at our hunting grounds.\r\n2) one can see heavy duck movement during early morning and in the late evening bcz temperature is too high those days and     ducks move less during day time unless disturbed.\r\n3) coming in late august mostly ducks like rice fields which are just a few inches tall and full of water.these fields are good source of feeding (small herbs and insects etc ) for the ducks and plus point for the ducks migrating early is that such fields protect them from direct sunlight and provide shelter to them \r\n4) u will find very few ducks in open water holes from late august to september,as i said they prefer sheltered water spots (rice fields)  to minimize direct contact to sunlight \r\n\r\nNOW TALKING ABOUT THE GUNS,DECOYS,LAYOUTS ETC\r\n1) to my observation one should have a good "raiki" of the field before hunt,decoys  dont work good i mean if u place decoys in open water and rice fields are far away from your spot then the flock of ducks passing nearby (obviously not in firing range) will prefer the rice fields instead of your open water spread. \r\nan open water spot near rice fields will work much better in early morning and late evening\r\n2) after "raiki" u can enjoy your game 2 to 2.5 hours in the morning and 2 to 2.5 hours in the evening,just go to the spot and wait for the ducks with a few decoys (i think 5 to 10 will be enough).\r\n3) cover the spot from different angles but be careful not to cross fire!\r\n4) hunters waiting for the ducks in hot noon time might get frustrated bcz ducks will not move at day time unless disturbed.\r\n5) gun choice is a personal preference,i use my Browning A-5 semi autometic,but this season new baikal sporting is also waiting for the ducks!\r\n6) i usually shoot shaheen 4 and 6 at early arriving teals.last season had a bad experience with cyprus made Victory 33.5 gram.\r\n\r\nABOUT CLOTHING:-\r\n1) i use cotton shirts (green or camo)  and jeans (use full sleeves as precautionary measures against small insects,mosquitoes etc).\r\n2) Camo Hat or Cap to avoid sunlight.\r\n\r\nPRECAUTIONARY MEASURES:-\r\n1) Always carry drinking Water with u.\r\n2) Be careful about the snakes and other insects.\r\n3) never ever enter in an unknown water unless u r a good swimmer.\r\nmy Ustaad G says (even if u kill a duck completely made of gold and it drops in a water of unknown depth then leave it and dont enter in that water)\r\nregards', ''),

My village is in District Thatta, Tehsil Ketty Bunder. so we use the national highway not the super highway for our traveling. My uncle and his driver (who is an all purpose guy) saw a road blockade just after the city of Mirpur Sakro. The time was around 11:30 or maybe 11:45 to be exact, he told the driver to stop the car, i think he stopped 20 ft away from the blockade, and as soon as the car stopped the action began, 4 to 6 men jumped out from the bushes with G3s in there hand cause the Dacoits in the interior sindh only carry G3s or Kalashnikovs, and i must tell u this that the Dacoits in the interior sindh r very well trained with weapons. So my uncle and his driver got out of the car quickly and went behind the car to take cover at this time my uncle had already chambered his 9mm Sarsilmaz and fired an ariel shot so tht the dacoits would know tht r loaded and ready for action , when they were behind the car he opened the trunk of the car and took out his Ak47 (Russian) and started firing at the dacoits, his driver had a .30 bore pistol pakistani Star with which he fired shots at the dacoits. The best part about this encounter was that my uncle killed one dacoit and the rest ran through the bushes into the jungle. The sad part about the encounter is that my uncle got hit on the leg. \n\nAnyways this was a small story which i wanted to share with all the PakGuns members.', ''),

[/FONT]\n \n \n[FONT=Times New Roman]There are some observations / guidelines purely based on experiences of me and team during waterfowling, which can help you to safeguard you in practical game. However, Calamity befalls to anyone. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Always hold your positions in blind in a straight line. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Spectators / without Gun (If Any) should retain his position right behind the gun carrying team.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Always sit in a way that your faces are directed towards (Landing Zone / Decoys spread). [/FONT]\n \n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never fire while sitting, always shoot in a standing posture, it will not only increase your bag, but is also a major safety guard.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never ever shoot over the head of your teammate (Left - Right). It has always proved dangerous and there are several accidents reported due to this very reason.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Always sit with your weapon showing (Red) safety button in locked position. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never play with (Safety sketch, Trigger, hammer''s etc.) it&#8217;s a very common habit of hunters in the hideout (especially those who are holding some expensive onez) that they start clean loaded guns in the hide. Major accident occurred due to this very reason on numerous occasions. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never open / close your DBBL unnecessarily. It will not only damage gun but also cause other several ambiguities like problems in gun fit and adjustments etc. Furhter there are chances a cartridge can be pressed within chember and grip portion. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never point your muzzles at anything (Especially at living things) unnecessarily in any case please. Whether, you are sure (100%) that your gun is empty. Worst thing at our part is pointing a weapon at any living thing. For me, such people are not even dangerous but unethical too, avoid them if they repeatedly find doing such practices.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Guest should be prior advised not to touch any weapons while sitting in hideout, until and unless, gun owner makes sure its empty.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Always trust a weapon after ejecting and looking into barrels / Chambers.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never allow spectators (if any without gun in hideout) to stand up while gunner stood up for shooting. Its not just bad, but worst.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Spectators should be properly instructed for not to running after the dropped birds, until and unless, they are allowed and shooters have completely done with their shooting.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]In any case if ur gun falls to any hard surface please never follow it, several time it reported a bang. Please be very careful in holding loading weapons always. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]One element is very common and many accidents reported due to this very motive that after dropping bird&#8217;s people start rushing towards them. Without &#8220;Locking Safety Sketches&#8221;. This is the most unsafe / horrible act than anything else. (Maximum Danger involved) numerous chances of damage. Please avoid rushing with loaded guns & ensure your safety first.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Try to sit in hideout in a position that your guns should standing along with hideout well in range to carry them in no time when desired. This is best thing one can do to safeguard him and other to his maximum. We always follow this rule strictly.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Sometime we drop safety button but did not get opportunity to fire (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE) lock your gun at once. This particular reason caused maximum damages on game. Always try to ensure everybody Re-locked his gun afterwards. Don&#8217;t even feel shy to ask, everybody relocks please.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never ever (in any circumstances) hit your gun stock to the ground. People are often in habit to throw their gun at ground (in routine), which is a serious act and many time accidents happened due to automatic (Jerk) fire by the gun. I know two hunters who have practically faced the music due to this bad habit. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never put your barrels side on ground. Ensure there&#8217;s not a hurdle in barrels, if it touched unintentionally. We have damaged a gun due to mud the barrels (Thanks Allah, no damage done, except gun loss barrel which turned from 30 inches to 26). [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Calibri]Cartridges [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]wads can be very dangerous sometime not just damages the gun and but injure people. Whenever, you feel a different fire sound or different recoil, please ensure there&#8217;s no obstruction in barrels. It happens to us while we were shooting coots over a speed boat and using SUNSHINE cartridge. Thanks, Allah, who kept us safe after this whole disaster. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Avoid holding loaded weapons while travelling to game in a vehicle. If area demands security etc., always put your barrels out of vehicle pointing upwards in any case. Many damages have done due to loaded weapons. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Gunners, please always take care of your pickers / helpers, who are also around and they can always run for anything or for nothing especially during rope hunting its so dangerous please be very careful during rope game.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Possess utmost care while shooting any wounded birds (Wingers specially) because u never know your pellets can slip anywhere at water or any obstacle can change their direction so be more careful here. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never carry gun while spreading decoys. Countless reasons hard to narrate in a go.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]In addition to safety of your valued decoy spread etc. its also ethical to always fire, above ground level. Avoid sitters and water level shots. Pallets can go anywhere after skidding.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Don&#8217;t trust life jackets merely, if u has no swimming experience. Entering any water, especially, first time (marshes, rivers, lakes etc.) needs a partner with you carrying a rope around you in addition to your life jacket etc. (Several Ambiguities, needs a long elaboration).[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]While entering unknown waters never wear a wader, adding to it, never wear a wader while riding over a boat.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Never rush to the bird in water without taking proper water safety measures. It is the major cause of accidents always. Don&#8217;t trust water&#8217;s in your life ever please.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Swamps and bogs are biggest proven threat to life of the hunter and countless incidents where damages have reported due to soggy lands. Please be very careful entering soggy lands. If it&#8217;s inevitable to enter such places, please, always have a helper around. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]If u caught up in swamp / bog upto knee high (Mind it, your problem has started now). Never try too hard to pull your legs out in standing position ever. Throw your body down and try to pull your legs slowly now. Get out of this hell using crawling technique always. Please don&#8217;t panic at this state otherwise results will be disastrous.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Always carry few cartridges with permanent wearing&#8217;s i.e. (Vest, shirt, trouser etc.). In case of any mishap where u are apart from your team, fire these round in a sequence (insistently) so that your team may know that u have caught in some trouble and need help. We all teammate are well conversant with this technique and used it for several purposes according to situation.[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]If u have caught up badly and no way to get out in quick time, its time to ask for help quickly. First thing to remember at this stage is to keep your mind calm. Use one of the following techniques (1- Shouting 2- Use cell phone 3- use gun and go for continuous firing.) The 3rd on saved me once. (Key 2 your success is now &#8220;Don&#8217;t Loose Temper & Play Calm).[/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]While entering Marshes / Koondar, always keep in mind the direction and area of entering them Sun direction can help u or any trees around. Always mark something in your mind because there are robust chances that u may lost inside. Mind it, its always been a big problem. Especially in days when there''s humidity (Sept. &#8211; Oct.) avoid entering Marshes / koonder because you certainly feel short of breathing suddenly. Another element is water can be deeper inside and that will be worst too. [/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Symbol]· [/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman]Always ensure there''s no presence of people / dera''s / cattle&#8217;s etc. at lease in 200 meters of circle from your hideout.

(355286, '22LR Ammunition Variability Center fire users have the luxury of being able to custom load ammunition to achieve much stringent measurement tolerances than offered by commercial manufacturers. In the 22LR field we have no such luxury. We are the mercy of what we can find the marketplace. This means paying premium prices for high-end 22LR ammo labels. Buying such ammo is no assurance that we will get high accuracy (see post #226, 22LR Cheap Ammo Beat Expensive Brands).\n \nIn the field of ammunition, we want the type that is consistent, with minimum variability. How can we do this? We can accomplish this by weighing 22LR cartridges and select those with the least variation. Cartridges that fall within a narrow range of weight are are likely to perform better than those that have larger weight variations. In weighing the cartridges, the variation could be due to the propellant (powder) or the bullet or a combination of both. Regardless, we want the weight variations to be minimal. \n \nThe process is simple. Weigh the cartridges and sort them. Any that at the extremes - the very low and the very high in weight can be considered as deviants that may result in "flyers" (see post #233, 22LR - Minimizing "Flyer" Shots).\n \nIf we want to stay away from the budget-killing high price 22LR ammo, how can select from the ammo that is available at reasonable prices? One way is to select ammo that has proven to be lower in cartridge weight variations. In doing some actual weighing, my findings are the following - in the order of least variations to the most variations in weight:\n \nWinchester Xpert, 36-grain\nRemington Golden Bullet 40-grain & 36-grain (a tie)\nRemington Yellow Jacket, 33-grain\n \nYou can get a small digital scale, the kind jewelers use to weigh your 22LR ammo. The resulting effort will improve the "quality" of your 22LR ammo. Whatever brand or type you buy, weigh it and sort it.', ''),

Your friend was a lucky chap in many many aspects and so was his family. Things just went into their favour. Most probably, the BGs were also &#8220;anaari&#8221; sort of criminals who usually carry low quality weapons and had no one in their back up.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]I would second idea of a fast reverse followed by a J turn and fire some shots to convey a message to those bastards that don&#8217;t dare to follow. Next is the time to show the racing skills.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]Idea of a separate section for &#8216;Real SD events&#8217; is excellent.

Plz consider.[/SIZE][/FONT]\n \n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=4]Allah is the biggest protector and we should recite some Quranic verses known for protection on leaving our homes.
