(643955, 'What is holding back the firearms industry? - Pakistan Ill be straightforward. \nPakistan has gotten better. \nCompared to the last few years \nless bombs, less power outages and a slightly less chance of getting mugged and kidnapped for a ransom. \n\nSo what exactly is holding back the firearms industry in pak? \nTaxes on foreign imports are sky high. \n\nOur local makes are STILL restricted to Darra make and the same few models from POF, daudsons and the lot. \nI mean its been over a year or two now since we heard of the pk-9 and the trueshot, yet no updates to them, or new models , or any other new ideas put forth and put into production. We havent started making any quality ammo on a commercial/ industrial scale with internal competition as is the condition in the USA ( CCI vs tula vs american eagle and so on and on )  \n\nGun buying and selling is still shady and murky as ever, not even close to crystal clear. Laws regarding firearms are as grey as ever. Its still difficult for most to access a proper range.\nLicencing is still a mess. \nAnd this is roughly the same condition as 5, or even 10 years ago. \n\nIts been so long, with so little change. \n\nWhat is holding all of this back? \nPolitics? Lethargy of gun makers themselves? public opinion? foreign policy?\nAll of the above?\n\nIve been on this fourm for a few years now, and meddling bit by bit in the local firearm scene when i could. No progress. When i came back in 2006, its the exact same as then ( more or less ) and its been just under a decade now. Its saddening more then anything else. \n\nIn these 9 years ive seen everything progress. medicine, education, communication, hell we even get cars i could call decent and respectable now with some sort of variety and we DONT have to import them personally. We have motorcycles going upto 125-150 cc locally with up to date engine tech. ( looking at you yamaha ). Book shops with ample material are commonplace and we have all the little gadgets and gizmos. We have internet going upto 50mbps and its accessible to almost all. Sure its still not the best place.. but... \n\nI can easily say to another person, even a foreigner now that provided a person tried, he..( or rather I )  could live a far more satisfying life here then in any first world country. \n\nOut of every single thing im interested in , firearms has been the one place where nothing in particular has happened. \n\nWhats wrong?', ''),

Trust me, much effort for put into designing of the Kilinc and it shows\n- In USA, Armalite is selling the Kilinc as AR24 since they were so deeply inspired by the quality of this particular pistol\n- Its a  forged steel frame, slide and barrel, making it a very solid, durable and stable pistol\n- The weight from steel frame make it a natural pointer\n- Excellent Ergonomics, well what do you expect, its a CZ Clone\n- Despite its weight, the extra ordinary slim profile of the gun makes it easy to conceal. I carry it everyday\n- The Kilinc has a slightly longer barrel, and it is an extremely accurate handgun specially at long ranges\n\n\nHowever, what I have learned so far about the Kilinc:\n\n- The Cz 75 grips dont fit in, I tried a number of wooden and rubber grips\n- With the Cz 75 magazines I tried, they did not fit into the Kilinc 2000, well why would I want to do that anyway, since Sarsilmaz spare   mags are available in Karachi market for 6k\n\nThings I don''t like about the Kilinc 2000\n- There only one bit I dont like about the Kilinc 2000 and thats the grips, the factory fitted platic grips look very toyish even though they work just fine but I have a serious problem with the way they look...Not pretty\n\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/ba1ljohlh/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/ba1ljohlh/IMAG1092.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

There are a few things to check for in this rifle. \n1. Firstly see if the sights are not canted, i.e. are straight and in line.\n2. Open the dust cover of the rifle check the chamber if it is done properly and doesnt have burrs or excessive tooling marks.\n3. Check in the lower receiver where the bolt carrier rides for rust and also around the trigger mechanism.\n4. Check that the parts on the bolt, the bolt carrier and the top cover are matching or not.\n5. Visually inspect fit and finish, look for wobbly hand guard, wobbly stock(although unlikely with the fixed one), fit of the magazine in the rifle (allow some wobble here since it is part of the design of low tolerances)\nAlso check the safety, if it is not too tight as that is a problem in some of these rifles, not exactly a problem but if you are paying a premium price you should get a premium rifle. \n\n\nThis is as much info as I can give through forum.

From price point of view also.[/QUOTE]\n\nRight now 30 round mags are available but most are chinese a few are american metal magazines. The american ones are going for 3500. As for the top quality magpul Pmags, they have run out in Lahore not too sure about Islamabad definitely would be available in Peshawar. I think 5500 for the standard ones and 6500 for the window mags.\n\nAs for the Aimpoint Micro H-1 red dot sight. You really cannot go wrong with an aimpoint and Im no one to review it as there have been 100s of reviews on youtube and other websites. It is a strong reliable accurate and robust sight. The price is extremely steep but you will get what you pay for. It lasts 7 years on full power, which means you will be able to use it for years and years.', ''),

Open the dust cover of the rifle check the chamber if it is done properly and doesnt have burrs or excessive tooling marks.\n3. Check in the lower receiver where the bolt carrier rides for rust and also around the trigger mechanism.\n4. Check that the parts on the bolt, the bolt carrier and the top cover are matching or not.\n5. Visually inspect fit and finish, look for wobbly hand guard, wobbly stock(although unlikely with the fixed one), fit of the magazine in the rifle (allow some wobble here since it is part of the design of low tolerances)\nAlso check the safety, if it is not too tight as that is a problem in some of these rifles, not exactly a problem but if you are paying a premium price you should get a premium rifle. \n\n\nThis is as much info as I can give through forum.

(644117, ' [QUOTE=Abbas;86564]Salams guys,\n\nI''ve never been a big fan of .30 (7.62x25) as a SD/HD round due to it''s over penetrative nature and the TT pistol in general because I think it''s butt ugly. But there is no denying that TT variants are the most popular and wide spread weapon in Pakistan. I had been considering getting one for myself but did not like the TT''s commonly available in the market. About a year back I came across a TT in stainless steel finish online, I loved it. I have been looking for one since then but could not find it as the Stainless Steel finish was almost exclusively made for 9mm variants instead of 7.62. So I did the next best thing, if there is one weapon that Pakistani gun smiths can make better than any one and with their eyes closed, it''s the TT. I got the frame and slide made locally and got everything else substituted with foreign parts. Here is the result.\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT2.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT4.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT5.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT6.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nAs with all new weapons specially locally made ones, they require a break in and even a shop adjustment period to come into their own.\n\nI have left the slide and all else blank for the time being as I want to get it engraved in the near future.

I have seen quite a lot of local clones (none of P01) and they are not half decent. Even Islam ud Din Sons which apparently have better looking clones of sig are not appealing once seen in person. And how the hell would a local manufacturer find out about the serial number of an original CZ? Does the importer of CZ in Pakistan shares all the serial numbers with local manufacturers? The local manufacturers can never go to this extent. So enjoy your gun and i guess there is no point in discussing this thing any further.', ''),

People buy a 700 dollar Remington 700 and put a 3000 dollar US optics scope on it. The technology and material required to make the scope is far more expensive and advanced than the rifle and it makes you rifle perform what it is capable off. That said, you dont need an Aimpoint to have fun with your AR, bushnell red dots along with some other knock offs or cheap red dot sights are plenty to have fun with. If the price is too much for you go for that. Also I got the window mags from a chap who had bought a lot of them and sold some to me. Dont know any dealer selling them at the moment.', ''),

(644373, ' Salam All,\nHaving been involved in manufacturing now for over a decade... I have this to say...\n\nManufacturing licenses were only issued KPK and no where else in the country.  Furthermore, those factories are restricted to the areas of industrial estates in Peshawar....  I thought for a while that since its a KPK license... why not set it up just past Pir Sohawa outside of Isloo in KPK territory - this way I don''t have to relocate.  That turned out to be a big NO.  Those with manufacturing licenses in other provinces were issued decades ago.  Why not promote this industry?  Dunno; but every winning government party has always been unfavorable to issuing new manufacturing licenses.  I myself have been trying to get a license for over a decade in either Isloo or RWP.  Nothing ever materialized.\n\nToo much back stabbing.  No use to spend tons of money a genuine idea only to have it copied by the guy next door...  To add salt to injury - having a customer walk in and insult your product price by mentioning that the other idiot down the road is making/selling for less.\n\nThe lack of proper engineering.  Whilst some do have the skill learned... majority of the factory worker on the floor do not and nor are they taught.  They are the fitters.  They are just told to fit parts.... so the ignorance continues.\n\nThe old skill of hand craftsmanship has given way to the cnc machine users.  As the manufacturers slowly move into this new transition...  It will take time to perfect this.  Whilst the old craftsman of the era gone by are just that... gone by.  The first .30 bore copied was I am sure a piece of junk.  It took years and years to perfectly clone it.  You all can expect this for all the latest stuff being manufactured.  \n\nWhat is being manufactured currently in the markets over there...  1911 under works, Glock 19, 17, 34, 17L, HK USP, Stoeger, Sig Tac Ops, M4s, Mossberg 500s, Saigas, Taurus Millinium, and much much more.

Rifles are meant for long range shooting but their primary purpose is that they fire HIGH velocity rounds that give greater trauma and also yaw and tumble on entering flesh therefore creating channel wounds that can stop bodily functions or induce enough trauma and large wound cavities to stop a person. A handgun would be my last choice in a home defence scenario. If you were right then all the special forces in the world would rather use handguns to clear rooms rather than rifles.

(644523, ' I always find that there is still a lot to learn from you, dear seniors. There are considerations and factors involved in Home Defense scenarios and best compromise firearm, caliber and bullet. Home is always sweet and we live with our families there so it is different from battlefields, war zones and CQB/CQCs. Purpose usually is not to engage in a long gun battle with hurts of zombies coming from no where and killing them with MGs and Launchers in games, rather that bad guys with bad intentions (usually robbery) leave our comfort zone without causing any harm and loss as soon as possible and leave us alone. No one wants to be on the wrong side of a weapon so first rule should be to possess any BANG gun. Also it is defense and not offense, and we do never want to spray and prey bullets which can directly or indirectly hit or ricochet in direction of our loved ones, so we need a more menouverable gun (with a bullet that disintegrates at close distances). Another consideration is to STOP from doing whatever he intends to do and not to kill BG whatever it takes. Shotgun for self defense speaks of itself and proven firearm for HD, it is devastative up to 100 feet or more and that means a 2 kanal house. A double barrel or Pump is more reliable than auto. Handguns are okey as these free one of our hand/arm and we can use that to push someone, open doors and still point it in the harms way. You would never need a belt fed firearm while at home, why would a robber would try to involve in gun battle if there purpose is to steal something, unless you are outnumbered and other malicious intentions are involved by attackers. Rifles need better maintenance and storage, better training of families to live with and handle in time of need, range time (rifle ranges are limited as of my poor knowledge). A debatable advantage of 223 could be that it will disintegrate on collision with hard surfaces like walls, I am not sure at close range how it behaves. Lastly I would say have a weapon for HD that is very simple to operate, least moving parts/components, better/natural point-ability, easy to check/load/unload, easy to train and least suspicious for LEAs and better BANG as well (deterrance and fear factor). My 2+2 C and no hard feelings pls.', ''),

(644537, ' [QUOTE=Leon;482150]Ok!\r\n\r\nThe grace period is also over.\r\n\r\nThe story goes like this:\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, not very long ago, there was a renowned expert, let''s say Car expert. Once his friend requested him to help him buy a brand new luxury car. The expert suggested him to visit a far away city as a good brand new luxury car can be bought only from there.\r\n\r\nSo, they (the buyer and expert) traveled to far away city. Once reached there, the expert called in his expert mechanic friend and an expert denter painter friend.\r\n\r\nOnce the team got assembled, they raided the famous car dealership where the buyer friend has already order a luxury vehicle. All three expert keenly examined the car from inside out and gave verdict that authenticity / genuineness of the car is doubtful. Kindly note that the car was at authorized dealership.\r\n\r\nRather they suggested to visit the market and ended up founding the required luxury car at not so known dealer.\r\n\r\nThere they saw their required car say Honda Accord. Again, the exercise was repeated. They inspected the car inside out and declared it 101% genuine Honda Accord with 20 inch wheels and 1.5 liter engine and gave buyer a go ahead.\r\n\r\nThey bought the car and took that home. Once reached home that they realized that they had bought "Honda Accord" but the badges on the car say it is "Honda Pilot". Though it is Honda but not Accord.\r\n\r\nNow, just look at their expertise that they did not declared it doubtful then and there but wrote a letter to Honda asking if they every manufactured a car under brand name "Pilot".\r\n\r\nOf course, Honda''s reply was obvious. They denied making any car named pilot rather told that "Pilot" is there SUV.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the import documents of the car say it is "Accord" but every marking on the car says it is "Pilot".\r\n\r\nBut but but the experts did not budge. The again confirmed the buyer that it is a genuine / authentic Honda''s Car.\r\n\r\nThe story does end here. They took few pictures and wrote again to Honda that look at the pictures and tell us if this is not manufactured by you.\r\n\r\nAs expected Honda is not replying and the experts are still hopeful that Honda will accept that they somehow produced a car named "Pilot" which looks like "Accord" but behaves like "Pilot".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I need every Pakgun''s members opinion if they should be allowed to call themselves "The Car Experts".\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: read the story in context of Guns if you are facing difficulty with cars.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nLOLLLLLLLLL....

(644570, 'Type97 (T97NSR-A): Reviewed with Range Report Type 97 (T97NSR-A) is a semi auto sporting rifle with Bullpup mechanism. It is chambered in 5.56x45mm with a barrel length of 18.7". The design is based on QBZ-95 which actually is in 5.8x42mm and according to Wikipedia, is the rifle being used by the armed forces of PRC. The Type 97, which have been shipped to different countries including Pakistan are in the typical design with a fixed carrying handle on top. T97NSR-A which I got was a flat top upper receiver with a standard size picatinny rail.\nHere are some specs and then we would go into further details:\n·         18.7&#8243; barrel with muzzle brake\n·         Action: Semi auto\n·         Gas system= 3 position.\n·         Weight: 3.9kg (8.6lbs)\n·         Trigger pull: 4-5 lbs\n·         Overall length: 29.5 Inches\n·         Striker-Fire Mechanism\n \n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%202_zps6uspnx7q.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%202_zps6uspnx7q.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%206_zpsgr1aykcp.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%206_zpsgr1aykcp.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]Packing: [/B]\nThe rifle came in a cardboard box. The packing included 2 magazines, oil bottle, an instruction manual, packing list with the serial number of the rifle, a complete cleaning kit, and the rifle itself inside a polythene cover. I have been told that even the HK243 comes in a cardboard box so I guess that’s sufficient enough for Type 97.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/IMG_2837_zpsqqnzelk3.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/IMG_2837_zpsqqnzelk3.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[B]Magazines[/B]\nThe two magazines that came with the rifle are of exactly the same quality as the CQ-A mags. Regular AR Magazine perfectly fit the T97. I observed that the magazines sit in the magwell snuggly, however they have some play like the ones on AK; not something to be worried about. At the same time, the mag-release button is placed on the right side of the magwell at its rear. So it depends on the user if with their left hand they would reach to the right side of the buttstock and release the magazine with their index finger. And at the same time there would be users who would use their right hand to disband the magazine.\nIn comparison to AR, the mag insert and release of Type 97 leaves a lot to desire.\n \n\n[B]Manual Safety at Buttstock:[/B]\nDue to the Bullpup mechanism, the safety is positioned on the back of the rifle just below the shooters cheek.

(644571, ' [B]Trigger[/B]\nBeing a Bullpup, the trigger assembly remains at the buttstock and is connected with the trigger lever through a connecting rod. Now, I had imagined that this contraption of a trigger is going to be a nightmare but infact it wasn’t bad at all rather surprisingly good. The first stage travel is somewhat long with no creep or stiffness at all and then the second stage is a little short with clean break. The reset is minutely long but not at all uncomfortable in any way. The trigger guard is large enough to easily accommodate gloved fingers.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%208_zpsansdte8e.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%208_zpsansdte8e.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%204_zpsp8anlly1.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%204_zpsp8anlly1.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n  \n\n[B]Bolt Charging Handle[/B]\nThe rifle has short stroke gas system with a rotating bolt. It needs to be kept in mind that like AKs, it has reciprocating charging handle. Unlike the typical Type 97 which has a charging handle on the top, T97NSR has a side charging handle which interestingly can be shifted from left to right and vice versa per the requirements of the shooter. I would want to keep it on the left side so that my primary hand (right) remains on the pistol grip all the time.  \nThe bolt charging handle locks back once the magazine goes empty. After feeding in a fresh mag, the charging handle can be pulled back to cock the rifle. \n\n[I][B]Charging handle on the right side\n[/B][/I][URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/IMG_2854_zpsjrgm6th2.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/IMG_2854_zpsjrgm6th2.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[I][B]Charging handle on the left side\n[/B][/I][URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/IMG_2853_zpsbv78otoo.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/IMG_2853_zpsbv78otoo.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B][I]Bolt charging handle locked back with an empty magazine.

If it is set to 1, that is normal operation; setting 2 is for adverse conditions (muddy, dusty areas etc). Interestingly, if set to O, the rifle converts to a bolt action like system in which the shooter will have to cock the rifle every time by charging the bolt handle. I would prefer to keep the rifle at setting 1, where the recoil is much lesser sand second shot acquisition becomes comparatively easier.\n\n[B][I]Gas Port Setting at "0"\n[/I][/B][URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2012_zpshlcv8nsq.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2012_zpshlcv8nsq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n \n\n[B][I]Gas Port Setting at "1"\n[/I][/B][URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2013_zpsqibt8kpn.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2013_zpsqibt8kpn.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B][I]Gas Port Setting at "2"\n[/I][/B][URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2014_zpsvdsyqral.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2014_zpsvdsyqral.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]\n\nMiscellaneous  Info:\n[/B]1. The dis-assembly of the rifle can be done completely without tools. It has one push pin at the rear of the buttstock and another one which is behind the pistol grip. Disengaging the buttstock push pin removes the stock, bolt cover, striker assembly, bolt and main spring etc. At the same time removing the pin behind the pistol grip removes the trigger lever contraption from the connecting rod. \n\n[B][I]Rear Push Pin at the buttstock\n[/I][/B][URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%207_zpsmh0hvkcf.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%207_zpsmh0hvkcf.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[B][I]2nd Push Pin right behind the pistol grip\n[/I][/B][URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2010_zpsgw3cbhts.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2010_zpsgw3cbhts.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n2. Keeping in mind that its barrel length is more than 18”, I feel confident having it on my license and carrying it around as it adheres to the local NPB firearm (rifles) laws in Pakistan.\n\n3. Cleaning kit is also provided with the rifle which can be accommodated in the pistol grip. The opening under the pistol grip can be seen in the picture below. \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2022_zpsjiqzjoe5.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/Type97-%20Jibz%2022_zpsjiqzjoe5.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),
(644572, ' [B]Shooting Experience:[/B]\nNow let&#8217;s come to the most interesting part; shooting experience with T97NSR. On June 16, 2015, Colt1911, Nazim Sb, Ameer and myself had the opportunity to test fire it at a friend&#8217;s land in Burhan. We all had brought along many goodies but I am sure the prevailing excitement was how type 97 would perform on its maiden voyage at PG. And indeed, it surpassed our expectations and was a pleasure to shoot.\n[B][I]\nRecoil:[/I][/B]\nThe recoil was so minimal that it felt as if we were shooting a .22WMR. As most of the weight of the rifle is between the shooters primary hand and the shoulder, its balance automatically augments and the recoil becomes minimal. It was noted that when the Gas Port setting was at &#8220;2&#8221;, the rifle had slightly more recoil so we kept it set at &#8220;1&#8221;.\n \n[B][I]Ammo:[/I][/B]\nWe used two brands of ammo, [B]WCC 62 Grain M855[/B] and [B]FNB 62 Grain SS109.[/B] Shot 120 rounds with no issue at all. The rifle was throwing the empties about 20-30 feet at 2 o clock position. We didn&#8217;t face any failure in those 120 rounds. Next I plan to try out the ammo by LC as well as TAA; let&#8217;s see how it performs with those.\n \n[B][I]Accuracy:[/I][/B]\nOn temporary basis I had installed a so-so quality 4x scope on the rifle. It was not exactly zeroed on a bullseye rather the intention was to bring the impact on the paper and then see how the shots were grouping. I took the following screen shots from the video which we made. We didn''t have a proper bench to rest the rifle so we had to use the rooftop of Nazim Sb''s car as a rest. For our next visit we will be fully prepared along with a proper scope. InshAllah. \n \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/MVI_286700-55-05_zpsaxxwwntp.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/MVI_286700-55-05_zpsaxxwwntp.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/T97NSR/MVI_286700-47-51_zpsxtrvhuug.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/T97NSR/MVI_286700-47-51_zpsxtrvhuug.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),

It has secured $20 million in financing from  senior lenders in order to ensure it can keep operating in bankruptcy. A  court-supervised auction of some of the company’s assets is now  expected.\n Colt, now based in West Hartford, Conn., rose to prominence in the  mid-19th century under its eponymous founder, Samuel. The company’s most  famous product, the single-action “Peacemaker” pistol (also known as  the Colt .45), was standard issue to the U.S. Cavalry after the Civil  War, and its legend was burnished by association with real-life figures  such as Gen. George S. Patton, and by fictional ones in numerous Western  movies such as John Wayne’s “True Grit”.\n However, the company’s recent past has been checkered. It has already had one spell in Chapter 11, emerging from it in 1994.

At the range, you very correctly pointed out that the Gas Port setting at "0" will transform T97NSR in to a type of a bolt action rifle. I plan to install a good quality scope and then on our next session, I will use this setting to check its grouping. InshAllah. \nThe gas port hole at setting "2" is larger than setting "1" so more gas flow and better cycling, but at the same time slightly more recoil. In case if the 97 is showing no problem with setting "1", the user should stick to gas port setting 1. \nCheers', ''),

The concept of the pistol was developed jointly with specialists from the Russian armed forces and leading sports marksmen in their country.\r\n\r\nTranslation from official press release:\r\n\r\n"Kalashnikov Concern revealed the prototype of a new 9mm pistol “PL-14&#8243; (Pistol designed by Lebedev) at the International military-technical Forum «ARMY-2015» from June, 16 to June, 19 in Kubinka (Moscow region). The concept of the pistol was developed jointly by the experts of the Russian special forces and IPSC competitive shooters.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of “PL-14&#8243; is its enhanced ergonomics and balance that meet modern notions of human biomechanics and modern pistol shooting techniques in the best way. Special attention was paid to the unique aesthetics of the new pistol.\r\n\r\n“The versatility of our new pistol allows to use it not only as a military weapon for the military forces and police, but also as a pistol for different shooting competitions – said Kalashnikov CEO Alexey Krivoruchko. – We intend to produce different variants of the pistol, for example, with certain characteristics of the trigger mechanism for special forces units, as well as a civilian version with trigger that would be suitable for practical shooting competitions as well”.\r\n\r\nThe gun is very thin in comparison with its counterparts: the thickness of the grip is 28 mm and 21mm is the thickness at the front of the slide. All controls on the pistol are ambidextrous, so it could be used by right- and left- handed shooters effectively. The pistol has Picatinny rail integrated in its construction.\r\n\r\nAutomatic calculation methods applied during the creation of the gun, will ensure great reliability. With its improved ergonomics pistol has minimal recoil and muzzle rise which makes speed shooting very effective.\r\n\r\nParticular attention is paid to the safety of this pistol: trigger mechanism ensures that there will be no mechanical accidental discharge, even after falling from a great height onto a hard surface. In addition, the basic version will have longer and heavier trigger to prevent accidental discharge if shooter keeps his finger on the trigger. On another version of the pistol for highly skilled users (special forces and competitive shooters), trigger will be lighter.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the increased safety of the new 9mm pistol is provided by loaded chamber indicator, which allows checking the weapon even in gloves and during low light situations. In addition, the indicator has an additional function: coupled with a modified geometry of the chamber it allows shooting with defective ammunition when brass size does not meet the specs.\r\n\r\nCaliber,  9×19\r\nLength 220mm\r\nHeight 136mm\r\nThickness 28mm\r\nBarrel length 127mm\r\nMagazine capacity, 15 rounds\r\nWeight without ammunition, 0.8 kg\r\nWeight with ammunition 0.99 kg', ''),

If something is good its good no matter what the name. But the problem with the hatsan line of autoloaders and double barrels is that in autoloaders, as shahroze said, their o ring seals tend to break after around 250 cartridges and a problem common to the autoloaders and the double barrels is that hatsan does not properly treat its walnut stocks in an attempt to cut manufacturing costs and even though turkish walnut is considered among the finest, that leads to rattling and changes in the sound when the gun is fired.

These parts,  from the gas port drilled in the barrel, through the gas block, tube,  and the gas key in the bolt carrier, collectively make up the gas  system. With a few (piston-driven or single-shot) exceptions that we  won''t discuss here, pretty much all ARs cycle this way. What changes, though, is the location of the gas port along the  barrel. The gas port MUST be located far enough from the muzzle that the  pressure has time to kick the bolt carrier back before the bullet exits  about 1/4000th of a second later. That demands that the gas port be a  certain size, and a certain distance from the muzzle -- which actually  varies, because pressures change as you go further from the chamber. [B]So  shorter barrels need a shorter gas tube, and with the gas port closer to  the chamber, the pressures are higher.\n[/B]\n[B]Not just a little higher, either. Dramatically higher.\n[/B]\n\n[h=5][SIZE=4][B]Look at the chart below:[/B][/SIZE][/h] [TABLE]\n  [TR]\n[TH] [/TH]\n[TH][/TH]\n[TH][/TH]\n[/TR]\n [TR]\n [TD][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]\n[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][h=5][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]Look at the chart below:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/h][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4] [/SIZE][/COLOR][TABLE]\n  [TR]\n[TH][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]Gas System[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TH]\n[TH][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]Gas Port Location[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TH]\n[TH][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]Pressure (PSI)[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TH]\n[/TR]\n [TR]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]Pistol[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]4.7"[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]48,300[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [/TR]\n [TR]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]Carbine[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]7.8"[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]33,000[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [/TR]\n [TR]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]Mid-Length[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]9.8"[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]26,500[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [/TR]\n [TR]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]Rifle[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]13.2"[/SIZE][/COLOR][/TD]\n [TD][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4]19,600[/SIZE][/COLOR]\n[/TD]\n [/TR]\n  [/TABLE]\n[COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4] [/SIZE][/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=4] [/SIZE][/COLOR]\n\n[/TD]\n [/TR]\n [TR]\n [TD][/TD]\n [TD][/TD]\n [TD][/TD]\n [/TR]\n [TR]\n [TD][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n [TD][/TD]\n [/TR]\n [TR]\n [TD][/TD]\n [TD][/TD]\n [TD][/TD]\n [/TR]\n  [/TABLE]\n  This means the shorter your gas system is, the higher the pressures it''s  subjected to. The bolt and carrier are slammed harder; they work  harder, and the whole system becomes far more sensitive to anything  that''s not perfect. In addition, a shorter gas system is inevitably  harsher in operation, because it has to cycle in a shorter time.[/quote]\n\n[url]http://www.at3tactical.com/blogs/news/14625981-ar-15-barrels-barrel-length-gas-systems-and-rifling-part-2[/url]', ''),

The 709 is perfect in both areas and still has a decent enough grip as opposed to the 2-finger hold a Glock26 calls for, which is not at all practical and can be a hassle to draw and use and even a liability in a SD situation with adrenaline rushing and panic setting in.', ''),

I''m not criticizing you at all, but would just like to elaborate for everyone''s interest.\n\n"Playing with a gun" is pretty much whenever you''re (when I say "you" I mean anybody) handling a firearm but arent shooting . It be while cleaning, showing it off, dry firing, taking photos, admiring, fondling, etc. Say for instance you pull your gun out to clean. Drop the mag, clear the gun. It cleaned up well. So you decide to snap some pics while it''s shiny. You empty the mag and use the ammo as props, just to spice things up. The whole time, you have in your mind that you''ll put the ammo back when you''re done... and you do. But then you catch a glimpse of the gun at a certain angle that would make a great picture. So you put something in the trigger guard to hold it at just the right angle, and BANG. Sound far fetched? It''s not, because I saw something like that happen (it was actually a youtuber who caught the AD on video, he keeps all ammo in another room now when filming). Dumb things like that happen with unfortunate frequency, and its not because the person is dumb (ok, sometimes it is), but sometimes playing with guns while there''s ammo around is even more dangerous for the experienced shooter. Because they are so used to, like you said, [I]putting things back to their place[/I]... it becomes second nature. Bullets go in mags, and mags go into guns. I personally know someone who took out their HD gun to show off. It was the weekend and there were a bunch of guys sitting around the table after dinner BSing. So the gun was cleared and passed around, the unloaded ammo was put right on the table. There was one guy who wasn''t interested. So my friend took the gun back after everyone else was finished playing with it. Then, that one guy goes "let me see that thing". No problem. The next thing you know, bang! Luckily I wasn''t there, but my friend told me afterwards, he was just about to put the gun away, right before that guy asked to see it, and he didn''t even realize, he had loaded the gun. It happens, ask anyone who''s kept an HD gun for years, decades... what do they do when they''re putting it away? Insert mag, rack slide. Of course not everyone stores their guns loaded like that, but for the ones that do, they don''t think twice about it. \n\nAnyways, no one got hurt in those instances, but stay safe everybody, and have fun!\n\nIf anyone else has stories about AD''s/ND''s, please share. It''s a great way for us to learn what not to do... plus it''s fun to read about :)[/QUOTE]\n\nthat is so true. Thank god no one was hurt otherwise it would have been a nightmare with the RCMP. Thank god it has never happened my home. Just because guns are never toyed with, but I have been lucky to walk away from 3 such incidents. they took place at the users place due to non precautions attitude.

The meeting discussed the new arms policy that was being prepared by the Interior Ministry in order to bring transparency, uniformity and institutionalism into the system.\nChaudhry Nisar said, in view of the new challenges due to prevailing security situation, it was important that not only the existing arms licences were properly documented through NADRA but a comprehensive mechanism should be put in place to regulate and monitor the flow of arms into the country. Equally important was to bring standardisation of policy of the federal government and the provinces vis- -vis arms licensing in the country, he added.\nHe said in the first phase all licences issued from 1973 till June 2013 would be computerised through NADRA. The cut-off date for the validation had been fixed December 31, 2015. He said no further extension would be granted in this date and directed the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) and Ministry of Interior to launch an awareness campaign to motivate people to get their licences validated.\nThe meeting also discussed various proposals regarding regulating and monitoring the flow of arms in the country. It was proposed that a complete ban on import of prohibited weapons should be put in place. Only Ministry of Defence Production and security agencies should be allowed to import prohibited weapons. It was also proposed that individuals/entities, who stand qualified for these weapons, should procure their weapons only through Pakistan Ordnance Factory Wah.\nNisar also observed that regulating the business of arms dealers was also critical. He underscored the need for putting in place a policy on issuance of arms licences in the provinces as well as by the federal government. The meeting decided that nobody under the age of 25 years would be issued an arms licence. \nWhile discussing eligibility criteria for issuance of arms licences under the new policy, the interior minister stressed that the licence should only be issued after taking into account the security requirements of the applicants. Among others, media houses and media persons should also be facilitated as they face security challenges in their professional pursuits, he added. \n\n\n\n[url]http://pk.shafaqna.com/EN/PK/158316[/url]\n\n[RIGHT][COLOR=#8899AA][FONT=tahoma]Thursday 2 July 2015[/FONT][/COLOR][/RIGHT][/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

They will have have to send it to Quetta or the respective district in Balochistan. And I highly doubt they will do it unless there is a very important case. Coming to your domicile, a person can get domicile from the district mentioned in permanent address on his NIC. When someone wants a domicile from a place other than from where his father or the whole family has got their domiciles, he is required to provide a proof that he has got a residence in the new place for X number of years. I don''t know the exact number of years required. And again I don''t know how homeless people get their documents made. In almost all of the cases where somebody''s domicile is found is found to be fake, there is a complainant involved who thinks, and rightly so, that somebody has stolen his job or admission to university/college with a fake domicile. So, the bottom line is, if the permanent address on your NIC is the same as that of your domicile, you are almost safe. Name in the voter list is not an issue because the law allows you to vote on your current address', ''),

I remeber for many times the poor quality in russian weapons has been reported and discussed  on international blogs and forums like The fire arm blog etc and even the russsian president Putin once admonished the Izhvesk (sorry if mis spelled) for such poor quality .( now Izhvesk and an other russian arms manufecturing plant Izmash has been merged to form a single Kalashnikov concern). This happened when many countries returned russian weapons for poor quality.\nI have shared what i know and believe . The persons who advised me against the russian rifle had extensive experience of using such weapons and their usage is different from us as we hardly fire some thousand rounds in entire of our lives . I do not intend to engage a dialogue with my brother members . Your milage may differ . Google is your friend if you want to search on the issue of poor quality of russian weapons , some say their quality has improved since a unified  Kalashnikov concern has been formed , but since its formation  , i have not purchased any russian rifle  so can not comment .

(645690, ' Asslam o Alaikum Brothers,\n\n\nFirst of all Holy month of Ramzan mubarak to all of you.(Aameen)\nMany thanks to all brothers for their well wishes and congrats in the previous thread.\n\n\nI couldn''t find the other post about POF 5 where I stated that I''ve ordered and after an agonising wait it finally arrived.\nMost of the things and fears I stated before arrival of the gun are nearly true.\n\n\n1- Without a stock it''s practically useless.\n\n\n2- No spare mags.either one 30 rnd or two 15 rnd (maybe from POF-4) are (strictly) available when purchasing.\n\n\n3- The gun case of POF 5 advertised in newspaper add is not included.\n\n\n4- The strap supplied,only a "rangroot" can tie.(I''ve never used or owned Pak Military style straps)\n\n\n5- The gun arrived in a simple 2 part khaki card box without any markings of POF it''s lid goes all the way down to cover the box.Not the box "Mian Jee" has shown in picture.\n\n\n6- It came with a cleaning kit in a cheap plastic box and I have not used it yet.Contains a beaded chain,a soft brush and a wire brush with a few cotton threads.\n\n\n7- The build quality develops mixed feelings of a new gun made in 60''s and some modern polymer used here n there to make a feeling of "modernism" in ones mind.\n\n\n8- I specifically ordered 2015 stock POF bullets but got 2012 and 2013 packs in the\ngreen plastic bag of 500 which can be seen in the picture.\n\n\n9- So far have shot more than 400rnds of POF with 14 FTEs with basic cleaning.\n\n\n10- Other bullets fired were Chinese,Filipino,American and Czech in mixed amounts from 30 to 200 with no failures.\nOverall nearly 900+ rnds fired so far.\nI think I''ll stick to S&B,Armscor and Federal from now on.\n\n\n11- There was no manual booklet present as shown in American export models.\n(masters first,beggars later) \n\n\nAs I am pretty far away from Lahore and couldn''t leave my place the gun was bought by a person on his licence from POF outlet and then sold back to my dealer who in fact again put it in my name and I paid these extra costs plus delivery charges.\n \nAs "Colt 1911" stated that I bought Rs450/bullet of Federal Hydra shock 124gr JHP at a high price , he is right I think I paid 100-125Rs more as these bullets also came with the gun and were not available.No choice.  \n\n\nI already have stated before that I needed a weapon for "showoff" purpose in rural area and in pistol category without sacrificing any rife it was the best available choice and yes! it does the job quite well of scaring people when slinged around one''s body.(just like AK)\n\n\nMy ordered stock and spare mags haven''t arrived yet.\nAfter my "crises" is over I''m surely be switching to a compact proven model from Glock ,CZ or Hk.\n\n\nIn shooting terms it''s pretty accurate, so far I''ve been able to hit a cigarette pack from 100 feet and killed a Jackal with hydra shock from 30 yards or so at night while it was blinded by search light.The bullet did not go through it but it was brought down very quickly.\n\n\nIn short if anybody has ample money and licences and wants a new toy it''s worth it.\nNow after using it sometimes I feel I should have gone for POF-4 as it has a grip.\nPOF 5 is an ideal weapon with stock in pistol category as it has a longer barrel and can be used as a SBR with heavier loads.\nPersonally I wish it had a folding stock and a .357 bore chamber,then it was a keeper.\n\n\nInshAllah, will be updating about it''s performance from time to time.\n\n\n=========================\n\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35481[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35482[/ATTACH]\n\nBULLETS FIRED SO FAR\n115gr and 124g in JHP,HP,FMJ and Soft Tip\nfrom POF,China,S&B 115&124gr JHP and ST,Federal 124gr JHP and Armscor 124 JHP.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35485[/ATTACH]\n\nPOF 2013 bullet bought from POF outlet (no concept of product recall)\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35486[/ATTACH] \n\nA 45Rs and a 450Rs bullet\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35487[/ATTACH]\nPOF 9mm on left and American Federal Hydra shock 124gr JHP\nSeriously, how hard it is to make a bullet like this ?', ''),

(645818, ' I avoid arguments, but for your sake I will explain as best as I can, in the simplest terms. By the way I am not an engineer I left the Engineering university Lahore in 1967 to join the army.\nAll cartridges use only a portion of the energy in a propellant charge. Most of it is wasted as all powder does not burn inside the barrel some percentage burns outside the barrel, giving flash and smoke you have have noticed. Some is wasted in heating the barrel.\nAlso the greater the mass or greater the resistance to the propellant gases the faster these burn and higher and higher pressure results. It is an auto cycle that sets in. Higher mass of bullet or shot charge thereby also increases the powder efficiency or in other words  less powder results in comparative energy and pressure  levels. Pressure in all guns and rifles is  CONSTANT no cartridge goes above safe level whether it is a 22-250 or a .375  H&H Magnum all have the same maximum pressure. There are several other variables beyond the scope of this discussion.\nMost hunters are not aware a standard 12 gauge cartridge usually will have higher velocity than a Magnum or Super cartridge with more shot. What gives it more killing power? I"ll give you an example: a  duck hit by four pellets from a Super with its heavier charge will drop it at 50 yards where as the 3 pellets from a standard cartridge may not drop it at that range immediately.\nOne more thing I want you to know is that shot gun pellets have the worst ballistic co effecient and if they start at 1200 ft sec (super sonic) the deceleration is very steep; the moment these are sub sonic 1120 ft/sec or so the deceleration is much lower. Therefore the small velocity edge any magnum cartridge may  have  is lost within first ten yards of travel and by the time these reach at 40 yards these are at nearly identical velocities.  Cartridge pattern at subsonic muzzle velocity has fewer blow holes or a more uniform and denser pattern, when  compared with high velocity cartridges due to blow holes in their pattern; giving a better kill ratio or fewer winged birds in case of standard cartridges at ranges of 40 yards or so.\nIn ballistics there are so many variables and a single variance or a couple combined can have results beyond simple common sense. I am sorry if I have further complicated the issue. Please read twice and comprehend and then may be we can have some more discussion. Remember magnum or Super Cartridges do not increase the range; these help in cleanly downing larger birds  like Mallards, Geese etc. Matching shot size to game is the key to clean kills.', ''),

The corporations love people like you because you don''t know, or just don''t care that you''re being ripped off. For simple items like this, what difference does make? The American companies send the Chinese factories their specs and blueprints. Do you really think the "real" thing is better than the "fake" if they are the same in all aspects besides the name?

(646070, ' [QUOTE=zia raza;481184]Great advises sir, just want to ask when we buy a used weapon we usually check barrel by putting the ammo from projectile end in muzzle , is this a right way to check the condition of rifle, or are their any other ways through which we can get better results...\n Secondly how much projectile should enter in... Means the rifle is good to go... Some told me about approx 3/4 of the tip..[/QUOTE]\nI had told you it is a lay mans way to test a barrel condition by putting a bullet from the muzzle end. How ever for those people with no gauges the old soldiers  and experienced hunters /Riflemen did have a method; This is as under:\nTake the Bolt out, Put a bullet in from the muzzle end with a complete  cartridge pushing softly as far as it would go and as straight as possible, then point the rifle towards an illuminated wall not a source of light and  view from the chamber if you see four or six ( as per number of Grooves) leaks of light the muzzle end of the barrel is NOT worn out due to Chord or Rod wear caused by dumb ass cleaning which ruins a barrel more than shooting, but if you see no light or very little light, than the rifle is likely worn out. There should be 4 or 6 prominent gaps from which light should be visible if the barrel is Good. NOTE this is a lay mans Test for one with little experience and no Gauges; this  does tell some tale. It basically means the Lands are good and the Grooves are deep. Worn out lands when too close to the grooves mean a worn barrel. Actually a barrel hardly wears with a few thousand rounds, it is the throat which wears just ahead of the chamber and kills accuracy after 2- 4000 rounds depending on caliber. This bullet method reveals if a rifle muzzle which is critical to accuracy has been damaged by IMPROPER CLEANING. Out of thousands upon thousands of Rifles I have inspected most are damaged by improper cleaning by shoving a rod in a barrel from the Muzzle instead of the Chamber side or pulling a pull through from the Muzzle instead of  from the Chamber side.', ''),

(646306, ' [QUOTE=beretta8;483529]I read in an American reloading blog that fiocchi primers and fiocchi shells are smaller in diameter. It said if you reload with remington or winchester primers (using a fiocchi shells) the diameter of slightly bigger primers will increase  the diameter of primer seat. And then if you tried to reload the same fiocchi shell with a fiocchi primer it might fall out.[/QUOTE]\n\nExternal diameter of shot shells are set to industrial standards world wide. Internal dimensions are determined by the shell manufacturers according to the components they intend to use which meet universal pressure standards. Even shells by the same manufacturer may vary according to the components used. In the past Winchester used a hull called compresion formed, which was made from a single piece of plastic for it''s top line ammunition, whereas it used a different hull made of two pieces of plastic with different components for its lesser quality ammo. There are so many variables in internal volume, component size, and shot size between nations.   . This is why shotshell reloading should only be done using loading manuels provided by powder or shell  \n\nmanufacturers.\n\nRegarding Fiocchi ammo. My experience has been that their primers are slight larger than Remington and Winchester primers. Their use in Fiocchi hulls are a lose fit and will work but I''ve always felt they may allow gas to escape  around the edge of the primer. Conversely, Fiocchi primers are slightly LARGER. They may be forced into Winchester, Remington, and Federal hulls and used, but thereafter only the Fiocchi primers should be used in those cases due to lose fit. \n\nT\nThe above is from my personal experience and may NOT be the same as yours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nberetta8, This is not meant disparage your post but only to show that internet information should be taken with a large grain of salt.', ''),

These devices only reduce recoil and do nothing to reduce the signature of flash of the rifle. The one I am using is the surefire MB556K.\n\nCompensators: These are a balance between recoil reduction and reduced muzzle flash. The standard A2 flash hider of the M4 can be classed as a compensator \n\nFlash hiders: These are only built to reduce muzzle flash and do little or nothing to reduce recoil. An example of this is the noveske KX3 flaming pig. It is usually used in short barrelled ARs to reduce the huge muzzle flash produced by a short barrel. \n\n\nI like muzzle brakes as I dont need to hide from the enemy and dont need to hide the flash of my gun.

Viewed a few threads on same issue and came to the conclusion that retainer can not fire or use the weapon. but with that said no one posted the source of their information. \nSo i googled And read Punjab Arms Rules 2014 (There is no Pakistan Arms Rules because every province has its own Arms Policy) and in the retainer section there is no mention of the rights retainer has. Then searched MOI and Read Latest Arms Policy which is of 2012 and same there is no mention of the rights a retainer has and no mention of what he can or can not do. so my point is for all those who posted and said that a retainer cannot use a weapon i ask all of them what was your source of information ? and i would like to see that with my own disturbed eyes. those threads were 4 to 5 years old so i though i should create a new one.\nAfter all the digging i can see that there is no mention of the rights of a retainer. so if its not mentioned a retainer can legally use that firearm. otherwise they should have mentioned.

In pindi Fazal Sons and Augustra Traders at Hathi Chowk are DSA dealers.', ''),

Owning p.b weapons should be allowed for everyone but the owners should only be allowed to keep them inside safes in government registered gun ranges and/or police stations but no where else .so owners can use them only for recreational use, competitive shooting and target practice only. The Government should increase liscence issuing and renewal fee to finance all the things that I mentioned they can even allow international gun manufacturers to do buisness in Pakistan like they do in the united states. they would be more than willing to help the government finance this as Pakistan has such a large gun market p.s this will bring down prices aswell and will be beneficial to the economy. smuggling ,illegal trade of firearms and using guns for any other purpose except use in ranges and SD/HD should be sternly dealt with.I know my ideas sound to far-fetched considering we live in Pakistan.but imho all these measures will mean that only sane,responsible and law-abiding citizens will be able to keep guns.[/QUOTE]\n\nKudos to You Brother.\ni applaud your sense of understanding.\nCheers', ''),

(646521, ' Great Post. Good Luck with Regulating and implementing this law in practice through police efforts.\n\nThere is a Law in place against discharging a weapon in an urban environment. (Implementation problem)\n\nThe problem is that as a person (Bystander/Observer) witnessing such an  act (of firing a weapon) is so alluring that it makes a person  (witness-er) just stand there and genuflect at the marvelous sight.  whereas we should stand up and start reporting such activity to the  police (at least make an effort). In a developed country like  usa/canada/uk etc people call 911. It is our duty to make stand up and  report such activity before someone gets hurt. As a nation if we dont  want to change how can we help ourselves and be expected to be helped  out. we need to change our attitude as a nation.\n\nThis era (age) of Pakistan is what i tag as the wild west age of  Pakistan. similar to the cowboy/wild west era, where gun ownership was  common, the didn''t help you much (so you had to have a firearm), every  second person could possibly be a robber or a dacoit, people weren''t  that well educated etc. (you are quite familiar with the social problems  of the ear). this is the kind of the same transitions period Pakistan  is going through. and Pakistan will see the dawn of a educated future.\n\n\nIf you speak to illiterate gun owner (my presumption would he doesn''t  have a license) they have a perception that the projectile just vanishes  in mid air and it will not come back to earth. (EDUCATION)/(ILLEGAL GUN  OWNERSHIP). A practice unseen in legal and educated gun owners.\n\nAll accidents (aerial firing) are a result of a very specific firearm,  the pistol. There are hardly any accidents involving long guns. There is  hardly any illegal possession of a long gun (hard to carry and also  conceal). Pistol can be concealed easily and therefore acquired  illegally.  In the 40''S 50''S AND THE 60''S the DC office reserved the  privilege to refuse a citizen to bear a pistol (logic being why do we  have the police and the law in place). Whereas long guns were never  discouraged (hunting sporting etc). \n\nWhy do you think they are making NADRA firearms id cards? To limit gun ownership? TO STOP ILLEGAL GUN OWNERSHIP.\n\nThe government should put a ban on all automatic firearms. \n\nGun ownership in Pakistan is not new. my great grandfather had guns so  did my grandfather whoever; this is a new unique problem which  requires  a different tactile approach. \nPersonally i have stared to believe that the idea of DE-weaponizing the  civilian population must have been ignited by a foreign agent, whose  sole indent is to make sure that the civilian population stays  DE-weaponized; therefore making it easier for the foreign troops to  manage civilians after they have vanquished the armed forced (LOLZ.)', ''),

(646523, ' AoA Guys.\r\n\r\nread somewhere a long time ago: "owning a gun doesn''t make you a murderer anymore than owning a guitar makes your a guitarist".\r\n\r\nHence, we do need to de-weaponize Pakistan of illegal and unregistered firearms. similarly, we also need to abolish MNA and MPA quotas because this quota system of the privileged class only generates ungrateful and irresponsible gun owners.\r\n\r\nin my extremely limited understanding of the subject, introduction of a proper merit based licensing system should be adopted where anybody could get a firearms license regardless of their class or social standing. such a system would definitely ensure that only sound minded and responsible citizens become gun owners.\r\n\r\nas far as merit is concerned, I am no expert but from the top of my mind I can think of a few things on which the merit system should be based on:\r\n\r\n1. sound mindedness (psychological evaluation)\r\na complete psych evaluation. to screen out anyone with suicidal or homicidal or otherwise trouble-cidle tendencies. lols!\r\n\r\n2. background check (police verification)\r\nno previous criminal record, no record of any suspicious activity or no record of any family duels or no known gang or clan associations.\r\n\r\n3. credible reason (in-depth interview by a magistrate)\r\napplicant must give a valid reason. aerial firing on weddings or to show off in front of friends and family are not valid reasons.\r\n\r\n4. Neighbor''s approval (two or more neighbors must approve)\r\nNeighbors must approve and testify of the personal character of the applicant. THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.\r\n\r\n5. Firearm owner''s guarantee (two or more firearms owners must give their personal guarantee)\r\ntwo firearms owners in applicant''s circle must give their personal guarantee that the applicant is a person of sound mind and character. THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.\r\n\r\n6. Educational Qualification (minimum 14yrs of education)\r\na person''s education tells alot about a person. plus an educated firearm owner is a careful firearm owner.\r\n\r\n7. Age Limit (25 yrs or older)\r\nto select mature firearms owners with predictable emotional responses.\r\n\r\n8. Health (physically fit, proper eyesight and whatnot)\r\n\r\n9. Firearms Hazard and Safety Course (conducted by police for applicants)\r\na short course conducted by police to ensure that applicant knows how to operate and safely keep a firearms without injuring anyone else.\r\n\r\n10. legal rights and action course (conducted by district bar association)\r\na short course by district bar association to ensure that applicant knows his legal rights (limits) in various situations involving firearms and how to legally protect himself/herself in the worst case scenario and what best course of action of take in the event of a firearm use.\r\n\r\n11. declaration of source of income / Return Filer\r\nthis will ensure that only those people will get a license whose source of income is documented and they pay their taxes. applicant must have filed returns for the last 5 years without any lapse.\r\n\r\n12. certification from local rifle association\r\nlocal NRA/FRA/PRA/PARA (whichever applicable) must give their recommendation regarding what type of weapon/license applicant deserves or whether applicant doesn''t deserve to have a weapon in the first place.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I am no expert but I think anyone who goes through such a rigorous selection process should be given whatever type of license or weapon he/she desires.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

All automatics perma-banned, bolt actions and single shots + semi autos of .22 lr alongside shotguns in hunting loads ( birdshot or buckshot) on a stage one licence and pistols  and semi auto rifles on a stage two licence ( Slugs for shotguns are also on a stage two licence )\n\nIf we want to curb aerial firing and other stupid acts, plus crimes with licenced weapons, its simple. A mandatory account of every round fired.  You walk in the firing range, your ammo is sorted through a counting machine beforehand and you collect your casings and show them while leaving. You take the same casings to your dealer, he looks at them, he takes them,( after counting via machine ) and allows you to purchase more ammo. Nobody will fire nonsensically anymore after they know they will be arrested the second they try to buy more ammo and cannot show that their casings were fired at a range.\n\nThis requirement can be waived in the case of self defence. \n\nComing up short or failing to provide a account of every round fired is a federal offence, 3 months in prison or 5% of total assets owned value must be given as a fine. \n\nStage one licences and weapons have no real requirement to show ammo casings afterward, as they are pretty much only hunting and plinking weapons. \nstage two, full blown checking of what round fired, where round fired and why round fired.\n\nFinally a tightly strung licencing process. written test + practical test and a one year delay between applying and obtaining the licence. Throw in multiple trips to the offices throughout the year= The harder it is , the less wannabes ( people who arent gun enthusiasts or fearful for their own lives ) will be able to get a firearm.\n\nBut all in all this is nothing but talk.

I am sorry still.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n 3. credible reason (in-depth interview by a magistrate)\r\n applicant must give a valid reason. aerial firing on weddings or to show off in front of friends and family are not valid reasons.\r\n(Totally agree but how hard is to write "protection")\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]brother isn''t protection is a valid reason? to me personal/self protection is a very valid reason and everyone of us is entitled to have some form of "personal protection".\r\n\r\nI can think of couple more reasons for personal protection. I am sure you would agree with most of them if not all. 1. sports 2. collection 3. hunting and so on.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n4. Neighbor''s approval (two or more neighbors must approve)\r\n Neighbors must approve and testify of the personal character of the applicant. THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.\r\n(In india they do someting similar,but all upper caste get licenses) \r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]brother I merely suggested neighbors approval because neighbors usually are well aware of a person''s character, habits, friends and social circle.\r\n\r\nkindly allow me to paint a picture based on your good self as an example. I am sure your neighbors they will gladly approve any firearm ownership request that you may have because of your well respected and honorable status and personality amongst your neighbors. wouldn''t you agree?\r\n[/COLOR]\r\n \r\n5. Firearm owner''s guarantee (two or more firearms owners must give their personal guarantee)\r\n two firearms owners in applicant''s circle must give their personal guarantee that the applicant is a person of sound mind and character. THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.\r\n(Not really as it is not practical.Do you want to go to jail if your buddy decides to fire a few shots in the air or at someone)\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]my dear brother, like I said "it is a tough one". it is indeed difficult. but guess what? I for one, would gladly extend my personal guarantee for your application. would u like to know why?\r\n\r\nbecause I know for certain that you are a responsible person and hence you will be a responsible firearm owner and will prove to be an asset to the gun-community of Pakistan.\r\n[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n 6. Educational Qualification (minimum 14yrs of education)\r\n a person''s education tells alot about a person. plus an educated firearm owner is a careful firearm owner.\r\n(Is my law degree from University of london any less than a PHD from Vehari university?)\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]no brother, it is not a contest of degrees of qualifications. like I said, minimum of 14yrs of education is only to ensure that a person is educated enough to know whats right and wrong.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]ofcourse, I never intended to suggest that one degree is better than other.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n 7.Age Limit (25 yrs or older)to select mature firearms owners with predictable emotional responses.\r\n (Agree with age limit but not the premise)\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]lols! I am glad that you agree with something.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n 8. Health (physically fit, proper eyesight and whatnot)\r\n(Thankfully all doctors in pakistan are honest registered and brimming with morals to make sure that only healthy people own arms)\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]its just a suggestion brother. my intention was merely to suggest that the applicant should be in a reasonable health to operate a firearm. I never suggested that health standards should be equal to a marathon runner. lols![/COLOR]\r\n\r\n 9. Firearms Hazard and Safety Course (conducted by police for applicants)\r\n a short course conducted by police to ensure that applicant knows how to operate and safely keep a firearms without injuring anyone else.\r\n(With 1 policeman per 485 citizen we are already behind curve on what police actually should be doing,i fail to see anything practical happening albeit certification factories running out of every police station)\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]Bro, I for one would certainly opt for such a course if given a chance. its always better when an experienced instructor demonstrates safe firearms handling.\r\n\r\nin our GTGs we have encountered many times that even seasoned firearm owners and shooters do not know how to safely handle a gun or how to handle themselves in a crowd full of gun lovers. lols![/COLOR]\r\n\r\n 10. legal rights and action course (conducted by district bar association)\r\n a short course by district bar association to ensure that applicant knows his legal rights (limits) in various situations involving firearms and how to legally protect himself/herself in the worst case scenario and what best course of action of take in the event of a firearm use.\r\n (Not even remotely possible teaching people how to get away with murder is not actually a good thing)\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]I am sorry, I may not have been able to clear things here. I didn''t mean "how to get away with murder" I only suggested "the right course of action in the event of a firearm discharge".\r\n\r\nmy dear brother, would you not like know what do? who to call? how to arrange a lawyer? in the event you have discharged your firearm in self protection or self defense. in my humble opinion, this type of information is critical for every gun owner.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]brother not everyone is a Law Graduate from "University of London". Majority of us would definitely benefit from a little knowledge of the Law.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n 11. declaration of source of income / Return Filer\r\n this will ensure that only those people will get a license whose source of income is documented and they pay their taxes. applicant must have filed returns for the last 5 years without any lapse.\r\n(Millionaires commit murders too)\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]please don''t confuse gun owner, gun lovers, firearm enthusiasts with murderers bro. its not about how much money you got either. its about documentation of the economy. isn''t it our national responsibility to contribute? . I would urge you not to disagree.[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n 12. certification from local rifle association\r\n local NRA/FRA/PRA/PARA (whichever applicable) must give their recommendation regarding what type of weapon/license applicant deserves or whether applicant doesn''t deserve to have a weapon in the first place.\r\n(How do they know me?)\r\n\r\n[COLOR="#0000FF"]of course brother they don''t know you or me. but a brief interaction is enough to maximize the possibility that the applicant will turn out to be a responsible gun owner.\r\n\r\ntake your good self as an example here. I don''t know you personally but in our interactions here on PG I have come to know that you are a respectable member of our society and a true gun lover. I wouldn''t hesitate for a second if I ever have to vouch for you.\r\n[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n\r\nin the end brother, please understand that any system no matter how fool proof can be fooled by those with means and resolve. however, this doesn''t justify that we get rid of all systems.\r\n\r\nthink of it like this. we all know that there are work arounds (some less than legal and some potentially life threatening) to getting a driver''s license but does that mean we close our eyes and start handing out drivers'' licenses to everyone?\r\n\r\nLike I said, I am pro de-weaponizing but de-weaponizing of illegal and unregistered firearms only.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

You are [I]always[/I] wrong. You are sorry for impinging on their day. You will apologize and apologize again. You [I]will[/I] back the **** down. You [I]will[/I] put your tail between your legs. You [I]will[/I] let them talk shit about your ladyfriend. You [I]will[/I]  let them call your mother a bitch and a whore and your dad a bastard.  You have no ego. " "You do all this because if you are the one to start a fight, by default  that fight now has a gun in it, and if you start losing, you''re going  to pull it and kill him. And even if you don''t go to jail because you  could convince the jury that it was self-defense, you''re going to have  to live with the fact that you could have saved someone''s life and yet  you let your ego kill someone."

Though all of you  [civilians] are better shots than the police, you do not have the  training, the continuum of force policy, or a union plus free lawyers  protecting you if you screw up."\n  ed: He also said: "but after backing down and trying to apologize, if  at any time you then feel your life or that of a loved one is in  danger, put three rounds into his [cardiothoracic] vault, call the  police, give a statement, go home, and sleep like a baby. You did all  you could for your attacker, and he was the one that made the final  decision...\n  ... to kill himself."\n  Cross-post aside; make sure you take the responsibility of carrying a  weapon seriously. All of our rights depend on it. DO NOT give chances  to people when your life is in danger, but DO NOT let your ego, or your  pride kill someone.\n  Edit: returned post to original content.\n  Edit 2: People have been adding that you shouldn''t talk to the police  up front, but should in fact get a lawyer.

If police and LEAs do their jobs with honesty and no political influence, there will be less crime and less use of lethal force. See is you say target killings and crimes in Karachi was due to firearms in civilians hands, what happened now after rangers operation?

A well trained, disciplined and armed civilian is second line of defense, we are deliberately weakened in last decades through sectarian and ethnic violence and differences, terrorism, economic crises and corrupt practices by politicians but only one institution stood in line of fire which are our armed forces and agencies, enemy failed in that regard overtime, but if a weak nation and economy could not stand behind army, how long will they defend us.

Our only aim for our kids is they get top marks (strange craze) and become one making robots, not a good citizen, helpful member of society or a leader.

(647000, ' Dear Friends, as pointed out earlier in thread, only way to legally keep and use radio transceivers/communication is to get membership of PARS Pakistan, study and pass exam and apply for HAM license to PTA. There are exceptions for ISM band, emergency band and family bands spectrum in the world and similar wireless spectrum might be allowed in Pakistan as well. There may also be restrictions on sensitivity of radio receiver/transmitter, output power and encryption is used. Also note that the range written of walkie talkie boxes especially walkabout is exaggerated (similar to audio systems of 5 watt but marketed as 500watts pump I remember in early 1990s). As mentioned by friends earlier, range i depending on many factors like building or mountains, line of sight availability, device of antenna height from surface of earth and type of antenna etc. As we knew (in hobby electronics) that 100 feet range (for experimentation and study) is allowed for say FM transmitters etc.\n\n[url]http://www.pakhams.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=75&Itemid=92[/url]\n\nAfter obtaining license you may have any of these devices;\n[url]http://www.eham.net/reviews/products/49[/url]\n\nThere are several unusual devices for alternate communication (just in case scenario) for example for $150 you will get a couple of GoTenna devices using these with smartphonne you can text each other on secure channel ([url]http://www.gotenna.com[/url]).\nAnother work in progress is Beartooth ([url]http://www.beartooth.com/#about[/url]) which will be available in last quarter of 2015.\nFirechat is used for anonymous communications in SEA & ME during protests and now they are making it point to point as well ([url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireChat[/url]).\n\nAnother work in progress is MeetEarl ([url]http://www.meetearl.com[/url]) but it might take a year more to produce, has walkie talkie, weather radio, GPS, solar panel and much more, a wanted toy for survivalists like me.\n\nAnother workaround is to get a cellphone with builtin walkie talkie such as snopow [url]http://www.snopow.com/plus/view.php?aid=18[/url] or Runbo [url]http://www.runbo.net[/url] having that with HAM license MIGHT give you Plausible deniability option.\n\nThis 2c is for emergency and disaster (Survival scenario) only and not intended to everyday use.

He sent it for 144 permit. A few FIA chaps were in the Section Office (arms). Home department. They claimed it was fake and proved it as well. Made a file.. To cut a long story short. we had to use all our influence and money to get the kid of the hook.  Every DC has the right to issue only 50 licenses per month. And the person has to be a resedent of that area. I.e the specific district. \n\nWhat they do is use a temporary fake address for the license and then insert the original address in the CNIC as permanent. Or vice versa.  Soooo unless you are a resident of Qambhar, or have a domicile of that area or are in that district''s voter''s list or have a temporary address there. Fake data must have been used. And the same S.O ( arms) DC Qamnhar is sent the verification letter from the NADRA office which he duly verifies. \n\nBut if there is an actual scrutiny.. Then there is a world of trouble.   During the airport attack in Karachi. Licensed fire arms were used and at least one Qambhar license was found from the scene of the crime. The media made a lot of noise bout it and a through scrutiny was promised. \n\ni sincerely hope you are from district Qambhar itself. So there would be no falsification of data.', ''),

(647135, '&quot;Business as usual&quot; at the Zila Katcheri office Arrived at Lahore Zila Katcheri at 8 am today. I was the 31st person there. A man who had arrived there at 3:30 am today was the first man in line. This man had also created an attendance sheet that noted the names of the applicants. This way we would not have the mad rush to obliterate everyone in our paths when the tokens for service in the office upstairs would begin. Little did we know what sort of idiocy awaited us.\n\nAs the crowd grew and it got close to 8:30 am (which is when the tokens are usually distributed), we queued up at the token counter. We checked the person in front of us and behind us to make sure that no one was cutting into the line. While the majority of us was acting in an organized and civilized manner we noticed that there were lawyers (in the usual uniform of the black suit-coat, white shirt and black tie) walking right past us and up to the jangla gate at the head of the stairs. We counted about 6 lawyers proceed directly up to the office (singly). They were treated as VIP''s by the guard at the jangla gate, and admitted quickly. \n\nBy 9:30 am no one had arrived at the token counter downstairs to distribute the day''s tokens to any of us waiting in line. We asked some of the elders among us to go inquire upstairs about the reason for the delay. 3 of the older, cooler and more respectable looking ones among us went upstairs one by one to inquire. They were turned away abruptly at the jangla gate without any explanation other than "the office is not open yet". At the same time we could look into the glass windows and see for ourselves that the upstairs office was fully manned, lit up, air-conditioned and in motion. Everything was there, except us "customers". Apparently the boss at this office is a woman; the lawyers (and later other sifarishis) would all ask the same secret code question "Kya bibi daftar main hain?" The guard would then quickly allow them inside the jangla. We also saw at least 5 people enter the office through a corridor opposite the jangla gate.\n\nAround 9:45 am the crowd waiting downstairs became restless and began to go up to the jangla gate in groups and started to complain to the guard. The guard finally admitted that the computer system was still not functional today (the 4th day). As the mood of the crowd began to turn ugly we saw a young man carry up 2 dell desktop computers to the office past us. He said that he was here to replace the dysfunctional computers. We were all relieved and cheered up.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes the computer technician left, telling us that the computer system was now functional. We then continued to wait.... and wait... and wait. An older man began to threaten the staff upstairs and downstairs that he was going to file a case against the office staff for not working; after all this was the zila katcheri wasn''t it? so this would be the ideal place to file a case, no?\n\nThe rest of us tried to cool him down and he began to threaten us as well. We left him alone after that. The last we saw of him was when he was threatening to have a policeman fired. The policeman was in elite squad uniform and looked rather dazed and confused at being suddenly attacked by this angry old man. He kept his cool and just let the old man rant and rave at him.\n\nA vendor appeared several times and sold us overpriced cold drinks and bottled water. By this time some of the young men in line had begun calling the NADRA helpline to complain about the staff relaxing inside the chilly office while we were melting like candles outside. NADRA seems to know when things are not going well; none of the calls were being answered. Maybe that''s just normal with NADRA; I don''t have enough experience with them to know if this is just how they work. The frustrated phone callers began taking out their frustrations on the guard, the sifarishis and the lawyers that were still hovering around us like so many black and white dengue mosquitos. The lawyers must have received training from NADRA because not a single one of them answered us, they simply faded away from the crowd as quickly and discreetly as they could.\n\nAt around 10:20 am a mature man pushed his way into the office after one of the sifarishis. He went straight past the chit-chatting staff at the front row of desks and right to the service window in the back of the room. We couldn''t hear him through the glass windows, but we could see him speaking and gesturing forcefully at the staffer at the window. We could also see the staffer gesturing equally forcefully at the gentleman, and then waving him out of the office.\n\nThe man who had forced his way in came out and told us that the computer system had been restored... for 10 minutes. After that the office staff had managed to somehow wipe the data for the applicants of the last few days. The staff was now trying to restore the lost data, before they entered any new data for the applicants present today. When would the data be restored? No one in the office knew. Should we wait? No one knew. Should we return tomorrow? No one knew. \n\nLessons learned: go early, make an attendance list, broker an agreement that all present would enforce the queue discipline, question the office staff repeatedly about the work-status of the office, share information with others waiting along with you, take some cold drinks with you and share them with others, don''t get angry, complain to NADRA (but not through their helpline), don''t believe the signs outside that say "agents will not be entertained here", expect "VIP" guests (lawyers, agents and other sifarishis), expect to be met with silence from the office staffers.\n\nBy the way, I learned today that if your license was issued in Lahore and your NIC has a Lahore city address you can apply for the card license at about 8 or 9 other NADRA offices scattered around Lahore. If your license was not issued in Punjab outside Lahore you must come to the Zila Katcheri. If neither of your 2 addresses on your NIC is for Lahore city you must come to the Zila Katcheri.\n\nYou''ll see a big red sign claiming that you can apply at any NADRA office in Lahore; don''t believe that sign.\n\nYesterday I was told that the application date was extended to August 31st for Punjab provincial licenses, and that this info was posted on a bulletin board outside the office. I didn''t see any such notification at the office today.\n\nI will go back tomorrow or day after. Wish me success. Pray for NADRA, the office staff and the recovery of the lost data.', ''),

Before you start off with the restoration, an important decision at your end should be as to how much would you want to restore it, i.e. only the wooden furniture; the metal parts or both?? If you opt for complete restoration, remember that even in that case you will have to decide if the dents in the metal and wood needs to be removed or left in there.

Except for Pakistan Ordinance Factory Wah, no other business entrepreneur in the country is legally authorized to manufacture / sell PB weapons. Therefore, many of the PB licences holders resort to the unauthorized practice of getting PB weapon in the form of gift from tribal people / authorities.

There is long list of what and how information can be accessed/steeled including network leaks, OS backdoors, key loggers, trojans, spyware etc and sophisticated softwares that using network/internet/gsm/gprs/emails are loaded in your pc/device and monitor all activities and access al information. Even a hard drive data on disconnected PC is accessible remotely. We voluntarily surrender/compromise our personal information like contacts, messages and communication (whatsapp, Facebook, skype), family/friends and relationships (social media), profiles (linked), private info on smart devices (android and iOS apps), photos and videos (cloud and social media) etc. even our fingerprints (IPhone 5s+), writing and typing style and recognition (iOS/Android), voice samples (siri etc) and even gestures and location (what we were doing, where we visited and who was there at the time) is shared by us. All of this information is being profiled (better than NADRA on super computers and Big Data systems), some is sold to corporates for data analysis, marketing, and some to government institutions for strategic planning, analysis and regional/community manipulation. BUT most part of it is being analyzed and achieved for future use to control and manipulate our children and their so that the system (like matrix/N S A) would even be able to recognize anyone just by any trace, trait or gesture. Looks like conspiracy theory or exaggeration! no it is not.\n\nOne should not be afraid of government of country one lives or citizen of, and one should have nothing to hide from, but other countries, corporates and agencies are after your data and identity so if we care of our freedom and privacy we should read/ research and act.\n\nMy suggestion is go for open source audited solutions. \nLinux on vm + full encrypted drives ()+ OS/Data on separate drives+search engine like duckduckgo+browser like firefox with security settings and plugins+use of good VPN. Please visit and read securityinabox.org/en for better security and privacy guidelines.[/QUOTE]\n\ncent per cent correct, this is indeed not a conspiracy theory. The VPN websites like hotspot etc are not safe either. they can blind the hackers by switching the ip numbers etc but they also share your personal info like all you mentioned and search history with govt corporates and intellegence agencies, in russia google is banned they have there own state owned search engine. This statement is correct for western countries i read it some where that "Google knows all about a child before parents does" see everybody searches info for concerning issue on the internet specificaly google first before talking to some physical person. same goes with facebook. many dont realise this yet but we are living in an era of psycological warfare. control the litterature and you will control what the people think. control the mind and you will control the people........', ''),

Is there any action taken you or is there any provision that you can pay a fine and get license?\n\nI think the best way forward would be just be to sit quietly and wait for the license ban to be lifted. it may take a year or so. meanwhile dont use/carry your gun.\n\nIs there any way I can still get a computerized booklet or something? I remember seeing banners a few years ago about June2010 licenses being fake but I didn''t bother checking my license for this.[/QUOTE]\n\nI''ve submitted my manual license of 2010. Received message about submission. I''ve heard that a committee Chairing by Rana Sanaullah (Law Minister) will make their decision about fake licenses. I think they will legalize them .', ''),

Chocking of shotgun is in last 3-4 inches of barrel. Based on these facts a 24" barrel is excellent for quail shooting, anything longer is a matter of personal preference. I have loved using 24" barrel on quail with excellent results. Longer barrel means more weight which can be handy in reducing recoil, a must where lot of shooting is to be done within one session. Similarly longer barrel helps in improving the swing and is particularly useful for high flying ducks', ''),

For me either its a 26" or 28"\nThose who suggest barrel length is discarded where chokes play more important role, A 28" barrel with a full choke will have a longer uniform tight pattern lets say at about 50yards more than 80% pellets will be in a 30inch circle, but a 24" barrel with Full choke would only deliver 50-60% pellets at the 30inch circle at 50yards. \nThe above stated is only for learning purpose and not actual figures.\nIt''s better to get a 26 or 28" barrel and enjoy most of the games you can with a shotgun than getting a 24" and restricting yourself to a few.The longer barrel will have better swing and will ultimately give you more command over the gun.', ''),

(647465, 'Common Question: Which 22LR Rifle Should I Buy? Many newcomers to 22LR ask time and again - which rifle should I buy?  I cannot decide for others. But, if I was in the market for one, I would go for a bolt action over other types - semi-auto, pump or lever action. Bolt action rifles have stood the test of time. They are very reliable. They retain their value over long periods. You can buy one today - use it for a decade or longer and then sell for more than what paid for it! The accuracy of the 452s is legendary.\n \nCertain bolt actions that are my favorites are no longer in production. The most recent rifles in this class are the several CZ 452 variants that include the American, FS, Lux, Scout, Silhouette, Style, Trainer, Ultra Lux and Varmint.   The 452 has been superseded by the CZ 455. Now and then you may be able to locate new ones in some stores. Don''t hesitate to buy a used one if new one is not available or is out of reach for your pocketbook.  Many old-timers like me prefer the 452 over 455.

Anyways your licness might not be in the list of fake licneses. Cause I know some people having licnese of 2009 and they are renewing them even giving it for computrization. So do 2 things. Try to find out the list of fake licneses. The list that contains serial numbers of the licenses. Second goto post office and tell them that this licnese is original and not in the fake license list and get it renewed. Or you can visit the arms branch and ask them if this license is original or fake[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice. I shall have my license checked again by the arms branch. According to a source, DCOs had the authority to issue 30 licenses in a month at that time. So how can it only be a tickets issue if they issued 12000 licenses in a year? Anyways whatever the issue was, it was a big blunder on Govt''s behalf and sends a very clear message to everyone aspiring to be a gun owner. I hope you understand what I mean:)', ''),

All claims should be made through the TPA." [/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#363636][FONT=Georgia]As of early 2013 the nine models were no longer manufactured and distributed in the United States. The company is headquartered in Brazil, but it has operations in Miami.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#363636][FONT=Georgia]A federal judge in Miami on Thursday preliminarily approved the settlement that calls basically for Taurus to do three things for customers:\n[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[LIST]\n[*]\n[*]Provide an enhanced warranty to allow any owner &#8211; even if it isn''t the original owner and for the life of the pistol &#8211; to submit the handgun for inspection and repair, if possible. If the defects can''t be repaired Taurus will offer to replace the pistol with a similar new one. Normal inspection and shipping fees and labor costs will be waived.\n[*]Produce on-line safety training videos for those customers who bought the pistols to show them how to handle and carry the pistols to avoid dropping them and how to ship them for warranty repairs.\n[*]Allow customers who bought the pistols to send their pistols back for cash payments.

(647770, 'A Sensible Approach to Gun Laws in Pakistan Salams,\n\nI''ve been away for a while but watching things progressing in the background. It seems every week there is a new statement about gun laws in Pakistan. Revalidation, Cancellation, Limitation or some other "ation". It will never work. If the Government is really serious then we need a sensible and workable framework which addresses the genuine concerns of the Gun Community of Pakistan and solves the genuine security concerns of the Establishment. Some things have to be said clearly and in point form on behalf of the Gun Community of Pakistan.\n\n1). We [B]are [/B]Pakistan. \n2). Disarming us the citizens will only weaken the country.\n3). We don''t want to be disarmed.\n4). We wish to be legal and law abiding citizens of Pakistan. Don''t make laws which force us to break them.\n5). Don''t take away or limit our right to protect our homes, businesses and families.\n6). Firearms run in Pakistani blood. It is our culture.\n7). An armed and trained population is a country''s greatest strategic asset (Ref Switzerland). In case of any shortcoming in the armed forces they become the resistance. \n8). Legal Firearms owning citizens of the country are [B]not [/B]terrorists or potential terrorists. They are the greatest deterrence [B]to [/B]terrorists. \n[CENTER]\n\n[/CENTER]\nNow as for [B]the solution,[/B] let me give that in point form as well for clarity. \n\n1). All weapons in Pakistan must be registered and computerised. \n\n2). No new licenses should be issued without a training program modelled on the Canadian Firearms Safety Course (CFSC).\n\n3). One License should be issued which is for the [B][I]PERSON [/I][/B]and not the [B][I]FIREARM[/I][/B].\n\n4). The Citizen should be able to buy [B]any [/B]number of Firearms on the license which is issued to his PERSON.\n\n5). [B][U]The purchase of Firearms should be as follows: [/U][/B]\n\na). Every Firearms Dealer should have a computer which logs into "A Firearm Dealer Database". On that database the dealer should be obligated to keep an inventory of all firearms in their inventory.  \n\nb). When a customer with a PERSONAL Firearms licence walks in. He should ask for his PERSONAL license, verify it''s authenticity in the online database by entering the License number or swiping his card. Once verified the license is genuine he can sell the firearm to the license holder and transfer the firearm from the online dealer inventory to the customers PERSONAL license. A photo can be taken via webcam which verifies the person at point of sale and attached to record. This is the most secure form of transaction. \n\nc). A customer selling a Firearm can do the same process in reverse. Ie Firearm owner walks in with the gun, sells it to the dealer who transfers it from the online database to his dealer inventory and gives the seller a receipt which only prints from the online database saying it has been transferred to them. \n\nd). The benefits of it are, ownership of firearm is firmly established. Government keeps a track of sales for Tax purposes. There is no need for DCO stamps or touts which offer to get things done for you underhand. All three parties, the Government, the Firearms Dealers and the Firearms Owners would directly connect in a ''FAST, NEAT & CLEAN'' dealing. \n\n6). When an Arms Holder is stopped at a Security Check point, the official can simply get his thumbprint and verify if he/she is indeed the owner of the weapon being carried. \n\n7). Dealers should be allowed [B]FREE IMPORT [/B]instead of QUOTA''S which is a very inefficient & corrupt system. It only encourages under invoicing, smuggling and black marketeering. The Quota system is an obsolete system in today''s free market economies and only used in the past to dole out favours to the courtiers of the elite. It is [B]not [/B]in the interest of Citizens of Pakistan. \n\n8). Government should actively negotiate with the European Union and the US to allow free export of non automatic firearms to Pakistan. The problem has always been end user certification and the small arms falling in the hands of criminal outfits but the new system does away with those issues as the same countries have no problem selling firearms to Pakistani armed and security forces. [U]Please make those countries stop thinking the entire population of Pakistan is criminal.[/U] \n\nThe number of arms sold in Pakistan remains the same, only difference is we are shooting Chinese, Brazilian and Russian guns instead of European and American ones. If used in a crime a firearm works the same regardless of which country it is manufactured at. That is not to say American or European small arms are not available in the market. They are flooded with them infact, the only difference is that middle men, smugglers and black marketeers are pocketing the money which belongs to the Citizens and the Government of Pakistan. If for example the Government negotiates with the US to allow export of firearms then a Glock which sells for Rs. 300,000 ($3000 USD) can be bought at $450 USD, have $100 of misc expenses to transport to Pakistan and after paying a 100% duty (450x2=900) be sold in the market legally for Rs. 900+100+20(dealer profit) for Rs. 120,000 ($1200). That''s Rs. 45000 per gun that goes into the National Exchequer and Rs. 180,000 the Firearm Owner saves in money which he would have paid to a BLACK MARKETEER / SMUGGLER who is much more likely to be a criminal. \n\n9). Banning weapons or issuing a call for a mass cancellation of licenses will not be in the interest of the Government of Pakistan nor the People of Pakistan. That would only result in making millions of weapons ILLEGAL and people holding them Criminals. Is that the aim of the Government, to make hundreds of thousands of LAW ABIDING Citizens Criminals by the stoke of a Pen ?\n\nI would like to request the Government to please approach this in a sensible manner which is in the interest of all parties. Gun laws need [B]a completely new framework[/B] in Pakistan. These quick fixes will only have negative results. \n\n[B]\n@All\n\n[/B]This is just a first draft which I only wrote because I saw no one else was coming forward. Please feel free to share your suggestions. Also I would request that since this is something which is very close to our hearts and extremely important to us[B] please share with as many people who you think can help with this or are concerned with this.

(647812, ' Assalam alaikum everyone. It''s great to be writing to my favorite forum for the past six ought years.\n\nThe largest flaw I feel with our licensing legislation scenario is the outdated methodology of the license document itself. While MoI has made efforts to computerize the records, they create newer catches that become a problem later on; I say this with reference to the separate endorsement paper that is provided with each card renewal to act as a record of purchases etc. while no record of anything is on the license itself or gets posted to a database. I know cases where people have abused this to their heart''s content.\n\nIn addition to the input from everyone, I''d like to present a slightly different solution - decouple the license, the property book and the file of the weapon altogether, same as we do for cars.\n\nThat way, the documents confirming the legality of the weapon along with documents highlighting the order, the shipment and duties would be kept in one place and traceable to it''s own serial number. The property book on the other hand would keep basic details of the weapon as well as tying them to a license.\n\nThis way, the endorsements can remain in a bound form in a property book and the next owner would know how much a weapon has been used and know who the previous owner was. The transfer of ownership and renewal etc can be done by DMV like authority to see how many weapons are there on a license (if a limit is implemented). The license stays and the property book and file go for alteration. Simple. Put in a stamp paper somewhere in between if you must.\n\nI think this would add a lot of transparency to the process.\n\nIn all honesty, if the government outsourced the record keeping to a private bank (I am sure everyone here knows the new year hassle that comes with National Banks and GoS books) that has access to the NADRA database, things would be in much better order.', ''),

(647782, ' Dear Abass, Thanks for contacting and initiating this valuable thread,\n\nIn April 2015, I brainstormed some recommendations and sent to MoI. I would like to contribute the same to this thread.\n\nFirearm Regulatory Reforms Recommendations for MOI by NAS/Survivalist April 2015:\nIssues & Problems:\n1.	Fake licenses due to inefficient data entry, storage and retrieval systems.\n2.	No mandatory pre-issuance SoPs or ID cross check. \n3.	Untraceable fired bullets until firearm is captured, as there is no record of licensed firearm bullet and spent cartridge marks. \n4.	Firearm Smuggling (buyers willing to pay high prices for firearms not available)\n5.	Fake firearm copies made locally for hunting/ sport purposes.) \n6.	Tax evasion, as firearm sold for a million rupee is recorded as 20,000 only.\n7.	No checks on how (through what means) foreign made firearms  imported/purchased and no track record of change of ownership.\n8.	Illegal Import & Trade, through changing of papers, records and paying bribe at every stage.\n9.	Current law and policy has grey areas, gaps and implementation issues, such as maximum allowed caliber for handguns is 44 inch, it is larger than the diameter of largest gun/tank on earth. It should be 44 Bore instead. Policy makers do not understand difference between bore, its equivalent in mm and differences. Similarly .22 caliber is a group of calibers that includes smallest (.22 short and long rifle bullet) to .223 (a larger bullet for hunting and 5.56 for military use as well) as well.\n10.	Incapacity and capability (in "arms branches" at DCO offices) of keeping and maintaining record, reviewing applications and examining eligibility of applicant for license of firearm. This leads to backdoors and corruption. One can obtain an arms license much easier than a driving license.\n11.	Situation is better at record keeping and issuing licenses after involvement of NADRA but authorization process is still doubtful.\n12.	Firearm regulations do not include written specifications for the lawful safe storage of private firearms and ammunition by licensed gun owners as part of the licensing process. T\n\n\nFirearms Policy Reforms and Recommendations\n\n1.	A provincial board/independent oganization with district level presence should be established to develop firearm licensing and control policy, strategy and guidelines and implementation thereof. \n\n2.	Board /organization to have representation from armed forces (firearm and shooting sports experts), NADRA, PITB, civil society, hunting community, shooting sportsmen, businessmen and firing range handlers.\n\n3.	A stringent criteria / procedure  be introduced for issuing arms licenses;\na.	Applicant should be examined psychologically.\nb.	Character certificate and police report should be made mandatory.\nc.	Applicant should pass an exam and interview related to firearm safety, handling & storage precautions and use of firearm as well as awareness regarding prevailing law for hunting, shooting sports, carrying firearms and use of firearms for in-house, in-vehicle and personal self-defense.\n\n4.	A system and software  to acquire fired bullet projectile from firearm (that applicant purchased from vendor), scan projectile and spent case for signature marks of firearm and store in database, should be developed and implemented. (A patent application pending in USPTO in this regard)\n\n5.	Above mentioned system will serve as reference point and database for law enforcement and criminal investigation agencies for detection of firearm if a licensed firearm is used in an incident or crime.\n\n6.	Licenses should be categorized as follows;\n \na.	Hunting Sports\nb.	Shooting Sports\nc.	Enthusiast\nd.	Self Defense\ne.	Special Needs\nf.	Security Agency\n \n\n7.	A proof for para 6 claim from applicant should be provided, for example membership card of firing range, membership of hunting sports organization, hunting license, recommendations for amateurs from two existing  members etc.\n\n8.	A database of hunters  be maintained by the licensing wildlife department and shooting sportsmen by shooting sports organizations.\n\n9.	Following are recommendations for firearms for which licenses should be allowed;\n\na.	All shotguns except &#8220;FULL AUTO&#8221; allowed as full auto shotgun is not meant for any sports or self-defense purpose.\nb.	All handguns of any caliber except &#8220;FULL AUTO&#8221; for same reason as above.\nc.	All rifles of .17, .22 (Types: Short, Long Rifle & Magnum) calibers.\nd.	Rifles for hunting purpose only for all caliber up to (.336 bore or 8mm) with magazine capacity of &#8220;8 Bullets maximum&#8221; except &#8220;FULL AUTO&#8221;. Please note that most full auto or military firearms have more than 8 (usually 20 or 30) bullets magazines.\ne.	Para 9(d) firearms/rifles common calibers are .223, .243, .270, .300, .308, 30-06, .336, 5.56 mm, 7mm, 8mm.\nf.	All pneumatic/air/CO2 pistols and guns should be license free. These are commonly called Air Guns or Air Rifles.\ng.	Cartridge purchase limit should be 500 for shooting sports and 50 for others. While limit to keep any time should be 10000 for sportsmen and 500 for others. Please note that usually sportsmen shoot 200 to 500 rounds for practice in one session or day. These statistic can be verified from any range master (Lahore Rifle Club, Wah/Shaheen Shooting Range or Guns Club, Islamabad). These sportsmen earn fame and medals for our country.\nh.	Hunting & Sports firearms should be kept secure and locked at homes or storage location and department/office should be pre-informed of the location and arrangement. \ni.	Shooting a hunting or sports firearm within municipal/city area should be completely prohibited for any purpose except use at firing ranges.\nj.	All shooting for "joy and celebration/ shooting in air" should be totally prohibited and punishable by law. \nk.	SPECIAL CATEGORY (currently it is called &#8220;prohibited&#8221; that is misleading as licenses are issued as PB) should include following;\ni.	Pakistan Ordinance Factory (POF) has designed and manufacturing a range of firearms in 9mm and 308 sporting calibers. There should be an arrangement with POF to allow public sales and licenses for these firearms. This will help eradicate arms smuggling, illegal trade and fake licensing business and boost our economy as well as feel us proud to own firearm made by national company. \nii.	POF can be asked to include .223/5.56 hunting and sports caliber in production range. These firearms should not be &#8220;FULL AUTO&#8221;.\niii.	Only POF made .223 &#8220;NOT FULL AUTO&#8221; with 20 round magazine should be available to masses as a SPECIAL CATEGORY weapon.\niv.	This should only be licensed to retired or in service military or civilian servicemen and women, security agencies, engineers, doctors, teachers/professors, IT professionals, expatriates, scientists, agriculturists, highly qualified persons and tax-payers (with a certain minimum limit).\nl.	 Awareness should be created regarding types and categories of firearms and cartridges. It is to be noted that even those who make policy or implement it are not well aware of various types and uses of firearms and their bullets.\nm.	Firearm traders and shopkeepers should be scrutinized and a software application should be made in which they record all purchases/sales and corresponding information promptly in real time (like NADRA system upload).\nn.	All FULL AUTO weapons should be made prohibited (No license should be issued to ANYONE in any category). Firearm used by our military/security forces including AK-47 (Kalashnikov), HK G3 and MP5 (full auto) should be banned for possession of civilians. As well as anti-material, anti bullet proof (armour piercing) or incendiary bullets be made non accessible and prohibited for civilian use.\no.	A guidebook of firearms, their safety precautions, governing laws and rules, exam sample and contacts should be published and made mandatory for every firearm holder. \np.	Manual of firearm should be produced by applicant as mandatory and scanned and recorded by department/concerned office.\nq.	Change/modification of weapons/firearms to FULL AUTO mode by any means should be completely prohibited.\nSome quick facts in this regard are also of interest;\n1.	7mm and 7.62 are different calibers and even 7.62 comprises various calibers (like 7.62x39 i.e. Kalashnikov, 7.62x51 (military G3 or civil 308, 7.62x54 is popular hunting cartridge).\n2.	308 is civilian version of 7.62x51 military cartridge used in G3.\n3.	POF is making very good quality and product range of civilian use/sporting firearms, even it exports to USA and western countries. We should benefit from POF by allowing sales to our own country/civilians.\n4.	Pakguns.com is an excellent enthusiast community with highly experienced and regarded moderators/senior members of military, hunting and shooting sports origin. It has thousands members and increasing.\n5.	Some glock pistols and imported 222/223 rifles can be modified to full auto and thereby falling in prohibited category. POF has made it impossible for their guns to be reverted to FULL AUTO.\n6.	Sportsmen earn fame and repute for the country and its citizens. They should be allowed to import (through Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Commerce) firearm (say 5 in a lifetime) of their choice from abroad without tax and duties through quick mechanism, no bribery and hurdles.\n7.	Firearm suppressors (commonly called silencers) should be explicitly banned for any firearm except .22 caliber. This .22 caliber is used for sporting and at ranges and suppressors keep these quiet.', ''),

There should be Training centres which allow even a lay man to get proper gun use and gun safety education, as you have mentioned in point 2 of solutions.\n\nThis policy of shut-down of things which the government is unable to control is not new.\nRemember ''Basant Festival'' and ''Food Street'' in Lahore? Just because the Government was incompetent to control the problems that were being generated, their response was shut it down ''Entirely''.', ''),

(647861, ' I have a foreign perspective only.\n\nIndiana as a state has no restrictions on ownership of firearms. Many other states do to varying degrees.\n\nA license to carry a firearm is available in four year or lifetime options. Our license is recognized by 30 other states, although we recognize any license from anywhere (even yours, if you visit us).\n\nFive states do not require any licensing.\n\nMost states require training for a license to carry. We do not.  It''s up to the individual to decide how much training they need.  Some states recognize military service as training, some don''t.  Our crime rate is below the national average. This is not to say this is the deciding factor--there are many.\n\nFederal law requires that people engaging in the BUSINESS of selling firearms must conduct a computerized background check of a buyer.  Private citizens may sell weapons face to face without this.  (Some states have laws against this).\n\n18 year olds may buy long guns, 21 years or older for handguns, though family may transfer handguns to 18 year old relatives.\n\nGuns being sold across state lines must go through a dealer in the receiving state.\n\nThe Federal government and most states do not register firearms.\n\nFederal law requires class III weapons (Rifles with barrels under 16", shotguns with barrels under 18", "non-sporting" calibers over .50, silencers and full auto must go through a special dealer with a $200 transfer tax. Our state imposes no additional restrictions.\n\nWe have a combination of state and federal laws, and a constitutionally enumerated right to own weapons, recently determined by the Supreme Court, and still being resolved in the finer points.\n\nI have no idea if any of this is useful for your debate, but I offer it for information.\n\nGood luck, and Assalam u allaikam.', ''),

After all, you don''t need a training course to teach you how to exercise your right to free speech or life & liberty.\n\n2) [B]ONLY[/B] automatic/select-fire weapons should be licensed; all semi-auto weapons, irrespective of caliber, barrel length, magazine capacity, action, etc. should [B]NOT[/B] require any licenses.

For two reasons; first, if we allow the government to regulate a [B]right[/B] by licensing it then it no longer remains a right and, instead, becomes a [B]privilege [/B](which, by its very definition, can be revoked at the whim of those in power), and second, history is full of examples where firearm registration has almost [B]always[/B] led to firearm confiscation.\n\nTherefore, since I have the natural and unalienable [B]RIGHT[/B] to protect myself, my home and my family, a right which does not stem from any worldly authority nor requires a legislative piece of paper for validation, thus I do not need the government''s permission or regulation in order to exercise my right.

(647893, ' [QUOTE=zainulabdeen;485541]it is next to impossible , in my opinion, to judge by inspecting a gun visually , and that too not for long time, and to say whether or not , this particular gun is chambered in 223 or 55.6 or to form opinion that the gun would eat up the green tips or not. We have to rely upon what ever is written on the gun itself and it says "223". \n\nBut every gun made in these days which says it is chambered in 223 ,shall handle 5.56 also and specially we should not have doubt in  a chinese 223 that it wont handle 5.56 .

(647904, ' Self defense is natural right BUT to defend that your actions was in self defense in court of law have requirements and implications. Than there is question of law abiding and criminals. If there is no registration of firearms (semi-auto etc), how can LEA trace/track to whom a weapon belongs which was used in a crime. Again there will be question of ownership, how can you claim a weapon is yours if it is unregistered? Also liberty and freedom has its own boundaries, otherwise it would be a Might is Right society and chaos everywhere. Remember the government is the people we select from among ourselves to do what actually is our responsibility, e.g. develop my streets, control crime, provide health facilities etc etc. \r\n\r\nTraining in question is like knowledge how to defend yourself, handle your tools and weapons. Why armies spent billions on ammo to train their soldiers on small firearms if we would have natural born ability to recognize, handle and use any weapon at hand in instant? Knowledge, skill and experience is what makes the difference between you and your opponent with similar tools, a thin line between life and death, defeat and success.\r\n\r\nHow many incidents we witness in life and read every other day of a newbie handling a firearm discharge unintentionally and injures someone? And without training in real life incident, many of us like myself when face a handgun cocked in a short tempered opponent (criminal/snatcher) shiver and feel like we are facing a tiger or cobra and paralyzed for most critical and reactive moments...\r\n\r\n[QUOTE=Ahnab;485537]OK, I''m going to wade in with a couple of extreme views (feel free to disagree, but this is just my personal opinion):\r\n\r\n1) If we claim that the ability to defend oneself is a natural right, then demanding that a person be trained in using that right is pretty contradictory. After all, you don''t need a training course to teach you how to exercise your right to free speech or life & liberty.\r\n\r\n2) [B]ONLY[/B] automatic/select-fire weapons should be licensed; all semi-auto weapons, irrespective of caliber, barrel length, magazine capacity, action, etc. should [B]NOT[/B] require any licenses. Why? For two reasons; first, if we allow the government to regulate a [B]right[/B] by licensing it then it no longer remains a right and, instead, becomes a [B]privilege [/B](which, by its very definition, can be revoked at the whim of those in power), and second, history is full of examples where firearm registration has almost [B]always[/B] led to firearm confiscation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since I have the natural and unalienable [B]RIGHT[/B] to protect myself, my home and my family, a right which does not stem from any worldly authority nor requires a legislative piece of paper for validation, thus I do not need the government''s permission or regulation in order to exercise my right. That being said, I''m a supporter of conceal and even open-carry by lawful citizens.\r\n\r\nHowever, being a realist and looking at how such a Pakistan would certainly never be allowed to exist, I can only dream.

It wasn&#8217;t  the droning of generators in the occasional house or the new trend of  lego-block flats towering over smaller housing plots.\nIt was a &#8220;[I]click[/I]&#8221;; an insistent sound coupled with the voice of children.\nEvery  corner I turned, I heard it one after the other &#8211; this clicking sound  was occasionally followed by the complaint of a kid who had been ''hit''.  In the short walks on these streets, I noticed more replica guns than I  had seen in real, just about everywhere.\nI could swear I saw every next kid on that street with a &#8220;[I]charray[/I]&#8221; (pellet) pistol in his hand, firing away &#8211; [I]click! click! click![/I]  As I dodged the occasional misfire, I was struck by this show of  blatant disregard for life &#8211; a lack of compassion and empathy passed on  from parent, teacher, society to child. \nWe, ourselves, are encouraging a gun culture around us. And yet, we complain about it with a staggering hypocrisy. \nI  cannot recall seeing such sophisticated toy guns before. It was one  thing to play &#8216;cowboys and Indians&#8217; with rainbow-coloured plastic toys  or pump-action water guns. But these real-looking military-like guns in  the hands of our children must not be taken lightly. \nEarlier this year, [URL="http://www.dawn.com/news/1189965"]two young boys were shot at[/URL]  (one of whom died) while taking a selfie with a toy gun by a  trigger-happy police in Punjab. The bitter irony of this tragic incident  epitomised a sickness that the closeness to guns can bring on a  society. \nThe boys were fond of replica guns, the police mistook  them for real ones and shot them (a reaction which may be unjustified  even if the guns were real), in the process exposing their own tendency  of firearm abuse. \nWhat a cruel joke. \n[I]Also read: [URL="http://www.dawn.com/news/1146556"]US police shoot dead 12-year-old boy holding toy gun[/URL][/I]\nAnother occasion our doomed proximity with weapons manifested itself in, was the [URL="http://www.dawn.com/news/1156730"]move to allow teachers in K-P to carry firearms[/URL]. It ultimately resulted in what many of us feared from the beginning: [URL="http://www.dawn.com/news/1187782"]the accidental death of a schoolchild in Swat[/URL].\nThat is why I welcomed the [URL="http://www.dawn.com/news/1199876"]resolution[/URL]  tabled in Sindh Assembly earlier this month, which sought to enforce a  ban on toy guns. Lawmakers and civil society members have implemented or  are seeking similar bans in [URL="http://www.dawn.com/news/1190287"]Punjab[/URL] and [URL="http://www.dawn.com/news/1192830"]K-P[/URL].\nOne  might chide these moves as irrelevant and useless to our very real  terrorism problems, wrought with real guns. But, the fact is, we have  now seen target killers emerge from even the more educated and affluent  sections of our society, and that the ''real terrorism'' is happening in  the same streets that our kids play in.\nThe lines are further  blurred thanks to the dark times we live in; when even the ''good side''  is not seen without a huge cache of weapons of their own. That makes it  all the more important to teach our kids that guns exist only as a  necessary evil and are not a normal way of life. The culture of violence  and aggression should not be glorified.\n[I]See: [URL="http://www.dawn.com/news/1192246"]Three teens held for &#8216;toy gun robbery&#8217;[/URL][/I]\nOtherwise,  we are essentially desensitising the concept of death by firearm &#8211;  making our children&#8217;s minds numb to the loss of life in a very subtle  way.\nLet us not be passive about this matter. Our kids should have  a childhood that is violence-free &#8211; even in their make-believe worlds &#8211;  so that they are allowed to grow up into peace-loving adults. \n                \n\n[URL]http://www.dawn.com/news/1203417/fake-guns-real-terrorism[/URL]', ''),

Under the existing system the MOI issues licences to those over the age of 18, so has anyone of those people who you are quoting here has shot anyone so far? If not, then your argument lacks weight. And I for a fact know what the Armed Forces train a person for, so wouldn''t need an insight into that :tongue: . And I know people above the age of 30 who have in anger talked about shooting people, so does it suggest that even 30 is not a suitable age ? btw one of that person has access to over half a dozen firearms and he is yet to practically shoot an animal, let alone a human.\n\nIf someone at the age of 18 is considered an adult in our country he should be allowed a licence just the way he is allowed to vote and drive. BTW most of the youngsters who are into street racing (or rash driving) etc in our big cities are around 18-21 (most of them from affluent families and students of A levels / universities). Why not change the driving eligibility age just because of these few people ?  \n\n\n[QUOTE=a_rsoud;485703]In my opinion 25 year is minimum age for gun licence.[/QUOTE]', ''),

Lets submit such articles to blogs of more of the reputed news organisations such as the The News, Express Tribune etc. \nThis way our lobbying efforts reach a larger number of people, since most people who are not familiar with firearm ownership, safety and use tend to fall into the populist slogans by uninformed opinion makers such as "lets ban all guns", "lets ban all new licenses", or even "lets ban all new or old licenses!!!". \nIts incomprehensible for any relatively informed person how such ridiculous calls could be made at all. \nWe need to go a long way in order for the general population to understand the facts of our society, where the spread of illegal firearms is so high, that law enforcement agencies are out of their depth to control law and order. The end of target killing is Karachi, has not even scratched the surface when we discuss protection provided by government to ordinary citizens, especially when compared to the more than 28000 incidents of mobile phone, wallet snatchings since jan of 2015 alone. \nAfter every major criminal incident the govt calls for citizens to protect themselves since the law enforcement agencies are under-staffed and under-equipped, under-funded, and busy taking care of terrorism; be it the Peshawar APS incident or attacks on minorities. But at the same time calls start ringing out for the de-weaponisation of the populace. This logic is inherently contradictory. \nIts not ok for ordinary citizens to keep getting robbed, and killed while the government agencies are busy taking care of terrorism. \nLet start the process of forming PGA (Pakistan Gun Owners Association) and start lobbying on a professional level.', ''),

(648074, ' Salam All,\n@ PG - 1 and all - I will try to be short and brief with my opinions on this matter as its one where the debate will probably continue with pros and cons of firearms ownership long after...\n \nFirstly, unless I am mistaken here, there is no right to keep and bear arms law/bill in Pakistan.  Hence, I say here that disarming policy though detrimental to this nation will have to be followed should this rule of law gets implemented.  I may not like it but should this happen I will make sure that my next vote will go to the other guy.  Presently with all the criminal chaos in all the cities - even the police will state when one asks them for protection to go out and purchase a weapon.  Criminals will always have guns, that''s why they are always called criminals and its always the legal rule of law following citizen that ends up suffering the consequences of a criminal''s actions.  A nation of gun owning citizens is an important asset to that nation and not a liability.  Too bad most who have a lot to hide in positions of power try to lay a more permanent foundation for their future by weakening the very same people who laid the foundation stone for them.  Anyways, Abbas, a very good thread.  What we need here is to completely outlaw the red tape legalities, shortcomings, of ownership.  I will try to go point by point with your outline as best as I can.  If I skip something - that just means that I am in complete agreement with it as its as logical and straight forward put as possible.\n \n1.  Registration by way of computerization (database) of any and all firearms imported, manufactured, sold, and/or resold should be a must.  Just as in the US there must also be a AFIS based firearms database setup for law enforcement agencies.  I must add to it by stating that every owner must be issued a receipt copy of such purchases to be kept at home and not with firearms due to the fact that should there ever be any error or such regarding registration - it is proof for the owner that his/her firearm is in fact legally purchased.\n \n2.  A firearms course should be mandatory provided by either a government trained/approved range officer or at a government institution.  This will also provide further monetary resources to our agencies.  The Canadian model is truly an exquisite model.  I would however would like to add to it by stating that a psychological profile report must also be a requirement as this too is slowly being implemented in some countries now.\n \n3.  This is a point I have been raising for ages here now.  I am very grateful to find out that we are like minded in this one license for purchase(s) of firearm for the person themselves rather than a license for each firearm being purchased.  However, the two simple categories must also remain in place for NPB and PB.  One should be in possession of either ONE category of license.  NPB meaning no automatic weapons.  PB meaning semi auto and auto weapons.  This PB or restricted category license should have a further in-depth process of obtaining it.  What they should be?  Well, in US, one goes to the local sheriff and gets finger printed and states the reason for this type of purchase.  He then send the approval letter with prints to FBI.  Upon their approval it then gets up to BATF who then process it and approve it.  Don''t know, I am not stating here that this is what we need; however, I am stating that these two categories must exist and much more stringent verification processes must be implemented for the purchase of PB license.\n \n4.  Agreed, can''t think of anything.\n \n5.         a.) Agreed\n            b.) Agreed\n            c.) Agreed\n            d.) Agreed\n \n6.  Don''t know if and when if this gets implemented - great idea.  The person-issued license should be enough to validate - if further just-cause to check then hold to investigate further I guess.\n \n7.  Dealers should be allowed imports without quotas. \n \n8.  New dealer licenses should be issued to new businesses wanting to enter this field and are able to fulfill the requirements - currently this is strictly a monopoly business.  Manufacturing licenses should also be issued as well to promote not just our industry but also the export market.  Currently, the only place they are issued is KPK and only if located mainly in Peshawar.  Why not other provinces?  Our talent goes to KPK to work.  DSA''s top engineers are from Pindigaib or Ikhlaas village in Attock.  Same applies to a lot of other workforce in that area.  Also most parts manufacturing in raw form is done in Lahore.  Why not Punjab or Sindh or Balochistan for manufacturing?\n \n8.  Nice thought - even nicer if it gets implemented with some truthful and thoughtful people. \n \n9.  A newer proper sports organization(s) should be formed and liaison with some international organization for the purpose of training future talents to compete in international events.  The management hierarchy of this organization should be chosen once every two years with absolutely NO chance of them serving more than one term regardless of their work history after their term has completed.  This would weed out some who are just sitting on current posts and doing nothing.\n \nBanning all weapons would infact give more power to the criminals I agree and leave all the law abiding defenseless but I say if a stroke of the pen puts the law abiding in such a position then I do hope that the same will use their power of vote to make things right.\n \n \n \n \n@Survivalist - I agree with you on most points except again #6.  You are again causing red tape by making too many categories of licenses.  On the license application form there is a section which will ask Purpose and one can clearly state on there.... hunting, defense, sport, collector or such....  #7 - again most owners do not have a club to go to nor one nearby to join.  So training a must but no club membership necessary.  Regarding your mention of cartridge quantity ownership I will state this to you.  As much as I shoot.  Up till 5 years ago, I never kept more than 200 round with me.  Why?  because of availability.  Since then its been an uphill battle to obtain good ammo at reasonable price.  Once importation begins as according to the optimistic ideology then I do believe noone will be out there buying tons of ammo.  As far as POF stuff goes now a days, I want to believe what you are stating but they are certainly going to have to win me over after the past few years of fiascos regarding their quality which I do understand has been an uphill battle for our esteem member Skeeter60 and he too will tell you there is much more improvement that needs to be done.\n \n@Spiffyali - the PAL is a great concept and I do believe sir that it can be implemented here.  Just about every city has a range and our law enforcement agencies will benefit from this too.  A similar model also exists for UK.  Btw, did you challenge or take the course (PAL)?\n \n@Ahnab - bro though in complete agreement with you on the way I like things.  I do believe that in this country firearms ownership is a privilege and not a right as is driving a car.\n \n@MichealZWilliamson - though nothing in life may be perfect but it does work better than most.  Please bear in mind that it came into being after a major rise in violence caused by the biker community fighting for drug turf... a war that ended up killing the innocents.  As was the case with the first law regarding auto weapons in the US... the mafia were fighting for turf and the innocents were taking the hits.  That tax stamp you all pay for - for ''Fully Transferable'' class III firearms is still $200.00 - I can''t believe that after all this time - its still that amount.', ''),

(648167, 'Gun Laws in Pakistan [FONT=arial]\n[B]&#8203;[/B]&#8203;The subject is addressed in a very timely manner by @Abbas with detailed suggestions from our worthy fellow members. It’s a good thing that the Government is serious to control negative applications of guns.\n \n \n[B]The threat is real and going to stay.[/B] While we are physically surrounded by gun-rich and ready-for-war countries along with being geographically located in a way that is attractive and sensitive to many countries in the region and around the world, it tops-up with the fact that our country faces serious harm from some people within… who are a [U]threat to country’s peace and security at both levels, civilian and government institutions.[/U]\n \n \n[B]Re-adjustment of the perspective about this matter may be needed.[/B] The discussion should not be Government v/s Gun Owners (because both carry guns)…rather, it may be Good guys v/s Bad guys to put it in simplest terms.\n \nThe Good Guys being: Our government, our military, all law enforcement departments & authorities and all law abiding citizens that may include unarmed civilians, people owning proper documented and registered arms, government employees and so on who contribute to and constitute this country.\n \n[U]So we are on one side.[/U] Once we realise that, it will be a suggestion, advice and discussion scenario rather than an argument and debate.\n \n \nThe Bad Guys being: Those who are threat to our national sovereignty, peace and security, from outside the borders or from within. These are the guys because of whom government is taking drastic measures as we read in the media news which are a quick-fix with apparently no permanent solution in the long run.\n \n \nThe bad guys will somehow always have unlicensed guns. There are typical scenarios where small arms are used or play a part to disrupt peace and security. Most commonly killing of innocent, counter attack or bystanders, car jacking, robbery at residential or commercial premises. In such scenarios, [U]if the bad guy knows that there is a possibility of facing a competent and licensed defending person (may it be his premises or life), its a big enough deterrent already[/U] as compared to a scenario where a guy with gun on a motorbike robs an un-armed person on road and despite there are fifty people around he walks away unworried.\n \n\n[B]The policy makers have to be practical in addressing this matter.[/B] We are neither as small and centralized in population as the UAE where Police network is very effective with no guns for general public. Its not possible for our country at this time to provide police units in that ratio of population and the police budget as of UAE. Neither we are as rich as the governments of US, Canada or Australia that we arm them with hi-tech equipment and guns, increase the number of police units in accordance to population and put them to their actual duty of serving the civilian population. Needless to say the better and easier option would be effective judiciary and law enforcement as practiced in the Gulf states and other countries with low crime rate who achieved that in return of implementation of the above.\n \nOn point of submission of licensed weapons (as well), being legal and registered owners of a commodity...wouldn''t it be logical and legal for the gun owners to claim the market value of their weapons submitted to government? Same as when government pays owners of houses and lands when there is an acquisition of land for roads etc. I guess the legally registered weapons will be worth billions.... \n\n  \n[B]Adopting the best, practical and innovative options in any given situation is the way to a progressive nation.[/B] Like most developed and fast-pace developing countries, who chose new technologies, practices, policies and standards whenever faced by crisis situation. Regarding laws of gun ownership and control, we have many good examples from around the world like Switzerland, Australia, Canada and USA as mentioned by fellow members. Our law / policy makers can take the suitable points from all these models that fit and suit our regional, cultural and domestic scenarios.\n \n\n[SIZE=4]We as a community, and I am proud to say…a very learned one about their hobby and otherwise, peaceful, united and patriotic, are positively willing and interested to contribute to establishing ‘gun ownership and control laws’ where we empower and secure our nations biggest asset, its civilian population. At the same time, to ensure that bad elements do not get a chance to disrupt the peace and security of general public.[/SIZE][/FONT]', ''),

Mine is a UK version and power is fixed at 12flbs. So there is no options of the power wheel here, the power can be easily changed but it is against the law in uk with out a firearm licence, to go over 12flbs of power.  So they don''t come with the fancy power wheel feature.  But your right sir they do in America and since your beautiful rifle is designed more on the american version it has these features sir.   That''s why I was really interested in this rifle here bro as I could put all my parts into that frame and have those extra settings but will have to have a good inspection and then make a decision if there still available here. It is amazing rifle you''ve got bro to be honest and sooo many mods that you can do it,  for when your bored and want to change things up a little.

I am unable to understand how a licensed weapon can be used in any illegal activity or some crime? \nIs the owner of that weapon out of his mind to use his weapon to kill someone with his licensed weapon?\nOr is he a criminal having the license of a weapon?\nin both of the above situations who is at fault Govt or us?\nHowever it should be considered that the licenses should be scrutinized and those licenses issued to people with criminal record should stand cancelled. Govt is taking the example of such licenses and going to deweaponize every body without taking into consideration that this is also their fault.''\ncan they tell who issued licenses to these criminal elements?\ndid they check their criminal background and mental health while issuing them licenses?\nHow can they ensure safety to every one by taking their licensed weapons?\nwill this bill be powerfull enough to detere criminals from using unlicensed arms in their activities?\nIn my opinion deweaponization will only result into a sudden rise in crime. and people will remain unable to defend themselves. \nI believe ''''a gun free country is not a democratic country'''' it is a new form of dictatorship.\nwe should stand together for our rights.', ''),

Whatever pistol you choose, minimum barrel length should be 4 inches and 4.5 inches or above would be excellent\n- I now prefer hamared pistol over the stricker fired pistol, hamered pistols give you just so much more control, so I would recommend a hamared pistol\n- Whenever you go to purchase a pistol, I recommend that you tag a senior along, one from this forum. If you were in Karachi I would have gladly helped you out\n- A polymer framed pistol will be lighter, easy to maintain but a metal frame pistol would be heavier, will require regular maintenance to keep away from rust. On the other hand, metal framed pistols are more durable, provide more accuracy and handle the recoil much better as compared to polymer frames due to their weight', ''),

(648512, '.308 Win Sporter (POF) Finally reviewed It was almost 10 months back in December 2014, when a breaking news echoed at PG that Pakistan Ordinance Factory (POF) Wah has launched its first semi auto 308 rifle for the civilian market. It was named [I]308 Win Sporter[/I]. It was indeed something very exciting for which many gun enthusiasts, including myself were quite anxious to get their hands on. Now the issue was that the rules and regulations of Punjab Government barred the sale of the 308 Win Sporter (due to its calibre) in the jurisdiction of Punjab Province. So with a wait of more than 10 months, finally it was delivered to some dealer in Quetta, Baluchistan and then it reached me with a lot of twists and turns in the story.\nIts basic specs are:\nCalibre: 308 Winchester/ 7.62x51 NATO\nAction: Semi-Auto (Irreversible)\nPicatinny Rail Mount above the receiver.\nCame with 2 (5-round) Mags.\nWarranty: Repair and Parts (Covered by POF)\nBarrel Length: 20.5 inches\nOverall Length: 42 inches\nWeight: 8.7 pounds\n \n\n[B][U]NOTE: \n[/U][/B]All pictures are courtesy of my dear friend & PG member “[B]Fraz[/B]”. I sincerely believe I couldn’t have done a better job in photography than how he did it. Many thanks Roor, very much appreciated. Cheers\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%201_zpsa7mkq8rp.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%201_zpsa7mkq8rp.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%202_zpswmuymuxo.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%202_zpswmuymuxo.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nThe 308 Sporter is based on the design and mechanism of POF produced Amy’s primary battle rifle G3; initially made by Heckler & Koch, which is without question one of the most renowned battle rifles in the world and remains in service today with quite a few operational forces. I read somewhere that one of the main reasons why this design has remained in service for all these years is that it delivers stunningly reliable functionality attributed to its rolling lock design, which keeps working even in the most opposing environments. Unlike some would expect; in the rolling lock delayed blowback system, there is neither a gas tube, nor a gas system and accordingly no piston, no operating rod etc.\n\n\n \n[B][U]Packaging:[/U][/B]\nThe packaging includes the rifle; 2 (5 round) magazines; a sling and a cleaning kit.  The gun is not packed in anything except a long polythene bag locally known as “Lifafa”. I strongly feel that POF being a very reputable local manufacturer in Pakistan and with such a hefty price tag on their civilian products could do much better than this polythene bag. It wouldn’t have cost that much if they had made cardboard boxes for their civilian products and delivered the rifle in a presentable manner. My rifle had to travel a great deal from the manufacturer to the seller and then to me. So I think that the scratches I found on the receiver, magwell and the pistol grip trigger pack area could have been avoided if it were packed in a somewhat safe cardboard box.\nThe good thing is that the internals as well as externals of the rifle and the magazines are heftily drenched in oil so there can’t be any possibility of rust anywhere.\n \n[B][U]Barrel[/U][/B]\nThe barrel is almost 20.5 inches, which is expected to ensure a complete powder burn and would theoretically reduce noise levels as well for the shooter. The barrel of the Sporter has 4 grooves with right hand twist and is chrome lined. To keep the rifle as Civilian/Hunting profiled as possible, POF has ensured that there is no threading on the barrel, so eventually no muzzle break/ flash hider etc can be installed on the barrel. A very dear friend of mine has suggested to get the barrel threaded and install an IGF 53 style flash hider. Well! All in good time. InshAllah.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%203_zpsahcog7sp.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%203_zpsahcog7sp.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[B][U]Stock, Pistol Grip and the front Handguard[/U][/B]\nThe stock of the Sporter is made of synthetic polymer material and is the typical classic HK91/G3 fixed stock design. The Pistol grip is also made of polymer with one screw on its right side. The pistol grip has a grove for the right hand thumb and also for the rest of the fingers. The front handguard is of the Wide Forearm style and it too is made out of polymer. Underneath the handguard, on both sides, there are channels where the legs of the Classic Army G3 style bipod gets seated when folded. I don’t have any complaints regarding the polymer furniture, rather I have to praise it for its good quality and near to perfect fit. As I have a tendency of frequently knocking my rifles here and there so it is a plus point to have these parts of the Sporter in polymer finish. Having said that, even if it were in wood, I would have made it as a standing protocol to play around with the finish from time to time; not something I am proud of.\nThe rifle shoulders nicely and I don’t have to densely press my cheek with the stock. Being a fixed stock, no adjustment can be made to the pull length or cheek height. Because of the stock being of a standard size, it is supposed to be a fit for most of the shooters. Let me add, that if needed, the Magpul PRS or HK PSG stocks can be installed on the rifle without any alteration.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%206_zpsljzlie7w.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%206_zpsljzlie7w.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2011_zps3d0fa5fm.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2011_zps3d0fa5fm.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),
(648513, ' [B][U]Review Part 2\n\n\n[/U][/B][B][U]Sling[/U][/B]\nThe sling that came with the rifle is the same military grade sling that we normally see with our soldiers on their G3s. There are two sling swivel studs on the rifle. One is at the left side of the stock right in its centre and the other is at the junction point where the handguard starts right under the front sight tip. The sling is in two pieces and I have no idea at all, which end goes where. (Will have to ask someone for help in installing it). Nowadays, Chinese copies of the Magpul two-point slings are available in the market and they can be installed on the Sporter. From &#8220;Shashka&#8221; and style point of view, it may seem like a good idea, however, being a very long rifle, there is no practicality in carrying it in the assault rifle style with one end of the strap over one shoulder and the other end slipping under the other armpit.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%209_zpsnffzdfc0.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%209_zpsnffzdfc0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\n[B][U]Trigger[/U][/B]\nIf the reader has had the opportunity of using a G3, he would get the idea that the trigger pull and feel of the Sporter is not much different than its parent rifle. Yes, it&#8217;s a combat trigger. To me, the first stage was almost NIL as the trigger traveled hardly for a millimetre. It was absolutely smooth without any halting or gluey like feeling. But then as soon as the trigger reached the sear, there was a minutely slight creep with a somewhat long travel and then it broke crisply. I also noticed that the trigger doesn&#8217;t need to be released all the way forward for it to reset and its likably short.\nAnyways, I have yet to minutely study the internals of the trigger mechanism but I can fairly say that some polishing here and there may make it much much better for precision target shooting. In short, on first try, the Sporter&#8217;s trigger felt awkward but the clean break was like a symphony. I am sure I will be able to make a better comparisons and respond to further questions once I have used it at the range.\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%205_zpsga3xsgps.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%205_zpsga3xsgps.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B][U]Iron Sights[/U][/B]\nThe front sights of the Sporter is hooded and the rear one is rotary dioptre. The front hooded sight appears to be nearly identical as the HK91. The rotary rear sight has 4 adjustments i.e. 100m ''V'' sight and then 200, 300 & 400m aperture sights. The rear sights are adjustable for windage and elevation. As most of the people in Pakistan have comparatively more frequent exposure to the AK type sights, it would require some getting used to the dioptre sights. I noticed that the V style 100 m notch has a very light coloured Grey finish and due to that it enhances the glare making it difficult for the shooter to focus on it properly. I plan to give it a dark black matte finish which will solve this issue. \n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%208_zpsyfns2ipq.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%208_zpsyfns2ipq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', '');

(648514, ' [B][U]Review Part 3\n\n[/U][/B][B]Picatinny Rail[/B]\nAnother interesting feature on Sporter is the welded optic rail that is designed as such that it does not restrict the usage of iron sights. Due to this rail, now the users won’t have to put those claw like mounts on their rifles which in fact look quite awkward. The user can just install an optic or a holographic sight on the rifle without additional cost of the mount. This setup is surely more dependable than any other mount system which we see for the HKs. So with its Picatinny rail on the receiver, the Sporter can be equipped with a good quality optic and thus the true essence of long distance shooting can be enjoyed with it. About a year back, I got my hands on a Leupold Mark 4 M3-10X with elevation turrets calibrated specifically for 308 Calibre so I am all set to test the rifle’s precision with a sufficiently good quality optic. However, when installing the scope, I noticed that the rings that came with the optic were not high enough and the eye piece side of the scope was restricted by the iron sights. Now I am on a hunt for at-least 1.5 inch high rings for a 30 mm tube.\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%204_zpsyndattlb.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%204_zpsyndattlb.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n \n[B]Safety/Fire Select Lever[/B]\nThe safety lever is on the left side of the rifle and can be easily accessed with the thumb of the right hand while keep the palm and fingers on the pistol grip. Right in front of the safety lever, there is “S” and “E” embossed/printed on the receiver, indicating Safety and Semi auto Fire, respectively. On the right side of the receiver, there is only an indicator which shows the status of the weapon i.e. whether it’s in safe or in fire mode. \n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2012_zpstp3cps4v.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2012_zpstp3cps4v.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%204_zpseqsupifn.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%204_zpseqsupifn.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n \n[B]\n\nMagazines[/B]\nThe quality of the two (5 Round) magazines that came with the rifle is just OK. I plan to get them re-blued after sometime as they have been heavily painted/coated. Like many other battle rifles, the magazines need to be inserted in the magwell and then seated with a firm slap to ensure it’s locked in its place. I noticed that inserting these mags in to the magwell is only possible with a more-than-firm slap underneath it. I am not sure if the usual 20 round G3 magazines will fit in the Sporter or not; as I have yet to test any. I sincerely hope that to make this rifle “completely civilian” in all respects, the POF would not have altered the magazine seating mechanism and the 20 round mag will fit in it. After inserting it with a slap, the magazine sits very tightly in its place and is barely distinguishable from the side with the magwell owing to its small size and capacity. The Sporter has two type of mechanisms for mag-release. One is the lever which is in its typical place like the AKs and the other is a push button (Like the ARs) and is on the right side of the receiver.\nAn interesting find was that the 5 round magazine actually accepts 6 rounds. lol.\n \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2014_zpsdwrvoswe.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2014_zpsdwrvoswe.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2015_zpstyil1unm.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2015_zpstyil1unm.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]\nCharging Handle[/B]\nTypical of the HK family, the Sporter has the same design and placement of the folding bolt charging handle just like its parent rifle which is located above the left hand side of the handguard. The thing I like the most about the HK charging handles is their non-reciprocating movement i.e. once cocked, the charging handle will not move (unlike the AK) and will remain stationary. Similar to the AR platform, this gives the shooter a sense of safety as no moving parts are open. The bolt charging handle locks back once the magazine goes empty. After feeding in a fresh mag, the charging handle can be pulled back to cock the rifle.\nThe folding non-reciprocating charging handle can be used to lock the bolt to the rear by lifting it up into a notch. So for loading the rifle, the user will have to pull back the folding charging handle with strength and then lock it at the back in the notch. With a firm slap from the palm heel, the bolt is released which ensures the feeding of the round in the chamber; this is certainly a fun and fulfilling way to charge a gun. I am afraid, some softies will have a hard time loading this beast. I am over 6 feet tall and for me reaching the charging handle while keeping the rifle shouldered was a serious task as it required complete extension of my left arm and shoulder to reach the handle.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%207_zpsid5k9xim.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%207_zpsid5k9xim.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),
(648515, ' [B][U]Review Part 4\n[/U][/B]\n\n[B]Cleaning Kit[/B]\nThe cleaning kit that came with the Sporter in in a plastic box 4x6 inches. It comprises of three different types of brushes, a weighted chord and bore cleaning rags. In the old designs of HK91 and G3, the cleaning kit used to be in the shape of a tube which was inserted in another tube right under the front sight tip above the muzzle. \n \n[B]Weight Consideration[/B]\nThe POF&#8217;s website doesn&#8217;t state the weight of the Sporter, however based on the weighing scale which I have at home, it was slightly more than 8.7 pounds. So with this empty weight (more with scope, sling, magazine and ammo), the Sporter isn&#8217;t exactly something which you would want to carry while hunting in woods or in a mountainous area. With this much weight, I am not sure if hunting was a primary consideration in designing and launch of this rifle, however, it would certainly work well when reliability and ruggedness is a greater requirement than weight.\n \n[B]Field Stripping & Disassembly:[/B]\nFor field stripping the Sporter, the two pins at the rear of the receiver (near the buttstock) have to be pushed out and then the butt can then be extracted to the rear. The operating spring and guide rod would come out with it. The pistol grip and trigger pack is attached with the receiver through another pin which when removed, the trigger pack should be easily removed. After that once the muzzle end is raised, a slight backward jerk on the charging handle would send the bolt and bolt carrier group out the rear of the receiver. The field tripping of the Sporter is quite quick and simple.\n \nPictured below, the two pins above and behind the pistol grip and a single pin right above the magazine release lever need to be removed to disassemble the rifle.   \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2014_zps1hluu5cw.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2014_zps1hluu5cw.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]Fit, Appearance & Finesse[/B]\nThe fit between the metal parts and polymer (stock, front handguard and pistol grip) is very good. I didn&#8217;t observe any uneven gaps or flimsiness as far as the fit is concerned. However, and that&#8217;s a big HOWEVER, the finish of the Sporter is poor. Many would term it as crappy, yes you heard me right; it&#8217;s crappy. Let me explain it in detail; the surface finish of the metal is perfectly fine, no doubt about that. It looks quite obvious that for the workmanship on the metal parts, POF utilized the services of the best there is. But after that, it seems as if POF lost all interest in this project and they gave the Sporter to a roadside Truck-Art painter and asked him to paint it black with a 4 inch wide brush. It would have been OK if that Truck-Art painter had given it a coat or two at max, but it seems that the guy was adamant on giving it at-least a dozen coats. The paint is rough at places and can be scratched off even with a finger nail. Now to be honest, for me that&#8217;s not a big issue as I can play miracles with its finish. Fortunately, the people I know can beautify the Sporter in a way that even Daniel Defence will be head over heels to see it. (No I am not joking at all). But this good fortune is not enjoyed by many. So POF needs to keep this in consideration that their 308 Win Sporter is a civilian product and Finesse is an integral part of any merchandise intended for the general public i.e. gun enthusiasts.\nMy overall verdict about the fit is that the rifle is solid and a very tight gun, but a lot needs to be desired in Finesse department.\n \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2013_zpss7jctlyz.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2013_zpss7jctlyz.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]Final Thoughts[/B]\nAlong with hunters, another breed of shooters who might want to get hold of the Sporter could be those who are kicking off with newly entering the sport of long distance shooting competitions. In many movies we have seen those long distance snipers equipped with HK91 based platform rifles so with a proven record of accuracy and reliability, Sporter is also expected to do good for these shooters.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2016_zpsvdprmakq.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2016_zpsvdprmakq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]', ''),

Most of them are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and  they were resettled at a small industrial estate in Peshawar in 2006  after the government wanted to abolish illegal arms production units in  Darra Adam Khel.\n&#8220;Some of pistols and shotguns made by local  manufacturers have passed quality tests in the United States and the  United Kingdom and there are regular small scale exports of these  weapons, but despite meeting all standards law-enforcement agencies are  not buying weapons from local manufacturers,&#8221; Mr Khattak said.\nHe  told the committee that main arms produced by Pakistani companies were  various models of 30 bore pistols (TT), 12 bore shotguns, 9mm pistols  and 22 bore rifles.\nHe showed pictures of some pistols made by the Peshawar Arms Company that has been approved by US standards. \nSenator  Kulsoom Parveen suggested the PHSDAC to develop specialised units among  factories to introduce the concept of mass production at low cost.\nMeanwhile,  speaking at another agenda item, the additional secretary of the  Ministry of Industries criticised private members on the boards of  state-owned entities for making personal gains by asking for vehicles  and other favours. \n[I]Published in Dawn, September 16th, 2015[/I]', ''),

All five attacks were identical in nature where armed motorcyclists opened fire at the on-duty personnel at their regular positions in Saddar, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Sher Shah, Mai Kolachi Road and Nazimabad. In a separate incident, one traffic police official was deprived of his official weapon while on duty in Defence Housing Authority (DHA).[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#212121][FONT=Georgia]Though the traffic police have been provided weapons and bulletproof jackets to protect themselves, these steps have proved to be inadequate.

I think most high street gun retailers like Fakhre Alam etc are out of stock for MP 153 but this guy has one or may be more in stock and clearly seems to be taking advantage of the shortage in market because one of his defence line is that the MP 153 are short market at the moment due to the import ban.\n\n His demand price is 68K and after discount 65. While I am sure not long ago begining of 2015 Fakhre Alam quoted me around 55K.\n\nHe also offered me the ATA Wood for 68k, Snake Colour 65K, Army/Camo 62K. But I dont want the ATA.\n\n2. I intend to sell my Hatsan Combo if I''m buying MP 153 as It''s gonna be pointless me keeping both, because I wont the Hatsan no more. \n\nHe sells Hatsan Esc Combo for 55K in his shop but want to buy/ part ex mine for peanuts.  \n\nBudget is not an issue at all, the only reason I preferred to go for MP153 is simply to start the game as a beginner, get a bit of practice first and then in sha Allah take it from there on wards.', ''),

Even shooting at 900-1000 fps, the force delivered by an Airgun (PCP rifle) is around 30 fpe.... the .22lr delivers around a 100 fpe so if its force that you seek then airguns are no comparison to firearms... \n\nIf you seek to do what an airgun is suppose to do, simply target an airgun which shoots at 700-730 fps:\n\n1- Recoil will be manageable\n2- The control over gun will be easy making your shots more accurate\n3- The cheap first copy CP clone will do wonders for you on that force', ''),

As soon as he bent down to pick up his bag lying on the floor mat of the passenger seat. He heard a shot being fired, and felt a hole being ripped into the head-rest of his own seat. While bent down he chambered his tt and fired back. The guys were not expecting him to return fire, and shouted " Oye, es ke pass bhi hai!!". \nThey began to speed away but their motorcycle slipped, they quickly stood up and started firing at him again. In the meantime he had gotten out to take cover behind the back of his vehicle and returned some more fire, it was turning into a full fledged firefight, when his desi TT malfunctioned !!! \nHe hid behind the trunk of his vehicle, and expected the guys to walk up to him and shoot him in the head. \n\nLuckily the attackers thought he was taking cover to reload. They pulled their motorcycle up and sped away. \n\nThe moral of the story:  The firing pin in his TT had broken, and he almost got killed due to it. It was only due to his family''s prayers that he lived to tell the story. \nTherefore, never ever rely on a desi gun to protect your life !!!:fencing:', ''),

(648805, ' [QUOTE=Deathrow;486428]Bro even the high quality CP clones will not hold up to 750 fps and above airguns... They will eventually break so that''s why I always advice people to get airguns that shoot around 700 fps.... that is more than enough to shoot at long distances and for small game.. Why would you want a gun with more fps? if your objective is quest for power, simply go for a firearm and make your life easy.... Even shooting at 900-1000 fps, the force delivered by an Airgun (PCP rifle) is around 30 fpe.... the .22lr delivers around a 100 fpe so if its force that you seek then airguns are no comparison to firearms... \n\nIf you seek to do what an airgun is suppose to do, simply target an airgun which shoots at 700-730 fps:\n\n1- Recoil will be manageable\n2- The control over gun will be easy making your shots more accurate\n3- The cheap first copy CP clone will do wonders for you on that force[/QUOTE]\n\nI am not looking to buy scope right away. I''ll loosen some shots ,than might add a scope. They do make air guns with 1600fps etc like some gamo models @ 1300fps and still decent accuracy. I wonder why these guns were made if 700fps was enough. \n\n But real thing to match is fpe. And yes Airguns are no match in fpe to firearms \n\nI''m in love with bolt action rifles ,not the autos or the semis , only bolt actions  . One of my favourites are Remington 700 , 770 models and  Savagearms 111xp . But with bigger calibers like .308 or 30-06 . .22 is also fine . Too bad I guess Punjab licenses are closed right now and I can''t arrange a budget close to these rifles , but someday IA .\n\nI have a 12 kanal back yard , where I''ll be practising targets with airgun. Other point to note is that with a firearm a proper rifle you can''t just shoot rounds in your back yard :p , need to go out of suburbs , in open areas  or rifle ranges . That''s the advantage an airgun is it has freedom of shooting\n\nI went to local arms dealer in lahore to check air rifles , I got to hold the gamo shadow 1k , gamo whisper x and spa b11 , they did not had ga 1250 in stock \n\nGamos were light in weight wig nice feel to hand , ion other hand the spa b11 was very nicely built .

They shoot at 900+ fps.  For the very rare few who can control their recoil, they are very accurate airguns. For the majority of population, they are labeled as being *extremely inaccurate* and mostly people who get these air rifles sell them off within a month. No quality airgun is inaccurate, you just need to figure it out and if you can''t, then you are left with no choice but to get rid of it.\n\n2- The FPS claimed by manufacturers are not actual, infact never actual.

One thing to note that along side mentioned velocity they Mention ''PBA'' Pellet. A PBA pellet is usually  5-6 grains approx . So 1600fps with this will make 30fpe. \n\nFuthermore look in this link [url]http://www.gamousa.com/product.aspx?productID=178[/url] it''s for gamo pro magum pellets , uder fps you will see 700fps and gun used is gamo hunter pro.  \n\nNow if you you look at gamo hunter pro here ,[url]http://www.gamousa.com/product.aspx?productID=63[/url] it''s a 1200fps gun. So it''s clear they use .177 PBA ammo and may exaggerate a litte. Also I think .177 means no accuracy . \n\nI understood all your points. And btw nice chrony testing of different airguns  .

(648873, ' [QUOTE=Deathrow;476014][COLOR=#141823][FONT=Helvetica]Asalam o Alaikum, sorry guys I have not made a post recently on the club...been a little tied up...Anyhow I have made so modifications in my Gamo Shadow...( only recommended for expert level airgunners at your own risk).. The first set of changes were made in the trigger assembly. All contact points of the trigger mechanism were polished. Next the adjustment screw was replaced with a slightly longer one... Finding a 2.5 mm diameter screw was a little diffcult but Alhumdulilla[/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#141823][FONT=Helvetica]h eventually managed to do so.. this longer screw allowed me to decrease the second stage of the trigger. Now this is a dangerous bit...sometimes the trigger becomes so light that as you load the airgun, the sear is released and the gun shoots... Sometimes the gun would not lock and load...at this point you need to loosen the screw a bit... Secondly I played around with the spring and piston....I polished the piston a bit, greased entire airgun. The guide rod in New shadows is polymer but the head is metal. I fixed a polymer head on top on the metal head which provided about 2.5mm of shimming in the spring...\r\nResults: The trigger is a lot smoother and my gun was previously shooting at 700 fps with H&N ftt pellets. Now it''s shooting at an average of 733 fps with some shots even touching 750 fps which makes it into a 17.5 fpe gun from a 12 fps gun... Drastic change and improvement....\r\n\r\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/w5k5we9sl/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/w5k5we9sl/IMAG0874_BURST002.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/ee8jhxudx/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/ee8jhxudx/IMAG0875.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/67gjqd4b9/][img]http://s26.postimg.org/67gjqd4b9/IMAG0876.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nSalam,\r\nGreat thread, Deathrow Bro....\r\n\r\nThis is good work you''re doing.

(648877, ' [QUOTE=Aebak;486444]An acquaintance of a friend of mine had a hit put on him by some criminal elements last year in Karachi, and unfortunately he decided to carry a desi TT to protect himself. \nOne day after work when he was parking his car outside his apartment building 2 guys on a motorcycle were parked on the other side of the street with their helmets on. As soon as he bent down to pick up his bag lying on the floor mat of the passenger seat. He heard a shot being fired, and felt a hole being ripped into the head-rest of his own seat. While bent down he chambered his tt and fired back. The guys were not expecting him to return fire, and shouted " Oye, es ke pass bhi hai!!". \nThey began to speed away but their motorcycle slipped, they quickly stood up and started firing at him again. In the meantime he had gotten out to take cover behind the back of his vehicle and returned some more fire, it was turning into a full fledged firefight, when his desi TT malfunctioned !!! \nHe hid behind the trunk of his vehicle, and expected the guys to walk up to him and shoot him in the head. \n\nLuckily the attackers thought he was taking cover to reload. They pulled their motorcycle up and sped away. \n\nThe moral of the story:  The firing pin in his TT had broken, and he almost got killed due to it. It was only due to his family''s prayers that he lived to tell the story. \nTherefore, never ever rely on a desi gun to protect your life !!!:fencing:[/QUOTE]\n\nSorry to hear what had happened. M.A he is ok and did not get hurt or something worse.  But that also is a good point as well reliability,  another point I''ll put across to my friend.  He has been carrying his for a while now and he thinks it just as reliable as any other fun as it hasn''t so far let him down.  But I honestly don''t think he has even used it that much at all.

Some advises... \n\nDo not use any grease other than Molly grease for internals and tuning (specially inside the cylinder). You may purchase some from the below mentioned link:\n\n[url]https://www.facebook.com/zairgun?fref=ts[/url]  \n(its called the Z Airgun Store, search it on Facebook)\n\n100 grams of Molly Grease for Rs. 400 and its enough to last you a life time\n\nDo not mess around with the guide rod, if you to smoothen your airgun, order a tunekit for Diana 34 from:\n[url]http://vortekproducts.com/ourstore/[/url]\n\nAnother step can be taken to smooth the shot cycle. When you are going to dis-assemble the airgun to change your spring, polish the piston with high-grit sand paper.... Look for any rub marks on the cylinder, which the pistol is rubbing against the cylinder, polish it well.... However be very careful during this step... You dont want to over polish the piston... It should flow tightly into the cylinder but there should be no rubbing parts.... it should move tight yet smooth...  You may also polish the two cut ends of the spring (The flat cut rough parts on either ends of the spring). polish to make them smooth because the spring turns during the shot...smoothing them makes a difference in the shot cycle..Wash the cylinder and piston with petrol once done with polishing to remove all excess metal deposits and then start with greasing... Remember one thing about Molly, the less the better... Apply a very thin coat of grease on the spring and on the gun...', ''),

Also, the faster the gun is shooting, the more pellet sensitive its going to be, and very hold sensitive too. Guns with so much power need extra heavy pellets for stable shooting, since one of the primary objectives is to keep the pellet sub-sonic, preferably at 800fps or below.

There is long list of what and how information can be accessed/steeled including network leaks, OS backdoors, key loggers, trojans, spyware etc and sophisticated softwares that using network/internet/gsm/gprs/emails are loaded in your pc/device and monitor all activities and access al information.

All of this information is being profiled (better than NADRA on super computers and Big Data systems), some is sold to corporates for data analysis, marketing, and some to government institutions for strategic planning, analysis and regional/community manipulation.

(649078, ' SUPREME HUNTER brother, actually this cheap (perhaps cheapest) Chinese air rifle with a Pakistani Sargodha made .22 barrel has surprised me by its accuracy. It can consistently hit a thumb pin at 30 yards, a .177 empty pellet tin at 50 yards and a 1.5 litre coke bottle at 100 plus yards. A high end PCP can easily do it. But I was not expecting it from this airgun. \n\nOnly group I shot with it and photographed (with my phone camera) was  on a tree and it was a single ragged hole from 33 yards, 5 shots of H&N FTT  .22 pellets. It was just a casual group, with proper bench rest, it may give better results.\n\n[ATTACH=CONFIG]35894[/ATTACH]\n\n350 cc air bottle once filled to 200 bar gives about 70 good power shots and you can boost up power by power wheel after that and get another 20-30 similar power shots. \n\nDue to its accuracy and power, I have enjoyed plinking with it at longer ranges (100+ yards).', ''),

The company has been riddled for years with claims the gun can fire  without the trigger being pulled, often with deadly results.  \n  A 2010 CNBC documentary, "[URL="http://www.cnbc.com/live-tv/cnbc-originals/full-episode/remington-under-fire-a-cnbc-investigation/367370307529"]Remington Under Fire: A CNBC Investigation[/URL],"  explored allegations that for decades the company covered up a design  defect, which Remington continues to deny. But now, under a nationwide  settlement filed Friday in a federal court in Missouri, the company is  agreeing to replace the triggers in about 7.85 million rifles. \n  While  insisting its action is not a recall of the iconic gun, Remington says  in a statement that it is agreeing to make the changes "to avoid the  uncertainties and expense of protracted litigation."\n \nRead More[URL="http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/20/gun-laws-vary-state-by-state-cnbc-explains.html"]Gun laws vary state by state: CNBC Explains[/URL]\n  The  settlement involves a class action suit brought in 2013 by Ian Pollard  of Concordia, Missouri, who claimed his Remington 700 rifle fired on  multiple occasions without the trigger being pulled. The agreement also settles a similar class action case in Washington state. The  Pollard suit accused Remington and its owners of negligence, breach of  warranty, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and fraudulent  concealment—some of it involving the company''s formal response to the  2010 CNBC documentary.\n \n  At least two dozen  deaths and more than 100 serious injuries have been linked to  inadvertent discharges of Remington 700 series rifles.\n \n  In court filings, Remington denied the allegations, calling them "inaccurate, misleading, (and) taken out of context." And last year, a judge dismissed several of the claims, including negligence and fraudulent concealment. But  by this July, the parties announced they were working out details of a  "nationwide class settlement" involving the controversial gun. \n   Under the settlement, which still must be approved by a judge,  Remington has agreed to retrofit the rifles in question at no cost to  the owner. Many users had new trigger mechanisms installed on their own,  and Remington will reimburse them as part of the settlement. For guns  that cannot be retrofitted, the company plans to offer vouchers for  Remington products. \nThe settlement covers more than a dozen  models, specifically the Model 700, Seven, Sportsman 78, 673, 710, 715,  770, 600, 660, XP-100, 721, 722 and 725.\n\nRemington''s  700 series, which began with the Model 721 shortly after World War II,  has been wildly popular not only with hunters and target shooters, but  also with law enforcement and the U.S. military. The gun is prized for  its accuracy and smooth operation, thanks to a unique trigger mechanism [URL="http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2012/05/03/2226706_Rem_Doc_05.pdf"]patented[/URL] in the 1940s by Remington engineer Merle "Mike" Walker.\n\n  But  the CNBC investigation revealed that even before the gun went on the  market, Walker himself had discovered a potential problem with the  trigger he designed. In a 1946 [URL="http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2012/05/03/2226703_Rem_Doc_02.pdf"]memo,[/URL] he  warned of a "theoretical unsafe condition" involving the gun''s  safety—the mechanism that''s supposed to keep the rifle from firing  accidentally. \n  Subsequent memos during the testing  process noted guns could be made to fire simply by switching off the  safety or operating the bolt. "This situation can be very dangerous from  a safety and functional point of view," said a 1947 [URL="http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2012/05/03/2226704_Rem_Doc_03.pdf"]inspection report[/URL]. \n  See the full CNBC documentary, "[URL="http://www.cnbc.com/live-tv/cnbc-originals/full-episode/remington-under-fire-a-cnbc-investigation/367370307529"]Remington Under Fire: A CNBC Investigation"[/URL] \n\n\n[IMG]http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/05/102244565-remington-model-700.530x298.jpg?v=1417811527[/IMG]CNBC \nIn  a national settlement involving one of America''s most popular guns,  Remington will replace millions of triggers on its popular Model 700  rifle.\n\n  While  Walker contended the issue had to do with the manufacturing process and  not his design, critics including firearms experts and plaintiffs''  attorneys have argued that the same aspects of the design that allow the  gun to fire so smoothly also make it possible for internal parts of the  trigger to become misaligned, rendering the gun unsafe. Specifically,  they cite a tiny part called a "trigger connector," which they say can  become clogged with rust or debris. Under the settlement, Remington  plans to replace the triggers with "connectorless" mechanisms—a similar  fix to one Walker himself [URL="http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2012/05/03/2226710_Rem_Doc_09.pdf"]proposed[/URL] in 1948. \nWalker  died in 2013 at age 101. But he told CNBC in 2010 that he believed  Remington''s rejection of his proposal back then "had something to do  with cost." A 1948 internal [URL="http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2012/05/03/2226711_Rem_Doc_11.pdf"]analysis[/URL] obtained by CNBC estimated the cost of the change to be 5 ½ cents per gun.\n\n   Remington has always maintained the guns are safe, and that the  documents obtained by CNBC are merely evidence of the company''s  attention to quality. The company claimed every accident was the result  of user error. \n  "The Model 700, including its trigger mechanism,  has been free of any defect since it was first produced," Remington  told CNBC in 2010. "And,  despite any careless reporting to the contrary, the gun''s use by  millions of Americans has proven it to be a safe, trusted and reliable  rifle." \n\n\n[h=4]Customer complaints[/h]   But CNBC uncovered thousands of customer complaints and more than 75  lawsuits alleging the gun is prone to firing without the trigger being  pulled, sometimes with deadly results. Many of the lawsuits were settled  out of court, typically with a provision that the terms be kept  confidential. \n  Among the deaths was nine-year-old Gus Barber of  Montana, killed during a family hunting trip in 2000 when his mother  switched off the safety on her Remington 700 rifle and the gun went off.  \n  Since then, Gus'' father, Rich Barber, has been on what he calls a "crusade" to learn the truth about the rifle.\n \n   "I went to the funeral home and looked Gus right square in the eye and  said, ''Son, it ends here and now,'' " Barber told CNBC in 2010. "I  promised him I''d never be bought off and I''d never quit until I''ve  effected change."\n \n  Since then, Barber has compiled a huge trove of evidence, including thousands of Remington internal documents.\n \n   He sued Remington, and in a settlement the company agreed to make  design changes in the popular rifle, and to offer to modify—for a  fee—older versions of the gun that required the user to switch off the  safety in order to unload the gun. But the company refused to launch a  full-blown recall, and in what Barber contends is a violation of the  agreement, continued to sell some models with the controversial Walker  trigger. \n  Under the proposed settlement, Remington will offer to  replace the Walker triggers with the replacement mechanism developed  following the settlement with Barber. That trigger is known as the  X-Mark Pro, but it has had issues of its own. Earlier this year, Remington [URL="http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/safety-center/safety-warning-recall-notice-Remington-model700-modelseven.aspx"]recalled[/URL]  thousands of X-Mark Pro models manufactured since 2006, after  determining that "excess bonding agent used in the assembly process"  could cause the guns to unintentionally discharge. That voluntary recall will continue as part of the class action settlement.\n  Barber is not a party in the latest class action cases, but has served as a paid consultant to the plaintiffs'' attorneys.  \n\n\n[IMG]http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/05/102244137-rich-gus-barber.530x298.jpg?v=1417802777[/IMG]CNBC \nRich  Barber has been on a “crusade” to learn more about the Remington 700  rifle after his 9-year-old son Gus was killed during a 2000 family  hunting trip.\n\n[INDENT] 	"I went to the funeral home and looked Gus right square in the eye and said, ''Son, it ends here and now.''" 			 	[/INDENT]"I never wanted there to be more Gus Barbers," he told CNBC Friday.\n\n"I''m  humbled by the whole thing," he said regarding the latest developments.  "For all the people who have come and gone in my life, I''m jealous.  They got their lives back. It was my intent to save people''s lives. I  can''t walk away as long as someone''s life hangs in the balance."\n\nBarber  noted Remington''s corporate structure has changed repeatedly over the  years, and he is pleased the company has finally agreed to fix the guns.\n\n"I''m  going to commend them for that. It''s not in my nature to attack my  adversary when they do the right thing. I commend them. People hear  Remington and they automatically think ''oldest gun manufacturer,'' but  people don''t know the company has changed many, many times. I feel more  sympathy to this new company."\n  This is not the first time  Remington has considered recalling the popular rifle. CNBC found that  at least twice—in 1970 and 1994—company officials discussed the idea but  ultimately rejected it. Again, the decisions had to do with the cost,  which had risen dramatically from Mike Walker''s original 5 ½ cents a  gun, and continues to go up today. \n  In a [URL="http://www.freedom-group.com/ROC_Q3_2014.pdf"]report[/URL]  to investors last month, Remington''s privately-held parent company,  Remington Outdoors, previously known as The Freedom Group, revealed it  had set aside $29.7 million in what the company called a "Model 700  settlement reserve."\n \n  The company''s owner, Cerberus Capital  Management, announced plans to exit the gun business in 2012 following  the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, but has yet to find a  buyer. \n  Read More[URL="http://www.cnbc.com/remington-under-fire/"]Remington under fire[/URL]', ''),

A brand new gun might not see this issue. the trigger assembly requires to be cleaned and left unlubricated (gun smith recommendation) as the oil will start dust and residue buildup and make it the trigger slippery. On a used gun a user may face this problem after 20 or so shots after some dirt buildup. Solution cleanup. Some users have reported to see this problem more than once in 20 rounds.\n\n3) Adjusted trigger: if the trigger is adjusted to less than 3 pounds the problem is prominent. a user has testified to this frequent problem at 2 pound trigger. his recommendation is stay above  the 3 mark.', ''),

(649446, ' @Abbas\n\nAs a lawyer I will be blunt about one thing....in fact Abbas bhai and our esteemed moderators might roll their eyes at my conversation here as I have been lightly reprimanded for the same at least once before.....\n\nA. Pakistan''s laws, its constitution and its regulation mechanisms are colonial in nature and thus I their letter and spirit do not, I repeat DO NOT grant gun ownership as a right but a privilege which might be extended and revoked without prior notice or any kind of reason what so ever.\n\nB. The first thing the British sarkar did during partition was to jail Muslim officers ( including my grandpa who was by then a major in the royal Indian army and a WW2 veteran) and confiscate as many weapons as they could ( only some of our swords and pistols survived the confiscation as they were shipped prior to partition to the Pakistani Punjab). So now you know what kind of mentality our laws and systems emulate.\n\nC. To curtail terrorism and crime and make guns traceable and the owners and dealers responsible we need to accept the fact that guns arent evil people are evil. Evil people will do evil things with their bare hands even if you ban guns and disarm us all. Moreover the black market which in our region of the world is the largest market of its kind will explode with growth as AFPAK is a gun runners paradise, you have all sorts of shit storms going on around from the caucuses to Afghanistan.\n\nD. Allow universal licencing and amnesty registration campaigns that for the time being register as many weapons in the public domain as possible. After that, as a second wave implement back ground checks and medical exams to the process that way weapons will stay out of the hands of the mentally ill and the convicted criminals.\n\nE. Automatic weapons are just as deadly as semi automatic weapons so the logic of PB and NPB redundant in my opinion a skilled shooter could wreak more havoc with an AR-15 as he will shoot more accurately.\n\nF. Do not let fire arm ownership stay a subject " to the whims" of bureaucrats and their clerks as that will spawn corruption and fake licencing. This is a tactic the British Raj used to bribe their favoured subjects and to strengthen loyalists against potential revolt by the people. Pakistan is not a colonial subject any more. We are a free country and we should act as such.', ''),
(649447, ' Continuing further........\n\n\nG. We have extremists on every side......there are extremists who want to ban guns and every thing sharp and then we have sardars who tout RPG''s in Interior Sindh and Balochistan -_- that has to end right now. We want our guns and we want them legalized. We want licencing. We want reasonable back ground checks and an accountable NADRA not the hack job idiocy they are pulling along with Chauhdry Nisar''s whimsical wishes. Allow universal ownership subject to back ground checks and medical and you will see a lot of our problems disappear.\n\n\nI will never support anti automatic talk, I will never support disarmament. We are a free people who are from martial tribes and are proud of our warrior heritage.\n[B]\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000]*TO TOP IT ALL OFF INDIANS CONSTANTLY MAKE REFERENCE TO OUR POPULATIONS FIRE ARMS OWNERSHIP AS A SEVERE PROBLEM WHICH THEIR FORCES WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO FACE IF THEY EVER MAKE HEADWAY INTO OUR TERRITORY.

(649448, ' [QUOTE=Survivalist;485434]Dear Abass, Thanks for contacting and initiating this valuable thread,\n\nIn April 2015, I brainstormed some recommendations and sent to MoI. I would like to contribute the same to this thread.\n\nFirearm Regulatory Reforms Recommendations for MOI by NAS/Survivalist April 2015:\nIssues & Problems:\n1.    Fake licenses due to inefficient data entry, storage and retrieval systems.\n2.    No mandatory pre-issuance SoPs or ID cross check. \n3.    Untraceable fired bullets until firearm is captured, as there is no record of licensed firearm bullet and spent cartridge marks. \n4.    Firearm Smuggling (buyers willing to pay high prices for firearms not available)\n5.    Fake firearm copies made locally for hunting/ sport purposes.) \n6.    Tax evasion, as firearm sold for a million rupee is recorded as 20,000 only.\n7.    No checks on how (through what means) foreign made firearms  imported/purchased and no track record of change of ownership.\n8.    Illegal Import & Trade, through changing of papers, records and paying bribe at every stage.\n9.    Current law and policy has grey areas, gaps and implementation issues, such as maximum allowed caliber for handguns is 44 inch, it is larger than the diameter of largest gun/tank on earth. It should be 44 Bore instead. Policy makers do not understand difference between bore, its equivalent in mm and differences. Similarly .22 caliber is a group of calibers that includes smallest (.22 short and long rifle bullet) to .223 (a larger bullet for hunting and 5.56 for military use as well) as well.\n10.    Incapacity and capability (in "arms branches" at DCO offices) of keeping and maintaining record, reviewing applications and examining eligibility of applicant for license of firearm. This leads to backdoors and corruption. One can obtain an arms license much easier than a driving license.\n11.    Situation is better at record keeping and issuing licenses after involvement of NADRA but authorization process is still doubtful.\n12.    Firearm regulations do not include written specifications for the lawful safe storage of private firearms and ammunition by licensed gun owners as part of the licensing process. T\n\n\nFirearms Policy Reforms and Recommendations\n\n1.    A provincial board/independent oganization with district level presence should be established to develop firearm licensing and control policy, strategy and guidelines and implementation thereof. \n\n2.    Board /organization to have representation from armed forces (firearm and shooting sports experts), NADRA, PITB, civil society, hunting community, shooting sportsmen, businessmen and firing range handlers.\n\n3.    A stringent criteria / procedure  be introduced for issuing arms licenses;\na.    Applicant should be examined psychologically.\nb.    Character certificate and police report should be made mandatory.\nc.    Applicant should pass an exam and interview related to firearm safety, handling & storage precautions and use of firearm as well as awareness regarding prevailing law for hunting, shooting sports, carrying firearms and use of firearms for in-house, in-vehicle and personal self-defense.\n\n4.    A system and software  to acquire fired bullet projectile from firearm (that applicant purchased from vendor), scan projectile and spent case for signature marks of firearm and store in database, should be developed and implemented. (A patent application pending in USPTO in this regard)\n\n5.    Above mentioned system will serve as reference point and database for law enforcement and criminal investigation agencies for detection of firearm if a licensed firearm is used in an incident or crime.\n\n6.    Licenses should be categorized as follows;\n \na.    Hunting Sports\nb.    Shooting Sports\nc.    Enthusiast\nd.    Self Defense\ne.    Special Needs\nf.    Security Agency\n \n\n7.    A proof for para 6 claim from applicant should be provided, for example membership card of firing range, membership of hunting sports organization, hunting license, recommendations for amateurs from two existing  members etc.\n\n8.    A database of hunters  be maintained by the licensing wildlife department and shooting sportsmen by shooting sports organizations.\n\n9.    Following are recommendations for firearms for which licenses should be allowed;\n\na.    All shotguns except &#8220;FULL AUTO&#8221; allowed as full auto shotgun is not meant for any sports or self-defense purpose.\nb.    All handguns of any caliber except &#8220;FULL AUTO&#8221; for same reason as above.\nc.    All rifles of .17, .22 (Types: Short, Long Rifle & Magnum) calibers.\nd.    Rifles for hunting purpose only for all caliber up to (.336 bore or 8mm) with magazine capacity of &#8220;8 Bullets maximum&#8221; except &#8220;FULL AUTO&#8221;. Please note that most full auto or military firearms have more than 8 (usually 20 or 30) bullets magazines.\ne.    Para 9(d) firearms/rifles common calibers are .223, .243, .270, .300, .308, 30-06, .336, 5.56 mm, 7mm, 8mm.\nf.    All pneumatic/air/CO2 pistols and guns should be license free. These are commonly called Air Guns or Air Rifles.\ng.    Cartridge purchase limit should be 500 for shooting sports and 50 for others. While limit to keep any time should be 10000 for sportsmen and 500 for others. Please note that usually sportsmen shoot 200 to 500 rounds for practice in one session or day. These statistic can be verified from any range master (Lahore Rifle Club, Wah/Shaheen Shooting Range or Guns Club, Islamabad). These sportsmen earn fame and medals for our country.\nh.    Hunting & Sports firearms should be kept secure and locked at homes or storage location and department/office should be pre-informed of the location and arrangement. \ni.    Shooting a hunting or sports firearm within municipal/city area should be completely prohibited for any purpose except use at firing ranges.\nj.    All shooting for "joy and celebration/ shooting in air" should be totally prohibited and punishable by law. \nk.    SPECIAL CATEGORY (currently it is called &#8220;prohibited&#8221; that is misleading as licenses are issued as PB) should include following;\ni.    Pakistan Ordinance Factory (POF) has designed and manufacturing a range of firearms in 9mm and 308 sporting calibers. There should be an arrangement with POF to allow public sales and licenses for these firearms. This will help eradicate arms smuggling, illegal trade and fake licensing business and boost our economy as well as feel us proud to own firearm made by national company. \nii.    POF can be asked to include .223/5.56 hunting and sports caliber in production range. These firearms should not be &#8220;FULL AUTO&#8221;.\niii.    Only POF made .223 &#8220;NOT FULL AUTO&#8221; with 20 round magazine should be available to masses as a SPECIAL CATEGORY weapon.\niv.    This should only be licensed to retired or in service military or civilian servicemen and women, security agencies, engineers, doctors, teachers/professors, IT professionals, expatriates, scientists, agriculturists, highly qualified persons and tax-payers (with a certain minimum limit).\nl.     Awareness should be created regarding types and categories of firearms and cartridges. It is to be noted that even those who make policy or implement it are not well aware of various types and uses of firearms and their bullets.\nm.    Firearm traders and shopkeepers should be scrutinized and a software application should be made in which they record all purchases/sales and corresponding information promptly in real time (like NADRA system upload).\nn.    All FULL AUTO weapons should be made prohibited (No license should be issued to ANYONE in any category). Firearm used by our military/security forces including AK-47 (Kalashnikov), HK G3 and MP5 (full auto) should be banned for possession of civilians. As well as anti-material, anti bullet proof (armour piercing) or incendiary bullets be made non accessible and prohibited for civilian use.\no.    A guidebook of firearms, their safety precautions, governing laws and rules, exam sample and contacts should be published and made mandatory for every firearm holder. \np.    Manual of firearm should be produced by applicant as mandatory and scanned and recorded by department/concerned office.\nq.    Change/modification of weapons/firearms to FULL AUTO mode by any means should be completely prohibited.\nSome quick facts in this regard are also of interest;\n1.    7mm and 7.62 are different calibers and even 7.62 comprises various calibers (like 7.62x39 i.e. Kalashnikov, 7.62x51 (military G3 or civil 308, 7.62x54 is popular hunting cartridge).\n2.    308 is civilian version of 7.62x51 military cartridge used in G3.\n3.    POF is making very good quality and product range of civilian use/sporting firearms, even it exports to USA and western countries. We should benefit from POF by allowing sales to our own country/civilians.\n4.    Pakguns.com is an excellent enthusiast community with highly experienced and regarded moderators/senior members of military, hunting and shooting sports origin. It has thousands members and increasing.\n5.    Some glock pistols and imported 222/223 rifles can be modified to full auto and thereby falling in prohibited category. POF has made it impossible for their guns to be reverted to FULL AUTO.\n6.    Sportsmen earn fame and repute for the country and its citizens. They should be allowed to import (through Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Commerce) firearm (say 5 in a lifetime) of their choice from abroad without tax and duties through quick mechanism, no bribery and hurdles.\n7.    Firearm suppressors (commonly called silencers) should be explicitly banned for any firearm except .22 caliber. This .22 caliber is used for sporting and at ranges and suppressors keep these quiet.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nSorry man on the "Sports club" thing I cant agree with you as I am not rich enough to go hunting big game in Thar or the Northern areas. CHAPS is unreasonable and defunct and many of our esteemed community members are crack pots with ego issues who will push and pull people into their clubs at whims this will further exacerbate the problem....imagine that idiot at "Majeed Sons Lahore" opening a gun club -_- 99% of us cant pass his "khandani" check list even though that baboon cant even pronounce "I am busy" correctly. I am pro auto as well as pro reform of regulations which will allow "accountable imports". Give licences as a matter of policy if a person can pass the back ground check and medical exam ( that will include psycho analysis) then what the problem. Terrorists dont ask for licences to buy their guns. I think that has become quite the highlight in the last decade of operations.', ''),
(649449, ' And again sorry for my caustic approach but attitude problems are a major issue with our community and we need to accept that. Moreover folks proposing restriction and repossession of automatics usually own quite a healthy number of them themselves. That is very interesting isnt it. I think its more of a class thing then? the dynamics of this particular question are worthy of being commissioned into a university research project.\n\n\nSame is the issue with import licences. These same "big wigs" have made the trade into a club privilege ensuring that only they can get their permits vetted and have their shipments cleared. I remember when I was ranting on about the PPP and how they will damage the status of the middle class licence owner and guess what we suffered the most. the big wigs remained licence savy while ours suffered cancellation or revalidation''s or blanket bans etc etc etc. \n\n\nThe remedy to these problems is universal licencing,first come first serve import licencing, CID Police operated and FIA operated back ground checks, local Civil hospital medical exam including psyche analyses. For all of the above. Allow automatics and rifle calibres like the 3o3 and ban the RPG''s and AP-9''s that these same big wigs give to their security details.\n\n\nI dont care if I am banned after this as hey I was invited to share a piece of my mind about this :p', ''),

Granted it may be manufactured outside of the UK but the branding is still English. \r\nI don''t think English shotguns are as common or as readily available in Pakistan, I maybe wrong but certainly not in our punjab area - that''s probably why I think they hold a certain novalty factor. \r\nThis isn''t the first one that I have transported to Pakistan, before this was a beautiful side by side with wonderful engraved Damascus barrels by an old English maker by the name of Rutt - still in Pakistan.

My license has been submitted since April 2015 and still no messages received for fees yet. I and a few members have been patiently waiting for the messages to come through. Called Nadra for status multiple times and have got same response that approval is awaited for a DCO level. \r\n\r\nLimit of 200rounds also not entertained at the nadra centre, so will have to get that changed ultimately. Good if any member can share their experience in this regard.\r\n\r\nMy license is of 2009 era, pls shed some light of when your book was made. It has been through 3 weapons change, a bore change and extra arms tax valid till December 2016. All DCOs entries made and verified as well but still DCO office slow in verifying the license. Well now looking into "alternative" ways of getting the process quickly started.', ''),

If scope height is known, there is a function in Chairgun that calculates the BC of a pellet/gun combo by zeroing the gun at a known range and then noting the change in POI at a known greater distance.

(649930, ' Hello Kamranwali,\n\nWhat I have understood is that you want to calculate The speed of pellet (FPS) with a gun. Correct me if I am wrong.\n\nRegarding BC, I think it is solely property of pellet ( in the air) and has nothing to do with barrel.\n\nWickipedia gives this definition,  "In [URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics"]ballistics[/URL], the [B]ballistic coefficient[/B] ([B]BC[/B]) of a body is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight. It is [URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversely_proportional"]inversely proportional[/URL]  to the negative acceleration — a high number indicates a low negative  acceleration. This is roughly the same as saying that the projectile in  question possesses low drag, although some meaning is lost in the  generalization. BC is a function of mass, diameter, and [URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient"]drag coefficient"[/URL].  Ballistic coefficient for most famous pellet brands is known and given in pellet database of Chairgun Pro.\n\nBy plotting a graph of zeroing and then fall of pellet at different distances, and then taking help from Chairgun, you can calculate FPS, but I doubt it is true FPS. Exact FPS and flb energy can only be known by a good quality CHRONOGRAPH.', ''),

So, try to make your life simple, Hope you understood what I am up to.\n\nBallistic coefficient is determines the ability of a pellet to deal with the air resistance. It depends on pellet weight, shape, size, material used, consistency and velocity. A powerful gun will produce more velocity, and a weaker gun will produce less velocity, and the moment pellet exits the muzzle velocity starts changing. BC has nothing to do PARTICULARLY with a barrel. It is whole gun which produces velocity.\n\nAnd more so, BC is used mostly to compare efficiency of pellets and for comparison purpose, the given values are just fine.', ''),

Later I owned a 303. First was the small paratrooper version. I exchanged it for the regular 303 hoping that the longer barrel with increase accuracy and range. I could not make satisfactory groups with either. I even mounted telescopes on both rifles and shot wild boar at over 100 yards. The main problem I was facing was the vicious kick of both. I mounted thick recoil pads, but still the kick was there and gave me bruised shoulders having problem with shotgun over the weekend. I finally changed it for 7x57 and am satisfied with the results. I gave up all the ammo I had collected over the years to last a lifetime. It included POF ammo and ammo on sale in the market during Afghan War.

The Paikhawar Chapter of PG along with few honorary members from the twin cities did test fire the Sporter almost a month back. In those 110 rounds that we shot, We didn''t face any issue related to FTF or FTE and the rifle went flawless. On that day, the maximum distance available to us at the range was only 200m and in the end it became quite boring when with each shot we were able to successfully hit the bricks. YES, you heard that right, we were using bricks as targets because in our heightened excitement, we forgot to take along proper paper targets. Pity…\nThe only issue which I am currently facing with the setup is that the steel rings that came with Leupold Scope are low profile and thus the optic cannot be properly seated on the Picatinny rail. So I had to revert to those inexpensive Chinese 30mm rings which were somewhat high profile. I am of the belief that there is still a significant gap for improvement in accuracy if and when proper 30mm rings with high profile are installed on the rifle. I will highly appreciate help and guidance from fellow members in procuring these rings. \n\n[QUOTE=Fraz;487748]People have not expressed their interest in the weapon, this may be a reason for him to not post the review here.[/QUOTE]\nlol & No Comment.\n\n[QUOTE=Col;487752]The main reason for minimal interest is that members are not getting permission to buy these rifles...\nOtherwise .308 thats too in semi auto is ideal round for long range shooting...\nAnd it will become most popular as soon as people get access to this beauty..\nWell there is [B]good news for karachi[/B] enthusiasts , but a friend [B]restricted me[/B] to disclose...\nSoon it [B]will be a wildfire[/B][/QUOTE]\nWell; you said and you didn’t.\n\n[QUOTE=Nazim Sahib;486591]Wow @Jibz.....you POF Sporter looks MUCH better then before!\nAmazing work![/QUOTE]\nMost Manana, Nazim Sb.\n\n[QUOTE=FA226;486600]MashaAllah look very impressive now.\nIt will be more fun if you put the flash supressor and 20rd mag.[/QUOTE]\nThank you Roor. For obvious reasons, at the moment I would refrain from giving the Sporter an Assault Rifle’s profile so installing a Flash Hider/Suppressor is not on the list. As far as the 20 round mag is concerned, I did find one and it worked perfectly fine with the rifle and thankfully my earlier concerns that Sporter may not be compatible with Combat-Rifle accessories turned out to be unwarranted.

(650191, ' [QUOTE=Jibz;487760]Roor. Apologies for the delay in my response. The Paikhawar Chapter of PG along with few honorary members from the twin cities did test fire the Sporter almost a month back. In those 110 rounds that we shot, We didn''t face any issue related to FTF or FTE and the rifle went flawless. On that day, the maximum distance available to us at the range was only 200m and in the end it became quite boring when with each shot we were able to successfully hit the bricks. YES, you heard that right, we were using bricks as targets because in our heightened excitement, we forgot to take along proper paper targets. Pity…\nThe only issue which I am currently facing with the setup is that the steel rings that came with Leupold Scope are low profile and thus the optic cannot be properly seated on the Picatinny rail. So I had to revert to those inexpensive Chinese 30mm rings which were somewhat high profile. I am of the belief that there is still a significant gap for improvement in accuracy if and when proper 30mm rings with high profile are installed on the rifle. I will highly appreciate help and guidance from fellow members in procuring these rings. \n\n\nlol & No Comment.\n\n\nWell; you said and you didn’t.\n\n\nMost Manana, Nazim Sb.\n\n\nThank you Roor. For obvious reasons, at the moment I would refrain from giving the Sporter an Assault Rifle’s profile so installing a Flash Hider/Suppressor is not on the list. As far as the 20 round mag is concerned, I did find one and it worked perfectly fine with the rifle and thankfully my earlier concerns that Sporter may not be compatible with Combat-Rifle accessories turned out to be unwarranted. I believe that for range shooting and hunting, the 5 round mag (which in fact is a 6 round mag) suffices and is more practical.[/QUOTE]\n\nVery well done. you can get 30 mm rings or 25mm rings that fit on the 1913 picatiny rail from Lahore.

(650331, ' The season''s first hunt for our gang (comprising of Colt1911 and I) was on last weekend. The hunting grounds; outskirts of Kohat and the game bird, my favorite, the gray and black Francolin. As usual and quite typical of our local hunting buddies there, we started off very very late. It was almost 11am when we reached the game area and by then the early hours of the bird''s feeding time was over and they were nestling in bushes. [FONT=Verdana]Well, I crib about this problem each and every time and by now I should have gotten used to it but anyways. The weather was quite pleasant and this time fortunately we had two pointers with us,"Nikoo" and "Moti". Interestingly, Moti could understand commands in both Pashto and Punjabi. [/FONT][FONT=Verdana]\nRight in the beginning of the hunt, I stepped on Nikoo''s front paw by mistake and the poor chap whined for a long time as all its paws were already hurt from previous hunts. Felt very sorry for it as after that his head rather his paw was not in the game and was very sluggish throughout the day. On the other hand, Moti was taking his TORs very seriously. He was very quick on his feet and was running almost 30 meters ahead of us and thus causing the birds to fly off way ahead of us reaching those spots. I believe its master needs to train Moti and tone-down its enthusiasm  so that he doesn''t wander off far from the formation. \n\n\n[/FONT][URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/Hunting%20in%20Kohat%20Jabbai%20Nov%2009%202014/Photo2124_zpsuaudd54l.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/Hunting%20in%20Kohat%20Jabbai%20Nov%2009%202014/Photo2124_zpsuaudd54l.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nA local boy "Yahya" aged 6 joined us during the day and Mannnn, he talked and talked and talked.

I had to edit this one as well because there was a lot of discussion taking place along with reload gaps etc. Due to a maxed-up digital zoom and lowering of resolution (For ease of upload), I will have to explain the point of Aim then Impact of each shot. \n\nThe [B][U]First[/U][/B] and [B][U]Second[/U][/B] shot are only an inch apart and are almost 8 inches to the right of the white centre target at exactly 3 o Clock. I adjusted the Windage Turret by giving it 32 clicks to the left. \n\nThe [B][U]Third[/U][/B] Shot was right in the centre of the white patch.\n\nNow to ensure that the BDC function of the scope was properly working, I brought down the reading on the Elevation Turret from 7 to 4. \n\nThe next six shots are exactly at 6 o Clock and are almost 14 inches lower than the white center patch on the target. I was happy to know that both the turrets on my used scope were working perfectly fine. \n \n(The shots were taken in laying down position with left palm under the foregrip of the rifle)\n\n[COLOR=#ff0000][B][U]VIDEO:\n[/U][/B][/COLOR]\n[video]http://vid1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Movie_zpsenuauvlj.mp4[/video]', ''),

Dear All,\n\nCan you please guide me on how to shoot 9mm pistols correctly, I have been going to the range and tried Beretta 92, Glock 17L and Sig P226-X5.\n\nBest results till date were achieved with Sig P226-X5 at 15 meters where I was able to put all the rounds within the paper (still a bad 8 to 10 inches group). The main difference I observed was a lighter and consistent trigger pull, below 5 Lbs for the X5 as it is a competition pistol.\n\nFor Beretta 92, I feel the trigger is quite heavy for me, after the little play, my finger comes to complete halt as the trigger reaches the snap point, then I have to apply extra pressure and that causes the jerk which puts the barrel out of line with the target at the last moment.\n\nFor the Glock, I felt the overall pistol to be very light and as a result, I am quite unable to control it during firing and the worst shots I ever made were with Glock, totally off target.\n\nMy shooting with rifles is much better, I scored 100/100 with 22LR rifle at 25 meters and 90/100 with 223 Blaser sniper rifle at 100, 200 and 300 meters.\n\nCan someone guide me how to better control a 9mm pistol for more accurate shooting?', ''),

(650497, 'Sharp Love. Art is a relative term. Some find it in abstract things and some see it in nature. What do you call the process of turning a block of steel into a pure utility survival tool. For me that''s Art. The right amount of chromium and vanadium and than the mind boggling process of choosing the right steel. Endless possibilities you can mix and match everything but to make the tool that balances everything and is just the right thing is really a work of art. You have all sorts of low to high end steels like, 420HC, 440HC, 18crmov, 1095, Aus8, vg1 and sv30. The list goes on and on. Some are high carbon some are stainless. Some sacrifice edge retention for hardness some sacrifice hardness for edge retention for hardness, Some sacrifice edge retention for rust prevention. Endless possibilities. The manufacturer weighs all the odds and produces one final product that will surprise you.\r\nIf we look at it it truly is a work of art the heat treatment of steels to last finishing touches. If it wasn''t art you would probably get a ugly looking deformed thing. \r\nIf you use these tools you will develop a bond with each and everyone. Every piece will have its own story to tell. From batoning to skinning game meat to every day carry or to take it with you in the field. It will become a part of you. If not you could just admire its sheer beauty like i do and make them safe queens. There is no end to it once you get into this. From the cheap Mora''s to the higher end Chris reeves each and everyone has its own place and a snob value. \r\nThey asked me what will you do these cut vegetables. No, I just collect them. The sharpness makes you contemplate better and puts you in a trance. I respect them, Just as I respect other guns. You must know the right use of these magnificent tools which although we use in our daily life''s but are neglected and overlooked.\r\n[B]Fools take a knife and stab people in the back,The wise take a knife cut the cord and set themselves free from the fools[/B]\r\nIts a dangerous affair a bad romance. If you get into it. Take this moment sit back and think when was the last time you used a knife and appreciate it. From the blade tip to the pommel its all art, Its just how you look at it.\r\nIf you ask me, Like i said. I don''t use knife, I collect them. Its like having wolves at your command. So much power yet so sane.\r\nIf you were in that dilemma  of finding a purpose or being restless. Go and buy a knife. It might just do the trick.', ''),

(650608, ' Salam,\r\nReference to my previous post in the same thread, i was waiting for the vortek tuning kit for my D34, but its going to take time. Anyhow, i already had the OEM replacement parts with me, so I just put them in instead. Got the right lube (Deathrow Bro guided me where to get them from), took off rough edges, polished/deburred everything and put the gun back together. The gun dieseled for abt 30-40 shots and then it settled. Gave it some time to break in, around 250 shots later zeroed it at 25 yards and started shooting.\r\n\r\nNow comes the fun part, one of my aunts was after me for quite some time to shoot a crow or two for her since they are a menace in rural areas and keep stealing/soiling edible stuff, but the crows over there know me pretty well :D and wont give me a chance to shoot them, they just fly away as soon as they see me. I was sitting in the hujra with two of my cuzins, and we see a crow sitting in a "toot" tree quite some distance away. My cuzin asks me if it is possible to hit the crow from that distance, i said well we can try. The AO on my scope told me that crow is around 80-85 yards away, the angle, as i judged it, was abt 30 degrees. I have been playing around with chairgun, and i knew i had to hold abt 12-14 inches over the crow, which happened to be the 3rd mildot below the crosshair at 6x magnification. The crow didn''t even notice me since it was so far away, and i had a table in front me on which i placed my left elbow, giving me a lot of stability. I aimed, breathing long and slow, held my breath and squeezed off the shot.... a few milliseconds of delay and THWAAK!!! The crow didn''t even flinch, instant light outs :)\r\n\r\nLater, we measured the distance with strides, it was 89 strides which should be around 80 yards, I''m going to take along a measuring tape next time i go so that i can get an exact reading. It was sitting at least 5-6 yards up in the tree. \r\n\r\nI was using H&N FTT 5.53, in a spring gun that is just lube tuned. So I hope that can put airgun power in its true perspective to all that read. A gun doing 15 fpe is more than enough for a crow at around 80 yards, if you do your part, so it should be good for smaller game out to a 100. Yes you''re going to miss too, but if you connect it has enough retained power to do the job. And the pellet used is very important, as important as the gun.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

At closer ranges it MIGHT(but I doubt that too), but not at the range you''re talking about. Also, you''d have a very hard time finding a scope for a Big Cat, cause I think its a magnum IIRC. The CP scopes available are good for AGs that are around the power of your Shadow, they wont hold up to the punishment and you''ll have to get a magnum rated scope from abroad.\n\nBy the way, what pellets are you using with your Shadow? I ask because the Shadow is around the power of a D34, and I think you can easily reach out to a 100 yards with the right pellet for plinking. If your thinking of printing real small groups on paper, well then you''ll definitely need to go to the Dark Side(Read: PCP!!!)\n\n@umair4it, bro if you could kindly share your collection with us, your experience with them......would love to know.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(650713, ' Salam,\nyou''re more than welcome bro, we r all here to share and learn from each other. :) \n\n1.  I have the CP on my D34, I put it on the D52 because my my 34 had a broken spring. Around 20 or so shots, the illumination knob was almost falling out. I took it off and had to open the knob and tighten the screws. That''s why I don''t think it''ll hold on a magnum springer. The only option I was left with was to ask someone to bring me a magnum rated scope from abroad, it should be here next week, but it cost me 120 pounds. Also, my D52 has quite some droop, so had to get a Sportsmatch AOP55 which cost another 40 pounds. The leapers should be around 9k, mounts another 1k and its very very heavy.\n\n2. Please Read this\n    [url]http://www.airriflehunter.com/the-gamo-big-cat-22-caliber-air-rifle/[/url]\n    After market trigger will again need to be gotten from abroad for even more $.\n \n3. Heavy pellets, not available. You''ll have to constantly bug ppl from abroad to bring them for you.\n    35k????? unbelievable!!! it costs a 119 dollars in america. That''s like 3 times the actual price, Maybe the dealers want it to be the glock of airguns :D . Brother, do not, and I repeat DO NOT buy this gun. You''d be much better off with a Diana 34. It''ll cost you around 30k, another 7-8k with the scope and mounts. Much better deal, as it costs around 300 dollars in the states as well. ALL PARTS AVAILABLE, very easy to work on, wonderful t-06 trigger.

(650729, ' Salam,\nAs always a pleasure D3AD Bro.\n\nGood decision. let the Big Cat "sleep" :D\n\nThe limitations are not with the 34, the limitation is with 22 pellet. a 22 will always drop, even with a magnum and a pcp. its actually your job to test this drop at different distances, for any given zero distance, and to figure out what works the best. All serious shooters "map" their gun this way.\nPigeon size quarry can be taken out to 80 yards(since I''ve experienced it first hand). Actually a good pellet is equally important. For example, the ftt is a good pellet with a good BC, if you take 15.5 fpe as starting energy, it should have 6.96 fpe left in it at 100 yards. So, if you are an EXCEPTIONAL shot, I think it''ll do even at 100 yards. Also, this will depend on how accurately you judge distance to the target and compensate for wind.\nI would advise against the duck thing, you''ll hit it because its a big target, but will you down it?? I don''t really know.\n\nI have no experience with the Shadow, but from what I''ve read, they''re almost the same power, Accuracy should be higher because of the trigger and recoil lower due to heavier weight.\n\nThe 48(same power plant as a 52 and 54) is also a magnum and a known scope eater. Be ready to increase your scope and mount budget as well. But 14-15 grain pellets can be used.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(650777, ' Well, before making a dual limb for crossbow I thought of incorporating a thick SPRING STEEL WIRE in the PPRC pipe I have been using.\n\nI have worked with spring steel wire earlier to make a crossbow limb. Efficiency of this steel wire was much better than PPRC, and that small crossbow worked perfectly but I Abandoned the idea because if a steel wire breaks during cocking and firing, it could seriously injure shooter or some bystander.\n\nNow, I have used an even stronger steel wire. This is the wire which is used in making high quality industrial springs and is very responsive.\n\nI have taken 36 inches of wire with ends turned to small hooks by mechanic. It is pushed in to a 1 inch internal dia 37 inches long PPRC  pipe. Exactly centered, and it fit bit tightly.\n This wire + pipe complex is heated and flattened in a slightly different way and stringed, using it as a limb of crossbow.\n\n[ATTACH]36046[/ATTACH]\n\nNow actual power is coming from steel wire with added strength and power from PPRC pipe. Additionally the wire even if snaps, cant come loose and injure anyone as it is snug fitted inside the pipe.\n\nI have fired just few shots and it seems to be a really powerful string breaker.\n\nI have noticed that as the limb is bit longer so I can increase the draw length by about 2 inches giving it even more power.\n\nThat I will do tomorrow.', ''),

Everything else remains as it was.\n\n\nSo, my friend had a bunch of FA and DD, which he bought in the early 1960s.  He had the machine guns DEWATed--DEactivated WAr Trophy--by welding the breeches and bolt faces.  At the time, that was sufficient. Now, you have to chop the receiver.\n\nBut he had them all on license, and notified the government of the conversion.  So they''re all on paper.\n\nWhat he didn''t realize is DEWATs can be REACTIVATED by changing the license status for a $200 fee.\n\nSo he had a bunch of dummy guns he loaned to a museum, then took back when it closed.\n\nHe''s now looking for the papers, because he assumed they were just non-guns. But, even as that, they''re valuable collectibles.  As DEWATs, they''re worth ten times as much. And if the papers are on hand to reactivate, they''re worth five times THAT.\n\nHe just casually mentioned, "Oh, a Lewis Gun, a Maxim, a Hotchkiss, a Madsen, Thompson, German MP18, an MP44, an MG42, some Soviet mortars, a Boyes Rifle, I think there''s a DP28 in there, Japanese Type 99 machine gun, a rocket launcher..."\n\nHe has no siblings and no children.  I''m persuading him that my firearm/family law attorney should set up so he can place them in trust, with instructions to either sell or donate them to a museum when he dies, otherwise they''ll wind up chopped to shreds, dumped, or sold as unpapered dummies and have to have the receivers cut.\n\nHe bought them for a few dollars each back then--$9 for the rocket launcher, and he mentioned $50 for the mortar.\n\nA functional MG42 goes for about $45,000.\n\nThen there''s the sabers, uniforms, pistols, rifles, documents, holsters...', ''),

(650846, ' [QUOTE=MichaelZWilliamson;488435]Brief background: As of 1934, in the US, full auto, short barrel, destructive devices and silencers had to be registered with a $200 tax.\n\nIn 1968, there was a brief amnesty to register anything that had been forgotten.\n\nAs of 1986, no new full auto are allowed, but can be sold under license. Everything else remains as it was.\n\n\nSo, my friend had a bunch of FA and DD, which he bought in the early 1960s.  He had the machine guns DEWATed--DEactivated WAr Trophy--by welding the breeches and bolt faces.  At the time, that was sufficient. Now, you have to chop the receiver.\n\nBut he had them all on license, and notified the government of the conversion.  So they''re all on paper.\n\nWhat he didn''t realize is DEWATs can be REACTIVATED by changing the license status for a $200 fee.\n\nSo he had a bunch of dummy guns he loaned to a museum, then took back when it closed.\n\nHe''s now looking for the papers, because he assumed they were just non-guns. But, even as that, they''re valuable collectibles.  As DEWATs, they''re worth ten times as much. And if the papers are on hand to reactivate, they''re worth five times THAT.\n\nHe just casually mentioned, "Oh, a Lewis Gun, a Maxim, a Hotchkiss, a Madsen, Thompson, German MP18, an MP44, an MG42, some Soviet mortars, a Boyes Rifle, I think there''s a DP28 in there, Japanese Type 99 machine gun, a rocket launcher..."\n\nHe has no siblings and no children.  I''m persuading him that my firearm/family law attorney should set up so he can place them in trust, with instructions to either sell or donate them to a museum when he dies, otherwise they''ll wind up chopped to shreds, dumped, or sold as unpapered dummies and have to have the receivers cut.\n\nHe bought them for a few dollars each back then--$9 for the rocket launcher, and he mentioned $50 for the mortar.\n\nA functional MG42 goes for about $45,000.\n\nThen there''s the sabers, uniforms, pistols, rifles, documents, holsters...[/QUOTE]\n\n\nIm confused. \n\nWhat exactly does your friend need help with?

(650899, ' [QUOTE=Survivalist;485434]Dear Abass, Thanks for contacting and initiating this valuable thread,\n\nIn April 2015, I brainstormed some recommendations and sent to MoI. I would like to contribute the same to this thread.\n\nFirearm Regulatory Reforms Recommendations for MOI by NAS/Survivalist April 2015:\nIssues & Problems:\n1.    Fake licenses due to inefficient data entry, storage and retrieval systems.\n2.    No mandatory pre-issuance SoPs or ID cross check. \n3.    Untraceable fired bullets until firearm is captured, as there is no record of licensed firearm bullet and spent cartridge marks. \n4.    Firearm Smuggling (buyers willing to pay high prices for firearms not available)\n5.    Fake firearm copies made locally for hunting/ sport purposes.) \n6.    Tax evasion, as firearm sold for a million rupee is recorded as 20,000 only.\n7.    No checks on how (through what means) foreign made firearms  imported/purchased and no track record of change of ownership.\n8.    Illegal Import & Trade, through changing of papers, records and paying bribe at every stage.\n9.    Current law and policy has grey areas, gaps and implementation issues, such as maximum allowed caliber for handguns is 44 inch, it is larger than the diameter of largest gun/tank on earth. It should be 44 Bore instead. Policy makers do not understand difference between bore, its equivalent in mm and differences. Similarly .22 caliber is a group of calibers that includes smallest (.22 short and long rifle bullet) to .223 (a larger bullet for hunting and 5.56 for military use as well) as well.\n10.    Incapacity and capability (in "arms branches" at DCO offices) of keeping and maintaining record, reviewing applications and examining eligibility of applicant for license of firearm. This leads to backdoors and corruption. One can obtain an arms license much easier than a driving license.\n11.    Situation is better at record keeping and issuing licenses after involvement of NADRA but authorization process is still doubtful.\n12.    Firearm regulations do not include written specifications for the lawful safe storage of private firearms and ammunition by licensed gun owners as part of the licensing process. T\n\n\nFirearms Policy Reforms and Recommendations\n\n1.    A provincial board/independent oganization with district level presence should be established to develop firearm licensing and control policy, strategy and guidelines and implementation thereof. \n\n2.    Board /organization to have representation from armed forces (firearm and shooting sports experts), NADRA, PITB, civil society, hunting community, shooting sportsmen, businessmen and firing range handlers.\n\n3.    A stringent criteria / procedure  be introduced for issuing arms licenses;\na.    Applicant should be examined psychologically.\nb.    Character certificate and police report should be made mandatory.\nc.    Applicant should pass an exam and interview related to firearm safety, handling & storage precautions and use of firearm as well as awareness regarding prevailing law for hunting, shooting sports, carrying firearms and use of firearms for in-house, in-vehicle and personal self-defense.\n\n4.    A system and software  to acquire fired bullet projectile from firearm (that applicant purchased from vendor), scan projectile and spent case for signature marks of firearm and store in database, should be developed and implemented. (A patent application pending in USPTO in this regard)\n\n5.    Above mentioned system will serve as reference point and database for law enforcement and criminal investigation agencies for detection of firearm if a licensed firearm is used in an incident or crime.\n\n6.    Licenses should be categorized as follows;\n \na.    Hunting Sports\nb.    Shooting Sports\nc.    Enthusiast\nd.    Self Defense\ne.    Special Needs\nf.    Security Agency\n \n\n7.    A proof for para 6 claim from applicant should be provided, for example membership card of firing range, membership of hunting sports organization, hunting license, recommendations for amateurs from two existing  members etc.\n\n8.    A database of hunters  be maintained by the licensing wildlife department and shooting sportsmen by shooting sports organizations.\n\n9.    Following are recommendations for firearms for which licenses should be allowed;\n\na.    All shotguns except “FULL AUTO” allowed as full auto shotgun is not meant for any sports or self-defense purpose.\nb.    All handguns of any caliber except “FULL AUTO” for same reason as above.\nc.    All rifles of .17, .22 (Types: Short, Long Rifle & Magnum) calibers.\nd.    Rifles for hunting purpose only for all caliber up to (.336 bore or 8mm) with magazine capacity of “8 Bullets maximum” except “FULL AUTO”. Please note that most full auto or military firearms have more than 8 (usually 20 or 30) bullets magazines.\ne.    Para 9(d) firearms/rifles common calibers are .223, .243, .270, .300, .308, 30-06, .336, 5.56 mm, 7mm, 8mm.\nf.    All pneumatic/air/CO2 pistols and guns should be license free. These are commonly called Air Guns or Air Rifles.\ng.    Cartridge purchase limit should be 500 for shooting sports and 50 for others. While limit to keep any time should be 10000 for sportsmen and 500 for others. Please note that usually sportsmen shoot 200 to 500 rounds for practice in one session or day. These statistic can be verified from any range master (Lahore Rifle Club, Wah/Shaheen Shooting Range or Guns Club, Islamabad). These sportsmen earn fame and medals for our country.\nh.    Hunting & Sports firearms should be kept secure and locked at homes or storage location and department/office should be pre-informed of the location and arrangement. \ni.    Shooting a hunting or sports firearm within municipal/city area should be completely prohibited for any purpose except use at firing ranges.\nj.    All shooting for "joy and celebration/ shooting in air" should be totally prohibited and punishable by law. \nk.    SPECIAL CATEGORY (currently it is called “prohibited” that is misleading as licenses are issued as PB) should include following;\ni.    Pakistan Ordinance Factory (POF) has designed and manufacturing a range of firearms in 9mm and 308 sporting calibers. There should be an arrangement with POF to allow public sales and licenses for these firearms. This will help eradicate arms smuggling, illegal trade and fake licensing business and boost our economy as well as feel us proud to own firearm made by national company. \nii.    POF can be asked to include .223/5.56 hunting and sports caliber in production range. These firearms should not be “FULL AUTO”.\niii.    Only POF made .223 “NOT FULL AUTO” with 20 round magazine should be available to masses as a SPECIAL CATEGORY weapon.\niv.    This should only be licensed to retired or in service military or civilian servicemen and women, security agencies, engineers, doctors, teachers/professors, IT professionals, expatriates, scientists, agriculturists, highly qualified persons and tax-payers (with a certain minimum limit).\nl.     Awareness should be created regarding types and categories of firearms and cartridges. It is to be noted that even those who make policy or implement it are not well aware of various types and uses of firearms and their bullets.\nm.    Firearm traders and shopkeepers should be scrutinized and a software application should be made in which they record all purchases/sales and corresponding information promptly in real time (like NADRA system upload).\nn.    All FULL AUTO weapons should be made prohibited (No license should be issued to ANYONE in any category). Firearm used by our military/security forces including AK-47 (Kalashnikov), HK G3 and MP5 (full auto) should be banned for possession of civilians. As well as anti-material, anti bullet proof (armour piercing) or incendiary bullets be made non accessible and prohibited for civilian use.\no.    A guidebook of firearms, their safety precautions, governing laws and rules, exam sample and contacts should be published and made mandatory for every firearm holder. \np.    Manual of firearm should be produced by applicant as mandatory and scanned and recorded by department/concerned office.\nq.    Change/modification of weapons/firearms to FULL AUTO mode by any means should be completely prohibited.\nSome quick facts in this regard are also of interest;\n1.    7mm and 7.62 are different calibers and even 7.62 comprises various calibers (like 7.62x39 i.e. Kalashnikov, 7.62x51 (military G3 or civil 308, 7.62x54 is popular hunting cartridge).\n2.    308 is civilian version of 7.62x51 military cartridge used in G3.\n3.    POF is making very good quality and product range of civilian use/sporting firearms, even it exports to USA and western countries. We should benefit from POF by allowing sales to our own country/civilians.\n4.    Pakguns.com is an excellent enthusiast community with highly experienced and regarded moderators/senior members of military, hunting and shooting sports origin. It has thousands members and increasing.\n5.    Some glock pistols and imported 222/223 rifles can be modified to full auto and thereby falling in prohibited category. POF has made it impossible for their guns to be reverted to FULL AUTO.\n6.    Sportsmen earn fame and repute for the country and its citizens. They should be allowed to import (through Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Commerce) firearm (say 5 in a lifetime) of their choice from abroad without tax and duties through quick mechanism, no bribery and hurdles.\n7.    Firearm suppressors (commonly called silencers) should be explicitly banned for any firearm except .22 caliber. This .22 caliber is used for sporting and at ranges and suppressors keep these quiet.[/QUOTE]\n\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]Brother Survivalist[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000]I disagree only on one thing as you said PB licenses should be banned totally.

Otherwise semi auto mode is used only as it conserves ammo and a soldier can only carry a limited amount of ammo, additionally the full auto mode is not accurate. However I would support the notion that semi auto rifles should be allowed for civilian possession and should stay NPB. Firing a weapon on full auto mode only has a psychological effect on the enemy.', ''),

MashAllah. \nThe not-so-goo-looking .30 pistol is quite rightly not-at-all-so-good-looking. lol. and what is that rocket like thingy on the slide at the back? Is it some latest design of a rear sight which the rest of the world totally missed out? \n\nThe Metasco Stall seems to have good stuff, worth visiting. \n\nWhose stall is it, the one with leather goods? \n\nA slight correction here; the double barrel shotty which Nazim Sahab is fiddling around with is not a Coach Gun, rather its the usual DSA Double Barrel.[/QUOTE]\n\nThanks Jibz bhai, The rocket type thingy is the rear sight :der:. I guess they figured that it would attract the customers. The leather goods are being displayed by a certain "Moon Craft" company. \n\nThanks for the correction on the DSA double barrel in Nazim Sahab''s hand. Yes that is a DSA Royal and not usual at all, costs PKR 550,000/- . \n\nOh yeah do you recognise the person inspecting the gloves at Metasco stall?', ''),

(650955, ' We have learned in the US, that once you define an acceptable limit, that limit will be changed, and not to your benefit.  Our federal magazine limit of 10 rounds only lasted ten years, but several states copied it with 10/15 round limits. New York is at 7 rounds, and there are constant pushes for 5 rounds to be the limit.  Those arguing refer to "High capacity clips." (They mean magazines.)  But 30 rounds is the standard capacity for AK and AR style rifles and has been for decades.\n\nOur constitution not only enumerates a right to keep and bear arms, there is a provision for Congress to issue Letters of Marque and Reprisal. That means, when it was drafted, that privately owned warships with cannon were common enough to be of interest.\n\nThey have banned us from having private cannon (used through the Revolution, War of 1812 and Civil War) with licensing fees on both the gun and every round of ammo. They have banned other support weapons. They have banned full auto.  They are now trying, despite the Supreme Court endorsing our right, to ban semi-auto, and to reduce our magazines to nothing.\n\nOnce you let someone else define your limits, they can be redefined, infinitum.\n\nFirearms are not about "need."  People who don''t use them can always tell you, with no knowledge of the subject, what they think you "need."  Defense of oneself, one''s family, one''s community and one''s nation is a RIGHT given by God.\n\nAs another put it:\n\n[h=2]FRIDAY, JANUARY 25, 2013[/h][COLOR=#29303B][FONT=Georgia][h=3]A repost[/h]\n\n[COLOR=#000099][B][I]"We cannot negotiate with those who say, ''What''s mine is mine, and what''s yours is negotiable.''"\n\n-- John F. Kennedy, Address to the American People, 25 JUL 1961\n\nMost people tend to substitute the word ''compromise'' for the first ''negotiate'' in that quote, and it does tend to fit the current circumstances.\n\nOnce again the anti-gun people are starting to trot out the tired and hackneyed meme of "compromise" in the "national gun conversation".\n\nOne of the more highly linked of my posts is the one about the "Gun Rights Cake" analogy, which I will now re-post and expand a bit:\n\nI hear a lot about "compromise" from the gun-control camp ... except, it''s not compromise.\n\nAllow me to illustrate:\n\nLet''s say I have this cake. It is a very nice cake, with "GUN RIGHTS" written across the top in lovely floral icing. Along you come and say, "Give me that cake."\n\nI say, "No, it''s my cake."\n\nYou say, "Let''s compromise. Give me half." I respond by asking what I get out of this compromise, and you reply that I get to keep half of my cake.\n\nOkay, we compromise. Let us call this compromise The National Firearms Act of 1934.\n\nThis leaves me with half of my cake and there I am, enjoying my cake when you walk back up and say, "Give me that cake."\n\nI say -- again: "No, it''s my cake."\n\nYou say, "Let''s compromise." What do I get out of this compromise? Why, I get to keep half of what''s left of the cake I already own.\n\nSo, we compromise -- let us call this one the Gun Control Act of 1968 -- and this time I''m left holding what is now just a quarter of my cake.\n\nAnd I''m sitting in the corner with my quarter piece of cake, and here you come again. You want my cake. Again.\n\nThis time you take several bites -- we''ll call this compromise the Clinton Executive Orders -- and I''m left with about a tenth of what has always been MY DAMN CAKE and you''ve got nine-tenths of it. [/I][/B][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000099][B][/B][/COLOR][COLOR=#000099][B][I] Let me restate that: I started out with MY CAKE and you have already ''compromised'' me out of ninety percent of MY CAKE ...\n\n... and here you come again. Compromise! ... Lautenberg Act (nibble, nibble). Compromise! ... The HUD/Smith and Wesson agreement (nibble, nibble). Compromise! ... The Brady Law (NOM NOM NOM). Compromise! ... The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act (sweet tap-dancing Freyja, my finger!)\n\nAfter every one of these "compromises" -- in which I lose rights and you lose NOTHING -- I''m left holding crumbs of what was once a large and satisfying cake, and you''re standing there with most of MY CAKE, making anime eyes and whining about being "reasonable", and wondering "why we won''t compromise" as you try for the rest of my cake.\n\nIn 1933 I -- or any other American -- could buy a fully-automatic Thompson sub-machine gun, a 20mm anti-tank gun, or shorten the barrel of any gun I owned to any length I thought fit, silence any gun I owned, and a host of other things.\n\nCome your "compromise" in 1934, and suddenly I can''t buy a sub-machine gun, a silencer, or a Short-Barreled Firearm without .Gov permission and paying a hefty tax. What the hell did y''all lose in this "compromise"?\n\nIn 1967 I, or any other American, could buy or sell firearms anywhere we felt like it, in any State we felt like, with no restrictions. We "compromised" in 1968, and suddenly I''ve got to have a Federal Firearms License to have a business involving firearms, and there''s whole bunch of rules limiting what, where and how I buy or sell guns.\n\nIn 1968, "sporting purpose" -- a term found NOT ANY DAMNED WHERE IN THE CONSTITUTION, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT -- suddenly became a legal reason to prevent the importation of guns that had been freely imported in 1967.\n\nTell me, do -- exactly what the hell did you lose in this 1968 "compromise"?\n\nThe Lautenberg Act was a "compromise" which suddenly deprived Americans of a Constitutional Right for being accused or convicted of a misdemeanor -- a bloody MISDEMEANOR! What did your side lose in this "compromise"?\n\nI could go on and on, but the plain and simple truth of the matter is that a genuine "compromise" means that both sides give up something. My side of the discussion has been giving, giving, and giving yet more -- and your side has been taking, taking, and now wants to take more.\n\nFor you, "compromise" means you''ll take half of my cake now, and the other half of my cake next time.

This will make the gun more hold sensitive, and accuracy will suffer. \n\nPCP is another story, but you need all kinds of support equipment, like pumps and their replacement parts. You will also need good pellets and a chrony to see what kind of power your gun is generating so that you may calibrate it according to your needs. The walther is just an ok pcp and if you want it, it''ll depend on the price it is being offered to you. In most cases, a .22lr rifle will be a better option.... but keep in mind that one hole accuracy at the said distances is not even possible with that unless you find match grade ammo for it and shoot thousands and thousands round with it. \n\n@AK-Khan, hope you''re well. First, welcome to the forum. :) \n\nCan you please share which hawke and BSA scopes you are using? and also share the method with which you have calibrated your guns?

(651051, ' The PX4 Storm pistol is the latest addition to Beretta''s line of semiautomatic pistols. The PX4 is designed using most modern concepts in combat handguns, such as maximum flexibility, most modern polymer materials, and most popular calibers. Available in the USA since late 2004, this pistol is an obvious attempt of the famous Italian company to regain its position on the US market. We yet shall see, if this attempt will succeed.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the PX4 pistol is a further development of the Beretta 8000 Cougar series pistols. PX4 pistol uses same recoil operated, locked breech system with rotating barrel. Much like the Cougar, the PX4 has a special frame insert with top- projecting stud, which causes the barrel to rotate on recoil to unlock from the slide. This insert is mounted on the recoil spring guide rod, and is spring-buffered to reduce peak recoil, which is transferred from barrel to frame. The frame is made from high strength polymer, with dual disassembly buttons, located on both sides of the frame, ahead of the trigger guard. To remove the slide and barrel, one must unload the pistol, then push both buttons inward and then pull the slide forward and off the frame. The slide stop levers are situated on both sides of the frame and are ergonomically shaped. Modular trigger system of PX4 Storm pistol is available in four basic models: Type F - conventional double action with manual safety/decocker; Type D - double action only, less safety or decocker, with spurless hammer; Type G - conventional double action with manual decocker and no safety; and Type C - with so called "constant action" and spurless hammer (sort of DAO system with less trigger pull weight). In the F and D modifications, safety / decocker levers are located on both sides of the slide. The grip of the PX4 has removable backstraps; each gun is supplied with three backstraps of different sizes, so the actual grip can be adapted to most shooters. The frame also features a standard Picatinny-type accessory rail as a standard. Magazine capacity is 17 rounds of 9mm ammo or 14 rounds of .40SW ammo. With optional extended capacity magazine baseplates (also available from Beretta), capacity is increased to impressive 20 rounds of 9mm or 17 rounds of .40SW.', ''),
(651052, ' The K100 pistol has been in development since 1996, when the first patent was received for its improved rotary-barrel action. The first prototype, designated K1, was built in 1998 and series production commenced in 2003, under the new designation of K100. The most recent versions of the K100 family are K100 Mk.6 (full-size pistol with Picatinny-type accessory rail on the frame below the barrel) and k100 P1 (a semi-compact "police" pistol with shortened barrel).\r\n\r\nThe K100 is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistol with a polymer frame. It uses the relatively rare rotating barrel locking system, with a somewhat unique implementation. Instead of the typical "lug and cam slot" arrangement, which is usually responsible for barrel rotation upon recoil, the K100 has a cross-pin set into the frame and a helix-shaped flat cut made at the bottom of the chamber area of the barrel. Upon recoil, this helix cut slides over the cross-pin, forcing the barrel to rotate which unlocks it from the slide. Another unusual feature (at least for a locked-breech pistol) is the method of disassembly, which includes a pivoting trigger-guard which acts as a disassembly release. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and an ambidextrous, frame mounted manual safety. Since 2005, new models have also been available with alternative triggers: DAO (no manual safety) and QA (Quick-action, with pre-cocked main spring). On standard pistols, both slide release and manual safety levers are duplicated at either side of the frame, providing completely ambidextrous operations. An automated firing pin safety block is also provided. Magazines are double-stack, with the magazine release button located at the base of the trigger-guard. Sights are either of fixed or adjustable type; the front sight is pinned to the slide, the rear sight is dovetailed. \r\n For special purposes, the K100 can be fitted with an extended, threaded barrel and a silencer (sound moderator) of indigenous design. To ensure reliable functioning with a heavy silencer attached to the barrel, it has a built-in "recoil booster" module, which helps to cycle the heavier barrel/silencer unit. Other specialized versions are the K-102R and K-105R, which have fire mode selectors and can fire in single shots and in two-round (K-102) or variable length (K-105) bursts.', ''),

(651109, 'CZ-52 acquired A few months ago a friend was telling me all about a pistol called the CZ-52, made during the 1950s in Czechoslovakia.  I had seen a bunch of old CZ pistols and was unimpressed; mostly small blowback designs.\n\nThe 52 (CZ made a bunch of pistol designs, apparently all ending in [something]2, which confuses things...) is a locked breech, short recoil design in 7.62 Tokarev, the same cartridge the TT uses.  It''s about the same size as the TT or a 1911, but much sleeker than either.  For a military weapon it''s downright pretty.\n\nThe 52 is truly roller *locked*, not roller-delayed blowback like the CETME or H&K designs.  The rollers keep the breech locked closed until the upper slides back far enough for them to drop into slots in the frame, which lets the upper continue without the barrel.  The barrel does not tilt like a TT; it just slides.\n\nI was persuaded that a CZ-52 might be a nice thing to have, so I decided to buy one.\n\nIt took several months for me to find one, and I wound up paying more than I really wanted, but once I had it in my hand I felt it was money well spent.  Hopefully it shoots as well as it looks and feels.\n\nOn the downside, my wife said "it''s so pretty!" and "it''s my birthday present!"  Pointing out that her birthday is in March has been ineffective.  So I may have to save my money and buy another...\n\nI haven''t taken any pictures of it yet, but they were all the same; mine has some slight wear from being carried.  \n\nHere are some articles on the CZ-52:\n\nWikipedia: https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCZ_52\nBox of Truth: http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theboxotruth.com%2Feducational-zone-25-great-firearms-the-cz-52%2F\nForgotten Weapons: http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forgottenweapons.com%2Fczech-cz-52-pistol-video%2F\n\n(picture from Box of Truth)', '');

The CQ Type A carbine variant is claimed to be able to stabilize both M193 "Ball" and SS109/M885 variants of the 5.56mm cartridge, as would be expected from a rifle with a 1:9 barrel rifling twist.

In mean time there will be lot of space for compressed air to escape, and then your gun will start loosing its accuracy, power and velocity.\nIn new guns It can happen as manufacturers oil them to decrease friction and avoid rusting of parts and many buyers leave it as it is. but i will vote against it. If you know how to deassemble it then it is good otherwise take the service of some air rifle gun smith to do it for you. Personaly i have only experianced shadow 1k till now so i am not in position to guide you about this Diana rifle. Make sure what ever grease is applied lately it should be thick tar grease like "Moly grease". regular grease is not good for air rifles because it ignites even with moly grease very thin film should be applied to moving parts "piston chamber and seal should not be greased at all" but piston itself , spring and guide rod has no issue these should be greased just avoid heavy greasing.', ''),

In mean time there will be lot of space for compressed air to escape, and then your gun will start loosing its accuracy, power and velocity.\nIn new guns It can happen as manufacturers oil them to decrease friction and avoid rusting of parts and many buyers leave it as it is. but i will vote against it. If you know how to deassemble it then it is good otherwise take the service of some air rifle gun smith to do it for you. Personaly i have only experianced shadow 1k till now so i am not in position to guide you about this Diana rifle. Make sure what ever grease is applied lately it should be thick tar grease like "Moly grease". regular grease is not good for air rifles because it ignites even with moly grease very thin film should be applied to moving parts "piston chamber and seal should not be greased at all" but piston itself , spring and guide rod has no issue these should be greased just avoid heavy greasing.[/QUOTE]\n\nthx bro appreciate\ni lison one more thing some body says to me in 35 model have some chinese copies?', ''),

(651273, ' Salam,\n\n@D3AD bro, Diana outsourced barrel production some time ago. Although there is no confirm answer as to where, but it was outsourced. The barrels produced by them were barrels with 12 lands and grooves. They were used in model 34, 31 and 350. This created a stir all around the globe among Diana fans. The production was then taken back by Diana and now 8 land barrels made by Diana themselves. This further created an uproar among the people who had bought the guns with 12 land barrels, till finally the Diana Company issued a statement; that the production was not re taken because of some fault in the 12 land barrel, but due to the simple fact that the percentage of reject barrels from the QC dept increased. The statement further assured all the buyers that the 12 land barrels that left the factory in the assembled packaged guns were still backed with the same guarantee.\nOn ground, it has been noted that the guns with 12 land barrels were more pellet fussy than the 8 land barrel guns but were about 20-30 fps faster in the 14 grain range of pellets. \n\nThe scope that you mention is the same I have on my 34, but when I installed it on the 52, the illumination knob was almost falling out in abt 25-30 shots. So I don''t think it''ll hold.\n\n@aburehan, chinese have cloned the 34 but with the t05 trigger, not the ones with the t06 trigger. I think it is not hard to tell a chinese gun from a german one by judging its finish. Also, dont be put off by this but Diana no longer has a model 35 or 36 on their website. Even I found this very fishy, but then I looked at a 35 at a dealer''s, and it was definitely not chinese :) . Later I found out that since the 35 and 36 were best sellers in their time, Diana still brands some 34s as 35 and 36 for the Arab market.\n\nPlease note, you need a lot of patience to learn how to shoot. Just buying a pcp will not magically teach you how to shoot. This holds true for long range shooting much more. You see once the pellet leaves the barrel, it is at the mercy of gravity and wind, so many factors. You have to give yourself some time with the gun, and the gun also needs some time to break in(just like you do running of a new car). An airgun is actually harder to shoot than a proper rifle. You need to learn the artillery hold and practice, practice, practice. :)\n\nRegards.', ''),

(651340, ' Let me give you a proper analysis:\n\nKilinc 2000:\n- More robustly made as compared to S120\n- Currently in use by Turkish Army\n- Kilinc 2000 is a clone of the Tangfolio tz75 as it was made by collaboration of Tangfolio (Italy) and Sarsilmaz specifically to fullfill the needs of their army\n- The Kilinc 2000 does not accept CZ grips as there is a difference in grip angle of Tangfolio TZ75 and CZ75\n- The Kilinc accepts the new generation of CZ75 magazines (with notches on both sides). The old CZ75 magazines will also fit in with a little bit of modification\n- In Kilinc you dont need to worry about fitting in CZ75 magazines because Sarsilmaz magazines are easily available in market for 5000 to 6000 rupees\n- Sarsilmaz was not very successful with POF because of the specific models they chose. Like every gun manufacturer, Sarsilmaz has some lemon models as well and ST9 happens to be one of those so do not judge Sarsilmaz by the performance of ST9\n- Sarsilmaz has a more advanced manufacturing facility as compared to Canikk... Reason being, Sarsilmaz is a state owned organisation, much like POF for Pakisan\n- The dots on sight of Kilinc 2000 are big and obvious, exactly like the CZ75 Special Edition. Helps in quick acquisition and also works great for precision shooting\n- The gun is made from Forging and not casting, but so is S120\n\n\n\nS120:\n- This gun definitely has better bluing as compared to the Kilinc 2000\n- Accepts CZ75 magazines and Grips\n- Canikk Spare magazines are not available in market\n- The gun is made from Forging and not casting, just like Kilinc 2000\n- The Stock Grips that come on S120 are better looking as compared to those that come with Kilinc\n- The sights on this gun are very fine and small dots. Good for precision shooting\n- This gun is a direct clone of the CZ75 and not a Tangfolio Clone like the Kilinc 2000\n\nBoth guns have Barrel life of 30,000 plus rounds and both are excellent guns. Go for either, which ever feels better in your hands. \n\nBUT, most importantly, bro which city are you from and are these guns even available in market? As per my information (which can be wrong) there is no Kilinc 2000 or Canikk S120 in the Karachi Market atleast (but I can be wrong, just commenting as per my sources go)', ''),

Nicknamed  the Pogojet, it is a radical less-than-lethal design from a senior  research scientist, Jeffrey Widder,  from [URL="http://www.battelle.org/"]Battelle Memorial Institute[/URL] in Ohio.\n\n The Pogojet — whose official title is the Caseless Telescoping  Less-lethal System — is unique in that the propellant burns inside the  round, pushing on a piston that propels it ahead. The motion resembles a  pogo stick, therefore the name. As soon as the piston reaches its full  extent, the exhaust gases could be vented sideways, so the round  continues ahead at the same pace, or directed via holes in the base of  the round like a rocket exhaust to provide as much extra boost as  required. That is the ‘jet’ aspect of the Pogojet, which Widder compares  to the old 1960s[URL="http://world.guns.ru/handguns/hg/usa/gyrojet-e.html"] Gyrojet rocket pistol[/URL].\n\n\n [B]Smart Bullets[/B]\n\n [URL="http://gadgtecs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pogojet-2.jpg"][IMG]http://gadgtecs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pogojet-2-255x300.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n[I]The .50 caliber Pogojet’s base [/I]\n\nIt is an intelligent design meant to get around an annoying problem.  Conventional wisdom says that the non-deadly rounds used to stun  suspects have to be big, soft, and sluggish. Consider the bean bag  rounds fired from police shotguns, the 40mm sponge grenades utilized by  the military, and conventional “rubber bullets.” Their low speed gives  them a much shorter range than a rock which is thrown by a strong hand—a  critical drawback when dealing with rioters.\n\n The other problem with less-lethal impact weapons is balancing  effectiveness with safety. A round that travels slowly enough to be safe  at point-blank range will be ineffective at greater distance. Enhance  the muzzle velocity to knock down a threat further away and the weapon  turns into a potentially lethal one when used from a closer range.\n\n\n\nSource: [URL="http://gadgtecs.com/2016/01/12/pogojet-a-new-compact-lightweight-weapon-will-stop-a-target-in-their-tracks-from-a-hundred-meters-away-without-harming-them/"]PogoJet[/URL]', ''),

(651902, 'Few Facts about CZ 75 P-01 The CZ 75 P-01, differs markedly in a number of ways from the original, yet should be equally appealing to American shooters. The CZ 75 P-01 is a short recoil-operated, aluminium alloy-framed, double-action (DA) pistol equipped with a decocker.  It was created at the behest of the Czech national police, which presented CZ with a daunting protocol for the pistol''s performance. The test included such requirements as firing without failure following 4,000 dry firings and 3,000 decoking’s. Moreover, it had to endure 1,350 field stripping and 150 detail stripping. Further, to demonstrate the interchange ability of parts, any number of P-01 pistols could be randomly selected, disassembled, their parts mixed and the guns reassembled with no failures permitted. Safety was evinced by the guns being dropped from a variety of angles onto concrete from a height of 1.5 meters (54 times) and 3 meters (five times) with no failures (a failure being a discharge). The guns were then required to fire without being serviced. The necessary durability was proven by having the pistols fire after being frozen for 24 hours at 32 degrees F, and again after being heated for 24 hours at 126 degrees F. The guns also had to tolerate immersion in mud, sand and combinations thereof even after being stripped of oil. Finally, the pistols had to have a service life of 15,000 rounds.', ''),

Now when a minimum viable product (MVP) will be developed, it could be customized for any gun in the world but with certain limitations.

Also it requires customization f firearm (with tooling and machinery for installation of actuators). \r\n\r\nOnce any firearm is equipped with our safety device, it will help user to ensure unintentional or unauthorized firearm security and safety (locking) in several use cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, in a shooting range where firearms are kept and issued by range master, certain parameters will be pre-defined and programmed in a firearm by main control application (master software). These parameters will include location/position, direction, time-lease, start and end time and date, number of shots allowance, logging of every action and incident etc. A firearm will be leased to a user. He/she will bring to certain location (firing stand) and magazine insertion/loading part will be unlocked at certain time [date] of lease. User will load the firearm but will be unable to cock/bolt [depending upon nature of firearm] before go ahead. Than user will rack slide and load firearm and again wait for certain duration [possibly say 30 sec], gain posture and direct firearm in direction of target. Now, firearm will only get unlocked when it will point towards direction of target [with enough secure spread margin]. So user will fire all [or allowed] shots, and if user meanwhile direct the firearm any direction other than target or retreats from allowed location or time lease is ended, firearm will again get locked!', ''),

(652311, ' Dear Ajmal bro, there is nothing in EM that could guarantee 100% most of times, you know. Simpler a mechanism and lesser parts usually have better failsafe life. So what we did is at rest position (no current passing, no commands), firearm will be locked, no discharge possible unless tempered. All local communication is encrypted among controller and actuators [these have command and power lines]. Now there are 2 possible scenarios,  one is hacking/tempering with communication lines [wired or wireless] to alternate lease/location/direction information and thereby render firearm unsafe/unlocked, it is possible for experts but not easier. Other is possibility of a bug/error in firmware of microcontroller that unlocks firearm, it is less likely as real time systems are not so complex and millions lines of code to debug, and mostly these work as coded. Even industrial machinery, robots and high speed automated trains are controlled by similar technology. Now last part is accuracy of sensors such as GPS, IPS, IMU which is quite possible but has certain tolerances and threshold levels. Say you are in booth and directs firearm towards target and it is unlocked 5-10 degrees before or after allowed spread [say 30''], no issues. But what if IPS fails and positioning in certain location is incorrect, quite possible and dangerous. It happens because of interferences due to presence of walls, pillars, furniture, electronics and human bodies in indoors. What is usually done is 1. to track from point of origin to detect any possible misalignment/error 2. some algorithm that does sensor fusion and use IMU for cross checking with IPS as well as a certain level of tolerance but if there is a jump or dive in readings (changes other than linear/smooth) it will try to auto-correct and realign. You might experience similar when you get indoors/basement while driving vehicle using gps/navi without wifi and it lost signals. Lastly we have incorporated 2.4G spectrum ambient wireless positioning in it as well.\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at Decawave [an implementation/vendor] for further reading for IPS technologies if interested [[url]http://www.decawave.com/][/url].', ''),

ES of 18\n\nBut...... the most mind boggling of all:\n\nIt averaged 670 with H&N FTT with an ES of 32.\n\nHonestly, I was shocked. I then thought maybe it was because of the 5.53 head size, and a pretty tight fit in the barrel. I then tried some Crosman Ultra Mags(since they are tightest fit in the barrel), but got the following results.\n\nAveraged 712fps with the Crosman Ultra magnums. Extreme spread of 12, so pretty tight.\n\nSo, I did some research. I found out the following\n\n1. The advertised weight of the FTT is not correct. Reported weights vary from 14.80 grains to 15.60 grains.\n2. Earlier FTT tins were usually over 15.5 grains\n\nOk, so maybe I got an old tin.

But, all things are not equal. Polymer frames flex, where steel is rigid. The inherent shock absorbing nature of a polymer gun therefore mitigates a lot of perceived recoil. Whether a heavy gun is more accurate largely depends on the shooter. Some people (myself included) shoot better with a lighter gun, whereas others require more weight to keep their hands steady.', ''),

The parents will start shouts of " This is putting our kids in danger " \nand " Why do we have a army if our kids are the ones being trained " \n\nAsk the kids to take some responsibility for their own safety, and they will start complaining, along with their parents. \n\nAsk the females to train and the mummy-daddy kids, and they will start calls of " why do we have to do this  " . \nThose that are willing to undergo training, over 3/4ths will drop out intentionally after complaining that this is too hard, or spouting up with ridiculous ideas about how combat actually happens, all instilled there by bollywood/hollywood action scenes. \nIf they do manage to get through training( the females and the mummy-daddy types ), it will only be after a extremely diluted version of training is made up and formulated just for them ( sounds like nestle nido ) where they have to put in minimum effort, learn nothing and then they get a meaningless certificate that they wave around. \n\nNot to mention the shouts for modesty by the religious types when the females are asked to do their part. \n\nAnd there will be a good portion of the " i do not like or approve of guns pacifist squad"  , thinking that not participating is a guaranteed way to keep themselves save. \n\nFurthermore even if the training is done, it will be kept out of the elite and high end schools as much as possible, because their liberal ( read : useless )  mindset will not allow it. \n\n\nThe QRS is a more practical idea, but pakistan being pakistan, this wont happen. \n\nThe best you can do is go to a school with beefed up security and teach your own kids to be situationally aware at all times, and get them a very small EDC knife or something ( not that it will help much at all, but its better then nothing)', ''),

Was a bit surprised as I couldn''t even remember opening this thread until I saw it again just now, lol. But any way since I am here might as well give a quick update. \nI returned back from Pak a few weeks ago, was there through out December til 2nd week of Jan, had a good time as expected, attended the Toss show on its last day, went on a few so called hunting/ picnic trips mostly to the river Indus and Unboxed the Hatsan Esc Combo after it had been left NIB on top of the shelf for last 3 years, tested it and it always missed the first round. It only fired the first round when the single fire mode button was pressed, otherwise it always missed first round so I had eject the first round out, and then for some reason it would start firing from 2nd round n onwards. I wasn''t happy so rang a friend who is an Arms dealer he agreed to take it in Part ex (gave me a good price) I wanted to get the legendary MP 153 but as we all know they are out of stock, BUT here it gets a little bit interesting, he had one MP 155 and offered me that, I was hesitant after what I read about it on PG and from other friends etc but the dealer assured me that it is a 2013 production piece and everything is spot on with it now so I paid money on top and bought it. \n\nA couple of days later took it to river Indus area fired, first 5 rounds of Shaheen no 6 went smooth. Fired a few more, still good. After 10 rounds, loaded a few and here came the disappointment when it failed to throw out the Shaheen No#4. It was out of the barrel but stuck just inside the bolt/ loading point n I could see it.  Anyway it continued doing so and I had 2 or 3 more FTE''s with Shaheen no#4''s. I was going to mention this in the baikal MP 155 thread in response to the EHSAAN KHAN''s question asking if any one had purchased a MP 155 in 2015 but didn''t get a chance yet. I took it back to the dealer n got a refund and a couple of days later went straight to Peshawar where I knew some one who the last one or two 153 left and luckily I got my hands on one and bought one it''s a 2009 production in dark colour. In addition also bought a Turkish Kral Semi Auto just for the fun of it, Tested both guns including 153 the next day and Alhumdulillah no issues nothing whatsoever as expected.', ''),

And the annoyance of having to reset the position of your gun after every shot in order to re-load it. \n\nGoing back to a more sensible comparison, a crossbow is not a magical death machine.

They may be the same type of vehicle but the f150 is a significantly larger vehicle ( about a foot wider, 1.5-2 feet longer a foot taller )  and MUCH more capable  ( in terms of off roading they are about equal ) But the f150 can tow and carry about double whatever the hilux can ( 6200 pounds vs 12,200 pounds ) . Calling them equivalent is like calling a galaxy star pro equivalent to the note 5. They do the same things, but the note 5 is significantly better by a massive margin in every aspect. \n\nThe hilux is a compact pickup, and the f150 is a full size. That alone should tell you enough.\n\nThe vehicle that you can compare a f150 is a land cruiser, but not many hunters have that, owing to its non-local manufacture and the costs of importing a vehicle. \n\n\nIf you are looking for something logical and relevant, read the first few lines and the last few lines of my previous post; or any other post on this thread. \n\n\n\n\nAs for reloading time, a semi, bolt action, bow are all capable of follow up shots. ( 1-3 seconds till the next round is launched )  \n\nThis thing, unless you have a person standing right next to you holding a arrow, is not going to be capable of a  follow up shot anytime before 5-10 seconds after the inital shot.\n\nThis thing is not a bow, aside from the ammunition and barrel it is identical to a PCP, and should be held to the same standards as a PCP.

This is also a very big draw back that NO ONE cant test a FIRE ARM before purchasing even if it is used, can''t even imagine to test a new one. Bec. the firearm becomes USED if it is checked with no alternative. Only one has to rely on specs, info. provided by the dealer, its history or name or some googling.

We were great buddies. for the 9 or so years our friendship lasted, we did everything together; we played together, got into video games together, you name it. \n\nLife was great. His father was a high end govt official. One day, someone took offence at his father, and had a small political campaign against him to get him fired. Anyone familiar with the political scene in pakistan would know this to be true. This was not a particularly bad attack, as anyone in a authority position would know, everyone goes against you at some point in time in politics. \n\nThis guy, he was somewhat different. Still a useless pile of scum, but he had a larger backing then most. \nThe father of my friend, ignored this chap to the best of his ability. He would get tired and go away like all the rest in time, he thought. \n\nFast forward 6 months. While relaxing at home, he suddenly gets the police knocking on his door all of a sudden. He was confused, like anyone else in that scenario. What could he possibly have done wrong? \n\nA 3 months later, fast forward to the court hearing. He gets charged with money laundering. After a further 6 months of lawyers, trials, and red tape, he was cleared. Untill they brought up another charge against him. This was the type of violation that could be completely dropped or sentenced based on the judges jurisdiction. In other words, It was a common sense law that should have had him cleared instantly the second it was brought in front of a judge, but we sat there, me and my buddy as that judge took that charge ( Our lawyer explicitly told us that this charge was complete nonsense, and he had never seen anyone convicted for it. )   We were calm for the rest of the trial, untill the end. Instead of a complete release, lo and behold he gets hit with 5 years in prison. \n\nNow he sits rotting in prison and waiting on his appeal, his accusers go free and have occupied his office in government, and his sits and calls his family every week to update them on the snails-pace appeal going on, and how bad the roti/channay are in prison. \nThat family now has to live and eat on the goodwill of their relatives. A family that was once king of the world, now having to shelter behind others because of the insecurity of a fool and the greed of a judge. \n\nThe point, is what im saying is that although this was a completely common sense law, he was still thrown behind bars because the judge chose to interpret it in the most negative way possible.\n\nIn all common sense it SHOULD be legal to put a suppressor on your air rifle, but i have no wish to advocate anything that may get any member of PG thrown behind bars. \nThe reason why i keep on telling you about nonsense/ bribed judges and the strictest interpretation of this law, is because i have personally seen it happen. And why i am asking you to steer clear of any law that is open to the personal interpretation of the judge. \n\n\nYou will not find me ever warning you about keep a edc knife that is under 4.5 inches, because no matter what 4.5 inches will not get longer or shorter. Its a explicit number that is in the law, and no interpretation of a judge will be able to change that. \n\nI would not like to see what happened to my friends father happen to any one of you because " Common sense/interpretation makes it legal" . NO. Just no. Keep yourself safe above all else.\n\nIf you want to still complain about me being angry, of course ill be angry when a fool can avoid having his entire home destroyed by the interpretation of one judge; yet he does it anyway and puts himself in that position.  I have no desire to see a PG member or anyone thrown behind bars because the judge could interpret a law in a particular way. \n\n\nIm not willing to speak on this topic any further. If you wanted a debate, consider yourself the winner.', ''),

The only similarity between both guns is they are based on AK platform and chambered in 556 NATO.Magazine availability is a real issue as it may and shall go dry in future . The gun is solidly built and , in my opinion, shall not have any issue like firing pin breakage . The only issue it may and shall have , is the mag availability . So any one buying it should buy magazines in bulk too. I have looked this gun"s barrel and its twist rate seems to be the same as CQA.

So last year I felt in love with clay shooting while watching a contest on a trap stand. I never before shot a shotgun but I decided to buy me one 12 gauge O/U. The hardest thing was to find out which one and which brand is good for me, fits my body and fits my wallet. So I picked up everthing written on the internet and found this forum. I wondered heavily about such a huge sporting clay society in Pakistan and was very pleased many of you folks use a Baikal and just a few the Berettas and other fancy and costly guns like here in Germany.\nSo guess what came out for me!\nI purchased a brand new Baikal 27 with all the bells an whistles and produced in 7/2015, all for a cheaper price than a used shotgun from Italy or Turkey.\nI picked up every info about this Baikal and was very pleased from the knowledge provided here. I followed the tips and tricks and tweaked my new gun, did all necessarities and at the end I had a very nice and reliable functioning shotgun in my hands.\nSo I would like to thank you for those informations and I decided to open an account here in this forum to profit from your experience with these shotguns and if I am able so bring me in here.

I tweaked all the parts inside the gun as cutting springs and polishing each needed part of the lockwork and the extractors as well. I completed the rudimentory oil finished stock to a matte satin and nice grained stocks, rounded all metal and wooden edges a bit and made it handsome and good looking in comparision to much more expensive shotguns I''ve seen on several occasions.\nNot just once I heard a shout from other sporters or hunters like this: "Oh this is really a Baikal? Couldn''t believe this but I had one when I was young and shoot it many years."\nYou down there in Pakisten must know that very many of the hunters and even sporters define their own value by the guns they own. So accusing to their point of view a gun below 2500 Euros is a crap and a welknown brands name is much more worth than their shooting (and target hit) abilities. If a gun has grade A1 hazelnut wood stocks an rich engravings even with gold inlays should make others stun (I don''t know if this is a typical german or european behavior but the same is to many other things like cars f. ex. they drive).\nSo I can finally state that I love my Baikal.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

But this makes a reblueing neccessary and I don''t want this done by a cold blue. So how are the barrels and the rail attached together?

I completed the rudimentory oil finished stock to a matte satin and nice grained stocks, rounded all metal and wooden edges a bit and made it handsome and good looking in comparision to much more expensive shotguns I''ve seen on several occasions.\nNot just once I heard a shout from other sporters or hunters like this: "Oh this is really a Baikal? Couldn''t believe this but I had one when I was young and shoot it many years."\nYou down there in Pakisten must know that very many of the hunters and even sporters define their own value by the guns they own. So accusing to their point of view a gun below 2500 Euros is a crap and a welknown brands name is much more worth than their shooting (and target hit) abilities. If a gun has grade A1 hazelnut wood stocks an rich engravings even with gold inlays should make others stun (I don''t know if this is a typical german or european behavior but the same is to many other things like cars f. ex. they drive).\nSo I can finally state that I love my Baikal.\n\nBest regards\nMathi[/QUOTE]\n\nBro yes its true to some extent.\nsee there are two aspects. \n1) will you throw your beretta down in the mud or swamp to retrieve a bird or for any other reason. Most likely NO. will you use your beretta in rainy weather again most likely NO. But you will use the Baikal because first you know it won''t fail on you second even if it does you can always buy another ;).\n2) case is my case I pamper my  gun a lot because it was my first gun on my 18th birthday. \nbut I have shot it with people who were using beretta and Maroochi and all the guns performed exactly the same. infact I remember the person who was shooting the Marocchi swapped his gun with the baikal o/u which was kept as a backup gun. :)\n\nbesides my gun has turned most heads who were using expensive guns because the grain and wood on my gun is exceptional.', ''),

Germany has one of the striktest weapon laws in the world following the thesis: -As few as possible weapons to the people- and the lawmakers increase this year by year.\nIf you want to own a firearm you have to fulfill a lot of preconditions. If you meet them all successfully you are allowed to buy a (a shotgun in this case) gun, own it in your home, bring it to the shooting range or into your hunting ground. You are not allowed to posess it elsewhere. All this is combined with a lot of restrictions:\n1. you have to pay a lot of money for the certain permits, even to buy the needed ammo. Before all that you have to prove either the possession of a yearly hunting license (costly and time consuming to get by) or the minimum 1 year membership in a shooting club paired with successful participation with contests to prove your steadyness to target/bulleye shooting. Besides this all you have to prove a lot of knowledge in laws, self defense laws, gun handling, psycical wellness and some more.\nYou can imagine it is a stony way to own a gun!\nI''m not quite sure if I didn''t forget some requirements but this was mainly the key data and I hope to get you informed enough.\n\nBest regards\nMathi', ''),

Their people have learned the value of weapons. \n\nThe USA had their civil war\nThe philippines had japanese occupation\nThe czech republic had to hold out under communist rule in the eastern bloc\nThe swiss was sandwiched in between the axis and the allies\n\nGranted; these countries have significantly less lenient laws then the states, but one must also note that most developed countries that one would like to live or at least visit, these have the most lenient laws amongst all of them. \n\nI feel the reason that we dont care is that we never had anyone tell us that it is OUR responsibility to take care of ourselves in the midst of a threat to public safety ; or when there was a threat long ago we were not reminded of it every waking moment like the Americans and their civil war. \n\n\n\nIn other news, i saw a security guard while driving along the motorway, he had a RPK, with the bipod and drum magazine and everything.', ''),

They dont know what grease to use. They dont know the function of Moly Grease and silicon oil and their respective use.  Still if you need free help, I can do it for you.  \r\n\r\nThere were two version of Diana 45 model.  Earlier model is with Leather Piston seal and later model is with Synthetic piston seal.\r\n\r\nI know how to replace the seal and how to replace the spring.  You may need to replace the breach seal as well.  Bent barrel is no problem.  Its just the matter of half an hour of work.\r\n\r\nIf one does all that work with complete care, your gun can become amazing. Good power.\r\n\r\nYou need to arrange parts. The only part I have is original 45 ,model spring which I can give you. For piston seal and breach seal you need effort.  \r\n\r\nYou may need to correct your sights or put a good scope.\r\n\r\nThis is what I may be able to do for you. But if your trigger is damaged or any other part is damaged, that will need replacement.  Never go for repair / welding.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy your gun.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nUmair bhai can u help me...\r\nJust bought 350 magnum but with T05 trigger...

The wait has been too long honestly...[/QUOTE]\n\nMy friend, It is useless to get frustrated on something over which we don''t have any controls. This is just wasting your good energy. \n\nI will answer your queries one by one.\n\n1. To get a license , you DO NOT have to be that well connected. If licenses are open, an ordinary person like me can get a license. However if closed for general public, then it is difficult. But let me tell you one thing, if a facility/service/product is announced closed for general public then getting it via some other MEANS is also not ethical. You being a law-abiding citizen, should understand what I mean. \n2. MOI licenses are closed for last couple of years now. If you want to be treated out of general public category, then you have to go high in connection. I.e. some senior minister, ch nisaar himself, CM, PM , president etc etc. \n3. Easiest option for you would be ICT license issued by Islamabad administration. Though there is no ban on them but unfortunately they are also temporarily closed. However if you know DC, commissioner personally, then your problem can be solved. I heard they are opening licenses in March. \n4. If you are real desperate and want to get one ASAp then the option proposed by Khanjee666 is workable. Get you temporary address updated on your CNIC and get yourself one. But again licenses are closed there too. However same thing can be done for baluchistan. \n\nIf you allow I will advise you to wait for couple of months. Inshallah things will get better.', ''),

If its for hunting, I prefer double barrels, because you just get 2 shots, hence keeping the sport fair and you get an advantage that no semi auto can ever give you..... two barrels with two different chokes :) If its for HD/SD nothing beats the simplicity of a pump.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(653732, ' Speed\r\n\r\nThe modernisation of all the principal parts of the weapon, i.e. the slide and the frame, together with the extended barrel, enables repeating single shots more rapidly and more dynamically. The shape of the frame facilitates a more comfortable higher grip towards the axis of the barrel, while the new checkering ensures an absolutely reliable contact with the weapon in any circumstances. The increased weight of the front part of the frame and the slide results in a higher level of compensation and a gentler recoil. The innovative trigger mechanism has a smooth action, a low resistance and a shortened trigger reset. The magazine catch is more easily accessible and is adjustable to three positions, which makes reloading safer and quicker even if the shooter is moving.\r\n\r\nAccuracy\r\n\r\nThe extending of the barrel to 125 mm together with the new and longer height-adjustable sights also increases the overall accuracy of this weapon. The extremely precise and the fully automated technology for the production of the other major parts by utilising robotic machining centres without this involving any manual labour additionally contributes to the high quality of the weapon’s crafting. The Arcor finish that was inspired by the design of the service models ensures the weapon’s high resistance to corrosion, weathering or mechanical damage.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.czub.cz/en/produkty/pistole/competition/cz-shadow-2.html[/url]', ''),

I merely used it though in a non dusty environment it''s a great upland hunting gun, very fast,lightweight and less recoil.\nIf you are interested in 400 xplor then surely get it as it''s one of the best out there.\nBut you should be able to field strip and clean it thoroughly and have the plug removed by the seller so you can add at least one more shell  in mag. as at first it might be 3 or 3+1.\n\nGood luck!', ''),

(653859, ' The Mosin-Nagant rifle was a repeating version of the "Berdanka" single-shot rifle.  Russia had adopted a large bore single shot rifle designed by Hiram Berdan, a former Union Army officer from the American Civil War.  Berdan sold the Russians a first design, then an improved design, now known as the Berdan #1 and Berdan #2.\n\nLater, the Russian military wanted a modern small-bore repeating rifle.  Rather than designing a whole new rifle they modified the Berdan #2 to take a new high-velocity .30 caliber cartridge and gave it a sophisticated box magazine with an anti-tilt follower and an "interrupter" mechanism to prevent double-feeding.  The new Model 1891 rifle was made on existing Berdan tooling with little or no modification.\n\nDuring WWI the Russians were so short of rifles that they updated old single-shot Berdan rifles by screwing on .30-caliber barrels and inletting Mosin magazine assemblies.\n\n\nOh, Hiram Berdan - he''s also the guy who invented the priming system used by most of the world *except* his home country; the Berdan primer, which is a simple cup with priming compound.  Imported Berdan primers are nearly unobtainable in the USA, where ammunition makers have universally standardized on the somewhat more complicated separate-anvil system invented by the British Colonel Boxer.', ''),
