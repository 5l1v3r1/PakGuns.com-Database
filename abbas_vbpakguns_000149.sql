I have dropped it misused it thrown at it as much abuse as a 16 year old can throw to his first and only weapon.

To cut it short I completely agree with what is written by @Armughan, so much so that as if he stole words of my mouth. CZ Duty was never on the list of weapons I wanted to buy for my first ever gun. But after drilling down to the choices that I made i.e. Taurus 809, Cougar and Sarsilmaz, I just couldn''t find the perfect combination of finish, reliability, accuracy, fire power, weight and value for money until I came across the CZ duty. The moment I held it the first time in my hand I simply feel in love with it, like the lovers love at first sight :) I finally bought it the very next day without wasting any time. And with out wasting any further time I present you...\n.\n.\n.\n.\nDrums rolling :drum::drum::drum:\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nTook it to the range along with my friend''s CZ SP-01 Shadow, fired some 80 + rounds S&B 115grains through the duty and 120 rounds through Shadow.\n\nNot a single FTF or FTE in both the weapons. As far as the Shadow is concerned it is a class of its own, its Cadillac of hand guns, If shouting at the range is your only desire and you have over 100 grands to spend then look no other but CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow.\n\nVerdict: For a hammer fired gun you want to carry and defend your life with, nothing beats the CZ duty.

(434030, ' @Hunting-mania bro, barrel droop is a common issue witnessed mostly in break barrel air rifles (the fixed barrel rifles have less significant barrel droop), and you notice it when you mount a scope on it. If you''re used to of shooting with open sights then you won''t even notice if your airgun faces this issue; why? because your open sights are mounted on your barrel hence they are in line with the direction your barrel is pointing at. But you mount your scope on the receiver and the scope''s line of sight needs to be adjusted accordingly. The slightest inconsistency between the barrel and receiver (at the breech where the barrel meets the receiver) would mean your scope''s line of sight will mismatch the pellet''s trajectory. in most cases barrel droop causes the shots to land lower , and even relaxing the scope''s vertical adjustment to the fullest will not allow you to align the both. Here, another problem creeps in! since your vertical adjustment is relaxed, the spring holding the scope tube in place loses its control over the tube and the recoil causes the scope tube to vibrate hence yo lose your zero and need to re-adjust it after every couple of shots or so which eventually causes damage to the scope tube and you can say goodbye to your scope. there are many videos on youtube that explain barrel droop a lot better than i have :p so if you havent understood my gibberish here, refer to those videos :)', ''),

(434089, ' Bro it all boils down to your POU (Purpose of use) mine was CC from the very start. I knew I had to buy a weapon I could carry with ease and defend my life and the life of my family if ever God for bid the need arises. I have never used the 75D compact myself so cant share a first hand experience with you. Ive heard and watched great reviews about it  so it has to be a good weapon. The main difference b/w the two is the metal and polymer frame, a metal frame is ofcourse more durable than a polymer fram but then again it adds weight to the gun which I wont prefer in a day to day CC gun. As far as the duty is concerened, trust me the word DUTY says it all. So my advise to you would be to clear out your POU first before you make a choice b/w the two. Seldom carry, for HD/SD and for carry in your car if weight is not a issue go for the compact, else you can always look into the duty.', ''),

The Kanunis and the Caniks and the Salsimarzes would be around your budget as well. \r\n\r\nBut compact depends on your size, clothes style of dressing etc. \r\n\r\nThats why I chose The CF as it is not a big or bulky weapon as such.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust because safety/ decoker issue you are not in favor of CZ. \r\ncz and some clones made on cz pattern are excellent. \r\nIf one needs the durable, none other than CZ. \r\n\r\nhere is TT available with no safety / no decockers and people are dying to get TT.

Without such training or expereince its better to have a firearm that minimizes the chances of an AD as much as it can.

(434295, 'Nite Site [B]What is NiteSite?[/B]\r\n\r\nNiteSite is an innovative and unconventional way of shooting, in that you do not have your three points of contact to take a shot! You simply shoulder the rifle in a ‘heads up’ position viewing the cross-hairs of your day scope on the LCD screen mounted on the top of the scope! The NiteSite system has an infra-red camera that fits to a regular day scope using a flexible sleeve. Once the camera is put in place and connected to the LCD screen and illuminator module, the image of the cross-hairs is clearly visible on the LCD screen! It is that simple!\r\n\r\nThe LCD screen and illuminator module has an infra red beam that is switched in four increments from off to full by turning the switch on top of the illuminator unit. The infra red camera module can see the infra red light very clearly. This method of night vision can give a recognisable image up to a distance of 200 yards with the NS200 model, and in excess of 50 yards for the NS50 model. This will depend on the quality of the day scope optics that are in use at the time.\r\n\r\nNiteSite is a very easy way to achieve night vision for your day scope rifle combo. There is no need to remove your day scope for this system, there is no need for re-sighting your day scope recalibrating any part of your set-up for this system, it is a very easy plug and play system that will convert your day set up into a night vision set up in just a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nSo you can shoot throughout the night coupled with the day [B]without your prey even noticing you![/B] It''s a must for HUGE HUGE bags!!\r\n\r\n[B]Cost:[/B]\r\n\r\nNiteSite - NS50         £399.00 + £10 p&p* = PKR 60,000\r\nNiteSite - NS200        £599.00 + £10 p&p* = PKR 88,500\r\n\r\n[B]Some videos for practicality:[/B]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hLWVSCP5qNc[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFM7VdafL64&feature=g-u-u[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgzwYBee9eg&feature=channel&list=UL[/url]\r\n\r\n[B]To place your order visit[/B] [url]www.nitesite.co.uk[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nites.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nitesite.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/ns.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nss.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[U]Verdict:[/U][B]A must buy if you''re a keen vibrant hunter and have the budget![/B]\r\n\r\nWoooooooooohooooooooooooooooo I need one :)', ''),

You simply shoulder the rifle in a ‘heads up’ position viewing the cross-hairs of your day scope on the LCD screen mounted on the top of the scope! The NiteSite system has an infra-red camera that fits to a regular day scope using a flexible sleeve. Once the camera is put in place and connected to the LCD screen and illuminator module, the image of the cross-hairs is clearly visible on the LCD screen! It is that simple!\r\n\r\nThe LCD screen and illuminator module has an infra red beam that is switched in four increments from off to full by turning the switch on top of the illuminator unit. The infra red camera module can see the infra red light very clearly. This method of night vision can give a recognisable image up to a distance of 200 yards with the NS200 model, and in excess of 50 yards for the NS50 model. This will depend on the quality of the day scope optics that are in use at the time.\r\n\r\nNiteSite is a very easy way to achieve night vision for your day scope rifle combo. There is no need to remove your day scope for this system, there is no need for re-sighting your day scope recalibrating any part of your set-up for this system, it is a very easy plug and play system that will convert your day set up into a night vision set up in just a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nSo you can shoot throughout the night coupled with the day [B]without your prey even noticing you![/B] It''s a must for HUGE HUGE bags!!\r\n\r\n[B]Cost:[/B]\r\n\r\nNiteSite - NS50         £399.00 + £10 p&p* = PKR 60,000\r\nNiteSite - NS200        £599.00 + £10 p&p* = PKR 88,500\r\n\r\n[B]Some videos for practicality:[/B]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hLWVSCP5qNc[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFM7VdafL64&feature=g-u-u[/url]\r\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgzwYBee9eg&feature=channel&list=UL[/url]\r\n\r\n[B]To place your order visit[/B] [url]www.nitesite.co.uk[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nites.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nitesite.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/ns.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/nss.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[U]Verdict:[/U][B]A must buy if you''re a keen vibrant hunter and have the budget![/B]\r\n\r\nWoooooooooohooooooooooooooooo I need one :)[/quote]', ''),

(434451, ' AOA\nthanks allot dear pg brothers.\nit is a [B]springer spaniel[/B] dog \n\nThe English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game. It is an affectionate, excitable breed with an average lifespan of twelve to fourteen years. Descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century, the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to "rage syndrome", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely with the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. They are commonly used as sniffer dogs by various nations. The term springer comes from their historic hunting role, where the dogs would "spring" or "flush" birds into the air.\n\nand for more information plz see  \n\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Springer_Spaniel[/url]\n\nonce again thanks.', ''),

(434530, ' I have been shooting airguns for some years now, and I have a few observations. Of all the airguns, I have shot, I liked BSA and Wehrauch the best. The former I liked until a few years ago, and then their quality went downhill. The latter I have yet to find complaint  with. The best Weihrauch I have ever shot was a friend''s HW80 (tuned FAC version) imported from the UK. This gun had very smooth cocking, very tame recoil, an amazingly crisp trigger and awesome accuracy (with Crosman Premier pellets). \n\nWith my own FAC version HW80 (0.22cal), I have had outstanding accuracy shooting H&N Barracuda Match pellets. While these pellsts are not cheap, they are perhaps the best one can get for the more powerful springers and PCPs.\n\nThe airgun that I find the most fun and most accurate to shoot (out of the box) is the HW30. I have two of them (both 0.177 cal), and one of them has an after market spring and spring guide. These two parts cost me around USD100 but they are well worth the expense. The most accurate pellet in this gun has been the RWS Superdome. \n\nMy first airgun was a tap-loading, underlever 1916 model BSA (0.177cal) which belonged to my grandfather. I shot my first dove with it. Sadly this gun was lost by one of my cousins about twenty years ago. My second one was a BSA Meteor (0.177cal) which I got in 1986, and this I used till 2001, (with annual change of mainspring, piston seal and breech seal). This was more powerful and more accurate (using Eley Wasps), than the underlever gun, and with it I shot several thousand birds, mostly starlings, sparrows, pigeons and doves  (to feed my hawks). Sadly, I gave this gun to an deserving friend who wrecked it within a few months and returned to me in pieces. However, by that time I had gotten myself the HW80, which I use to this day. \n\nTwo years ago, I picked up another BSA Meteor (read parts in a plastic bag), so from the ashes of two Meteors, a new one wa ressurected a few months ago, and so far it hasbeen doing well. \n\nRegarding PCPs, my sincere advice to anyone using them or desirous of using them is to use dry air (also known as diver''s air) or then compressed nitrogen, as this too is a dry gas. Using air from a hand pump or a scuba compressor without a moisture trap and filter will cause condensation inside the gun and make it rust.', ''),

Previously it was British owned, now it is owned by Gamo. I guess that says it all.\n\nThe newer models of Diana have plastic parts, especially the trigger and a relatively poor build quality. I for one have no love lost for plastic components, and perhaps I have been spoilt by the triggers on my HWs.  \n\nSo, gentlemen, until something better than marketing gimmickry comes along, I shall stick to my old wood and steel relics.', ''),

It is an affectionate, excitable breed with an average lifespan of twelve to fourteen years. Descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century, the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to "rage syndrome", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely with the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. They are commonly used as sniffer dogs by various nations. The term springer comes from their historic hunting role, where the dogs would "spring" or "flush" birds into the air.\n\nand for more information plz see  \n\n[URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Springer_Spaniel[/URL]\n\nonce again thanks.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanks for the info Sarwar bro', ''),

The former I liked until a few years ago, and then their quality went downhill. The latter I have yet to find complaint  with. The best Weihrauch I have ever shot was a friend''s HW80 (tuned FAC version) imported from the UK. This gun had very smooth cocking, very tame recoil, an amazingly crisp trigger and awesome accuracy (with Crosman Premier pellets). \n\nWith my own FAC version HW80 (0.22cal), I have had outstanding accuracy shooting H&N Barracuda Match pellets. While these pellsts are not cheap, they are perhaps the best one can get for the more powerful springers and PCPs.\n\nThe airgun that I find the most fun and most accurate to shoot (out of the box) is the HW30. I have two of them (both 0.177 cal), and one of them has an after market spring and spring guide. These two parts cost me around USD100 but they are well worth the expense. The most accurate pellet in this gun has been the RWS Superdome. \n\nMy first airgun was a tap-loading, underlever 1916 model BSA (0.177cal) which belonged to my grandfather. I shot my first dove with it. Sadly this gun was lost by one of my cousins about twenty years ago. My second one was a BSA Meteor (0.177cal) which I got in 1986, and this I used till 2001, (with annual change of mainspring, piston seal and breech seal). This was more powerful and more accurate (using Eley Wasps), than the underlever gun, and with it I shot several thousand birds, mostly starlings, sparrows, pigeons and doves  (to feed my hawks). Sadly, I gave this gun to an deserving friend who wrecked it within a few months and returned to me in pieces. However, by that time I had gotten myself the HW80, which I use to this day. \n\nTwo years ago, I picked up another BSA Meteor (read parts in a plastic bag), so from the ashes of two Meteors, a new one wa ressurected a few months ago, and so far it hasbeen doing well. \n\nRegarding PCPs, my sincere advice to anyone using them or desirous of using them is to use dry air (also known as diver''s air) or then compressed nitrogen, as this too is a dry gas. Using air from a hand pump or a scuba compressor without a moisture trap and filter will cause condensation inside the gun and make it rust.[/QUOTE]\nBsa is not known for its quality in spring airguns but one of the best pcps.weihrauch has some good ones,And using a pcp in Karachi is not a good idea.Any kind of filling works fine in Islamabad except for rain season in summers.', ''),

Daud. now we are sitting in this gigantic office with an  aged Man, told him the problem and he said, Dont worry ... our guns are known to be rugged and relible, he himself inspected the Gun and experienced the malfunction...  called Mr Murad Ali and told him to give us a new Gun to replace this one and showed his great concern for this issue ...also he wanted to have report on how this happened and how to prevent it afterwards...Mr Murad Ali left....  again me, my friend and Mr Hakim-ud-din  are sitting there... he says... whats your program... i told him... i am going to go outside to have breakfast as i left RWP too early to have one already while gun gets ready.....  he say, why would you go outside just for a breakfast?  :)and goes back to his table.... 5 mins later there comes a guy with parathas, omelettes and tea, Wow.....  now he takes us to another table where breakfast is served...  after having breakfast.... he tells us to visit his factory as we please.... we wandered here and there, every single worker present there treated me like i am the new MD, or atleast just like its my own Uncle''s business place....  Mr Murad Ali showed me workshops and kept informing me about the specific machines and items.... and indeed this was no less than COOL.\n\n            at the workshop of shotguns.... they presented all three models of shooter and i picked 5+1...  fired it..... for fist time i shoulder fired a shotgun and i honestly salute all those people who do this every now and then specially with DSA guns.... coz after 3rd shot i seriously wished to stop the shooting and massage my shoulder... lol. anyway fired 10 shots with like a crying heart and mourning shoulder.... they punched my serial numbers on barrel and by a tiny mistake the word SHOOTER  gets double Pressed....  as i am seeing the barrel with a sad look.. just for a single ( R ) letter getting double pressed...... Mr Murad Ali notices my hesitation and orders to bring a new barrel....  again its test fired ( not by me,,, No sir )  numbers are punched thru that press machine.... barrel goes for powder coating...   then in a furnace for a while....  during that visit, most importantly i would like to add that  i talked to the workers there, my main question to every one ( even to Sir Hakim-ud-din ) was,,,, what is difference between shooter and security....how shooter is better than security version and all of them replied in their own words... i wont share what they said.... but i can tell you this, after reading so much about DSA on pakguns...and after talking to the actual people of DSA.and checking every tiny detail of manufacturing both shotguns...... all i can share is...what 12GAUGE says in his reviews about DSA shotguns is cent per cent Accurate. no one on pakguns knows DSA  better than him, anyway\n\nwhile barrel is getting done.... we are asked to come back in Mr Hakim-ud-din''s office.... as i enter, he says... Boys, tell me your names..  i introduced myself and my friend... i told him that i am a Constable in Rwp Police.... and after that we chatted for quite a while.....he showed me some of the Most expensive sxs shotguns i have ever seen and he asked me to have a feel of them.... there are 20, 12, and 410 gauge guns laying on table before me and none is less than exactly 4,400 euro''s.... :) Mr Hakim-ud-din appreciates me as i discuss with him about fire arms with a 1 cent worth of  knowledge that i have.....  he again picks the fone and asks me,,, have you ever enjoyed the mutton tikka karahi of peshawar... i tell him, No sir and please do not even think about it.... we already are so greatful to you for a nice breakfast.... but he insists and says... i would love to have your company during lunch time.... ok, i agreed.  guys brought mutton tikka karahi and chiken karahi, drinks and everything...  he personaly admired my attitude as i showed no formality in lunch and enjoyed it like i would in my own home :) we talked about law and order sitiuation, business, food, hunting and travelling......  i felt like i am talking with a young man of my age, he is that much attentive to me and we had some good laughs.....   my Gun gets ready,,,,  i plan to leave, he comes out of his office, walks with me to the main gate, every worker/guard present in that compound is walking with me now to escort me ....  we embraced each other,   said Good bye and  left.', ''),

So 100 rounds went through my gun.. NOT FTF NO FTE.. and NO FOULING of gun. I don''t care much about corrosiveness because cleaning is extensive after the shooting. So I went back and in two shifts bought about 1700 rounds but this time it was 19 rs due to huge number; in the whole lot ONLY 1 ftf happened and that too shot on the rehammering. \nAbsolutely fine round and am searching for it and NO ONE has it.\n\n@saadatpk Bhai..

Saadatpk bhai... I accept that american and euro ammo is top notch.. i am NOT disagreeing but the thing is the COST. what you can do for the shooting community is buy all the american ammo and supply at the local ammo rates .. if that is possible. EVERYONE will be more than happy with this.\n\nI have 10 rounds of all the above mentioned brands and will do the target testing while shooting.. but am more interested in Muzzle velocity as it is more important for me to see how much over pressure is coming from the round.

Based on pure looks Rami is a clear winner, though.[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=Verdana] \n(d) Caracal does not have enough track record (from my personal perspective) for me to trust it for EDC. However, I will get the F model for a spot of range shooting. Though,the C model feels better (despite the fact that I can''t get all my fingers on the grip) to shoot with, I intend to get the F simply to have (some limited) variety in terms of size.

This was a real bummer.\n\n Called some weeks later, still no 54/56. So I got interested in the HW80... have hunted alot with my cousin''s but never shot at paper targets so have no clue of it''s real accuracy... Yes it''s really accurate, but how does it compare to the 54/56? I know Weihrauch makes better guns.. help me decide.\n\n And will a Diana 1pc mount do?[/QUOTE]\nhw 80 is a good gun known for its lasting qualities but its no way as accurate as 54 and 56 its just another break barrel but a good one ,54 and 56 are as accurate as pcps.When the 350 magnum comes down to same velocity as hw80 and its properly tuned it will give same accuracy as hw80.And your friend is also selling his hw80 to get 54 or 56.', ''),

When anyone says a gun is less effective after ''x'' shots it just means spring becomes less powerful. Like everything in this world, mechanical stuff gets wear and tear with use. For more costly airguns it should be less gradual maybe for locals and Chinese this curve is steeper.\n\nWhen an airgun gets less effective, simply take it to a gun smith and ask for spring replacement. Then your gun should be as good as new  (provided you maintain/lube gun against corrosion etc.). But this cycle could evolve more frequently with some brands, and less frequent with other. Hence the marginal difference in costs.\n\nThere are obviously other factors like power and accuracy hence one brand is more an engineered product than the other but that''s another direction to debate...', ''),

An I mean absolutely takes the cake!!!\r\nWhen I went in he asked me my name area of residence as well as my profession. \r\n\r\nI asked him bout the now ubiquitous CF 98. He said he had different verities of em.. A used one for 42k at least 5 -6 years old. And Brand new ones for 38K and even “Pak assembled” ones for 32k.\r\n\r\nThe 32K ones were supposed to have been made  here with parts from China.  \r\nIf any one from the ‘Cheng feng” factory were to have seen this weapon he would have thrown his hands in despair and wept.

She was worth 45k and was sitting pretty in a Haji Ibrahim Arms company box. When I enquired about it he said that company had imported these pieces. However the grip panels bore the initials HIAC (Haji Ibrahim Arms Company) whereupon Ali sahib popped a Paan (Betel leaf) in his mouth spat tobacco juice in his hand and proceeded to inform me that Haji Ibrahim Arms Company had not only imported these guns but had Branded them as their own work!!!\r\n\r\nI felt a surge of pride at Haji Sahib’s unbelievable patriotism. He actually turned a horde of brand spanking new Russian toks into cheap local made knock offs solely to promote his Brand and Country…..\r\n\r\nThen I happened to mention Winamax TT. He showed me one.. wont sell it for a paisa less then 36k. Only this Winamax had no manual safety and when I pointed out the legend etched on the frame “Pak made Mouser” he told me the same thing. That the importers had asked the Chinese to put the “made in Pakistan” label to promote Pakistani Products\r\n\r\n (Sigh) I had to squeeze back tears at the sheer love these people had for Pakistan… Imagine taking high quality imports and trying to sell em as DA knock offs.. Amazing.\r\n\r\nWhen I convinced him I wanted a 9m with decocker. He showed me a sherpao arms used S & W in 60% condition. It had no decocker but it did have a manual safety. Completely broken and a hammer hard enough for the Rock to cock. Asking 28k\r\n\r\nFeelings:\r\n This guy is fun fun fuunnn..

And as such, the gun (and especially the trigger) requires a break in period of almost 300-350 rounds. The break in especially required in order to smooth out the trigger bar channel and the firing-pin block cylinder. My own Piranha''s trigger has become [B]much[/B] crisper after her break in.\n\n2) Agreed. The sights are, at best, simple "glow in the dark". They''re more suited for low-light conditions and are, in all honesty, absolutely useless in complete darkness.\n\n3) This is [B]VERY[/B] surprising to read. I''ve closely seen both the Scorpion and the Viking, and the Piranha''s finish is [B]infinitely[/B] better; the slide fit is perfect (the Scorpion, on the other hand, rattles if shaken), there are no burrs or factory marks (unlike the Viking which sports them like a slew of tattoos). Actually, as far as finish goes, my only complaint with the Piranha would be the "paint job"; wish it was more sturdy and "scratch proof", so to speak.\n\n4) This, I guess, is as much a functional feature as a preference. The Piranha, as I mentioned earlier, is a clone of the CZ75B. And the CZ75B is considered as one of the most accurate combat pistols in the world because it''s [B]not[/B] nose-heavy. First, by having the center-of-gravity of the gun at the grips, the operator is able to acquire/reacquire a target more quickly and is able to hold a straight line of aim at the target more easily. Second, shifting aim and general manipulation is easier if the weight of the gun is centered at the grip (where the operator''s hands are). The only downside is that the gun has more comparative muzzle-flip than a gun that''s nose-heavy.', ''),

Some are thinking even russian guns are better. I own Perazzi, Beretta and browning. Also turkish made huglu. Now thinking to buy Akus made webley trap gun. I can say Turkish made guns are even better than cheap series Beretta 686 guns. Akus makes 7 pin side by sides. Which are better than 471 series berettas.

I dont know Pakistans tax rates but since we import from Pakistan without custom tax it should be same for Turkish products to Pakistan.

NATO only has given "NATO quality assurance certification" (probably NATO Quality Standard AQAP 2110) for manufacturer, this certification is like ISO certification. Even CZ that makes world class handguns have only one "P-01" which is NATO approved, not all guns of CZ:)\nIt might be misleading by CANIK if they say the guns are NATO approved, just like at website CANIK55 says that their sights are Tritium Sights (which alone costs around US$100), which altogether is a misstatement, these are simply glow-in-light painted sights i.e. Luminescent rear and front sights.[/QUOTE]\n\nAgreed with Asif Ali, When none of Taurus handguns are Nato approved i doubt it any Turkish handguns will be.', ''),

(503564, '224 Harvey Kay-Chuk The late Jim Harvey of Lakeville Arms Co., Lakeville, Connecticut, developed this cartridge about 1956-57. It is fired in converted S&W K-22 revolvers. It is based on the K-Hornet wildcat cartridge, but there is also a 224 Kay-Chuk Jr., which is the standard 22 Hornet case trimmed back slightly. This cartridge is noted as being the inspiration for the Remington 22 Jet cartridge.\n\nThe idea of a high-velocity 22 handgun appealed to no small number of handgun hunters. What they wanted was light recoil combined with flat trajectory. The 224 Kay-Chuk accomplished this better than any previous handgun cartridge and, in fact, is superior to the actual velocity developed by the S&W 22 Jet revolver. A light 37-grain bullet designed by the late Kent Bellah, a noted writer and firearms authority, is usually used with 11 grains of powder #2400 producing a muzzle velocity of 1903 fps and muzzle energy of 308 fpe. He did much to introduce the Harvey-designed zinc base half-jacketed revolver bullets. The 224 Kay-Chuk is one of the most effective small game and varmint cartridge available for the handgun. Unfortunately, it''s a wildcat, hence not available on an over-the-counter, commercial basis. It has a straight body and sharp shoulder, unlike the long taper of the 22 Jet. Users of the 224 Kay-Chuk have reported that they do not have the extraction trouble and sticking cases that bother some 22 Jet users.', ''),

MKA1919 has a 19" barrel while 153 has 26 o28" barrel. So far MKA1919 has proven very durable to me. I have even fired Federal 3" Magnum rifled slugs through it and not a scratch in the barrel.

I think the Caracal people must either withdraw these or recall these for modifications so that once the slide breaks it is captured in the frame like in the case of Beretta 92 FS pistols.\nI submit my views based on observing the pictures of the barrel and the slide, I am very clear as to what happened.

(436537, ' Chauhdary bro! I reckon the most powerful non PCP airgun would not be a Gamo!! The problem with GAMOs is that they advertise their velocities using non lead alloy pellets which are neither accurate nor pack enough punch. To achieve 35 foot-pounds at muzzle an airgun needs to shoot 11 grain lead pellet at 1200 feet/sec... This i don''t think even the hunter extreme is capable of "Velocity: 1600 feet per second (fps) with PBA, 1250 fps with Lead" This is what Gamo advertises. Given your experience im sure you''re aware that 11 grain pellet tilts on the heavier side in .177 cal.

A certificate was issued by the Bundeswehr Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition (WTD 91) in May 2006 after the pistol successfully complied with the NATO D14 standard, the German Federal Police Standard and the German Federal Armed Forces Technical Purchasing requirements. These tests are the most stringent test protocols ever devised for a service firearm.\r\n\r\n[url]http://www.caracal.ae/new/certificates.php[/url]', ''),

Beretta 680-series.\r\n 2. Browning.\r\n 3. Miruko.\r\n 4. Bettinsolli.\r\n 5. Lanber.\r\n\r\n    Although TURKISH guns are rapidly catching up in the world of HIGH VOLUME CLAY SHOOTING,but\r\n still they need few years to come closer to BERETTAS or PERAZZI''S.They have SWEEPED the CLAY WORLD\r\n JUST CHECK ISSF.TV videos and you will see these two guns in Champions hands.', ''),

Just adding to my knowledge. Because the x40 one is as big a scope...[/QUOTE]\n\nYes ideally speaking wider objective lens provides better field of view and captures more light. The weight difference between 4-16x50 and 4-16x40 is 5 Oz (approx 142 grams) and length diff is approx 1 inch. If i remember correctly you''ve mounted an x50 scope on one of your airguns!! which mounts did you use? Because one needs really high mounts for the scope not to come in contact with the rifle!! Rest are pretty much the same on both scopes except I think the x50 scope wasn''t emerald quoted.

(437251, ' Salam All,\r\nOut of the 3, CZ 75B is the best option. The PT92/99 is another good option, but even though I own a Beretta 92, I think the Browning Lock Breach principle is more robust than the Beretta''s (or should I say Walther P-38''s) locking lug.\r\n\r\nThe CZ-999 is a very good handgun, but it is not an exact copy of the 226. I think it is one of the best budget options in Pakistan, but I would still rate the CZ 75B higher because its all steel(but since your friend wants it for HD so it should not be an issue). As far as carrying goes, its still the best option due to its slim profile. \r\n\r\nWith all respect to other opinions, I think the CZ 75B is the best of all the CZ''s, simply because its what made them famous, and all the rest are based on it. Another thing, if you all look at the CZ usa site, you''ll notice that they have reduced the frame length of the Shadow. This actually proves that frame length has nothing to do with accuracy. The Shadow is accurate simply because it does not have the firing pin safety hence a better trigger, but that makes it a range gun. If one wishes to go for a range gun, then he can chose between the Shadow or the CZ 85 Combat.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

(437406, ' A friend of mine tuned his 34 with non-factory spring and non-factory guide. He told me that he shot his 34 only a few times when he decided to redo his rifle. He is sending me the original parts he took out his rifle that I will use in my 34P.\n \nWhen I took the piston out of the chamber of my 34P, I found the internals bone-dry. I cleaned all parts. I closely examined the spring, guide and the seal. I found the spring bent in several places. The guide was loose within the spring. I examined the seal with a magnifying glass. It appeared to be in excellent condition. All the same, I will replace the seal also.\n \nA word of caution - the cocking slot and the slot in the piston have sharp edges. You may also find sharp edges if you have a metal spring guide. Remove these sharp edges with a small file.\n \nThere is debate about honing or not honing the cylinder. I opted to hone mine. I have a brake cylinder hone that has been with me for 40 or more years. I replaced the old stones with new 400 grit stones. The brake hone has adjustment for tension. Due to the design of this type of hone it can only be rotated past the cocking slot. Since the original stem of the hone is short, I used a rubber tubing to make an extension to reach the deep end of the cylinder.\n \nEven 400 grit is very abrasive when used dry. I read and followed the hint of another airgunner who immersed the cocking tube in big bucket of water and used an electric drill to rotate the hone with a back-and-forth motion for a cross-hash pattern. Such a pattern retains lubricants on the wall of the bore in which the piston travels. For this reason it is advisable not to have a mirror finish in the cylinder. If you plan to use a brake cylinder hone, pay attention and do not rotate the hone to a point where it may get stuck in the cocking slot and damage the gun and even injure you.\n \nIf you do not have a brake cylinder hone, you can use a wood dowel on which you wrap wet-dry emery cloth and do the honing by hand. You can use a PVC pipe with cut along the its length to hold the emery cloth. It is advisable to use water or some other agent for a finer finish in the bore. Make sure the cocking tube is thoroughly cleaned to remove any abrasive particles that may be in the bore.\n \nEssential lubricant for tuning is moly paste (molybdenum disulfide).  An air rifle attains very temperatures when it is fired. You may have seen someone’s air rifle “smoking” after being fired.  This “smoking” effect is called  “dieseling”. It can ruin an airgun. Any ordinary grease or oil in the chamber when compressed in airgun will ignite just like the mechanism as in a diesel engine - combustion by means of compressions.  Do not use any regular automotive grease in the compression chamber.\n \nI got my 60% paste from a Honda dealer. It is rated for temperature up to 400 degrees celcius for moving parts and 815 degrees for non-moving parts. Do not use any paste that is rated lower than 50%.  Use very thin coating of this paste around the edges of the seal, front bearing surface of the piston and the skirt portion of the piston. Wrap a paper towel on a dowel and apply very thin layer of moly paste on it. Now lubricate the piston tube with the dowel. Very carefully guide the piston in the cylinder so as not o cut or damage the seal. Use moly paste to lubricate any metal-to-metal contacts - the pivot bolt and the bolt washers come to mind.\n  \nI calculated the spring length (4.428 inches) when fully compressed. I did this by counting the number of turns in the spring and the thickness of the wire of the spring. I measured the available space inside the piston  (4.438 inches). I subtracted the compressed spring thickness from the available piston space. This gave me remaining space of (4.438-4.24) of 0.158 inch. I subtracted the thickness of the spring guide thrust washer (0.026 inch) from 0.158 with a balance of 0.132 inch space in the piston. My 34P did not have thrust washer in front of the spring. By adding a thrust washer in front of the spring I had remaining space (0.132-0.026) of 0.106 inch. This is sufficient space in the piston to cock the trigger.\n \nExamine the ends of the springs. If they are not smooth, bring them to a polish. I use my knife sharpening stone for this process. Stick a screwdriver near each end of the spring and remove any sharp inner ends. Polished spring ends help to lessen vibrations.\n\nAt times you may hear airgun making a “twang” sound. This noise comes about when the expanding spring hits the wall of piston. To dampen this noise use very viscous grease around outer edges of the spring. You can use NLGI (National Lubricating Grease Institute) Grade 4 grease. This grease is similar to the viscosity of the tar used in building roads. At times this grade of grease in our airgunning hobby is called “spring tar” as it is used on airgun springs.\n \nI will not touch the trigger assembly as I find the “feel” ok.\n  \nI hope the above is of some help.', ''),

(437508, ' Pakistan First, \n\nBuddy thank you so much for the detailed answer! Its good to come across someone who knows what he is doing. My first introduction to a tuned gun was an FAC rated HW80 tuned by a famous UK based tuner.This gun felt like a Jaguar XJ8 - smooth, powerful and quiet. It was a 0.177 cal gun and worked best with H&N Barracudas. \n\nFrom what little I have seen in Pakistan. I will not ever let any local "mistri" touch one of my guns. Cleanliness and professionalism are treated like diseases by these knaves, and I have seen many a good gun being spoilt by them. Including a few of my own.  \n\nA few years ago, I got a spring, spring guide and tar from James Maccari, and it was worth every dollar that I paid for it. \n\nOn a slightly unrelated note, or perhaps remotely related, I read, not too long ago, on an online forum, that airguns with leather seals, especially Chinese airguns benefit from a few cc of Slick 50 in the compression chamber. The trick is to first thoroughly clean the gun bone dry, by using carb cleaner, and leaving it aside for a day, so that by the next morning it is thoroughly dry. Then it should be put out in the sun, (the following day) for a few hours, and then it should be properly lubed (read sparingly, less is more, in this discipline as you may well know), taking care that no oil or lubricants find their way into the compression chamber. Then  using a hypodermic syringe sans the needle, about 1 cc of Slick 50 should be injected into the compression chamber via the transfer port. Next the barrel should be worked up and down about half a dozen times, taking care not to cock the gun. Now another 1.5cc should be injected into the transfer port, and the barrel worked up and down another eight times.  Then let the gun stand in the sun for another half an hour. After which, one may shoot through it some heavy pellets until such time that the gun stops dieseling. This is said to improve the sealing in the chamber, enhance lubrication, enhance seal life and boost compression, and consequently, enhance pellet velocity and energy too. I have yet to try this myself, but I am sorely tempted to get myself a Chinese gun and use it as guinea pig for this experiment and several more.\n\nLast, but not the least, you seem to live in California, so you are in the civilised world, but my advice to every fellow Pakistani who cares for his airgun, is not to let any desi mistri., specially not the dirty crooks in Lucky Star, Karachi, anywhere near there guns. Its like going for open heart surgery to a butcher!', ''),

Also I am sure I read very deep threads regarding SD/HD cases where some members of PakGuns who are also lawyers giving their advices.\n\nI am wondering if (May Allah keep his blessing and mercy on all of us!) any one us finds himself in SD/HD situation and have BGs killed, shouldn''t we have a thread where members can interact with real-life SD/HD lawyers and look for help from them.

(437596, ' Being a lawyer I have been asked this question many a times and explaining this is pretty difficult because it is a scenario based question; mainly because circumstances of each and every case decide it was culpable to a SD or not. BUT if it is a HD scenario just kill that bastard if he has entered your home. NO EXCUSE to it, it will almost always become a SD if he is dead. \r\n\r\nIn a SD scenario BEST option will always be .. Take a decisive action without fear.. translate it in urdu.. CHORNA MAT USSKO .. \r\n\r\nThe SD scenario will always have to have a story line as what has happened.. you will have to explain that what were you doing there and what really happened.. WHY was it that you took out your gun and killed that SHARIF insaan..\r\nMany a lawyers these days cross certain limits to save the client after all that is their duty.. (here client means BG).. if he is alive.. BOTH sides will say that the other person is the BG. SO if ONE is dead; all the other has to do is explain his story.. maximum police will take the weapon and ask for you to get a court order.. YOU will CERTAINLY need a lawyer here, this has happened in Karachi but here the story is different from anywhere in Pakistan. LEAVING a BG is seriously dangerous.. more than anything because you will surely be in a fix by the same BG that you shot.\r\nSecondly there are self defense sections in the Pakistan Penal Code. i.e the law the sets the punishments of crimes and defines what event is specific crime and the reasons.. I am copying here the sections relating to self defense.\r\n\r\nIN HD if you kill that trespasser he wont be able to say anything that will be a lie or wont be able to mingle his version of story into the truth that you say.. heck he can even say that "mera iss ki behan/ beti say ishq tha. aur ghar par bulaya baat karnay kay liye aur goli mar dee.. yeh unlicensed pistol bhi unhon nay hee rakha hai." explaining that will surely put you and your family at peril. Any one that trespasses MUST be dealt with swiftly and decisively; it is absolutely legal till this point.. and if you happen to kill his friend/ second adversary outside then drag his body inside so that excessive usage of force is not implied. You may not have a problem with the killing of the person inside.. but the person who did not enter inside yet you killed him would tantamount to a culpable murder meaning life term. The law is like this .. and you have to follow the law no matter it doesnt appeal to your mind or seems illogical.\r\n\r\n[B][U][I]Relevant sections of Pakistan Penal Code:[/I][/U][/B]\r\n\r\n[B]100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.[/B] The right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:\r\n\r\nFirst.

Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.

When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.[/B] The right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm, to the wrongdoer, )f the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely;\r\nFirst. Robbery;\r\nSecondly. House-breaking by night;\r\nThirdly. Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property;\r\nFourthly. Theft, mischief or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not exercised.\r\n\r\n[B]104., When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.[/B] If the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right of private defence, the theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrongdoer of any harm other than death.\r\n\r\n[B]105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.[/B] The right of private defence of property commences when a reasonable apprehension of danger to the property commences.\r\nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat with the property or either the assistance of the public authorities is obtained or the property has been recovered.\r\nThe right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or of instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues.\r\nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief.\r\nThe right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the house-trespass which has been begun by such house¬breaking continues.\r\n\r\n[B]106. Right of private defence against deadly assault when there is a risk of harm to innocent person.[/B] If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the apprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk.\r\n\r\n[B][U]Illustration[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nA is attacked by a mob who attempts to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by so firing he harms any of the children.\r\n\r\n[B][U]Extent of right of private defence: The law relating to self-defence has made the victim of such an assault the Judge of his own peril and permitted him to repel the attack even to the taking of the life of his assailant so the Courts are to judge him by placing themselves in the same position in which he was placed. If the harm caused to the offending party is out of all proportions to the harm which may be received or which is threatened by the other party, and which gives occasion for the exercise of that right of self-defence will stand completely negatived.[/U][/B]\r\nIt is no offence to arm oneself in anticipation of an attack.\r\n[B][U]\r\nThis right is available only if it is rooted in good faith. Person cannot be expected to weigh his blows in golden scales while exercising his right of private defence. Right of private defence continues so long as apprehension of hurt or grievous hurt continues. Right of private defence or property commences when an act which is an offence of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass is committed or an attempt to commit such an offence is made. However, this right ceases when thief has reiterated with property.[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nThis means that a person when acting in self defence is absolutely under the law when delivering his blows TILL the time he feels that he is absolutely sure that the threat has subsided where he DOES NOT feel in danger.. it is an open question to be answered according to the circumstances.. IMHO if you keep on shooting at the bad guy and DO NOT KNOW whether you have hit him more than ONCE even then you are covered.. BUT it all depends on what has really happened.', ''),

(437625, ' [QUOTE=Turumti;275777]Pakistan First, \n\nBuddy thank you so much for the detailed answer! Its good to come across someone who knows what he is doing. My first introduction to a tuned gun was an FAC rated HW80 tuned by a famous UK based tuner.This gun felt like a Jaguar XJ8 - smooth, powerful and quiet. It was a 0.177 cal gun and worked best with H&N Barracudas. \n\nFrom what little I have seen in Pakistan. I will not ever let any local "mistri" touch one of my guns. Cleanliness and professionalism are treated like diseases by these knaves, and I have seen many a good gun being spoilt by them. Including a few of my own.  \n\nA few years ago, I got a spring, spring guide and tar from James Maccari, and it was worth every dollar that I paid for it. \n\nOn a slightly unrelated note, or perhaps remotely related, I read, not too long ago, on an online forum, that airguns with leather seals, especially Chinese airguns benefit from a few cc of Slick 50 in the compression chamber. The trick is to first thoroughly clean the gun bone dry, by using carb cleaner, and leaving it aside for a day, so that by the next morning it is thoroughly dry. Then it should be put out in the sun, (the following day) for a few hours, and then it should be properly lubed (read sparingly, less is more, in this discipline as you may well know), taking care that no oil or lubricants find their way into the compression chamber. Then  using a hypodermic syringe sans the needle, about 1 cc of Slick 50 should be injected into the compression chamber via the transfer port. Next the barrel should be worked up and down about half a dozen times, taking care not to cock the gun. Now another 1.5cc should be injected into the transfer port, and the barrel worked up and down another eight times.  Then let the gun stand in the sun for another half an hour. After which, one may shoot through it some heavy pellets until such time that the gun stops dieseling. This is said to improve the sealing in the chamber, enhance lubrication, enhance seal life and boost compression, and consequently, enhance pellet velocity and energy too. I have yet to try this myself, but I am sorely tempted to get myself a Chinese gun and use it as guinea pig for this experiment and several more.\n\nLast, but not the least, you seem to live in California, so you are in the civilised world, but my advice to every fellow Pakistani who cares for his airgun, is not to let any desi mistri., specially not the dirty crooks in Lucky Star, Karachi, anywhere near there guns. Its like going for open heart surgery to a butcher![/QUOTE]\n\nMy local sargodha made airgun (Paragon) is available for experimenting ;) when are you free? BTW i need to run a trick or two on my Hatsan 135 IF and WHEN it arrives :p', ''),

"Mera chakkar iss ki behan/ beti kay saath tha." and get away from his role as BG and convert the person in SD situation on a attempt to murder under section 324 PPC.\n3) leaving BG alive raises another option of solving the FIR(of 324 PPC) or possibly a 22-A PPC petition an impossible feat as it would turn into a HUGE legal Battle spanning in most circumstances over a year.. normally.\n4) Leaving a BG alive will demoralize and put the entire family to live in fear of back lash.\n5) BG is better dead.. one less filth on the road.

Hence this awkward conceal carry is imposed which has NO support from the Legislation and LAW.. the ONLY support it has comes from the notifications under the Home Department only. NO ONE has yet challenged it in court but untill someone does and wins the legal battle till then we do have to follow the notification and carry a gun with 144 permit duly issued by the department.\n\nI am here as an Advocate who has had about 10 years of experience of full fledged lawyer as well as 3 years of experience as junior clerk.. (While studying law was already working with a lawyer, learning tricks of trade). Any ways.. if i can be of any help i will surely do so.[/QUOTE]\n\nBro. 144 carry permit never say that weapon must be carried separately from body.\nLEA stopped persons carrying Licensed Arms in 99% attached with body and never said any word, they just checked proper documentation and 144 permit only.\nIf not attached to body, weapon become quite useless to carry.:)', ''),

The KAC expert around about 9k. I bought it last week incidentaly. \n\nIf you have still more a bigger budget then get a Hatsan MP-A at around 40k Available at guns and accassories zamzama and Pak armoury Burhani centre M.A Jinnah Road.  This weapon has fibre optic front sights, ghoast ring sights, piston for fast cycling and is an excellent clone of the Benali m 4.

And also slug barrel as well as flash suppreser.\n\nIf U can go up to 65k u can get the Akdal M1919. It looks like an M16 on steriods! Availabe at just bout all dealers\n\nIf u can go upwords to 120k then of course the one an only option Saiga 12 combat shotgun.

(437994, ' I don''t collect any particular type of gun, just whatever attracts my attention.  That I can afford, anyway.  I''m located in the state of Arkansas in the USA, which is a relatively gun-friendly place.\r\n\r\n Norinco .45 ACP.  This is a Chinese copy of the Colt 1911.  It has a plain black Parkerized finish and shoots very well.  I''ve owned "better" pistols, but I can actually *hit* stuff with this one...\r\n\r\n FEG .45 ACP.  This one is from Hungary, not very common here.  It looks a bit like a Browning Hi-Power, but the insides seem to be more like a Smith & Wesson.  I haven''t had a chance to shoot it yet.  I bought it without seeing it first, and was surprised to find it''s even bigger than a 1911!  Seems to be well-made.\r\n\r\n Mossberg 500 12-gauge pump shotgun, 28" barrel.  Just a basic inexpensive shotgun.\r\n\r\n Model 1891 Argentine Mauser, 7.65x53 caliber.  This one is in original condition.  I bought it about 25 years ago, when 7.65 ammunition was unobtainable here.  It was my first rifle, and I learned how to make brass for it by cutting down .30-06 brass.  It''s not a collector-grade rifle, but it''s in good shape and I like it.\r\n\r\n Model 91/30 Mosin-Nagant.  Made in the USSR in 1943, original condition, with bayonet and accessories.  These are still very inexpensive here since the Russians sold cargo containers full of them to American importers.  \r\n\r\n 7.7 Arisaka, sporterized.  It has an American-made sporter stock instead of a cut-down military stock.  It was a gift from a friend. \r\n\r\n 1986 Romanian AK-47.  I built it from a "kit".  When the Romanian government disposed of a bunch of surplus rifles a few years ago, they cut them with torches, put the pieces in a plastic bag, and sold them as "parts kits."  These were then legal to import and purchase in the USA.  There are many businesses here that sell repair parts and tools.  In compliance with Federal law, it is semi-automatic only.\r\n\r\n Pattern 17 Enfield in .30-06.  At the moment it is completely disassembled; the barrel is off, bolt is apart, etc.  Someone had butchered the stock trying to sporterize it.  I bought it around 1986, to rebarrel in .300 H&H or something, but I''ve decided to put it back together the way it was and shoot it - the barrel is perfect.   I''m keeping an eye out for a nice stock for it.', ''),

It would be  great for starters. It retails around 42k in Karachi.  It has firing pin safety, loaded chamber indicator hammer block safety and sports a control lever that acts both as manual safety as well as decocker and low recoil + plus its light as well.  \n\nThe Stoeger cougher is also a great weapon.

(438054, 'Before purchasing an IZH-27 Hi,\n \nI am a newbie here and in shooting, too. I am looking for a hunting gun which I will also use for clay shooting (not much, let’s talk about some 200 rounds per month). My budget is EUR 500.00 as I am a little bit short of money and it looks like this situation won’t improve in the near future. I know that some people recommend purchasing a used Marocchi or Lanber for this price but in Central Europe where I live, it’s nearly impossible to get a  used shotgun made by these manufacturers for such an amount. Common prices in this category start from EUR 750.00. So in my point of view, it‘s a dead end. \n \nThat`s why I am thinking about the brand new Baikal IZH-27EM-1C Nickel 12ga that I can get at the local gun shop for EUR 425.00 which is perfectly in my limits. However, before purchasing it, I would like to hear advices and opinions from you, experienced connoisseurs of this Russian shottie.\n \nI have read tons of threads and articles regarding the IZH-27 and I am aware of possible risks (after all, it is not Beretta nor Perazzi). That’s why I would like to avoid as many issues as possible before purchasing it. Let me resume the most commons of them that I have collected on american, european and russian forums and that were reported by various users.\n \n•     ejecting both shells after firing only one, especially when the gun gets hot after a long shooting session. Possible solution: a thorough cleaning of internal parts or polishing ejector which somehow touches the  forestock as it moves. Another possible reason is that the carrier pushes the barrel selector too far, in such case, shortening the carrier’s tail will be necessary.\n•     ejectors tend to crack (?)\n•     the metallic part which is located between the over and under barrel (it’s the part which fills the space between the barells – sort of rail – sorry, I couldn’t find a proper word in English) – tends to get loose after several hundred of shots...\n•     during first 500 rounds, some kind of red colored sand or dust (perhaps the same preservative which can be found in the receiver of new uncleaned gun) comes out from the space between barrels (as described above). How can I avoid this?\n•     if two slugs are shot respectively from both barrels on a paper target, they do not hit the same spot. I consider this as normal but some people report a 1.5 feet difference (!) Is this possible?\n•     doubling (both barrels shoot at the same time). Possible problem: either bad technique when pulling the trigger or cleaning and lubing of internals is required – anything else that comes into your mind?\n•     curved rib (not aligned with the upper barrel)\n•     sometimes the gun tend to open spontaneously right after the shot is made (especially when magnum cartridges are used) – how can be avoided this?\n•     some users report that the empty shell can get under the ejector after being fired, then it’s a hell to get it from the barrel – that’s what I am most worried about – I suppose the solution would not be an easy one?\n•     the under barrel‘s hammer strikes weakly which results in failing the primer to ignite. This is caused either by some kind grease or a mess present in the internals (cleaning) or it can occur when the hammer spring comes in contact with the internal part of the stock on its way, hence it looses some portion of energy and when it finally hits the primer, the hit is not sufficient enough to ignite the primer. The Russians recommend fine polishing the right or left internal side of stock (the spot where the hammer spring comes into contact with the wood). Any other possible issues?\n•     after several hundreds of shots made in a short time (and especially if the outside temperature is high), it’s impossible to open the gun. Some people say all they have to do is wait like 20 seconds and then it’s possible to break the barrels. This happens when using cartridges with high brass (some other people state the contrary though). Possible solution: a thorough cleaning, lubing of internals or polishing the chambers with the steel wool\n•     the forestock finish tends to flake away after a couple of months\n•     front sight is not located right in the center of rib – what to do? I would like to install the Tru-glo sight but how, is that complicated?\n•     some people report that the chambers are too large which causes the shell would expand after the shot and consequently, the ejector is unable to remove it. Basically, when inserting the cartridge into the chamber, there should be no free space at the sides of the shell.\n•     stiffness, stiffness, stiffness...\n•     barrel selection not working at some guns\n•     safety is too rigid, reported problems with spontaneous activation/deactivation after the first shot.. how can this be cured?\n•     material used on some barrels is not equally distributed along the whole circumference. E.g. if you are looking down the barrel from the front sight, you can see some parts of the barrel rim are thicker while the rest is thin.\n \nThat’s it for the known issues. I know it is very unlikely to encounter all of these problems at the same time but I prefer to know about them and to have a solution if something happens. I think that a lot of these issues can be avoided  right in the shop by eliminating defective IZHs (provided the choice is wide enough). This is the list of things to be checked before purchasing the gun at the shop (I will skip the part regarding the proper gun fitting as this is a general question which applies to any shotgun). What to check:\n \n1.   quality of material used, mainly the equal diameter of the barrel rims\n2.   check the inside of the barrels if it is clean and equal\n3.   no signs of corrosion\n4.   quality of wood and finish\n5.   if the barrels are straight (sometimes the under barrel is not aligned with the upper one)\n6.   check if the gun is not „wobbly“, if all parts stay together\n7.   correct center position of the front sight\n8.   check the correct position of the rib (has to be straight)\n9.   check the diameter of both chambers by inserting the cartridge if it fits perfectly\n10. check the function of both ejectors and extractors using an empty shell. First, „fire“ both barrels and check if both shells are ejected, then repeat with only upper/under barrel.\n11. check the correct function of the under hammer. The Russians do that this way: they would cock the hammer by breaking the barrels, then remove the forestock, barrels off, then they would put an empty shell on the spot where the under hammer strikes, and then they would shoot. The empty shell is supposed to fly at least one meter high provided the stock is pointed to the roof. If it only flies like 1 feet, the hammer is not strong enough => problem.\n12. what else?\n \nMaybe some of you would think I am crazy and anxious by editing these long lists but there is a lot of problems related with this shotgun. I understand I can’t expect Beretta quality but what I am looking for is a reliable gun which will serve well without apparent problems like doubling, ejecting full shells or jammed opening. I also know I am not buying the prettiest gun of the world but I still believe this gun is a good product with quality material used. I am ready to clean the internals of the IZH right after the purchase. However, this brings me to another question: will I loose the warranty when cleaning the receiver? Am I allowed to disassemble the gun? I also would like to make some modifications like fine polishing of all internal parts using Dremel, shorten the ejector springs to reduce the stiffness etc. However I don’t think this can be done without loosing warranty. I would also like to improve the finish of the stock and the forestock. \n \nI apologize for this long post but I would be grateful for any information you can provide re this shotgun. Please feel free to comment and/or to complete the lists above. Thanks in advance.', ''),

Make sure you check your id card number, gun number, address and your name and father''s name on it.

Uncle Mike''s, Sidearmor and Bladetech are a some holster makers that utilize Kydex in their holster designs......[/SIZE]\n[SIZE=4]\n.....[I][B]Kydex holsters have a number of advantages over leather and nylon. They are waterproof, scratch resistant, lightweight and hold their shape which makes re-holstering your gun much easier than with a less rigid leather holster.[/B][/I] One important drawback of kydex holsters is their limited flexibility. Where leather holsters are supple and conform easily to the body, kydex is a rigid thermoplastic that lacks this same flexibility."\n\nI recently got a kydex holster custom made for my M57... . Carries close to the body which is good for conceal carry. Retention of the M57 is excellent. I turned it upside down and shook it and the gun just wont fall out. I really like this holster.\n\n[/SIZE][/QUOTE]\n\nAgreed bro, just want to clarify one thing, about the re-holstering the leather holster thing. Leather holsters, such as i got made for the Caracal, have steel/plastic inserts in them so that they maintain the shape and are super easy to re-holster because they don''t flex. The holster i got above has the looks and class of leather but the feel and grip of kydex. My gun also doesn''t fall out when shaken upside down, because it has that re-tension of a kydex type.

(438593, 'Basic safety drills to counter abduction attempts Dear Friends, \r\n\r\nToday i received an assessment of a security company working for our office about abduction and how to counter it. \r\nAccording to their assessment unfortunately Pakistan is one of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of high abduction rates on annual average basis. :( Although this may not be correct, and i hope the security situation is not so bad, still there is always a need to be cautious. \r\nFollowing are some of the basic measures to counter an abduction/kidnapping attempt which can be further added to by senior members here. \r\n\r\n1.	You are vulnerable anytime your time and place are predictable. Vary your routine by changing the times and routes to and from work and home.\r\n  \r\n2. 	Also make sure to vary the length of time to and from work and home.  Do so by a factor longer than the perpetrators can comfortably stay in place (more than 10-15 minutes)\r\n\r\n3.	Avoid wearing clothing or accessories (including jewelry) that might indicate wealth or identify you as a foreigner or identify you as an employee of a wealthy domestic or foreign company.\r\n \r\n4.	Maintain constant awareness of your surroundings and avoid known hotspots. \r\n\r\n5.	Avoid traveling alon, if possible. Remember there is always safety in numbers.\r\n\r\n6.	Seek advice from truested locals as to safe and unsafe areas of the location both by day and at night if visit a new place. Avoid dimly-lit areas. Walk purposely and use the centre of the pavement, thus avoiding unlit doorways and being too close to the roadway.  \r\n\r\n7.	A privately owned car generally offers the best security.\r\n \r\n8.	If no personal or office vehicle available, use reputable, licensed taxi companies only, metro etc. Take note of the license plate number. \r\n\r\n9.	Keep your automobile in good repair and the gas tank at least half full. In some cases, having a trained and vetted driver may be the best option. \r\n\r\n10.	Always know the locations of your embassy and consulate offices if out of your home country.\r\n\r\n11.	Be aware of the street environment and pay attention to suspicious or erratic behavior in strangers.  If such behavior is observed, seek a safer location by entering a store or bank, or simply cross the street.\r\n\r\n13.	When traveling secure all your personal items. Especially money, passports, travel documents and laptops.\r\n\r\n14.	Keep personal, work and travel information on a strictly need-to-know basis.\r\n\r\nKEEP SAFE AND STAY VIGILANT…..ALWAYS\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nFahim', ''),

My baikal after shooting a lot of slugs, i had to clean it. The inside of the bore was absolutely full of lead. I didnt have any brush so i did this... i took a scoch bright [URL]http://www.4mailers.com/Images/ProductImages/3734_xl.jpg[/URL] and i pased it several times inside the bore. I did it as many times as needed for the lead to take out. Ofcourse i used a solvent. I must mention that the guns bore is chrome plated if you dont know. The result was far from taking out the lead, that the inside of the bore got scraches. Some are less deep and some more deep. They are not easy visible. I must turn the bore to light and look very focused to see them, but the inside is full of litle scratches. Get a scoch bright and clean a chromed metal you will se what i mean....

One will have to do a lot of research on design and material type for making one. I dont know if people are already making them for sale. As far as i have read air regulators need to be serviced often. Also not every PCP is fitted with a regulator and they happen to be accurate. Regulator as far as i understand, just evens out air pressure for consistent velocities. Since a PCP doesn''t face recoil issues like a spring piston gun, the initial 20-30 shots should be considerably consistent. Accuracy may be compromised when the velocity drops by say ummm 100-150 fps or may be more right?\n\nAs for the velocities of the gun under question, if i remember correctly the initial 10-15 shots were between 55-60 fpe from a 0.25 cal BT65. I posted some video links on the Diana PCP thread. One video also showed how to fir an air pressure regulator and shooting difference before and after installing it.\n\n@Khan09, cant access facebook from work :p will check once im home', ''),

The last few pictures were for those which were sold to me (so foolish of me) at almost 75k, and I happily paid upfront (again foolish of me) for something which does not work at all. The limbs are practically bended pieces of Mild Steel Strips (cheapest metal available and hard as hell) and the total weight of the bow is more than 6 kgs (standard weights vary around 4lbs). And when I asked for a refund it was a blatant big "NO". You can get a WinWin or a Hoyt recurve for that price. And as for the Fiber Limbs which he has quoted at 43k well you can get a branded pair for around 100 dollars. As for the stabilizer (which is a joke), its just a piece of wood attached to a metal rod which by the way cant be screwed in and out for more than a dozen times as the threads are so pathetic. Same goes for the threads of the riser, and I basically had to use 4 different sizes of bolts to attach the limbs to the wooden riser.\n\nSo, if anyone is thinking of starting Archery please buy a branded Bow and Arrows.

(438865, ' Slugs are MOSTLY rifled pieces of lead i.e. grooves are on the pellet instead of the shotgun, see it as reversed role. The rear of the slug is dented inside to ensure that when it goes through the barrel of shotgun the thin ridge presses and makes a complete seal as the lead is very soft.\nSecondly the pellets in buckshots have a follower inserted, when they are pressed forward the pressure pushes then so fast that due to inertia they DONT leave their place and are rolled inside the barrel. This way the scratching doesn''t happen, This is a strange phenomena. if this was done to the smaller pellets and not encased in wad then the outer thin pellets would almost evaporate leaving the center ones to work. The follower is tightened against the barrel and it pushes the liquid lead out at the same time.. it is very negligible but still it cleans the barrel.. After many many shots, as you yourself have experienced the lead gets deposited inside the barrel.

(438872, ' [QUOTE=atiq;277132]Slugs are MOSTLY rifled pieces of lead i.e. grooves are on the pellet instead of the shotgun, see it as reversed role. The rear of the slug is dented inside to ensure that when it goes through the barrel of shotgun the thin ridge presses and makes a complete seal as the lead is very soft.\nSecondly the pellets in buckshots have a follower inserted, when they are pressed forward the pressure pushes then so fast that due to inertia they DONT leave their place and are rolled inside the barrel. This way the scratching doesn''t happen, This is a strange phenomena. if this was done to the smaller pellets and not encased in wad then the outer thin pellets would almost evaporate leaving the center ones to work. The follower is tightened against the barrel and it pushes the liquid lead out at the same time.. it is very negligible but still it cleans the barrel.. After many many shots, as you yourself have experienced the lead gets deposited inside the barrel. I used to clean the heavily pitted barrel with 100 C boiling water and then followed by a reamer rotated spring brush dipped in HOT oil. This used to push all the lead out in small tid bits. BUT i wouldn''t recommend to you to do it.[/QUOTE]\n\ni see. i hope the fact that the gun is 12/89 dosnt affect the quality shot when firing 70mm shells. when firing a shell, until the shot leaves the shell and goes into the cone, the 19mm distance can ruin the shot?', ''),
(438873, ' I read your FIRST post again. IMHO i think because of shooting slugs too many a times.. the barrel must have gotten real hot.. \ndid you shoot it fast.. such as 20 or 30 slugs in short time..

The hotter the barrel is the more wear it will have on the slug grooves, i.e. instead of slipping on the barrel the lead must have started glowing.. and turned to liquid.. thus leaving slug marks. Look carefully for it.. this is a good possibility\n\nIt is NOT preferred that you use a larger cartridge in a shorter chamber mainly because it produces more chamber pressure than the gun is proofed at. Fire one more slug and look at the outer edges of the shell at the front protion, are they pressed or too much scraped from the inside on the front side; if they are then you should not use 70mm shells get the smaller ones. Secondly take a same company smaller shell as their plastics will be the same and fire a normal small pellet shell and then check the thickness of the used shell with the slug shell as well as compare them with an unfired shell of small pellet.

I fell unconscious after drinking it,”\r\n the Daily Times quoted him as saying. \r\nWhen Khalil got back his consciousness, he saw that three women were forcibly committing sex with him. For four consecutive days they sexually assaulted him and later threw him near Qayyumabad river, said assistant superintendent of police Asad Raza.\r\n “His condition is really bad ... his genitals are bleeding and he cannot walk properly,” \r\nsaid Raza. \r\nAccording to Raza those women must belong to some rich families from Karachi’s Clifton area.\r\n “It’s a complicated case ... but we are hoping that we will solve it soon,”\r\n he added."\r\n\r\nRead more: [url]http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/266461#ixzz1zGignOVF[/url][/quote]', ''),

As PG is a discussion forum, healthy discussion is a good sign here and provides the learning oppertunities for all of us. \nAs per my [B]personal[/B] opinion few submissions (though there are lot more factors in detail discussion):\n1. Eley is one of the best cartridge in the World with consistent quality of its pattern, load, smooth feeding and ejecting and hardly misfires  if used in compatible gun.\n2. Shaheen is also a good cartridge in its price when compared to the prices of imported ammo in the market. However its quality control is very poor in batch to batch production. Ordinance Factory is in-consistent in the quality of shot gun cartridges. Misfires, Feeding and Ejecting issues are normal in some production lots. Imagine the situation of a shooter who attempts a mallard or partridge and the cartridge does not fires.\n3. As fasr as No.4, 6 or 8 is concerned, it depends upon the shooting envoirnment, target, gun choke and personal confidence of the shooter.\n[B][U][I]4.

The versatility, adaptability and flexibility of patio furnishings make them a quality investment for anyone. In fact, incorporating them on your patio or any open setting will allow you to increase the functionality of that particular outdoor space. In addition to that, they can also greatly enhance the physical features of the area where you have integrated them.\n\nThe use of patio furniture has become more evident over the recent years. The truth is many adore their simple yet elegant designs and styles. Patio furniture pieces offer homeowners a practical way of creating an entertaining outdoor space while still preserving the formality of a dining or living room set. With a myriad of patio furniture sets available, homeowners can practically incorporate them in any open space inside the house, whether in the sunroom, porch, garden, or any areas where they wish to lounge and relax. Moreover, patio furniture sets are not only about tables and chairs, in fact, there is an array of furniture selection to choose from. This may include hammocks, garden benches, and umbrellas.\n\nRemember that every kind of patio furniture is designed to serve a particular purpose. They can be used for storage, for accentuating a particular space, blocking the sun rays, or as alternative seating options. These furniture pieces are practically produced from a wide variety of materials including wood and aluminum. The type of patio furniture that you need to purchase will greatly depend on your preference, and budget. For instance, those looking for long-lasting and high-quality patio furniture sets should definitely go for those made from durable wood. Meanwhile, those who are seeking for a more affordable option must look into patio furniture sets made from light weight aluminum or plastic.\n\nNo matter what type of outdoor patio furniture sets you decide to acquire, make sure that you go for those with good quality and functional features. You can also change the look of your patio sets with a nice set of patio furniture cushions. Another, what most men would consider nice patio furniture would be a nice Gas BBQ Grill.

The cocking requires a bit of effort initially i reckon it is very hard for an average person (I am 6,3'' and 92 kgs) and still it gave me a workout. So this not NOT a gun for kids, it is also on the heavier side with a significant bit of recoil. \r\n\r\nThe included sling is a blessing. The bipod is ummm well average and i do not think i will use it a lot. The included scope is pretty impressive i must say. It will however reveal its true colors once mounted but the construction looks solid, it has illuminated red reticle with different adjustments for brightness, included two spare batteries, optics are pretty clear, and it has adjustable focus at the eye piece. It came with a sturdy scope stop, the provided rings are OK but i''d prefer rings with 2 screws on each side. The gun shoulders well, the trigger is to my liking, crisp and clean release and it can further be adjusted although i do not intend to play around with it any time soon.

I don''t remember if a thumb print was required or not. I went to NADRA myself as there was no dealer involved. It was 5 days after that that they gave me the demand note. But call NADRA on 051-111 786 100 and give them the tracking number on your demand note to verify the details (i.e., your name and NIC no). If those check out, I should think you are good to go.

You are around the corner in an unmarked car with a tape recorder and earphone.  The criminals are becoming suspicious and abusive.

You are watching an armed robbery in progress.\r\n\r\n You now know everything the character does at this point.  After you read the next paragraph,  you have three seconds to make a decision.\r\n\r\n The robbers are lining the customers of the shop up facing the wall, execution style, and show every sign of getting ready to start shooting.  Meanwhile, you hear shouts and gunfire over the radio.  You jump out of the car.\r\n\r\n Your decision:  where are you going?\r\n\r\nthree...two...one.  Your time is up.\r\n\r\n Which way did you go?  And most importantly, why?\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n(1.

It didn''t fit :p I put the provided stock spacers in place and it increased the gun''s length by approx 1.5". If i pull em out it will fit in the bag but I guess i''ll have to order one as I am pretty comfortable with that length.\r\n\r\nThe H&N wadcutters are surely lighter than the Gamos as they caused the rifle to diesel and about 3 shots produced a crack louder than normal. Also they didnt fit so tightly as the Gamos did, some were pretty lose. I shot about 30-35 H&N pellets and the results were good but Gamos were better. Also, the dieseling worried me a little so i may not use them often. Due to bad light i called it a day but the results are still impressive.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to scope this gun any time soon.

Did your package include an extra scope stop? Use the pix I''ve posted for reference on how to mount the scope with that extra scope stop. I will strongly suggest that you do not rush it, let the gun settle down. Choose a pellet that it likes, fire atleast 200 shots through it and then scope it. It''ll be tamer by that time. If you rush it, it may damage your scope. I saw a Bushnell 3-9x56E scope here in Karachi, he was selling it for 8000/-. I may sell my Optima scope "IF" the Leapers scope that I''ve ordered arrives.

(439686, ' This one is for you Ustaad Jee (Turumti) :) I have huge respect for you and value your comments more than any as your experience far surpasses that of mine. Despite seeing several air gun hunting videos (esp that of feral pigs and boars) and PG members'' experience, your comment did make me wonder if I''ve made any tall claims about the possible performance of this gun (and modern high powered air guns). You know well I''m a humble man (at least that''s what I think ;)) and shy away from making claims that aren''t practically achievable. So I conducted this test today. I got myself 3 pieces of wood, 3/4 of an Inch thick (0.75 inch) and decided to shoot at least 1 pellet through each to judge its penetration at approx 10 yards. If the pellet goes through, then we can safely assume that this air gun has enough power to cause serious damage at short distance. How the results came out was enough to convince me firmly that this air gun is serious business. I''ll in fact be EXTRA careful while operating this gun and this is the same advise i''ll give to EVERY ONE who buys this or any variable of this gun. Though we all should be very careful when dealing with air guns but this gun has all the potential to cause SERIOUS injuries and SHOULD be handled with EXTRA CARE.\r\n\r\nWhen i shot the 1st pellet at the wooden piece, it didn''t move although i was certain that I didn''t miss. Upon inspection i discovered that the pellet went completely through and hit the wall behind it, and made a considerable dent in the wall :p so I decided to place the rest of wooden pieces against that laminated board on which I''ve been practicing. The images will speak for themselves. Note that I''ve marked the wood for a reference point for where to aim, I wasn''t particular about hitting dead center here :p.', ''),

Injuring animals for "fun" and causing them unnecessary suffering is not becoming of anyone aspiring to be a sportsman.[/QUOTE]\n\nI totally agree, the .22LR completely penetrated the phone book but there was 1 big difference! you used an RWS .22 subsonic ammo which generally travels between 1000 and 1080 fps  and weighs 40 grains (a whopping 94.25 FPE at muzzle keeping an average velocity of 1030 fps), I used Gamo pro magnum which is approx 15.6 grains and may have traveled roughly around 925 fps (29.65 FPE at muzzle) at best. So the .22LR was >3 times powerful than the air gun :).\n\nHowever on a personal note, I do not see myself attempting to hunt a wild boar with an airgun (not on my own at least) as i surely wouldn''t want one of them "love bites" :p the habitat and game behavior in Sindh does not permit a hunetr that liberty. Things may be different in Islamabad and some areas of Punjab where these pests are often quite indifferent to people and passing by vehicles etc, hence providing a possible opportunity of a carefully placed, successful close ranged shot. \n\nHowever, I strongly second your point that more likely than not, even a SLIGHT deviation in the shot will result in an injury rather than fatality causing the animal a lot of pain and suffering. It may eventually die but not a clean death.', ''),

(439807, ' I am quoting what i consider to be a brilliant piece of writing and a guideline for all sports hunter. Came across it while reading through proper shot placement on hogs:\r\n\r\n"The neck shot requires a proper angle and a steady rest, however.  It’s still close to the head, so if you’re not stable enough you risk hitting the jaw or nose.  The solution is simple.  [B]Don’t take the shot[/B].\r\n\r\n[B]And that’s the bottom line any time.  If you’re not comfortable that you can put the shot right where you want it, then don’t shoot.  It’s a discipline that any hunter should master, but far too few have bothered to do so.  As a result, you see bad shots taken in haste or out of desperation.  Something I absolutely hate to hear from any hunter is, “It was the only shot I had, so I had to take it!”[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]A sport hunter never has to take a shot… never!  The simple fact is that none of us is going to starve if we let the animal get away. \r\n[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]We are not out there because we have to be, we are out there for sport, and it is only ethical and right that we do the best we can to make the death of any game animal as clean and humane as possible[/B] "', ''),

This PCP air rifle comes with a fiber optic front and rear sight. For even more precision out of this accurate pellet rifle, mount a scope on the 11mm dovetail. \nThe 300 bar (4350 psi) air reservoir delivers 100 shots at 40 joules (29.5 ft-lbs). There''s a built-in gauge on the end of the reservoir. The Dominator''s fiberglass-reinforced synthetic stock has a Monte Carlo design with cheekpieces on both sides for both right- and left-handed shooters.

The Dominator rifle comes in a foam lined hard shell case and is available in a .177, .22, or .25 caliber version. The .177 and .22 are available with a scope and bipod.\n\n[/B]', ''),

Ok about the second issue...The law clearly says "gun tempering is a seriously illegal", just like you cant temper a chasis number on ur vehicle..Well to be sure and have a peace of mind, dont buy anything yet and just get ur licence checked from MOI (computerized licence means = it must be having a record with MOI and Nadra) if nadra give you a stupid answer, Check MOI, They definately will check the record for you. My younger brother once just went straight to MOI with a photocopy of his book licence and got it checked from MOI and didnt have any issue thats about a year back. So first step "check its authenticity" if its fine and authentic, Next step , if you go all the way to Moi simply also ask them about the weapon changing procedure on the card licence.

Running into a building full of bad guys will, realistically, only result in two officers in a bad situation.\n\n Your oath requires you to defend the public.  You go to the store.  I''ve been accused of oversimplifying things, but one reason I feel so strongly about this particular scenario is that it shows the difference between a policeman - a man sworn to uphold the law and defend the public - versus a gang with badges.  The gang will protect their own, at the expense of the public.  If you go to your partner at the expense of innocents, you just took a steaming dump on your badge, which you don''t deserve to carry. \n\n Sometimes moral questions are hard.  I don''t see any difficulty here.  You took the oath, you took the money, you took the badge.  Now do your job.\n\n\n The name of the movie was "I Come In Peace",  with Dolph Lundgren, from 1990.

The weapons made in POF are not of American design even. Also, POF only makes ONE pistol, the PK-9, which is a Beretta Clone. The 92 FS costs around 550-600 dollars in America, which is not 10 times the price of PK-9. It is the ridiculous import laws and unreasonable profit margins charged by dealers that force the prices of such guns to go so high.\r\nAnother thing bro, you are just confusing iffi bro, that too with wrong information. \r\n\r\n@iffi bro, please increase your budget a few thousands and you will have many chinese options to chose from, there is CF-98, NP-22 in 9mm which should be around your budget. Also if you do decide to increase your budget, please look into Turkish Canik handguns as well. If you cannot increase the budget, then go for a chinese 30, that should be around 20-24 thousand, and you can buy ammo with the rest of the money.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

It is a piston driven AR-15 which is better than any Direct gas impingement gun out there whether american or non american. The fit and finish is also at par with any american AR. The only reason I would chose a Bushmaster over an MK3 is because a bushmaster will accept all types of accessories from american companies and it is better in quality compared to the norinco. The MK3 uses its own barrel nut and gas system and bolt hence those things are non interchangeable also lack of extra barrels in Pakistan would push me off the MK3.

I DONT care about any of them even the least bit, MAINLY because I have a LOT in my life going on and am MORE than happy with it; In fact i dont ask Allah to give me anything anymore.. He has given me everything that i can possibly need.. (read this as 500 chinese and 2000 local brand ammo FREE of cost every month).

IT all just made everything clear to me in all the confusing things that i was patiently handling. However I still miss some discussion over there as I have completed the detailed testing of ammo and wanted to post it there. All the pros and cons of local ammo is tested and soon i will take photos and post it here.\n\nBTW: have you thought about all the other forums?? cauz research has led me to a forum where all the possible questions are already answered.

Secondly ... just the presence of Skeeter sb here more often makes this place well above any other place that can possibly be.\n\nAnyways i find this forum a lot better then TGF; and i think that incident was bound to happen and make me come here and post here only. I have been practicing a LOT with the local ammo lately at a private farm house of a friend and many of the people around me get the same benefit of free shooting casually if the ammo i am given is in excess to my shooting mood.

With several variations of the RSA in the market today, GLOCK&#8217;s goal with this voluntary exchange is to standardize the RSA to gain the best possible performance in each pistol.\n\nGLOCK&#8217;s product development team has modified various elements of the RSA. The new RSA compensates for all design modifications made to the Gen4 and allows the pistols to function up to GLOCK&#8217;s rigid quality standards and reliability goals.\n\nConsumers should note that Gen4 G26 and G27 models will not require a modified recoil spring.\n\n&#8220;We are moving proactively and quickly to standardize this part of the pistol.

I am from Lahore and have a deep passion for hunting.  Currently i am on Baikal MP 153. Last season was, technically, my first for duck hunting. I have had some problems, some very close encounters but have not been very "prolific", to say the least. We''ve seen ducks flying around, close to our hide but almost never in firing range. I suspect there are areas for improvement in camo, calling and even location. I request senior member/veteran duck hunters to please contact me so that i can discuss the issues at length, exchange notes and prepare myself for the up coming season. my email is [EMAIL="farband@hotmail.com"]farband@hotmail.com[/EMAIL]. Laino, Avais, Tanveer and all other friends, i would love to have a passionate discussion on duck hunting over a cup of coffee. Please drop me a line on my email and we can take it up from there. \n\nI shall be really grateful\n\nThanks\n\nMustafa[/QUOTE]\n\n\nWelcome to Pakguns Mustafa Shah bro. Thanks for joining the forum. Yes you are right duck hunting depends on lots of things specially LOCATION, making a better hideout and wearing the proper camo clothing is also a part of duck hunting. Duck hunting is always a team work. You should also have resources to get informed about the duck positions on different area''s so you can determine the right time for duck hunting. I will suggest you to go though the hunting section for more information. All members and hunters including me are here to help you in any matter you want. \n\nhopefully upcoming hunting season will be fruitful for you.', ''),

The problem is that birds land in front of other hide outs, to our left and right, but not on our hide out. We use either 4 or 6 cartridge for ducks and keep BB for Geese (although have never encountered them :)). We make the hide out using the weed from the river sand belt. We use duck decoys, FUDs and Goose decoys. I would need help on identifying chokes as well for Baikal MP 153. What to read on the choke and which one to use for ducks and for Geese.

I am from Lahore and have a deep passion for hunting.  Currently i am on Baikal MP 153. Last season was, technically, my first for duck hunting. I have had some problems, some very close encounters but have not been very "prolific", to say the least. We''ve seen ducks flying around, close to our hide but almost never in firing range. I suspect there are areas for improvement in camo, calling and even location. I request senior member/veteran duck hunters to please contact me so that i can discuss the issues at length, exchange notes and prepare myself for the up coming season. my email is [EMAIL="farband@hotmail.com"]farband@hotmail.com[/EMAIL]. Laino, Avais, Tanveer and all other friends, i would love to have a passionate discussion on duck hunting over a cup of coffee. Please drop me a line on my email and we can take it up from there. \n\nI shall be really grateful\n\nThanks\n\nMustafa[/QUOTE]\n\nWelcome to Pakguns bro. Sounds like you''re not either wearing a proper cammo thus being spotted by the ducks or not calling properly.

The second is Taurus PT92/99 series(I think there are a few more too; PT917 and PT909), which is a really good option in Pakistan with respect to pricing.\n\n@ARU, bro you can also look into the PT917/909, if you''re considering a stoeger, as they are almost the same size.\n\nRegards.[/QUOTE]\n\nI can compromise on cocked and locked... The CF98 has a control lever that both decocks and acts as manual safety but it cannot be carried cocked and locked. The Taurus 809 series has that option..

(440936, 'Peltor Electronic  Ear Muffs - A Range Report I never bothered to use any ear/hearing protection at range neither at skeet nor at pistol/rifle even had long .357mag session without caring much about my hearing, although got whistling ears many times but I always thought shooting with bare ears is a manly affair ;) then one day brother Avais got ear muffs and it was pain in the neck to communicate with him with muffs on ;) so decided to give electronic muffs a try myself.\n\n  Last week received "3M Peltor Tactical 6 Stereo " Electonic Muffs from Cabelas and tried these at range yesterday (at both skeet & pistol range). \n\n\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/peltor1.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/peltor2.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/peltor3.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  [IMG]http://i577.photobucket.com/albums/ss220/denovo87/peltor4.jpg[/IMG]\n   \n  \n\n\n\nThese muffs worked excellently as these are advertised, they actually protect ears from any noise louder than a certain decibel (db level considered dangerous for hearing dont remember the exact number)  by depressing the sound to below damaging db level.\n  Shotgun n pistol sound was like a sweet thumping sound but I still could hear everything talking, chirping, singing even walking towards me while these muffs were on.\n  The most noticeable thing was the increased level of concentration on grip, trigger, sights n target; believe me I never shot 108 pistol rounds n about 10 shotgun shells with that concentration and accuracy like I did with these muffs. I will request to Avais bro to please post the picture of shoot n see target I shot yesterday .\n   \n  I will strongly recommend to my fellow shooters who are of the view I used to be of ( manly affair ;) ) to give these muffs a try not only to protect your hearing but to achieve a considerable improvement in accuracy at rang.', ''),

That goes as\n"Persian is sweet and easy ( to learn )\n                      Turkish is no less than an art ( if u try to learn )\n                      Arabic is the language of God so I wont comment due to its reverence and respect"   \n  .   and the second proverb means &#8220; the language of my beloved is Turkish and I don&#8217;t understand Turkish"\n   \n  Actually , after the fall of the Otomanian empire and ascend of secular forces under the leadership of Kamal Pasah Atta Turk, the roman alphabet was adopted for the Turkish and this decision had its own merits and demerits . The biggest demerit , as considered by the historians and re-searchers is that the arrangements for proper translation of books were not made except very few chosen books, with the result that  the ship loads of books of immense value in their respective fields, spread all over Old Turkish Empire and all Islamic World in general became obsolete and very few people now know the old Turkish , so if these words are written in Turkish , we have a very little chance to know the meaning', ''),

NP 17s are pretty rare and if you look around long enough u just might be able to find a used one for around 25k. Chinese TTs both 636 as well as 54 are available around 20k (HM Traders Lucky star without negotiation) If U look around u might be able to find a used one for around 14-15k.. Megar armoury at lucky star had a display piece Chinese TT he was willing to let go at around 15k. \n\nIf TTs are not your thing then in this price range u can go for a local berreta 92 fs clone. The Khyber arms clone as well as moonstar arms and sherpao arms are around the same price range 18 to 20k max and are availabe at virtually all the dealers. Moonstar have their factory outlet at lucky star by the same name while Khyber arms distributors in Karachi are ammar and company also at lucky star. \n\nHowever, if local clones are not your cup of tea then u wil have to increase your budget a bit for a CF 98.

It also comes equipped with 3 different hand grips to cater to all hand sizes. Not to mention a magazine loader free of cost to make loading easy.

Also, "straight eight" style sights also work very well with poor eyesight.[/QUOTE]\n\nInterestingly the straight eight is also attractive to me. Or the ones which have a huge front sight dot to be aligned over a v cut rear sight with a vertical line. I am more concerned with getting a fast consistent sight picture in SD scenarios. The stock Glock sights are quite ok in that regard, but not perfect. I am also sort of cross eye dominant, so I have to wink to align the sight picture with my right eye. I guess a red dot optic would work fine, but there are not many holsters to fit that and concealment of a G 17 would get even more challenging.

PG members specially Raja Yasir, Chaudary, Jogee, Imdad Ali, and Sohaib Hassan Helped me alot in my wonderful purchase.I really appreciate your help brothers. Thanks alot.\nWell I went to my village on Saturday and on Sunday early morning me and my brother (Sohaib Hassan) went to test the gun for the first time. Our real aim in the morning was to check the the range of the gun and the impact of pellets on wall. Well we both were quiet amazed by the performance of the gun. The maximum range we shooted at was 80 Yards and the impact was amazing. We did put on the scope and tried to zero it but no success actually we were using the scope for the first time. The pellets was hitting away from the target while the scope was on. I am going to put pictures of the gun and of our experience with the beauty and give a detailed review of the gun.\n[B]\nSHOCK ABSORBING SYSTEM (SAS):[/B]\n The Rod of the Shock absorbing System is very thick surely it will increase the life of the parts of the gun. This rod also prevents the damage of optics as said by the company. Due to this system I think the gun is very accurate even though it got a great recoil.\n\n[B]QUATTRO TRIGGER:[/B]\n  I really like the trigger of the gun its very comfortable for me. I am really satisfied with the orginal setting of the trigger but it can also be adjusted easily if you want to.\n[B]\n GUN BLUING: \n [/B]This is the only part from which I am not satisfied but who cares this doesn''t affect the performance factor. Although I think that the company should think about this factor of the gun. :P \n\n[B]ACCESSORIES WITH THE GUN:[/B] \n I got a 3-9X44E optima scope which turned out to be a good one. The second most important thing with the airgun is the sling as the gun has got some weight on it. A bipod which is not really useful. And stock spacers which I even didn''t bothered to touch.\n\nThanks again dear members for helping me. :)', ''),

PG members specially Raja Yasir, Chaudary, Jogee, Imdad Ali, and Sohaib Hassan Helped me alot in my wonderful purchase.I really appreciate your help brothers. Thanks alot.\r\nWell I went to my village on Saturday and on Sunday early morning me and my brother (Sohaib Hassan) went to test the gun for the first time. Our real aim in the morning was to check the the range of the gun and the impact of pellets on wall. Well we both were quiet amazed by the performance of the gun. The maximum range we shooted at was 80 Yards and the impact was amazing. We did put on the scope and tried to zero it but no success actually we were using the scope for the first time. The pellets was hitting away from the target while the scope was on. I am going to put pictures of the gun and of our experience with the beauty and give a detailed review of the gun.\r\n[B]\r\nSHOCK ABSORBING SYSTEM (SAS):[/B]\r\n The Rod of the Shock absorbing System is very thick surely it will increase the life of the parts of the gun. This rod also prevents the damage of optics as said by the company. Due to this system I think the gun is very accurate even though it got a great recoil.\r\n\r\n[B]QUATTRO TRIGGER:[/B]\r\n  I really like the trigger of the gun its very comfortable for me. I am really satisfied with the orginal setting of the trigger but it can also be adjusted easily if you want to.\r\n[B]\r\n GUN BLUING: \r\n [/B]This is the only part from which I am not satisfied but who cares this doesn''t affect the performance factor. Although I think that the company should think about this factor of the gun. :P \r\n\r\n[B]ACCESSORIES WITH THE GUN:[/B] \r\n I got a 3-9X44E optima scope which turned out to be a good one. The second most important thing with the airgun is the sling as the gun has got some weight on it. A bipod which is not really useful. And stock spacers which I even didn''t bothered to touch.\r\n\r\nThanks again dear members for helping me. :)[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nBrother Shahab Kiani congratulations for buying a nice looking gun. If you are in or near Lahore then I can help you to set your scope. It is very easy to do zero. I have two air guns one is diana and the other one is Bsa purchased long time ago. Now few months ago I have fixed scopes on both of them. I also fixed scope on my .22 long BSA gun. All are perfectly zeroed.\r\nI was very much disappointed when a famous gunsmith in nila gumbad Lahore zeroed my 8mm gun. It was rubbish not a single shot was on target.

(441374, ' Thanks for your comments brothers ... !\n\nI agree with Ameer Sb, ... as the organizer of these hunts I really feel sad when my hunters shoot piglets or females .. Although, before every hunt we always discuss the whole hunting plan with our clients who are all experienced ethical hunters, explain them all the details, show them the routes followed by the pigs during each beat and take all safety measures etc ... YET ... despite all such measures they do sometime shoot the piglets & the females erroneously ... for which they always feel sorry ... and we regret their inadvertent act. But the true fact may be noted ... that when the beat starts and the boars come running "SO FAST" towards you in big herds ... amidst thick forest & bush with so little time (sometimes seconds) at your hand ... it becomes very difficult to differentiate between the males & the females or recognize the juveniles ... so mishaps like these do happen but the good thing is that the percentage of such mishaps is very very small and never exceed over a handful of unwanted slaughters.\n\nOn the other hand, our beaters who are mostly local farmers think so differently from ethical hunters like us ... For them, it does not matter if its a male or a piglet because they consider it a pest and harmful for their crop and they won''t spare it if they ever get a chance. Since its quite a laborious job to eradicate boars with their own limited resources, they make the best use of these paid beats with foreign hunters and don''t spare the piglets & the females. \n\nHaving said all this, it may not be out of place to mention here that under the prevailing conditions in Pakistan, the wild boar is indeed a pest and it''s population is too much and our handful of hunters who shoot altogether 50 to 100 boars (average) in the whole season can''t actually cause an irreparable damage to this animal. Thanks for listening. Your comments are welcome. Kind regards.\n\nPS : Ajmal Virk Sb, Yes Sir .. we procure temporary gun permits for our foreign hunters from Ministry of Interior so most of our hunters bring their own weapons which they can carry & use in Pakistan but only under our auspices since we are their guarantors.', ''),

Like Evanix don''t produce sub 12fpe so it effect on the demand in UK market (common users in UK). On the other side in USA there are many other reputed brands also available around same price ranges so in that way who cares about Korean Made PCPs etc. \n\nBTW: I am also having a concern about its Evanix PCPs accuracy reliability as there are non-regulated guns and if you closely watch videos review of Evanix AirRifles by PyramidAir you will notice higher extreme spread values which varies from 50 - 99 fps (depending on pellets weight) but this extreme spread is at higher level therefore putting a doubt on their accuracy reliability.

(441772, ' [COLOR=#61482A][FONT=Lucida Grande][FONT=arial]Hi,\r\n\r\nI come back to my old post. Finally I got the gun, I purchased it one week ago. It''s the IZH-27-EM-1C with the nickel receiver, 12gauge. The action was stiff as expected altough everything worked fine. I used the dummy shells to test the ejectors, both were OK. However, the sand and debris were almost anywhere, on the ejectors sears, in the forend, I was even able to "hear" the presence of the sand in the trigger spring when I was pulling the trigger very slowly.\r\n\r\nSo after getting back home, I disassembled the gun completely, well, except for the cocking cams and disconnectors located in the frontal part of receiver, because of the pin holding the cams - it''s nicely finished so I didn''t want to mar it. \r\n\r\nEVERY part has been cleaned, polished and lubed. Needless to say that there was a lot of orange-ish sand in the receiver, and metallic shavings, too. I also tried to wipe out the yellow sand located in the mid gap between the barrels. However, this task was more complicated than I thougt. I sprayed progressively the whole pint (!) of WD oil in the gap. A big portion of the sand came out, however, I can still see some grains coming out here and there. BTW, while applying the WD, I put a piece of cotton wool in the gap and now I am unable to get it out... I am wondering if it can harm anything?\r\n\r\nIt took me one week to re-assemble the gun, as I could only work in the evenings.\r\n\r\nAfter re-assembling it, I could see a little improving as for the opening/closing. However, it was far from Beretta [IMG]http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif[/IMG] So I cut the ejector springs which helped a little but not as much as I expected. \r\n\r\nI have also put a little vaseline on the hammer springs as I read somewhere here that it helps to reduce the friction which occurs when the springs are compressed. However I only put a little of it as I know too much vaseline can cause troubles. But it didn''t help much either...\r\n\r\nFinally I installed the tru-glo front bead and took the gun to the range. (BTW did I say you how difficult it was to unscrew the original beads?)\r\n\r\nI put some 240 shots through my IZH. I tried to shoot quite quickly as I wanted the barrels and the action to become hot so the possible problems would show up. \r\n\r\nIndeed, two of them occured: \r\n1. the top lever jams. Not always, only sometimes. Let''s say one time out of fifteen. This happens even if the chambers are empty. I am unable to move the lever from his center position to the right and I have to put a lot of effort to finally move it. So I guess waiting 20 seconds to open the action would''t help as this happens even without the shells loaded. I think the problem is somehow related with the contact of the locking bolt and the barrels, inside the receiver. \r\n\r\n2. Sometimes, the right ejector doesn''t eject fully the shell . The shell just stops halfway out. It is not exactly extracted, but it''s not ejected either. This happened 6-7 times out of 240 shots. I guess the ejector spring is too short, I took 8 coils. Not a big deal, I will order some new and will took less coils. I also observed that this problem dissappeared when I changed the ammunition.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I am proud to say there was not a single double shot. The IZH worked flawlessly. Except for the problem I described above, ejectors were perfect, no live shell ejecting. I also switched the barrel sequence to see if the ejectors would be OK this way, and they were. (BTW, did you know that to cancel the sequence when the top barrel is selected as first, there is no need to open the action? Just move the top lever to the right until you hear a gentle click, and there you go, the sequence is cancelled and the under barrel is selected as the first one again).\r\n\r\nAs for the performance, I am quite impressed. Of course, I am a rookie and maybe a pro would laugh on my poor russkoye gun, but still, it broke clays easily and if some didn''t broke, it was the shooter''s mistake, not the gun''s. Looks like a performer!\r\n\r\nHowever, I was a little bit disappointed when trying the slugs. I shot a couple of slugs to check if the barrels are correctly aligned. I have to say that there was a vertical difference of 15 inches in the point of impact between two slugs fired respectively from the under and the top barrel. The range to target was 37 yards. Horizontally, the impacts were aligned. But obviously the top barrel shoots higher than the under barrel. I don''t know, maybe it''s supposed to be this way and maybe it was my fault as I was pretty tired from shooting 230 rounds in 90 minutes [/FONT][IMG]http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif[/IMG] I also noted that the gun shoots a little bit to the left although I was aiming at the center of the target. I will have to re-check this.\r\n\r\nThe main surprise came when I got back home. I tried to clean the barrels but oh my! the bore is covered by some strange crusty stuff that I have never seen before. I was afraid the chrome finish was wearing out or whatever, but it looks like the slugs created a pretty stubborn layer of lead on the bore sides. Now I am unable to clean it, do you have any advice please?[/FONT][/COLOR]', ''),

(441830, ' [QUOTE=oziris;280034][COLOR=#61482A][FONT=Lucida Grande][FONT=arial]Hi,\n\nI come back to my old post. Finally I got the gun, I purchased it one week ago. It''s the IZH-27-EM-1C with the nickel receiver, 12gauge. The action was stiff as expected altough everything worked fine. I used the dummy shells to test the ejectors, both were OK. However, the sand and debris were almost anywhere, on the ejectors sears, in the forend, I was even able to "hear" the presence of the sand in the trigger spring when I was pulling the trigger very slowly.\n\nSo after getting back home, I disassembled the gun completely, well, except for the cocking cams and disconnectors located in the frontal part of receiver, because of the pin holding the cams - it''s nicely finished so I didn''t want to mar it. \n\nEVERY part has been cleaned, polished and lubed. Needless to say that there was a lot of orange-ish sand in the receiver, and metallic shavings, too. I also tried to wipe out the yellow sand located in the mid gap between the barrels. However, this task was more complicated than I thougt. I sprayed progressively the whole pint (!) of WD oil in the gap. A big portion of the sand came out, however, I can still see some grains coming out here and there. BTW, while applying the WD, I put a piece of cotton wool in the gap and now I am unable to get it out... I am wondering if it can harm anything?\n\nIt took me one week to re-assemble the gun, as I could only work in the evenings.\n\nAfter re-assembling it, I could see a little improving as for the opening/closing. However, it was far from Beretta [IMG]http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif[/IMG] So I cut the ejector springs which helped a little but not as much as I expected. \n\nI have also put a little vaseline on the hammer springs as I read somewhere here that it helps to reduce the friction which occurs when the springs are compressed. However I only put a little of it as I know too much vaseline can cause troubles. But it didn''t help much either...\n\nFinally I installed the tru-glo front bead and took the gun to the range. (BTW did I say you how difficult it was to unscrew the original beads?)\n\nI put some 240 shots through my IZH. I tried to shoot quite quickly as I wanted the barrels and the action to become hot so the possible problems would show up. \n\nIndeed, two of them occured: \n1. the top lever jams. Not always, only sometimes. Let''s say one time out of fifteen. This happens even if the chambers are empty. I am unable to move the lever from his center position to the right and I have to put a lot of effort to finally move it. So I guess waiting 20 seconds to open the action would''t help as this happens even without the shells loaded. I think the problem is somehow related with the contact of the locking bolt and the barrels, inside the receiver. \n\n2. Sometimes, the right ejector doesn''t eject fully the shell . The shell just stops halfway out. It is not exactly extracted, but it''s not ejected either. This happened 6-7 times out of 240 shots. I guess the ejector spring is too short, I took 8 coils. Not a big deal, I will order some new and will took less coils. I also observed that this problem dissappeared when I changed the ammunition.\n\nOtherwise I am proud to say there was not a single double shot. The IZH worked flawlessly. Except for the problem I described above, ejectors were perfect, no live shell ejecting. I also switched the barrel sequence to see if the ejectors would be OK this way, and they were. (BTW, did you know that to cancel the sequence when the top barrel is selected as first, there is no need to open the action?[/FONT][/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#ff0000][FONT=Lucida Grande][FONT=arial][B] Just move the top lever to the right until you hear a gentle click, and there you go, the sequence is cancelled and the under barrel is selected as the first one again).[/B][/FONT][/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#61482A][FONT=Lucida Grande][FONT=arial]\n\nAs for the performance, I am quite impressed. Of course, I am a rookie and maybe a pro would laugh on my poor russkoye gun, but still, it broke clays easily and if some didn''t broke, it was the shooter''s mistake, not the gun''s. Looks like a performer!\n\nHowever, I was a little bit disappointed when trying the slugs. I shot a couple of slugs to check if the barrels are correctly aligned. I have to say that there was a vertical difference of 15 inches in the point of impact between two slugs fired respectively from the under and the top barrel. The range to target was 37 yards. Horizontally, the impacts were aligned. But obviously the top barrel shoots higher than the under barrel. I don''t know, maybe it''s supposed to be this way and maybe it was my fault as I was pretty tired from shooting 230 rounds in 90 minutes [/FONT][IMG]http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif[/IMG] I also noted that the gun shoots a little bit to the left although I was aiming at the center of the target. I will have to re-check this.\n\nThe main surprise came when I got back home. I tried to clean the barrels but oh my! the bore is covered by some strange crusty stuff that I have never seen before. I was afraid the chrome finish was wearing out or whatever, but it looks like the slugs created a pretty stubborn layer of lead on the bore sides. Now I am unable to clean it, do you have any advice please?[/FONT][/COLOR][/QUOTE]\n\nSir, Refer to red lined quote, IMO the sequence of barrels of  IZH-27 could not be changed in the way you mentioned in your post. \nWith this gun you need to push the trigger forward for changing the sequence of barrels shots. and for reversing the sequence you have to open and close the gun.

They were equal to todays SSG in Pak Army or US seal team 6, with an addition  that their loyalties remained unconditionally with the sitting Ottomanian Sultan (emperor ). this elite unit of ottomanian army was formed by picking  the orphan children from across the ottomanian empire. they were raised under the direct supervision of sitting ottomanian king who visit their nurseries and training camp as an obligatory royal duty regularly to establish close affinity / relations with those orphan children who, after facing hardships of being orphan , see the king as their father and savior who redeem them from hardships of orphanity   and raise their social status to the members of most elite fighting  force of the time whose members were privileged with the direct subordination  of sultan/king . their curriculum also revolved around the personal faithfulness of king . they served the ottomainan empire vigorously for centuries . i wonder if this sword , if is really anatolian , belongs to some one in  [I][B][COLOR=#ff0000] yeniceri[/COLOR][/B][/I]', ''),

The gun is very powerful; at 70 yards, it hit with authority passing cleanly through the 0.25 inch laminated sheet.\r\n\r\nI''m posting the 2nd sheet, by this time my left hand was quite worked up :p there had been some early morning visitors (whom the cats are feasting on now) and I had a go at them as well ;) you''ll see a couple in the pics.\r\n\r\nAs Bro Raja Yasir suggested, the Gamo Pro Magnums were not accurate at 70 yards which was evident from the results of the 1st sheet (another thing to blame for haywire shots was nonavailability of a proper rest).

I wanted one like bbiillaall bro, but only 2 pieces were available in Lahore, one in Nela Gumbat at Mokal Arms and one at Chauhdary Arms. But both in black. After looking and holding the gun i said hey black isn''t so bad, actually it looked better. The shopkeeper was asking 70k for it but got it down to 60k. Which isn''t bad for this gun.

Around 1000+ grams as mentioned by the gun makers. The trigger is nice and light and breaks cleanly. The slide doesn''t move as smoothly as i thought but maybe it will smooth out after few hundred rounds. There is no rattle in the slide and the frame and slide fit is reasonably tight. Slide stop/release lever is hard at this time and would have been nice if it was bit beefier, i cant reach it easily and is bit stiff.\n [IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00590.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00591.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00572.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe grip safety nice and smooth but i like the Taurus''s more. In-fact i think this gun is not as well made as Taurus PT1911. But its cheaper and that''s what you have to compromise, Quality. I think its not bad for the price it comes in. If you can afford more or willing to pay 100k+ for a Taurus, then be my guest and go for it. But I''m not spending 100k''s on a Taurus. The mags are very well made and hold 8 rounds. Mec-Gar makes very good quality mags. I think Mag quality is better then Taurus''s.\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00597.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

Its good that you''ve decided to end your silence.\r\n\r\nBrother, the barrel should be absolutely dry before firing. When you shoot, for every bullet that you shoot there is a small explosion of gunpowder, this produces gases which push the bullet through the barrel. If you''ve ever noticed there is flash from the barrel which is the basically the explosion. If your barrel has oil in it, this explosion ignites the oil as well, which produces carbon particles, which keep on depositing inside the barrel and eventually can cause irrepairable  damage to the barrel.\r\n\r\nSo..... please tell all the people that have told you that the barrel should be oiled before shooting that they are wrong and should stop doing it AT ONCE.\r\n\r\nRegards.', ''),

I didn''t have any problems of any sort while my session of 100 rounds. Its fun to shoot and is very accurate. The felt recoil is very less and trigger is good. The sights are fixed and are complete black. Yes no three dot system, no straight eight, no white or any color marking, just plain black front and rear sights. But the air between the rear sight is very less and that takes away some margin of error. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00592.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00593.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe Things that i don''t like about this gun are the sights, They are fixed, and there is no option of changing them(i think). The barrel is very thin. I don''t know if all 1911 barrels are like this or this particular gun has a thin barrel. Maybe senior and experienced member like Denovo87, Avais, bbiillaall and Umer Butt who own a 1911 can comment on that.\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00584.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00581.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00586.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe slide release lever is hard and thin. The mag release button is also very stiff. But these things normally smooth out after a while. Don''t like the grips, Its made of plastic and are bit thicker for my hand. I definitely be changing them soon.\n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00589.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe extractor is unlike Taurus''s, and is inside the slide. I don''t know if its a good thing or bad. \n[IMG]http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k512/bilal_qureshi1/DSC00596.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAll in all its a good budget 1911 for the people who can''t afford a Dan Wesson or other quality 1911 and sensible enough not to pay a 100+ on a Taurus. If the the difference between Taurus and Zigana is less then 15k then Taurus is a better choice as it has more aftermarkets and looks better. But Zigana is bit more accurate. here are some pics of my first shots with Zigana M1911. \n\n[I][B]Shooting Zigana M1911:\n\n[/B][/I]First shot were test shot fired from 10M.

(442060, ' [QUOTE=oziris;280110]Sir, I don''t think I am smarter than you. At the beginning, I was thinking same as you -  to reset the firing sequence, a full opening and closing action would be necessary. However, what I did first afer buying the gun, was RTFM (read the f*****g manual). yes, so simple it was. I don''t know what kind of IZH version do you have, but as I wrote above, mine is an IZH-27-EM-1C. My manual says this: "In the IZH-27EM-1C, the barrels are fired in the sequence: the bottom barrel-the top barrel.  For changing the sequence of fire, pull the trigger forward until a click is heard and the barrels will be fired in the reverse sequence: the top barrel-the bottom barrel. [COLOR=#ff0000]To set the barrels to the initial sequence of fire, move the top lever[/COLOR]". So yeah, it works, at least for me. As soon as the lever is moved to the right and the safety is enagaged again, the firing sequence is reset. No need to open the action.[/QUOTE]\n+1 Bro.\nNever heard of this action before and always opening/closing the action in order to reset the sequence. \nglad to learn the new trick.\ntks', ''),

Just a thought with no practical experience. please elaborate if it is  because of reload time can''t we just load two cartridge in the gun or  fire at saner intervals.\n\nmy questions may be lame being a complete novice but pls help', ''),

I guess you are taking this discussion very "seriously". \nBy the passage of time you will surely learn that in our beautiful Pakistan hunting rules and regulations are written only in books. Nobody (me first) can claim the LEGAL HUNTING.  [B]Same like the common doves you killed are not LEGAL to hunt in Punjab, am i right?[/B] \nBrother as I said I do not want to indulge myself in this useless discussion due to certain reasons. \n\nPheasants:\nFor your kind info, there are Just TWO groups in your country who has the GUTS to hunt Monal. you  may know that the habitat of Monal is above tree line. One has to have very strong LUNGS to reach in Monal Bonanza where oxygen level is very very low. And strong LEGS are needed too, we are not claiming ourselves as Strong, actually we are climatized. \n[B]Wildlife of KPK issuing special pheasant permit for you kind info. (Only National Parks are Strictly Closed Area).[/B]\n\nMy Dear Brother Ch. Finally I hereby asking you for a favour, [U][B]please delete the name of the person not present in our this particular discussion. MOD are requested too. [/B][/U]\n\nthanks[/QUOTE]\nLittle brother Ashkaari,\nI never take online forum discussions seriously as there''s literally nothing to it.\nI totally know how it works in our country be it hunting rules or regulations or any other, but this forum is not the place for it. That doesn''t make you prone to the rules.\n\nBe kind enough to read the title "[U]Old[/U] Doves and Pigeons" \nLet common sense prevail - ''common doves'' or more appropriately "Collared doves" were not banned in Punjab since 1857... come on?\nYou mean those who shot Markhors with permits in 1990s were poaching as Markhor is now banned? Lolz????\n\nI am not a tad bit concerned how pheasants are shot, AND I''M SURE KPK Wildlife Deptt. is sensible enough not to offer [B]Female[/B] Monal and other rare breed permits.', ''),

If you are afraid that it may go off accidentally then either you are carrying it in wrong holster or the gun (including ammo) is not that reliable. Carrying a gun is not a simple matter it is a very very serious issue and takes a lot of responsibility and top of it all is you being in a condition where you can effectively take the gun out and shoot (read "drop dead") the BG before he gets a chance to even aim at you. ultimately if this level of effectiveness is to be achieved then the ONLY condition to carry would be where the gun is chambered and unlocked.\nThere is NO other option if you are serious about your and your families safety...[/quote]', ''),

Better still they could put this info on the Internet and then they would have even less of an opportunity to interact with customers.\n\nBut since they are in the habit of lying like for e.g., pretending to have a weapon in their store when they are actually fetching it from someone else and adding their own markup to the already marked up price, doing " mole tole" like sabzi mandi vendors and so on then they should learn to live with the fact that there will be need for conversation and interaction.', ''),

If you shoot the deer with the rifle and mention the name of      Allaah, and hit the deer, and it dies from that shot, then it is halaal and      it is permissible to eat it. If you catch up with it when it is still alive,      it is essential that you slaughter it properly. \r\n          Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was      asked: Are the birds that we shoot with rifles and they died halaal or not?      We find that some birds that we shoot have died before we can say the name      of Allaah over them. \r\n          He replied: \r\n          Yes, if you shoot a rifle when hunting birds or rabbits or      deer, and you say the name of Allaah when pulling the trigger, then it will      be halaal, even if you find it already dead, because the Prophet  (peace      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to      flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he      said: “If you release your (hunting) dog and mention the name of Allaah over      it, then eat.” But if it is still alive and able to move then you must      slaughter it properly and mention the name of Allaah over it when      slaughtering it. If you do not do that and it dies, then it becomes haraam      for you. But attention must be paid to mentioning the name of Allaah when      pulling the trigger, because if you do not mention the name of Allaah then      it is haraam to eat it, even if you forget, because the Prophet  (peace      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to      flow and the name of Allaah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he      said: “Do not eat of that over which the name of Allaah has not been      mentioned.” End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb. \r\n          Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is      it sufficient for me to say Bismillaah wa Allaahu akbar when inserting      bullets into the rifle when hunting, or must I mention the name of Allaah      when pulling the trigger of the rifle? \r\n          He replied:\r\n          What you must do is mention the name of Allaah when shooting,      and it is not sufficient to mention the name of Allaah when putting the      bullets into the rifle, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of      Allaah be upon him) said: “When you shoot your arrow, then mention the name      of Allaah” (saheeh – agreed upon, from the hadeeth of ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may      Allaah be pleased with him); this version was narrated by Muslim).

(443661, ' I had an opportunity to check out the TP-9 at a dealer over the weekend. I spent almost 45 minutes closely inspecting and dry firing it. Unfortunately, I couldn''t take any pictures as the dealer wouldn''t allow it. Note that the TP-9 is a Turkish-made clone of the famous Walther P99 AS. Anyway, the following are my impressions:-\n\n[B]SIGHTS:[/B]\nI actually loved the sights. Compared to the Piranha-F, the sights were a marked improvement; big, bold and highly visible "glow-in-the-dark" dots made sight alignment and target acquisition infinitely quicker, a BIG plus in a CC gun. I think having an adjustable rear sight on the TP-9 is somewhat of an overkill, but if the gun proves to be decently accurate at 25 meters and beyond (something I''d be amazed of, considering it sports a 4 inch barrel), then I guess the adjustable sights would definitely come in handy; for strictly CC/SD purposes, I think it''s unnecessary. But still, kudos to Canik55 for atleast providing us with options (even if a majority of us might not avail it).\n\n[B]BUILD QUALITY:[/B]\nJust like any other Canik55, the build quality was SUPERB! The slide-to-frame fitting was perfect with absolutely no rattling. I field striped the gun and found no factory marks or burrs anywhere, although there were a few nooks & crannies that could''ve used a bit more polish. The barrel locked in the slide perfectly, with no excess margin or space. Also, there was no flexing in the polymer at all. I removed the magazine and squeezed the grip with both hands as hard as I could, and the polymer remained rigid as steel. Lovely! After reading about the "bulging" issues of the CZ Duty and some people complaining of polymer flexing in Taurus pistols, I was somewhat sceptical regarding the polymer quality of the TP-9. I''m glad my scepticism was proved wrong; the construction is solid through & through.\n\n[B]ERGONOMICS:[/B]\nOk, this is where personal preference and our individual body builds will come into play. First off, let me start by saying that I have large, beefy hands. I personally hate the fact that, while handling Glocks (for example), I have to cant my wrists forward in order to line up the gun with the target. The grip angle of a LOT of polymer guns just doesn''t suit me (including Glocks, Styer M9 and the Caracal). That being said, I was pleasantly surprised just how comfortable the TP-9 felt in my hands. The grip angle is less extreme than the aforementioned brands and more along the lines of other traditional handguns. The default backstrap was small for me so I asked the dealer to swap it with the larger one that comes with the gun (more on accessories later). With the larger backstrap, the gun felt like a part of my hand. It felt VERY comfortable, sighting & aiming was easy (requiring no wrist canting or arm contortion) and the overall balance was spot on! Also, I loved how Canik55 stuck with the traditional magazine release button instead of adopting Walther''s method (which I personally dislike). The slide release, however, was a bit hard for me. But I guess this is something which might smooth out after the break in of the gun.\n\n[B]TRIGGER:[/B]\nHere''s the interesting part, the TP-9 works pretty much like a conventional DA/SA pistol (something which other striker-fired pistols don''t). In SA mode, the trigger has more take up than I''m happy with, but there''s no creep and the trigger breaks clean & crisp. The reset is almost instantaneous, allowing for quick follow up shots. In DA, there''s negligible take up and practically no creep, and the trigger pull is actually lower than the Piranha''s, allowing for a much smoother and faster initial shot. Also, unlike other polymer pistols with plastic triggers, the TP-9''s trigger doesn''t flex. I dry fired the gun PLENTY of times, and on no occasion did I feel any flexing; the trigger is solid and pulls beautifully.\n\n[B]SAFETIES:[/B]\nConventional striker-fired handguns, unlike hammer-fired pistols, feature practically no external safeties at all (other than the Safe-Action Trigger). The TP-9, on the other hand, doesn''t have the Safe-Action Trigger safety, and instead features an ambidextrous decocker (located along the upper edge of the slide, just ahead of the rear sights). To understand the function of the decocker, you must first remember that the TP-9 acts much like a traditional hammer pistol. In that respect, the TP-9''s decocker does exactly what a decocker in a hammer pistol would do; decock the firing mechanism. Once decocker, the TP-9 goes into DA mode; longer, heavier trigger pull which prevents any negligent discharge. Once the slide is racked (or a shot is fired), the TP-9 then goes into SA mode (just like conventional DA/SA pistols); shorter, lighter trigger pull. If the gun is in SA mode (i.e. the striker is cocked), a red coloured pin protrudes from the rear of the slide, just below the sights. It''s impossible to miss or ignore. Once the deocker is pressed, the striker is decocked and the red coloured pin goes back into the slide. This pin, and especially it''s location, is ideal for letting the gun operator know the current condition of the firing mechanism. The TP-9 also features a "loaded chamber" indicator on the upper part of the slide, just behind the ejection port. The TP-9 also features a firing-pin block. Also of note, there is NO external safety lever, so you can''t carry the TP-9 "cocked & locked".\n\nPersonally (and this is strictly my opinion), I don''t trust any gun with safeties I can''t manipulate or a firing mechanism (hammer or striker) which I can''t decock at will. That''s the reason why I''ve stayed away from polymer/striker handguns and put my faith in good ol'' fashioned steel & hammer. The TP-9, however, has gotten me quite interested because of it''s featured decocker, allowing me to carry the gun chambered without any worries of accidentally pulling a light trigger.\n\n[B]ACCESSORIES:[/B]\nThis is where the TP-9 truly shines. The gun comes packaged with 2 18-round magazines, a cleaning brush, an autoloader (which, for some reason, is missing in all the TP-9''s I''ve seen), 2 grip backstraps which you can swap to fit the gun perfectly in your hand (the backstrap is attached via a roll pin on the grip), a kydex holster with an index finger lock & retainer, and 2 base units to which the kydex holster can be attached to; a paddle unit and a belt unit, allowing you to carry the gun in either a paddle holster or a conventional holster tied to your belt. Just these accessories alone make the TP-9 a very delicious & tempting buy!\n\n[B]CONCLUSION:[/B]\nThe more I think about the TP-9, the more I''m tempted to buy it. Right now, I''d say I''m 85% sure I''m definitely getting a TP-9; the remaining 15% of my mind is still waiting for a range report to decide fully. But, all in all, the TP-9 appears to be an excellent gun for CC and with it''s accessories loadout, it''s next to impossible to find a gun which gives you so much value for money. If, like me, you''re a metal & hammer pistol guy and is looking for his first polymer/striker gun, then look no further; the Canik55 TP-9 is definitely the way to go!', ''),

(443681, ' [QUOTE=Ahnab;281920]I had an opportunity to check out the TP-9 at a dealer over the weekend. I spent almost 45 minutes closely inspecting and dry firing it. Unfortunately, I couldn''t take any pictures as the dealer wouldn''t allow it. Note that the TP-9 is a Turkish-made clone of the famous Walther P99 AS. Anyway, the following are my impressions:-\n\n\n[B]CONCLUSION:[/B]\nThe more I think about the TP-9, the more I''m tempted to buy it. Right now, I''d say I''m 85% sure I''m definitely getting a TP-9; the remaining 15% of my mind is still waiting for a range report to decide fully. [B]But, all in all, the TP-9 appears to be an excellent gun for CC and with it''s accessories loadout, it''s next to impossible to find a gun which gives you so much value for money[/B]. If, like me, you''re a metal & hammer pistol guy and is looking for his first polymer/striker gun, then look no further; the Canik55 TP-9 is definitely the way to go![/QUOTE]\n\nAhnab bro now that you have tried it at shop want to know your opinion on the DA trigger pull of the gun. What do you think is the weight of the pull? I agree with you on the package. But i disagree with you that its the best value for money. I think the best Value for money is Caracals. TP9 is at 65k while Caracals at 70k or less. Now that Caracal has opened a Service center in Pakistan the best value is a Caracal. What if you break something in your TP9 or any gun for that matter which is sold here, what would you do? Lest say if you break a extractor of your gun, how would you replace it and where would you find it. With Caracals it no problem now simply order a new one. That''s Value for money...', ''),

(443821, ' [B]Humorous Comparison of an AK47, an AR15 and a Mosin[/B]\n\nThere''s an ever present, unending debate over which is best, ARs or AKs, raging across the internet and in gun shops every day sending bile and bitter insults spewing both ways. This debate has turned fathers against sons, best friends against one another, and........well you get the point. The author is of the opinion that there are of course pros and cons to each family of rifle, and I refuse to engage in what is "best". As one who loves them all, especially the AK and AR series, I thought I''d pass on some of the knowledge I have gained over the years concerning these wildly different weapons. As a bonus, I''ll toss in my knowledge of another favorite family of weapons at the Bunker, just because they are very popular these days and I often ramble about them. So, here, for the aid of those hammering one another in the debate, is some unbiased, non-slanted, untainted raw knowledge about the AK, the AR, and the Mosin Nagant. \n\nStuff you know if you have an AK.\n	\nStuff you know if you have an AR\n	\nStuff you know if you have a Mosin Nagant\nIt works though you have never cleaned it. Ever. 	You have $9 per ounce special non-detergent synthetic teflon infused oil for cleaning. 	It was last cleaned in Berlin in 1945.\nYou are able to hit the broad side of a barn from inside. 	You are able to hit the broad side of a barn from 600m. 	You can hit the farm from two counties over.\nCheap mags are fun to buy. 	Cheap mags melt. 	What''s a mag?\nYour safety can be heard 300m away. 	You can silently flip off the safety with your finger on the trigger. 	What''s a safety?\nYour rifle comes with a cheap nylon sling. 	Your rifle has a 9 point stealth tactical suspension system. 	Your rifle has dog collars.\nYour bayonet makes a good wire cutter. 	Your bayonet is actually a pretty good steak knife. 	Your bayonet is longer than your leg.\nYou can put a .30" hole through 12" of oak, if you can hit it. 	You can put one hole in a paper target at 100m with 30 rounds. 	You can knock down everyone else''s target just from the shock wave of your bullet going downrange.\nWhen out of ammo, your rifle will nominally pass as a club. 	When out of ammo, your rifle makes a great whiffle bat. 	When out of ammo, your rifle makes a supreme war club, pike, boat oar, tent pole, or firewood.\nRecoil is manageable, even fun. 	What''s recoil? 	Recoil often used to relocate shoulders thrown out by the previous shot.\nYour sight adjustment goes to ''10'', and you''ve never bothered moving it. 	Your sight adjustment is incremented in fractions of minute of angle. 	Your sight adjustment goes to 12 miles and you''ve actually tried it.\nYour rifle can be used by any two bit nation''s most illiterate conscripts to fight elite forces worldwide. 	Your rifle is used by elite forces worldwide to fight two bit nations most illiterate conscripts. 	Your rifle has fought against itself and won every time.\nYour rifle won some revolutions. 	Your rifle won the cold war. 	Your rifle won a pole vault event.\nYou paid $350. 	You paid $900. 	You paid $59.95.\nYou buy cheap ammo by the case. 	You lovingly reload precision crafted rounds one by one. 	You dig your ammo out of a farmer''s field in Ukraine and it works just fine.\nYou can intimidate your foe with the bayonet mounted. 	Your foes laugh when you mount your bayonet. 	You can bayonet your foe on the other side of the river without leaving the comfort of your hole.\nService life, 50 years. 	Service life, 40 years. 	Service Life, 100 years.\nIts easier to buy a new rifle when you want to change cartridge sizes. 	You can change cartridge sizes with the push of a couple of pins and a new upper. 	You believe no real man would dare risk the ridicule of his friends by suggesting there is anything but 7.62x54r.\nYou can repair your rifle with a big hammer and a swift kick. 	You can repair your rifle by taking it to a certified gunsmith, it''s under warranty! 	If your rifle breaks, you buy a new one.\nYou consider it a badge of honor when you get your handguards to burst into flames. 	You consider it a badge of honor when you shoot a sub-MOA 5 shot group. 	You consider it a badge of honor when you cycle 5 rounds without the aid of a 2x4.\nAfter a long day at the range you relax by watching "Red Dawn." 	After a long day at the range you relax by watching "Blackhawk Down." 	After a long day at the range you relax by visiting the chiropractor. THEN you watch "Enemy at the Gates."\nAfter cleaning your rifle you have a strong urge for a stiff shot of Vodka. 	After cleaning your rifle you have a strong urge for hotdogs and Apple Pie. 	After cleaning your rifle you have a strong urge for shishkabob.\nYou can accessorize your rifle with a new muzzle brake or a nice stock set. 	Your rifle''s accessories are eight times more valuable than your rifle. 	Your rifle''s accessory is a small tin can with a funny lid, but its buried under an apartment building somewhere in Budapest.\nYour rifle''s finish is varnish and paint. 	Your rifle''s finish is Teflon and high tech polymers. 	Your rifle''s finish is low grade shellac, cosmoline and Olga''s toe nails.\nYour wife tolerates your autographed, framed picture of Mikhail Kalashnikov. 	Your wife tolerates your autographed, framed picture of Eugene Stoner. 	You''re not sure there WERE cameras to photograph Sergei Mosin.\nLate at night you sometimes have to fight the urge to hold your rifle over your head and shout "Wolverines!" 	Late at night you sometimes have to fight the urge to clear your house, slicing the pie from room to room. 	Late at night, you sometimes have to fight the urge to dig a fighting trench in the yard to sleep in.\n\nThere you have it. In the end, it is clear to any open minded inquirer that the Mosin Nagant is the most superior weapon of all time, but the AR and the AK come out as a draw when compared side by side. \n\n\n[url]http://www.mouseguns.com/compare.htm[/url]', ''),

(443885, 'Review: BSA Superten .22 PCP AirRifle Comes with a 200cc detachable bottle, takes 5-7 mins continuous to fill till 230 bar (max for the gun).\nShoots at 24 ft/lbs with 14.3gn pellets w/o silencer, and the same pellet at 16ft/lbs with silencer (as much as a NIB Gamo Shadow 1000, RWS 31/34)\nMax full power shots per fill are 70 with the silencer, around 50 w/o it.\nIt''s a heavy PCP, weighing in at around 8lbs, it''s as much as a Diana 350 magnum... but lighter than the Diana 54/56.\nAs far as accuracy is concerned, it''s one of the most accurate PCPs produced.\nThe stock has some nice features like the adjustable butt pad, checkering (this is the S10 mk3, checkering in the mk2 wasn''t so impressive - and the mk1''s stock was a plain wooden plank).. and there is a manual safety on the forearm.\nThe bolt is smooth.\nThe gun comes with a 10 round magazine..... and it''s such a pleasure shooting the gun that you don''t even realize how quick you eat ammo. \n24ft/lbs power is ample for long range shooting, and is the amount of power which the best magnum springers could only produce.\nWe tested it at 90 yards and it went pretty well.\nI assume this gun is good enough for as much as 120 yards on birds keeping in mind the hallmark accuracy and more-than-magnum springer-power.\nThe trigger on this gun is by far the best trigger I have tried on an air rifle. It''s a match grade one, and the pull is presumably below 1lbs.\nI''ll rate loudness at 4/5 without the silencer, and at 2/5 with silencer (keeping Diana 350 at 3/5, Airforce Condor at 5/5)\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten003.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten004.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten005.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten006.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten007.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten008.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/BSASuperten009.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe only range I have tested it on paper till now is 25yds @16ft/lbs, and am attaching the results below\n\nDefiant pellets - 14gn\n25 yds\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bhjh001.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAir Arms pellets - 16gn\n25 yds\n\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa002.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa003.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa001.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa004.jpg[/IMG]\n\nEncircled groups were the tightest (some here are with Defiants, some with AirArms)\n[IMG]http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb399/B77W/bsa005.jpg[/IMG]', ''),

(443937, ' CZ999 is a VERY VERY sturdy gun and I haven''t seen any gun that could beat it at this.. BUT the only thing against it not favoring you is that it is a full size gun. you are going to wear it in IWB holster. With the weight, size and height it has it is a very hard to conceal gun.\r\nStoeger is a full size yet a smaller gun relatively to CZ999, Rotary barrel doesn''t matter that much. I don''t like Stoeger ONLY because of the safety on the slide. It HURTS my hands a LOT when I have to rack the slide in fast action secondly the whole side has a cutaway and is slippery, used it at the range twice with sweaty hands and it was mighty difficult to rack it from any other place other than the serrations and on serration half of them are covered by the HUGE safety. it is on a heavier side, extremely sturdy but NOT as sturdy as CZ999. Same weight in a smaller package.\r\nIF it was me then at the price range of 55k NOTHING beats CZ999.\r\nhere i would ask sadatpk brother to give his input as he LOVES it more than any other gun and he has had pretty good results as it fits him perfectly.\r\n\r\nCZ from Czechoslovakia is a different matter altogether.. they are what defines what a GUN is; without going into the history, i assure you that if you go for the CZ75 family you will NEVER ever be disappointed from the quality, shooting ease, and the value it offers. IF you can then raise your eyes towards CZ75c (Compact) or cz75b(full size). If you intend to carry buy the CZ75c. IMHO there is no other gun that offers such extreme value for money as CZ family does.\r\n\r\nCZ75 Duty is a polymer framed wonderful gun, light to carry extremely reliable, accurate and excellent gun. for CC(conceal carry) it is also one of the top choices but will not beat cz75c.\r\n\r\nSo the list for you should be\r\n\r\n1)Cz75C\r\n2)Cz 75 Duty\r\n3)CZ999\r\n4)Stoeger.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in consideration..\r\nNP34 ... a chinese clone of SIG P228\r\nCanik 55 L120 (Clone of Cz75b) Alloy frame\r\nCanik 55 C100 (Clone of Cz75c) Alloy frame\r\n\r\nCanik is a NATO certified gun.. their certifications follow the strictest rules of EPVAT, in Turkish guns i would only recommend you to look into "Canik 55" family only rest are not as good as Canik though price is same.\r\n\r\nI own NP22 and have shot about 1200 rounds in a day.
