None of the two calibers in question sounds more than .45ACP and .357 Magnum. Sound is not an issue.\n\n  2. Lethal range ? Every firearm even a simple 9mm can be lethal in hundreds of yard, if fired at 45 degrees angle\n\n  3. It is almost written over every ammo box of .22LR "Lethal up to 1.5 miles". When such a potentially lethal round even at 1.5 miles I really dont see what is wrong with .222 & .223\n\nIt is requested to respected LRC members to put forward these thoughts in black and white either give individual requests/applications or a single one with signatures of every member to LRC administration.\n\nRegards'),

Thousands of people are reading this, we can''t joke around here. \n\n[/QUOTE]\nHi all, its a superb idea to come up with concrete suggestions for the streamlining of licensing process in Pakistan. We need to put our foot to the pedal and try to translate this brilliant idea by Mr. Abbas and the detailed suggestions by Survivalist into something concrete.  I have a few humble suggestions:\n\n1. That we use this forum to start an association much like the NRA in USA. \n2. All forum members could be given an option to join this PNGA (Pakistan National Guns Association) for a suggested fee amount of 1000 rupees a year. \n3. All Associations members will then be eligible to elect a board. \n4. Board members to be elected for the offices of Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Legal Adviser ,Public Relations, Media, Member Welfare. \n5.

There are two sling swivel studs on the rifle. One is at the left side of the stock right in its centre and the other is at the junction point where the handguard starts right under the front sight tip. The sling is in two pieces and I have no idea at all, which end goes where. (Will have to ask someone for help in installing it). Nowadays, Chinese copies of the Magpul two-point slings are available in the market and they can be installed on the Sporter. From &#8220;Shashka&#8221; and style point of view, it may seem like a good idea, however, being a very long rifle, there is no practicality in carrying it in the assault rifle style with one end of the strap over one shoulder and the other end slipping under the other armpit.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%209_zpsnffzdfc0.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%209_zpsnffzdfc0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\n[B][U]Trigger[/U][/B]\nIf the reader has had the opportunity of using a G3, he would get the idea that the trigger pull and feel of the Sporter is not much different than its parent rifle. Yes, it&#8217;s a combat trigger. To me, the first stage was almost NIL as the trigger traveled hardly for a millimetre. It was absolutely smooth without any halting or gluey like feeling. But then as soon as the trigger reached the sear, there was a minutely slight creep with a somewhat long travel and then it broke crisply. I also noticed that the trigger doesn&#8217;t need to be released all the way forward for it to reset and its likably short.\nAnyways, I have yet to minutely study the internals of the trigger mechanism but I can fairly say that some polishing here and there may make it much much better for precision target shooting. In short, on first try, the Sporter&#8217;s trigger felt awkward but the clean break was like a symphony. I am sure I will be able to make a better comparisons and respond to further questions once I have used it at the range.\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%205_zpsga3xsgps.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%205_zpsga3xsgps.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B][U]Iron Sights[/U][/B]\nThe front sights of the Sporter is hooded and the rear one is rotary dioptre. The front hooded sight appears to be nearly identical as the HK91. The rotary rear sight has 4 adjustments i.e. 100m ''V'' sight and then 200, 300 & 400m aperture sights. The rear sights are adjustable for windage and elevation. As most of the people in Pakistan have comparatively more frequent exposure to the AK type sights, it would require some getting used to the dioptre sights. I noticed that the V style 100 m notch has a very light coloured Grey finish and due to that it enhances the glare making it difficult for the shooter to focus on it properly. I plan to give it a dark black matte finish which will solve this issue. \n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%208_zpsyfns2ipq.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%208_zpsyfns2ipq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]'),

Due to this rail, now the users won’t have to put those claw like mounts on their rifles which in fact look quite awkward. The user can just install an optic or a holographic sight on the rifle without additional cost of the mount. This setup is surely more dependable than any other mount system which we see for the HKs. So with its Picatinny rail on the receiver, the Sporter can be equipped with a good quality optic and thus the true essence of long distance shooting can be enjoyed with it. About a year back, I got my hands on a Leupold Mark 4 M3-10X with elevation turrets calibrated specifically for 308 Calibre so I am all set to test the rifle’s precision with a sufficiently good quality optic. However, when installing the scope, I noticed that the rings that came with the optic were not high enough and the eye piece side of the scope was restricted by the iron sights. Now I am on a hunt for at-least 1.5 inch high rings for a 30 mm tube.\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%204_zpsyndattlb.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%204_zpsyndattlb.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n \n[B]Safety/Fire Select Lever[/B]\nThe safety lever is on the left side of the rifle and can be easily accessed with the thumb of the right hand while keep the palm and fingers on the pistol grip.

On the right side of the receiver, there is only an indicator which shows the status of the weapon i.e. whether it’s in safe or in fire mode. \n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2012_zpstp3cps4v.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2012_zpstp3cps4v.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%204_zpseqsupifn.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%204_zpseqsupifn.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n \n[B]\n\nMagazines[/B]\nThe quality of the two (5 Round) magazines that came with the rifle is just OK. I plan to get them re-blued after sometime as they have been heavily painted/coated. Like many other battle rifles, the magazines need to be inserted in the magwell and then seated with a firm slap to ensure it’s locked in its place. I noticed that inserting these mags in to the magwell is only possible with a more-than-firm slap underneath it. I am not sure if the usual 20 round G3 magazines will fit in the Sporter or not; as I have yet to test any. I sincerely hope that to make this rifle “completely civilian” in all respects, the POF would not have altered the magazine seating mechanism and the 20 round mag will fit in it. After inserting it with a slap, the magazine sits very tightly in its place and is barely distinguishable from the side with the magwell owing to its small size and capacity. The Sporter has two type of mechanisms for mag-release. One is the lever which is in its typical place like the AKs and the other is a push button (Like the ARs) and is on the right side of the receiver.\nAn interesting find was that the 5 round magazine actually accepts 6 rounds. lol.\n \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2014_zpsdwrvoswe.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2014_zpsdwrvoswe.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2015_zpstyil1unm.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2015_zpstyil1unm.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]\nCharging Handle[/B]\nTypical of the HK family, the Sporter has the same design and placement of the folding bolt charging handle just like its parent rifle which is located above the left hand side of the handguard. The thing I like the most about the HK charging handles is their non-reciprocating movement i.e. once cocked, the charging handle will not move (unlike the AK) and will remain stationary. Similar to the AR platform, this gives the shooter a sense of safety as no moving parts are open. The bolt charging handle locks back once the magazine goes empty. After feeding in a fresh mag, the charging handle can be pulled back to cock the rifle.\nThe folding non-reciprocating charging handle can be used to lock the bolt to the rear by lifting it up into a notch. So for loading the rifle, the user will have to pull back the folding charging handle with strength and then lock it at the back in the notch. With a firm slap from the palm heel, the bolt is released which ensures the feeding of the round in the chamber; this is certainly a fun and fulfilling way to charge a gun. I am afraid, some softies will have a hard time loading this beast. I am over 6 feet tall and for me reaching the charging handle while keeping the rifle shouldered was a serious task as it required complete extension of my left arm and shoulder to reach the handle.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%207_zpsid5k9xim.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%207_zpsid5k9xim.jpg[/IMG][/URL]'),

I read somewhere that one of the main reasons why this design has remained in service for all these years is that it delivers stunningly reliable functionality attributed to its rolling lock design, which keeps working even in the most opposing environments. Unlike some would expect; in the rolling lock delayed blowback system, there is neither a gas tube, nor a gas system and accordingly no piston, no operating rod etc.\n\n\n \n[B][U]Packaging:[/U][/B]\nThe packaging includes the rifle; 2 (5 round) magazines; a sling and a cleaning kit.  The gun is not packed in anything except a long polythene bag locally known as “Lifafa”. I strongly feel that POF being a very reputable local manufacturer in Pakistan and with such a hefty price tag on their civilian products could do much better than this polythene bag. It wouldn’t have cost that much if they had made cardboard boxes for their civilian products and delivered the rifle in a presentable manner. My rifle had to travel a great deal from the manufacturer to the seller and then to me. So I think that the scratches I found on the receiver, magwell and the pistol grip trigger pack area could have been avoided if it were packed in a somewhat safe cardboard box.\nThe good thing is that the internals as well as externals of the rifle and the magazines are heftily drenched in oil so there can’t be any possibility of rust anywhere.\n \n[B][U]Barrel[/U][/B]\nThe barrel is almost 20.5 inches, which is expected to ensure a complete powder burn and would theoretically reduce noise levels as well for the shooter. The barrel of the Sporter has 4 grooves with right hand twist and is chrome lined. To keep the rifle as Civilian/Hunting profiled as possible, POF has ensured that there is no threading on the barrel, so eventually no muzzle break/ flash hider etc can be installed on the barrel. A very dear friend of mine has suggested to get the barrel threaded and install an IGF 53 style flash hider. Well! All in good time. InshAllah.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%203_zpsahcog7sp.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%203_zpsahcog7sp.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[B][U]Stock, Pistol Grip and the front Handguard[/U][/B]\nThe stock of the Sporter is made of synthetic polymer material and is the typical classic HK91/G3 fixed stock design. The Pistol grip is also made of polymer with one screw on its right side. The pistol grip has a grove for the right hand thumb and also for the rest of the fingers. The front handguard is of the Wide Forearm style and it too is made out of polymer. Underneath the handguard, on both sides, there are channels where the legs of the Classic Army G3 style bipod gets seated when folded. I don’t have any complaints regarding the polymer furniture, rather I have to praise it for its good quality and near to perfect fit. As I have a tendency of frequently knocking my rifles here and there so it is a plus point to have these parts of the Sporter in polymer finish. Having said that, even if it were in wood, I would have made it as a standing protocol to play around with the finish from time to time; not something I am proud of.\nThe rifle shoulders nicely and I don’t have to densely press my cheek with the stock. Being a fixed stock, no adjustment can be made to the pull length or cheek height. Because of the stock being of a standard size, it is supposed to be a fit for most of the shooters. Let me add, that if needed, the Magpul PRS or HK PSG stocks can be installed on the rifle without any alteration.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%206_zpsljzlie7w.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%206_zpsljzlie7w.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2011_zps3d0fa5fm.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2011_zps3d0fa5fm.jpg[/IMG][/URL]');

The pistol grip and trigger pack is attached with the receiver through another pin which when removed, the trigger pack should be easily removed. After that once the muzzle end is raised, a slight backward jerk on the charging handle would send the bolt and bolt carrier group out the rear of the receiver. The field tripping of the Sporter is quite quick and simple.\n \nPictured below, the two pins above and behind the pistol grip and a single pin right above the magazine release lever need to be removed to disassemble the rifle.   \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2014_zps1hluu5cw.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2014_zps1hluu5cw.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]Fit, Appearance & Finesse[/B]\nThe fit between the metal parts and polymer (stock, front handguard and pistol grip) is very good. I didn&#8217;t observe any uneven gaps or flimsiness as far as the fit is concerned. However, and that&#8217;s a big HOWEVER, the finish of the Sporter is poor. Many would term it as crappy, yes you heard me right; it&#8217;s crappy. Let me explain it in detail; the surface finish of the metal is perfectly fine, no doubt about that. It looks quite obvious that for the workmanship on the metal parts, POF utilized the services of the best there is. But after that, it seems as if POF lost all interest in this project and they gave the Sporter to a roadside Truck-Art painter and asked him to paint it black with a 4 inch wide brush. It would have been OK if that Truck-Art painter had given it a coat or two at max, but it seems that the guy was adamant on giving it at-least a dozen coats. The paint is rough at places and can be scratched off even with a finger nail. Now to be honest, for me that&#8217;s not a big issue as I can play miracles with its finish. Fortunately, the people I know can beautify the Sporter in a way that even Daniel Defence will be head over heels to see it. (No I am not joking at all). But this good fortune is not enjoyed by many. So POF needs to keep this in consideration that their 308 Win Sporter is a civilian product and Finesse is an integral part of any merchandise intended for the general public i.e. gun enthusiasts.\nMy overall verdict about the fit is that the rifle is solid and a very tight gun, but a lot needs to be desired in Finesse department.\n \n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2013_zpss7jctlyz.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2013_zpss7jctlyz.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[B]Final Thoughts[/B]\nAlong with hunters, another breed of shooters who might want to get hold of the Sporter could be those who are kicking off with newly entering the sport of long distance shooting competitions. In many movies we have seen those long distance snipers equipped with HK91 based platform rifles so with a proven record of accuracy and reliability, Sporter is also expected to do good for these shooters.\n\n[URL="http://s1341.photobucket.com/user/Jibz77/media/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2016_zpsvdprmakq.jpg.html"][IMG]http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o744/Jibz77/308%20Win%20Sporter/Sporter%20Review%2016_zpsvdprmakq.jpg[/IMG][/URL]'),

While I am sure not long ago begining of 2015 Fakhre Alam quoted me around 55K.\n\nHe also offered me the ATA Wood for 68k, Snake Colour 65K, Army/Camo 62K. But I dont want the ATA.\n\n2.

When 2 days later rang a different dealer he had them for 2K each. \n\nBudget is not an issue at all, the only reason I preferred to go for MP153 is simply to start the game as a beginner, get a bit of practice first and then in sha Allah take it from there on wards.'),

Allow automatics and rifle calibres like the 3o3 and ban the RPG''s and AP-9''s that these same big wigs give to their security details.\n\n\nI dont care if I am banned after this as hey I was invited to share a piece of my mind about this :p'),

Fake licenses due to inefficient data entry, storage and retrieval systems.\n2.    No mandatory pre-issuance SoPs or ID cross check. \n3.    Untraceable fired bullets until firearm is captured, as there is no record of licensed firearm bullet and spent cartridge marks. \n4.    Firearm Smuggling (buyers willing to pay high prices for firearms not available)\n5.    Fake firearm copies made locally for hunting/ sport purposes.) \n6.    Tax evasion, as firearm sold for a million rupee is recorded as 20,000 only.\n7.    No checks on how (through what means) foreign made firearms  imported/purchased and no track record of change of ownership.\n8.    Illegal Import & Trade, through changing of papers, records and paying bribe at every stage.\n9.    Current law and policy has grey areas, gaps and implementation issues, such as maximum allowed caliber for handguns is 44 inch, it is larger than the diameter of largest gun/tank on earth. It should be 44 Bore instead. Policy makers do not understand difference between bore, its equivalent in mm and differences. Similarly .22 caliber is a group of calibers that includes smallest (.22 short and long rifle bullet) to .223 (a larger bullet for hunting and 5.56 for military use as well) as well.\n10.    Incapacity and capability (in "arms branches" at DCO offices) of keeping and maintaining record, reviewing applications and examining eligibility of applicant for license of firearm. This leads to backdoors and corruption. One can obtain an arms license much easier than a driving license.\n11.    Situation is better at record keeping and issuing licenses after involvement of NADRA but authorization process is still doubtful.\n12.    Firearm regulations do not include written specifications for the lawful safe storage of private firearms and ammunition by licensed gun owners as part of the licensing process. T\n\n\nFirearms Policy Reforms and Recommendations\n\n1.    A provincial board/independent oganization with district level presence should be established to develop firearm licensing and control policy, strategy and guidelines and implementation thereof. \n\n2.    Board /organization to have representation from armed forces (firearm and shooting sports experts), NADRA, PITB, civil society, hunting community, shooting sportsmen, businessmen and firing range handlers.\n\n3.    A stringent criteria / procedure  be introduced for issuing arms licenses;\na.    Applicant should be examined psychologically.\nb.    Character certificate and police report should be made mandatory.\nc.    Applicant should pass an exam and interview related to firearm safety, handling & storage precautions and use of firearm as well as awareness regarding prevailing law for hunting, shooting sports, carrying firearms and use of firearms for in-house, in-vehicle and personal self-defense.\n\n4.    A system and software  to acquire fired bullet projectile from firearm (that applicant purchased from vendor), scan projectile and spent case for signature marks of firearm and store in database, should be developed and implemented. (A patent application pending in USPTO in this regard)\n\n5.    Above mentioned system will serve as reference point and database for law enforcement and criminal investigation agencies for detection of firearm if a licensed firearm is used in an incident or crime.\n\n6.    Licenses should be categorized as follows;\n \na.    Hunting Sports\nb.    Shooting Sports\nc.    Enthusiast\nd.    Self Defense\ne.    Special Needs\nf.    Security Agency\n \n\n7.    A proof for para 6 claim from applicant should be provided, for example membership card of firing range, membership of hunting sports organization, hunting license, recommendations for amateurs from two existing  members etc.\n\n8.    A database of hunters  be maintained by the licensing wildlife department and shooting sportsmen by shooting sports organizations.\n\n9.    Following are recommendations for firearms for which licenses should be allowed;\n\na.    All shotguns except “FULL AUTO” allowed as full auto shotgun is not meant for any sports or self-defense purpose.\nb.    All handguns of any caliber except “FULL AUTO” for same reason as above.\nc.    All rifles of .17, .22 (Types: Short, Long Rifle & Magnum) calibers.\nd.    Rifles for hunting purpose only for all caliber up to (.336 bore or 8mm) with magazine capacity of “8 Bullets maximum” except “FULL AUTO”. Please note that most full auto or military firearms have more than 8 (usually 20 or 30) bullets magazines.\ne.    Para 9(d) firearms/rifles common calibers are .223, .243, .270, .300, .308, 30-06, .336, 5.56 mm, 7mm, 8mm.\nf.    All pneumatic/air/CO2 pistols and guns should be license free. These are commonly called Air Guns or Air Rifles.\ng.    Cartridge purchase limit should be 500 for shooting sports and 50 for others. While limit to keep any time should be 10000 for sportsmen and 500 for others. Please note that usually sportsmen shoot 200 to 500 rounds for practice in one session or day. These statistic can be verified from any range master (Lahore Rifle Club, Wah/Shaheen Shooting Range or Guns Club, Islamabad). These sportsmen earn fame and medals for our country.\nh.    Hunting & Sports firearms should be kept secure and locked at homes or storage location and department/office should be pre-informed of the location and arrangement. \ni.    Shooting a hunting or sports firearm within municipal/city area should be completely prohibited for any purpose except use at firing ranges.\nj.    All shooting for "joy and celebration/ shooting in air" should be totally prohibited and punishable by law. \nk.    SPECIAL CATEGORY (currently it is called “prohibited” that is misleading as licenses are issued as PB) should include following;\ni.    Pakistan Ordinance Factory (POF) has designed and manufacturing a range of firearms in 9mm and 308 sporting calibers. There should be an arrangement with POF to allow public sales and licenses for these firearms. This will help eradicate arms smuggling, illegal trade and fake licensing business and boost our economy as well as feel us proud to own firearm made by national company. \nii.    POF can be asked to include .223/5.56 hunting and sports caliber in production range. These firearms should not be “FULL AUTO”.\niii.    Only POF made .223 “NOT FULL AUTO” with 20 round magazine should be available to masses as a SPECIAL CATEGORY weapon.\niv.    This should only be licensed to retired or in service military or civilian servicemen and women, security agencies, engineers, doctors, teachers/professors, IT professionals, expatriates, scientists, agriculturists, highly qualified persons and tax-payers (with a certain minimum limit).\nl.     Awareness should be created regarding types and categories of firearms and cartridges. It is to be noted that even those who make policy or implement it are not well aware of various types and uses of firearms and their bullets.\nm.    Firearm traders and shopkeepers should be scrutinized and a software application should be made in which they record all purchases/sales and corresponding information promptly in real time (like NADRA system upload).\nn.    All FULL AUTO weapons should be made prohibited (No license should be issued to ANYONE in any category). Firearm used by our military/security forces including AK-47 (Kalashnikov), HK G3 and MP5 (full auto) should be banned for possession of civilians. As well as anti-material, anti bullet proof (armour piercing) or incendiary bullets be made non accessible and prohibited for civilian use.\no.    A guidebook of firearms, their safety precautions, governing laws and rules, exam sample and contacts should be published and made mandatory for every firearm holder. \np.    Manual of firearm should be produced by applicant as mandatory and scanned and recorded by department/concerned office.\nq.    Change/modification of weapons/firearms to FULL AUTO mode by any means should be completely prohibited.\nSome quick facts in this regard are also of interest;\n1.    7mm and 7.62 are different calibers and even 7.62 comprises various calibers (like 7.62x39 i.e. Kalashnikov, 7.62x51 (military G3 or civil 308, 7.62x54 is popular hunting cartridge).\n2.    308 is civilian version of 7.62x51 military cartridge used in G3.\n3.    POF is making very good quality and product range of civilian use/sporting firearms, even it exports to USA and western countries. We should benefit from POF by allowing sales to our own country/civilians.\n4.    Pakguns.com is an excellent enthusiast community with highly experienced and regarded moderators/senior members of military, hunting and shooting sports origin. It has thousands members and increasing.\n5.    Some glock pistols and imported 222/223 rifles can be modified to full auto and thereby falling in prohibited category. POF has made it impossible for their guns to be reverted to FULL AUTO.\n6.    Sportsmen earn fame and repute for the country and its citizens. They should be allowed to import (through Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Commerce) firearm (say 5 in a lifetime) of their choice from abroad without tax and duties through quick mechanism, no bribery and hurdles.\n7.

(Reuters) \n \nBEAUMONT, Tex. -- Donald Trump says the tough gun control laws in  Paris contributed to the high death toll during a series of terrorist  attacks on Friday. The attacks, he added, also reveal the danger in  allowing Syrian refugees into the country.\n "You can say what you  want, but if they had guns -- if our people had guns, if they were  allowed to carry -- it would have been a much, much different  situation," Trump said to cheers during a political rally at an arena in  southeast Texas on Saturday afternoon. "I hear it all the time, you  know. You look at certain cities that have the highest violence, the  highest problem with guns and shootings and killings -- Chicago is an  example, toughest gun laws in the United States, nothing but problems.  So our country better get smart because we''re not smart right now."\n By  making that comment, Trump doubled down on a message he tweeted in  January, following a smaller-scale terrorist attack: "Isn''t it  interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest  gun control countries in the world?" As that dated tweet recirculated on  Friday evening, the French ambassador to the United States, Gerard  Araud, tweeted at Trump: "This message is repugnant in its lack of any  human decency. Vulture."\n\n [I][Also read: [URL="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-will-face-questions-shaped-by-paris-attacks-at-tonights-debate/2015/11/14/18059914-8a4b-11e5-be39-0034bb576eee_story.html"]Clinton, Sanders face off in Saturday night debate[/URL]]\n [/I]\n Trump started the rally by leading the crowd of several thousand in a  moment of silence in remembrance of the 129 people killed in the Paris  attacks, which the Islamic State terrorist group has claimed to have  organized. Then Trump launched right into the politics of the attacks.\n\n "What  is going on is terrible," Trump said. "And when you look at what  happened in that case: It was just reported, one from Syria and our  president wants to take in 250,000 from Syria."\nThe crowd booed Syrian refugees for several seconds, then  Trump began again: "No, I mean, think of it: 250,000 people. And we all  have heart, and we all want people taken care of and all of that, but  with the problems our country has, to take in 250,000 people -- some of  whom are going to have problems, big problems -- is just insane. You  have to be insane. Terrible."\n In September, Obama announced that he had [URL="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/10/president-obama-directs-administration-to-accept-at-least-10000-syrian-refugees-in-the-next-fiscal-year/"]directed the U.S. government to accept at least 10,000 refugees, not 250,000, from Syria[/URL] in the next fiscal year, a six-fold increase over the number admitted this year to the United States.\n After  Obama''s announcement, Trump said later that month that if he is elected  president, he will force all Syrian refugees to leave the United  States. He has said that these refugees could be a terrorist army in  disguise and cannot be trusted. Such comments have resonated with rally  crowds across the country and did so again in Texas on Saturday.\n\n"I think they''re wolves in sheep''s clothing," said John Courts, 36, a  Beaumont police officer who attended the rally with his 11-year-old  son. "Bringing those refugees here is very dangerous. Yeah, they need  help but it''s going to bring terrorism right into our front door."\n "I  don''t want any of them here," said Kendall Johns, 43, a Trump supporter  at the rally who lives in Beaumont and works at an oil refinery. "I  mean, send them to Mexico. Send them to Central America. Send them to  South America. I don''t want them here."\n "I do not want  them," said Sheila Milbrandt, 49, a paralegal from Sour Lake, Tex. "We  don''t know who they are. We don''t know their history. We don''t know if  they''re terrorists just being funneled through these other countries.  What do we know about them? We don''t need them here. America needs to  take care of its own."\n\n\n\n[URL]https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/14/donald-trump-says-tough-gun-control-laws-in-paris-contributed-to-tragedy/[/URL]'),

This contraption has no magazine / clip. \n\nIt is a muzzle loader. Yes, you heard me. The arrows have to be put in from the muzzle in a inverse manner. In other words, it is a single shot weapon. \nWhich is easier? \n\nThis contraption =\nsafety off \ntake aim\nshoot\n[B][U][I]completely re-adjust the position of the weapon to access the muzzle easily[/I][/U][/B]   ( this is where the most time is wasted by changing into that position and back ; if the rifle was shorter, you could avoid this step entirely, but lengthwise it is as long as a average rifle. No chance of that being possible. )\n\nLook here= [URL]https://youtu.be/LLFQz4bEJiA?t=1m31s[/URL]\n\nget arrow from quiver ( this has no place to hold the arrows on the weapon itself ) \n[B][I][U]Align it with the barrel in a reverse manner[/U][/I][/B]\n[B][I][U]Feed it down the barrel\nCock weapon[/U][/I][/B]\nAim/adopt position\nshoot. \n\n\nThose in italics /bold/underlined are where you are forced to give up your position to the game by being forced to move and adjust the weapon, not to mention easily, 5-8 seconds of time to complete. \n\n\nBow=\nNock a arrow\npull back\naim\nShoot\nGet another arrow ( its usually on the bow itself so this is very quickly done ) \nNock again and repeat\n\nOnly one arm needs to move in this entire process. \n\nCrossbow =\nLoad weapon ( pull back and lock string) \nAlign arrow with correct side on the reciver ( its usually alternately colored to signify that) \nAim\nShoot\nAnother arrow from crossbow holder thing \n\n\n\nBasically, taking a follow up shot with this is like saying you can take follow up shots with a break barrel air rifle. Not happening unless the game is completely brain-dead.\n\nNote the cost too, its MSRP is 849 USD. + the cost of a pump ( 150 USD ) AND the cost of a scuba cylinder ( 300 USD about, in carbon fiber and 100-150 in aluminium ) \n\nCompare that to a very nice compound bow or Cbow, 500-600 USD'),

Bringing in muzzleloading firearms is like going to a pistol range with a cannon, and when the guy next to you asks about double tapping, you just destroy the target, target stand and half the range with a single shot ; Then look him in the eye and say why would i need to?\n\n\n The only thing that this shares with a muzzleloader, is long loading times due to being forced to load from the muzzle. And the annoyance of having to reset the position of your gun after every shot in order to re-load it. \n\nGoing back to a more sensible comparison, a crossbow is not a magical death machine. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that you may need to perform a follow up shot. \n\nRegarding legality, this falls into air rifle hunting.'),

It must be a long time back. You must be enjoying the ease now as complete assemblies are available with drivers and heat sinks already attached and even enclosures to go with them.\n\nI had a little experience while attempting to make an LED lightbar for offroad use out of raw LEDs. At that time a very few people were importing LED lightbars for 4x4s and were selling those for around Rs.50,000. Now those bars are down to 1/3rd of that price.\n\nKhair, at that time, matching drivers, heat sinks, enclosures and reflectors were almost non-existent. Few people had them and that too mismatched or unsuitable. Even sourcing thermal paste was a challenge...So my experiment went on hold and a few years later the market was full of complete plug-n-play assemblies and lightbars etc. Alhamdo Lillah.\n\nAnd heat is always there except if its a photon based light source...Even so, one cannot hold a small halogen bulb with bare fingers for more than three seconds when its ON. The related equipment is always designed to withstand all that heat. The problems occur mostly due to substandard equipment and materials used.\n\nKind regards'),

A ACOG or a Red dot/holosight. \n\nOh, be careful, you might end up buying a gun that is considered to be PB in pak and post it hear. Check before you post.\n\nPost some pics of that ammo too. \n\nLook up youtube for cleaning a ar 15, and make sure to oil the gun and wipe off grease before first use. \n\nBUY MORE AMMO. \n\nand of different brands. 200-300 rounds is enough to break it in, use junk ammo for it. ( i usually fire Tulammo for junk plinking ammo) \n\nThen when you have that all done, decide if you wanna shoot accurately or if you wanna shoot fun. \n\nMod your ar accordingly, if you want, and then just keep using tulammo or remanufactured ammo for fun shooting or something like speer, federal etc for accurate. \n\n\nEach ammo is different, buy small boxes first of 4-5 brands then see if your gun likes it or not. If you use optics, remember you have to re-zero the optics for different ammo brands, weights, and loads.\n\nBuy bulk to save cash, i usually go for 500 rounds at a time. It lasts me a month or two.\n\nLearn gun safety rules and trigger discipline. \n\nClean after every use, and buy a budget gun safe ( 200-300 dollars ) or gun locks+ trigger lock. \n\nKeep unloaded when not shooting, or about to shoot. ( Dont load it and go to the range etc, load it AT the range ) Range masters are very finicky, and don''t tolerate breaches in discipline. ( \n\nAlternatively, always remove receiver before storage for safety.  \n\nNow this is the west, so a few rules apply when owning guns. From my own experiences, these have to be followed very strictly. \n\n1.) NEVER talk about your gun. Ever. Don''t tell anyone aside from other gun owners at the range, online ( where you are anonymous ) or other people in your home. Your non-gun loving friends, coworkers, neighbours, keep them in the dark. It is for your own safety above all else. Law enforcement is a exception. If they show up at your door, and ask to come in, the first thing you need to inform them is of the weapon, and where it is. They will , likely take a look, and while they do follow all basic common sense rules. No sudden movements, let them touch the gun first ( don''t pick it up and give it to them ) , have your licence ready to show at all times.  The only time you should mention your own ownership of a gun in casual conversation, is if the other person has done so first. \n\n2.) Inform other people in your house where it is ( depending on their trustworthiness. no kids, no teens ) , and instruct them to never talk about it too. Always keep it locked away, and prohibit access to it unless under your direct supervision. Even when under direct supervision, never hand them ammo, never hand them the mag, never take off the locks. \n\n3.) You have a desire to show it off. I know. I had it too. I still have it . [B][I][U]DONT[/U][/I][/B]. \n\n4.) when taking it anywhere, never keep it in the passenger area in your car. Always the trunk/boot, and follow the same rules as in no 1 if stopped by a cop.\n\n5.) Don''t use your range bags for day to day use. It almost happened to me, nearly took a 9mm round that  I missed to a public mall. \nThey likely smell of gunpowder, and probably have a few loose rounds in them. Don''t use them for anything else other then range use. \n\n6.) Read up on your states gun laws. They vary, and are very unusual. Things like putting a slanted foregrip is illegal, but straight grip is not. Check online before any mods, and before any mods double check with your local gun shop. I live in canada so the laws are mostly the same all round, but that is not such for the US. \n\n7.) On occasion, you will get approached at the range. Put down your rifle and check clear before you start talking to anyone or doing anything else. If a range master is trying to get your attention, and you turn around with your loaded rifle...that will not turn out well. \n\n8.) Make white people friends at the gun shop and range. This is important. We already have a certain....stereotype. ( I have been asked many...questionable things. Gun owners have a much larger right wing demographic then most, so be on guard. ) \n\nUse your most politically correct face, and answer with a smile. \n[I][U]Go out of your way to offer help to other people at the range[/U][/I] Whenever you go to a range, there are some people who just stare.\n\n Which is fine, but just smile back, and if they do it while you are shooting, the best method ive found is to just offer to let them shoot your gun, while making a reference to their staring. If they refuse, insist once or twice, then go back to shooting. So far , that method has served me well.\n\nOnce you are bit better known by the owner, and the crowd there, all is fine. They treat every newcomer with a bit of healthy skepticism, but its a bit more concentrated when it comes to us.\n\n\nThats about it really.'),

You are right I''m shooting olympic where you can aim with gun before you call and not the here in Germany so called "hunting trap" which is some meters nearer to the mashine and the clays are slower. The (better said my) problem is to get quick aim when the clays comes out, picking her up, swing and follow in the first 30% of clays way. And I never know in which direction the clay goes, straigh, high flat, to left or right. When I consider this the clay often is too far. The half of my hits are first, but the other half i a miss with first and a hit with second shot. A bystander who is able to see where my shots really are (youself shooting can hardly see what happens with the shot) told me my swing is to high and the first shot often is above the clay. The second one hits because I got the swing with the flying clay correct.\nSo what I lerned: I need more practicing and as a rentiree i''ve got time enough during this season.

The dealer is selling it for 5x the price. The gun has a barrel that''s not rifled, so you cant fire pellets, even if you could, they wont be accurate beyond 10-12 yards. These are basically guns for small children.\nMy advice would be to put in some more money and buy a Diana 34. \n\n@FA226, hope you''re good bro. Everyone has their own opinions, but I would like to share mine :) You see, I came into this airgun game very late, having the same opinion that you have right now... now when I think about it, it makes me smile. I have had so much fun in the last few years using my airguns. Few things to know....\n\n1. Airguns, even though they don''t use powder as a propellant, are precision tools for really tiny targets for up to 50 yards.\n2. Airguns are good practice, they can be shot in your backyard, or any safe open space.\n3. Airguns give you good knowledge about long range shooting, like hold-over, wind drift etc.\n4. Airguns teach you the basic marksman skills like follow through, breathing control, mil-dots etc.\n\nNow, I have "real" guns (as you might say), but there are numerous problems. First off, where to shoot... I can easily arrange to shoot in different places, but those arrangements have to be made... and I have to drive to get there..etc \n\nAlso, the cost of ammo limits the amount of practice you can get. Another thing is the initial cost of equipment... if you want to get into long range shooting just imagine the ridiculous amounts of money that you''ll need. Now Airgunning isn''t cheap either, but at least manageable. \n\nOne of the common misconception about airguns is that they are not accurate.... well this is usually because the person shooting cannot shoot. Airguns are really accurate, you can expect 1" groups at 30yards from a good gun, if the shooter is really really good(not me :D ) maybe even out to 50 yards.\n\nThen there are tuning, optics, ballistics and I can go on and on (maybe even for days).... and to be honest, like with any other hobby, this is just the tip of the ice-berg.\n\nNow, coming to the point.... I know that you have enough "real" guns :) , so a request.... Please get yourself an airgun. The gun will cost you around 30-32k, the scope and mounts another 7k and some good pellets for about 2 to 2.5k for a tin of 500. Start shooting and tell us what you think. :) I am sure you''ll be thanking me later.\n\nBy the way, out of all the guns that I own(air and powder), I have shot the Diana 34 the most.... around 6k rounds. I don''t think I''ll ever shoot any of my "real" guns this much, ever. \n\nLastly, a few days ago I shot one of my guns after a long time..... and even though I consider myself an average shot, my consistency has drastically improved which I attribute to the ''follow through'' practice that I have had with my air-rifles.\n\nRegards.'),

The gun will cost you around 30-32k, the scope and mounts another 7k and some good pellets for about 2 to 2.5k for a tin of 500. Start shooting and tell us what you think. :) I am sure you''ll be thanking me later.\n\nBy the way, out of all the guns that I own(air and powder), I have shot the Diana 34 the most.... around 6k rounds. I don''t think I''ll ever shoot any of my "real" guns this much, ever. \n\nLastly, a few days ago I shot one of my guns after a long time..... and even though I consider myself an average shot, my consistency has drastically improved which I attribute to the ''follow through'' practice that I have had with my air-rifles.\n\nRegards.'),
