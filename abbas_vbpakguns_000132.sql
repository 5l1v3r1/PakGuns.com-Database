Furthermore, just for an extra precaution''s sake, in order to avoid unnecessary hassles with lower and ignorant security staff on the roads, plz, during imposition of sect.144, do not carry your weapon in crowded places, nor outside of your car, even if concealed. We may get away with it eventually, but I do not deem it advise-able still.

(77333, ' Lionheart bro........you may have a valid point in your request, I agree, and leave it for the mods or admin, yet I must say, I think it will be very hard to post pictures of such differences, unless someone actually does buy a clone and give some in-depth review of it with all photographic details.\n\n I''m not sure a dealer would allow his item an x-ray of such an extent, leave alone taking pictures without the intent of buying that specific item, especially not, if he already has be-fooled anyone, in theory, about originality of the item. Second there are too many clones out there, no uniform standard, from which to extract major differences from originals and counterfeits. Best, for a gun enthusiast, with some common sense, is to ask the dealer how to field strip it, don''t do it even if you do know how to do it, let him help you, and with some common sense use your best judgement and inspect the item from all angles, especially the interior of it. A counterfeit will show it''s poor class, easily! \n\nLook, there will [b]always[/b] be a difference, no matter how skillfully a copy has been made, yet to assess it properly, you need to have it before you, especially because of the better technology applied like with the recent Cougar model. For this particular model, however, even the writing on the gun itself differs in being white, yet, they may change it soon too. No pictures as such, IMHO, can help as such, especially bearing in mind, that the latest items out there, indeed, have been very skillfully produced.', ''),

I do agree with your answers that dealer would simply not allow to x-ray their products  but my idea is  when ever someone went to their dealer with intention of buying someone  or even already bought some good clone, in this senior i think he can take few close-up photos (not saying strip down the gun) but photos of ever corner for example;  opened chamber photos from different angles, Barrel, Engraved writing etc etc ..  like so and post it with its specifications. \n\nI am also not saying  just by looking these photos our expert or senior members start giving their expert opinions how to differentiate this clone from its original model.  It could be done after physical check so If any one would get this chance of handling any good clone (request a person who has the clone) so field strip it and compare it with original hand by hand (if possible )  when will give their feedback of differentiating b/w both  even it can be a weight difference, like so  (it could be any thing)  and then if possible will post some photos as well. \n\nThen i am sure even a single clue will be helpful in differentiate the Clone from its Original .   Even if separate thread will only have good Clones phone/details all in one place (without having difference analysis) so everyone specially new users/inexperienced will get alarmed/be-aware that so and so clones are already in the market if they are looking for original things. \n\nWhy i am emphasizing on this just because i really felt the need of this particular separate thread after looking  Anthrax''s topic about Stoeger''s amazing clone.  A month back i was making my mind that when ever i will have that License/budget i can think about having Stoeger and previously i was only thinking about PT92/99  BUT now after knowing about that Stoeger clone, I would batter be careful while buying it (surely will need some expert advise or his presence).

As such, a separate thread may not be totally out of need, I agree, yet what I was trying to come to, is, that it will be very difficult with the vast majority of clones out there, all with different traits and qualities, some better some inferior, to notify of [i]common faulty \ntraits[/i] as such.

I''m hitting a little towards 4 o''clock - 5 o''clock region. Checked and learn''t that I''m probably gripping it too tightly.[/quote]\n\nthats great brother.. you seem to find it correct. May be your fingers are gripping inconsistently over the front strap of grip...but theres another reason which probably is most likely in your case and my case as well as i do that too. So I am with you.\nAlso do check by dry firing(use snap cap if you like) that while under stress, do you, when pulling trigger, pull the pistol as well in direction of the motion of trigger. Most of us are right handed, pistol in right hand when being pulled at trigger with index finger will move a bit to right and a little low! and hence 4 or 5 O'' clock hits to the bullseye. \nIdeally this should not happen, we can control it by first practice dry firing to see the cause, ofcourse if find the issue then you can eliminate it. As the term suggests Squeeze the trigger, it actually Squee-eee-zee - ing. To me it is to over come the pre-travel and letting the shot off while consistently focusing on the front sight untill you are surprised by the shot. \nAlso we can overcome this easily by practice in slow shooting, but after a couple of shots, adrenaline kicks in. Theres kinda shake-in thingy that starts at this point, so it is the break time, for a couple of long breaths to relax and then start again. This will also become better with practice and so on.\nBeing good at Sqee-eee-ze''-ing the trigger everytime in quick successive shots is the next thing which will require further practice but make sure your earlier step is cleared repeatedly to conform with consistency.\nBro SA, these are my own findings and tips which I practice with and just for info I am an amateur shooter with 85% way to go.', ''),

Section 144 of the Criminal procedure code states and i quote\n\n"Power to issue order absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger. in cases where, in the opinion of a District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, (or of any other Executive Magistrate] specially empowered by the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate to act under this section, there is sufficient ground for proceeding under this section and immediate prevention or speedy remedy is desirable, such Magistrate may, by a written order stating the material facts of the case and served in manner provided by section 134, [b]direct any person to abstain from a certain act or to take certain order with certain property in his possession or under his management, if such Magistrate considers that such direction Is likely to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance or injury, or risk of obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person lawfully employed, or\ndanger to human life, health or safety, or a disturbance of the public tranquility, or a riot, or an affray."\n[/b]\n\n[i]Source: [url]http://www.punjabpolice.gov.pk/user_files/File/criminal_procedure_code_1898.pdf[/url][/i] Page 40\n\nI am no legal expert but the above clearly allows the relevant authority to restrict [b]any[/b] activity or take out a certain order which in the officers judgement prevents or tends to prevent any obstruction, nuisance or or risk to public tranquility etc etc.  No where does it say speak about what the nature of restrictions or orders in any form. Hence while in the past the imposition of Section 144 would have simply restricted the open display of arms etc. The issuing authority can very simply impose a complete ban on carrying of arms under this section. On the other hand i''ve tried very hard to obtain a copy of the most recent order imposing ban on carrying to verify the exact order but have failed to find one.

They mostly deal in local guns but for the past couple of months they''ve also started importing weapons specially from Turkey. \n\nIn the imported weaponry, they have shotguns from Hatsan Escort. In pistols, currently they have the Norinco NP22, Kanusi-s, Stoeger Cougar, Tangfolio Viper 9mm (Not the old design - the new one with rails) and Ghost TR-01. In clones, they''ve got the best Beretta 92FS clone that you can get in Lahore. They also have the Stoeger clone. \n\nThey also have reasonably priced ammunition and currently I think they have Elley and Shaheen brand shotgun shells. In pistols, they have a lot of .30 and 9mm bullets. Everything is reasonably priced. They also have a wide variety of holsters and knives. \n\nI took [b]SlayerJatt[/b] today to their shop and he was very pleased.

The five five six rd from a 20 inch barrel kills primarily because of the bullet breaking up into three parts inside the target or by yawing and thus causing a large wound channel. \nAt the reduced velocities from short barrels of the M4 carbine etc these effects do not occur; this is what is causing complaints and the need for the 6.8 SPC. About the hydrostatic shock it appears no one told the Taliban or the Iraqi''s they are supposed to be shocked when shot.\nI have taken all types of game and even a 7mm Magnum shooting a 160 gr Nosler Partition at 3000 feet per second does not shock an animal when hit squarely between the shoulders, I have seen Ibex, and Urial run 20 to 50 yds before dropping. You bet if the Ibex was holding an AK he would have loosened a complete 30 shot magazine at me before going down.   \nThe 556 is now a 50 year old round and none of the armies using it has been able to discard the old 762; all platoon machine guns are 762 along with sniper rifles.

(77772, ' Though a lot has been written about the performance of this pistol but I thought I might also share my view as I fired extensively with CF98 in last 20 days or so. I also understand that a range report without pics virtually means nothing but it just did not occur to me while I was firing that I should take the pics also. Sorry for that.  Most of the time forgot to take my camera along and actually, remained too focused on firing alone. \n\nIn all, I fired around 800 rounds of different ammo in the last 20 days. This included 50 rounds of Chinese Blue Box (2008 lot), 100 rounds of POF 1Z (2006 lot) and around 650 rounds of POF 2Z (different lots from 2002 to 2008). The results were as following.\n\n-  There were no misfires with any of the three ammo.\n\n-  5 jammed out of 800. All of them were POF 2Z and all were within first 200 rounds that I fired from this pistol. No jams   afterwards (this could have been due to faulty cartridges or the experts may comment better whether its a fault or a fluke).\n\n-  Initially, the weapon was continuously firing below the point of aim when I was aiming with rear and front sights aligned / levelled. Then I kept front sight tip a little higher than the rear sight and the pistol started firing quite accurately.   \n\n-  The weapon turned out to be a very accurate one. I fired 50 rounds each from CF98, Baretta 92FS, Akdal Ghost and NP22 (there is no specific reason for selecting these pistols, infact they were the one available to me :)). CF98 and Baretta 92FS were at par and quite accurate, followed by NP22, Akdal Ghost was an unimpressive last. Distribution of these 50 rounds was 10 from 30 ft, 10 from 50 ft, 10 from 75 ft and 20 rounds (2 mags of 10 each) were fired in a rapid fire test. Though I am not a good firer but I could make around 4-6 inches group from 30 ft and 6-8 inches group from 50 ft with CF98 & 92fs. \n\n-  CF98 (along with Beretta 92fs, offcourse) was most impressive in the rapid fire (in which I draw the weapon from holster and fire 10 rounds on 2 target in a sequence of 2,2,2,2,1,1. ie, I change aim 6 times. Reload and again fire 10 rounds in the same sequence. I try to complete two magazines in 20 seconds. (I understand this is not a standard test and something specific to my style of firing). The balance, pointability, recoil and accuracy of CF98 was quite satisfying during this test, far better than Akdal Ghost and NP22.  \n\n-  I found that fire was most accurate with POF 2Z. Bullets were continuously hitting below the point of aim while firing with Chinese and POF 1Z ammos. Chinese was better than POF 1Z but no match to POF 2Z from which I was achieving a good number of bull hits. This may have been because I fired more of POF 2Z ammo and got used to it but still, there was a visible difference. \n\n-  There was no apparent wear and tear to the gun after firing around 650 rounds of POF 2Z which I believe is a +p ammo (please correct me if I am wrong). If that be so than CF98 fired +p ammo better than standard ammo. \n\n-  No problems were faced with the safety lever. It was absolutely smooth. (a member mentioned hardened safety lever of CF98 in one of the posts). \n\n-  Though a little big for CC, I found it convenient to carry CF98 in a side holster. It is light and does not make a mess of the belt / trousers. Wearing jackets in winters takes care of the size, however, during summers, it would show quite easily. \n\nI have just tried to pen down the facts as they occurred and  have mostly refrained from passing any judgments because I do not think I am qualified enough to do it. I leave it up to the experts and senior members. Again sorry for not posting the pics :(.\n\nregards', ''),

C''mon guys i''m not saying you are wrong but there are two sides to every argument.[/quote]\n\nI agree with @ [b]Glocky[/b] to keep this topic open for the following reasons,\n\n1- It will keep us (specially who travel a lot all over Pakistan and CC their arms) updated regarding carrying our arms or any change/new notifications.\n\n2- It will also keep us updated regarding "MODE" of law peoples and licensee''s status in different province regardless of notifications (situation on "GROUND ZERO").\n\n3- We can learn from the members who got some experience on the "POLICE NAKAS" and tips and tricks of "MEN OF LAW".\n\nSecondly, for the clarity, the discussed MOI notification is especially issued to address the confusion of licensee''s status in case of imposition of SEC 144 in different parts of Pakistan (if you read the last part of paragraph# 2 of the letter and the paragraph #3 explain how).\n\nI always carry my arms in out city trips, in last few days I traveled to RWP/ISB and Pewshawar with my 9mm in a small hand bag under my driving seat, didn''t got any trouble.\n\nHere are few tips I learned on NAKAS and regular check posts.\n\ni) Keep your license in your pocket not in the bag/?? you keep your arms (keep your license with you especially when you are leaving your vehicle in the i.e.parking etc. and your arms in it) , \nii) If asked or discovered, tell them what it is and handover your license first, \niii) Make sure the bullet  is not in the chamber when you are traveling in the city or on the main roads,\niv) Always remove the magazine (if loaded) before you hand over your arms for serial/license # verification to the relevant persons.\nv) Don''t handover (even show) your arms to uniformed/UN-uniformed person on the NAKAS at unexpected places i.e. village roads, roads in unpopulated areas etc. Unless you are sure that they are real police  (ask for ID if possible especially when UN-uniformed).\nvi) Be confident and keep it in your mind that you are not carrying anything illegal(If it is not of-course  ;) ). \nand best of luck.', ''),

It shows this gun is a reliable and a good gun to carry. I myself have fired & tested 2 CF98s for about 200 rounds with no misfire or stoppages and found the accuracy quiet good once you get a feel of the gun and the ammo. I wish you had pics or videos made as it would have proved a treasure for CF98 enthusiasts and owners. I made sure to have my camera with me whenever went to the firing range as when i bought my CF98 not a single video of its firing was available but now quiet few are on youtube showing it in action, but your videos would have been no less then a treasure. \n\nAnd can you tell how many bullets you fired from CF98 in one go ??

(77794, ' Salams, \n\nSome of us like to bulk buy ammo when we''re getting a good price and use it as we go along. Although modern ammunition hardly ever spoils in a time period of 10 or 20 years for that matter, if you store it correctly it will still be shiny new and fresh whenever you take it out for use. I bought half a case of Federal 9mm''s two years back and left it lying around. Although the bullets fire just fine, they look old and weathered and now are referred to as ''Purani Golian''.\n\nTo keep ammo fresh, it must be kept in a waterproof and airtight container along with something like sawdust or silica gel thrown in to absorb any moisture.\n\n \nHere is a quick little tutorial on how to store ammo easily and effectively. \n\n\nI have used:\n\n1).

Also I am looking for a bullet puller any brand will suffice.\nLastly the media in my brass cleaner (Lee) is expired and being that we are not living in the states, any ideas as to what media I can try to clean the brass?[/quote]\n\nDear Moeen Sb\n\nTake the media out of the tumbler and after spreading it on a news paper spray it with a can of starch you use for ironning your favorite shirt. Dry it with a hair dryer (your wife will be rather upset ) and  it will work fine.\n\n2nd Method\n\nTake a very fine polish which is used after painting cars and the final rubbing is done with it; its name is Fine Polishing Paste without silicone top quality painters use it after final polishing. (it is not the usual compound ) STP Scratch Out  car polish will also do fine\n\nAdd to your media and run the your vibratory tumbler without cases for an hour or so. If you also starch and dry it; it would give very good results. The paste is water soluble and I would recommend wiping your shiny cases with a wet cloth after cleaning to remove any trace of the polish. Try using a mix of pistol/revolver cases with the rifle cases some how all cases  come out with more shine this way.\n\nI have only one RCBS inertia puller and a set of collet puller also by RCBS so I can not spare it but I will find one  for you.\nNow the Trimmer. I do have one spare but already promised to a friend but will find one or get one for you the moment some friend travels from the hand loaders heaven.\nYou seem to be an advanced reloader, I am very happy to know that there are so few of us.\nKeep your loads safe and accurate', ''),

For me I would say one must take this letter along to the DCO office in Lahore and let them know of their right too. Maybe they are not even aware of any such directive issued from MOI. As for the term "provincial home department(s)", being plural it must be applicable to all four provinces. I have no doubt in it. Basically it has been informed to Sindh Govt that all provinces are allowed to issue licenses for bolt action rifles. \nI would strongly advise that our punjab members do contact their relevant DCO''s with copy of this letter and persuade them to start issuing bolt action rifle licenses in punjab as well.', ''),

Sure it was fun shooting this time again as it has always been before but I always emphasize on learning something new every time I attend a session of shooting. We had brief time at our private range, even though there is no proper facility there as such but I still like to call it my RANGE. \nI used my own pistol only this time which happens to be a 92FS Pak made clone, my bro and friend enjoyed shooting with a Zastava CZ999 9mm pistol. \nWe fired a total of 200 rounds in as much as under 90 minutes. Details of which are as under:\nCZ999 - 50 rounds of Norinco blue box "Factory 71 headstamp" ammo.\n92FS clone - 80 rounds of POF MKIIZ, 8 rounds of Norinco FMJ blue box (311 factory ammo), 130 rounds of local reloads (Baber Ammo Factory)\n\n[b]Impression on Shooting and my findings:[/b]\nWell as I mentioned earlier, I always like to have something new learned on shooting. But this time I just went backwards. Surprisingly I was not able to stop blinking my eyes while shots went off. This thing in particular I have given much time and practice to overcome lately. Also I would like to add that I dont use ear muffs at all. This is to ensure that I get used to keep my eyes opened with my gun going boom in my face everytime, keeping in mind SD scenarios where I would require to put a bullet in the intended path crucially. I know that many of new shooters do that but having it learnt and then unlearn later on is depressing. But still it was fun to shoot anyway, got some better groups as well on the paper. Next time, I plan to practice again and will hopefully make myself watch the climbing muzzle, i.e. front sight going up and then coming back to the place where it started to jump from. You know why it is important, mainly because for a follow-up shot, if your eyes are not tracing the movement of front sight GO UP and back DOWN during firing cycle, you cannot always put your pistol in the same plane/axis to where it was, as on the previous shot.\nMy friend and my bro did some fun with CZ999 and they say they were enjoying so I was kind of letting them enjoy this time.\n\n[b]Impression on Ammo:[/b]\n----------------------------\nCZ999 fired all Chinese blue box ammo, without a single FTE or FTF or misfires. 50 rounds were fired, all butter smooth.\n92FS clone did its 1st round of 8 shots of norinco 311 stamped FMJ ammo, then with 80 rounds of POF MKIIZ without a hitch. Consistent recoil and muzzle blast on every shot. MKIIZ went cycling like premium grade ammo in my clone. I noticed that even the ejection of brass is typical and consistent every time POF round was cycled. \nNow the local reloads by Baber ammo factory, well out of 130 rounds, 2 rounds required a double action pull to get them launched, but what they really did bad was, they produced a lot of soot which was like pouring down in the breech area, frame rails, and even guide rod and just about every where in the pistol. I also found some yellow tinkles/particles sticking here and there in my slide and breech. It was real dirty ammo and also gave me about 10 FTE due to inconsistent pressure peaks, or may be there was issues with those cases.\n\n[b]Video Links:[/b]\n-----------------\nMyself with Pak made Beretta 92FS clone \n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI14ADlxt0c[/url] \nNote: Please forgive me, if you dont like my slide not sticking back on slide stop after every last round in the mag was fired, this is due to stiff slide release lever.

I went out of his shop, with 15 loaded, fired the thing towards a wall in the rear, 12 fine shots, 2 jams, one miss! Reason? Well, in my case, it was due to faulty P.O.F rounds, had loaded 5 of them, 5 russians and 5 federal Luger. Whenever it would jam, misfire, we''d check the round, it would be the P.O.F one every time!

(78069, ' @Selfdefence26...........As you may see from my above post, I clearly wrote in my opening line, that some members may oppose the suggestion, and I was a bit reluctant to give it. Why? Because, I find it a bit [i]unethical[/i], coz it''s actually only a "proforma" deal, but was intended for someone in absolute emergency, if he neither can afford a local gun, OR, doesn''t WANT a local gun, yet wants to save his license. Course, if non of these two things are of concern, one should just buy a cheap local gun and have it entered, and thus avoiding the unethical part of a pro-forma deal. Having gone clear on this, let me now reply the remaining of your question.\n\nNothing is 100% in our country, yet many things are 99.5%! I personally have seen this before my eyes, when a cousin of mine was short of funds for a while, didn''t want to buy or keep a local gun, yet wanted to preserve his license. The dealer cooperated and sold him a desi gun on papers only, stamped his license with details of the gun and he had it later registered at the concerned authorities. He saved his license. 6 months later the guy went for a genuine Beretta M-9, in the +200K range. Course a guy like him didn''t want Desi stuff in his possession, yet was only concerned about his license. Authorized and registered, low profile dealers, selling mostly local guns, have the least of scruples with [i]audits[/i] from any department whatsoever, coz these local guns have no proper back-track in records, like the imported ones with all details from export, import, retail. So, it''s not any big issue for the dealer at all. Bear still in mind, we''re in Pakistan.\n\nRegarding your second question about a new weapons entry on "another" page of the license, I think you misunderstood something in my post. I didn''t mean two entries on the same license on different pages. Course not. That is not possible at all. What I meant is, that when you buy any new weapon, initial entry stands cancelled, by automatic process, subsequent entry on another page stands valid, by automatic process. Hence, another page, course you cannot have two weapons entered on the same page, nor two valid entries on one license. That is not legal, but the other thing I mention is normal and fully legal procedure.\n\n\nBear in mind, that you''re always allowed to change your weapons on the same MOI license, provided you stay within the range of weapons allowed on it. In old days, and especially with provincial licenses, I think this used to be a problem. With an MOI, you can change your weapon as frequently as you wish, just ensure that a separate application to the DCO office for record entrance of newly acquired weapon is forwarded every time, and endorsed also. This is no problem at all. I hope now you''re clear, and I repeat, this is only an emergency solution, yet fully practical, though I''m not a supporter of it. The forum is based for exchange of experience, and I''ve experienced above method working out positively in favor of a license holder, whose license otherwise would have stood cancelled. Thanx.', ''),

Sure it was fun shooting this time again as it has always been before but I always emphasize on learning something new every time I attend a session of shooting. We had brief time at our private range, even though there is no proper facility there as such but I still like to call it my RANGE. \nI used my own pistol only this time which happens to be a 92FS Pak made clone, my bro and friend enjoyed shooting with a Zastava CZ999 9mm pistol. \nWe fired a total of 200 rounds in as much as under 90 minutes. Details of which are as under:\nCZ999 - 50 rounds of Norinco blue box "Factory 71 headstamp" ammo.\n92FS clone - 80 rounds of POF MKIIZ, 8 rounds of Norinco FMJ blue box (311 factory ammo), 130 rounds of local reloads (Baber Ammo Factory)\n\n[b]Impression on Shooting and my findings:[/b]\nWell as I mentioned earlier, I always like to have something new learned on shooting. But this time I just went backwards. Surprisingly I was not able to stop blinking my eyes while shots went off. This thing in particular I have given much time and practice to overcome lately. Also I would like to add that I dont use ear muffs at all. This is to ensure that I get used to keep my eyes opened with my gun going boom in my face everytime, keeping in mind SD scenarios where I would require to put a bullet in the intended path crucially. I know that many of new shooters do that but having it learnt and then unlearn later on is depressing. But still it was fun to shoot anyway, got some better groups as well on the paper. Next time, I plan to practice again and will hopefully make myself watch the climbing muzzle, i.e. front sight going up and then coming back to the place where it started to jump from. You know why it is important, mainly because for a follow-up shot, if your eyes are not tracing the movement of front sight GO UP and back DOWN during firing cycle, you cannot always put your pistol in the same plane/axis to where it was, as on the previous shot.\nMy friend and my bro did some fun with CZ999 and they say they were enjoying so I was kind of letting them enjoy this time.\n\n[b]Impression on Ammo:[/b]\n----------------------------\nCZ999 fired all Chinese blue box ammo, without a single FTE or FTF or misfires. 50 rounds were fired, all butter smooth.\n92FS clone did its 1st round of 8 shots of norinco 311 stamped FMJ ammo, then with 80 rounds of POF MKIIZ without a hitch. Consistent recoil and muzzle blast on every shot. MKIIZ went cycling like premium grade ammo in my clone. I noticed that even the ejection of brass is typical and consistent every time POF round was cycled. \nNow the local reloads by Baber ammo factory, well out of 130 rounds, 2 rounds required a double action pull to get them launched, but what they really did bad was, they produced a lot of soot which was like pouring down in the breech area, frame rails, and even guide rod and just about every where in the pistol. I also found some yellow tinkles/particles sticking here and there in my slide and breech. It was real dirty ammo and also gave me about 10 FTE due to inconsistent pressure peaks, or may be there was issues with those cases.\n\n[b]Video Links:[/b]\n-----------------\nMyself with Pak made Beretta 92FS clone \n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI14ADlxt0c[/url] \nNote: Please forgive me, if you dont like my slide not sticking back on slide stop after every last round in the mag was fired, this is due to stiff slide release lever. It has gone really stiff after installation of Hogue wrap around grips actually.

I will have to fire full pack of 50 rounds then it could be judged for the problem.[/quote]\n\nAta Sir, hopefully the problem would be over when you fire more with this pistol. Though the experts would be able to comment better but IMHO, there could be two reasons for these jams (in my case, it was failure to feed every time and happened with POF 2Z ammo only). In fact I should have given these observations when I mentioned 5 jams in my report but since my post was already becoming a thesis so I preferred to be brief. \n\n1. Faulty ammo, as already mentioned by senior members.\n\n2. The magazine. In fact this was one area where I found CF98 lacking. The quality of magazine does not go at par with the rest of the pistol. In my case, the magazine cover (a removable lid at the bottom of the magazine) of both the magazines would open up a bit while firing (less than half a centimeter). As you can observe by moving the magazine cover, it does move the follower spring and follower base plate a little which might effect the bullet feeding (I am not sure about it). After having observed this thing, I used to check every time before fire that magazine cover is in its proper position. I am still not sure whether those 5 jams in my case were due to movement of magazine cover or due to faulty ammo or due to any other reason, but it has not happened even once in last several hundred rounds that I have fired with my pistol. Only happened initially, however, experts can comment better. \n\nregards', ''),

(78207, ' [quote=ay_be_why]gilani saab, two things i would like your comments about: one, the finish of the gun and two, using +p ammo. i think it was 12Gauge who pointed out that the finish is kinda poor, so much so that he now has thumb-impressions at the points where he racks the slide AND that CF-98 may handle +p ammo but it is not designed for it. your views?\n\nThanks[/quote]\n\nCF98 has been in other words made as a replacement of the Chinese TT. As this pistol is replacing the Chinese Army and Police pistols in every service. Even their SWAT teams and Special Forces are using this pistol. It can be called as the workhorse replacing the good old Chinese TT 30 bore. \n\nSo if they had made a finishing like other western pistols, the cost would have gone considerably high as can be seen in western pistols. hardly a good pistol comes below 40K, nearly all are pretty expensive. So China looked for a pistol which may not be having as high grade finishing as western ones but rest of the attributes should be at par with western ones, which i believe the experience of our forum members and the test of Gilani Sir shows. \n\nThe barrel life is also kept low compared to western ones, as we all know how many of us fire how much rounds from our pistols through out its life, very few of us fire hundreds or thousands of rounds through out the life of our pistols, and these very few are also rare in other words. So by reducing the barrel life also, the manufacturer reduced its price. \n\nThus the above attributes made CF98 into a pistol whose finishing is not at par with western ones, but performance can be at par with them. As Chinese Army is practical one, they wanted a weapon which can work when needed, not a weapon admired for its looks or finishing. \n\nI believe it is the one of the two popular pistol in circulation with rotating barrel mechanism, the other being Cougar 8000. \n\nChinese must have tested this mechanism to its limit after which they adopted this mechanism to be a standard for their new standard service pistol.\n\nAnd as for your second part, well Chinese use their QSZ-92 with only DAP rounds in service, which i believe is more powerful round then +p standard ammo.\nEven the booklet of CF98 says it can fire DAP rounds, so if it can fire DAP rounds, it should easily be handling the +p ammo too. \n\nRegards', ''),

(78269, ' [quote=AK47]@Selfdefence26...........As you may see from my above post, I clearly wrote in my opening line, that some members may oppose the suggestion, and I was a bit reluctant to give it. Why? Because, I find it a bit [i]unethical[/i], coz it''s actually only a "proforma" deal, but was intended for someone in absolute emergency, if he neither can afford a local gun, OR, doesn''t WANT a local gun, yet wants to save his license. Course, if non of these two things are of concern, one should just buy a cheap local gun and have it entered, and thus avoiding the unethical part of a pro-forma deal. Having gone clear on this, let me now reply the remaining of your question.\n\nNothing is 100% in our country, yet many things are 99.5%! I personally have seen this before my eyes, when a cousin of mine was short of funds for a while, didn''t want to buy or keep a local gun, yet wanted to preserve his license. The dealer cooperated and sold him a desi gun on papers only, stamped his license with details of the gun and he had it later registered at the concerned authorities. He saved his license. 6 months later the guy went for a genuine Beretta M-9, in the +200K range. Course a guy like him didn''t want Desi stuff in his possession, yet was only concerned about his license. Authorized and registered, low profile dealers, selling mostly local guns, have the least of scruples with [i]audits[/i] from any department whatsoever, coz these local guns have no proper back-track in records, like the imported ones with all details from export, import, retail. So, it''s not any big issue for the dealer at all. Bear still in mind, we''re in Pakistan.\n\nRegarding your second question about a new weapons entry on "another" page of the license, I think you misunderstood something in my post. I didn''t mean two entries on the same license on different pages. Course not. That is not possible at all. What I meant is, that when you buy any new weapon, initial entry stands cancelled, by automatic process, subsequent entry on another page stands valid, by automatic process. Hence, another page, course you cannot have two weapons entered on the same page, nor two valid entries on one license. That is not legal, but the other thing I mention is normal and fully legal procedure.\n\n\nBear in mind, that you''re always allowed to change your weapons on the same MOI license, provided you stay within the range of weapons allowed on it. In old days, and especially with provincial licenses, I think this used to be a problem. With an MOI, you can change your weapon as frequently as you wish, just ensure that a separate application to the DCO office for record entrance of newly acquired weapon is forwarded every time, and endorsed also. This is no problem at all. I hope now you''re clear, and I repeat, this is only an emergency solution, yet fully practical, though I''m not a supporter of it. The forum is based for exchange of experience, and I''ve experienced above method working out positively in favor of a license holder, whose license otherwise would have stoodThcancelled. Thanx.[/quote]\n\nThanks AK fr yr detailed reply. What I want to know is that when a dealer gets an old gun off yr licence, it means that he has purchased it from you (lets assume in this case that u have sold yr old gun to a dealer) right?. If this is the case, then IS THERE AN ENTRY OF THIS PURCHASE made on yr licence?. e.g "Purchased a 30 bore Khyber Arms pistol model no.12678 from Mr.X".\n\nIf there is no mention (endorsement) of the old purchase of the gun on yr licence by the dealer then I assume that the old purchase entry on the licence STANDS CANCELLED and the entry fr the new gun puchased from the dealer will be the valid one on yr licence and this new gun will have to be registered to the DCO Office right?.\n\nWhat about the OLD GUN which was registered in the DCO OFFICE?. Do u have to inform the DCO OFFICE THAT THE OLD GUN WHICH WAS ENTERED IN THEIR RECORDS IS NOW SOLD AND THAT REGISTRATION IS VOID?\n\nSo the procedure is go to dealer, sell yr old gun buy a new one. Dealer will enter new weapon details on yr licence, get yr new gun registered at DCO. Will the purchase of the new gun automatically mean that the old gun has gotten rid off (i.e. sold) and now the new gun is the fresh entry which will be valid?.\n\nPls clarify to remove confusion.\nThanks,\nSD.\n\n(BY the way, I have a friend who would like to avail this " Paper purchase receipt deal". what dealer in Karachi would be cooperative enough to initiate this process?. any names or references appreciated.)', ''),

I''m sorry if you misunderstood anything in my post which indeed was meant congratulatory only.\n\n With [i]showcase[/i] is not meant anything [i]negative[/i] at all, it''s just that I have a few friends who are very well renowned collectors over here, and one of the guys gets precious items like you quite regularly, yet believe me, they''re all hung up there behind glass cabinets, [i]showcases[/i], on the wall, and really look quite impressive and good there in his drawing room, yet he hasn''t used ANY of his weapons, some of them not even for a test-fire! I think, however, there is nothing [i]wrong[/i] with that, in [i]showcasing[/i], it''s just his way of pursuing his hobby, he doesn''t give a damn about the firing pleasure! Sometimes I even admire him of this, especially because he doesn''t use his items at all. He also has the habit of disposing off an item or so NIB and get a better one, if he feels like, I don''t think a collector would be [u]any less of a collector[/u] if he exchanges his items now and then for the better of it, what do you say? This should remove your doubts about my [i]contradictory[/i] statement, I hope. That''s all I meant, and would indeed enjoy an outing anytime invited so graciously by you, thanks a lot, Sir.\n\n As regards the prices, well, it was only meant for record compilation here on PG which is basically a forum for exchange and share of knowledge and experience, and some of your guns are not that common and perhaps there are some members who would like to have an idea about them, just like you already have mentioned something about your P-22. \n\n In your joy of these beauties, I again wish to extend you my heartiest congrats, Sir!

(78290, ' Hellow Dear Pak Gunners,\n\nAt 26th September,2009 i moved to a gunsmith shop for the repairing of my 32 Bore Revolver Pak Made Clone..When i reached at the shop , the shopkeeper offered me cup of Tea and moved my revolver to workshop situated at the backside of shop..as a regular customer of this gunsmith and having good relation with all the workers,,i thought to met the gunsmith working on my pistol and to ask him about the problem,when i reached there, he finished the repair and now inserting bullets for checking it,,,i moved to him and started to discuss with him about problem, he inserted the bullets and the revolver was cocked...when he closed it while talking to me ,suddenly there was a bang.. and i felt as some one pushed back to my leg... and then the gunsmith shouted...Oye Bhai ko goli lag gaee hai,,when i took a look at my pent, there was a small hole in my pent and blood was splitting out from it,,i was having no pain at all, just feeling that my leg is "SUNN".i walked out at my own feet and tried to sit on the driving seat to drive my car at my own to hospital but my leg didnt allowed me to sit on driving seat.and then gunsmith drived me to hospital.\n\nAfter getting operated my leg,bullett removed at 3rd day.Alhamdullilah got no fracture or major damage to any organs....the bullet touched the main canal of blood but didnt damaged it...as doctor says that in case of damage of this vain,all the blood is splitted within half an hour from the body....\n\nAlhamdullilah now i am fine and back to my work..\n\nSo few learnings which i would like to Share with you from this incident..\n\n[b]1.MIND YOUR BUSINESS[/b]\nNever ever move to the working area of any gunsmith even if he is master at his work.\n\n[b]2.Keep your Self Relax and Recite Ayaat or Darood:[/b]\nAll the Problem are from Allah and Allah gives the courage to handle them,,In such unwanted situations where bullet hits some one, Dont be panic or loose heart bcz Snake aur Bullet actually itna damage nahin karteen, jitna log inkay dar say martay hain,,so dont be Panic but just Recite Darood Pak or some Aaayat while keeping yourself relax and moving to doctor.....I\n\n[b]3.YOU ARE SAFE[/b]\nIf you are concious then keep giving a message to your mind that your life is safe and this injury will not take your life...The bullet just hit only one part of your body and not hit to your life......\n\n\n[b]4.CONTROL THE BLOOD: [/b]\nIf the blood is splitting very fast then you should not allow it to split and take any cloth and round it tightly on your wound to stop the bloodd, so take a bandage of any cloth and put pressure of your hand to stop the blood,,bcz the excess bloodshed can be disasterous for you....\n\n[b]5.Dont waste time[/b]\nEvery single minute and even second is very critical and important in this situation so dont waste any time in shouting or crying and immediately move the pateint to the medical care.\n\n[b]6.Access to Hospital[/b]\nYour ultimate goal after hitting by the bullet should be to seek the medical care of nearest hospital.You can also make a call to 1122 if not having facility to transport but preferably move to hospital on your own conveyence as i mentioned above that time is very important in this scenario. here i am adding this point to tell you that firearm injury is not normally allowed to be treated by the private clinics and private doctors and they refer the patient to Govt. Hospitals as an emergency case for medical treatment..so your first priority should be to reach any Govt hospital in your area....If you are far away from any Govt. hospital and there is risk of life then you may move to a private hospital ,which at least must having a surgeon and opeartion theatre.....\n\nand the last thing is \n\n[b]7.Jisay Allah Rakhay, Usay Kaun Chakhay[/b]', ''),

(78387, ' A warm welcome to all new members. Please read the following post by our Admin, as made earlier in the Member Etiquettes Forum:\n\n[quote=Abbas]Our forum is growing MashAllah and newer members are joining up all the time. Since our forum is such that invariably members are going to run into each other (Weapons purchase, firing ranges, ammo purchasing etc) there are some points that I would like to suggest about dealing with each other.\n\n1). Please remember if another member is giving you advice, he is doing so as a favor to you. You are not paying for it nor is he obliged to answer your query. Thanks to the helping member is always appreciated.\n\n2). Any advice that is given by members to each other is just a suggestion. If it doesn''t work out for you, it''s your problem.\n\n3). Do not ask any member for personal favors like license making, ammunition purchase, money or even transportation of weapons. You are putting the other member in a tight spot and asking to get refused. However if someone offers himself then it should be discussed over PM and PakGuns is not involved in any way.\n\n4). If you don''t know anything about the topic being discussed don''t butt in, ask questions if you have any but don''t pretend to know something you don''t. We all much prefer to answer/discuss than argue. \n\n5). Don''t make useless posts to increase your post count. It really annoys people who come looking for information and find a thread full of "Really?", "Wow", "Awesome". However Thanks for useful information is always welcome !\n\n6). We all like witty comments, long winded stories and enjoy a good laugh as firearms enthusiasts are a lively bunch. However we don''t appreciate personal comments about members, their occupations or raunchy/racy humor.\n\n7). All our members are upstanding / honest in their dealing however like everything in life, please proceed with caution.\n\n8). If you find something offensive in another member''s post then click the Report button instead of dignifying the comment with a reply. \n\nThank you.[/quote]\n\nAlso would like to add the following:\n\n9) Update your location immediate upon registering on PG Forum so that others can see which city you are from.\n\n10) Do not use roman urdu. If you have a query or need to ask someone something, try to phrase your sentence properly so that others are able to understand you. Avoid using chat-style typing.\n\n11) Do not post your cell number or ask others for their contact details. Simply post your email address and request the other member to contact you on it for further personal communication. This is for your own good, peace of mind and security.\n\nHope all new members will consider the above.', ''),

I also apologies if by any way I may have responded that U felt to explain that. We R friends/brothers, we are here to share any knowledge or useful information we have and also get knowledge or information from other members as well. I do respect U as a valuable member of the forum and do enjoy ur posts on the forum along with the information and knowledge U share on the forum.\n\nU R also right about some gun enthusiast, they like guns but they don’t fire them the most. They like to collect and have nice, good and expensive guns. But I like good brands and their products not necessarily expensive but some times quality, realiability and accuracy comes with some price tag. Having said this it’s not necessarily limited to expensive guns. There are many guns with reasonable or low price tag have got quality, realibility and accuracy. For example I do have Stoger Cougar, Walther PPK, Yastava M57 (7.62x25) and Taurus 1911. I use to have Taurus 24/7 9MM in Titanium, PT 145 as well.\n\nU know for me I am not based in Pak. But my nature of job and current duty station permits me to visit back home quite frequently. When I come home my domestic engagements along with the time I spent on my hobbies doesn’t provide me enough time to post all that shooting sports fun that I perform or enjoy. But I do try to share my shooting sports activities as possible as I can. Some times I do realize that I do spend more time with my hobbies than with my family though. ?\n\nBesides this I also like ur recent trip to ur village and appreciate that u shared a nice location along with some guddies.

(78629, ' Salam all,\nA while back at the Isb gtg, I had the pleasure of introducing Sher Khan to some forum members.  I wanted to let everyone know that this is some of whats being manufactured at his factory.   Also, I will try to update this thread from time to time if possible with pictures of other work also being done for other factories... ie yesterday three dozen bright silver sigma magazine bodies arrived at the factory for engraving... things like that.\n\nCurrently this part of the factory is handled by Sher Khan''s two sons Hanif and Shaheen - both sons are Pak-Swiss Karachi certified (four year courses).  They are incharge of all operations at the factory overseeing 35 employees.  The factory is located in Pesh small industrial area behind DSA.  And is licensed.\n\nThis factory produces the following currently: \n1.  Beretta 92\n2.  Beretta 92 with rails\n3.  .30 bore as original (no markings, COMPLETE interchangeable parts with original).\n4.  .30 bore with their own logo (no guarantees on interchangeability of parts).\n\nThe materials (ASTM 4140 for barrels which are button rifled, T3 6061 aircraft grade aluminum) are precision manufactured (cnc edm wire cut, precision investment casting, cnc springs, and cnc engravers and much more) - their parts are hence more prone to easy interchangeability as compared to other manufacturers - quality control is key here and not mass production.\n\nHere are some of the pictures (I am not a photographer so please bear with me):\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqhI5FS][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hI5FS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqhId9i][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hId9i.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqhIfEr][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hIfEr.jpg[/img][/url]\nThe rails on this Beretta are copied as per the Glock 17 3rd gen.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqhIi8A][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hIi8A.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqhIuCi][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hIuCi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqhIH50][img]http://s3.postimage.org/hIH50.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(78642, ' I got to thinking today... just what is it that makes me love guns so much? When a friend mentioned that he knew a fellow who was considering selling or trading a rifle, I started to feel it - that deep-down gotta-have-it feeling. But why? I don''t need another rifle. I don''t have an excess of cash lying around, just waiting for a gun to buy. But something in me wants to own that gun.\n\nIt''s not just that gun, either. I like to tell folks that I want at least one of each... meaning one of every make, every model of gun ever built, of course. Such a statement is met with a variety of responses, from tolerant smiles to head-cocked, eyebrow-raised wonder. What most folks fail to grasp is that I mean it!\n\nI suppose that I can blame a good part of it on my raising. After all, my Dad''s a gunlover, too. Where he got the bug is hard to say, since his father only kept enough guns around for utilitarian purposes, such as defending himself while working in Chicago during the Great Depression, or dispatching a hawk before it ate all his chickens. But Dad got the itch somewhere along the line, and it surely has been passed on to me.\n\nI don''t hunt everything that walks or flies, so claiming to need a different gun for each game animal doesn''t cover it. I have a .44 magnum carbine for hunting deer out to 100 yards, a 30-30 for medium range deer hunting if need be, and a .338 Winchester magnum for reach-out-and-touch-them hunting. With handloads, I can load that .338 down for deer hunting, or up to handle any big game on this continent. I have a .222 Remington for shooting targets and varmints, .22 long rifles for small game, plenty of handguns. So why do I get excited about a rifle I''ve never seen in 7mm Remington Magnum? I really don''t know.\n\nThe bottom line is, it''s a gun. I long ago adopted my father''s motto: "If it shoots, I like it." Some are better than others, of course, but they''re all good. And I''m told by a reputable source that this gun is a shooter. The late Frank de Haas has given this make and model his unique stamp of approval via his excellent book, Bolt Action Rifles. And I don''t have a rifle chambered for 7mm Remington Magnum - which I find to be the second most compelling reason to buy it. The most compelling reason of all, of course, is that I want it.\n\nI guess I really don''t know what it is that makes me love guns so much. I love to make them accurate, I love to shoot them, and I love to carry them in the woods. I love to work on them, fix them if they break, clean them if they''re dirty. I love to admire them, touch them, see how they work. I''ve touched up bluing, built parts from scratch, refinished stocks, and made pistol grips, loving every minute of it. I love guns like some folks love fishing rods, others love cars, and still others go nuts for football. Why? I reckon it really doesn''t matter why we love what we do. We just do, that''s all.\n\nRuss Chastain', ''),

(78690, ' thanks for the welcome!\n\nMy experience today with Chaudry Arms was extremely disappointing, and I''m certain had it not been for the forums here, I would probably have given up on the idea of buying a Gun.\n\nThe sales guy, I think his name was Umar, seemed like a barber sitting in a gun shop since he made 0 effort of selling one. I introduced myself and informed him that I wanted to buy my first gun. He gave me this blank "get lost" look, and so I had to step up a little and let him know I already had a gun in mind, PT 99 and Cougar (he corrected me that its stoeger - he probably didnt know the difference between manufacturer and model).\n\nI asked the price and he said 55K and 50K, for the license he said 15K. I told him that i planned on buying both the gun and license so he should reduce the price, specially for license since i know the going rate is 14K. He kept insisting 15, until I said I''ll have someone else call him who had done it at that price to which he agreed. \nI asked about the two guns etc, and why one could be better than the other in a range etc, and he kept saying "both are same". When I pushed a little on differences he said, I havent fired any gun so I dont know but I''ve heard both are good. He kept pointing at the guns in the shelf and I had to ask him to at least take them out and have me feel them!\n\nSo before I finalize the decision on paying up for the license I asked him to give me a final price on the two pistols and he said, first you put money and license in front of me and then we negotiate. I told him thats a good way for me to go to other shops and he''s not doing a great sales job. He said, 1K lower than the price the others offer you. \n\nIts left a bad taste, and I definitely dont want to buy from these guys. I''d like to go to a dealer who can guide me as a first time buyer and enthusiast. Dealing with the sales guy here reminded me of a government office! Need help!', ''),

(78700, ' TT-33 bro: \nI have fired over 1200 rounds of POF ammo in the last two months, both of 1z and 2z types, from different pistols (none from any Taurus pistol though). There have been only one misfire and around 10 failures to feed, which in proportion is not very alarming and does not really reflect bad of an ammo brand. Most of these stoppages occurred during initial few rounds fired from different NIB pistols. If I may ask, how many rounds have you fired with your gun yet? IMO, 2 stoppages out of initial 20 or 30 bullets are too less to positively determine whether the fault is due to ammo or gun. And I would also suggest that firing POF 2Z ammo with Taurus guns may preferably be avoided. May be if you fire more, the problem would be over. \nregards', ''),

(78755, ' On December 9, 1942, after the start of World War II, KA-BAR submitted a fighting knife to the United States Marine Corps in hopes that it would become general issue to that branch of the military. Working in conjunction with the Marine Quartermaster Department a design was devised and soon production was under way on a new and improved fighting / utility knife for the Marines. As the war escalated, the demand for these knives was so great that the KA-BAR factory alone could not keep up. The government assigned several knife companies to create similar knives as supplemental pieces for those serving the War. KA-BAR’s wartime production totaled more than 1 million. The KA-BAR knives became so well recognized for their quality and so abundant in number that “Kabar” became the name by which many referred to this knife pattern, regardless of whether the knife was manufactured at the KA-BAR facility.  	\n \nThese knives were depended upon to perform daily tasks such as pounding tent stakes, driving nails, opening ration cans and digging foxholes, not to mention defending lives.\n \nGrowing so in popularity and earning only the greatest respect, the KA-BAR was adopted by not only the Marines, but also the Army, Navy, Coast Guard and Underwater Demolition Teams. Years after World War II, many KA-BARS were unofficially reactivated in the Korean, Vietnam, Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom conflicts.\n \nThe dependability and consistent quality of wartime KA-BARs was the result of constant strict quality control procedures by KA-BAR workers and supervisors as well as the US Marine Corps and Navy Supply inspectors who were assigned to the KA-BAR factory to work along with company personnel to accomplish this goal.\n \nThese high quality standards were maintained in 1976 when production was reintroduced to commemorate the Marine Corps 200th Anniversary of service to the United States. It was then that the original factory in Olean, New York, along with some of its original craftsmen, undertook the job of creating a “full dress model” of the original – a Limited Edition Commemorative that would prove to be most meaningful to the Marines. Using the original blueprints which had been stored in the company archive files, the recreated knife was a true work of art that retained the look, feel and performance of the original battle ready combat knife. The first one of its kind, serialized with the number “1”, was presented to the Commandant of the Corps and was later put on display at the USMC Museum at Quantico.\n \nThe USMC Commemorative was so enthusiastically received that it became obvious that the original KA-BAR Fighting / Utility knife had retained its popularity through the years. The limited production Commemorative was so quickly taken up by the Marines, knife enthusiasts and collectors that KA-BAR decided to return it to regular production in its standard form. With only a few changes made possible by modern technology, the KA-BAR Fighting / Utility Knife was reintroduced.\n \nToday, the original USMC Fighting / Utility Knife remains the first choice for many Marines who choose to carry it as their personal option knife during service. It is also a favorite of adventurers, survivalists, outdoor sportsmen and, of course, knife collectors who know that this knife – this “American Legend” – deserves a place in their collection.\n\n[img]http://www.thompsonoutdoors.com/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/kabarusmcseveninch.jpg[/img]\n\nSource: [url]https://www.kabar.com/famous.jsp[/url]', ''),

BUT, I agree with some of the complaints. I''ve posted earlier also, that when I purchased a Stoeger last year, I tried it out with a mix of different rounds, 5 each of Federal, Russian, and P.O.F. The gun jammed or missed every time, it would be a P.O.F round, and any other novice would have left the gun right there by the dealer, I still hadn''t paid for it, yet I took it! Coz the other 10 rounds went perfectly. Ever since then, I haven''t fed it with the P.O.F ones, though I MUST say, major reason could be that customers do not get the GENUINE ones from P.O.F, at least with a couple of rounds mixed up in the package.\n\nI would therefore suggest, anyone thinking to use the P.O.F ones, especially for S.D, ascertain the credibility of your dealer, also try to have him unpack your packet of rounds from fresh and "sealed" P.O.F consignment, lying in his shop. The round may [b]not[/b] be that bad at all. I live in Wah, and this question inspires me now to go buy a few packs [b]direct[/b] from the factory''s customer services office to really give this round a chance.', ''),

I already have plenty of things to clean at home and even though these and many other items have been free for me, I have never taken them.  On a funny note: I have never owned a .30bore nor have I ever fired a .30bore!!!  I am getting a one off custom piece made over there for me, should be ready in few months.\nOur pricing is on the high side due to the quality of work and materials employed/deployed.  The Beretta''s are 25k regardless of finish, design.  The .30bore with interchangeable parts is 16k and the other one is 12k.

The silver Beretta was sold two hours after I put it back on the shelf... and there were no more.

One casing is POF 2Z 9MM and the other one is Winchester 9MM Luger.

(78967, ' What''s so great about this Sigma clone? The price? Indeed, they''ve managed a true copy as such, yet that''s as far as the similarity in looks is concerned, and I guess nothing more than that! Interesting would be if they''ve maintained the double action only feature, or enabled it for single action? Second, do you still need a few horsepowers to get that trigger done, or has it softened up?\n\nFinally, let me say, with all due respect, I''ve always been of the firm opinion, that if one cannot afford a good car in this country, better take a good, new, solid and original bike, rather than a piece of junk with four wheels, that would ultimately have you pushing around with it by every second street corner. And sometimes, nobody comes forth to give you a hand even! \n\nIn function, I doubt any of these better looking clones could ever come up to even 50% of original, and if they still could, they''ll never come close to even 10% in mental peace for the one with a [b]real need[/b] to have a gun. Now some would perhaps say : "AK, course I wouldn''t take it for SD, only for practice". Well, let me say, regardless of all threads about improvement in local manufacturing of handguns, I still just don''t stand convinced. Anytime, I have held a local gun in my hands, it was like shooting with the eyes closed, fearing either a face full of slide, an eyeball hanging out, or a hand partially blown away! Frankly speaking, don''t let looks befool you!\n\nOne of the more demoralizing things of all about the continued improvements, in the pure [i]aesthetics[/i] of counterfeits, be it this S/W or any other one for that sake, is, that in a couple of years all pleasure and pride of having something original will eventually vanish away in the blue, when, at anytime, in any company, or on any occasion, you do in a proud and self-satisfactory mood, un-holster your genuine thing, only to be promptly faced to one stupid question: "Sir jee, yeh asli hai ya ke  "Darre walla"?\n\nI don''t mean to be lambasting upon our local manufacturers, indeed we have very skilled people, and they should be encouraged genuinely, it''s just that something [i]indigenous[/i] should have been created, and rather than [i]aesthetics[/i] more concentration on [i]metallurgy[/i] and [i]functional[/i] effectiveness should have been struggled for, than the tricky business of trying to give people a false and self-conceived feeling of having a 2 or 300K gun @25K. Why do we take the Chinese with ease and pride? NOT because of [i]aesthetics[/i], only because of fair prices along with [i]smooth functionality[/i] and [i]robust metallurgy[/i].

Unfortunately, I have a personal experience, I forgot to mention above, in that I''m one lucky guy still to have both my eyes! Hammer of a local T.T in my palm at reload time of new mag, should speak for itself! I was lucky it wasn''t pushed back at next fire, but before it, coz it really wouldn''t have been an ideal position at next fire with front sight, rear sight and my eye all in alignment in shooting position! What broke off with the minimal and sheer force of my thumb in pulling it back, would perhaps have caused some serious damage by the recoiling force of slide and hammer at time of fire! Second, a cousin of mine nearly lost parts of his hand in another incident of a total kaboom! I believe that''s experience. [i]Failed metallurgy[/i] seems reason behind both incidents, though [i]aesthetics[/i] were all just fine in both guns!

So how can we question their reliability without knowing ANYTHING about their product? It''s their "Rozi roti". They get the job done, and that''s why they keep producing more and more. Hint: Their products works and is worth the money! \n\nNot only that, they''re providing poor yet skilled people with JOBS in THIS dry economy by going for new projects. I do agree with you on the part about safety but then again, "Ak''s" that are being produced in Darra locally have seen more than one front and their reliability still gives Mikhail Kalashnikov nightmares.\n\nLets not question a weapons reliability until we''ve had some experiences with it ourselves. \n\nRegards[/quote]\n\nBro, I have to agree with AK here. If it''s my life I''m trying to protect, I would always go for the best possible option available with minimal doubt about reliability and quality which my budget allows. Instead of two or three clones, I''ll buy one quality weapon. If I still don''t have the money, I''ll wait till I have the money and in the meantime, buy Daudsons 12g pump action, which is the only Pakistani weapon, I would be willing to trust.\n\nI''ve read some say that we use clones for practice. I personally think that one should practice with the same gun with which he intends to defend himself when the need arises.\n\nIn the end, considering the fact that our local production is not institutionalized and standardized, I would rate our local clones as simply a hit or miss, with the miss carrying too high a risk for me to take.\n\nRegarding your point "They get the job done, and that''s why they keep producing more and more". Pak Suzuki also keeps producing more and more Mehran. Doesn''t make it a good car. It remains a piece of crap on four wheels. And yes, I owned one and drove it daily for four long torturous years and despite the fact that I maintain my things very well, this car kept giving me severe headaches. Poor quality and low reliability. Ofcourse, it came dirt cheap compared to others. After four years, I ditched it and got myself a Hyundai Santro Exec, which I still have as a second car after 4.5 years with ZERO problems (FTFs/FTEs).', ''),

If this is excessive it results in shots being pulled as the grip and pressure due to the trigger pull is suddenly released, while the round is still in the barrel or your follow through is not consistant.\nTo adjust it we tighten the back lash screw till the gun cannot be fired when the trigger is pulled, then with finger pressure on the trigger of  a cocked ( unloaded ) pistol or rifle  we gradually and slowly unscrew till the gun fires at this point we unscrew further by half a turn and your backlashh is adjusted. \n\nYou can see the instructions of your Anshutz manual, this is valid for match grade Rifles and pistols and also quality  rifles.

Any how modern day firearm barrels are cold hammer forged and some manufactures are also hammer forging the chamber.\n\nA terrific barrel can be made of either a 4140-type chrome-moly or 416-type stainless. 4140 type chrome-moly is less expensive and a little easier to machine but 416 type stainless has longer accuracy life and is more corrosion resistant. \n\nSo don’t worry about using different imported brands, each barrel mostly has it’s life span of over 20000 rounds. I don’t think majority is going to fire 20000 rounds from each gun, though most barrels will go way beyond their life span if properly cleaned and maintained after every shooting session.\n\nI won’t recommend local made ammo to be used on regular bases though.', ''),

More parts equal more chances for something to go wrong. Solid steel mounts are the strongest, but in many cases, aluminum will serve perfectly well.

(79259, ' So you have weight problem? \nA hunter must be fit in all aspects of his health. Anechdotly, a hunter should be able to walk 3 miles with 10 Kg on his back. \n                    Weight is a common world wide problem. Although, women are more conscious being over weight than men, yet they share the common adverse consequences of obesity such as heart attack, high blodd pressure, diabetes, arthritis, and social acceptance.\n              Although, weight contorl is not an easy task but with education and some counceling plus medicne , it is not that imposible. In fact it is just easy once you are determined to loose weigh. It is all in the attitude. \n               Human body is a miracle and a perfectugh tough machine lasting 60- 80 years if you can control your weight, do not smoke and can control your stress. A lean person not only looks good but can handle every day stress much easier, and  a tough hunter  can chase its game much better than the overweight hunter. Now, i am not being insolent to those who have weight problem but like to help. \n                  i am in my late 50''s yet I can out run and out play young people, can run or jog 3 miles per day and hardly have anay physical problem. Having said that, let usdiscuss  how can we control our problem?\n                Body is made out of 75% water and 25% matter. Biggest organ in our body is skin and under neath tucked in fuel tank or fat reserve. we inherit fat cells from our incestry and that can not be changed but we can change or control our body fat inatke. The at cells are like sponges that absorbs extra fat and release the fat on demand. \n          Surprisingly, it is not just the fat that we consume that contribute our obesity but starchy food like rice, bread, sugar, patato, certain kind of vegitables with high sugar contents. Anything with carbohydrate which if over consumed will convert into fat under men''s belly and in the rear of women. \n              Nature made our body to run, walk, after food gathering and not to ride cars just go to the next door neighbor''s house to be presented with sweets or Desi Ghee Ki Metthie. Desi Ghee is number one enemy of the body , yet we Pakistani revere it. Stop the ghee, oil, fried food and starch, you just stop being over weight. Add some exercise like walking, swiming, stair climbing or just go for shikar. \n   Start out with just 15 minutes non stop exercise first and gradualy increase it as your body will tell you. In the begning you won''nt loose weight for at leat one month but do n''t be discouraged. This is a body defense system from keeping you starving your self to death. Add lots of  green vegitables in your diet, decrese you meat inatke except wild game meat. Shikar is the best meat for human being becasue that what our incesters ate.  Wild animals are runner and you wont see them riding on motor cycles or Jeeps. The reason that wild birds do not have enormous fat built in because they consumed it as a fuel very rapidly. Ducks have to fly twice a year covering a distance of 1200 Km one way. for this reason,  just before they migrate the ate 24 hours to accumulate fat in their body to go back and that is why you see them gaining weight at the end odfthe winter when they just ready to return.\n               In humen, only four muscles use fat as energy and that are you arms and legs other organs do use fat but in minute quantity or none at all. Brain can not use fat as a fuel but small amount of carbohydrtes, and that is even convetred to glucose before brain can use. \n               Just like your hunting vehicles, human needs patrol too. Our fuel come in high and low octane. Ghee is a crude patrol low octnae, but carbohydrate and protein is high octane and refined fuel for our body. fat yield abou 8 calories per gm, but protein and cabohydrates produces 4 calories per gm. Protein does not convert into fat but carbohydartes do and in excess it jams into under thye skin as a reserve and that is what contribute to weight. Once the sugar or carbohydrates convert into fat, it can not transform  into sugar again.\n              An ideal weight for 5 feet person is only 50 Kgs plus 7-10 kgs for every extra inch. this means if you are 5'' 5" then your ideal weight should be 75-100 Kgs.  By decresng oil or ghee consumption , you will also reduce your total chlostrol also. And if you excercise and drink lots of simple water your good clostrol (HDL) will increae which will protect you from heart and stroke problems.\n              I treat over weight pts. with diet and excercise and some I had to put on certain medicine which supress their appatite but these medicne are highly addictive and person has to be monitor very closely for the side effects.\n\nGood Luck', ''),

I told Denovo, Imu10, Sohail and Taurus in person today how the video could be caught in so many ways. Here goes,\n\n1). The big and most obvious giveaway was how slowly the Camry over took trucks and other cars, keep in mind that on the motorway the average speed for the center lane is 110 kms ! If you go 125 kms you will over take 90 % of the traffic.\n\n2). The second BIG giveaway was the RPM which I show again and again in the video. 240 kms at a 3.75 RPM, that is a feat Ferrrari would be proud off ! :lol: Anything touching 200 kms in modern cars will be in red zone in the RPM. I.e 7/8000 RPM.\n\n3). And the final and most exact calculation to which speed I was actually going was when I deliberately show the TRIP meter at  296 KMS at the start of the video (0:15 to 0:30) and again show it at 303kms (2:40) in the ending of the video. The video is exactly 3:05 secs long on Youtube so with a little simple Maths of 7Kms in 3 mins gives us an exact speed of 140 kms per hour :)\n\nI thought our PakGuns boys who are used to seeing/noticing the minute details on firearms while evaluating them would pick up on all these things in under a couple of hours.  \n\nJust a little lesson, don''t go on what''s written on the slide (SuperCharged Glock) :) look a little deeper and see if the Austrians really made such an item or is it made in a factory in Daara.', ''),

(79419, ' [quote=Glxspk]Kidnappings are on the rise in NWFP & upper punjab. If you think you might be a catch pls take the following precautions:\n\n1. Avoid commuting in expensive cars & SUVs.\n2. If you own an expensive cell phone use a handsfree to talk on it in public. You accessories(watch, cellphone etc.) gives out a lot about what you are.\n3. There mostly an insider involved so be wary of giving out personal information like office timings, working hours, places you go to at a given time & on a given day, your financial standing, your profits, quoting prices of items of interest in your pocession and the like. Only provide information on a need to know basis. For the brevity of it: Keep you eyes open & you mouth shut.\n4. If your work requires visiting a bank on a regular basis, make good terms with the manager and handle all transactions from his room. Do not take cash at cash counters. Keep changing the times & days that you visit a bank.\n5. Be unpreditable in every action. Do not keep fixed timings & use same routes. Art of war is based upon deception.\n6. If you have an enemity, most cultures in our region will not attack you if you have a third person with you. They wouldnt want another enemity if they hurt another person. Always keep a friend with you when you go out.\n7. Keep a weapon. Always. And when you do and you travel alone mostly never let anyone know under any circumstances that you own one. Detente doesnnt apply to kidnapping for ransom when your travelling or commuting without a personal security detail. If they want to kidnap you they will kidnap you and if they know you might be armed their primary objective would be to get you unarmed by all means which is likely to turn voilent. \n8. Most kidnappings in upper punjab takes place on the highways & motor ways. Keep your eyes on the view mirrors. Keep a good safe distance from all approaching vehicles. Kidnappers usually use two vehicles and try to squeeze you into stopping from front & rear. Almost all of them use 95-98 model Toyota Corrollas. If you see two speeding cars approaching your vehicle and the instant they''re near you, change the lane and slow down and let them pass. They''ll panic and will blow their intention and you''ll have a cushion and space to get out. If you have a weapon, I would prefer a machine pistol at that time or a handy pump action, FIRE at them & get away. 99% of them will not come after you. SHOTGUNS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS IN CLOSE QUARTER ENGAGEMENTS. Learn how to load ammo with one hand esp when driving.\n9. Do not go to collect cash payments.\n10. Do not meet unknown people. I was lured and invited to a business deal in Bahawalpur and was kidnapped.\n11. NEVER accept drinks & food at a strange place by strange people. Keep a LIVE chambered rounds when you anticipate things to escalate.\n12. If confronted with a situation, be offensive VERY offensive & ruthless but retreat IMMEDIATELY when they dont expect you to. Shock & Awe.\n13. Your children & family members are the kidnappers primary target. Your drivers & servants are usually the primary sources of information. Always drop & pickup your children from the school. The timings would be fixed so keep changing the routes. Make sure your children know home addresses & your telephone numbers and of your friends  family. Make sure your children know the way to home. They should know how to hire a taxi or riskshaw. Do drills with them for different kind of situations. IMPORTANT: Your servants should be SHIT scared of you. So scared that they''d wet their clothes. This again works for a repellent. Have copies of their ID cards. Home addresses. Addresses of their close relatives, every one of them. Know the ISDN number of the mobile phone sets that they use. Never trust anyone. Keep them well paid and have them trust & love you as well. Dont talk about financial matters in their presence. Do not make cash transactions in their presence and let them have an approximation of your net worth.\n14. If you think you are eligible enough to be kidnapped, you can afford a personal security detail as well. Try not to hire personnel from security companies. They CANNOT be trusted. With all due respect, esp the tribals because they are unpredictable. Never let two guards have good relations or friendly terms with the other. Always make sure theyre against the other. This can be accomplished by keeping guards from different ethnicities esp ethnicities which are at loggerheads with the other. Pair them up if they have different political idealogies. You know inside out. Never hire two guards from the same security company. Keep changing them regularly. \n15. Never let you kid trust your servants of security guards. Tell your kids to panic & start shouting once they see an unusualy situation or an unusual route.\n\nNever ever neglect or takes things easy or give any one an opportunity against you. Always be prepared.[/quote]\nHelpful Info. Sorry to see the BAN.', ''),

In just one short year we''ve mushroomed to become the "[b]Largest Pakistan Specific Firearms Database in the World[/b]". If anyone needs to know anything about firearms in Pakistan, we are it. What is more fascinating is that we''ve managed to hold [b]12 major get together''s in just 12 months in all the major cities of Pakistan ![/b] Five including tonight''s in Karachi, Four in Lahore, Two in Islamabad, One in Peshawar and One in Multan. Also apart from major gtg''s, minor ones have been numerous. \n \nMany new friends have joined us this past year and some old ones gone, it is all a part of community building. Anyone that is pretentious, a show off or self serving will not fit in and quickly run out of favor at PakGuns. Our goal is to build such a community where members really care for each other and go out of their way to help them. We have always maintained and will maintain that no one, no matter how integrated or important is above the community as a whole and anyone seeking to disrupt or create divisions will be cut off. There is no place for groupings here, we are all ''ONE'' group.\n\nInshAllah many things are planned for our second year, we are seriously considering among others two ventures.\n\n1). Our own magazine and a blog.\n\n2). An organization/society focused on promoting the safe use of firearms for sport and hunting in Pakistan. The organization will consist of Senior PakGuns members who will be invited in person to participate. \n\nOn an ending note, I would specially like to thank a couple of members whose help and support with PakGuns has been invaluable. These members [i]are[/i] PakGuns and have spent their time, money and considerable effort to further the cause of PakGuns which they understand so well. It''s dedicated people like these that will turn the face of this sport around in Pakistan InshAllah.\n\n@Kamran, Sohail, Saleem & Imran. You guys rock.\n\nWish all PakGunners the best of everything always, InshAllah we will grow and learn much together in years to come.', ''),

PakGuns is all about help, knowledge, respect and honesty. I am amazed in this world of selfishness how peoples from different cities, who don’t know each other, respect and treat as they are familiar from years. where ever we go a fellow pak gunner welcomes us. Its true spirit of the brother hood.\nIt’s a great effort to teach our brothers about the sport of braves: “guns” and “hunting”. I salute to the mind of that gentleman who provided us such opportunity to avail information about our hobby and passion. Guns were not liked in our average society, thinking them the tools of terror and danger, used by thugs badmashs and criminals.. But we forgot the other side of the picture in this propaganda spread by some “unknown” diplomats of darkness.\nThanks to pakGuns we are succeeded to convey our message that guns are for your defence and sports. its the must have of MEN and braves, and we are ordered by Allah to have them.\nWe the members of pak guns condemn the illegal use of arms in what so ever form. we condemn aerial firing. we condemn show off the guns to impress the citizens.\nWhat we do is all keep them for SD/HD and sports, and when ever our motherland will call us we will be with our Army and LEAs to defend our country.\nI really appreciate the support of our Admin Mods and other senior members to keep going our forum and they provide us their precious time from their life.\n\n[img]http://fc05.deviantart.com/fs18/f/2007/140/b/a/Happy_Birthday_by_julieannejones.jpg[/img]\n[b]LONG LIVE PAKISTAN\nLONG LIVE PAKGUNS[/b]', ''),

(79615, ' @AOA\n\nNo worries mate. Ur Cougar seems to be original, I will say 100% based on my observation. For your peace of mind I tried to find some differences in the replica Cougar and the Original Cougar. It’s much easier when one has both the guns in hand and then compares the replica and the original. But with pix it’s different story. I M not at home but I had the high resolution pic of my Cougar which helped me find out the difference between Replica and the Original. As replica is replica their needs to be some difference. \n\nI would like to mention here that the guy producing replicas have done a good job. It took me really hard to find out the difference. I have compared ur Cougar with the Replica  Cougar pix posted on the forum. My Cougar pic was the main source of recognizing the difference.  \n\nHere we go following are the 3 Differences:\n\n[b]First Pic down below is my Cougar, 2nd one is ur Cougar and the 3rd one is the Replica Cougar.[/b]\n\n\n[b]1st Difference:[/b]\n\nLook closely on my Cougar and Ur Cougar pix, the writings |under ejection port [b]”STOEGER COUGAR 8000”[/b] goes beyond the ejection port while on Replica Cougar this writing is just below with in the ejection port it doesn’t go beyond the ejection port. See Red Circle marked around [b]“8000” [/b]on original Cougar it goes way ahead below ejection port.\n\n\n[b]2nd Difference:[/b]\n\nOn Original Cougar we have two writings, one on slide and then one on frame. The writing on slide states [b]“WARNING:RETRACT SLIDE TO SEE IF LOADED. FIRES WITHOUT MAGZINE”[/b]  \n\nAnd the writing on frame states [b]“READ MANUAL BEFORE USE”[/b] \n\nCarefully observe both the writings, U will notice that on original Cougar the 1st word on frame [b]“READ”[/b] just starts below in between the words on slide [b]“IF LOADED”[/b]. See the marked Red Circles. While on Replica Cougar the same word [b]“READ” [/b]starts just below the word [b]“SEE”[/b] on slide. I have seen all the pix of Replica Cougar posted and that difference is the same on all replicas.\n\n[b]3rd Difference:[/b]\n\nThe finish of the plastic grip on ur Cougar and the replica Cougar is quite visible. The replica one is of poor quality and I have seen this difference on all replicas of mostly all the replica guns produced in Pak.\n\nThis is what I can find with the available pictures without holding or examining replica gun. Hope this is of some help.\n\n[b]My Cougar:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqv8quA][img]http://s3.postimage.org/v8quA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]AOA ur Cougar:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts1epiUS][img]http://s2.postimage.org/1epiUS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Replica Cougar:[/b]\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxRvfqi][img]http://s1.postimage.org/Rvfqi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[b]Link to the Replica Cougar Thread:[/b]\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3274[/url]', ''),

(79617, ' @AOA.........First about the "silvery line". Well, it''s not quite noticeable on the picture, but, in my opinion, if there''s anything "silvery" on the visible rotating barrel, it''s quite normal, especially if you''ve been out firing and your gun is no more NIB. I also wondered about this in the beginning, but the best of my logic says, that this "silvery" thing will increase with increased use, coz it''s a moving part and course there will be some fading, flaking of color here, the more "seasoned" the gun gets. I may be wrong, but I expect such even from my own gun.\n\nSecond, about the "cut", well, bear in mind that your sight is "interchangeable", we may not have here in Pakistan, but in the states, there are [i]after sales[/i] sights, like the "trijicons" that you can have placed here in lieu of the standard ones. I believe this cut is for the gunsmith to work on when replacing/changing of sights.

(79684, ' Here''s an online review of the 945\n\n[quote]\n[url]http://www.thehighroad.org/showpost.php?p=560705&postcount=1[/url]\n\nThe Taurus is basically a Beretta design in .45, which is something I always wanted. It''s an 8+1 DA/SA gun, ported with ambi controls. Again, a good deal at a local shop convinced me to separate cash from wallet. This one ran $399 with 3 mags, nib. Sights are white 3-dot combat style, rear is adjustable by wrench.\n\nPros: The Taurus PT945 is very well balanced, feels good and points naturally. So far, it''s been extremely reliable and accurate. It''s digested 20 different brands of 45, mixed in mags and has never had a hiccup. Going on 1000 rounds, it''s been perfect. The porting really helps muzzle control, makes recoil very manageable and the fit/finish of the pistol is exceptional, no machining marks or ugly parts to speak of. Unlike many guns, the angle of feed is nearly straight-on, and the feed ramp is polished and smooth. The gun eats HP/SP/FMJ with equal aploomb. The trigger is decent, smooth and a nice letoff. Good for a combat pistol.\n\n[b][color=red]Cons:[/color][/b] The porting, while serving it''s purpose has a very negative side effect in that it throws burnt powder into the front sight, completely erasing the white dot, so much so infact that the dot can''t be cleaned - it''s gone. I have to apply white-out before shooting each time, but after 20 rounds it''s obscured and completely black. Also, the porting obviously makes cleaning the slide and barrel much more difficult, but that''s to be expected. The only other downside is the grips are very thin, very cheap feeling plastic ones. A finger groove Hogue rubber wraparound would be sooo nice but none is made IIRC. Taurus makes a contoured wood, but I don''t like wood on a service piece so I''ll live with what I have for now.\n\nOverall, I''m thrilled with the gun. It''s ideal and shoots as well if not better than my Sig220, with much less recoil. For the money, I''d say it''s one of the nicest .45''s on the market.[/quote]', ''),

(79702, ' Something relevant to share with everyone:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[u][b]BECOMING A MARKSMAN WITH A PISTOL[/b][/u]\n\nIt is quite possible to be very accurate over long distances with a pistol. It takes patience, a little bit of talent, dexterity, and lots of practice. This article will give you pointers on how to become a better shot with any pistol at distances of 100 yards, 200 yards, and beyond. Keep in mind (especially with handguns) you may limit how well you are able to accomplish this based on the amount of trigger-time and patience you put into your exercises.\n\n[b]1 - Choose a good pistol. [/b]\n\nThough any pistol can be wielded better, the weapon can seriously limit the ultimate success of being a marksman with your pistol. Here are some generalities to look at when purchasing a weapon. The generalities deal with single-shot, long-range accuracy; this is not including considerations like self defense, durability, or price. None of these are concrete as there are exceptions to all of them, and a pistol that fits you personally is always the best choice.\n\n          * Larger pistols are more accurate than smaller ones.\n          * Larger pistols will fit more peoples'' hands than smaller ones.\n          * Longer barrels mean higher muzzle velocities which mean flatter bullet trajectories.\n          * Lighter, high-velocity bullets are more accurate at common pistol ranges (out to 50+ yards).\n          * Heavy bullets are more accurate at longer ranges (100+ yards).\n          * Smaller calibers are cheaper to shoot, which means you can practice more.\n          * Smaller calibers mean less recoil, which in turn mean faster follow-up shots, or more people can comfortably shoot it.\n          * For semi-automatic pistols, double-action only (DOA) (AKA Quick Action) pistols are less accurate than double/single-action (DA/SA) or single-action (SA).\n          * Expensive guns aren''t necessarily accurate or shoot well often due to limits of the user.\n          * Your gun is more accurate than you are.\n\n[b]2.[/b] So from the generalities above, a large SA (or DA/SA) pistol with a long barrel would be best. \n\n[b]3.[/b] While a public shooting range is a common place to practice, it is not necessarily the most optimal location to practice your long-range accuracy. A friend with lots of land and a safe place to shoot is often best. This allows you to setup custom distances to targets and become adept at any range with any size target.\n\n[b]4.[/b] Start your practice out with some stretches. This sounds really weird, but it will loosen your muscles and allow you to have more steady hands and body.\n   \n[b]5.[/b] Do some warm-up shots (maybe at 15 yards). Find where you (and your gun) are shooting. If you find yourself not able to keep consistent groupings at this range, practice shooting very slowly and being patient until your sights move over your target. Once you figure out where your sights are compared to where you are shooting (optimally, the bullet should end up in line with your front sight, but hopefully slightly above it – if you know how far off you are, a gun smith can likely correct your sights) you can continue to the practice you came for.\n   \n[b]6.[/b] When you first start shooting at long-distance targets, it is best to start closer and move your way up. A good starting distance is about 25 yards. Though this is much further than most people are used to, if you are going to be good at long range, you must practice at long range. When you start you may find yourself unable to hit a body-sized target consistently, but over time you will find you can hit cans 90% of the time at this range.\n   \n[b]7.[/b] Your stance should be what is most comfortable to you. It is often best to (if you are right handed) to place your left foot forward, and about shoulder-length diagonally behind that, your right foot. Bring your right hand straight forward as if you are attempting to touch the target, keep your elbow loose, but close to lock; this is the hand that will hold the grip of the gun. Your left arm will be bent at about a 120 degree angle. Your right arm controls the vertical angle of the gun; your left arm controls the horizontal position. You left elbow should be about pointed directly at the ground.\n          \n* Prone: You need to practice lying on the ground. Your stance on the ground should be such: lay on your belly. Then roll slightly to the firing side. Place your support knee and elbow down on the ground. You will be a bit sideways, but your firing arm will be completely flush with the ground with your head resting on it looking down the sights. This allows burden-free breathing and a very stable platform.\n          \n* Crouching: This can give you a very stable platform for shooting accurately. Put your firing leg behind you and essentially sit down on the heel of your foot. Your firing knee will be on the ground and your toe. Rest your support elbow on your support knee. You are in a tripod position (support foot, firing toe and firing knee), and you are in an arrangement where you can move quickly (practice moving periodically to and from the crouching position).\n   \n[b]8.[/b] Lean your head slightly to the right to line up your right eye with the sights of the gun. You may need to move your right wrist to adjust the sights to point forward. To aim, move your body (in this stance) until the gun lines up with the target.\n   \n[b]9.[/b] Slowly breathe, relax, and attempt to lineup the sights over the target. For target shooting, it is often best to overlay the front sight on your intended target, while focusing on the front sight, or somewhere in between the target and your front sight (this should only be used if you have ample time to aim). Do not focus on the target; focus near the front sight, concentrating all of your mind on creating a perfect "sight picture" where the rear sight and front site line up completely. The target should be a blur beyond your firearm. If speed is an issue: 99% of the time it would be best to focus completely on your front sight.\n  \n[b]10.[/b] You will find with practice that your breathing and ability to not get excited and remain calm are the primarily challenges when keeping your sights on your target. This can only be overcome with practice. Breathe in and out normally before shooting, then take a slightly deeper breath before exhaling completely and relaxing your lungs. It is during this relaxation point (*not* forcing air out, just relaxing) that your shot should be taken.\n  \n[b]11.[/b] The "sight picture" should, on traditional iron sights, resemble a shape like III, where the front sight is framed perfectly by the borders of the rear site. Keep in mind this means horizontal as well as vertical! This perfect picture should then be placed below the target (not obscuring it) and the gun should then be fired.\n  \n[b]12.[/b] A gun should be ''zeroed'' (adjusted) to aim accurately when the sight picture is placed directly below the target. It is in this manner that making artificial adjustments (e.g., aiming left or high) is avoided and a gun aimed straight and true to a perfectly aligned sight picture will deliver a round to the desired target accurately.\n  \n[b]13.[/b] Different ammunition shoots differently (and more or less accurately) for different guns. Try various types for your firearm and determine which groups best for your gun.\n  \n[b]14.[/b] Novice shooters often pride themselves on a bullseye when the rest of their shots lie all over the target. Even a handful of marbles thrown at the target will probably hit here and there; this doesn''t demonstrate skill, only luck. Concentrate on grouping your shots close together; this is the first sign of an effective marksman and demonstrates consistency in shooting.\n  \n[b]15.[/b] Once you have the sights correctly aligned and have placed a perfect sight picture on your target, you want to slowly pull the trigger directly toward the back of the gun, with the trigger on or past the last joint on your index finger (pull straight, slowly, and consistently between shots). With a DA/SA pistol, you should have already pulled the hammer back (it is now in SA mode). Based on the gun, you may have anywhere between a 2 and 8 lb pull. The lighter the trigger, the easier it is to be accurate (though with DAO pistols, there is a "sweet spot" that can be found to reduce the trigger pull; find it by firing a shot, without releasing the trigger; slowly move your finger forward until the trigger clicks, you can then pull the trigger again to fire).\n  \n[b]16.[/b] When the shot fires see where the bullet landed (high, low, left, right, or any combination). This may take some practice, but you will be able to determine if the shot missed because the sights aren''t lined up, your arm was swaying and/or your timing was off, or you anticipated the shot.\n          \n* When a shot lands left of the target for a right-handed person, it means they are squeezing the whole gun instead of just the trigger when they are firing.\n          \n* When a shot lands right of the target for a right-handed person, it means they either have too much finger on the trigger or they are pushing in with their grip-fingers on the firing hand.\n          \n* Shots very seldom land high, but when they do, it sometimes means the shooter is anticipating the recoil and pull up before a shot.\n          \n* If a shot lands low, it is often because the shooter is either mashing the trigger (gripping the trigger and the gun, and pulling too quickly) or more likely because they are anticipating the recoil and thus pushing down on the gun before it actually fires.\n          \n* Anticipating the recoil is one of the most common reasons a person cannot shoot a gun accurately. The person will expect the gun to recoil, so before the round has fired, they will move their wrist, pointing the gun down or up, depending on the shooter. A very easy way to identify this is by handing the person a gun they are very familiar with. Make sure it is unloaded, but tell them it is loaded. When they line up their shot, and pull the trigger, they will move the gun themselves.\n          \n* To break this habit, here are a few techniques.\n                \n-----o The simplest is to concentrate on your trigger pull. Point in to the target and slowly pull the trigger. Just keep building pressure as slowly and evenly as you can. It could take up to 10 seconds for the gun to fire. The purpose is to get a "surprise break" meaning that you don''t know when the gun is going to fire, thus you can''t compensate for it. A gun with a smooth trigger and a crisp break are more likely to prevent this situation as you are less likely to feel when the gun is going to fire as your pull the trigger.\n                \n-----o The second technique is essentially the same, except it removes all possibility of the user anticipating the recoil. Point in to the target and keep your front sight on the target as best you can. Have a friend put their finger in the trigger guard and pull the trigger for you (either your finger on the index point, or on the trigger under their finger). Make sure the person actually doing the pulling does it very slowly and keeps their hand (mainly their thumb) away from the back of the gun (where the slide will clip them). This method is very awkward, but it will prove that trigger pull is one of the most important elements in firing a gun.\n                \no Many shooters, even experienced ones, flinch without realizing it. Anticipating the recoil can manifest itself as subtle movements that are masked by the actual recoil of the gun, and therefore go unnoticed by the shooter or observers. You can easily test this using a snap cap [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_cap.[/url] As stated in the link,\n\n“A snap cap is a device which appears similar to a standard firearm cartridge but contains no primer or projectile and is used to dry fire the weapon. Snap caps usually contain a spring-dampened false primer which absorbs the force from the firing pin allowing you to safely test-fire the gun without damaging the components.”\n\n                + Have a friend load your gun for you, but replacing one loaded round with a snap cap of the same caliber, positioned in the magazine (for a pistol) or cylinder (for a revolver) at random. As you proceed to fire all rounds, you’ll eventually find the snap cap, but you won’t know it until after you’ve pulled the trigger. At that moment, it will be obvious to you – If your site picture is rock steady, you’ve mastered the weapon’s recoil. If the gun jumps in your hand like a live round just went off, you need more practice. This is a simple, inexpensive test, but the results may surprise you.\n\n[b]17.[/b] Practice at this range until you consistently are able to hit a chest-sized target (about a 20-inch diameter circle). Move the target back about 10 yards. Practice the cycle again. Maintain constant breathing patterns. If your sights are off, get new ones put on to compensate, or have a gun smith fix the current ones. The 3-dot sight system is my preference, but some people prefer different style sights. Adjustable sights also make it easy to change the zero-point on your gun at any point.\n          \n* After you move the target back a time or two more, you will find that you are able to practice and eventually be able to consistently hit that chest-sized target at further and further distances.\n          \n* At some point, go back to the close target, and impress yourself at how well you are able to make tight groupings. This way you give yourself more confidence as you are able to see marked improvement.\n   \n[b]18.[/b] If your sights hit in the correct location (not high or low) at 40 or 50 yards (this is best), you will find that at 60 or 70 yards you will need to compensate for bullet drop by aiming higher; it may only be a couple inches, but you will need to get used to it.\n          \n* At 100 yards there is significant bullet drop (about 10-15 inches for a standard .45), and wind becomes a bit of a factor. While standing you may find you can go further than 100 yards. Push yourself and find your limit. While prone our crouching with a support, you will find you can land consistent shots out to 200 yards.\n                \no Terminal ballistic abilities at 200 or more yards for the most common pistol are questionable. At very long distances heavier bullets hold a greater percentage of their energy due to aerodynamic coefficients.\n\nFurther additions to the above:\n\n- Every sport has "follow-through" and sports shooting is no exception. As you pull the trigger (at a consistent speed), after the gun goes off continue to pull the trigger until it stops, then release and prepare for the next shot. This follow-through action improves accuracy and reduces shot-to-shot variation, just as follow-through does for a golfer or a tennis player.', ''),

As you mentioned me moving parts of body, I deliberately told you that I do not. I only blink. A soft eye blink after the shot has fired, not before it because I do see my muzzle climb and slide retraction. I''ve dry fired alot to verify my rock solid sights on target. Also I''ll tell you that I dont wear ear muffs, this is to simulate real shooting. \nNow my question was, do we unlearn skills?, I shoot once a month minimum and thrice a month at max and been doing that off and on for last 3 years. It was only in the very start that I used to flinch just like any other new shooter. Lately I had developed command on blinking as well. But this time I started it again. So how frequent you think one should shoot, still more than I am currently managing to. Is blinking a hard thing to overcome, harder than flinch? \nTo mention a bit more for other readers, I''ve come across comments of USPSA shooters who''ve been shooting alot and still find themselves blinking.', ''),

The first one had been secured earlier and at lower rates. Second, sometimes your agent runs out of "quota arrangement" from his own sources, forcing him to ask some other agent for a favor to complete pending applications. This is when one more hand get''s involved and thereby another 2K or so.

(79896, ' [quote=midreestaj][quote=Skeeter60]Idrees Sab \nDry fire, Dry fire and ball and dummy with a friend and you will over come this problem known as " Blinking" you must also be moving some parts of your body along with it.  Ball and dummy is a good cure, you should not know whether there is a round in the chamber or not? Do it only on the range please and always treat the gun as loaded[/quote]\n\nSir I agree with you and it would be wrong to say that ball and dummy with dry firing ain''t an effective and tested method to cure flinch.\nBut in the symptoms of flinch, a sub category known to us as blinking is something that accompanies it, yet it can be the only symptom found in a shooter other than full flinch. As you mentioned me moving parts of body, I deliberately told you that I do not. I only blink. A soft eye blink after the shot has fired, not before it because I do see my muzzle climb and slide retraction. I''ve dry fired alot to verify my rock solid sights on target. Also I''ll tell you that I dont wear ear muffs, this is to simulate real shooting. \nNow my question was, do we unlearn skills?, I shoot once a month minimum and thrice a month at max and been doing that off and on for last 3 years. It was only in the very start that I used to flinch just like any other new shooter. Lately I had developed command on blinking as well. But this time I started it again. So how frequent you think one should shoot, still more than I am currently managing to. Is blinking a hard thing to overcome, harder than flinch? \nTo mention a bit more for other readers, I''ve come across comments of USPSA shooters who''ve been shooting alot and still find themselves blinking.[/quote]\n\n@MIDREESTAJ\n\nIt is not hard to overcome if you do the ball and dummy on a daily basis for a couple of weeks. Once a problem has been identified, in my opinion it is as good as erradicated.  With your motivation and desire to shoot well you can overcome this problem easily. \nIn my more than 45 years experience of shooting and training shooters I have found the Ball and Dummy as the best ego breaker. It immediately tells the shooter and the coach where the problem lies.\nThe results are important; if you blink and yet shoot 2 inch groups with an acurate pistol at 25 meters; you do not have a problem. \nLet some experienced friend accompany you on your ball and Dummy excercises and he will tell you what you are doing. If your groups are are bigger than 6 inches at 25 m then my friend you are not only making a come along sweet heart wink but also moving.', ''),
(79897, ' @Rameez..........I must say you have a choice for some of the"odder" types of guns. CM-9, Zigana, 809, MC21 all are some of the fewer used guns amongst our members. Whu don''t you go for something more traditional, reliable, resale-able? Honstly, I cannot suggest you anything but a Viking MP446, Stoeger Cougar, Taurus 909, or CZ-999.\n\nIf, however, you still opt for something odd, well, then try to look out for the "Tanfoglio force", 9mm handgun. It''s a clone of the CZ-75, an Italian make, yet assembled in Philippines by Armscor. A reliable handgun, beautiful, squarish as you desire, high cap mag, and even got the tactical rails to it. I''m sure you''d like it, if I was to go for another 9mm now, I''d for sure take it any given day, provided it''s available. In fact, I wouldn''t rush into any deal, but try to look around for it a few more days, even order it, if possible and wait a bit longer, before I take any of those things you mention above. Let me see, if I''ve a pic of it in my database.\n\nThis is the Standard version:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts1ipAN9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/1ipAN9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nThis is the Compact version:\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts1ipFMr][img]http://s2.postimage.org/1ipFMr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nRameez, above models are not displayed [b]with rails[/b]. The one we''ve in Pakistan is with rails and looks even better than those above. This was just for you idea.\n\nI had better and totally "mouthwatering" pics of this gun in my database, but seems like they''ve been deleted somehow. Basically, as you''d notice, it''s a CM-9, yet this an Italian product, whereas the other one is a Turkish. I''d for sure take the Tanfoglio between these two. I suggested you this gun only because you seem to have a choice for the more rare ones. Otherwise, look at the other options above. Hope to have helped you fairly. Regards.', ''),

This bullet will have 90 ft. lbs energy at 150mtr enough to take down rabit or duck. This wonder rim fire gives you supper flat trajectory and extends the effective range of .22WMR from 125 mtrs to 145-150 mtrs.

Soon you will find kids abiding by the lesson given by his elder figure. Kids live in the world of fiction, fantasies and once they hold the gun so many images come  in their mind and they simulate the situation to original life Their playing involve certain active roles, so if some thing good is taught to them they will try to copy it while playing, from the same point the nature starts developing and certain principles of gun safety becomes the second nature.\nAir gun handling reqires supervision and its better to make the kids handle ARMS of any kind whether loaded or not in the presence of some one who himself is mature enough to handle the ARMS.

This bullet will have 90 ft. lbs energy at 150mtr enough to take down rabit or duck.

(80014, ' [quote=SevenMagnum]yes bro non toxic, so have you heard that LEAD is toxic?[/quote]\n\nIf I,ve understood correctly, your query was whether the lead is toxic or not? Yes, It is very much toxic bro. Prolonged exposure to increased volume of lead causes toxicity.\n\n\n[u][b]WikiPedia Says[/b][/u]\nLead poisoning (also known as plumbism, colica pictonium, saturnism, Devon colic, or painter''s colic) is a medical condition caused by increased levels of the heavy metal lead in the body. Lead interferes with a variety of body processes and is toxic to many organs and tissues including the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and reproductive and nervous systems. It interferes with the development of the nervous system and is therefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent learning and behavior disorders. Symptoms include abdominal pain, headache, anemia, irritability, and in severe cases seizures, coma, and death.......\n\n[u][b]Lead Toxicity[/b][/u]\n\n[url]http://www.environmentaldiseases.com/article-lead-toxicity.html[/url]\n\nIn developed countries lead poisoning is not prevalent; however, in developing countries lead poisoning is extremely common, to such an extent that world-wide lead toxicity and lead poisoning remain the most common of occupational poisoning..............\n\n\n[u][b]Lead Toxicity[/b][/u]\n\n[url]http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/t/neurology/c/10189/[/url]\n\nWhile the overall incidence of lead poisoning has decreased, it is still prevalent. News of toy manufacturers using lead paint has drawn attention to a threat that never really went away. In the United States today, 1.6% of children have toxic blood levels, compared to 4.4% in the early 1990s.1 Approximately 10.1 in 100,000 of adults were estimated to be suffering from lead toxicity in 2002.2,3 Lead is the most common neurotoxin in the environment.4 Current standards define a lead blood level of 10 mcg/dL in the as being toxic in children.5 In adults, a level of 25 mcg/dL is considered toxic. 2,3 Any level of lead can have toxic manifestations, and all health care practitioners should become familiar with the signs, symptoms, and treatment of lead poisoning.............\n\n\nLet me also say that shooting at the sources of water being used for drinking purposes is also not allowed as it increases the lead level in water, especially in case of lakes.', ''),

(80038, ' Dr sahib one thing is for sure .17HMR is expensive (around Rs50) than other small bore competition ammo(.22LR) but you cannot hunt ducks upto 150M with .22LR. When we want to get something versatile we mostly compromise on one thing or the other. You know in small bore rifle competitions (prone and 3 position) participants can use calibers not bigger than .22. Range is also 50M. when we want a specialised competition rifle there are no issues of pricy ammo, as .22LR is available in a great variety, starting from plinking ammo(around Rs12) upto match grade(TenX Rs35). There are no issues either when someone wants a very accurate hunting rifle(within the limits of .22LR) that can also be used for target shooting.\nBut surely there are few issues when we want to stay in the limits of small bore competitions and at the same time want to hunt small game at medium ranges. Either we would have to get a little closer to the game for hunting or would have to pay some extra bucks for shooting. \nSir if you want to try .17HMR or .17Mach2 just give me a call whenever you travel to Lahore. My SAKO quad comes with all rimfire inter changeable barrels (.22LR, .22WMR, .17Mach2and .17HMR). I will be more than happy to cater for you.

If so, even than it is also very helpful for shooters like us as it reminds us that we have a lot to learn.\nAt our national level competitions the position holders shooting 9mms, score around 190/200 (95%) on standard pistol targets. Which means a group of around 2.5"or even tighter catering for an odd flyer or two.\nFlinching is sometimes not detectable through cameras as it is imperceptible and is the result of undesired muscle movement within the body.

You know in small bore rifle competitions (prone and 3 position) participants can use calibers not bigger than .22. Range is also 50M. when we want a specialised competition rifle there are no issues of pricy ammo, as .22LR is available in a great variety, starting from plinking ammo(around Rs12) upto match grade(TenX Rs35). There are no issues either when someone wants a very accurate hunting rifle(within the limits of .22LR) that can also be used for target shooting.\nBut surely there are few issues when we want to stay in the limits of small bore competitions and at the same time want to hunt small game at medium ranges.

(80163, ' [b]A Beginner''s Guide to Stopping Power[/b]\n\nBy Chuck Hawks\n\nMuch of what one reads about the subject of handgun stopping power is a mixture of truth, half-truth, untruth, rumor and legend. A good place for inquiring minds to start would be to read the books by Ed Sanow and Evan Marshall, which are the most important works on the subject at the present time. They did the research, visited the morgues, talked to the shooting victims and police, and in the end collected the validated data from actual shootings that demonstrates what has worked in the real world. Their findings can correct a lot of popular misconceptions for those who are willing to learn.\n\nWhen discussing terminal ballistics what seems "reasonable" on the face of it often turns out not to be, sometimes for fairly complex reasons. One example would be the alleged superiority of the semi-wadcutter (SWC or "Keith style") bullet form. General Julian Hatcher, who invented the widely quoted (and copied) theory of Relative Stopping Power, and those who followed his lead theorized that such a bullet should be 25% more effective than the traditional Round Nose (RN) bullet. And, in fact, the SWC style bullet does look somehow deadlier than a RN bullet. Its sharp shouldered, truncated cone configuration was alleged to "chop" a chunk out of tissue and blood vessels as it passed through, rather than press them aside as it was alleged a RN bullet would do. This seemed to make sense to me, and for years I shot SWC style bullets. But when Sanow and Marshall evaluated over 100 actual shootings with 158 grain .38 Special lead SWC bullets, there proved to be no significant difference in stopping power compared to 158 grain .38 Special lead RN bullets at the same velocity. Clearly, the Hatcher theory has some flaws, no matter how reasonable it may seem.\n\nThe stopping power of any handgun bullet turns out to be a function of its ability to disrupt vital bodily functions, not the diameter or weight or initial shape of the bullet that strikes the victim. For example, the difference in the size of the entrance hole made by a .451" bullet compared to that made by a .355" bullet in an elastic (semi-self sealing) material like skin turns out to be largely irrelevant to stopping power. The idea (which I have heard expressed) that a bigger bullet makes a bigger hole to "bleed out" a man or an animal is faintly ridiculous.\n\nThe principle method of both stopping and killing with any firearm, whether rifle or pistol or shotgun, is the disruption of vital bodily functions. Fatally damage any animal''s heart, liver, lungs, or central nervous system (including Homo sapiens) and it is not going to live long enough to bleed out. Fail to put your bullet in a vital spot and you are very likely to have a problem with a man or an animal. That is not to say that some bullet placements might not eventually cause death by loss of blood, or infection, or some other mechanism, but that is never the goal of any hunter OR gunfighter who wants an immediate one shot stop.\n\nReaders who have done some deer hunting have probably observed that often the entrance wound from a modern expanding rifle bullet (like a 100 grain .243, 130 grain .270, or 150 grain .308) seems minimal, with almost no external blood loss at all. In addition, there may be no exit wound--the bullet is often found just under the hide on the off side. But if the shot was true the deer''s lungs probably look like they went through a blender, and the animal was down in seconds. That is an illustration of nearly perfect stopping power and it has little or nothing to do with the relatively small caliber of the bullet involved.\n\nModern big bore advocates, following in the footsteps of Jeff Cooper (who I respect greatly and regard as a fine and very persuasive writer), will claim that the example cited in the paragraph above and witnessed by countless tens of thousands of deer hunters does not apply at typical handgun bullet impact velocities. They argue that below some magic impact velocity (usually about 2000 fps) the temporary stretch cavity that contributes so much to the lethality of rifle bullets like those in the example above ceases to exist. These writers continue to ignore any facts contrary to their preconceptions. (As an aside, it is interesting that big bore rifle fans use a similar argument, but for them the magic velocity is typically about 2400 fps.)\n\nUnfortunately, they are simply wrong about pistol and rifle terminal ballistics being fundamentally different, which can and has proven by controlled testing and high speed photography. In fact, they are fundamentally similar. Both depend on disrupting the function of vital organs, and bullets that reach such organs and expand quickly and violently, thus destroying a lot of tissue, are the best way to accomplish this, whether fired from a short barrel or a long one.\n\nHow could the terminal ballistics of pistols and rifles be so different, since today we have pistols chambered for rifle cartridges and rifles chambered for pistol cartridges? In general, rifles have an advantage in kinetic energy, and this gives them an advantage in the amount of potential damage they can cause. (Of course, most of the big bore boys don''t believe that kinetic energy matters, either, but that is their problem.)\n\nBut in terms of the mechanisms of wound dynamics, rifle bullets and pistol bullets are both bullets, and function in pretty much the same way. The stopping power of pistol loads and the killing power of rifle loads are both based on a combination of the temporary stretch cavity and the permanent crush cavity produced by the bullet as it traverses the target. Any theory that ignores either of these factors will give erroneous results. Ignore the temporary stretch cavity and your results will favor big caliber bullets. Ignore the crush cavity and your results will favor high velocity, nearly explosive bullets. Both results will be incorrect.\n\nFor at least 40 years I have been reading claims by various "authorities" that bullets cannot be made to expand reliably at typical handgun velocities. This is just plain not true. I discovered that in the middle 1960''s by shooting game with .357 Magnum JHP expanding bullets, and it certainly isn''t true now. These opinions usually trace their origin to ancient theories and flawed experiments, particularly the Thompson-LaGard study conducted around the turn of the (20th) Century and General Julian Hatcher''s aforementioned Theory of Relative Stopping Power.\n\nWhen applied to contemporary handgun cartridges, theories based on Hatcher (which include Cooper''s and Taylor''s "Short Forms") have a statistical correlation to reality of only .64. In other words, they are meaningless. A vocal minority of gun writers and their disciples (again mostly big bore pistol fans) have come to accept this bunk as gospel, but it is really in the same category as urban legends. These "authorities" have been repeating this misinformation for as long as I can remember--but that does not make them right.\n\nIt is instructive to read the actual results of the Thompson-LaGard cattle shooting experiments, which I have done. I urge my readers to do the same. It would be hard to imagine a less appropriate or more poorly controlled study. Despite the significance ascribed to it to this day by the ignorant and willfully blind, it proved absolutely nothing about the lethality or stopping power (on humans) of the handgun cartridges and loads tested. And it is even less relevant (if possible) to modern handgun ammunition, since no expanding bullets were tested.\n\nAll that the Thompson-LaGard experiment really proved is that none of the handgun loads tested were effective at killing cattle. Most of the bovines those early experimenters shot had to be put down with a sledge hammer! The conclusion that the .45 caliber pistol was superior was forgone from the outset due to the bias of the testers, and it became their official conclusion despite a startling lack of data to support it. Interestingly, the only steer put down quickly with one shot was killed by a round from the high velocity 7.65mm (.30 caliber) Luger pistol!\n\nWell designed bullets (which includes most of the JHP pistol bullets now on the market) expand very reliably at their intended impact velocity. How do you imagine the 115 grain JHP 9x19 +P load, 125 grain JHP .357 load, 155 grain JHP .40 S&W load, and 230 grain JHP .45 ACP loads earned those outstanding 90%+ one shot stop records in the real world? In a sentence: due to the consistent performance of their JHP bullets.\n\nThe famous 125 grain .357 JHP bullet, the most effective one shot stopper of all handgun loads, penetrates 13.25" in ordinance gelatin and produces a football shaped stretch cavity. This is how the very best bullets perform. And bullet performance has a great effect on stopping power.\n\nFor example, the .40 S&W has higher one shot stop percentages in the real world than the 10mm Auto. Yet both use exactly the same caliber bullets, and the 10mm Lite load has exactly the same velocity as the .40 S&W. What gives?\n\nThe difference is a function of the terminal performance of the bullets involved. The FBI adopted the 10mm Lite load and became the main driving force behind 10mm load development. The FBI protocol calls for more penetration, and therefore less expansion, than is desirable to maximize stopping power in most shooting situations. They are more concerned about shooting through car doors, barricades, and so forth than putting criminals down with one shot in the typical frontal shooting situation that homeowners and civilians are most likely to face. The FBI essentially wanted ammunition designed for extended gun battles with perps hiding behind cover, and that is what they got. But as a result most 10mm ammo has less actual stopping power than the lighter, faster expanding bullets used in the best .40 S&W loads.\n\nI wrote this article, not as a diatribe against big bore handguns (indeed, some of them--using JHP bullets--are near the top of the stopping power list), but because I have grown weary of hearing and reading the same old misinformation endlessly repeated. My opinion is no better than anyone else''s unless it correlates with reality. Read the actual studies, not what others say about the studies, and decide for yourself. For those concerned with the problem, handgun stopping power is too important a subject to be left to urban legend.', '');

While many of my comments will apply to the 1911, I will discuss that particular pistol in relation to more modern tackle later on in this article.\n\nI was first employed by Jeff Cooper’s own gunsmith, Mr. James Hoag, who is still in business in Southern California. While the computer revolution has certainly improved the consistency of manufacture of arms, 30 years ago in this shop we certainly had no shortage of reliable 1911 model pistols used by both police and combat shooting competitors, and I vividly remember both Mickey Fowler and Mike Dalton. These champions used Hoag-built pistols to become IPSC Master Class shooters in the Southwest Pistol League, which Cooper founded in the early 1970s.\n\nThese pistols were shot daily by these and others for several thousand lead-bulleted reloads per week, so we saw just how filthy a 1911 could become and still keep working. At the time, the only game in town was a modified Colt pre-or-Series 70 Government Model in .45ACP, well before all of the other manufacturers came along to make the 1911 the most copied semi-automatic pistol of all time. I have seen powder residue from over 1,500 rounds shot in three days, with nothing more than motor oil used to keep pistols lubricated, and this was by no means unusual or extraordinary use.\n\nMalfunctions then and today tend to be primarily magazine related. Older pistols like the 1911 have both a frame and barrel feed ramp and were designed around round nosed, full metal jacketed military ball ammunition, while just about all of the newer designs dispense with the frame feed ramp and have magazines designed to provide a proper “nose-up” attitude that directs the round directly into the chamber.\n\nOld style U.S. Government Issue magazines had straight, nearly full case length feed lips, while all newer designed guns and mags use shorter release length lips. Examples of 1911 magazines the author has used over the years include Chip McCormick Power Mags, Colt factory (made by Colt subcontractor Metalform) and Novak’s .45 Shop (made by subcontractor, the Italian company “ACT”).\n\nMagazines should be routinely, every 500 rounds or so, stripped and cleaned using standard solvents and then wiped dry. One can very lightly oil the spring to combat corrosion, but the interior of the mag should be left dry so as not to accumulate powder residue. During the cleaning, I always inspect the magazines for cracks on the feed lips on the corners of the rear spine of the magazine. This is generally where a magazine will fail, due to spring tension and usage, although leaving McCormick or genuine Colt magazines fully loaded for months, or even years, does not usually promote problems.\n\nThe most common magazine induced malfunction is the so-called “bolt over base” failure, where the slide overrides the loaded magazine and fails to strip the round from it. Usually this is remedied by installing a new factory magazine spring, or one from Wolff Gunsprings of Pennsylvania. These are available in standard, or +5% strengths, with the latter used to increase feed speed when heavier than standard recoil springs are used. Unless one is experiencing feed issues, I would tend not to replace magazine springs unless one is using a heavier-than-stock recoil spring.\n\nAnother type of malfunction is a partial feed, with the bullet either impacting the barrel’s feed ramp and stopping, or entering the chamber, but not fully seating. I would usually check the extractor tension to insure that it was not excessive, ensure that the chamber is adequately clean, or inspect the cartridges to see that they have been properly loaded and that overall length and diameter of the cartridge is within specification. If a round fails to fully chamber, this may indicate a weakened recoil spring and this is a normal wear item available at minimal cost that should be replaced every 1,500 to 3,000 rounds in a 1911 pistol.\n\nI have also seen feed problems that involve the loaded round impacted mid-case by the slide on the way to the chamber, requiring a “tap-rack-bang” drill to clear. These are usually also a sign of weak mag springs.\n\nJust about all pistols operate using a “controlled round feed,” meaning that the rim of the case is grabbed by the extractor on the feed stroke from the magazine and guided into the chamber by it. This is similar to the system used by manually cycled bolt-action rifles such as the Mauser ’98 and the Winchester Model 70.\n\nOn a Model 1911, the extractor is essentially a leaf spring and it must be fitted to provide the correct amount of tension on the cartridge. A simple test of this is to strip the slide of its barrel, take a loaded cartridge, and place its rim under the extractor. See if the tension is sufficient to hold it against the breechface.\n\nIn addition, it is best to ensure that the lower edges of the extractor are lightly radiused and have those edges broken by a Swiss file and polished. I would also advise that older 1911''s have their standing breech faces polished with 400-grit aluminum oxide, to smooth the surface and allow the case head to slide under the extractor hook with minimum friction.\n\nOn more modern designs, the extractor is usually a coil-spring powered hook, visible to the rear of the ejection port, pivoting around a cross pin drilled vertically through the slide (Beretta 92, HK USP, Smith & Wesson 1911s, Springfield XD) or retained by a plunger detent pin (Glock, HK-P7 Series, some recent Kimber 1911 models, SiG P-Series, Walther P-38 and PP/PPK Series). These are usually very reliable and require little maintenance, though I have personally had my Kimber TLE extractor eject itself on recoil. The company replaced the entire slide with a conventional 1911-style internal extractor under warranty.\n\nI would static test these extractors the same way. The ejector on most semi-automatic pistols is a pinned in place fixed hook attached usually to the left rear of the frame rail adjacent to the hammer. These generally have no functional issues, though the occasional one can be angle adjusted, again with a small Swiss file, to alter the ejection pattern to keep hot brass from hitting the shooter, or to shorten the distance the brass flies to aid in its recovery if one reloads.\n\nWhile this list of possible reliability issues seems long, especially to a revolver shooter, I feel the need to remind the readers that it also doesn’t take much to tie up a revolver; just a few grains of unburned powder under an extractor star is enough to keep the cylinder from closing after a reload, while an average good self-shucker can be relied upon under more extensive use. (I think I can recall having to blow powder from beneath the extractor star of a DA revolver once in about 45 years! -Ed.)\n\nMost of the modern (designed and manufactured after about 1980) semi-auto pistols of good manufacture tend to run pretty well, though all benefit from a regular cleaning and lubrication regimen, with few exceptions. Beretta 92 series pistols should have their locking blocks examined and/or replaced every 5,000 rounds or so, to ensure they do not crack from recoil forces, and owners of these pistols should always use factory magazines and adequate lubrication of the slide and frame rails Ditto the locking lug recesses on both sides of the interior of the slide.\n\nGlock and Heckler & Koch USP pistols generally don’t have reliability issues and generally do not require much lubrication to function. Glock pistols will occasionally break slide locks or their attached leaf springs, but these are drop-in replacement parts offered at minimal cost. While there are those who may insist that lubing is optional for these handguns, it is my view that heavy sliding moving parts should have some lubricant to reduce wear, so long as it is not “excessive” and traps powder residue against those surfaces. Glocks and HK USP''s have stamped frame rails that are both hardened and thin and act, presumably, as “crud cutters.” They offer minimal space for foreign object collection as the slide recoils and are among the very few pistols lacking conventional rails and thus do not need much lubricant to function. (Glock recommends a non-greasy lubricant such as Prolix, not gun oil. -Ed.)\n\nI also think that the SiG P-series pistols require minimal lubrication, though it is a good idea to keep after corrosion on earlier carbon steel slides, grip screws and magazine bodies with an invisible light film, but observable by feel, as necessary. Current models have slides manufactured of machined stainless steel, although I would still use a good quality light lubricant on the rails. In my opinion, the combination of steel slide and aluminum frame, typical of many modern pistols, should be lubed.\n\nThese, and the Smith & Wesson “Third Generation,” the Czech CZ-75 series and Springfield’s XD should all be lightly lubricated. Typically, in addition to the slide and frame rails, I would also place one drop of gun oil on the firing pin lock stud protruding from the underside of the slide adjacent to the disconnector track, two drops at the unlocking surface of the barrel and slide and two drops applied to the barrel tube as it slides within the slide.\n\nI have personally used standard old Hoppe’s No. 9 solvent, or some of the newer copper-cutting solvents for cleaning and some of the newer “cleaner, lubricant, protectant” (aka “CLP”) products such as “Break Free,” Tetra, or most recently, a full-synthetic product known as “EEZOX” that promises a wide operating temperature range of -40 to +150 degrees F. It is of very light viscosity when applied lightly to manufacturer’s directions and becomes a dry lube when the volatile carrier evaporates, thus making it good for dusty conditions. One has to discontinue use of more conventional lubricants, so as not to over lube with EEZOX, as the dried film is invisible. I have also used Tetra’s “Gun Grease” on the slide and frame rails, as these are heavy reciprocating/sliding surfaces and this light grease reduces the likelihood of having one’s lube stain clothing.\n\n.22 pistols suffer, generally speaking, more powder residue than centerfire pistols. In addition, their lubricated lead bullets leave more barrel residue, and it would be good in my opinion to clean them every 250-500 shots by routine stripping and lubrication. Pistols such as the Colt Woodsman, High-Standard or Ruger .22 automatics are very reliable and robustly constructed and seldom experience problems if they are kept reasonably clean.\n\nThe same cleaning regimen applies to centerfire pistols shooting mostly reloaded lead bullets. The powders used in reloading are often not as clean burning as factory loaded jacketed ammunition, which compounds the problem. Please note that neither Glock nor Heckler & Koch recommends the use of lead bullets in their polygon-rifled barrels, due to possible lead stripping causing a potential over-pressure situation.\n\nI would suggest examining a concealed carry pistol weekly by unloading it, field stripping it and brushing it free of any clothing lint from covering garments, especially if worn inside the waistband. Usually a good cleaning every 250-1,000 rounds is all that is necessary, although I would make sure that the bore was clean and lacked obstructions of any kind.\n\nFor daily carry use, I carefully inspect every round of ammo before I load it into my magazine for burrs, dents, or out of spec diameter. Sometimes I will go as far as stripping the barrel from the pistol and dropping each round into the chamber to ensure that it passively chambers from gravity alone to double check diameter. Look at the factory tapered crimp or case cannelure that helps to hold the bullet in place on the feed stroke, in order to insure that there is no bullet setback that can cause an over-pressure situation.\n\nBullet ogive (nose) shape should be rounded in profile for reliability. Some of the older jacketed hollow point designs, such as the Sierra jacketed hollow cavity loaded by Cor-Bon (among others), use a more sharp-edged truncated conical design which may exacerbate feeding problems. The general rule of thumb for maximum reliability is to use a bullet shape that is as close to “round nosed FMJ” as possible, particularly in 1911 pistols. Bullet shape seems to make little or no difference to Glock pistols.\n\nNote that while I am discussing the most prevalent, straight-walled cartridges, such as .25 ACP, .32 ACP, .380 ACP, 9X19mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, less common bottlenecked rounds such as the 5.7X28mm FN, 7.62X25mm Russian Tokarev, 7.63mm Mauser and .357 SiG offer theoretically near flawless feeding due to the bore diameter being much smaller than the case diameter. In essence, the rear of the chamber is a large funnel. This may be one of the reasons why the .357 SiG round has been adopted by elements of the U.S. Secret Service and Federal Air Marshals.\n\nI distinguish in my own mind between “service level clean” and “storage level clean.” The former merely needs to have the bore cleaned, the breech face of the slide tooth brushed free of powder residue under the extractor and lightly lubricated as required. Long-term storage is more a matter of protecting it against corrosion, although the lubricants mentioned above will do a good job of protecting one’s investment, as will storage in a cool, dry place.\n\nHaving said all this and despite all the things that can potentially go awry, the semi-automatic pistol is where most of the design ingenuity, manufacture and sales is happening in the handgun market today. With good care, a quality autoloader can be one’s trusted companion for decades of use.', ''),
(80165, ' [b]Handguns for Teaching a Beginner[/b]\n\nBy Chuck Hawks\n\nMost reasonably experienced handgunners have been faced with a request for informal shooting lessons. These usually come from a friend, spouse, relative, or youth interested in learning how to shoot, or at least in shooting a "real gun" to see what it''s like. Such requests should be taken seriously, as there is no better way to grow our sport. Over the years, I have found that most of these requests come from young people and women, with women constituting the majority.\n\nIn many cases the motive behind such a request involves the realization on the part of a woman that learning to shoot is a positive step towards real liberation, far more effective than joining the N.O.W. gang or demonstrating in the street. The ability to protect herself, and perhaps her children, without the necessity of relying on the police or anyone else (who probably won''t be available when needed, anyway) is a tremendous boost to anyone''s self-confidence. That, after all, is one of the primary reasons that Sam Colt invented his revolver.\n\nWhatever the reason someone decides to give shooting a try, the ball is in your court as soon as they ask you to help. You don''t have to be a professional instructor to get someone started right. If you understand the fundamentals of gun safety, gun handling, and handgun shooting (especially stance, grip, sight alingnment, and trigger control), can express them clearly, and possess the requisite patience and understanding to help a neophyte lean a new skill, you will do fine. (If you don''t feel up to the task, refer the person to someone who is.)\n\nObviously, you should not allow yourself to show anger under any circumstance, and don''t raise your voice. Teach by example (show and tell), interact with your pupil in a friendly manner, and use lots of positive reinforcement (praise, in other words) when they do something right. If you can convince your student to focus on the front sight (not the target!), and squeeze the trigger until the gun goes off (a surprise break), you will have them well on their way.\n\nOf course, to teach someone how to shoot you must own a handgun suitable for the purpose, which brings us to the point of this article. If you get enough requests for informal lessons, it may be worthwhile to purchase a gun specifically for use as a "trainer." The training handgun, of course, can be a perfectly useful field, plinking, and informal target pistol when it is not being used as a trainer.\n\nThe cartridge\n\nFor teaching beginners I strongly recommend a revolver chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. That is the right cartridge and the right kind of pistol for the job.\n\nThe .22 LR cartridge is by far the best choice for a new shooter. The report of a .22 is mild and the recoil negligible, crucial factors in a training pistol. It is accurate, widely available, and inexpensive. Remember that initially a beginner will be reluctant to spend a lot of money for ammunition, and while you can probably afford to supply them with .22 LR cartridges, it would quickly become an economic burden to supply them with centerfire cartridges.\n\nThe handgun\n\nRevolvers are simpler to operate and safer than autoloaders in the hands of a beginner. They are also very unlikely to "jam" or malfunction, which can be quite upsetting to a beginner.\n\nI feel that the best all-around training revolver is a Colt Diamondback DA revolver with a 4" barrel. The 4" Diamondback is moderate in weight (28.5 ounces), safe, has an excellent action, adjustable sights, and is very accurate. Sadly, it is no longer produced and is therefore available only on the used market. Continuing demand insures that a good Diamondback is expensive and sometimes hard to find.\n\nMy next choice would be a Ruger New Model Super Single Six Convertible. As a trainer, this single action revolver is most suitable with a 4 5/8" or 5 1/2" barrel. The Super Single Six is probably the safest (most foolproof) revolver on the market. They are reliable, come with adjustable sights and offer good accuracy. They are widely distributed, and you even get an extra .22 Magnum cylinder in the deal. Fortunately, New Model Super Single Sixes are moderate in price, new or used.\n\nThe 6" Diamondback and 6 1/2" Super Single Six barrel options are better for the experienced shooter as they have a longer sight radius and offer better ballistic performance. However, the 4" to 5.5" barrels make for a lighter and more compact gun, and that is important to most neophytes.\n\nIf you want a lightweight revolver specifically for very weak individuals, the Ruger New Model Bearcat might be a reasonable alternative. It comes with a 4" barrel and weights only 24 ounces, compared to 32 ounces for a Super Single Six with a 4 5/8" barrel. Unfortunately, however, the Bearcat lacks the adjustable sights that I regard as a practical necessity.\n\nI strongly prefer adjustable sights because adjustable sights make it easy to set up the revolver for the individual shooter and the ammunition in use. Experienced shooters know that it is the group size, not its location, that tells the tale; but beginners like to see groups in the center of the target.\n\nIn my experience, practically all beginners are at first startled by the weight of real guns, but they adapt quickly and within a couple of weeks are managing medium weight pistols quite well. This includes the women I have taught to shoot (informally, as I am not a professional instructor).\n\nI feel that learning to shoot is just that--it is not personal protection, combat, competition, plinking, or hunting. Those things come later. For teaching, what I recommend is a safe, accurate, durable, low recoil, medium weight revolver with adjustable sights and a decent trigger. The Super Single Six fills the bill in every respect. (The "lawyer approved" stock trigger can be lightened without resort to a gunsmith if you so desire.) Once they learn the fundamentals of trigger squeeze and sight alignment the novice can easily transition to whatever type of handgun they prefer for their intended purpose.\n\nOther potentially suitable training revolvers include the Ruger SP101 (DA, fixed sights, 4" barrel, 34 ounces), S&W Model 34 22/32 Kit Gun (DA, adj. sights, 4" barrel, 22.5 ounces), and Taurus Model 94 (DA, adj. sights, 4" or 5" barrel, 25 ounces). The Ruger is a nice revolver but lacks adjustable sights. Taurus, a Brazilian brand, has steadily improved in quality over the years, but remains a lower cost knock off of the basic Smith and Wesson revolver design. A copy is seldom as good as the original.\n\nThe S&W Kit Gun is probably the best of this group. It is particularly suitable for a person with small hands, as it is light, built on a small frame, and has a skimpy grip. A good used example built in the 1950''s or 1960''s is probably the best option if you can find one; later production declined in quality. Pachmayr grips are a worthwhile addition for most shooters.\n\nThere are, of course, many other .22 revolvers on the new and used markets. Some of these may make acceptable trainers, but most are too heavy, too expensive, or inferior in one way or another to the models already mentioned.\n\nOptical sights\n\nAnother useful accessory on a training revolver is a red dot optical sight. These are easy to mount on a Super Single six, as well as several other popular revolvers. Optical sights (scopes and red dot sights) put the point of aim and the target into a single sighting plane and allow the beginner to concentrate on a surprise break trigger squeeze, simplifying the crucial initial stage of learning how to shoot. Red dot sights, unlike a conventional telescopic sight, don''t magnify the target or the shooter''s tremors and wobbles. The latter is important, as it is very disconcerting to a beginner.\n\nMost people quickly learn to hit the target with a red dot sight, so they get positive reinforcement and a feeling of accomplishment early on, which tends to make them enjoy the learning process and makes it more likely that they will eventually become recreational shooters.\n\nOnce the new shooter masters trigger control, then you can revert to iron sights and introduce the problem of front and rear sight alignment on the target as the next step in their shooting education. They will learn faster because they already know how to squeeze the trigger and can devote most of their concentration to the front sight. The fewer new concepts they have to learn at any one time, the better.\n\nNecessary accessories\n\nAs a minimum you should be able to initially supply your pupil with hearing and eye protection. That usually means a pair of "earmuff" type ear protectors and a pair of inexpensive shooting glasses (if they don''t already wear glasses). If they become interested in shooting they will soon want to purchase their own "ears" and "eyes," but you need to have loaners to get them started.\n\nIf the initial shooting experience is to take place from a bench rest, you will need to provide a couple of sandbags or some other sort of rest for your pupil to use. Fortunately, pistol shooting at the introductory level is not accessory intensive.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nHelping a new shooter get started is one of the most important things you can do for your sport. If our fine American shooting and marksmanship traditions are to survive the relentless assault of the mass media and the "politically correct" crowd, they must be passed along on a one-on-one basis. Surely the liberal media will not help us promote the shooting sports.\n\nUltimately, I feel that it is women who are not willing to become victims that are most likely to be the saviors of our Second Amendment rights. But somehow these potential new shooters must find a way to get started. That leaves it up to those of us who are experienced shooters to make an extra effort to help potential newcomers get started in our sport.', ''),
(80167, ' [b]Buying a Used Handgun[/b]\n\nBy Chuck Hawks\n\nThis article is concerned with the purchase of used handguns by the recreational shooter. Handguns that will be used for their intended purpose, which is shooting, not with collectors'' guns or wall hangers.\n\nThe common reasons to purchase a used handgun are to save money or acquire a model no longer in production. For example, I own several used Colt Diamondback revolvers in .22 LR and .38 Special, all of which I purchased after the Diamondback was discontinued.\n\nGuns hold their value very well, so if you later decide to trade or sell a used gun you should be able to get pretty much what you paid for it. This is very important to those of us who have bought and sold a fair number of firearms for our personal use.\n\nBuy from someone that you trust\n\nIf you are not an experienced used gun buyer, perhaps the most important thing is to buy from someone you trust. A reputable gun shop is not looking to rip you off, they are looking for repeat customers, and they should have already inspected the gun for condition and safety before putting it on the rack. They should be willing and able to give you an honest appraisal of the gun. Most will allow you to return a used gun for a refund or exchange within a reasonable period of time (like a week, not a month!) if it doesn''t meet normal standards of accuracy and function. Obviously, a handgun being returned must come back in the same condition it left the store.\n\nAlways test any pistol for function and accuracy with factory loads. If there is a problem, you want to be sure that reloaded ammunition cannot be blamed.\n\nI recently purchased a used Weatherby rifle from a local gun shop where I have done business for years. The owner was familiar with the history of this particular rifle, and assured me that he had seen the previous owner shoot consistent 3-shot groups of less than one inch at 100 yards. It checked out functionally perfect. We looked-up the rifle in the current issue of Fjestad''s Blue Book of Gun Values (always do this) and agreed on a price we could both live with. Had there been a problem of some sort (there wasn''t, the gun was exactly as advertised), I could have returned it without any hassle. This is the way a used gun sale is supposed to work, and it is entirely dependent on dealing with honest people.\n\nBuying through the mail or Internet\n\nMy advice to the novice used gun buyer is to avoid doing so. Don''t buy any firearm you cannot inspect first. Not that there is a problem with most mail order sales, but should there be a problem you are entirely dependent of the good offices of a stranger. It is always better to deal face to face with the seller.\n\nHow to check the condition of a used handgun--general points\n\nBefore handling any firearm, always open the action and verify that both the chamber and the magazine are empty. Remove the magazine if possible. Every time a firearm changes hands it should be cleared.\n\n1. Look at the overall condition of the gun. Notice the condition of the bluing and the overall wear. Look for rust pitting on external metal surfaces. Are the grips in good condition? All screws should be tight and the screw heads un-marred. The gun doesn''t have to be perfect in every area, but it should show care rather than neglect. A pistol could be rough on the outside, yet perfect on the inside, but the chances are that an owner who didn''t care for the external parts of a gun also didn''t care for the parts you can''t see.\n\n2. The size, shape and angle of the grip should fit your hand. When you bring the gun to eye level your master eye should be looking straight down on the barrel. The gun should not be tipped up or down. Having a gun that points naturally is especially important for a pistol that might be used for protection.\n\n3. Look carefully down the external length of the barrel to see that it looks straight and there are no subtle bulges. Don''t buy any handgun if you suspect that the barrel (or the cylinder of a revolver) has been bulged, no matter how slightly, or if it is not straight. Also look at the crown of the muzzle--it should not be dinged.\n\n4. Note the position of the rear sight on guns with adjustable sights. If it is way off to one side, suspect some sort of problem and ask to shoot the gun to verify accuracy before purchase. If the seller refuses, pass on the gun.\n\n5. Check the condition of the grips. There should not be any splits, chips, or cracks in the grips, particularly if you are looking at a discontinued model (for which it may be hard to find replacement grips). Scratches in the grip finish, worn checkering, and tiny nicks in the grips will not affect the gun''s function, but should lower the price.\n\nAs the screws holding wood grips to the grip frame are tightened they will tend to pull deeper and deeper into the wood. Check to see that they are not about to pull clear through. This is particularly common with Ruger single action (SA) revolvers, but applies to most guns with wooden grip panels.\n\n6. Get permission to dry fire the gun and check the trigger pull. Dry firing will not hurt most centerfire handguns, but it is still a good idea to use snap caps to protect the firing pin.\n\nWhatever the trigger pull weight, it should be consistent from shot to shot. If it feels like a stock factory trigger (too heavy with some creep), fine, you can get it adjusted later. If it feels crisp and breaks at 2.5-3 pounds it has probably been worked on or adjusted. This is great if done properly, as it will save you some money, but make sure that the piece will not jar off.\n\nTo test this, get permission to bump the butt of the cocked handgun against some firm but padded surface. The gun should not fire. Push against the fully cocked hammer (if the pistol has one) with your thumb--it should not slip out of its notch; reject the gun if it does.\n\n7. Check the inside of the barrel (and the chambers of a revolver''s cylinder). If the barrel is dirty, ask that it be cleaned or for permission to clean it yourself. Do not oil the barrel after cleaning, and be suspicious of any barrel that has been oiled. The shine from the oil can hide minor barrel imperfections and pitting.\n\nOnce the barrel is reasonably clean, dry, and oil free, open the action or remove the barrel and look into it from both ends. Use a bore light. Hopefully it will be clean and bright with sharp rifling. A slight amount of rust or pitting inside the barrel (or the cylinder of a revolver) will ordinarily not seriously degrade the performance of a handgun, unless it is a target pistol, but it should lower the used price.\n\nSpecific things to check on used revolvers\n\n1. Note the condition of the forcing cone at the back of the barrel. Slight erosion in this area, particularly on magnum revolvers, is not cause for concern, but it should not be seriously eroded. The more erosion you see the more the gun has been fired with heavy loads.\n\n2. Check for cutting of the top strap at the cylinder gap, particularly with magnum revolvers. A little erosion here will not hurt, but excessive cutting is undesirable and indicates a lot of shooting with heavy loads, or a wide cylinder gap, or both.\n\n3. To test the safety notch of a traditional single action revolver, pull firmly (about 8-10 pounds--this is not intended to be a test to destruction) on the trigger with the hammer in the safety notch to see if it can be easily forced. Put the revolver on half cock (the loading position) and repeat the test, applying about 5 pounds of pressure on the trigger. The hammer should not drop. This test does not apply to New Model (two screw) Ruger SA revolvers, as they use a different lockwork than traditional SA revolvers.\n\n4. The cylinder of Colt double action revolvers should be completely tight when the trigger is pulled all the way back (the hand forces the cylinder against the bolt). S&W revolvers are never as tight as a Colt, but at least they should not rattle. Slight cylinder play is permissible with S&W DA (and also Ruger SA) revolvers.\n\n5. Check the cylinder gap. It should not exceed .010", and .006" is ideal. Cock the gun to turn the cylinder so that every chamber, in turn, lines up with the barrel. The cylinder gap should remain constant.\n\nAlso, the cylinder should not slide back and forth appreciably on the cylinder pin. This is called endplay, and it generally increases with use.\n\n6. The crane of a swing out cylinder DA revolver should fit tight to the frame (when closed) without any unsightly gaps. If it doesn''t the crane may be sprung. When you wiggle the cylinder with your fingers the crane should barely move, if at all.\n\nWhile you are at it, check to make sure that the ejector rod has not been bent. This is easy to see if you spin the cylinder, which should spin true.\n\n7. Use you fingers or thumb to put a small amount of drag on the cylinder while you manually cock the revolver (single action mode). The cylinder bolt should click into the locking notches in the cylinder, locking the cylinder in place, at the end of each segment of cylinder rotation. If it does not, the gun is out of time and needs work. Then rapidly thumb cock the gun (don''t "fan" a revolver)--the cylinder should not rotate past the proper locking notch. Also, the bolt should not be dragging on the cylinder as it turns. If it does it will leave a clearly visible wear line in the cylinder''s finish.\n\n8. Examine the sideplate of a DA revolver. If it has been improperly disassembled it may show pry marks at the edge or have been warped. The sideplate should fit flush and tight, without any gaps.\n\n9. Check the tip of the firing pin, it should be smooth and rounded, not sharp or broken. The firing pin hole should not be chipped or burred.\n\nSpecific things to check on used semi-automatic pistols\n\n1. See that all of the controls work smoothly and with a reasonable amount of pressure. The safety should prevent the gun from firing (check by setting the safety and pulling the trigger normally). The slide lock should hold the slide open. The magazine release should release the magazine easily and yet hold it securely in place until it is pushed. If there is a grip safety the gun should not fire unless the grip safety fully depressed. If there is a magazine safety the gun should not fire unless the magazine is in place. Also, pulling the trigger should not fire the gun when the slide is held slightly out of battery.\n\n2. Cycle an autoloader to verify that it operates smoothly and properly. See that the slide is tight and reasonably free of slop when closed and the pistol is cocked. (There is ordinarily some play or the gun will not function.) Verify that the pistol fieldstrips and reassembles correctly. Also see that the action has been kept reasonably clean for proper functioning.\n\n3. Examine the slide (especially at the front and at the ejection port) and frame for excessive wear or cracks. Aluminum alloy frames are particularly susceptible to developing hairline cracks (and eventually failing) from extended use.\n\n4. The cocked hammer or striker of a SA auto pistol should not drop when the slide is closed smartly. If you can make the hammer drop by letting the slide slam closed the gun is unsafe.\n\n5. Check the magazine(s) for wear and condition. A proper magazine is very important to the functioning of an autoloading pistol. You want the original, name brand, magazine(s) in good condition. Inspect the feed lips for bends, cracks and wear, and insure that the seam at the back of the magazine is tight.\n\nAlso check the bottom of the magazine to insure that it has not been ejected from the pistol and allowed to fall to the ground. This looks great on TV or at action matches, but in real life it is very hard on magazines. Magazines are not expendable.\n\nConclusion\n\nQuality firearms are built to last for generations. This makes used guns a much better investment over time than most consumer goods. Buying a used handgun can be, and usually is, a rewarding experience. I have bought the great majority of all of the guns I have ever owned used, and I can''t remember ever being burned.\n\nWhat I do remember is a lot of fun owning and shooting guns I could not otherwise afford. Sometimes I have even made a slight profit when it became necessary to sell a gun that I originally purchased used. (Usually because I needed the money to purchase some other used gun I could not resist.) Buy used, save money, and have more fun shooting!', ''),

(80219, ' @Dr Sajid, choke tubes or fixed chokes determine the range at which pattern of the shotgun will fully develop(70% pallets in 30" circle). So they determine the optimum hunting or shooting distance with a certain choke.\nTechnically speaking chokes provide constriction like hose provides at the end of a pipe making the water to spray upto greater distances. Following chokes are widely used although there are other chokes like Skeet, extra Full and Turkey etc.\n\nCylende          70% pallets in 30" circle            20yds         No constriction\n\nIC (1/4)                    -                                       25yds        .010"\n\nM (1/2)                     -                                     30yds        .020"\n\nIM(3/4)                     -                                     35yds        .030"\n\nF                              -                                     40yds         .040"\n\nNow the question which choke is best for what type of game can be partially answered. Chokes just determine the distance at which you can take a shot with fully developed pattern. Mostly people hunt ducks, rabits with F and IM(3/4). At the same time Quail with Cylender and IC(1/4). I prefer patrige with M(1/2) and IM(3/4). This just depends on the way you hunt.\nQuestion of type of game is more adressed with the selection of the suitable ammo.\n\nNow the quesion of finding a choke for any type of hunt can be worked out personally by keeping in mind the size of the game, type of the ammo and the posibility of taking a shot at a certain distance. Like cylender choke will be too wide for  40yds while F will be too tight for 20yds.', ''),

(80260, ' My opinion: from the price point of view, the Taurus wins hands down. Just so you know, the Taurus PT92/99 is NOT inferior to the Beretta. The original Taurus PT92 was exactly similar to the ORIGINAL Beretta 92, built on the same machinery as the Beretta.\n\nThen comes the issue of the safety position, which I believe is more of a personal preference. I have little experience with guns, but I once held the Stoeger Cougar (which has a similar safety arrangement as the 92F), and found the safety a little awkward to engage. On the other hand, the safety of the PT917 (a derivative of the PT92) engages naturally for me.\n\nThe Beretta may have better collector value due to its greater renown and military usage.\n\nBtw, there are number of Beretta clones out there, none of them as famous as the Taurus. I agree that the PT92/99 is famous due to the parent 92F, but, that is not to say that it hasn''t made a name for itself.', ''),

If taken care of properly they will last as long as any Beretta. \n\nMore over living in Pakistan there is nothing to think about while making this choice. People in the U.S often pick the Taurus because it''s $100 USD cheaper than the Beretta ! That''s Rs. 8500. If the difference was the same or even 20 K then Beretta would be a consideration but at three times the price, Never. I have fired over 4000 rounds from my 99 and it is in ''Pristine'' condition. What more can a normal gun user ask from a weapon.\n\nBeretta shotguns however are a class of their own and very worth the 200 k + they command.', ''),

(80268, ' [quote=Malik1]A huge quality difference. One is a copy cat and other is original. And brother Syrianar a copy remains a copy and the copy itself speaks volumes of the original weapon. Had the original thing not been that good, the copy wouldn''t have been there. And if the copy does not perform like the original thing then it is not a copy. To be frank, Taurus makes poor man Beretta. PT92 is known to the world because of 92FS and not other way round. Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo in Belgium, by Duke of Wellington, bringing an end to the Napoleonic era of European history. However, Duke of Wellington, though performed better on that day, is still remembered because of Napoleon.[/quote]\nDear Malik Sb with all due respect I would like to differ, there is no difference of quality between 92 fs and pt 92/99 as pt 99/92 are produced on the same Beretta plant where they used to make 92fs, if anything Taurus have made a few design improvement over the time and as far as the prices are concerned Taurus is only cheaper because they can be legally imported into Pakistan but that is not the case with Beretta as there is a ban on European (and American) arms imports that is why Beretta is so expensive in our country and the dealer community is ripping the public off, if you remember the prices of Taurus were astronomical when the imports started but came down with passage of time. PT 92/99 is very good and reliable weapon being used as the standard side arm of many armies. And as far the issue of copy cat is concerned nearly all modern hand guns are the copies of Browning in some way or the other', ''),

Please tell me, if there is anybody out there on forum who would have still gone for Taurus if it was Rs 8500 cheaper than Beretta, and if he had to choose one.

This is neither something new nor something strange as gun forums all over the net are littered with such threads. \nHere at our forum there is something peculiarly different as there are too few members trying to rescue the Beretta. May be in this part of the world people take very rational decisions and don''t get swayed by the big names, they concentrate on the realthing while down playing the packaging. Is this the reality???????? Are people preferring Taurus PT92/99 over Beretta 92FS as they are same in performance or the former is being made under license, on the same machines acquired from the latter????\nI beg your pardon sir, this is not the case. In my humble opinion, people buy Taurus for its price and still want to take the pride of owning a Beretta. No one has the right(including me) to take their pride back, but, one can request one''s friends to give some repect to the real thing as wel. We can compare a mule with a horse if we wish, as, both are beautiful, similar looking(to some extent), some times share same blood line :D , mule is much cost effective and hard working, horse needs so much care. so on and so forth.\n\nI think Taurus is not a bad gun, rather a much better gun in its price.

(80430, ' AOA, \n\nLast week I arranged visits to two -Classified- ranges. On my first trip, I was alone and took my CF98 and about a 100 rounds with me. On the second trip, SlayerJatt, Starfish and YardieJatt were my guests. \n\nLet''s start from the first visit to the range. \n\nWeapon: [b]CF-98[/b]\nRounds fired:[b] 100[/b]\nTarget from firing position: [b]30 meters[/b]\nAmmo used: [b]50 Chinese BlueBox - 50 Chinese RedBox[/b]\nShooter: [b]Anthrax[/b]\n\nFTF''s and FTE''s: [b]NONE!![/b]\n\nThere were two targets on the range. I started off by firing the Chinese Red Box bullets. Magazine capacity was 15. \n\nHere''s the image of the first 15 rounds that I fired from my [b]CF98.[/b]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx11cFRJ][img]http://s1.postimage.org/11cFRJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n100 percent hit ratio. All the 15 rounds found their way to the target. From 30 meters, the result was beyond my imagination. \n\nAfter that, this target was reserved for a fellow shooter who was equipped with an MP5 so we''ll move on to the next target where I fired about 80+ rounds. \n\nHere''s what happened to that target; \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqFMkzJ][img]http://s3.postimage.org/FMkzJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nNote: The white paper in the middle wasn''t added until the very last few rounds. Before that, the target was open and I was firing all over the place. Usually, i started off by firing from the lower region and gradually bullet by bullet, I moved upwards towards the torso and at the very end I tried to aim the head of the target. The white spots are the visible last magazine that I fired. \n\nThe black circles represent the shots that were repaired. I wasn''t able to get the pictures after every 15 shots because of lack of time, but all the black spots are confirmed shots because where I was shooting, they repair the target with a patch as soon as a shooter finishes firing 15 rounds. \n\n[b]100 rounds Review:[/b]\n\nFrankly speaking, I''m in love with this weapon. It''s highly reliable and way accurate. For its first 100 rounds, it truly impressed me with its performance. Out of a 100 rounds, 97 managed to hit the target at 30 meters. Either I''m a very good shooter or this weapon is DEAD accurate. The later part is the reason IMO. The best part is that [b]there wasn''t a SINGLE FTF or FTE during the entire firing session[/b]. I would advice every CF98 owner to use Chinese Blue and Red box ammo for their weapon because of their great quality and reliability with the CF. \n\n[b]RANGE SESSION PART 2 with Anthrax, Slayerjatt, YardieJatt and Starfish.[/b]\n\nWeapons: [b]CF-98, Taurus PT-909, CZ-100 (Clone) and Remington 870 Magnum Wingmaster 29"[/b]\nRounds fired: [b]Not sure[/b]\nTargets from firing Position: [b]25 meters[/b]\nAmmo used: [b]Russian Ulyanovsk 9mm Luger - Chinese Blue and Red Box - Assorted shotgun shells (Shaheen and Imported)[/b]\nShooters: [b]Anthrax, SlayerJatt, Starfish, YardieJatt. \n[/b]\n\n[b]PART-I: Anthrax and CF-98[/b]\n\nThis time around, I decided to try the newly purchased Russian Ulyanovsk 9MM rounds. In all, I fired about 35 of these rounds and I was utterly disgusted by their poor performance and low quality. They had excessive flash, and the gunpowder kept coming back right at my face and I could literally feel it after firing a few bullets. Horrible sound and the worst part is that after only 35 rounds, the barrel of my gun was very hot. Comparing these with the 100 Chinese that I fired, the barrel didn''t get that hot. \n\nAfter firing the first 20 rounds, there was one FTF (Fire) and I stopped firing. 18 managed to hit the target; \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVsVtsi][img]http://s4.postimage.org/sVtsi.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI have a habit of aiming for the head and as you can see, I managed to put two rounds through the head after aiming at it and firing 5 shots. The rest of the result wasn''t as impressive as I hoped but it was o.k.\n\nDon''t have the results for the rest of the Russian rounds. \n[b]\nREVIEW FOR THE Russian Ulyanovsk Rounds: [/b] Utter Garbage! Do NOT purchase these rounds. Quite dangerous in my opinion. \n\n[b]CF-98 RAPID FIRE TEST:[/b]\n\nLoaded 15 Chinese Blue Box rounds and decided to test the guns limit. Rapid fire results came back quite positive as I wasn''t expecting to hit anything but dirt. 12 out of 15 rounds managed to hit the target. The results: \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx11in2i][img]http://s1.postimage.org/11in2i.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nEven with the rapid fire, this man is SERIOUSLY damaged :P \n\n[b]TAURUS PT-909 SESSION WITH SLAYERJATT AND STARFISH:[/b]\n\nSlayer had some troubles starting up because out of his first 10 shots, none hit the target. After that he loaded 5 Armscor hollow points and managed to hit the target 3 times with decent accuracy. \n\nAfter that, there was a mix firing session of the 909. Slayerjatt and Starfish fired about 22 rounds and the results came out shinning! \n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqFQLWJ][img]http://s3.postimage.org/FQLWJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nout of 22 Blue box Chinese rounds, 18 managed to hit the target. Since it was a collective firing session, we don''t know who''s responsible for the accurate shooting but I think both of them are amazing shooters and managed to obliterate the target and didn''t left much of his vitals. :D\n\n[b]TARGET ANNIHILATION SESSION with Starfish''s REMINGTON! [/b]\n\nIt was getting quite dark and we thought that its time we showed these targets who''s the boss. The boss of the night was Starfish''s Remington 12 Gauge. All of us fired the remmy and managed to hit a lot of other things along with the target. :P I''ll let the pictures do the talking now :D \n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts1lOoaA][img]http://s2.postimage.org/1lOoaA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=PqFRjRJ][img]http://s3.postimage.org/FRjRJ.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAs you all can see, the poor buggers tell a different story. We seriously had a LOT of fun that day and the Remmy left some pretty VISIBLE scars on these two targets. May they rest in peace, Ameen! :rolleyes:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter that firing session, we all headed towards [b]Starfish''s[/b] house to drop him off. We decided to eat something and we all had a great dinner from BBQ Tonite. \n\n[b]Slayer[/b] was concerned about cleaning his weapon (Finally :P) So we all went to [b]Starfish''s[/b] house where he took apart the 909 and cleaned it till it was squeeky clean.

(80442, ' @SPAYPANTHER...........Thanks for the credits bro, though I cannot fathom how you would change the "grip". Actually it''s the "length" of the grip that''s beneficial for smaller or medium hands, nothing to do with anything "rubbery" or "finger grooves" as part of extra "Hogue grip" or such add on stuff.\n\n I''d ask you to try feel the "slippiness" of the Chinese version in [i]sweaty palms[/i] during hot and humid summer nights. The gun will be kind of slipping out of your hands after a few rounds.\nThe Zastava kind of gets "arrested" within the palm.\n\nAnyhow, it''s my opinion, Chinese may have suited you better, and as it is with this or any other gun, when two of a kind are presented before you,[b] always take the one that gives YOU the right "feel".[/b]\n\nAs regards "concealability" I think there is minimal difference, only being that you got some two extra shots!', ''),

Yes, the problem is that CF is built to perform and its price tag usually confuses the buyer about its reliability and performance. After all, a couple of dealers I talked to once told me that this same pistol was selling for above 50 when it was introduced in Pakistan. But because of its massive import its price has gone down but the pistol itself can match any other pistol in the 50-60 price tag or even above. ;)\n\nP.S CF98''s design and functionality is primarily built upto Military standards. Exactly why its other variant is being used by the Chinese, South-Korean and Bangladeshi Army. There''s no question about its reliability and accuracy otherwise these three professional army''s wouldn''t have adopted it as their official sidearm.', ''),

(80555, ' I''m with Malik and HasanJamshed on this one. \n\nComparing Beretta with Taurus is not a fair comparison. The 92FS design and variants have seen REAL combat in wars all over the world. Specially during its tenure with the American forces, it saw a lot of action and never failed to achieve its objective. That is, to provide a user friendly and unbeaten design with a deadly punch. Then comes its experience with the Law enforcement agencies worldwide specially with the US LEA''s, one of the most professional in the world with more experience and real time combat than any other force. Currently being used by THREE "Professional" armies of the world. US/French/Italian armies still rely on the 92FS. Just because of its experience I''d say that nothing comes close to the 92FS. Compare Taurus with Beretta''s experience, what have they achieved so far with their clone in the professional world? Not talking about Townhouses and Suburbs. \n\nMalik1 hit the nail on the head when he said that no matter how much people admire the Taurus clone of Beretta, in practicality, if the real 92FS was available with a price difference of only 8500rs, no one would buy the Taurus clones of Beretta. \n\nNot that Taurus isn''t making an outstanding clone of the 92FS, they''re doing a great job and from what I''ve heard, they''re as reliable as the 92FS itself. But then again, If you were offered a Brazillian clone of Ferrari at the price difference of only 1 Lac Rs compared with the original, would you buy the clone or the real deal? Clone? I don''t think so! ;)', ''),

If compared regardless of price, Beretta 92fs is certainly a better gun than Taurus PT92. Beretta comes with a reliability and reputation whereas Taurus has always been facing reliability / quality control issues, in one form or the other (however, 92 / 99 remains one of their more reliable guns). \n\n2.  Therefore, if their is no price difference, or the difference is around say 10,000 only, I would definitely and always go for Beretta 92fs. (This however may never happen in reality in Pakistan, at least in the foreseeable future) :(\n\n3.  However, if I am given 2 OPTIONS that either:\n     -  Buy a Beretta 92fs (a reliable and time tested gun) \n\n                                                                       [b]OR[/b] \n\n     -  Get a Taurus PT92 / 99 (not a bad gun at all) along with two more guns (say CZ999 + Baikal 446 Viking + 1000 Chinese Norinco bullets + holster etc \n                                                                                                                                                                                                 [b] IN THE SAME PRICE [/b], then without giving it a second thought, I would go for the second option :)', ''),

(80890, ' @psychiatrist-1 Sir............. very considerate and interesting views there, Sir. I appreciate it. You''re right regarding the prices, this pertains to every kind of ammo, take a look at the 9mm ammo even, with Winchester white box coming down to around 10-15$ for a pack of 50. [b]Over here we pay that much amount for 10-12 rounds of the same thing, leave the remaining 40 in the box or so![/b]\n\nActually, once you get back over here, and we''re quite many who would like to assist you, for sure, it''s just the heck of bureaucratic involvement that discourages most people from going beyond the step of the very initiative by itself.\n\nEverything is so complicated over here, especially when it comes to firearms related items, that getting all those formalities of grant of permits etc, by itself is a very exhaustive process, only a highly dedicated, serious and well-connected member with a green channel all the way up, may ever be able to come out successful of. The costs I''m sure many of us would find bearable, however.\n\nFinally, I''m surprised to some extent how those companies you mention are really willing to engage into serious export opportunities for Pakistan, when I recently was turned down myself by Cabela''s on my desire to have an[i] innocent[/i] buttstock for my rifle sent over, reason being that "certain restrictions" apply for firearms related items to be shipped to Pakistan, though it''s a harmless accessory that cannot by any fathomable way "fire by itself"! Really discouraging. Don''t those restrictions apply for shipment of the "real and explosive" stuff? \n\nOverall, those dealers are right, our own authorities in imposing a hefty 200% taxation make these items less sought after. If this is done to promote our local industry sales, well, what can I say, they still cannot meet the demand, anyway!\n\ndawoodsb is into the business by himself, and may be able to shed some light upon the legal restrictions implied in the whole process of getting the import permits for such an endeavor from your side which no doubt would be welcomed gladly by all of us.

For most people 9mm would be a better choice as it''s available everywhere is cheaper than everything else except .22 and the lesser recoil works well for most people for a follow up shot. Someone has a signature saying a hit with a .22 is better than a miss with a .45. Couldn''t agree more.[/quote]\n\nCould not agree more with Abbas Sb. \n\nIMHO, swift reaction and flawless execution is the key to SD. One must be able to draw his weapon quickly and fire it accurately ten out of ten times. In the end therefore, it all boils down to one''s proficiency and confidence in firing with a particular weapon which comes with practice and for that one needs ammo and lots of it. I would for sure feel more confident with a 9mm or a TT with which I have fired a few hundred rounds as compared to a .357 Mag or .45 ACP with which, I have not been practicing enough.', ''),

(81039, ' Salam All,\nToday as always, the day was winding down and I was bored sooo, I decided to experiment with my Glock 34.  I wanted to install a round magazine catch button on the Glock.  I have had these magazine catch buttons for quite a while but never got around to doing this experiment.  The Magazine Catch Button is the rounded shape as offered by AroTek, Lone Wolf, and more recently Glock (only available in EU).  Sooo needless to say I stripped the pistol frame, removed the OEM Mag Catch Button and went to work.  I purchased a jig to install this type of mag catch and should anything have gone wrong then my Glock frame/receiver would have been ruined.  Furthermore this procedure is NOT reversible, once the cut has been made - only the round button can be used.  The Round Mag Catch is better than others offered in the market because its all one piece unit unlike most which require two screws to be installed with the part (I used one by Glockmeister and it broke), this Mag Catch not only increases the ergonomics (ease of reach), it also enhances the unique look of the pistol.\n\nFollowing are the pictures:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx18vJZJ][img]http://s1.postimage.org/18vJZJ.jpg[/img][/url]\nSee the Mag Catch button on top is OEM Glock and the one below it is the new rounded one by Lone Wolf (Same as Glock).\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx18vOZ0][img]http://s1.postimage.org/18vOZ0.jpg[/img][/url]\nHere I have the gun stripped next to the Jig which will cut the round shape in the Frame.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gx18vRt9][img]http://s1.postimage.org/18vRt9.jpg[/img][/url]\nIn this photo one can see the gun fitted inside the Jig....

However, Skeeter60 sahib has mentioned firing of 2Z ammo for over a decade from Glocks, Sigs and CZ 75B without any problem. As already mentioned, a friend of mine has fired more than 6000 2Z rounds with his CF98 and his pistol is still quite accurate with no visible wear and tear to the barrel or drop in muzzle velocity. Another friend of mine has fired more than 2000 2Z rounds from his Llama  M82 with no problems at all. On the other hand, some of my friends had problems in firing 2Z from Taurus 24/7 and we discontinued firing 2Z with Taurus immediately.

(81392, ' Thank you Tareen sb. for the valuable information about licensing breeder / propagation farms. \n\nAs for my (and starfish''s) efforts, we''ve been doing a lot of research on pheasant (particularly ring-necks, since they are the hardiest bird to raise) for over a year now and even managed to do a pilot with pheasant chicks this summer (observing their behavior when released in different areas and ascertaining their suitability for the region). Our sole purpose was making the conditions as optimal as possible and then allowing the birds to sustain themselves in the wild and breed successfully. The area is a partridge rich area, but there and there have never been any resident wild pheasants. Results for this year have been satisfactory (a LOT learned and a little achieved). Would definitely have achieved a lot more if we could get time off from our jobs (i''m in Karachi and starfish is in Lahore - and our little ''preserve'' is 4-5 hours from Lahore).\n\nAnyhow, Agha sb, i''m delighted that there are others like us and would be glad to help you with any habitat, pens etc, needs that you may have. I''m packing to move abroad in the next two days so i''ll be a little quiet for a bit. But i can be reached via email (or starfish :) ) at any time. I can even find resources in terms of journal articles, websites or books to help you with groundwork, since we have a lot of that. If you need a hand with habitat management and predator control tips once you''ve managed to acquire the land, please let us know as we think we can really help you there.\n\nThis post is getting long. One last point. When you say commercial farm, are you looking for a:\n\n1. commercial venture where you release birds for hunts\n2. just a pheasant farm where you raise pheasants for sale\n3. are you interested in introducing a wild pheasant population in the area (this is the path me and starfish have taken as our primary objective in the short and medium term)\n4. are you looking at supplementing an existing wild pheasant population\n\nWhen you select your area, it would also be useful to know if there are any resident pheasants there (this would save you a lot of habitat management and groundwork since you know it is sustainable for pheasants as it is) - i know the govt has a release site between Kalar Kahar and Choa Sedan Shah (or about) that they release pheasants (and even allow people to hunt them on a permit arrangement). The sites would be useful to visit for habitat ideas if you plan to launch a release and hunt venture.\n\nYou''re very right about Potohar. The area is definitely conducive to introducing a resident pheasant population (though somewhat inaccessible, our sites are in the same area as well). Will keep you posted on our efforts too as we plan to go into the second year of our pilot early in the summer of 2010, and keep us posted on yours. \n\nLooking forward to a birdy 2010.', ''),

I dont know if it is even possible here in Pakistan. Any help/guidance would be welcome. I think somewhere in Pothohar region would be ideal[/quote]\nDear Azam Sb, it is possible in pakistan, and being done in parts in many locations. There are some licensed pheasant, quail and partridge farms in Bahawalpur. \n\nAs Abbas Hayat has explained it, if you are looking for a pheasant farm (to produce pheasants for sale / shoot) then you should not worry about the area / habitat very much. For such a setup, any area would do since the farm is monitored / fenced / fed so the essential requirements of a suitable habitat (cover, food, water, nesting grounds) are already taken care of. Your average produce is 20 birds per pair in a season. \nYou will need to setup multiple pens. The type of pens will depend upon the output you want etc etc. You will hardly need an acre of land for the farm. Do let me know if you are interested, I might be able to set up a visit to a farm (i cant promise, but i ll sure talk to the owners for a visit) where you can see the pens and have some chit chat sessions with the bird keepers etc.\n\nIf you plan to make a "preserve" i.e a naturally breeding wild habitat providing all the essentials for normal pheasant population growth, then the things get tricky. There are a multitude of things you will need to consider:\n\n1. A suitable habitat\n2. availability of land in that suitable area\n3. fencing (at least 6 feet high with one foot each from top and bottom part folded to prevent digging / burrowing and climbing)\n4. Planting crops for cover (milo works best, wheat and sunflower are good too)\n5. Auto release pens\n6. Feeding mechanisms (it is essential that the birds do not have human contact as they have a tendency to become domesticated rather quickly, and hence cant protect themselves in the wild)\n7. [b]Predator control [/b] (specially during the nesting season)\n8. Your own availability\n9. a good .22 with a scope :D (those foxes and jackals will make a buffet out there i tell you )\n\nIt is very important that you give your own time to it as well. We achieved very little this year and the sole reason for that was the unavailability of either of us on the ground. The release dates / times are very tricky and if you miss a week, the birds wont survive. \n\nI hope i have not confused you so far :/\nanyways, I would prefer to have a one to one session with you on teh GTG. its really nice to hear that other ppl are interested in a similar conservation effort. :)\nBest,', ''),

Chukars, Quails and less frequently Grey/Hungarian partridges are often used as supplementary game-birds to the ring-neck on shooting preserves around the world. \n\nWhile i cant find a source that specifically says they can co-exist in the wild, there are plenty of examples of habitats where they DO co-exist both as released game-birds or as wild ones. \n\nSo to answer your question, if the habitat has sufficient nesting and roosting cover (pheasants and partridges share a very similar nesting pattern - both are ground nesting birds) and plenty of agricultural land (pheasants are much more sustainable near agricultural land with the availability of grain), i see no reason why they wouldn''t be able to co-exist.', ''),

I cannot advise firing slugs in such guns.\n\n[quote=AK47]\nSorry, if too many questions, but see, if you could segregate them, and let me hear from you kindly. Some of the questions perhaps require separate threads, since we''re discussing Baikal here, but I feel it''s still quite relevant here, instead of numerous new threads just being scattered around.

This is what I also knew but POF website describes 1Z weight as 12.56 grams which is equal to 193.83 grains and 2Z weight as 12.57 grams which equals 193.98 grains. Seems to be an error.[/quote]\n\nYou are right the mean weight of the cartridge shown on the POF site is confusing, here is reference link which have the detailed information of 9x19 cartridge standards.\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9x19mm_Parabellum[/url][/quote]\n\nhow can one deduce the bullet weight differences of 1z and 2z only by knowing the mean cartridge weight in both cases. 193.xx grain is the total weight of cartridge that includes casing, primer, powder charge and projectile. The only way to give solid comment is to weigh them on scale. As per former discussions on Mk2Z, senior reloaders have commented it 115 grain bullet.\nHowever there is another way to check, but that only gives a vague idea.. heavier 9mm projectiles tend to be longer than lighter projectiles or in other words they have visial differences in their Bullet Ogives. As far as my own observation is concerned, regarding 1z and 2z, there aren''t any such visial differences.\nPower wise, mk2z rates at 1225fps average, out of a g19''s 4 inch barrel (as chronographed by Skeeter sahib). It rates it among mid level +p round.[/quote]\n\nThanks for the correction Idrees Sahib. \n115 grains or 7.45 grams and 124 grains or 8.04 grams is the bullet weight of POF 1Z & 2Z respectively and not the mean cartridge weight.

(82010, ' Hasan Jamshad\n\nAs an exporter, we have special pricing on Winchester. However, if someone is interested in other brands from USA, we can look into the possibility of exporting.\n\nWhile the pricing looks very attractive on the shelf of Wal-Mart and other Sports goods stores like sports authority, Dicks'' sporting goods and local gun shops in USA, unfortunately it is not valid when it comes to export.\n\nFor Export/Import lot of other factors come in.  You have to go through a very tedious process of obtaining export license from USA govt and import license from Pakistani government. Pakistani Govt issues license for specific amount to person applying for a license. It takes lot of time and efforts of every kind to get the license.  To give you an example, I have applied license for a Tool used in Cement factories, which unfortunately looks like a gun and shoots loads to clear the blockage in rotary Kilns of the cement factories. This tool is used world over and enhances production and cuts down time of factories, gives more foreign exchange to the country because cement is exported to other countries. Despite my 7 months efforts, there is no end in sight.  \n\nAfter having gone through this process, then comes the pricing.  It is not only the price, freight is a killer too. Ammunition is a heavy stuff, special HAZMAT handling is required. Then comes the custom clearance at the destination. I know a dealer from Punjab, who imported ammunition through Karachi port, he had to go through hassle of extra documentation for a few months, after having done that, he was not allowed to bring it in a container to Punjab and had to sell it in the local market Karachi. Now he imports by air, and you can imagine the freight amount he has to pay.  The story does not end here. Govt of Pakistan charges all duties to importers on cost plus freight. I mean to say you have to pay the duties on Freight as well. \n\nI am not defending anyone, but just want to mention that the procedure is so difficult that the dealer who succeeds thinks like having crossed the bridge hell and heaven and exploits the situation to his advantage.', ''),

First concern is to "[b]pacify[/b]" any oncoming threat to [i]immobility[/i], never mind serious injury.\n\n2) [b]User is not a "regular shooter" of 12 gauge weapons,[/b] situation is [b]abrupt[/b], thus [i]unexpected[/i] and time for action is [b]short[/b], requiring [b]SURE FIRST-SHOT HIT[/b]!\n\n3) Count in the real life "[b]stress[/b]" of defender, at moment of [b]unexpected assault[/b] and necessity to go into action mode.\n\nReason why I''m giving these details, is simply because, in my humble opinion above described factors and situational conditions actually all happen to be the real scenario in SD situations in real life, with minimum time for action and high tension.\n\nWe usually give tips on basis of "theoretical" facts of [i]effectiveness[/i] of various forms of loads and ammo, and as such, course a "slug" running through the barrel of your gun would sure have the most of "hitting" and stopping power.

(82254, ' [quote]For close-in home defense situations, birdshot might work, but its use is not preferred.  Recommended shells include #4, BB, or larger hunting loads.  Fill the balance of the magazine with #3 buckshot for insurance, due its proven ability to penetrat\n\nAlthough birdshot is not as lethal as buckshot, even at close range, it may make sense for home or apartment defense where the opportunity exists to injure or kill innocent people behind thin walls in adjacent rooms.  For defending a single family home, buffered by land, 00 buck is preferred.  The choice for birdshot loads is BB or #4 birdshot.  Out to a range of 30 feet or so, birdshot is essentially a solid column of lead pellets.  Stopping power may not be sufficient, however, due lack of penetration potential.\n\nAt close range, birdshot can destroy a great deal of tissue, producing a gruesome wound.  The depth of the injury, however, will likely be six inches or less.  This is too shallow to reliably affect an assailant''s heart or major [/quote]\n\nThe first shot hit will only come after practice if the person is complete novice then first shot hit with a shotgun is difficult to sat the least.Whatever shell you use they will fire to pattern not wish so the novice unless points in the right direction before pulling the trigger will not get a hit.', ''),
(82255, ' Hawl bro.........You know I''ve always been against "permits" and unnecessary extras for carrying around with concealable items, with an exception for 144 permits if absolutely required.\n\nYet for PB weapons, and especially since they''re not quite "concealable", I favor a "carry lic", which is actually just a permit allowing you to carry your gun on journeys. Issued by the MOI. It mentions your gun number as well as MOI booklet number, allowing you to carry it around, yet still only in concealable manner, this means in the car, i.e, or covered when out in the open.', ''),
(82256, ' [quote]Some misconceptions may exist regarding the spread of shotgun pellets or balls.  It is not enough to merely point the shotgun in the general direction of an assailant and let fly.  Birdshot or buckshot does not create a huge cone of death and destruction that devastates everything in its path.  Rather, for a defense or "riot" shotgun with an 18- to 20-inch open choked "improved cylinder" barrel, the pellets will spread out about one inch for every yard of range traveled.  Across a large room of 18 feet or so, the spread will only be about 6 inches, a circle as big as a coffee cup saucer.  At 50 feet, the spread will only be about 16 inches, the size of a large pizza.  It is obvious from this information that a  shotgun blast will not incapacitate multiple assailants at close range.\n\nThe shotgun must be skillfully aimed and fired.  Aiming is just not quite as precise as that required for a handgun or autoloader to score multiple hits on an aggressor.  The massive firepower of the shotgun will likely produce a favorable outcome in any self defense encounter. [/quote]\n\nVery clear.', ''),

(keep in mind, this is panic situation and in close range).\n\n2- As per my opinion the #4 and possibly #5 pellet size and load, both are optimal for max damage but less lethal than SG, 1G, BB, AAA etc (any thing can be lethal if hit the vital organs) within 5-25 yds.\n\nHere is a 12 gauge shot comparison chart post by @Mig in post [url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2718[/url] \nI took the liberty to post it here.\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVNgQli][img]http://s4.postimage.org/NgQli.jpg[/img][/url]', ''),

(82393, ' I will try to present my understanding with examples that I think will resolve the question/discussion.\nWherever wrong, I wish to be corrected.\n\nIMHO:\n\nIn an SD situation, the life of attacker loses importance for the one defending.\n\nAs per my knowledge, also evident by the chart presented by @A.Abbas (thru @Mig), [i]more than anything else[/i], [b]the [u]size[/u] of game (the BG or attacker in this case), dictates the choice of the shell[/b].\n\nThe chances of hitting a human with a #4 or SG will not be much different because the spread diameter would be similar. Aiming properly will be imporatnt in each case.\n\nUsing shells with more+smaller shots does''nt mean that they will go flying everywhere. They will only fill a specific diamter which is a good thing for a small target but bad for a big one. That is because filling a similar spread is not as important with a bigger target as the power/distance of penetration (stopping power).\n\nIf you try to shoot down a dove at a certain distance with an LG (6 pellets), the chances of hitting it are slim not because of the spread, but because of the size of the game. The 6 pellets with tremendous stopping power are very likely to miss the bird.\n\nNow consider hitting the same bird at the same distance with a #8 Birdshot. The [u]chances of hitting increase exponentially[/u]. The spread diameter might be similar but the number of pellets (around 500) in the similar diameter and the size of pellets with appropriate penetration for the bird ensures the kill.\n\nSimilarly,\nIf you try to kill a reindeer with #6 birdshot or with a SG (9 pellets), the [u]chances of hitting does not improve[/u] with #6 due to the size of the animal and the stopping power is not likey enough. So in this situation a SG becomes a better option because the pellets that hit the animal are likely to stop it.\n\nNow what would you compare a human with?

(82397, ' [quote=Faisji][quote]Some misconceptions may exist regarding the spread of shotgun pellets or balls.  It is not enough to merely point the shotgun in the general direction of an assailant and let fly.  Birdshot or buckshot does not create a huge cone of death and destruction that devastates everything in its path.  Rather, for a defense or "riot" shotgun with an 18- to 20-inch open choked "improved cylinder" barrel, the pellets will spread out about one inch for every yard of range traveled.  Across a large room of 18 feet or so, the spread will only be about 6 inches, a circle as big as a coffee cup saucer.  At 50 feet, the spread will only be about 16 inches, the size of a large pizza.  It is obvious from this information that a  shotgun blast will not incapacitate multiple assailants at close range.\n\nThe shotgun must be skillfully aimed and fired.  Aiming is just not quite as precise as that required for a handgun or autoloader to score multiple hits on an aggressor.  The massive firepower of the shotgun will likely produce a favorable outcome in any self defense encounter. [/quote]\n\nVery clear.[/quote]\n\n[b]Agreed. 100%.[/b]', ''),

Chinese RED Box made by China North Industries Corp. Load "Not Given", Marked "311" and "07".\n\n2). Russian White Box made by TULA Cartridge Works or "TCW". Load "115 Grain", Marked "WOLF"\n\n3).

There were none, the whole session of 250 rounds + went smooth.\n\nAmmo report:\n\nI liked the Russian ammo the most, followed by the PolyTech. It made for good accurate firing with a medium kick. Red box ammo seemed more like a +p load and there was also more smoke after firing each shot. \n\nThe Poly Tech and the Blue Box Chinese are pretty much the same ammo only with different boxes. \n\nGiven a choice in this price range (Rs. 28-35) I would take Wolf over anything else.', ''),

I have extensively fired these two pistols as well as NP22 (around 2000 rounds with three of them). All three are good pistols in this price range but CF98 is certainly more accurate out of three, specially at longer ranges. Its light and easy to carry. HP77B is heavy and quite difficult to carry. I once carried it all day in a thigh holster and it was not a comfortable experience at all. With two full magazines, it was quite a weight.   \n\nBut as the shopkeeper told me about HP77B, " Sir je, Loha he loha.". On this criterion, HP77B certainly wins. NP22 has better finish than HP77B and is lighter in weight. \n\nAs for the prize, we all know in Pakistan its a market availability issue and does not necessarily indicate the difference in quality.

(82705, ' Salam,\n\nOn my last visit to punjab I saw a complete replica of the AK47... Guys it was PERFECT! The only catch is that it fires .22 bullets [b]AND IS SEMI AUTO!!![/b]... But that means that it can be bought on any NPB Licence. Has anybody else seen this? I saw a review of this gun on youtube sometime ago but i cant find it now. I was offered 60k for the gun from a dealer in Jhang. Lately I have wanted a gun with the looks of an AK.. \n\nThe question is: Would you guys go for this or just stick with the GSG-5 when taking into account the looks, and price difference. I dont really mind if it FTF FTE [b]SOMETIMES[/b]... because i want it for display and just to plink with. But it shouldnt get stuck more than once in two mags\n\nRegards.', ''),

(82797, ' [b]Review of Locally made SunShine No: 8.[/b]\n\nI would always prefer to test local ammo over anything imported where available. If anything locally made is half good we will promote it. \n\nYesterday we tested SunShine No#8 available for around Rs. 600 / box in a Winchester Defender 1300 and a Remy 870. The common complaints were bad primers resulting in failure to fire''s and in some cases the shells would get stuck in the barrel after firing. Reviews from all who have fired this cartridge in a semi have been negative so we did not try it in one. The dealer himself asked me to buy this only if I wanted to fire in a pump action or at the most a double barrel.  \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/SunS1.jpg[/img]\n\nHere are both tests:\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho88RGKEEgA[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmxDXM2qatM&feature=channel[/url]\n\n[u]Conclusion:[/u]\n\n[b]Do not use this ammo, it can cause your barrel to explode. [/b]\n\nThe only issue I personally had with it is the slight variation in gunpowder quantity from cartridge to cartridge. There is a about 20 %  variation, some have more, some less but on the upside they are more or less the standard # 8 load which is good. The pellets are fine, decently well even.\n\nFor semi auto''s and double barrels not recommended. \n\nRs. 600 is a little bit on the higher side for this ammo and that was mostly due to the shortage in the market in the past. Ideal price should Rs. 450 and the manufacture should actually market this product with better packing instead of trying to copy Shaheen.\n\nMore details and a discussion about SunShine can be found here:\n\n[url]http://www.pakguns.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2187[/url]', ''),

This is actually good news for those who are waiting for their licenses since several months. Inshallah those will get issued soon now. I too have two in the pipeline.\n\n=-=============================\n\nISLAMABAD - Due to bulk of pending applications for issuing arms licences, the Interior Ministry has stopped the process of receiving new applications for the next two months.\n\nAn official of the Interior Ministry told TheNation that during January and February, Interior Ministry would not receive new applications for arms licences. He said that during this period only pending applications would be processed. He also requested the people to collect their licences.\n\nWhen asked about the ban, he said that the 2-month long ban was imposed on the direction of Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.\n\nHowever, when asked about the number of pending applications, he said that he had not the correct figures.\nInterior Ministry has fixed a quota for parliamentarians to get arm licences. According to the quota each parliamentarian can get the licences of 20 non-prohibited bore per month and 25 prohibited bore in a year. The parliamentarians have been complaining against the delay in issuance licences while some of them also raised the point in National Assembly. It seems, as the decision of imposing ban on new applications was the result of such complaints.\n\nIt merits mentioning here that a large number of applications from parliamentarians and general public are pending with the Interior Ministry as earlier there was no fix quota for MNAs, MPAs and Senators.\n\nA case had also come on the surface in which some of the officials were reportedly involved in issuing fake arm licences of prohibited bore who were arrested by Federal Investigation Agency.', ''),

(82916, ' AoA Everybody.\n\n\nNice top AK47 and I was wondering why this topic hasnt popped up in this forum cause most other forums are plagued with this sorta topic and usually the participants endup running around in circles. so, lets keep it simple and straight.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. there is no such thing as a first shot kill or a first shot hit. u keep on shooting till somebody drops and drops for good.\n\n2. there is no such thing as humane pacification, in other words, make sure that the BG does not sue you back for the "use of excessive force". and i''m not talking about offering him a cup of tea.\n\n3. an assailant which has taken the chance of robbing you of ur property or life does not respect the value of your life or property and is always willing to gamble on your safety for his.\n\n4. you dont stop shooting when the bad guy drops. u stop shooting when the bad guy drops for good. or as FBI says it, stop when the assailant stops. in other words shooting is over when u ensure that the assailant is de-activated or in no more position to cause any harm.\n\n5. there is no such thing as inexperienced user. if he/she is so inexperienced he/she should better take up knitting. knit the BG a sweater while ur at it. its more humane to the assailant as well.\n\n6. an HD situation is a battle of wills. ur will to protect ur family and lose ur well being in the process againt his will to survive (fight or flee) by putting ur well being on the line. in any case the assailant is on the winning side. if he fights and wins, u lose and if he runs, he lives and wins hence u lose. the defender (the good guy) is always on the losing side. dont take my word for it. simply run a game theory analysis and u''ll find that his odds of winning will always be double than yours (remember zero sum game). the only way for you to win is to make sure that the BG is put down for good.\n\n7. No. 4 birdshot may lack the punch but it is very devastating for the tissue as it leaves it totally obliterated. something like mince meat. infact hit with a birdshot, the BG might survive but there will not be much to live for afterwards.\n\n8. owning a weapon alone does not give u the means to defend yourself or ur loved ones or ur property. owning then learning how to use it is the the total package. if u dont own a weapon, its alright, no problem, we call it NICE PEOPLE syndrome. but if u own a weapon and dont have the skills or the mental capacity to use it, now thats a problem, its called A$$ H@le syndrome. an active SSG buddy of mine once asked me, DOES HAVING A PECKER MAKES U A PLAYBOY? obviously not.\n\n9. only buckshots have the necessary punch (penetration, if u prefer a more technical approach) to cause an assailant significant harm, the sorta harm that can cause immediate seizure of an assault.\n\n10. there is no such thing as perfect defensive load. its just a matter of balancing punch with hit probability. both are inversely proportional to each other. when u increase the hit probability, the penetration (or punch) is reduced. in its truest sense, its a matter of personal preference, some like higher punch, others like higher hit probability and some like to balance somewhere in between. trick is to use the one that makes u most comfortable.\n\n11. never use slugs. slugs kill the very idea of a shotgun. better use a rifle if a single projectile tickles ur fancy.\n\n12. a shotgun is no cone of death, u still have to aim it. only practice can ensure that u aim it right. remember, buckshot (or birdshot) will not chase the BG back to his place. a good aim has no substitute.\n\nhaving said all that, and as per FBI study, the best shotgun load for home defense is 00 buckshot (96 % success rate) and No. 1 buckshot (90 percent success rate). the best state of mind for home defense is BOOMSHAKALAKA M@THERFU**ER. or better yet, duke nuke''em style: I''LL RIP UR HEAD OFF AND SH^T DOWN UR THROAT, the best shot count is that you keep on firing till the bad guy runs out of WILL or runs out of life. the best HD scenario is to announce ur ability of defending yourself with full force, then assert/display/advertise ur intentions by firing a warning shot then its SHOW-TIME baby!.\n\nkindly accept my apology for the profanity or if I sounded a bit rude. I feel that protocols and manners distort the actual information in such topics. we are not talking about getting a new car or a suit gentlemen, we are talking about gambling here. yes! gambling where lives are put on the line to protect lives/property. upside, u get to keep what is already urs and downside, u get to lose that u should not have lost. either way U LOSE. trick is to make sure that the FU**ER doesn''t get to enjoy his victory.\n\n\nRegards.', ''),

(83073, ' [quote]The most commonly used formula: "10% ballistic gelin", is prepared by dissolving 1 part gelatin into 9 parts of warm water (by mass), mixing the water while pouring in the powdered gelatin. It is chilled to 4° Celsius (39° Fahrenheit). An older formula used by NATO among others specifies a 20% solution, chilled to 10°C (50°F), but that solution costs more to prepare as it uses twice the amount of gelatin. In either case, a 1988 research paper recommends that the water should not be heated above 40°C (104°F), as this can cause a significant change in the ballistic performance.\n\nTo ensure accurate results, immediately prior to use, the gelatin block is "calibrated" by firing into it a standard .177 caliber (4.5 mm) steel BB, from an air gun over a gun chronograph into the gelatin, and the depth of penetration measured. While the exact calibration methods vary slightly, the calibration method used by the INS National Firearms Unit is fairly typical. It requires a velocity of 600 ± 10 f/s (183 ± 3 m/s), and a BB penetration between 3.25 and 3.75 inches (8.3 to 9.5 cm). 600 ft/s (180 m/s) is two to three times faster than the velocity of a BB propelled by a typical spring-air BB gun, and so where a typical BB gun might not penetrate the elastic skin of an animal, the higher velocity calibration shot will penetrate the gelatin more than might be expected.[/quote]\n\nPro tip: Try and find gelatin used in pharmaceutical products as that has the required hardness for ballistics use not the confectionery gelatin.\n\nThe hardness grade for gelatin is "bloom" to make ballistic gelatin you need 250 bloom level gelatin.Ordinary confectionery is between 75-200 bloom', ''),

This is actually good news for those who are waiting for their licenses since several months. Inshallah those will get issued soon now. I too have two in the pipeline.\n\n=-=============================\n\nISLAMABAD - Due to bulk of pending applications for issuing arms licences, the Interior Ministry has stopped the process of receiving new applications for the next two months.\n\nAn official of the Interior Ministry told TheNation that during January and February, Interior Ministry would not receive new applications for arms licences. He said that during this period only pending applications would be processed. He also requested the people to collect their licences.\n\nWhen asked about the ban, he said that the 2-month long ban was imposed on the direction of Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.\n\nHowever, when asked about the number of pending applications, he said that he had not the correct figures.\nInterior Ministry has fixed a quota for parliamentarians to get arm licences. According to the quota each parliamentarian can get the licences of 20 non-prohibited bore per month and 25 prohibited bore in a year. The parliamentarians have been complaining against the delay in issuance licences while some of them also raised the point in National Assembly. It seems, as the decision of imposing ban on new applications was the result of such complaints.\n\nIt merits mentioning here that a large number of applications from parliamentarians and general public are pending with the Interior Ministry as earlier there was no fix quota for MNAs, MPAs and Senators.\n\nA case had also come on the surface in which some of the officials were reportedly involved in issuing fake arm licences of prohibited bore who were arrested by Federal Investigation Agency.[/quote]\n\nlet''s hope for the best.', ''),

(83138, 'How to survive a Gunshot Wound This is for information only.But first aid saves lives.If someone you love or care about the first critical moments are vital if they are to survive the shooting and have a chance of recovery.\n\n[quote]1. Secure the Area \n\nBe sure you are not putting yourself or the victim at further risk -- you want to be as far away from the gunman as possible.\n\nIf the victim is armed, move the weapon several feet away and point it in a direction where accidental discharge will not result in further injury. Keep in mind that bullets will ricochet of solid objects.\n\n\n2. Immobilize the Victim\n\n Keep the victim still so as not to further aggravate injuries. Lightly support the victim''s head and keep it in alignment with the rest of the body.\n\n\n3. Treat Breathing \n\nIf the victim is unconscious, determine whether the victim is breathing. Check that the airway is clear, then tilt the head back and listen for breathing. If the victim is not breathing then initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation \n\n[CPR].\nCPR Steps:\n\n      i. Be sure the head is tilted back.\n      ii. Pinch nose and cover the victim''s mouth with yours and gently force air into the lungs until you see the victim''s chest rise.\n      iii. Give the victim 2 gentle breaths -- each breath should take 2 seconds\n      iv. If victim is still not breathing, coughing, or moving, then begin chest compressions. Rapidly push down on the victim''s chest 1 1/2 to 2 inches between the nipples. Do a set of 15 pumps over the course of 8-10 seconds then give the victim two more breaths.\n      v. Repeat process until victim regains consciousness or help arrives.\n      vi. Warning: Vomiting often accompanies CPR. Should the victim vomit, turn the head to the side and wipe off the vomit. Continue with CPR.\n      vii. Take special precautions if the victim has been shot in the chest.\n \n\n\n4. Assess and Treat Bleeding\n\n[b]Why Gunshot wounds may not bleed profusely.\nRemember gunshot wounds are serious. Just because they may not bleed profusely it doesn''t mean you are out of the woods yet.\n- Entry and exit wounds are often small.\n- Bullets rarely transect or sever major arteries and blood vessels\n- Surrounding tissue acts as a barrier to blood loss\n- As blood pressure falls, bleeding slows.[/b]\n\nWhile bleeding can be visually distressing it is one of the easiest problems to manage since treatment is straight forward. That said, gunshot wounds may not bleed profusely -- most of the damage is internal and inherently more serious than typical wounds. Bullet wounds are especially damaging because they penetrate deeply, take an unpredictable path through the body and are accompanied by a shock wave\n\nAs you treat the victim, bear in mind that almost 70% of gunshot victims survive. While victims who suffer gunshot wounds to the head or heart may succumb quickly, most will recover from wounds to other parts of the body.[/quote]', ''),

(83141, ' [quote]Steps to stop bleeding\n\n1. Remove clothing cover the wound so you can examine the source of blood -- i.e. exit and entry wounds.\n\n2. Apply pressure directly to the wound with the heel of your hand using the cleanest available bandage, sterile gauze pad, or cloth compress.\n\n3. Maintain pressure for a minimum of 10 minutes to allow several blood vessels to close by spasm and allow early blood clot formation. Do not peek at the wound as this will prolong bleeding.\n\n4. If available, apply cold ice packs over the compress to aid the closure of damaged blood vessels.\n\n5. If possible, get the victim to lie down and elevate the bleeding area above the level of the heart.\n\n6. If direct pressure fails to stop bleeding, check to see that you are applying pressure in the correct location. You should be pressing directly on the bleeding point.\n\n7. Try repositioning your pressure and hold again for another 10 minutes.\n\n8. Once bleeding has subsided, apply a pressure dressing. Cover the wound with the cleanest available bandage, sterile gauze pad, or cloth compress and wrap firmly with rolled gauze or elastic bandage. Do not apply dressing so tightly as to compromise circulation where the victim loses feeling in fingertips or toes.\n\n9. Watch dressing for blood soaking or dripping which could indicate continued bleeding.\n\n10. Should bleeding continue ...\n\nIndirect Pressure\n\n      If direct pressure fails to control bleeding or the plication of direct pressure is not possible, you may need to apply indirect pressure to the appropriate pressure point. This pressure point is a place where the main artery to the injured part lies near the skin surface and over a bone. Pressure applied at such a point -- using the fingers, thumb, or the heel of the hand -- can compress the artery against the bone and shut off the flow of blood from the heart to the wound. Important pressure points include:\n\n      Brachial pressure point -- Located on inner side of the upper arm. Press fingertips in between the muscles to compress the artery against the bone.\n\n      Femoral pressure point -- Lay the victim down with leg raised and knee bent to locate the groin fold on the forward-facing part of the upper leg. Press very firmly on the artery with thumbs.\n\n      Tourniquet\n\n[b]The decision to use a tourniquet may be the decision to sacrifice a limb to save a life.[/b] A tourniquet should be applied to the limb between the bleeding site and the heart, as close to the injury as possible and tightened just to the point where the bleeding can be controlled with direct pressure over the wound.\n\n      Constructing a tourniquet -- Use a 2- to 4-inch wide bandage that will not cut the skin. Wrap the bandage around the limb several times then tie a knot, leaving loose ends long enough to tie another knot. Put a sturdy stick or rod over the knot then tie it in place with a knot formed with the loose ends. Twist the stick until the bandage is tight enough to stop the bleeding then secure it. Every 10-15 minutes briefly release the tourniquet to see if it is still needed to control the loss of blood. As soon as bleeding stops, remove the tourniquet. \n\n11. After bleeding has ceased, immobilize the injury and regularly check all dressings to be sure that swelling has not caused tightness. [/quote]', ''),
(83142, ' [quote][b]Tips to Remember[/b]\n- Arterial bleeding [from severed arteries] can be recognized by spurting and rapid outflow. Veinous bleeding is considerably slower and more moderate.\n- External bleeding can almost always be stopped using pressure\n- Ice can help close damaged blood vessels and slow blood loss\n- A 25-30% loss on blood volume may result in shock\n- Using a tourniquet may result in amputation of the affected limb\n- Do not try to remove a deeply embedded object -- doing so may cause further bleeding.\n- Internal bleeding is very serious and often the only effective treatment is surgery\n- Signs of internal bleeding include firmness in the abdomen after injury, vomiting blood, blood in urine or feces, large bruises over the flank or abdomen, pale skin, cool and clammy skin, rapid heart rate, weakness, thirst, dizziness, shortness of breath.\n- If victim has bones or internal organs protruding do not attempt to push these back inside the body. Cover the exposed tissue with moist sterile cloth pr bandages. Seek immediate medical attention.[/quote]', ''),

But the taboo door has opened for me and the fear gone with my 1st lic ,so the goods will be getting in now or then \n\nnow the dumb question..any source from where i can get proper maintenance guidlines for akkar? any member who has one already? actually the shop keeper had explained briefly but out of excitement i couldnt absorb  . Also would anyone explain to me the function and proper usage of that button infront of trigger ? the shop keeper said it would eject the catridge if u dont want to fire and pump ... or something like that lol , respectfully this is my first gun so please bear me and kindly somebody explain to me some details for operating and maintaining akkar karatay taktik along with safety procedures.\n\nthanks once again.\nsohail', ''),

(83280, ' @ Denovo,\n\nThat is a very good idea. \n\nI too had thought about using something similar, but along the lines of those wooden boxes in which import consignments generally come. They are made of 3/4 inch to 1 inch thick compressed chipboard type material (but harder than our chipboard) and are something like 2 feet wide and 4 (or so) feet tall. Fill it with sand and you have yourself something safe to practice on. \n\nCurrently what I use is 6 layers of half inch think solid wood planks (no chipboards) nailed together to form a four feet by four feet back stop. In front of it I put old directories / promotional material / old-outdated tax ordinances / etc bound together with binding tape and an A4 printout of target pasted on it. These directories, etc are generally 6 to 8 inches thick. \n\nI''ve seen the 9mm chinese rounds penetrate these 6-8 inches and stopping one inch into the wooden planks (from 15 yards) while the 30 bore goes around 2 inches into the wood. I have yet to see a .22 penetrate the initial 6-8 inches think target.\n\nOn new year eve, from 15 yards, only four out of the 67 rounds fired (21 - 30 bore + 34 - 9mm + 12 - .22) landed outside the A4 target paper on the wooden planks behind it. I used eight such hard bound bundles to check the results and accordingly kept adjusting my stance, grip, breathing, trigger pull, etc.\n\nDanny, at your factory, you must be having lots of similar wooden boxes / crates and if I remember, you had some plans to make a makeshift range there for yourself. Add to this a sand mound as supplemental backstop for further safety. That mound of sand which Anthrax, SlayerJatt, etc had created as backstop for their GTG shoot would do the job.', ''),

Aside from that I use Winchester Super X rounds.  \nNow on to your gun, I will probably post a project tonight regarding the functioning of Walther.  When one pulls back on the slide there is a point where there seems to be a stiffer pull stage, this is due to the Hammer cut angle and it basically hangs against the bottom of the slide.

But I didn''t see any pistol in "Silver Finish". \n\n[b]Rizshu[/b] I''m really sorry that I wasn''t able to make the video. BUT, you can apply any pistol method of cleaning and lubricating the CF98. That''s how I maintained my pistol and found all the necessary information available on the internet. Once again, I''m sorry I wasn''t able to fulfill my promise. :(\n\n[b]Rameez:[/b] Only on the Internet. But I did see the Dolphin and Shark series in person at Buksh Elahi.  \n\n[b]Denovo:[/b] Sir, there''s no technique really. Just instinct! I remember you asked me something like this on my CF98 thread as well. Sorry that I never answered your question. :( I don''t own a fancy camera, just a Point and shoot 10MP FUJIFILM. The idea is to make the very best out of your lens. No matter what the quality of lens is. See example at the end of this post. \n\nBUT here are some techniques of my own: \n\n1. Always make sure that your pictures have one consistent background. For example, in this case, the yellow flag is only visible as the background in all the pictures (Except for the last one)\n\n2. Light depends. Ideally, I''d use natural sun light to shoot but at night, you can use your camera''s flash. But remember, if you''re going to use yellow light, make sure you have a LOT of it because it tends to smudge the pixels. \n\n3. Always take a LOT of pictures using your own technique of shooting. And obviously, select the very best out of the whole lot. This improves the chances of taking good shots. \n\n4. Aim low, and try to keep the background consistent as well. While aiming low, play around with different angles. While aiming low, make sure you''re camera is on Macro mode (Close up). \n\n5. Objects: Personally, I''d prefer all the items in a picture aligned to some direction. In easy words, everything should follow a straight angle. \n\n6. I seriously don''t know what I''m talking about :D\n\nEXAMPLE About camera lens: \n\nHere are some examples from my photography collection. The point I want to prove is that even with a low quality lens, one can get amazing results if used properly. \n\n[b]N73 3.2 MP:[/b] [url]http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v156/78/92/505654167/n505654167_138268_7131.jpg[/url] Perfect example of low shot with high aim. \n\n[b]N95 5MP: [/b] [url]http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v150/78/92/505654167/n505654167_158573_558.jpg[/url]\n\nAnd this shot won an Amature photography competition in Toronto.

(83677, ' .22 for boars is Not recommended. Under ideal conditions and at a very short range a well placed bullet in the spine or head may drop a small piglet or even a medium sized boar but a Tusker is a different ball game. Besides the boars do not pose with a smile and stay still as if to be photographed, they will be running or moving swiftly between bushes or crops and a shot can only be effectively placed in the shoulder or just behind it. \nShot placement with a shot gun is only possible at about 20-25 yds more than that and one can not predict if the  LG pellets will hit the vitals with surety. \nI would go with a reliable bolt action rifle with open sights or a low power scope of 2 or 3 and not more. The caliber should be 7mm, 308 or more and not less with heavy bullets of 160 grs or so in the 7mm / 7mm Mag and at least 165 grs in the 308 or the 30-06 and 150 gr bullets in the 270.\nI have seen two of my friends almost give up hunting a third was in hospital for three months and un able to do any physical activity for one year with a broken collar bone and three broken ribs and and the right leg done to him by a small boar after taking both barrels of LG/SG .The hunter is a very well known hunter from Islamabad and I can give his name after his permission. His son saved his life who was close by giving another two lg/sg s.\nThe other two were lucky they were attacked by sows one of the hunters is 6ft 4 and I saw him thrown in the air about 10 feet ; the other is also 6ft and very tough and was also thrown up and both refuse to go near a place where bushes are thick and they cannot see.\nA wild boar is a very dangerous animal and should never be taken lightly, I have seen and shot boars well in excess of 300 pounds.

(83709, ' [b]T-14 Compact S shotgun\n Safir arms[/b]\n\nType: semi-automatic\nGauge: [b].410 (36), 65 mm (2 1/2") chamber[/b]\nLength: 960 mm (860mm for collapsible butt "S" models)\nBarrel length: 510 mm (also 320 mm or 610 mm)\nWeight 2.6 - 2.7 kg\nCapacity:[b] 9, 10 or 15[/b] rounds in detachable box magazine\n\nThe T-14 shotgun was developed by Turkish company Safir Arms. It is broadly based on the famous Ar-15 / M16 rifle, but has several patented features necessary for reliable functioning with shotgun-type ammunition. At the present time it is offered in only one caliber, .410x65 (also known as 36 gauge, 2 /12 inch chamber). With .410 caliber bullet weighting 7.5 gram (116 grains) manufacturer claims muzzle velocity in 700 m/s (2,290 fps) range, providing muzzle energy of about 1,800 Joules (1,320 ft-lbs). The T-14 shotgun is semi-automatic only and is available in different barrel lengths to make it legal for civilian use in various countries that permit its citizens to own shotguns.\n\nThe T-14 shotgun is gas operated weapon with rotary bolt locking. The gas system utilizes annual (ring-type) short-stroke gas piston, located around the barrel. For maintenance and cleaning gas piston can be removed from the barrel after removing the front sight with its base. The bolt group externally resembles the Ar-15 bolt, but has redesigned bolt head with three radial lugs and ejector, optimized for rimmed shotgun shells. The receiver is similar in design to Ar-15 rifles, and made from aircraft-grade aluminum alloy and consists of two parts (upper an lower), connected by two cross-pins. Trigger unit and manual safety also resemble same units of the Ar-15 rifle. T-14 shotguns are produced either with integral, M16A2-type carrying handle and rear sight block, or with M16A3-type flat-top receiver with Picatinny rail. Furniture is made of plastic, and buttstocks are available either in fixed or in telescoped (M4-type) variety. Detachable box magazines are specially designed for rimmed shotgun ammunition', ''),

But with 9mm JHPs I know that the BG is ''going down'' and going down fast without too much worry of over penetration. Needless to say that ones aim has to be fairly good, but then that''s constant for both cases, 9mm as well as 30 bore.\n\nHope I was able to communicate my views clearly.:)\n\nPS: Yes, if I was on the offensive and trying to shoot down someone at 50+ Yards range, I would surely prefer a TT.

This ensures positive feeding, but this was done primarily to overcome feeding problems caused by poor standard of manufacture of the sheet metal stamped magazines.\nThe 9mm is much more power full with its 115 grain and 124 gr bullets whereas the 7.62x25 is speedier with its lighter bullets. The Range is in consequential as any pistol has a far greater range than a shooter can accurately shoot.\nAll pistols ( 4-5 inch barrel combat pistols) have a reasonable range  of about 25 meters and only seasoned shooters adopting proper kneeling position can hit targets well beyond it.\nThe 9mm is much more accurate so it has more effective range.\nThe TT pistol has a very limited effective life and becomes loose and breakages in parts start to occur  much  earlier than a 9mm .\nThe TT steel core bullets pass through the soft armour of Level 3A and Level 3 Bullet proof jackets , but the steel core bullets are now very hard to find as gradualy all manufacturers are now making lead core bullets. I have in my possession 9mm Bullets meant for Law enforcement only which are Tungsten Carbide with a neoprene Sabot the whole projectile is much lighter than the standard 115 but it goes at nearly twice the MV and goes through both sides of a bullet proof jacket of even level 4 with a gelatin block in between ( Soft Armour only ) This bullet goes neatly through 1/4 inches of soft steel.\nAll I want to say is that penetration is different from killing potential; and is function of the type of projectile being fired and the 9mm provides a very broad spectrum of effective choices.', ''),

(84046, ' You don''t understand. You updated your résumé, you''re applying to jobs every day, you''ve cleaned up your digital dirt and you network every day. Yet here you still are on the unemployment list. What is wrong with employers? \n\nUnfortunately, many job seekers don''t stop to consider that the problem might not be employers but themselves. \n\nIt''s a hard concept that most job seekers have trouble wrapping their heads around, but applicants frequently (and inadvertently) display signs that tell an employer that they''re not the best fit for the job. \n\nAccording to a 2009 CareerBuilder survey, 47 percent of employers said that finding qualified applicants is their biggest hiring challenge. When asked to identify the most valuable characteristics in new hires, employers cited multitasking, initiative and creative problem-solving.\n\nDo you lack what employers want? Yes, there are fewer jobs and there is more competition, but are you doing everything you can? Here are 10 reasons why employers might have passed you by.\n\n1. You lie\nAny lies you tell in your job search, whether on your résumé or in an interview, will come back to haunt you. In a 2008 CareerBuilder survey, 49 percent of hiring managers reported they caught a candidate lying on his or her résumé; of those employers, 57 percent said they automatically dismissed the applicant. Everything you tell an employer can be discovered, so it behooves you to be honest from the get-go. If you''re concerned about something in your past, invention is not the answer. Use your cover letter to tell your story, focusing on your strengths and accomplishments and explaining any areas of concern if needed.\n\n2. You have a potty mouth\nIt''s certainly tempting to tell anyone who will listen how big of a (insert expletive here) your current boss is, but a hiring manager for a new job is not that person. A 2009 CareerBuilder survey showed that 44 percent of employers said that talking negatively about current or previous employers was one of the most detrimental mistakes a candidate can make. Find a way to turn those negative things job into positives. If you can''t get along with your co-workers, for example, tell the prospective employer that you''re looking for a work environment where you feel like you''re part of a team and your current position doesn''t allow for that kind of atmosphere.\n\n3. You don''t show long-term potential\nEmployers want people in their organization to work their way up, so it''s best to show that you want to and can grow with the company. If you were asked where you see yourself in five years and you gave an answer that wasn''t related to the position or company you''re interviewing with, kiss your chances goodbye. Ask questions like, "What type of career movement do you envision for the most successful candidate in this role?" It shows that you have envisioned your future at the company. \n\n4. You have serious digital dirt\nSocial networking sites and online searches are the newest way that many employers are checking up on prospective hires. A 2009 CareerBuilder survey showed that 45 percent of employers use social networking sites to research candidates. Thirty-five percent of those employers found content that caused them to dismiss the candidate. Make sure to remove any photos, content or links that can work against you in an employer''s eyes.\n\n5. You don''t know ... well, anything\nIn two separate 2009 CareerBuilder surveys, 58 percent of employers said that coming to the interview with no knowledge of the company was a turnoff, and 49 percent said that not asking good questions cost candidates a job offer. Plain and simple, do your homework before an interview. Explore the company online, prepare answers to questions and have someone give you a mock interview. The more prepared you are, the more employers will take you seriously.\n\n6. You acted bored, cocky or disinterested\nA little enthusiasm never hurt anyone, especially when it comes to a potential new job. Forty-five percent of employers in a 2009 CareerBuilder survey said that the biggest mistake candidates made in the interview was appearing disinterested and 42 percent said appearing arrogant cost applicants the job. Every business wants to put their most enthusiastic people forward with important clients and customers, so acting the opposite will get you nowhere.\n\n7. You were a little too personal\nSeventeen percent of employers said that candidates who provided too much personal information in the interview essentially blew their chances at the job, according to a 2009 CareerBuilder survey. Not only does personal information offend some people, but anytime you talk about topics such as your hobbies, race, age or religion, you''re setting yourself up for bias. Though it''s illegal for employers to discriminate against applicants because of any of these factors, some will do so, regardless. \n\n8. You were all dollars, no sense\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should never bring up salary before the employer does. Doing so is tacky and makes the employer think that you care about the money involved, not about helping the employer succeed. If the topic does arise, however, be honest about your salary history. Employers can verify your salary in a matter of minutes these days, so lying only makes you look bad. \n\n9. You didn''t -- or can''t -- give examples\nHiring managers want people who can prove that they will increase the organization''s revenues, decrease its costs or help it succeed in some way. If all you give to an employer is a bunch of empty words about your accomplishments, you don''t demonstrate how you can help  the company. In fact, 35 percent of employers said that the most detrimental mistake candidates make is not providing specific examples in the interview. The more you can quantify your work, the better.\n\n10. You don''t have enough experience\nManagers don''t have as much time as they used to to train and mentor new employees. The more experience you have, the more likely you are to hit the ground running without a lot of hand-holding. The best way to show that you know what you''re doing is to give the employer concrete examples of your experience in a given job duty.', ''),

(84102, ' [quote=Skeeter60].22 for boars is Not recommended. Under ideal conditions and at a very short range a well placed bullet in the spine or head may drop a small piglet or even a medium sized boar but a Tusker is a different ball game. Besides the boars do not pose with a smile and stay still as if to be photographed, they will be running or moving swiftly between bushes or crops and a shot can only be effectively placed in the shoulder or just behind it. \nShot placement with a shot gun is only possible at about 20-25 yds more than that and one can not predict if the  LG pellets will hit the vitals with surety. \nI would go with a reliable bolt action rifle with open sights or a low power scope of 2 or 3 and not more. The caliber should be 7mm, 308 or more and not less with heavy bullets of 160 grs or so in the 7mm / 7mm Mag and at least 165 grs in the 308 or the 30-06 and 150 gr bullets in the 270.\nI have seen two of my friends almost give up hunting a third was in hospital for three months and un able to do any physical activity for one year with a broken collar bone and three broken ribs and and the right leg done to him by a small boar after taking both barrels of LG/SG .The hunter is a very well known hunter from Islamabad and I can give his name after his permission. His son saved his life who was close by giving another two lg/sg s.\nThe other two were lucky they were attacked by sows one of the hunters is 6ft 4 and I saw him thrown in the air about 10 feet ; the other is also 6ft and very tough and was also thrown up and both refuse to go near a place where bushes are thick and they cannot see.\nA wild boar is a very dangerous animal and should never be taken lightly, I have seen and shot boars well in excess of 300 pounds. I have seen a horse killed by a boar. Please do not go boar hunting with less gun; be prepared for the worst when shooting on foot in a drive or beat.[/quote]\n\nWell said sir, i agree 100% :)', ''),
(84103, ' [quote=PiranPir]cud''nt agree more with skeeter, i have shot some huge ones myself and I used to underestimate them until i saw one take 4 sg cartridges about six 223 bullets and numerous 9mm hollow point bullets and still he managed to sink his tusks in the side of my friends jeep. with the growing number of boars in my lands i have done all kinds of experimentation on them... i even shot one with a .22 in the head and the bugger dropped in an instant but as soon as i drove near him believe it or not he got up and ran in the nearest woods as if nothing had happened. best thing to shoot it with if u want to drop him dead at a range exceeding 30 yards is a bolt action rifle with the above mentioned calibers but shot placement is essential. i would also like to add here that i once shot a hogzilla with a 7mm magnum at 140 yrds or so but it hit him in the guts and the damm thing ran away with his intestines hanging out , im sure it dropped some time later...  my point is try not to use a SG/LG cartridge on a boar but if u dont have a choice then use a slug at short range and go for the head. warm regards and happy hunting[/quote]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq1tWcCr][img]http://s3.postimage.org/1tWcCr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nSain, this one took 2 Fiocchi buck shots , the shot placement can be seen clearly ...... so when are Salman and I getting an invite to exterminate some of these tuskers at ur lands :-) ????

(84205, ' [b]Not Getting Hired? 10 Reasons Why[/b]\n\nYou don''t understand. You updated your résumé, you''re applying to jobs every day, you''ve cleaned up your digital dirt and you network every day. Yet here you still are on the unemployment list. What is wrong with employers? \n\nUnfortunately, many job seekers don''t stop to consider that the problem might not be employers but themselves. \n\nIt''s a hard concept that most job seekers have trouble wrapping their heads around, but applicants frequently (and inadvertently) display signs that tell an employer that they''re not the best fit for the job. \n\nAccording to a 2009 CareerBuilder survey, 47 percent of employers said that finding qualified applicants is their biggest hiring challenge. When asked to identify the most valuable characteristics in new hires, employers cited multitasking, initiative and creative problem-solving.\n\nDo you lack what employers want? Yes, there are fewer jobs and there is more competition, but are you doing everything you can? Here are 10 reasons why employers might have passed you by.\n\n1. You lie\nAny lies you tell in your job search, whether on your résumé or in an interview, will come back to haunt you. In a 2008 CareerBuilder survey, 49 percent of hiring managers reported they caught a candidate lying on his or her résumé; of those employers, 57 percent said they automatically dismissed the applicant. Everything you tell an employer can be discovered, so it behooves you to be honest from the get-go. If you''re concerned about something in your past, invention is not the answer. Use your cover letter to tell your story, focusing on your strengths and accomplishments and explaining any areas of concern if needed.\n\n2. You have a potty mouth\nIt''s certainly tempting to tell anyone who will listen how big of a (insert expletive here) your current boss is, but a hiring manager for a new job is not that person. A 2009 CareerBuilder survey showed that 44 percent of employers said that talking negatively about current or previous employers was one of the most detrimental mistakes a candidate can make. Find a way to turn those negative things job into positives. If you can''t get along with your co-workers, for example, tell the prospective employer that you''re looking for a work environment where you feel like you''re part of a team and your current position doesn''t allow for that kind of atmosphere.\n\n3. You don''t show long-term potential\nEmployers want people in their organization to work their way up, so it''s best to show that you want to and can grow with the company. If you were asked where you see yourself in five years and you gave an answer that wasn''t related to the position or company you''re interviewing with, kiss your chances goodbye. Ask questions like, "What type of career movement do you envision for the most successful candidate in this role?" It shows that you have envisioned your future at the company. \n\n4. You have serious digital dirt\nSocial networking sites and online searches are the newest way that many employers are checking up on prospective hires. A 2009 CareerBuilder survey showed that 45 percent of employers use social networking sites to research candidates. Thirty-five percent of those employers found content that caused them to dismiss the candidate. Make sure to remove any photos, content or links that can work against you in an employer''s eyes.\n\n5. You don''t know ... well, anything\nIn two separate 2009 CareerBuilder surveys, 58 percent of employers said that coming to the interview with no knowledge of the company was a turnoff, and 49 percent said that not asking good questions cost candidates a job offer. Plain and simple, do your homework before an interview. Explore the company online, prepare answers to questions and have someone give you a mock interview. The more prepared you are, the more employers will take you seriously.\n\n6. You acted bored, cocky or disinterested\nA little enthusiasm never hurt anyone, especially when it comes to a potential new job. Forty-five percent of employers in a 2009 CareerBuilder survey said that the biggest mistake candidates made in the interview was appearing disinterested and 42 percent said appearing arrogant cost applicants the job. Every business wants to put their most enthusiastic people forward with important clients and customers, so acting the opposite will get you nowhere.\n\n7. You were a little too personal\nSeventeen percent of employers said that candidates who provided too much personal information in the interview essentially blew their chances at the job, according to a 2009 CareerBuilder survey. Not only does personal information offend some people, but anytime you talk about topics such as your hobbies, race, age or religion, you''re setting yourself up for bias. Though it''s illegal for employers to discriminate against applicants because of any of these factors, some will do so, regardless. \n\n8. You were all dollars, no sense\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should never bring up salary before the employer does. Doing so is tacky and makes the employer think that you care about the money involved, not about helping the employer succeed. If the topic does arise, however, be honest about your salary history. Employers can verify your salary in a matter of minutes these days, so lying only makes you look bad. \n\n9. You didn''t -- or can''t -- give examples\nHiring managers want people who can prove that they will increase the organization''s revenues, decrease its costs or help it succeed in some way. If all you give to an employer is a bunch of empty words about your accomplishments, you don''t demonstrate how you can help  the company. In fact, 35 percent of employers said that the most detrimental mistake candidates make is not providing specific examples in the interview. The more you can quantify your work, the better.\n\n10. You don''t have enough experience\nManagers don''t have as much time as they used to to train and mentor new employees. The more experience you have, the more likely you are to hit the ground running without a lot of hand-holding. The best way to show that you know what you''re doing is to give the employer concrete examples of your experience in a given job duty.', ''),

(84209, ' [b]What Makes a Gunlover? [/b]\n\nI got to thinking today... just what is it that makes me love guns so much? When a friend mentioned that he knew a fellow who was considering selling or trading a rifle, I started to feel it - that deep-down gotta-have-it feeling. But why? I don''t need another rifle. I don''t have an excess of cash lying around, just waiting for a gun to buy. But something in me wants to own that gun.\n\nIt''s not just that gun, either. I like to tell folks that I want at least one of each... meaning one of every make, every model of gun ever built, of course. Such a statement is met with a variety of responses, from tolerant smiles to head-cocked, eyebrow-raised wonder. What most folks fail to grasp is that I mean it!\n\nI suppose that I can blame a good part of it on my raising. After all, my Dad''s a gunlover, too. Where he got the bug is hard to say, since his father only kept enough guns around for utilitarian purposes, such as defending himself while working in Chicago during the Great Depression, or dispatching a hawk before it ate all his chickens. But Dad got the itch somewhere along the line, and it surely has been passed on to me.\n\nI don''t hunt everything that walks or flies, so claiming to need a different gun for each game animal doesn''t cover it. I have a .44 magnum carbine for hunting deer out to 100 yards, a 30-30 for medium range deer hunting if need be, and a .338 Winchester magnum for reach-out-and-touch-them hunting. With handloads, I can load that .338 down for deer hunting, or up to handle any big game on this continent. I have a .222 Remington for shooting targets and varmints, .22 long rifles for small game, plenty of handguns. So why do I get excited about a rifle I''ve never seen in 7mm Remington Magnum? I really don''t know.\n\nThe bottom line is, it''s a gun. I long ago adopted my father''s motto: "If it shoots, I like it." Some are better than others, of course, but they''re all good. And I''m told by a reputable source that this gun is a shooter. The late Frank de Haas has given this make and model his unique stamp of approval via his excellent book, Bolt Action Rifles. And I don''t have a rifle chambered for 7mm Remington Magnum - which I find to be the second most compelling reason to buy it. The most compelling reason of all, of course, is that I want it.\n\nI guess I really don''t know what it is that makes me love guns so much. I love to make them accurate, I love to shoot them, and I love to carry them in the woods. I love to work on them, fix them if they break, clean them if they''re dirty. I love to admire them, touch them, see how they work. I''ve touched up bluing, built parts from scratch, refinished stocks, and made pistol grips, loving every minute of it. I love guns like some folks love fishing rods, others love cars, and still others go nuts for football. Why? I reckon it really doesn''t matter why we love what we do. We just do, that''s all.\n\nRuss Chastain', ''),

(84221, ' [b]The Master (Good to read) [/b]\n\nWhen one Guru  was dying, one of his deciple asked him "Guruji, who was your master?"He said, "I had thousands of masters. If I just relate their names it will take months, years and it is too late. But three masters I will certainly tell you about.\n\nOne was a thief. Once I got lost in the desert, and when I reached a village it was very late, everything was closed. But at last I found one man who was trying to make a hole in t he wall of a house. I asked him where I could stay and he said ''At this time of night it will be difficult, but you can say with me - if you can stay with a thief''.And the man was so beautiful. I stayed for one month! And each night he would say to me, ''Now I am going to my work. You rest, you pray.'' When he came back I would ask ''Could you get anything?'' He would say, ''Not tonight. But tomorrow I will try again, God willing.'' He was never in a state of hopelessness, he was always happy.\n\nWhen I was meditating and meditating for years on end and nothing was happening, many times the moment came when I was so desperate, so hopeless,that I thought to stop all this nonsense. And suddenly I would remember the thief who would say every night, ''God willing, tomorrow it is going to happen.''\n\nAnd my second master was a dog. I was going to the river, thirsty and a dog came. He was also thirsty. He looked into the river, he saw another dog there -- his own image -- and became afraid. He would bard and run away, but his thirst was so much that he would come back. Finally, despite his fear, he just jumped into the water, and the image disappeared. And I knew that a message had come to me from God: one has to jump in spite of all fears.\n\nAnd the third master was a small child. I entered a town and a child was carrying a lit candle. he was going to the mosque to put the candle there.\n\n''Just joking,'' I asked the boy, ''Have you lit the candle yourself?'' He said,\n\n''Yes sir.'' And I asked, ''There was a moment when the candle was unlit, then there was a moment when the candle was lit. Can you show me the source from which the light came?'' And the boy laughed, blew out the candle, and said, ''Now you have seen the light going. Where has it gone? You will tell me!''\n\nMy ego was shattered, my whole knowledge was shattered. And that moment I felt my own stupidity. Since then I dropped all my knowledgeability.\n\n\n\nIt is true that I had no master. That does not mean that I was not a disciple\n\n-- I accepted the whole existence as my master. My Disciplehood was a greater involvement than yours is. I trusted the clouds, the trees. I trusted existence as such. I had no master because I had millions of masters I learned from every possible source. To be a disciple is a must on the path. What does it mean to be a disciple? It means to be able to learn. to be available to learn to be vulnerable to existence. With a master you start learning to learn.\n\n\n\nThe master is a swimming pool where you can learn how to swim.

His owner has chosen not to have him put down, but has made a good home for him. This alone is amazing.\n\nListening, one will hear the sound of a bell. Looking around for the source of the sound, one will see that it comes from the smaller horse in the field. Attached to her bridle is a small bell. It lets her blind friend know where she is, so he can follow her.\n\nAs one stands and watches these two friends, one sees how she is always checking on him, and that he will listen for her bell and then slowly walk to where she is, trusting that she will not lead him astray.\n\nLike the owners of these two horses, God does not throw us away just because we are not perfect or because we have problems or challenges. He watches over us and even brings others into our lives to help us when we are in need. Sometimes we are the blind horse being guided by God and those whom he places in our lives. Other times we are the guide horse, helping others see God.', ''),
(84224, ' [b]Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life?[/b]\nYears ago, a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast.\n\nHe constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic . They dreaded the awful storms that raged across the Atlantic , wreaking havoc on the buildings and crops.\n\nAs the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received A steady stream of refusals.\n\nFinally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached the farmer. "Are you a good farm hand?" the farmer asked him. "Well, I can sleep when the wind blows," answered the little man.\n\nAlthough puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help, Hired him. The little man worked well around the farm, busy from dawn to dusk,  and the farmer felt satisfied with the man''s work.\n\nThen one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore. Jumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand''s sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and yelled, "Get up!  A storm is coming! Tie things down before they blow away!"\n\nThe little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, "No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows."\n\nEnraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm.\n\nTo his amazement, he discovered that all of the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins. The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred.\n\nThe shutters were tightly secured.  Everything was tied down.\nNothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep while the wind blew.\n\n******\n\nWhen you''re prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically, you have nothing to fear. \n\nCan you sleep when the wind blows through your life?', ''),

(84264, ' [b]Foods that Might Trigger Heartburn and Thus MUST be Avoided [/b]\n\nHeartburn is a typical burning sensation in the chest that causes extreme discomfort to the person. Though the causes of heartburn vary, a tentative idea suggests that certain kinds of foods can also trigger heartburn. This problem can therefore be prevented or controlled by understanding the type of foods that might trigger heartburn.\n\nHeartburn – an Overview:\n\nHeartburn can be the result of several causes. However, the most common cause of heartburn is GERD or acid reflux. Many people suffering from acid reflux experience heartburn as one of the many symptoms that this disease produces. The burning sensation is the result of the gastric juices in the stomach going back of refluxing to the esophagus. This movement causes a burning sensation in the chest along with significant amount of pain. The main reason why many believe that there is a link between heartburn and food is that, heartburn takes place typically after a meal and especially at night after a heavy meal. Typically, food that might trigger heartburn includes fatty food, oily and greasy concoctions, meat, salty food, spicy food and even certain types of fruits and vegetables. Besides this, certain types of foods are also held responsible for triggering acid secretion including tomatoes, chocolate, peppermint and other types of citric fruits including lemon.  \n\nLink between Food and Heartburn:\n\nWe all experience significant distress after a large meal. This is especially true if this meal is fatty, oily and spicy. This is because; this type of meal is very difficult to digest, especially if it is not followed by some kind of physical activity. If you are suffering from GERD, you will get more than just stomach uneasiness. You will immediately get some or all the symptoms of GERD, including heartburn. There are several reasons why this type of food can trigger heartburns.    \n\n1) Evidence suggests that certain types of foods that might trigger heartburn do so, by weakening the LES or lower esophageal sphincter, which is located at the bottom of the esophagus. The LES is mainly responsible for preventing the acid to flow back in the esophagus by closing the closing the one-way valve from esophagus to stomach.     \n\n2) Sometimes, more than what you eat, how much you eat also matters. Many people experience heartburn after a particularly large meal. Hence, mostly people experience heartburn after attending a scrumptious party or a lavish wedding. This happens, as it is difficult to difficult to digest a big meal, which is especially rich in nature. \n\n3) Limited water intake after having a meal cal also increase or trigger heartburn. People usually substitute water with a glass of soda and even worse with alcohol. Therefore, if you don’t drink water after consuming food that might trigger heartburn, you are heading for big trouble. Water flushes off toxins and eases digestion. Hence, water intake should be increased to prevent heartburn relapse.\n\nThere are many other types of foods that might trigger heartburn. However, they tell only half the story. To understand the problem and to seek a solution, you can consult a holistic treatment practitioner to help you have a sound diet plan to control heartburn and prevent its reoccurrence in the future.', ''),

(84323, ' Well here is one guy who sold the 92FS and later bought a PT 99. There were two reasons for selling the 92FS. \n\n1. It would shoot 2 to 3 inches low at 15 yards with its fixed sights with various brands of ammo and even with my handloads of varying weights and velocities. \n\n2. The 92 FS could not be carried cocked & locked. \n\nThe PT 99 shoots right at the Point of Aim at 15 meters, as it came out of the box without ever having to adjusts its adjustable sights. \n\nMy old Galco Miami Classic holster which I had for the 92FS takes the PT99 with its Rails quite well. And on top of all this I can carry my PT 99 Cocked & Locked! (My favourite mode of carry). Leaving finishes aside, the PT 99 (like the 92FS) shoots every time the triggger is pulled no matter what you feed in, and more importantly to my point of aim. Have only fired some two rounds yet but without experiencing any jams, misfeeds or extraction problems. My son was absolutely thrilled on hitting empty Marlboro packs at 10 meters which he cannot yet manage with a .45 ACP gun.\n\nSold the 92 FS Stainless after having it for 5 years and shooting some 2000 rounds for Rs 180,000 and bought the new Taurus at nearly one third of that money! The PT 99 does has some machining marks on its barrel locking piece but who cares. \n\nAs far as I am concerned, the PT 99 turned out to be a better gun than the 92 FS.

(84551, ' Hello everyone. This is Sikandar Pasha from Lahore. After staying away from guns for over 10 years, my hands started itching for a new 1911 and while surfing the net for it, I bumped into Pak Guns yesterday. Quickly went through the forums posts till past midnight but did not see anyone I knew from the 1990s. \n\nBut on the other hand was delighted to see so many knowledgeable gun lovers on this forum. The major change that I notice is that guns from Turkey and China have become hot favorites. During the eighties and the nineties the gun-world of Lahore was really small and some 10 to 15  odd gun-nuts would get together at the cavalry ground range and shoot their hearts out. This was a period when N.I.B Glocks & Berettas sold for 45 K and handgun ammo was real cheap, but we still reloaded it for the heck of it. Though rifle ammo reloading was a must for every sharpshooter. In 1995, a dear friend of mine brought 12000 rounds of .45 ACP military surplus from Aseel Khan in Darra at Rs 6 each and we all got our due share. (I may still have a couple of sealed steel boxes lying around somewhere in the house). In comparison, the POF 9 mm sold for Rs 7 a round. Now I see on the forum that .45 ACP ammo costs Rs 100 each! I am going to my reloading room right now (which has been slowly taken over by my wife) and will try to dust out my Rock chucker press and related goodies after 10 years.\n\nI dont know why the likes of Rohail Nana, Col Javed Omar & Major Amanullah who are gurus of our part of the gun-world are absent from this forum. Rifle nuts like Waqar Saigol are also missing besides so many other collectors and drawing room shooters from the old days who never ever fired a single shot but could brag about a particular gun or their favorite loads till dawn.\n\nThis website is a commendable team effort and is to be encouraged at all costs. Keep up this good work of bringing the Pakistani shooting community together. Warm regards to everyone. Sikandar Pasha', ''),

(84587, ' What is the difference? Lots of folks have wondered about that. And there are lots of other 9mm cartridges around, too, which can be confusing.\n\nAnswer: The short answer is this: None. They are simply two different names for the same cartridge. And 9x19mm is another name for it - as is 9mm NATO.\nWhether you call it the 9x19mm, 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, or 9mm NATO, it''s the same cartridge. Same size, that is. Some military ammo is loaded hotter, and/or with harder primers, for use in submachineguns. Such ammo should be avoided for use in your average 9mm pistol.\n\nNow, I don''t mean to oversimplify things here. There are a host of other 9mm cartridges, which are not the same. These include the 9mm Action Express, 9mm Bayard Long, 9mm Browning Long, 9mm Centerfire (which is actually a shotgun shell, if you can believe it), 9mm Makarov, 9mm Ultra, 9mm Winchester Magnum, just to name a few.\n\nIt''s worth reiterating that the cartridges in the preceding paragraph are not the same as the cartridge which is the subject of this article, which many shooters refer to simply as "the nine," or "nine millimeter." Those cartridge names, again, are 9x19mm, 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, and 9mm NATO, and they all describe the same cartridge. \n [b]"parabellum" means "prepare for war." [/b]', ''),

In order to remain in place, a belly band must be extremely tight; this is generally uncomfortable - it is comparable to wearing a girdle. \n\n[b]Pocket holsters[/b] are used for very small weapons, such as a back-up gun or a mousegun. \nSmall of Back holsters place the weapon directly over the center of the back, allowing for even large handguns to be carried with little printing. While both comfortable and stylish, should the wearer fall onto the weapon (such as in a close quarters fight) serious spinal injury (including paralysis) may occur. For this reason, in recent times many police departments in the US have disallowed any equipment, gun, handcuffs, etc, to be worn in this position. \nGroin holsters place the handgun mostly below the waistline around the 12:00 position. There are no body movement restrictions and very few clothing restrictions with this holster type. \nThigh holsters are a popular military and police item that holds the sidearm on the leg right where the hand naturally hangs, making for a relatively fast draw. Early U.S. cavalry units used these in the early 1900s with a leather thong strapping it to the leg. Modern ones often use a drop leg PALS grid with a modular holster attached. Often with buckles for quick release. Police and military members personnel these when a bulky vest makes belt carry impractical. \nAnkle holsters offer excellent concealment and are used often by law enforcement officials who wish to carry a secondary weapon to back up their primary firearm. \n\n[b]Chest holsters[/b] can be attached to MOLLE compatible vests and chest carriers. Like shoulder holsters, chest holsters are often easier to draw from than belt holsters when the operator is seated inside a vehicle. \n\nOther, specialized types of holsters are designed to be mounted inside briefcases, day planners, purses and filofaxes, or even articles of clothing.\n\nWhen choosing a holster for a firearm, factors of interest include:\n\n[b]Safety[/b] - a well designed holster will provide protection to the handgun during insertion into or removal from the holster or while being carried that will: 1. prevent accidental trigger movement; 2. prevent accidental disengagement of the safety mechanism; 3. prevent forward or rearward movement of the hammer. These features will vary greatly as applicable to the action of the handgun. The safety features of a holster very much require that the holster be engineered and designed for each specific manufacture and model of handgun. \nRetention - a holster designed with retention in mind will help prevent a gun from being removed from the holster by anyone other than the person wearing it. Modern duty holsters have multiple hidden retention devices to this end. Frequently, retentive holsters are custom designed for a specific model of gun. \n\n[b]Concealment [/b]- it is often desirable not to alert other people of one''s being armed. A carefully designed and worn holster can make a gun virtually invisible. Almost all concealment holsters are designed to be worn with a covering garment that is part of the wearer''s everyday attire. \n\n[b]Comfort[/b] - ability to wear a gun for an extended period without excessive discomfort. \n\n[b]Finish[/b] - a well designed holster should not snag a pistol or excessively abrade its finish. \n\n[b]Draw ease [/b]- practical shooting holsters allow a gun to be presented quickly, but drawing ease is often compromised in concealed carry \n\n[b]Durability[/b] - ability to withstand abuse and long-term usage without mechanical failure or impaired performance \n\n[b]Ease of reholster[/b] - a rigid holster will allow a gun to be returned to it with one hand, while a flexible one may collapse after the gun is drawn, requiring the use of both hands to reholster. \n\n[b]Adjustability[/b] - a holster that provides for the adjustment of gun cant and position can aid in both comfort or concealment. \n\n[b]Price -[/b] modern holsters for a $500 handgun can cost $20 to $200. Some users will require multiple holster types per gun, while others may prefer a generic holster for carrying multiple gun types.', ''),
(84601, ' [b]Leather Treatment for a Pistol Holster[/b]\n\nLeather holsters should hold the firearm in a firm position, but not too firm for a difficult removal of the pistol. The leather must be kept properly maintained for optimum performance of the holster. Neat foot oils or mink oils should be avoided as these products can make the leather holster too supple. The soft leather may have a difficult time holding onto the pistol. \n\n\n[b]Leather Break In[/b]\n\nRemove all ammunition from the firearm before fitting the pistol into the holster for the first time. Breaking in the holster may be necessary if the pistol fits too tight within the leather. While holding the holster in your left hand, insert two fingers of the right hand into the opening. Beginning two inches down from the top rim, push outward with the right-hand fingers to stretch out the leather. Continue this process until you have worked all around the perimeter of the leather holster and as far down into the holster as possible. Insert the unloaded pistol into the holster and check the fit. Repeat the process as many times as necessary for a correct fit of the pistol to the leather. \n\n\n[b]Cleaning[/b]\n\nOccasionally the leather holster will need cleaning. In times where the holster is in contact with body perspiration, cleaning may have to occur on a monthly basis. Remove the firearm from the holster and any straps or belts attached to the holster. Use a hard bar glycerin soap and a soft cloth. Work the soap into a soft lather onto the cloth with warm water. Rub the soapy cloth against the leather. Work the lather into any deep crevices and stitching. Perspiration can over time affect and weaken the stitching. There are special leather soap lotions available that can be worked directly into the leather. Allow the leather to air dry. Do not apply any type of artificial heat to the leather. Replace the firearm as soon as the holster is fully dry. \n\n[b]Things Not to Do[/b]\n\nKeep the holster out of any submerged liquids. When this condition occurs remove the firearm immediately and dry the leather with a clean cloth. Allow the holster to dry naturally. Do not place the holster in direct sunlight such as the dashboard of a vehicle. The sun can crack and prematurely dry out the leather. The use of Neat foot oils or mink oils will soften the leather to a point of loosening the grip onto the firearm. These types of oil applications are discouraged.', ''),

The Lee-Enfield No. 4 series rifles that were converted to 7.62 mm NATO were re-designated as the L8 series of rifles with the rifles being refitted with 7.62 mm NATO barrels, new bolt faces and extractor claws, new rear sights and new 10-round 7.62 mm NATO magazines that were produced by RSAF Enfield and Sterling Armaments to replace the old 10-round .303 British magazines.

(84711, ' [quote=Skeeter60]\n\n7mm Rem Mag is slightly faster and more powerful than the 7x64. 7mm Rem Mag has become a standard with which modern Rifle cartridges are compared for velocity and energy. In countries like Germany and Switzerland the 7x64 Brenneke is more popular for obvious reasons.\n7mm Rem Mag is my favourite cartridge I have four rifles, one custom built by Arnold with a Kreagor barrel and Mcmillan kevlar stock, the action is Rem 700 with a mod 70 Win style safety and a Sako extractor, it is tack driver, the other one is a Rem 700 from the  Remington custom  shop, the third is a normal 700 Rem and the 4th one is by Holland & Holland made in 1978\nI reload for these and although the factory 150 gr bullet goes at about 3150, my hand loads sizzle along at about 3225; I shoot the 160 gr bullets at about 3100 which makes the rifles kick but these loads are wonderful at long ranges when used in the mountains on  Himalayan Ibex or such like animals.

Topak quoted the law- read it, learn it.  Being within the law is what keeps you out of trouble first.\n2- The attitude of local police and prosecutors.  It''s one thing to be within the law, and another if the local police don''t know it, don''t care about it, or believe that non-police shouldn''t have a gun.\n3- The attitude of the population from which your jury pool will be drawn.

(84756, ' The Ghost TR01 is a compact semi-automatic pistol designed by Ucyildiz Arms (Akdal Arms) of Turkey. It was designed as a pistol for security and law enforcement personnel rather than the military market. The TR01 is very much like the Glock 17 and shares very many similarities. The Turkish armed forces prefer to use the Yavuz 16 which has recently passed military trials and is in service with a few regiments. The TR01 was introduced in 1990 and continues to be produced.\n\nThe Akdal has been designed with high ergonomic quality with a comfortable grip and well balanced weight. The TR01 uses a short recoil operated locking breech mechanism which is also seen in Glock 17s. The locking breech is based on the Glock 17''s Browning model in which the barrel engages the slide with a single lug, entering the ejection window.[1] The pistol utilises a pre-cocked striker, which takes some of the workload off the shooter by allowing the trigger to be pulled less to fire off a shot.\n\nThe pistol has several safety mechanisms to prevent a misfire or accidental discharge. These include a trigger safety, a firing pin safety, decocking indicator and a chamber indicator.[1] The rounds in the magazine are double stacked which means that they are less likely to jam, as sometimes occurs in fully loaded single stacked magazines, due to increased pressure on the spring.\n\nThe sights for the pistol are fixed, but a Picatinny rail can be fitted in front of the trigger guard or in front of the ejection port for a laser or Aimpoint sight. Finally, the stock is made of lightweight polymer and the barrel has six right hand rifling grooves.\n\nSource: [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akdal_Ghost[/url] :)', ''),

Firm specialized at the export deliveries of weapon, ammunition, ammunition. At the beginning of the 20th century the branches of house acted in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Magdeburg, Nuremberg, [Lippshtadte], and also abroad. After creating for the poor German hunter cheap gun, developers attended to by its design vitality and by reliability. First, the box of gun is very durable because of the absence in the pillows of long grooves for positioning the [vzvoditeley]. In the second place, lock system is designed exceptionally competently, what you will not meet even in the expensive guns, namely: the stems of gun are locked by the single lower lath, which goes in the turning of rear [podstvolnogo] hook. Front hook serves is only for the suspension trunk on the fulcrum. Finally, the locks of gun relate to the type of [udarnikovykh], have the crashproof spiral firing pin springs.

May you live another 100 years.\nNow when ever you are shooting a pistol on target; please ensure you do not have a small aiming point. This will create un necessary stress on you to align perfectly with the little dot. Have a dinner plate size aiming mark and you will be rewarded with small centered groups if you do other basics right.\nThat is why you see large aiming marks on targets used in matches/training. \nAll shooters have hands that move when aiming a pistol, let that movement continue it will gradually reduce with regular excercise and training on the range.\n Align your sights perfectly and get a good squeeeeeze of the trigger irrespective of where your sights were at the time the shot broke.\nFollow through and recover on target again. You must learn breath control and stop breathing as you raise your hand for a deliberate single shot, if you do not fire within 7 seconds lower your hand and repeat after a in hailing and ex hailing a few times. For Rapid fire the technique is different. Come over on one of the week ends and we will shoot Deliberate and and also Rapid.', ''),

The pistol will soon be launched in the local market.[/quote]\nSir, reverse engineering is normally required for something for which technical information / technology transfer is not available.\n\nTT is probably the most widely manufactured pistol in our local arms industry since decades.  Could you please explain what makes the TT manufactured by your company different from other local TTs. Better metallurgy, better finish, quality control etc ? Moreover, please also mention if there are any other sporting weapon manufacturing projects being undertaken, like shotguns, airguns of good quality, etc. \n\nthanks and regards', ''),

Most shooters can put together 7 - 10 shots which represent the best he can do.  Make him shoot 50 - 100 rnds and you''ll see his true skill.  This applies to every shooter.  You''ll see my fliers and mistakes in the images below.\n\nI took the 97 rounds I had on hand (230 grn lead round nose, powered by 4.2 grns of Titeground, seated to 1.255") and shot them at 15 paces.  I was standing, two handed, unsupported.  I used my Kimber Supermatch II.\n\nI shot at a USPSA metric target.

No, no, no, not at all bro, actually it was a short notice trip and apart from that I was accompanied by family which spent some time in the Hayatabad market, while I and Ilyas dropped over to the "other" side and finished up a deal in an hour and a half, or so, to return back. And from that moment on, I guess, you would know the speed of my car back home! ;)\n\n Actually, I had all my papers and licenses with me, but the sect.144 had disturbed me a lot prior to my leave, whether it is imposed or not, and I wanted to get out of Peshawar timely, you know! Otherwise, had I been alone and not been around for the "other" stuff, and had had some time for gup-shup course a Peshawar trip would not be complete by any sense without seeing you too. Inshallah, next time, now that I''m "relieved" and my "thirst" for those 900 "others" is over for some time at least, next trip will be in a more relaxed state of mind, without family, Inshallah, and course I''ll let you know beforehand. So far, my pardons, please accept. :|\n\nYes, KK, prices were quoted from Jamrud Market. I purchased only Russians, all the way, no Chinese.\n\nAs regards the 9mm''s, rated at 1050, well, I think they will fire well, but our major concern with these so far from members seems to be of the excessive "smoke and dirt", which can be dealt with I think. At least they''d be good for the clones, instead of traditional desi stuff, I feel. Also cheap option for practice fire, where FTF/FTE''s, duds, etc, would not be of any major concern.', ''),

(85083, ' [b]AoA Everybody.[/b]\n\nI''ve been asked this question at least a gazillion time, not to mention the countless times I''ve accompanied a friend or a friend''s friend to an automotive/hardware supply store in a bid to answer the very same question:\n\n[b]"SPECIALTY PRODUCTS ASIDE, HOW CAN WE KEEP OUR FIREARMS IN TIP-TOP CONDITION USING COMMON/EASILY AVAILABLE PRODUCTS?" \n[/b]\n\nSo, after doing the very same and totally redundant exercise yesterday, I have decided to put it all down in writing so others may also benefit from it.\n\nInstead of going through each firearm part and suggesting an appropriate product, I''ll simply list the products down and their intended usage. This way reader can easily pick the desired product(s) from the list.\n\n[b]WD40:[/b]\n\n[img]http://akalol.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/wd40.jpg[/img]\n\nIt’s nothing more than penetrating oil with some lubricating and cleaning properties. It also serves as a good water displacing agent. Usage:\n\n1. To displace water from a wet firearm if you happen to drop it in mud/water during a hunt.\n\n2. To lubricate a firearm (emergency usage only), not a substitute to proper/dedicated lubricant.\n\n3. To clean a firearm (emergency usage only) in case you get it dirty by dropping it in dirt or something. It also cleans carbon/gunk pretty well but no way near a specialty cleaner.\n\n4. To remove stuck screws, specially stuck choke tubes. Infact if you don’t have any proper choke tube grease this can be used only as an emergency relief. Never ever install a dry choke tube as installing/removing it can damage threads.\n\nEven though WD40 is not designed to be used on firearms but I always advise to have it laying around just in case. Especially on hunts where you don’t want to carry a whole bag full of firearm cosmetics, a single aerosol can of WD40 renders itself quiet useful. However I would still advise that it cannot replace a specialty product that is designed to do a specific job. I would advise against using WD40 as rust preventive as it gums up over time.\n\n\n[b]Carnauba Automotive Wax:[/b]\n\n[img]http://www.kangaroo.co.kr/kang-english/prod-car/cosmic-b1.jpg[/img]\n\nCarnauba wax is derived from the leaves of a palm tree. It produces the glossy shine/finish that we’ve all seen after we wax our cars with a quality automotive wax. Fortunately, this wax also works wonders on firearms. Usage:\n\n1. Two-three coatings of a quality Carnauba wax on blued/Stainless Steel will give rich/deep gloss to your firearm. It’ll make an old firearm look like fresh out of factory brand new. Plus it will seal the metal underneath protecting it from corrosion. Apply with an appropriate applicator (usually a sponge) then buff to a beautiful shine.\n\n2. One-two coats of Carnauba wax on the wooden parts of your firearm will do wonders. Your shotgun/rifle stock will look practically brand new. It’ll preserve the wood underneath from moisture and small scratches. Apply with an appropriate applicator (usually a sponge) then buff to a beautiful shine.\n\n[b]CAUTION: for outer surfaces only. Not to be used on any moving parts. Not to be used inside the bore.\n[/b]\n\nI’ve only used Cosmic Wax and I’ve quiet satisfied with it. it does not contain any abrasive additives which can harm with multiple applications. There is one other quiet talked about at pakwheels.com called Mothers wax. I haven’t seen it so cannot comment. Just remember that any quality Carnauba wax will do as long as it doesn’t have any abrasive additives.\n\n[b]Leather and Tyre Wax:[/b]\n\n[img]http://www.kangaroo.co.kr/kang-english/prod-car/wax-b.jpg[/img]\n\nIf you own firearms that have polymer/plastic furniture then you’ll instantly become a believer after the very first application of a quality leather/tyre wax. Just a simple spray on and wipe off. It’ll make that faded black polymer furniture look that brand new black that u used to remember. It’ll also make those tiny/nasty scratches totally disappear. Usage:\n\n1. A simple spray on and wipe off procedure to bring back the youth of your firearm’s polymer furniture\n\n2. Don''t forget that dusty old/faded rubber butt pad. It also needs a spray to look brand new.\n\nThere are many brands out there but I’ve only used Cosmic Leather and Tyre wax. It works beautifully therefore never needed to try anything else.\n\n[b]C.V. Joint Grease:[/b]\n\n[img]http://www.rmeuropean.com/Images/products/large/3510_LIQ_23251C1F.jpg[/img]\n\nits the black colored grease. also called moly grease or molybdenum disulphide grease. it is designed to withstand extreme pressure and temperatures incurred in a constant velocity joint of front axle driven cars. also called GODA GREASE. perfect for use on choke tube threads. will keep them rust free and will prevent choke tube siezure (stuck choke tubes). you can use ordinary lithium grease but I prefer moly grease.\n\n[b]Carburetor Cleaner:[/b]\n\nperfect for cleaning out barrel bores (and choke tubes) after some serious shooting session. will clean all carbon/plastic fouling from barrel bores instantly. safe for bluing/parkerizing/chrome/nickel plating but other gun finished beware. it makes the cleaning job so much easier that I have practically stopped using any other kind of cleaner since. However I must insist caution while using. I only recommend cleaning barrels/bores/chambers of shotguns and handguns with it.\n\nI hope all this helps. These automotive products though may not be designed specifically for firearms but are very beneficial if one intends to maintain their firearms in top notch condition for years to come. Looking forward to questions/comments from esteemed members.\n\n\n[b]Regards.[/b]', ''),

(85095, ' Selam Pakgun brothers,\n\nI am a Turk, from ?stanbul and long time admirer of your local made Darra handguns...Unfortunatelly no \nchance to see them  here and the much of topics with photos of them by you, the  more enjoyment for\nme... Thanks...\n\nRelating to hammer/striker handguns, here are some sharing, I hope it would be usefull;\n\nHammer guns have their impact element located within the frame and acting mostly in rotational motion,\n\nStiker guns have their impact element located within the breecblock as acting in linear motion...\n\nBoth have power springs named "main spring" within locations they mounted and visionaly discriminating\nboth types for an avarage user is rather hard since some hammer guns have their impact element hidden\nwithin the frame or slide...\n\nNearly all revolvers are hammer guns with exception of some scarce ?talian counterparts and some of them\nhidden hammer type like Smith Wesson Centennial or old German Pickert...\n\nVast amount of pistols or autoloaders are indeed hammer guns with again some of being hidden class like\nFN five seven, Browning l903, Remington M51...\n\nStriker pistols had been made at beginning decades of   last century like Browning 1910, Mauser 1914,\nOrtgies, MAB model D, etc...  And had a new life with introducing of Glock, however, there were some flashes\nlike Heckler Koch P7 and VP70 before that date...Now all gone...\n\nBoth types have some advantages to each other as;\n\nHammer guns with leverage of their rotational motion appicable more powerfull punches to primers than linear\nacting strikers and if having outside spurs, they give the option of decocking and recocking fetures as well...\nAnd also, second strike capability is more obtainable with hammer guns since their parts named "sear" being\ncontained witihin same location with impact element and again, sear, holding the hammer in cocked position\nbeing mounted in the main gun component, frame, provides more security as compared to striker guns which\nimpact element and sear being mounted in seperate gun parts like frame and slide or breecholt.\n\nStriker guns carry fewer parts than hammer guns and if their spring compression points planned to stay within the\nbreechblock, they may be called nearly "battery off danger proof" since their impact element being cocked while\nbreechblock  closing in contrary to hammer guns and granting a privilege of the "far  breechblock from the\nbreech, the lesser chance of the ignition of primer with an unsupported cartridge" feature. Nearly all new striker\nguns remain in this category like Glock, Steyr M series, SW Sigma...However, some old striker pistols like Mauser\n1914, Browning 1905,1910 are out of this group. Striker guns , generally , provide more closer barrel axis to\nhand than hammer types,and Remington M51 is an exception for this rule which is a hidden halmmer gun.\n\nThere are second strike capable striker pistols in blowback operation like Le Francais and VP70, but only one recoil\noperated action type as being Walther P99.  In recoil operated kinds, the field stripping process needs complicate\nsear off line with striker and prevents practical lay outs for second strike action.\n\nPractical way to differ a striker gun from a hidden hammer gun is to look at back of breechblock. Generally striker\nguns carry a cover or plug at there for closing the striker channel  cut in the breechbolt.\n\nI would like to put photos and drawings into this mail but, unfortunatelly not familiar with this operation.\n\nBest regards.', ''),

(85134, ' [quote=Dr Hanif Malik]@steve simply say great shooting, for good shooting some tips please be delivered for us for handguns and .22 rifle.:)[/quote]\n\nDr. Malik, \n\nI would encourage you to read and practice what Skeeter60 wrote:\n\n[quote=Skeeter60]  \n[list=*]\n[*]Now when ever you are shooting a pistol on target; please ensure you do not have a small aiming point. This will create un necessary stress on you to align perfectly with the little dot. Have a dinner plate size aiming mark and you will be rewarded with small centered groups if you do other basics right.[/*]\n[*]All shooters have hands that move when aiming a pistol, let that movement continue it will gradually reduce with regular excercise and training on the range.[/*]\n[*]Align your sights perfectly and get a good squeeeeeze of the trigger irrespective of where your sights were at the time the shot broke.[/*]\n[*]Follow through and recover on target again.[/*]\n[*]You must learn breath control and stop breathing as you raise your hand for a deliberate single shot, if you do not fire within 7 seconds lower your hand and repeat after a in hailing and ex hailing a few times. \n\nFor Rapid fire the technique is different.[/*]\n[/list]\n[/quote]\n\nThe only point I don''t 100% agree with is his first point about not having a small aiming point.  But, I suspect we only differ on "how small is small."  And, we have to account for the distance from the shooter...\n\nI teach "aim small, miss small," and the story I offer as illustration is this.  I often visit the range and give out free 5-15 minute classes to persons who don''t shoot very well.  Frequently I ask them, "what are you trying to do?"  They will reply, "I''m just trying to hit the target."  (The target is almost 2 foot wide and 3 foot tall at 7 yards).  \n\nI say, "No offense, but it looks like all you are trying to do is hit the target.  But what happens if you aim for the target and miss by just 1 inch?"  \n\n"I miss the target?" they hesitantly offer.  \n\n"Correct," I respond, "but if you aim for the 10 ring and miss by even 6 inches?"  \nI can see that they get it and they reply, " I still hit the target!"  \n\n"Exactly," I explain, "you should aim small so that you miss small." Then I teach them to aim correctly and properly manipulate the trigger.\n\n[u][b]The trigger is almost everything.[/b][/u]\n\nSkeeter60 offered that a dinner plate sized target is correct.  He is asking you to aim smaller.  I would only ask you to aim smaller still.   However, a dinner plate sized target may be 100% correct at certain distances.\n\nI believe the true size of the aiming point is relative to the distance.  I "aim" for a portion of the target with is a circle large enough to cover most of my front sight at minimum.  I prefer aim aiming point that allows me to "see" the front sight, the rear sight, and the target.  At 25 yards this aiming point is much larger than at at 5 yards- it''s relative.\n\nConsider this image of sights on a target:\n\n[img]http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/7738/targetaiming.jpg[/img]\n\nOn the first two in the upper right the aiming point is too small.  The shooter can do what Skeeter60 wants them to avoid- concentrating on too small a target.  \n\nThe bottom left is probably the minimum.  I prefer something in like the upper left and lower left is still acceptable, though almost too large.\n\nWe can see how too large an aiming point causes problems as well:  \n\n[img]http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/158/targetaiming2.jpg[/img]\n\nYou can allign the sights, but you can''t possible determine if your round will impact at the same place on the target.\n\n\nSkeeter60s other points are right on target (please pardon the pun):\n\n*All shooters have hands that move when aiming a pistol, let that movement continue it will gradually reduce with regular excercise and training on the range.\n\n(don''t let the "wobble" in the sights bother you, it''s the trigger press which is more important.\n\n*Align your sights perfectly and get a good squeeeeeze of the trigger irrespective of where your sights were at the time the shot broke.  \n\n("squeeeeeeze" means slow and steady- never a sharp, quick press on the trigger)\n\n*Follow through and recover on target again.\n\n(don''t try to fight the recoil or suddenly let go of the trigger)\n\n*You must learn breath control and stop breathing as you raise your hand for a deliberate single shot, if you do not fire within 7 seconds lower your hand and repeat after a in hailing and exhale a few times.', ''),

(85180, ' Holsters\n\nI want to share a little bit of my experience.\nThe leather should be properly cured, I have seen guns ruined by chemicals seeping out of leather holsters. The gun should never be stored in a holster.\nThe holster must have a weapon retention strap which can be easily slipped off by the wearer and difficult for any one trying to snatch a gun.\nRight handed shooters should preferably wear the gun on the right as otherwise the gun is easily snatch able from the front ( hope the wearer is not facing away from the threat)\nThe practice of carrying an extra magazine on the holster or ammo on the holster makes the gun feel very heavy, extra magazine should be carried on the opposite side to reduce fatigue and balance the rig.\nOur weather is hot and even polyester holsters absorb sweat and ruin the finish, closed cell polymer or ballistic nylon holsters prevent this.\nThe holster should be stiff and contoured according to the gun shape to provide quick snag free drawing and less wear on the gun.\nIt should be secure and not dangle freely, walking or running with a dangling holster for some distance will keep on reminding you for days to get a better holster.    \nFor guns like the Glock and a host of others with similar firing mechanisim should  cover the trigger gaurd completely  and prevent holstering the gun with the trigger finger in advertently on the trigger.

His advise has been influential in many decisions of my life. \n\nI would certainly try to make it to the GTC end of this week. Thank you once again to every one.\nRgs\nPasha[/quote]\n\nSikandar Pasha Welcome on board. yes it is myself Col Jawed Umer, I am glad, an experienced handloader and shooter like you is also with us. Unfortunately Rohail Nana, and Major Sardar Aman Ullah Khan, who at one time was known as The Major in Pakistan Army are no more with us and probably stalking some game with handloads in kingdom come, if I know a bit about that hard as nails old soldier. \nThe Major sahab was responsible for the quest of modern knowledge on fire arms, and was the best instructor ever at  the School of Infantry and Tactics and one of the first Paratroopers in 1950, He was the captain of the Pakistan Army Shooting team in 1954. Happy hunting Major Saab , May Allah bless you.\nSikander we await valuable contributions from you and let us see the forum ablaze with discussions hotter than which clone is better ?', ''),

(85214, ' Salam All,\n@12 Gauge - ++1.\n\nLately, I have been using WD40 for most of my guns.  I first clean the guns METAL parts with a tooth brush dipped in Hoppes 9 solvent.  I then use WD40 to wash out the fouling.  For fiber/polymer material I sometimes use ArmorAll as this product has been in use with me since 1988.  \nI would idealy use Birchwood Casey Gun Scrubber Synthetic Safe however, they are still on back order.  Using this I don''t even take the weapon apart, I just lock the slide back and spray.  I have also used 3M Disk Brake Cleaner (don''t use this on polymer/fiber), and have found good results for cleaning; however, this too is no longer available at Metro in Isb.  Grease is a great idea providing it is used in very very small quantity and used only on the moving/contact parts; there is dry grease/lube also available in the market in the auto dept.  I would suggest using that as it too is the same expense as the Constant Viscosity Joint Grease.\n\nI agree with 12Gauge that WD40 is best.  Good topic bro.', ''),

It really caused great uproar there, imagine Mall road being blocked for 10 minutes, yet the only confidence that made me do this was that it was a "petty issue", I was being troubled for, and that the SSP in those days over there was a family guy. I HAD NO DRIVING LICENSE, even only PHOTOCOPIES of my registration docs, so course I had to do [i]something[/i] at least!\n\nFurthermore, I''ve noticed, that Islamabad registered vehicles are much often stopped for minor traffic issues.

(85324, ' [quote=shahzad awan]Gilani, can we fire POF 9mm 2Z ammo from CF 98,  isn''t POF 2Z ammo  for mp5[/quote]\nCF98 is designed to fire DAP ammo and therefore, IMO there should be no problems in firing high pressure rounds. POF2Z is otherwise a moderately high pressure round, as per the chronographic test conducted by Skeeter60 sahib, one of our top experts. I have fired more than 1200 rounds of 2Z with my CF 98 and there have been no problems or visible wear and tear to gun except few occasional failures to feed (average 1 out of 100 rounds). I have fired 2z with other chinese pistols like HP77B and NP22 also and found no problems at all. \n\nThe forum opinion on this issue is however mixed. Experts like Skeeter60 Sahib mention firing of 2Z with pistols like Sig P226, CZ75 etc for over a decade with no problems. Few other members advise against firing of high pressure rounds from normal guns which, IMHO, is theoretically correct. And its quite true for ammo sensitive pistols like Taurus models (less PT92 / 99), S&W M&P9, S&W Sigma etc. [b]This simply means that POF 2Z cant be blindly fired with every 9mm.

(85339, ' @Steven Cline, \nThank you very much for clarifying the subject of the size of the aiming point. I should have mentioned that techniques may vary for Match or bullseye shooting and combat or SD shooting. \nI shoot matches like the Centre Fire in which the target aiming area ( Black circle  is large like a dinner plate) although the 10 ring  is only 2 inches in diameter. The same Target is used for the Standard Pistol Event and again for the 50 meter Free Pistol event. The second half of the Center Fire Match has a dueling target with a 4 inch diameter 10 ring but the black aiming area for the Target at 25 meters is more than 2 feet in diameter.\nThe same target is used for Olympic Rapid fire Match where we shoot at five targets in 4 seconds at 25 meters. The Technique is to focus the eye on the front sight where as the black aiming mark becomes  blurred;  we go for a smooth squeeze in the middle of this  blurred mass ; if the trigger control is good we are rewarded by tens.\n\nThe speed shooting or IPSC the targets are much closer than 25 meters and the max scoring rings are much bigger than the 2 inch 10 rings at 25 meters, here speed is important. Again in Practical Pistol matches the targets do not have any aiming marks and the shooter has to go for center of Mass shooting. \nI had recommended that for a beginner a bigger aiming mark will help him concentrate on learning the basics of breath control and trigger control.\nI hope I have been able to express what I wanted to say. I will send pictures of the targets and also the photographs of sight pictures. \nOnce again Steve I appreciate your help in clarifying what I missed.', ''),

Fired 2 mags (30 rounds) in 16 secs (this includes the time for changing the magazine). You can see the bullets going all over the place, some of them even going out of the target. [b]How to be more consistent and accurate in rapid fire?[/b][/quote]\n\nNothing changes when you shoot faster, you do the same thing, only faster, but you must still do the same things: A sight picture and pause in breathing, smooth manipulation of the trigger.  \n\nQuoting Mike Dalton, Steel Challenge Match Director:\n\n"It is important to remember that speed is a byproduct of doing things correctly.  It is something that will automatically improve with practice.  The shooter must constantly work on good fundamentals and not try to be fast... Shooting fast and accurately is really about smoothness of operation and adherence to proper sight picture, hold, trigger control and follow-through.  If you put these pieces of the puzzle together smoothly, your times will improve and you just might someday be a Master shooter."  January/February 2010 Frontsight magazine, page 5.\n\nMost shooters begin to jerk on the trigger when they shoot faster.  You don''t jerk, you press a little faster.  Once you feel the difference having pressed fast instead of jerking on the trigger you''ll understand.\n\nTo learn this, don''t accelerate from 10 mph to 100 mph.  Shoot a mag at slow, another mag a bit faster, a third a bit faster still, and so on.  Pay close attention to your trigger pull.  During one mag your group will suddenly get worse- that''s where you started jerking on the trigger.  If you were paying attention you probably felt the trigger pull change from a press to sudden movements.\n\nYou still must see your sights.  At 15 yards this is very true.  You can not "out-shoot" your sights.  Make sure you see your sights on each shot.\n\nDon''t try to stop the recoil:\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lsO1_cqjok[/url]\n\nStiffen your wrists, but let the gun shoot.\n\nSome shooters report that gripping the gun more firmly helps with rapid shooting.  \n\n[quote]\nWe were taught many years back to [b]focus on front site tip [/b]while firing. Somehow, I have developed the habit of [b]focusing on target while keeping the sites aligned[/b]. Which is better? \n[/quote]\n\nAlways better to focus on the front sight.  It should look like this (but with a blurry target behind it):\n[img]http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/7347/sightpicture.jpg[/img]\n\n[quote]Secondly, [b]any exercise / tips to improve trigger control[/b]?    \n[/quote]\n\nYes, dry-fire:\n\n[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mEoYHdpuLY[/url]\n\nPay close attention to the first part when I discuss the core of dry firing- slow steady trigger press and reset.  Use only the distal pad of the trigger finger.\n\nEnjoy!', ''),

Learned one thing though, for my aging eyes & shaking hands bullseye with 4" dimeter is perfect as with 1" one you can see what mess I have made :)\nTaurus 37mag was treat to shoot and results are quite encouraging, all 8 on the paper ;)[/quote]\n\nDenovo- I spent some time looking at your targets.  Where the bullet impacts tells us a lot about what the shooter did while shooting.  I presume you are a right handed shooter.  \nThe tendancy to shoot low is usually a pre-ignition push.  You are fighting recoil which hasn''t happen yet. \n\nLow and left is a jerk on the trigger which you exhibited during a the shots with the revolver fired double-action.  That makes sense with the longer and heavier trigger pull.  \n\nThe shots low and right are often the result of tightening your grip while shooting.\n\nI can''t quite tell what your true pattern might be.  If I imagine all of your shots on a single target you have them strung out like arc under the target about 2 left, 4 center, 2 right.  So I don''t quite know.  \n\nIt''s better to see a few more shots with the same gun and ammo.  It makes the pattern stand out.\n\nMy best advise is to maintain a firm and unchanging grip, press slowly on the trigger through the shot watching the front sight the entire time.  Watch for a anticipation.  If you have a friend load a dude round into the gun you may see the front sight dip suddenly on the dude proving a push in anticipation of the shot.  I''d likely need to see you shoot in person to determine more specifically what you are doing.', ''),

It matters in identifying the errors.[/quote]\nNow regarding your observation given above. I must say a very very keen observation. I checked up in detail and compared the timings given on the pics and realised that these were two different pics of the same target, taken from two different angles. Since we (myself and my two sons) fired around 250 rounds (including around 100 air rifle pallets) and did not write anything on the targets so it was difficult to differentiate between so many pics at the end of the day. [b]I think the lesson learnt is that always write details on the target before taking the pics so that it stays as a record.

[b]I presume you are a right handed shooter.[/b]  \n[b]The tendancy to shoot low is usually a pre-ignition push.  You are fighting recoil which hasn''t happen yet. \n[/b]\nLow and left is a jerk on the trigger which you exhibited during a the shots with the revolver fired double-action.  That makes sense with the longer and heavier trigger pull.  \n\nThe shots low and right are often the result of tightening your grip while shooting.\n\nI can''t quite tell what your true pattern might be.  If I imagine all of your shots on a single target you have them strung out like arc under the target about 2 left, 4 center, 2 right.  So I don''t quite know.  \n\nIt''s better to see a few more shots with the same gun and ammo.  It makes the patter stand out.\n\nMy best advise is to maintain a firm and unchanging grip, press slowly on the trigger through the shot watching the front sight the entire time.  Watch for a anticipation.  If you have a friend load a dude round into the gun you may see the front sight dip suddenly on the dude proving a push in anticipation of the shot.  I''d likely need to see you shoot in person to determine more specifically what you are doing.[/quote]\n\nThanks Steve, you are absolutely right, I am right handed and let me admit that pre-ignition push is there, I cannot control myself pushing the handgun forward anticipating the recoil.

I suspect the shooter can feel himself dip as well.  That felt tip disappears in the guns recoil so they can feel what they need to do to stop.\n\n[b]Dry fire helps a lot.[/b]  It trains your brain on what is right because the anticipatory push most often manifests when anticipating recoil.  When you know you are no going to have recoil you don''t subconciously push against it.  It trains you to just sight and press.\n\n[u][b]Slow down.[/b][/u]  This may be all you need.  Being disciplined to hold steady through the shot.  Few people seem to be able to so in classes.\n\nI use a combination of the three.  Tell them first, slow down, that may stop the pre0ignition push or flinch but usually the push returns.  Then I use a snap-cap to show them the flinch and have them dry fire.  It usually goes away after that.\n\n\nOh!  Also, ya gotta shoot a lot.  :D', ''),

Birdshot penetrated through two pieces of drywall (representing one wall) and was stopped in the paper on the front of the second wall. The problem with birdshot is that it does not penetrate enough to be effective as a defense round. Birdshot is designed to bring down little birds.\n\nA policeman told of seeing a guy shot at close range with a load of 12 gauge birdshot, and was not even knocked down. He was still walking around when the EMTs got there. It was an ugly, shallow wound, but did not STOP the guy. And that is what we want... to STOP the bad guy from whatever he is doing. To do this, you must have a load that will reach the vitals of the bad guy. Birdshot will not do this.\n\nIn fact, tests have shown that even #4 Buckshot lacks the necessary penetration to reach the vital organs. Only 0 Buck, 00 Buck, and 000 Buck penetrate enough to reach the vital organs.\nUnless you expect to be attacked by little birds, do not use birdshot. Use 00 Buck. It will do the job.[/quote]', ''),

Maybe a failure to hold your breath as the group is a bit elongated ( up and down ).  Breathing during the shooting process can cause this time of group.\n\nThe grouping left maybe incorrect placement of the trigger finger on the trigger (use center of your distal pad).  It may be the sights are off.  It may be ammo.\n\nSkeeter60 has more experience shooting bullseye than I do.  I don''t always see errors the one-handed shooters spot.[/quote]\n\nThe Norinco pistol and military hard ball ammo is a combination not conducive to producing tight groups in the first place. When I keep these two factors in mind I find more fault with this combo for target shooting. This result is fairly good for SD how ever. \n By bulls Eye Shooting standards the target/group is full of holes ( pun intended).\n As Steve pointed out, the shooter did not hold his breath on all shots, the concentration was poor, and of course as pointed out earlier by Steve the trigger finger was not placed properly on the trigger; I think the trigger finger was contacting the trigger more towards the second joint rather than the distal pad which results in pulling shots to the left/ right.\nBulls eye or precision Pistol Shooting needs utmost concentration to achieve good scores. \nI would recommend beginning shooters to learn to shoot with .22 Pistols like the Ruger, the Browning buck mark or the Match pistols which are available here at almost the same price as a Ruger, where as the match Pistols cost about four times the Ruger in the US or Europe.   \nAn air pistol of Match grade would help a lot. In Lahore Steyr LP 10 are available and would help any aspiring shooter.\nA Norinco military 9mm pistol with military ammo cannot shoot better than 6 inch groups at 25m where as a Match grade 9mm or 45 with proper ammo will group within one inch at 25 m.\nI think I have encouraged the shooting ability of the shooter but tried to explain that a combat 9mm Pistol of any make will group in not less than 4 inches consistently with military ammo[/quote]\n\nSkeeter60 Sir, thanks a lot for your time. Your critique is extremely objective and would surely be a great help. I have noted down the faults and would concentrate on them during next session.  And I fully agree that precision pistol shooting is all together a different ball game. It requires proper and focused training (not just firing practice which I have done a lot) and an appropriate match grade weapon. \n\n Thanks a lot again, Sir. \nregards', ''),

(85893, ' [b]Two Choices[/b] \n \nWhat would you do?....you make the choice. Don''t look for a punch line,\nthere isn''t one. Read it anyway. My question is:\nWould you have made the same choice? \n \nAt a fundraising dinner for a school that serves children with learning\ndisabilities, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that\nwould never be forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school\nand its dedicated staff, he offered a question: \n \n''When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does,\nis done with perfection. \n \nYet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do.\nHe cannot understand things as other children do. \n \nWhere is the natural order of things in my son?'' \n \nThe audience was stilled by the query. \n \nThe father continued. ''I believe that when a child like Shay , who was\nmentally and physically disabled comes into the world, an opportunity to\nrealize true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other\npeople treat that child.'' \n \nThen he told the following story: \n \nShay and I had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing\nbaseball. Shay asked, ''Do you think they''ll let me play?'' I knew that\nmost of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but as\na father I also understood that if my son were allowed to play, it would\ngive him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be\naccepted by others in spite of his handicaps. \n \nI approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting much)\nif Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, ''We''re\nlosing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can\nbe on our team and we''ll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.'' \n \nShay struggled over to the team''s bench and, with a broad smile, put on\na team shirt. I watched with a small tear in my eye and warmth in my\nheart. The boys saw my joy at my son being accepted. \n \nIn the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay''s team scored a few runs but\nwas still behind by three. \n \nIn the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the\nright field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic\njust to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as I\nwaved to him from the stands. \n \nIn the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay''s team scored again.\n \nNow, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was\non base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat. \n \nAt this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win\nthe game? \n \nSurprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all\nbut impossible because Shay didn''t even know how to hold the bat\nproperly, much less connect with the ball. \n \nHowever, as Shay stepped up to the \n \nplate, the pitcher, recognizing that the other team was putting winning\naside for this moment in Shay''s life, moved in a few steps to lob the\nball in softly so Shay could at least make contact. \n \nThe first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. \n \nThe pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly\ntowards Shay. \n \nAs the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball\nright back to the pitcher. \n \nThe game would now be over. \n \nThe pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the\nball to the first baseman. \n \nShay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game. \n \nInstead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman''s head,\nout of reach of all team mates. \n \nEveryone from the stands and both teams started yelling, ''Shay, run to\nfirst! \n \nRun to first!'' \n\nNever in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first\nbase. \n \nHe scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled. \n \nEveryone yelled, ''Run to second, run to second!'' \n\nCatching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and\nstruggling to make it to the base. \n \nBy the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the\nball . the smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be\nthe hero for his team. \n \nHe could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he\nunderstood the pitcher''s intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the\nball high and far over the third-baseman''s head. \n \nShay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him\ncircled the bases toward home. \n \nAll were screaming, ''Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay'' \n \nShay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him\nby turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, ''Run to\nthird! \n \nShay, run to third!'' \n\nAs Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators,\nwere on their feet screaming, ''Shay, run home!\nRun home!'' \n \nShay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who\nhit the grand slam and won the game for his team \n \n''That day'', said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face,\n''the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity\ninto this world''. \n \nShay didn''t make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never\nforgotten being the hero and making me so happy , and coming home and\nseeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day! \n \nAND NOW A LITTLE FOOT NOTE TO THIS STORY: \n \nWe all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second\nthought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices,\npeople hesitate. \n \nThe crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but\npublic discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools\nand workplaces. \n \nIf you''re thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that\nyou''re probably sorting out the people in your address book who aren''t\nthe ''appropriate'' ones to receive this type of message Well, the person\nwho sent you this believes that we all can make a difference. \n \nWe all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize\nthe ''natural order of things.'' \n \nSo many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us\nwith a choice: \n \nDo we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up\nthose opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the\nprocess? \n \nA wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats it''s least\nfortunate amongst them.', ''),

For collectors, its nice to have weapons of different types and brands but for those who are just keeping one or two handguns mainly for SD/HD, reliability overtakes every other consideration. IMHO, our primary HD/SD weapon should never be ammo sensitive. Moreover, one must have full confidence in the reliability of his SD weapon. Both Viking and Scorpion are very reliable weapons and consume all types of ammo without a problem.

(85982, ' Pistol Shooting\n\nThere is a proper protocol and different events for which one should train and practice. Randomly shooting without any discipline renders no training benefits. It is a waste of time and expansive ammunition.\n\nI will start with the Discipline of Precision also known as Bulls eye shooting.\nThis is the mother of all kinds of shooting; Rapid or timed,  unless one learns this discipline properly there can be no progress.\nIf one is going to use the standard 9mm pistol with the 9mm ammo available then I think one may not go beyond ten or 15 yds/ms.\nThe standard targets which are available may be used, colourful rings have no advantage as a matter of fact these may be avoided.  A table should be set up in front of the shooter where he should place his gun and ammo and spotting scope if one is going to use it. The table not only assists in safe handling of the pistol but is very convenient for resting the pistol during shots, ( I am going over the basics for the advantage of beginers, please ) a chair should be placed for resting in between series.\nOnly five shots should be loaded and a series of five shots should be fired in  five or six minutes. Raise your hand and adjust your stance, you should be aligning the body in a way that if a line is drawn through both of your shoulders it should be forming an angle of between 15 degrees to 30 degrees depending on your physique and where you find yourself most comfortable, your  feet should be slightly more or equal to your shoulder width and you must place equal weight on both feet. I will post picture one of these days also.\nNow for a right handed shooter grip the pistol in the left hand and firmly plant it in your right hand which should be wide open to accept the grip in line with your fore arm. \nGrip the gun firmly but not in a death grip, curl you index finger and place it on the trigger in a way that the distal pad of the first joint is in contact with the trigger and the index finger is not touching the frame or trigger guard or the grip and is free to squeeze the trigger without any un necessary  friction or distraction.\nTake few deep breaths, in hale deeply and exhale a bit and hold your breath, you should immediately raise your hand and aim and then close both eyes for a while and then open your eyes to see if the pistol is pointed in the direction of the target, if your hand has moved away from the target on closing and the reopening eyes; adjust your stance and retry. Once you are comfortable and your hand stays on target after closing eyes ; this is  your natural stance, your neck should be relaxed and body not twisted in any direction. Now you are ready to shoot. \nRelax and go over in your mind that you will focus on the front sight and squeeze the trigger in one smooth flow irrespective of where your sights are in the blurred mass of the aiming point. You should not will the trigger it should be a SURPRISE BREAK the most important part of any shooting any weapon accurately. This becomes doubly important when shooting a pistol. \nOnce the shot is fired have good a follow through by staying on Target and re aiming the gun and then slowly lower your hand to rest the barrel on the table. Ask yourself , was your focus on the front sight ?\nWas the shot a SURPRISE BREAK ? if the answer to any one of these questions is negative the shot is a bad shot.\nAlso ask your self did you lose the front sight when the shot was fired, did you see the case being ejected and smoke coming out the barrel ? If not, then your concentration is not complete.\nPerhaps it is getting monotonous specially without pictures so more later', ''),

Following the law of the probable leads me to walk without fear of something so remote.\n\nThe law of probability says that I will never find myself attempting to shoot my gun with only my thumb and trigger finger apparently from around a corner while not sighting it.  Instead I carry a great and dependable firearm- because the chances I am required to shoot my gun with my thumb and trigger finger apparently from around a corner while not sighting it are as a likely as being struck by frozen human waste falling from a plane passing overhead.\n\nThe law of logic says that if I do have to shoot my gun with my thumb and trigger finger apparently from around a corner while not sighting it...  It won''t matter if I am trying to do so with a Glock, a Sig, a Beretta, or any of other handgun.\n\nSorry, that''s just how I see it.  While 9mm Luger is 100% correct, I find it 100% irrelevent that the Glock will not fire under these circumstances.', ''),

Birdshot penetrated through two pieces of drywall (representing one wall) and was stopped in the paper on the front of the second wall. The problem with birdshot is that it does not penetrate enough to be effective as a defense round. Birdshot is designed to bring down little birds.\n\nA policeman told of seeing a guy shot at close range with a load of 12 gauge birdshot, and was not even knocked down. He was still walking around when the EMTs got there. It was an ugly, shallow wound, but did not STOP the guy. And that is what we want... to STOP the bad guy from whatever he is doing. To do this, you must have a load that will reach the vitals of the bad guy. Birdshot will not do this.\n\nIn fact, tests have shown that even #4 Buckshot lacks the necessary penetration to reach the vital organs. Only 0 Buck, 00 Buck, and 000 Buck penetrate enough to reach the vital organs.\nUnless you expect to be attacked by little birds, do not use birdshot. Use 00 Buck. It will do the job.[/quote][/quote]\n\nI agree 100%. and birdshots are for shooting birds, not Alto''s. :)', ''),

(86172, ' [quote=Silent killerr][quote=Denovo87][quote=StevenCline]:lol:\n\n\n"[b]same weapon painted black or camo, in some cases with lots of do-dads and thing-a-magiggies hanging off of it.[/b]"[/quote]\n\n\nThats exactly what tactical gun gear means to me :lol:  thanks Steve bro ;)[/quote]\n\n\nplz explain it in some detail[/quote]\n\nPlease understand this is simply me opining and carries no weight in reality.\n\nTactical, as I quoted it above, describes the plan- is it short term.  When I plan to assault and objective, I engage in tactics.  I have a short-term plan. This is tactical thinking.\n\nWhen I plan to use a 5.56mm cartridge because it wounds more often than kills, requiring the host nation to invest more resources in carrying for it''s wounded thereby stress it''s nations willingness to fight my nation I have engaged in long term planning.  This is also called strategic thinking.\n\nWeapons could be catergorized as either tactical or strategic.  A rifle or hangun, a tank or artillery piece, mortar, anti-tank missile, and so forth one might suppose to be tactical- used primarily for the short term thinking and application.  A soldier uses his rifle to clear the building or shoot the enemy on the battle field, the tank to shoot the other tank, the mortar to hit the command and control center, the anti-tank missile to destry the tank or armored vehicle.\n\nOne might suppose that larger investiment weapons are more strategic in their use.  Nuclear weapons are more strategic, bombers, large naval vessels.  \n\nA specific type of missile or bomb might be more tactical.  Short-term and specific.  The aircraft carrier is more long term.\n\nThe tactical is there here and now.  The strategic is far-sighted.\n\nBut somehow the use of tactical has been used to mean more special forces, ninja, or operator.  More James Bond, less Presidential.  \n\nHere in the U.S. the bastardization of the term has been lead by salesmen.  Take the bolt action rifle.  If it has a nice highly polished wooden stock with crome barrel is it a hunting rifle.  But, put a black synthetic stock on it, with a blued barrel and it''s now a "tactical" rifle.  No matter that the rifle functions exactly the same, nor is it more accurate or have great capacity.\n\nThe same with a 1911.  If it comes with a regular dust cover it''s a 1911.  Put a rail on it, and suddenly it''s a tactical response pistol... even more so if it''s black in color.  This pattern is repeated so much that the color black has become synonymous with tactical.\n\nOne might correctly argue that the less shinny pistol or rifle is more easily hidden night (or day) which could aid in the short term.  However, it really is a strategic thinking decision.  Loosing fewer soldiers because shiny barrels not giving them away means I am more likely to win a war as opposed to simply loosing a single engagement.  If it takes 100 men to assault a hill and the black rifle means I only loose 10 men in the process versus 20 with the shiny rifle, then I could take more hills with the same 1000 men using the black rifle instead of the shiny rifle.\n\nTake a pair of pants.  If they are sturdy, with cargo pockets, and tan then they are cargo pants.  Dye them black and they are "tactical pants."\n\nIn some cases, being black in color (or painted in camoflage) wasn''t tactical enough.  The standard black AR-15 with a detachable magazine was just an AR-15 Assault Rifle.  But, if it has a picatinny rail, pistol fore-grim, ACOG, blah, blah, blah, it''s now a "Tactical Assault Rifle."\n\nI was mocking the over-use or miss-use of the word tactical as a sales ploy.  So much is the word appplied to sell a product that the word is almost meaningless.  A vest in desert tan with a bunch of pockets for all your sunglasses, cell phones, walkie-talkies, rifle magazines is an assault vest.  If it''s black then it''s a tactical assault vest for your tactical sunglasses, tactical cell phone, tactical comms unit, tactical assault rifle magazines, etc.  Regardless that in the desert the tan vest is more "tactical" than the black vest (even at night).\n\nSometimes a product is labelled as tactical just to market to a particular customer group, even if the exact same item is not called tactical when sold to a different customer group.  This is done so much that some people openly mock the use of tacitcal to sell to "wanna-bes" as "tacti-cool"', ''),

(86312, 'Operating Systems for Autoloader Shotguns Selam brothers,\n\nWhat about remembering our knowledges about the matter...\n\nExisting operating systems for automatic feeding are three; recoil, gas and inertia...\n\nRecoil operation began with famous Browning A5 at beginning of last century and remained\nvalid until to mid of that age without a rival...Being all in "Long Recoil" category in which, barrel\nand breechblock recoiling backwards as locked to a distance longer than the shell they use.\n\nThere were only two "Short Recoil" production guns after that time all belonging "Browning", as\nfirst, Double Automatic, and after a few decades, Browning A500... In which barrels recoiling\nbackwards as being locked with breechbolt for a short distance to unlock them... These guns\ncould be considered as "Inertia Operated" as well since they used "Inertia Blocks" to separate\nthe recoiling members... Both without a big market success. But Double Automatic being one of\nthe most successfull  "Self Adjusting for various shell weight" shotgun however...\n\nOne can meet one of these guns in recent days and differing them visualy is possible if they carry\na ventilating rib over the barrel since these strips do not extend to the contact with receiver, but\nstop at least one inch before in short recoil, and a few added inches on long recoil guns...There is\nno other external identifying factor for them but much can be found if forearm taken out.\n\nRecoil guns need a firm shoulder to work in due course since the barrel and bolt recoils togetherly\nwithin the receiver and a loose hold causes an interrupted backward motion resulting malfunctions.\nHip shooting with this kind of a gun, would possibly give a reloading issue. \n\nGas operated guns use expanding gases of fired shell to unlock the breechbolt from the barrel and\ngases in operation ?s outletted via port or ports in a closed chamber to work with a connected tackle \nto carry out the purpose and since  opening the bolt occurs after the shell contains to leave the barrel,\nthis outletted gas can be considered as "waste" or no effect to the power of shell.\n\nThere were gas operated rifled guns at beginning the last century, but production of this kind in shotguns\nbegan after the second half of that age as beyondside the development of plastics in ?ndustry.  Relation\nis from the cause of using plastic containers for shots preventing their possible pluggins into outletting\nholes if used barely.\n\nFirst successfull shotgun in gas operation belonged to "Sears" and  same gun was used in guns carrying\n"Higgins" and High Standart" brands for years. In contrary of common belief, Remington was the second\nin this field and its guns having lack of some practical features like recoil springs over the magazine not\ninfringing the patent rights of the first.\n\nAll gas operated shotguns remain in "Short Stroke" category in which gas piston travels in a short \ndistance within the gas cylinder...This operation system needs additional devices to automatically adjust\nthe breechbolt opening speed in various weighted shots and  these adjusters came to life in at last\ndecades of last century mainly as being forward exhausting of Beretta, backward of Browning and sideward\nof Remington...Best for "Browning" and worst for "Remington" in actual life.\n\nIn both practical and tactical purposes, gas autoloaders are prooved "Best" in selfloading category and \nvisualy differing these arms is again possible if they carry top ribs since they extend in contact with receiver.\n\nLast member of club is inertia operation and "Benelli" was not the sole introducer of this kind.  Lochhead,\nan inventor of Olin Company granted a patent in 1949(filed in 1946) descibing all features of this kind but\nappearently no production at all.\n\nIn contrary to recoil operated guns, inertia operation  works with comlete firearm recoiling agaist to a floating\nbolt carrier within the receiver and needs not a firm shoulder  to carry out operating, in theory, hip shooting\nis nearly the best position for this kind, because the gun freely recoils agaist to the inertia weight to \ncompress the provided bouncer spring mounted between the breechbolt and expelling rearwards to unlock\nto eject, to cock and to reload tasks with aid of recoil spring.\n\nSole manufacturer of inertia guns are Beretta company and its connections like Benelli, Franchi, Breda, Stoeger.\nHowever, Patent rights of Benelli is now expired and it is hoped more and more brands will enter in this field\nwith quality productions in foregoing years. New Benelli Vinci can be considered as a response for future rivals.\n\nVisuel difference of inertia guns is the gap between bolt and carrier at its back looking through the ejection\nport, however, some cost saving applications among the connected brands may cause using same parts \nlooking same vision as causing misunderstanding.\n\nIn hunting and sportive activities, inertia operation can be considered "Best", but in tactical use, some added\naccecories can be mounted onto the gun, and they change the weight to be recoiled agaist to the floating bolt\ncarrier in a slowed speed and cause malfunctions. This is the cause of U.S. Army requesting a gas operated\nshotgun from Benelli.\n\nBest regards.', ''),

You know it could fool around the LEA''s pretty much! :lol: Especially if you could have a butt cuff placed with a few "fake" rounds placed on the outer, for display!\n\nActually, bear in mind one major assertion: It''s "gas operated" piston movement cycling, hence in my view there should be less chances of mechanism failures like with typical spring operated repeaters.\n\nSecond, it''s actually something on the lines of Benelli and Franchi  types, which are priced I believe above 200K.\n\nOverall, on better afterthought, I feel price is mainly a "novelty" price. It should settle down to something like 70K, making it a reasonable price at [b]1/3 [/b]of the prices of it''s European counterparts. Thus, you''re right, better take a "wait and see" stance for now. \n\nI could post a separate thread here for what I''m actually looking around for, if it''s available in the 70-80K range or so:\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pq9O3JA][img]http://s3.postimage.org/9O3JA.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nIf any idea of availability/price of this particular one by Fabarm Sdass, let me kindly know.

A lawyer friend did not go partridge shooting this season because he had a repeater. He had put up a case for reversal of this ban, and claims to have succeeded in an appeal court in Lahore. According to him, the court has agreed to lift the ban with the condition that not more than two rounds will be loaded in the repeater. The wildlife officials will check this aspect also while in the field.\nJust having one shooting day left in this season, it may not be possible to implement this decision immediately, but for the future, those having repeaters can be hopeful.

A code that defines the true standards, conduct and moral judgement of a sportsman. Their actions during a hunt are the mirror image of the rest of their personal lives. Not hunting more than one can use, leaving the younger ones alive, etc. There is a lot to consider before you pull the trigger, including the safety first.\nOne of our member Viking''s father has been a big hunter, with some good trophies in his account; he is ill now a days. He used to first fly the bird if found on the ground and then he tried to shoot it. He left the ones found with very young birds. Once a bird (i forgot the name) was seen sitting on a tree that he didn''t shoot because that bird was wet and according to him had some water in her mouth for her child. This is Ethics guys.', ''),

(86597, ' There are two types of compressed air airguns, other than the CO2 powered ones. The first kind is the one where the shooter has to use the lever on the gun to pump it before every shot. An example would be the Daisy Powerline 880 and the Crosman 1377. The other kind of compressed air gun is the PCP (Pre-Compressed Pneumatic). In this, air is pumped beforehand through means of a hand pump. The gun has a built-in tank, which is able to use the pumped air for a number of shots. \n\nThe latter category is usually more expensive than the former, and even some of the mid- to high-power spring guns. In my opinion, the PCP''s advantage lies in fast follow-up shots, and the fact that vibrations in the gun do not affect accuracy and scope zero, as in the case of spring guns. The lever-pump guns are virtually recoil-less (only thing which moves, apart from the pellet and air, is the triggering spring), at least in my case.\n\nHaven''t seen a PCP around here. Used to have a Powerline 880 (my dad''s, bought in 1990), but it no longer works properly and just sits on the top of my closet.\n\nAny further info on availability of PCPs or CO2 guns will be greatly appreciated, though I believe CO2 refills will be extremely hard to come by, even if someone is able to get the gun.... :)', ''),

Take a look at this....\n\nJudge frees millionaire jailed for attacking knife-wielding burglar saying he was ''a peaceful man who feared for his family''By Vanessa Allen and Andy Dolan\nLast updated at 7:51 AM on 21st January 2010\n\nComments (582) Videos Add to My Stories \n Free man: Munir Hussain arriving home in High Wycombe after his release\nBritain''s top judge sent out a powerful message yesterday that a householder has a right to defend his family. \n\nThe Lord Chief Justice freed a father jailed for attacking an armed burglar, saying the case demanded mercy in the face of a national outcry. \n\nMillionaire businessman Munir Hussain went home from prison after Lord Judge ruled at the Appeal Court that he had lashed out because the robber''s gang had threatened to kill his wife and children. \n\nHis two-and-a-half-year term was changed to a suspended sentence while his brother Tokeer, who was also involved in the incident, had his 39-month sentence reduced to two years meaning he could be released within months. \n\nLord Judge said his decision came because of the exceptional nature of the case and the public outrage it has provoked. \n\n''There are some situations which guidelines cannot and do not cover. This is one of them and today the sentence of the court must address and balance the ancient principles of justice and mercy. In this case the call for a merciful sentence is intense.'' \n\nLord Judge insisted that his ruling did not represent a green light for homeowners to mete out vigilante justice against burglars. \n\nBut his judgment will be seen as bolstering the right of householders to protect their home and family against attack. \n\nMr Hussain, 53, was jailed last month for attacking a knife-wielding burglar who held his family hostage in their own home and threatened to slit their throats. \n\nHis case provoked nationwide fury when he and his brother were jailed for injuring career criminal Walid Salem, while the convicted burglar was allowed to walk free. \n\nFollowing the Appeal Court decision, his son Awais, 22, and his brother Qadeer collected him from HMP Bullingdon, a Category C prison in Oxfordshire, and he returned home to High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, for an emotional reunion with his wife and family. \nLooking shaken and drained, Mr Hussain hugged relatives and thanked the nation for the support he and his brother had received. \n Relief: Mr Hussain is greeted by his son Awais as he leaves Bullingdon Prison in Oxfordshire earlier\nHe said: ''First of all thank you to the country for supporting us while we were away. I am very happy but obviously my brother is still there.''\nThe court heard that his ordeal had left Mr Hussain, who runs a soundproofing company, is a race relations campaigner and chairman of the Asian Business Council, suffering from flashbacks, panic attacks and post-traumatic stress.\n\n More...We''ll protect have-a-go heroes: Tories promise good citizens who take on thugs won''t be arrested \nANALYSIS: The sympathy is there, now change the law \nDAILY MAIL COMMENT: Common sense and true British justice \n\nAwais said: ''We have been through hell. Your life doesn''t go back to normal - you can''t even imagine what your life used to be like. I don''t think my family will ever fully recover, although it is a big relief that we will now have my Dad back. We respect the law and always will. But in this case we didn''t feel it had done us justice.''\n\n Warm embrace: Mr Hussain gives his son Awais a hug \nThe case has reignited public debate over the rights of householders to protect themselves from attack. \n\nThe Home Secretary has pledged to review the law and the Conservatives have made a manifesto commitment that ''have-a-go heroes'' should be protected from prosecution. \n\nBritain''s top policeman yesterday said home owners who injured others while defending themselves, their families or their homes should not be prosecuted. \n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said: ''I have got worried on occasions that we have got the advice slightly wrong.'' \n\nThe family''s ordeal began on September 3, 2008 when Mr Hussain, Awais and his other son Samad, then 15, were ambushed by a masked robbers at the family home. \n\nThe gang, who wore balaclavas and carried 12-inch knives, had disabled security lights at the house and hid in bushes until the Muslim family returned from Ramadan prayers at their mosque. \nThe knifemen forced their way into the house and ordered Mr Hussain, his wife Shaheen, 47, and their sons and 18-year-old daughter Arooj to lie on the floor with their hands behind their backs. \n\nScreaming that they were going to kill them, the gang ordered the sobbing and terrified family to crawl from room to room. \n\nMr Hussain managed to break free and chased one of the burglars, career criminal Walid Salem, into a neighbour''s garden. \n\nSalem, 57, was attacked by a group of Asian men who beat him with a cricket bat and a metal pole, leaving him with a fractured skull and brain damage. \n\nMr Hussain and his brother Tokeer, who lives nearby, denied they were involved in that group attack, but admitted they had fought with Salem, who has more than 50 previous convictions. \n\nEnlarge    Victory: Awais Hussain, centre, the son of Munir Hussain, with barrister Razi Shah, left, and family members Qadeer Hussain, right, and Zahir Ahmed, left\nLord Judge, who sat with two other Appeal Court judges, refused to overturn the brothers'' convictions for causing grievous bodily harm with intent. \n\nHe said they had used an unlawful level of violence and were not acting in self defence because the burglars had left Mr Hussain''s home and the family were no longer in danger. \n\nHe said no court would condone ''mob violence'', adding: ''This is not and should not be seen as a case about the level of violence which a householder may lawfully and justifiably use on a burglar.''\n \nCrime scene: Munir had returned to his home in Desborough Road, High Wycombe, with his family when they were ambushed by three masked men\nBut he ruled that Mr Hussain had been ''provoked beyond endurance'' because he had feared the men were going to rape his wife and daughter and kill the entire family. \n\n''The plain, simple reality is that Munir Hussain was acting under the continuing influence of extreme provocation,'' Lord Judge said. \n\n''His involvement in this serious violence can only be understood as a response to the dreadful and terrifying ordeal and emotional anguish he had undergone.\n Still behind bars: Munir Hussain''s brother Tokeer had his 30-month sentence reduced to two years\n''His relief that he and his family were safe and his fury at what had happened combined to make a decent and peaceful man act entirely out of character, in hot blood.''\nRuling that Tokeer Hussain should remain in jail, the court said his case was different because it was his brother''s home and family which had been threatened by the armed robbers, and not his. \n\nHowever Lord Judge praised both men, saying they had ''impeccable positive good character'', and described Munir Hussain as ''a hard-working, peaceful, dedicated family man''. \n\nHe added: ''It is rare to see men of the quality of these two appellants in court for offences of serious violence.'' \n\nMr Hussain''s brother Qadeer, 45, said their 80-year-old father Zaman Ali had suffered two heart attacks since the break-in. \n\nHe added: ''We all ate together as a family that night at 9pm. Two hours later our lives changed completely. \n\n''That''s very difficult to come to terms with. It''s been our first experience in the legal arena. The most we had ever had before, within the whole family, was a parking ticket. \n\n''For a time I was afraid this was going to destroy our father''s faith in the British justice system. He came here in the 1950s because he believed Britain was the right place to raise a family.'' \nLock the evil burglar away, say his family Career criminal: Walid Salem, who avoided jail after breaking into Munir Hussain''s home \nCareer criminal Walid Salem''s own family described him as an ''evil, evil man'' yesterday and called for him to be locked away. \nThe armed thug''s ex-wife and his son said it was ''ridiculous'' that Munir and Tokeer Hussain had been jailed for assaulting Salem, while he was allowed to walk free. \nThe burglar has 54 previous convictions but was given a two-year supervision order after doctors said he was too brain damaged to enter a plea to charges of false imprisonment. \nProsecutors have called for him to undergo another medical assessment and warned he could still stand trial for false imprisonment, which carries a maximum life sentence. \nHis first wife, who asked not be named, said: ''Walid has always been a thief, and a leopard never changes his spots. He was always in and out of jail for stealing and even stole from shops that he worked in. He was also violent and once he punched me unconscious in front of my son. \n''He''s got what''s coming to him because he is an evil, evil man.'' \nEgyptian-born Salem, 57, has a shameful list of more than 50 convictions stretching back to 1980. \nDespite crimes including possessing a firearm, 22 fraud offences and 27 of theft, the longest prison sentence he received was 42 months. \nHe posed as an upstanding member of the community, even helping to organise a Neighbourhood Watch group near his home in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. \nHe married for the first time in 1976, after a whirlwind romance, and they had a son, Marc. \nBut after years of abuse and Walid being in and out of prison, he left his wife for another woman, whom he married in 1983. They have since had twins. \nMr Hussain''s family said he had been contacted in prison by a woman who claimed Salem and his gang had burgled her home and kept her family hostage. \nShe said the Crown Prosecution Service had dropped the case, which happened before the Hussain family were targeted. A CPS spokesman said there was no record of any such case. \nMr Hussain''s son Awais said he was ''disgusted'' that Salem had been free to target the family, despite his history of convictions. \n\n\nRead more: [url]http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1244668/Millionaire-businessman-Munir-Hussain-walks-free-court-jail-sentence-attacking-knife-wielding-burglar-overturned.html#ixzz0dn3KcOu5[/url]', ''),

CF98 though inexpensive, is a combat pistol which have been adopted by an army (hint: chinese handgun) and it has been exported and has been adopted by other armies as well. \n\nwhat does that tell ya? CF98 is designed for performance not looks. if these HP77, NP34, NP22 were that good, why would china invest so much money and resources in designing a new handgun for themselves. i''m sure any rational person would agree that it is alot easier to just copy a good design and adopt.\n\nEconomics also play a very important role here. you''ll have to follow me for a while here. you see, when u copy and clone a good design to very letter and spirit (to the minutest of details and quality wise). the price difference diminishes. so its pointless to clone a good handgun if it will eventually cost you the same. sure some difference in price will remain, depending on the difference in labor and raw material costs. but that difference is negligible. therefore, the only way to make a clone and make money in the process is to sacrifice somewhere. that sacrifice could be in from of manufacturing quality/performance or looks. now think gentlemen, if a clone is designed while sacrificing on the looks, it would definitely be "adoption worthy" cause its a good design to begin with and it performs good too. Then why the Chinese didn''t adopt the HP77, NP22, NP34? WHY NO OTHER ARMY HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THEM TOO?\n\nRegards.', ''),

There were however a couple of people that stood out and I would like to thank them personally. \n\n@[b]Omer571[/b], my friend. He is a man with a big heart and a great personality. It''s people like him who are pillars of our community and will InshAllah take it forward to great success. Hats off to you. Most of the GTG was organized and facilitated by him.

You are spoiling everyone''s habits Denovo, now whenever people are going to hear you are attending they will think "hmm, what are we getting this time" ;) \n\nDenovo also gets the "[b]Best Dressed Hunter[/b]" award in the history of PakGuns, never have I seen such a ''brand new'' and ''complete'' hunting kit.

Very passionate about hunting, having the ability to keep your patience and braving the elements to wait for the prey. The most important thing is that you are very aware of  your environment and "how much" one should hunt. If we all kill whatever crosses our sights then by the time our kids grow up there will be nothing left for them to enjoy and our beautiful and precious wildlife which is so magnificent on it''s own will disappear. We should all strive to discourage ''scoring'' in hunting. \n\n[b]A special thumbs up and kudo''s to the members who drove in, flew in, came by bus, by train from all over Pakistan to attend our Anniversary GTG.

We made a video for our members to kick off the GTG and Celebrate !! The weapon in the video belongs to me personally, is on my license, both of which were inspected by law enforcement personnel just before this video was made.

(86725, ' [quote=12gauge][quote=mitho]1- Slide and iron/steel parts are Manganese Phosphated\n2- It has a built in recoil buffer\n\ncare to elaborate.\nwhats built in recoil buffer?r u talking about the rotating barrel?[/quote]\n\n\nNo!, there is no such thing as built in buffer in CF98. what we are talking about is a spring built into the guide rod of CF98. that spring just keeps tension on the screw of the guide rod (its a two piece guide rod and no tension means that the screw will eventually unscrew itself). that tension is required so that the screw wont shake itself lose during firing.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\nDear bro, this is indeed a recoil buffer, here is my explaination\n\n1- The purpose of recoil buffer used in the handguns (specially ones the can fire P+ ammo and essential for ones with polymer frame) is to reduce the impact of slide on the frame under the pressure of the fired round to increase the life of gun.\n\n2- There are two kinds of recoil buffers used today, i) add ons are mostly silicon/rubber pads, ii)Spring type\n\n3- How it works? ones with silicon/rubber pads, principle is simple they just absorbs the energy, In spring based systems, it is usually built in guide rod and buffer spring is shorter and harder than the main spring, when the slide moves back under presser it depresses the main spring and when it reaches aprox 80-90 % of its travel, the tension of main spring increased enough to activate the buffer spring to slow down the slide speed aprox 30-50% (depends on the design) and avoids the hard impact of slide on the frame (act like a sort of shock absorber).\n\nNow let me explain why I think you are explanation is not correct.\n\nIn every gun design and you know much better than me that main criteria is the reliability and safety and now a day weight too and the cost to some extent, \ni) with more moving parts, there is more chance of failure.\nii) Economic point of view, there are more man hours needed to make (in this case) three piece guide rod (main rod, screwing with another one with spring to avoid unscrewing) don''t make sense. And if the weight was issue, they might have used polymer rod as they can make polymer frames and many manufacturers using polymer guides i.e. S&W, Barreta etc. or a hollow rod etc.\n\nhere is pic of CF 98 spring which I believe is recoil buffer.\n \n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=TsTpum9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/Tpum9.jpg[/img][/url]\nand let me add one more thing, rear part is a moving part.', ''),

Most of old and almost all local guns have this kind of surface treatment. This is a chemical process which is mainly used on iron products, this process chemically changes the metal surface and that new surface can absorb the oil and prevent the corrosion of the metal underneath. It is also the cheapest of all.\n\n2- [b]Phosphating[/b], it is also a chemical process to change the surface of iron product to prevent corrosion. Phosphating is also known as chemical depositing as in the process other metal/minerals are chemically deposited on the surface of base metal and adhere to it strongly. Most commons phosphating are Zinc Phosphate, Iron Phosphate, Manganese Phosphate and some other and combinations as well. Zinc Phosphate is light to some dark gray shade, Iron Phosphate is dark gray to black and Manganese Phosphate is gray to almost black.\nIn the firearms usually Iron and Manganese Phosphates are used Manganese Phosphate is used in almost all new weapon due to its quality to absorb the oil and good lubricant to moving parts and better wear resistance.\nAll phosphated surfaces are matt in finish.\n\n3- [b]Nickel and Chrome[/b] is also a metal depositing process but it is electro-chemical depositing of Nickel and Chrome on the surface of other metals or ABS plastics, it is very common and you can find lot house hold items nickel/chrome plated. This process is also called Electro-Plating. Surface is Bright white with Nickel and very shiny and glossy with Chrome. It is thicker than two above types.\n\n4- [b]Zinc Plating[/b] There are two types of Zinc plating i) Electro-Plating ii) Hot Dip. Electroplating is almost the same process as in Nickel/Chrome. Hot Dip is where the metal to be treated is dipped in molten Zinc.Zinc coating is also called Galvanizing.  Surface is matt in finish and light gray to gray in color. Most of the electric poles you find everywhere are Hot Dip.\n5- [b]Anodizing[/b], this process is used to treat the surface of Aluminum parts, it is electro-chemical process where a layer of Aluminum is deposited on the treated Aluminum part and the process makes the surface of parts harder and more corrosion and wear resistant. Parts can be colored to any desired color with a dip in hot color die.\n\nI have done all above procedures by my self except Hot Dip.', ''),

We can agree to disagree :)[/quote]\n\nOk bro, I understand ur point of view regarding a clone being better than an original design interms of form and fit but durability is a totally different matter altogether. kindly remove my following reservations regarding the durability of a clone.\n\n1. since same machinery/manpower is used and since u say it is better design then how come Chinese didnt adopt this well proven design. instead opted to spend (unnecessary) amounts of money in designing a new handgun.\n\n2. since quality/built wise NP22/34 and HP77 are better than CF98 how come they didn''t adopt it for their army?\n\n3. since NP22/34 and HP77 are much better weapons then how come none of the other countries that adopted CF98 didn''t even consider them.\n\n4. are u suggesting that a fake levis (not outsourced) and an original levis are of the same quality? lets put it this way, are u comparing a 2000 rupee levis to a 500 rupee levis and expecting same quality? i''m sure all of us would agree to this statement: "hmm.... I would rather buy a 500 rupee local brand denim (original idea) then buy a 500 rupee fake foreign brand denim (clone)".\n\n@AK47\n\nSir, [b]CF98 is my SHTF firearm[/b]. It sees the most use and [b]I still believe that is the best handgun out there in its price range[/b]. and on more than one occasion, i''ve said that [b]CF98 offers some interesting/new age design features[/b] but at the same time I firmly believe that [b]it has no class[/b]. of-course when I say class, at that particular point in time I''m actually comparing it to other handguns without considering the price. then again, you cannot expect low price and class at the same time from a single handgun or can you?\n\nRegards.', ''),

But there is no denying that TT variants are the most popular and wide spread weapon in Pakistan. I had been considering getting one for myself but did not like the TT''s commonly available in the market. About a year back I came across a TT in stainless steel finish online, I loved it. I have been looking for one since then but could not find it as the Stainless Steel finish was almost exclusively made for 9mm variants instead of 7.62. So I did the next best thing, if there is one weapon that Pakistani gun smiths can make better than any one and with their eyes closed, it''s the TT. I got the frame and slide made locally and got everything else substituted with foreign parts. Here is the result.\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT1.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT3.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT4.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT6.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/TT7.jpg[/img]\n\n\nAs with all new weapons specially locally made ones, they require a break in and even a shop adjustment period to come into their own.\n\nI have left the slide and all else blank for the time being as I want to get it engraved in the near future.

[b]it dampens the recoil of the gun[/b]. since the gun is recoil operated to begin with. meaning it softens the load cycling ability of the gun. if it dampens too much then the gun wont cycle reliably, if it dampens to less then its pointless to have a recoil buffer. either way if its a recoil buffer then its a very important piece of equipment  and must be factory calibrated to a specific load (not maximum). now since its factory calibrated then i''m sure manual shouldn''t show it two piece design and how it can be screwed-in back again. and yet gives no marking/level of the screw-in. meaning it isnt a recoil buffer, its not factory calibrated to a specific load and it can be routinely taken apart for cleaning purposes without even considering the effect it can have on recoil.\n\nRegards.[/quote]\n\n[b]Please try to understand, it doesn''t dampens the recoil, it even don''t engage in 90% of the recoil action.

Whats the material?[/quote]\n\nPer the Ergo webpage, ([url=http://www.ergogrips.net]www.ergogrips.net[/url])they are injection modeled, nylon-based polymer which are heavily textured to mimick the feel of skate-board tape. \n\nI have felt skate-board tape, and it is much rougher than the grips.  I won''t call them a waste of money just yet.  But I was looking for and expecting a much rougher grip than they have.  They may be a bit "grippier" than the wooden grips which came from the factory, but not significantly rougher and sharper.\n\n\n[quote]I wonder if you would be able to compare a Taurus 1911 with your Kimber 1911.[/quote]\n\nKimber has several different models with differing degrees of custom gunsmith work. \n\nI have fired a Taurus 1911 and I was pleased.  The main difference will not be in materials or design since both are steel construction 1911s.  The difference between the Taurus and my Kimber was the slide to frame fit, tightness of lock up, and trigger.\n\nKimber had a better slide to farme fit- there was less "play" when the slide cycled.  The Taurus was looser and wobbled around more when in the cycling process.  Loose helps more in comabt where the gun gets dirty and can tolerate more impedience in the slide to frame fit.\n\nKimber had a much tighter lock up- when the slide is fully forward with a round in battery, there was ZERO play.  It was tight like a tick.  This means that the sights were always in the same position to the barrel.  If the slide is loose when in battery the sights may not be in the same relationship to the barrel each time.\n\nKimber had a much shorter, smoother and lighter trigger.  The Taurus was not only longer and heavier but "gritty."  I could feel the metal catch and release during the trigger pull.  A smooth, light short trigger will aid the shooter in making better shots.  \n\nKimber has certain other gun-smith work- such as front trap checkering and under trigger guard checking, adjustable sights and so forth.\n\nKimber also had a match grade barrel, the Taurus an ordnance grade barrel. \n\n[url]http://www.kimberamerica.com/products/pistols/customshop/super_match_II/[/url]\n[url]http://www.taurususa.com/gun-selector-results.cfm?series=19&toggle=tp[/url]\n\n\nPlease understand you asked me to compare my top of the line Kimber with an a more production model Taurus.  My Kimber was $1700 US (now MRSP at $2250 US) while a Taurus 1911 would be maybe a third or even a quarter of what one could obtain a Taurus for.\n\nIt''s a bit of a performance car v. passenger car comparision.  They both get you there, one just does so at a higher cost and better materials and craftsmanship, however...\n\n\nI would have zero regrets owning a Taurus 1911.', '');

[/quote] \n\nits a free world (atleast in theory) and you have every right to disagree. however I must insist on saying that some of the most famous of weapons have been associated with national armies (or famous law enforcing agencies) around the world.\n\nif you look at the history. some of the famous firearms today got their fame when adopted by armies/lea around the world. glock, sig, baretta, HK almost all of them made their name after selection by some kinda army or LEA. since we are talking about a SIG clone, lets talk a little about it. nobody even knew about the merits of a SIG firearm before its adoption by Navy Seals. this should be enough to make a point that mass adoption (by some kinda armed force) does matter.\n\n[quote=Glocky]\nWe are comparing chinese handguns all made/exported by a single entity which is Norinco, [/quote]\n\nbro, yes you are right here we are comparing two handguns probably manufactured/exported by a single entity but at the same time we are also interested in knowing which one is better. not in terms of design, actually in terms of whole package which includes design, reliability and durability.\n\nI''m bent on the idea that CF98 is adopted by an army, its exported and adopted by other armies for some reason. whereas this NP22/34 clone is just a clone made to replicate the looks/feel of a real SIG. its primary objective is not to give the user a reliable combat handgun but to give the user the satisfaction of owning a handgun that looks like a SIG. think for a second, why would China commit so many resources in a producing a lesser durable (your statement) CF98 whereas it can always produce more durable (again ur statement) NP2/34 by diverting the same resources. later on adopt the more durable clone instead of CF98.\n\nall this does not add up. but if you think like this then it certainly adds up. NP22/34 are mere clones produced to replicate the looks of a real SIG, not performance or durability. therefore for a combat handgun to be adopted by an army/military/LEA, durability is a must. CF98 is built by keeping durability in mind so its only natural that they adopted CF98.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nmy whole argument is that NP22/34 should not be compared to an original design CF98. after owning an original design CF98 and a Chinese manufactured SIG clone (for a very short period I took it back to shop as soon as I came back to my senses, later I opted to buy the CZ999 scorpion) i''m a firm believer now and will never advise anyone to compare the two.\n\nRegards.', ''),

(87095, ' [b]Malik orders inquiry into arms licenses [/b]\nPakistan Times Federal Bureau\n\nISLAMABAD: Federal Interior Minister Rehman Malik on Tuesday gave orders to hold inquiry into licenses issued for banned bore during the last seven years. \n\nSpeaking to media after attending the meeting of National Assembly Standing Committee on Interior here, he said that a US training facility located at Sahala in Rawalpindi was completely shut down. \n\nHowever, on complaint of US embassy, Washington been offered to shift this program at any other location, he said, adding the US is spending $20 million on this program. \n\nTo a scandal about arms licenses, he said that bribery of Rs100,000 to Rs100,500 was taken for issuing licenses for banned pistol. He said that screening would be made for all arms’ licenses issued during the last seven years. \n\nWhen asked to comment about status of Hakimullah Mehsud, he said that there were unconfirmed reports about the death of TTP chief.  \n\nMeanwhile, another report says; Interior Minister Rehman Malik Tuesday acknowledged the US support for anti-terror training of Pakistan Police Officers and pledged to soon provide alternate training location to foreign experts working at Sihala. \n\nAfter successful US initiative; Australian and French experts would also be arriving in the country to impart modern terror-combat training to civilian law enforcement agencies of Pakistan, Malik told journalists at Parliament House.\n\nHe said US experts were supporting Pakistan under a mutual understanding, signed between the two countries in 2003 -when Pervez Musharraf was in power. However, the ministry of Interior has  taken  them out from Sihala Police Training College due to security reasons and in response the overwhelming public demand.  \n\nWe do acknowledge the US support for raising standard of our police and for improving professional capabilities of civilian law enforcing personnel. They have done well and we shall provide them with alternate training facility, said the Minister. It was a positive initiative on part of the US administration and now France and Australia have shown their interest to send experts too, he added.\n\nThe US has also spent around Rs 20 million  on training of police officers. Let us take this initiative as positive because the government spends million of rupees on studies and training of police officials in foreign countries, however, now these countries are coming for our support at our home, Malik said.\n\nTo a question, he said that the arms licenses scam was under investigation and all licenses issued during last seven years were being scanned for checking their authenticity. So far some one hundred fake licenses have been identified as three FIA teams are probing the matter, he added.\n\n[b]Malik said it was a big network of arms dealers, section officers and other people. Some of them including a man Jamil Abbasi and a few section officers have already been arrested. He said that security scanners in the capital have been tested today and they would be installed at some locations within a couple of days.[/b]\n\nReplying to another query, Rehman Malik said that National Registration Authority (NARA) would be re-activated to ensure more collaborative measures for security mechanism and for the purpose the authority has been assigned to register all foreign workers as well as students including  those studying in Deeni Madaris and universities in the country.\n\n[b]Source: [url]http://pakistantimes.net/pt/detail.php?newsId=7849[/url][/b]', ''),

(87107, ' And if you www more than practical and technical, here is the article.\n\nThe Frame Saver Dual Action Recoil Buffer Spring System replaces your existing recoil spring with a superior design and function - no modifications are required!\n\nWhen firing a modern pistol, the slide flies backward at great speed, and then comes to an immediate stop against the frame during recoil. This force and impact to the frame is constantly weakening the slide and vibrating the internal parts, causing cracks and malfunction and turning movements in the shooters wrist. This sudden impact causes a violent muzzle jump which temporarily throws the gun off target and upwards, causing a need for dual-action buffers. \n\n[b]Advantages:[/b] \n\n[b]Impact[/b]: The elimination of the slide impacting the frame at high speed preserves the structure of the firearm - and your rather significant investment! \n\n[b]Muzzle Control[/b]: By changing the final backward movement of the slide from a sudden stop to a progressive stop, muzzle jump is greatly decreased by 40% giving you more control. \n\n[b]Function[/b]: No interference of ejection port or any feeding problems. \n\n[b]Progressive[/b]: This is a system designed to reduced the backward motion of the slide in progressive stages after the gun is shot. The effect of this system is that the recoil is reduced by 40% making your follow up shots much easier to shoot. This is a VERY effective system. \n\n[b]Stability[/b]: Better stability for your barrel. Stainless steel guide rod replaces plastic guide rods for superior barrel support and function. \n\n[b]Better Accuracy[/b]: Progressively slows down your slide from heavy impact against the frame. Works just like a car shock absorber, reducing the slide impact. Lower impact means less recoil, accurate recovery of the weapon for on-target accuracy is better achieved, shot after shot. Even expert shooters can benefit from lower recoil. \n\n[b]Lower Frame Shock[/b]: The slide is one of the heaviest components in a semi-automatic pistol. Upon firing, the slide slams back with great energy against the frame. Frame Saver Dual Actions springs can lower this slide impact dramatically, preventing excessive wear, cracked slides and damaged frames, particularly on modern polymer framed pistols such as Glock''s, Sigma''s & HK''s.', ''),

Even glock got their fame after they got adopted by Law enforcing agencies in the U.S. before that it was regarded as a cheap plastic handgun.\n\nyou gave the example of Taurus92 and Chinese made TT and Maks. well, back in those days, Russia used to give their machinery and expertise to anyone who used to think that Capitalism is bad. the Chinese TT  and MAKs were all built using Russian exported machinery and expertise. Just like Taurus which are actually built on Baretta machinery. therefore taking them as an example is irrelevant. but even then i''m sure if u pick up a chinese TT and a Russian TT you can easily tell that Russian TT is far better built. I have one and can testify to their superior quality over the Chinese. it''s actually my uncle''s to be precise. he has a chinese TT too but older model with all markings in chinese language. and guess what even its quality seems alot superior to the currently available TT in the market. similarly, i''ve heard it from a few friends that Russian AK is better built than a Chinese. you see no matter what you do, an original remains an original. that is my whole argument.\n\nand on the basis of this argument, I think its unfair to compare an original idea CF98 to a clone HP77/NP34/22.\n\nRegards.', ''),

Bullets weight and muzzle velocities can vary with change in manufacturer and the type of handgun from which the bullet is fired. Just for comparison, a 9x19 mm Parabellum or Lugar has an average bullet weight of 7.45 grams (FMJ) and average velocity of 352 to 427 m/s.

The usefulness of .380 ACP, however, lies in its suitability for use in small size CC handguns. \n\n[b]Makarov fires 9x18 mm Makarov cartridge which is different in size and weight from .380 ACP. 9x18 mm Makarov and .380 ammo is therefore NOT interchangeable.

I meant .380 ACP, ie, 9x17mm Short and not .38 ACP.:). And accordingly, I have made corrections in my original post.  \n\nHowever, 9x23 mm cartridge that you are mentioning is also not called .38 ACP. There are two variants of 9x23 mm available; one is .38 Super Automatic or 9x23SR, commonly known as .38 Super which was originally developed by Colt for use in Colt M1911 Government Model pistols. \nThe other one is 9x23 Largo, also called 9mm Bergmann-Bayard. Basically developed in Germany, this cartridge was more commonly used in Spanish made pistols. \nregards', ''),

After that their living buddies used to hover around over me if I was out with my air gun but otherwise left us alone.

If it is than please let me know the source as a friend of mine is looking for some as he owns a Beretta in this caliber.\n\nWhy opt for it as a SD gun? When compared with a 9mm, there could be two reasons, one its easier to control and the other one I can''t really think of!

There are  40 million American who have this problem. I do not know how many Pakistani suffer with this problem? Probabaly in the thousends but goes undiagnosed and untreated. Insomania is a cause of  many many physical problems from tiredness to heart attack. Sleep deprivation is used as measure to obtain information from suspected criminals with good reults. Those who can not sleep for them it is a torture. \n               Sleep is a physiological state. It is a complex biological phenomenon; which is after thousends of years of research\nyet, it remains a mystery. First mentioned  by Hypocrites  2500 hunderds yeras ago in his writting and prescribed hypnotics and prayer to God of sleep "Hypnosis", the father of modern medicine.  Indian Yervadec medicne described it as a curse to man kind, inducing sleep by meditation and  sleep medications asuch as Banhg and opium. nothing is full proff.\n                        What causes insomania, well several reasons  that we now understand and several reasons are still uncovered. Sleep is a rhythm  cycle called circadian rhythm which is controled by a"Master Clock" located somewhere in our barin. It has 25 hours rather than 24 hours/day.  Sleep is divided into 4 stages: Half awake and half sleep, secondly,light sleep, then deep sleep, last stage is deepest sleep; difficult to awaken. The last stage mimic total paralysis of major muscles. This happens 90 minutes after the initial stage. Put to gatgher these 4 stages called Non Rapid eye movement.\n                          Those who has sleep problem they do not go through these stages or just sleep for 9 or ten minutes and then wide awake.

There are  40 million American who have this problem. I do not know how many Pakistani suffer with this problem? Probabaly in the thousends but goes undiagnised and untreated. Insomani is a cause of  many many physical problems from tiredness to heart attack. Sleep deprivation is used as measure to obtain information from suspected criminals with good reults. Those who can not sleep for them it is a torture. \n               Sleep is a physiological state. It is a complex biological phenomenon; which is after thousends of years of research\nyet, it remains a mystery. First mentioned  by Hypocretes  2500 hunderds yeras ago in his writting and prescribed hypnotics and prayer to God of sleep "Hypnosis", the father of modern medicine.

Sleep is a rhythm  cycle called circadian rhythm which is controled by a"Master Clock" located somewhere in our barin. It has 25 hours rather than 24 hours/day.  Sleep is divided into 4 stages: Haalf awake and hale sleep, secondly,light sleep, thendeep sleep, last stage is deepest sleep; difficult to awaken. The last stage mimic total paralysis of major muscles. This happens 90 minutes after the initial stage. Put to gatgher these 4 stages called Non Rapid eye movement.\n                          Those who has sleep problem they do not go through these stages or just sleep for 9 or ten minutes and then wide awake.

However, the like eagles they are also raptors, and like all raptors, they are protected by law, an it is illegal to kill them. The reson these birds are taking a swipe at you every now and then is that it is the onset of their breeding season these days, and most birds have paired up and are building nests while a few might still be courting. The birds harrassing you, are doing it as they probably see you as a possible threat to their nest and their young in the near future. \n\nThe only sensible advice I have seen here is by Sikandar Panhwar, and like he has suggested you can either put up a scarecrow, or better still, toss out a few scraps of meat to these birds every morning or evening. This way the birds will come to see you as a friend rather than a threat.[/quote]\n\nAnd there will days when he will be unable to give them meat and than eagles will seriously become aggressive.[/quote]\n\n[quote=Usama]And dont even try feeding them!!

Thank you so much for corresponding with us.\n\nTo begin with, Armscor do not make the "Tanfoglio" pistols, they are manufactured in Italy.  We only assemble them here in our plant after the barrel re-chambering operation.\n\nYes, you are correct Sir.  The "Viper" which is sold entirely in Pakistan is identical to the "Force" model and it is also identical to the "MAPP1" or "APP9" (which is sold here in Philippines).  All these pistols are identical but with different brand names only.  The brand names, aside from being the importer''s special specification, it also enable the manufacturer to identify the specific location where the product had been delivered.\n\nShould you have other inquiries, please let us know.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n:-) willie\nWilfredo D Lagundino\nArms Corporation of the Philippines \nArmscor Avenue, Barangay Fortune, \nMarikina City 1800, Philippines \nTel.

(87418, ' On television and in the movies, one shot from an handgun drops the bad guy, or a shot throws the bad guy across the room. It would seem the handgun is the ultimate self-defense weapon. However, these are special effects, not real life. Any hand fired projectile that strikes a person with enough force to throw the person backward, will also throw they person who fired it backward (equal and opposite reaction). When it comes to self-defense, you want to stop the attacker from pursing the attack. While this may involve killing the attacker, it may only involve incapacitating the attacker. Thus handguns should be rated according to their stopping power not their killing power. Handgun Stopping Power -The Definitive Study, by Marshall and Sanow, list some facts about handgun stopping power:\n\n*Knocked down does not mean knocked out.\n  \n*There is no predictable and reliable medical reason for a person to fall and become "instantly incapacitated" from a gun shot with the exception of a wound to the brain stem.\n    \n*Sometimes the bullet will produce no visible effect at all. It may take 30-90 seconds or even longer for the person to fall.\n    \n*Even if shot placement is good and vital tissue is damaged, it is reasonable to expect the person to remain mobile, active and hostile for 10 to 5 seconds after the shot.\n   \n*Pain inflicted on a person, even extreme pain, should never be confused with incapacitation. Neither does the simple act of falling to the ground upon bullet impact constitute incapacitation.\n   \n*Bullet effectiveness can be extremely slow even when the bullet perforates the heart, collapses both lungs or cuts open the aorta. Imagine how slow bullet effectiveness can be if vital organs like these escape its damage.\n\n*First shot hit probability for law enforcement officers varies from 25 to 65 percent. Frequently the majority of shots will miss the target.\n\n[b]In reality the shot placement and tactical awareness is much more needed than a fancy round.Policemen world over use double taps when firing and even if you look at footage from gun battle on tv or net most policeman will fire multiple shot before stopping to asses.In real life gun battles i cannot go with the attitude that "if i cannot finish the fight in 2-3 rounds I have the wrong tool" .No one seriously expect to stop shooting back afetr 3,5,7 rounds.[/b]\n\n[b]Shot placement,tactical awareness and a knowledge of human anatomy/psychology is much more important than the caliber of the weapon you hold.[/b]', ''),

However, as some of us have noticed the correct procedure seems to elude most of us.  Sooo, today I woke up with nothing to do and sat in front of the computer and decided to give my forum brothers a small write up of what I have been told/experienced regarding this matter; if you feel something is missing or wrong - please feel free to contact your nearest Pakistan Customs official as they ARE helpful. \n  \nFirstly, I am going to discuss Pakistan as most of us are always assuming that its not the export rather the import that is difficult in Pakistan... NOT true.  Upon arrival of your item(s) in Pakistan - Customs must be cleared first.  And this is what the customs duties are - I will give the example of the Beretta 92FS which came in the market a few months ago.\n1. Customs Appraiser Calculations/Dollar Rate (in this case it was 84.50rs=1USD)\n2. Value in Pak rupees = 41365rs\n3. Custom Duty 35% = 14477rs\n4. Regulatory Duty 15% = 6204rs\n5. Sales Tax 18% = 11168rs\n6. Income Tax 4% = 1464rs\n7. Federal Excise Duty 1% = 413rs\nTotal Duties 73% = 33726rs\nNow, you ADD the Value 41365rs + Duties 33726rs = 75091rs per pistol.\nRemember, this is the cost of pistol and duties ONLY.  The items(s) didn''t grow wings, fly and land in Pakistan!!!  It came in via a carrier airline, there are cargo charges, there are cargo storage charges for each junction this specific cargo was stopped/stored - those charges also need to be added to this total.\nAside from this you WILL need the following thing to present to the Customs:\n1. NTN\n2. Sales Tax Registration\n3. Letter from Ministry of Commerce stating that you can import this item(s) AND a current dated letter stating that you have NOT already used the initial issued letter already for verification purposes.\n4. Invoice and the Packing List (very very important as the packing list explains what all is with each item(s)).\nI would strongly recommend that one has all the documents ready either before or by the time of item(s) arrival - any delays will add further charges and increase chances of further paperwork headaches.\n\nSecondly, now we talk about exports of such items from country(s).  There are many countries which have a ban on most if not all types of such items export to Pakistan... Canada for example put a specific ban on Pakistan after we conducted our N. Tests..  I will try and discuss US in this case as most of the "goody two shoes" item(s) are available/designed come from there.  The Dept of State, DOD, has basic export rights of shipments to Pakistan.  Their average time is stated to be 45 days; however, this can lag on for up to and over 6 months for approval and there are NO guarantees that the export will be approved regardless of prior approval.  It would seem to me that this is probably due to the various personnel approving the paper work and well if ones is having a bad day - why not take it out on someone else......  Remember there are NO Constitutional Rights regarding exports to argue - you are at the whim judgement of a clerk!!!\n1. Payment - where ever you order from - they each will have their own method of dealing with payments.  If its a large a amount - a letter of Credit from MCB will/should suffice.  Money Orders are generally not accepted from our country as they do NOT contain the routing codes; hence, most local banks in the US because they are soooo advanced, don''t know what or how to feed the Check in their system.  Wire Transfer seems to be the best bet, it is secure and leaves a proper LEGAL track as to where the money went and what it was for.  And ofcourse if you have it - as per most US Company requests - any North America issued Credit Card can be used.\n2. Clearly State what you want to place an order for, quantity, finish.. etc written out on your Company letter head.\n3. One must fill out form DSP83.\n4. An Affidavit is needed to state that these are civilian/nonmilitary purpose items and NOT for reexport or such.\n5. An End User Certificate stating the same thing.\nThere will be a fee for handling this process and it varies from company to company in the US...\n\nI do hope that now that most of us have a better understanding of what it takes to place orders.  And so the next time we tell our dealer/importer that their costs are too high remember two things:\n1. That this person without any guarantees of approval/sales paid in advance for those items, basically that person blocked their money for an unspecific time to purchase the item(s).  And the dollar keeps on climbing high against the Rupee each month.\n2. After all, It is generally an item(s) that NOT everyone has, and you want.  And one can''t put a price on interests.', ''),

Are you justifying the enormous ripoff prices dealers charge than the actual costs of import and dealer margin ? Second whats with the dollar rate example, two years back when the USD/PKR parity was around 62 chinese ammo cost nearly 40-45 a piece, now with the parity at 86 chinese ammo cost at most 34 retail. Similarly Glocks, Berettas and the likes were selling for 300k+ and 250k respectively, they are now actually lower than what they were. I agree its probably demand/supply.

And its a simple matter of Supply and Demand, in the early 2000s the glocks were high priced because one simply couldn''t find one.  On the latter the markets are now flooded with Glocks.  You do the math 100 glocks at lets say a purchase price of 30000rs each, how much is that tied up?  And for how long?  Why shouldn''t that person charge accordingly.  This is not computers or other things like that.  Take imported cars - they have gone up in value NOT because of high dollar - rather due to current ban on imports.  A Corolla X was 12lacs before the ban and now its up to 18Lacs.  Even I feel the pinch sometimes when the dealer asks a high price on something and complain; however, I have no choice as I know I can''t get the item myself and as a result have to buy from the dealer. :)', ''),

(87639, ' Thank you everyone. I have had the opportunity to test the CZ999 to my satisfaction. Fired about 300 rounds in two sessions of 150 each with different ammo without cleaning. No issues or jams. \n\nIn the 300 round test I noticed a few things, point wise might make is easier to me to remember.\n\n1). The recoil is surprising. It''s has the least recoil of almost any 9mm that I''ve ever used. The Zigana sport has the same low recoil but that is a range gun and also has ported everything.\n\n2). It is extremely accurate. Right out of the box I was hitting bull''s at 15 M. Infact my first and second shots both were bulls, and so centered that it did not even touch the small circle line. I was joking with Munir sahib that after those shots I should just pack up and go home because that would be hard to outdo. This is one of those guns that you can''t blame if you aren''t hitting your target, the error is of the shooter, the gun itself is perfect.\n\n3). Rapid fire is very accurate as the barrel does not lift much. If I hit one bull I was sure if I fired 10 more shots in fast succession it would not land in anything except 9 or at the max 8.  \n\n4). The gun cycles all kind of ammo correctly. I used three variety of Chinese rounds, 4 varieties of Russian rounds and Armscor FMJ''s. All 8 types of ammo worked perfectly. \n\n5). The decocker is very useful, works great. However loading a single round into the barrel manually is not possible like the Beretta 92/ Taurus 92/99. Manual loading won''t work, the round has to be loaded from the magazine or the slide won''t close properly.\n\n6). The magazines although "cheapish" in quality work fine. \n\n7). The trigger reset is a little late, I would have preferred it if it was a little deep for a quicker reset. \n\n8). There were also some concerns that the pieces imported by G.M Dossal were of cheap quality and the frame paint wears off completely while cleaning. This is not the case with my piece which I almost dunked in Hoppes No:9 powder solvent to test. The problem mainly lies with weapons bearing the serial number in 7000''s. The 8000 series which is the one I have is fine.\n\n\nHere is a 10 M target from today range session with the CZ999. Anything that wasn''t in the dead center was simply shooter error. \n\n[img]http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii99/AbbasMalik/CZtarget.jpg[/img]\n[b]\nFinal Verdict: I am simply in love with this pistol.

Any preferred choices ?[/quote]\n\n\n[b]AoA Everybody.[/b]\n\nsince you are asking about a reasonable purchase between equally priced (approx) items such as CF98 as original design/idea and NP22/34 (SIG clones) then do consider the following:\n\n1. when equally priced, a design which is original and has the backing of the the largest military in the world (Chinese army) is definitely worth considering over equally priced clones which have no such backing.\n\n2. when equally priced, an original design which is also being adopted by armies of other countries is definitely worth considering over equally priced clones that are not even considered to adoption by other armies. if those clones were that good they should have been exported atleast to other armies/law enforcing agencies\n\n3. when equally priced, a clone offers the LOOKS (OF A REAL THING), reliability, durability and fit. whereas an original idea only offers reliability, durability and fit. since both are equally priced items. some sacrifices have to be made in the manufacturing (build process) of the clone to make it more economically feasible. whereas an original idea (design) is not limited to any such constraints.\n\n4. when equally priced, an original design goes through all the necessary testing, benchmarking before being deemed for full time production. there are no such constraints for a clone.\n\n5. when equally priced, an original design is produced to give a fully functional firearm only. whereas a clone also has to appeal (appeal to the user that wants something that looks like a real thing). so we can safely assume that [b]LOOKS[/b] played a major part in its construction.\n\n[b]Bottom Line:[/b]\n\nwhen equally priced (I think i''m stressing that point enough) always choose an original design/idea over a clone. now, i''m not saying that a cheap inexpensive, say $10 original design firearm is better than a $1000 clone. all i''m saying is [b]a $100 original design is better than a $100 clone[/b].\n\nRegards.', ''),

I then just feel, for a person like me, who usually keeps a live round, the hammer "cocked" position not very favorable, in spite of the grip safety feature.\n\nFirst of all, the hammer in constant cocked position, I feel, would, more or less, be detrimental to some part of the hammer mechanism coz it induces some sort of "strain" in being pulled back constantly?\n\nSecond, I feel, during a [b]quick[/b] and [b]emergent[/b] draw, with a [b]cocked[/b] hammer and [b]live round[/b], there''s a risk of [b]unintended discharge[/b], in that you unholster the gun in one quick movement, where you do place your hand on the grip AND a finger on trigger/trigger guard, while palm of your hand will be covering the grip and the grip safety, which doesn''t quite need much of a force to get pressed in for activation of trigger mechanism. Remember here, your gun is in SA mode, which also doesn''t require any great force at all by your index finger, which from the moment you start unholstering the gun and till you start pointing at the threat, most likely already is right there on the trigger course! This CAN result in unintended discharge, somehow.\n\nI do not want to discredit the gun or it''s function as such, no, not by any means at all, it''s one heck of a century old wonder-piece and perhaps the most potent, reliable and vastly used combat handgun in the world.\n\n I''m only referring to the abrupt and plausible use, during a threatened situation, with no time to start racking the gun or even to pull the trigger back, course your offender already has the "surprise" factor with him, I feel it''s somehow more advise-able to have a [b]direct strike[/b] feature as in guns with both [b]SA/DA[/b] feature.

Go to a shop and try which one fits best in your hand. The one which feels the best, get it (if money is not an issue). If you are under a budget, straight away go for CF98 (light and more accurate) or HP 77B (heavy but strong body) which are cheap nowadays.   \n\nAnother criterion for selection could be that if you have a liking for Sig P226, go for NP22 or HP 77B or NP34 if you want a compact model. If you like CZ75 the best (which sure I do :)), go for NZ85 and if you want an original reliable design, go for CF98.

The factories in Peshawar now a days using strong plastic frame for the clones i.e. SW9, Glock, CZ100 etc. (these are not high impact polymer/plastic, these are those plastics/polymer you are talking about, and these are not as reliable as high impact polymer/plastic used in foreign hand guns).

The one available at PARA had polymer frame.  There is a compact model also available with 93 mm barrel. Price was 50 K. A very good buy indeed. :)', ''),

(87945, ' Here is the travelog of my Leopard hunt, one of my Favorite trophy.\n\n\nMay 2007 Zimbabwe, we were driving on the Matusadona park boundary road checking for buffalo tracks crossing from the park into our concession, Omay Safari Area. At about 8:30 we found tracks of two dagga boys, nick name for old Buffalo Bulls, known for their temperament. We followed the tracks for two hour before spotting the bulls, my PH declared the bigger one to be a 39-40” class bull and asked if I want to take it. I was undecided but after reviewing my surroundings, I noticed the bait tree, where we have been sitting for a very promising leopard for five previous nights, I replied in negative as thought came in my mind that shooting the Buffalo here would jeopardize our Leopard setup. \n\nWhen we arrived in Omay area my hunting license allowed me 1 leopard and 1 buffalo my father had 1 lion and 1 buffalo bull on his permit, we were hunting on 2X2 basis.\n\nI usually like to work hard for good trophies of the query that I am after and instead of shooting mediocre specimen, I will rather return empty handed with the thrill of the chase. \n\n(Bait animals)\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/DSCN1044.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/DSCN1039.jpg[/img]\n\nI discussed my plan with my PH and we decided to hunt for a particular big leopard that used to live in the Hogvy valley within the concession. This cat has been unsuccessfully hunted before by both our PHs on different occasions and they were convinced that it is a very cunning and big leopard and due to the large leopard population, the hunter hunting leopard in this area usually gets their leopard very easily and thus the PHs avoided this particular leopard for other easily available males. The reason this leopard was difficult to get was that he would hit a bait and then disappear and then would hit again few days later and after second time will usually never return.  \n\nDay six of the hunt: My father’s PH reported that the big leopard has hit one of my father’s lion bait and he has now converted the previous lion bait into a leopard bait for us. \n\n(Tracks of a big leopard)\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/DSCN1037.jpg[/img]\n\nKnowing this leopard, my Ph decided not to sit for first two days, after that we will sit every day until we get him or the end of the hunt, this was our plan.\n\n(Blind)\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/DSCN1094.jpg[/img]\n\nOur blind was built on top of a hill, which was fairly wooded area and beneath us was the Hogvy river, which was flowing with ankle deep water. Across the river was the bait tree, the distance of bait from blind was 110yards, this was deliberate as my PH knew that the further we sit the less chance of being detected. \n\n(Bait, notice the log underneath)\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/DSCN1092.jpg[/img]\n\nOur blind was positioned on the edge of a hill, which was a 500 yards walk from a dirt track, which separated our concession from the Matusadona park. The setup was perfect, we could walk into the blind without being noticed from the valley.     \n\nWe sat five nights without any luck, there were hyenas that would come to the bait regularly, there were also lots of elephant in the area and on occasions they came very close to the blind, I always kept an extra 375 loaded with solids for them.\n\nOne the sixth day our hopes were getting low on getting this leopard, it has been eight days since he initially fed. As I was walking to the blind with my PH carrying my two rifles, I noticed that I had forgot my jacket in the cruiser, it gets very cold after the sunset. We settled in the blind at 4:45 and the plan was to wait until 7:30 for the leopard. In the blind, I was evaluating my decision of not shooting that Buffalo earlier that morning, a 40 incher is good for this area. At 6:00 the silence was broken by warning calls from Baboon coming from a distance, than we heard a Leopard call from far away, we were not sure if this was the same leopard. About half an hour later the leopard called again, this time it was slight nearer, this kept on for two hours when we heard him call very close may be 300 yards from the blind. It was silent after that and with each passing moment I was wondering if the leopard is going to avoid the bait, why is he calling? Either he is not going to hit the bait or he is too sure that no one will be at the bait waiting for him. \n\nHalf an hour later we heard him starting to feed, Steve waited for few minutes then turned the light on, I saw the leopard on the branch but it jumped out of the tree into a bush underneath the tree. Steve switched the light off and told me its him and the if he feeds again he will put the light on and I must shoot him as quickly as possible. We waited for five minutes and we heard him feed again, Steve told me to get ready, as soon as the light was put on again, I found the Leopard in the scope, who was sitting like a dog on the branch and placed the shot just behind the shoulder. The leopard fell out of the tree rolled on the bank and then got up and ran towards the hill right in between the blind and the bait. We were convinced that he was hit hard but he went into thick cover and to go after him in night would be very hazardous, however, we decided that we can’t leave him there as lion and hyenas will definitely get him and ruin the trophy. After waiting 15 minutes we went into the thick stuff after him. There was a continuous blood trail for the tracker to follow, we found him 60 yards from the bait dead beside a bush. He was an excellent leopard, one that I will cherish whenever I see him in our trophy room.       \n\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/DSCN1055.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x90/Ahmedsultan/Leopard1.jpg[/img]', ''),

I have tried this Ballistic Bag thing in my initial try but this time i have tried different making process for this bag and it also has a stabilizer tail. \n\n[b]Material:[/b]  Soft Cotton\n[b]Loads:[/b] Plastic Clay and Lead Pellets (4# Shaheen)\n[b]Sealing Method: [/b]Their own Star Crimp (No Glue or anything else)\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts19Aeti][img]http://s2.postimage.org/19Aeti.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nI made 8 ballistic bags, four of them filled with plastic clay and others with Lead Pellets and all have with stabilizer tail made by using that same cotton. I hope above photo is pretty much understandable and no need to go in details. So here are few more photos. \n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqx1cJS][img]http://s3.postimage.org/x1cJS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVj6AXr][img]http://s4.postimage.org/j6AXr.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVj6KW0][img]http://s4.postimage.org/j6KW0.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxTqO2r][img]http://s1.postimage.org/TqO2r.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nAs you can see in above last 2 photos there are three skeet shells and one is #8, actually these were laying around someone’s home so he gave to me to use them when I was planning to buy a Box of #4 Shaheen. So initially I prepared these 4 and later after buying my own I added 4 more (#4 Shaheen). \n\n\n[b]RANGE REPORT:[/b]\n\n[b]Target: [/b]Printed Paper A4size (8 inches in diameter)\n[b]Distance:[/b] 50 Feet\n\nBefore writing further, Just want to tell you guys who don’t know this before [b]“This is my second ever target shooting with a Shotgun and I still don’t have any gun and waiting for my first license"[/b]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=gxTrgZ9][img]http://s1.postimage.org/TrgZ9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nAs you can see in the above photo, I used a piece of cardboard and placed an old blanket (folded) and lastly paper target on the top. (Easy Target Making)\n\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Ts19BiP9][img]http://s2.postimage.org/19BiP9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=Pqx5rD9][img]http://s3.postimage.org/x5rD9.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aVj7PgS][img]http://s4.postimage.org/j7PgS.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\nAbove photos are showing 5 shots on the paper so what happened to other 3 shots. So here is the story. \n\nIn all 8 shots, two were a kind of miss fire (they fired but had not enough force) and lots of unburned powder leftover in the barrel.  The third shot was tried by the other guy (gun’s owner) He was sitting on his tows (Not a firing position at all) and was not expecting that much kick from that particular shot he fired specially after seeing initial soft bangs, So it hit on the wall right above the target. You can see that ballistic bag’s remains on the right side in the above photos and other ballistic bags were pretty much in shape in the left side and good to use for the second time. \n\n\n[b]CONCLUSION: [/b]\n\nThough my this second experiment is a success if considering its target results but it also remains with few concerns which I experienced during my range day. \n\nThere was 8 shots, two of them was a kind of miss fires (like i mentioned before) and couple of shots had minor bangs (Not has enough force or kind of soft shots).\n\n\nIn my opinion there could be couple of results behind this misfortune.\n\n1.	These particular shots could be faulty. \n2.	They may soaked some moisture because I have done this modification 2 months back and this time I didn’t use any glue to seal them. \n\nRight now I am not sure what was the exact reason behind this but surely will take care all these consideration in my future experiments and will share it with you guys. \n\n\nI hope you will like this second part of my modification series. Inshallah there will be more in future. \n\nLooking forward for your positive feedback. \n\nRegards,', ''),

(88113, ' Dear Brothers,\n\nTilting or swinging barrel lock is an invention of John Moses Browning realised at beginning\nof last century.\n\nOn this system, barrel, via arched transversal ribs on its top, locates within counterrecessed  \ngrooves cut inside of slide ceiling, and both member remain locked during discharge until  pressure\ndrops to a safe level, and, backward recoil momentum together with remaining gas pressure,\ndraws the duo as the barrel going out  of locked mode by aid of a link or links mounted axially\nrotatable on the receiver...  And slide goes rearward to carry out usual extracting, ejecting, cocking \nand reloading tasks then.\n\nWith two links at both end of barrel, the system could be named as "Elevating Barrel" at beginning\nbut at end of first decade of last century, Mr. Browning changed  it to "Tilting" as deleting the front\nlink and leaving the barrel to swing down and up over the one mounted under the breech end by\nreciprocal movement. This is the combination still used  Colt 1911 and lookalikes.\n\nRivals of the system on those days were, Turning or Rotating Larrel lock, again an  invention of Browning''s\nbut perfected by European inventors later, and various types of Swinging Block constructions like Mauser''s\nC96 which the first of all successfull auto loading pistol world...\n\nBrowning''s Tilting Barrel was the most cost saving of all and natural selecting brought it to this time as a\nchampion in recoil operated locked breech pistols field. There are still Turning Barrel and Swinging Block\nlocked pistols like  Beretta Cougar for former and Beretta F92 for latter kinds but The manufacturer''s favorite\nof all the time remained as Tilting Barrel type .\n\nHandicap of this kind is lack of accuracy as compared to other two types by cause of needed barrel motion\nboth rear and downside...Other two, having only backward movement, hold a notable advantage on shooting\naccuracy...But Swinging Block types being costly to manufacture, and Turning Barrel kind being slightly upper\ncost but lacking some tactical advantages  as both being behind of Tilting Barrel by choice of manufacturers.\n\nIntroduction of Browning HP added another construction for barrel swinging motion by lug and cam application\nand SIG 210, later, gave another addition to the system by "Kidney Shaped Camming Hole" which as being\nnearly most strong and simple  construction on this field still used especially CZ 75 and lookalikes. Other \nchanges during the full a century can not be named as an innovation and Tilting Barrel Lock remained nearly\nunchanged all along the time from first invented to the this time... However, introduction of 220 Series of \nS?g Sauers revived the application of front face of ejection port to be used as locking support for barrel which\nwas an invention of British Whiting covered by a patent at last decade of last century, and this concept is \nstill most used on Tilting Barrel Types...\n\nIn fact, long years of experience showed that, only the one rib over the barrel to work with full contact against\ncounter recesses cut in the slide during a period nearly extending 10000 shots until the others to be weared in\nand only one rib would be necessary for Colt 1911 type hidden locks, and therefore, S?g Sauer type single \nshoulder against to the ejector port front would  provide all  security for Tilting Barrel Lock. Besides, if the correct\ndepth of ribs not calculated well, the "wear in" time can not be considered to enlarge the contact surfaces ,since\nhammering counter recesses by recoil does not presses the slide material to the rear, but swells to downside as\npushing the locking barrel out of engagement eventually lessening the locking contact surfaces.\n\nOne another handicap of Tilting Barrel  pistols is the inherent tendency of giving flyers on first and last rounds. \nThis is a combination of elevating barrel and reloading force applied by recoil and magazine springs.\n\nMost notable feature of this system is the strenght coming from the fact of most large contact surface between\nbarrel and slide as dissipating the pressure occured during discharge to larger area as compared to the other\ntwo kinds and really either Turning Barrel or Swinging Block types use maximum the half of Tilting Barrel system\nif measured.', ''),

Let me try to clear your confusions and answer your questions. \n\nIf we only talk about those shots i fired few days back (this particular experiment) then here are the possible answers:\n\nAns 1:\nYes the Kick from the gun is lesser then a normal shot, hence the force was not as much as a normal shell does. \n\nAns 2:\nIf Kink and force of the shots are not as a normal then of-course spread-fire would also be different than normal shells \n\nAns 3:\nIn my last experiment I experience different sounds, like i already mentioned about a misfortune happened with few shots. Sounds depends upon shell''s weight load and its tight sealing.  If projectile (load) would be heaver  OR Sealing would be tight enough to make good compression inside the shell then sound would be louder (more like same as a normal shot) \n\nBut in my case i used very light loads  both in Plastic Clay and Lead Pellets  (same quantity shown in my first posted photo) actually this time my main objective was to test its accuracy and it did pretty well so next time i do consider other possible  things.  \n\nThanks for your appreciation ... \n\nregards,', ''),

Those guyz I believe wanna shoot near to "free of cost" rounds, where did all the saving go in this case, with the Glock gone? :rolleyes:[/quote]\n\nReloading is a hobby in itself. The savings are significant even in the US. Plus there are many more advantages like suiting the bullet to your particular rifle, when, one shoots a lot on paper, one finds that every rifle does not shoot all bullets accurately, rifles and also pistols have a liking for a particular bullet, again bullet wt, type of base and shape and to an extent the powder type and the velocity one loads it to.\nBesides the seating depth of a rifle bullet in the cartridge case has a lot to do with accuracy in rifles and this varies greatly. \nThe Factory ammo is designed to fit and perform acceptably well in all makes and types of rifles and hence is a compromise; where as the hand loaded ammo by an experienced and knowledgeable hand loader is tailored for one particular rifle and gives amazing accuracy and optimum safe velocities that can be obtained from each particular rifle.\nI hope I have been able to explain why we love to handload. By the way a 44 Magnum Revolver bullet cost about 300 Rs or more, but when I cast and reload the same it costs me hardly Rs 3/- or may be 4 only. A 7mm Magnum premium bullet from RWS or Federal premium costs about Rs 600 to 700/- but when reloaded with Nosler Partitions , or Ballistic Tips it cost me from  Rs 30 to Rs 60/- only. Primers cost about dollar 10 per 1000, Powder is about dollar 12 a pound which is enough for about 130 cartridges, the Ballistic Tips are $ 15 a hundred and the Partitions are for about $ 50 or so a 100.\nMany years back when we could bring these goodies by air the prices were about 50% less now I think one can only bring Bullets; some one will have to find out if powder and primers can be brought in checked baggage or not', ''),

Fire a single shot at a time and practice the breathing technique as mentioned earlier. At this distance with any reasonable gun/ammo combo you should not go out of an inch or so. \nConsistency is most important, learn to deliver single well aimed shots first, you will have to work hard before you go to rapid fire techniques.\nKeep it up', ''),
